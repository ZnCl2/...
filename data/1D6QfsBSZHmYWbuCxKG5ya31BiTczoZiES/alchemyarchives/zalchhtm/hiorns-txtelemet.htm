PREFACE. 

THE following pages constitute a purely elementary treatise on Metallurgy adapted to the capacity of beginners, and dealing rather with general principles than detailed processes, many of which are only suitable 
for more advanced students. It is hoped that by simplifying the subject in this way, some may be induced to take up its study who have been hitherto deterred by the formidable array of matter presented in the larger manuals. 

The work is arranged to meet the requirements of pupils preparing for the elementary stage of the Science and Art Department's Examinations in Metallurgy and includes the examination questions set by the Department for the last twenty years in the three stages of the 
subject. 

The lectures of Professor Chandler Roberts-Austen 
  
at the School of Mines, and the works of Percy, Gruner, 
Kerl, Phillips, Watts, Bauerman and Greenwood, have 
been largely drawn upon. The author also thankfully 
acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. G. C. Marks, C.E., 
for his kindness in executing the whole of the drawings 
and to Mr. J. H. Stansbie for reading the proof sheets.

ELEMENTAKY METALLUEGY. 

CHAPTEE I. 

INTRODUCTION. 

Metallurgy (from the Greek " metallon," ore, metal ; and " ergon," work) is the art of extracting metals from their natural state, and preparing them for various manufacturing purposes. There is a tendency at the present time to expand the subject so as to embrace the various methods in which metals are employed for industrial uses. 

Most metals in their natural state differ widely from their condition after subjection to the various smelting and refining operations by which they are separated from other matters associated with them in the earth. Ores of metals occur in two ways, viz., in the metallic state, the metal being free or simply mixed with other metals and in a state of chemical combination, which is by far the more common. 

Metallurgy is essentially a chemical art, so that the metallurgist necessarily requires a knowledge of the laws of chemistry. But the physical properties of a metal are as important as the chemical, and as metals 
 

cannot 'be^profitalily. extracted and worked without mechanical contrivances, sometimes of an extensive and complicated kind, the metallurgist should not be ignor ant of physics and of the principles of mechanics. 

The present work will be confined entirely to the consideration of a limited number of the metallic elements known as the "useful metals," which are iron, copper, zinc, lead, tin, antimony, arsenic, bismuth, nickel, cobalt, mercury, silver, gold, platinum and alu minium. These metals are chiefly found in nature in the form of compounds which must be decomposed in order to isolate the contained metal. The reduction is generally effected by the agency of heat, so that some knowledge of the nature and properties of fuel is requisite. Most metallurgical operations are conducted at high tem peratures, thus requiring furnaces built or lined with some material capable of withstanding excessive heat without melting or decomposing, and the present work would be incomplete without some explanation of the refractory materials employed in making bricks, crucibles, and furnace linings. Further, it is not only necessary to reduce a compound to the metallic state, but also to form and fashion the metal by means of hammers, rolls, presses, etc., in order to prepare it for industrial purposes. The nature of such mechanical contrivances will therefore be briefly alluded to. 

A metal may be separated from its ore by 

1. The agency of heat, termed the "dry way." 

2. Solution and precipitation, termed the " wet way." 

3. The agency of electricity, termed the " electro- chemical way." 

 
DEFINITION OF METALLURGICAL TERMS. 

Ore. An ore is a substance containing a metal in its 
natural state, chiefly as sulphide, oxide, or carbonate, and 
less frequently as arsenide, chloride, sulphate, phosphate, 
and silicate. Some metals, such as gold and platinum, are 
usually found in the free state, termed " native," which 
is the case occasionally with copper, tin, silver and other 
metals. Metallic substances rarely occur alone in nature, 
being generally mixed with the various minerals in 
which they are embedded, constituting the " vein stuff," 
" matrix," or " gangue," which may consist of carbonates, 
such as calc-spar, witherite, limestone ; silicates, such as 
felspar, hornblende and mica ; sulphates, such as heavy 
spar ; and fluorides, such as fluor-spar. The gangue is 
separated by the miner, as far as it is expedient to do 
so by mechanical operations, such as crushing, sorting, 
washing, etc., known as " dressing," before the ore is 
delivered to the metallurgist. 

Reglllus and Speise. Certain metals, such as copper 
and silver, possess a strong affinity for sulphur and may be 
converted into sulphides by fusion with such bodies as 
iron pyrites, or the sulphates of barium and lime. The 
sulphide thus formed is called a " Regulus " or " Matt." 
In a similar way the metals nickel and cobalt are con- 
verted into arsenides by their combination with arsenic ; 
the arsenide is then termed a " Speise." In smelting 
ores containing iron, copper, nickel, arsenic, sulphur and 
silica, three products may be obtained, viz., nickel speise, 
copper regulus and iron slag. 

Reduction. When a metal is isolated from its state 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



of combination, it is said to be reduced and the agent 
effecting the reduction is called a reducing agent. Re- 
duction may be partial or complete. Thus, a compound 
may be reduced from a higher to a lower state of com- 
bination, or completely reduced to the metallic state. 
For the purposes of reduction a metallic compound is 
generally converted into the state of oxide, if not already 
in that form. Compounds of metals, like gold, silver, 
platinum, and mercury, may be reduced by heat alone. 
Sometimes, as in the case of sulphides, the compound is 
partially roasted to oxide, and then on raising the tem- 
perature the two bodies react on each other with separa- 
tion of the metal. The chief reducing agents in the dry 
way are carbon, carbonic oxide, hydrogen and hydro- 
carbons. 

When carbon is employed and the oxide is easily 
reducible, carbonic acid is formed ; but when the tem- 
perature is such that carbon will reduce carbonic acid, 
then carbonic oxide is produced, which is always the case 
with ores difficult to reduce. Thus : 

2PbO + C = C0 2 + Pb 2 . 
ZnO + C - CO " + Zn." 

The various processes by which a metal is reduced by 
the agency of heat is called " smelting." 

Calcination. This is a preliminary operation (resorted 
to in the case of many ores) by which volatile matter is 
partially or wholly expelled, by heating the substance to 
a temperature below its melting point, thus rendering it 
more porous and more suitable for the subsequent 
smelting. 



METALLURGICAL TERMS. 



Roasting 1 . When metalliferous matter, especially in 
a finety-divided state, is oxidized by heating it in contact 
with air, it is said to be roasted. In some cases, as in 
the roasting of lead sulphide, the oxidation may be par- 
tial, sufficient unaltered sulphide being left to react on 
the oxide so as to isolate the metal, thus : 



In some cases it is desirable to collect the gaseous pro- 
duct. The chamber containing the metalliferous matter 
is then often isolated from the chamber along which the 
flame passes. 

When chlorine gas is passed over the substance in- 
stead of air, the operation is termed a chlorinizing 
roasting. 

Distillation is the operation of driving off a volatile 
substance by heat in the form of vapour, and condensing 
it to a liquid in some cool receptacle. Mercury and zinc 
are extracted from their ores by a distillation process. 

Sublimation is a process analogous to distillation, 
except that the substance set free is condensed in the 
solid state, such as arsenic for example. 

Liquation. In some cases one or more of the con- 
stituents of a mixture may be separated from the rest by 
taking advantage of their different melting points : thus, 
when a mixture of lead and copper is raised to the fusing 
point of the former, the greater part of the lead flows 
away or liquates out from the unmelted copper. In this 
way tin is freed from iron and arsenic ; sulphide of anti- 
mony and native bismuth from their associated gangues, 
etc. 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



Scorification. The word " scoria" strictly refers to 
the fusible compound containing one or more useful 
metals, which is produced by the union of a suitable 
flux with the extraneous materials of the ore or metall- 
iferous matter, such as silicate of lead (2PbO,SiO.,). When 
such a compound contains only earthy bases, such as lime 
or alumina, it is termed a " slag," such as silicate of lime 
(2CaO,Si0 2 ). In this country the term slag is in use for 
both kinds of such compounds. Scorification is the oper- 
ation of converting the foreign substances present in a 
metallic compound into a slag or scoria, and the vessel 
in which such a change is effected on the small scale is 
called a scorifier. 

Cupellation. This operation is performed in a vessel 
made of bone ash or wood-ash, called a " cupel," and has 
for its object the removal of base metals by oxidation in 
conjunction with lead. The vessel being very porous 
(unlike a scorifier) absorbs the metallic oxides, leaving 
the unoxidizable metals on the cupel. This method is 
used in the extraction of gold and silver from ores and 
other bodies containing them. 

Amalgamation is, strictly speaking, the union of mer 
cury with other metals, but the term is applied to the 
whole process in which mercury is used to extract metals, 
such as gold and silver, from their ores, the mercury 
being subsequently driven off by heat, leaving the noble 
metals in the pure state. 

Occlusion. Graham has shown that a palladium tube 
when heated is capable of absorbing a large quantity 
of hydrogen gas, and other experimenters have shown 
that metals exert a selective influence on gases, thus 



PROPERTIES OF METALS. 



iron absorbs carbonic oxide very readily ; silver occludes 
oxygen, and platinum has a considerable absorptive 
power for hydrogen and oxygen. 

Cementation. When metallic matter is heated with- 
out melting in contact with an oxidizing re-agent, so that 
certain impurities are oxidized by the gas slowly pene- 
trating the mass little by little, the process is an " oxidiz- 
ing cementation," as in the production of malleable cast 
iron. 

When wrought iron is strongly heated in contact with 
carbon or carbonaceous matter, it gradually unites with 
a portion of the carbon, converting the iron into steel. 
This is a " carburizing cementation." Cementation then 
is the reaction which takes place between two bodies 
without fusion. 

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS. 

Mercury is the only metal liquid at the ordinary tem- 
perature. All the rest are solid and all are opaque, 
except in very thin slices. Gold leaf, for example, 
transmits a greenish light. With regard to colour, 
gold is yellow, copper red, the remaining metals white 
or greyish white. The high reflective power of metals 
confers on them a particular brilliancy called metallic 
lustre. The influence of heat on the different metals is 
very varied ; thus, tin, lead and zinc melt below a red 
heat; gold, silver and copper require a red heat; iron, 
manganese, nickel and cobalt an intense white heat; 
platinum only melts at the temperature of the electric 
arc or that of the oxy-hydrogen flame.

Some metals, such as zinc, arsenic, and antimony, readily 
vapourize when heated, arsenic being the most volatile. 
Arsenic passes directly from the solid to the gaseous form 
when heated, without being liquefied. If, however, it 
be heated under great pressure liquefaction takes place. 
All metals are volatile when raised 'to a sufficiently 
high temperature. 

The following table by Pouillet will give an idea of 
the temperatures corresponding to different colours :

Metals expand when heated and contract on cooling, 
and within certain limits the expansion is proportional 
to the degree of heat. Certain anomalies however exist, 
thus Cast iron expands at the moment of becoming 
solid, and solidified bismuth occupies a larger space than 
when in the liquid state. 

Tenacity. The property of resisting rupture by 
traction. The power possessed by different metals of 
sustaining weights is very diverse, and influences the 
purposes to which they may be applied. To test the 
tenacity, wires or rods of equal diameters are taken, and 
a gradually increasing load applied at one end until 
rupture occurs. The weight required to produce rup- 
ture varies with the molecular condition, and with the 
manner in which the stress is applied. Cast rods are 
weaker than drawn ones ; fibrous iron has a higher 
tenacity than crystalline iron ; the resistance is greater 
when the weight is applied at once, than when gradu- 
ally added. The relative tenacity of metals is as 
follows : Lead, tin, zinc, gold, silver, platinum, copper, 
iron and steel ; lead being lowest. 

Toughness is the property of resisting fracture by 
bending or torsion, as shown in the case of the metals 
copper and lead. 



10 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

Malleability. When a body can be flattened under 
a hammer or between rolls without cracking, it is said to 
be malleable. If it breaks it is termed brittle. Malle- 
ability depends on softness and tenacity. During the 
working of metals their molecules are forced into un- 
natural positions and require occasional annealing or 
softening by heat to bring them to their normal state. 
Gold is the most malleable of metals, combining the 
two properties of softness and tenacity in the highest 
degree. The metals follow in order, thus : Gold, 
silver, copper, tin, platinum, lead, nickel, zinc and iron. 

Welding". Many metals can have two clean surfaces 
joined together by pressure forming one compact mass. 
This property is possessed by iron at a white heat, but 
lead and gold will adhere at the ordinary temperature. 

Ductility. When a metal can be drawn into wire, 
or lengthened by a tensile force, combined with lateral 
compression, without breaking, it is said to be ductile. 
The ease with which it may be reduced will depend on 
its softness, but the thinness will depend on its tenacity, 
which property has more influence on the ductility of 
metals than on their malleability. 

Elasticity or temporary elongation is an attribute of 
the harder metals, as well as " sonorousness," which is 
very marked in some of their alloys. 

Odour and Taste. Many metals when rubbed or 
raised in temperature emit a characteristic odour, and 
when applied to the tongue produce a peculiar taste, 
even when chemically pure. The latter can hardly be 
due to voltaic action. 

Conductivity is the power different bodies possess 



PROPERTIES OF METALS. 



11 



of transmitting heat and electricity. The conducting 
power of metals for heat is probably in the same order 
as for electricity. A very minute trace of an impurity 
will seriously affect this property. One half per cent, of 
iron in copper will reduce its conductivity 60 per cent., 
and a much smaller quantity will make it unfit for 
many electrical purposes. The conducting power of 
metals is diminished by a rise in temperature. The 
following is the probable order of conductivity : Silver, 
copper, gold, tin, iron, nickel, lead, platinum, antimony, 
and bismuth. 

Specific gravity is the number which expresses the 
weight of a body compared with that of an equal bulk 
of water. This number determines the use of a metal 
for many purposes thus, gold on account of its high 
specific gravity is convenient as a circulating medium, 
and aluminium on account of its lightness is very 
useful for small weights.

Hardness, like many other physical properties of a 
metal, is often considerably increased by mixture and 
by presence of impurities, so that softness in many cases 
is a test of purity. 

Specific heat is the number which expresses the 



12 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

capacity for heat which a body possesses, compared with 
that possessed by an equal weight of water. Different 
bodies varying in this respect will require different 
amounts of heat to raise equal weights from to 1 C.

Alloys. By uniting two or more metals in various 
proportions, an almost infinite variety of modifications 
may be obtained, possessing more or less the properties 
of their constituents. The effect of this combination is 
generally to increase the hardness, lower the melting 
point and otherwise modify the physical properties of 
the constituent metals. Thus, a small amount of lead 
in gold makes it very brittle. Some metals mix when 
melted and separate on cooling, such as zinc and lead. It is 
difficult to determine whether there is true chemical 
combination between the components of an alloy, as 
the alteration of physical characters, which is the 
distinctive feature of chemical combination, does not 
to any great extent take place. In some cases, as when 
copper and zinc are melted together, great heat is 
evolved, indicating chemical action, and the stability of 
alloys is greater in proportion to the chemical dissimi- 
larity of the contained metals. 

The action of solvents on alloys is sometimes very 
different from their action on the constituent metals in the 



PROPERTIES OF METALS. 13 

separate state : thus, platinum is insoluble in nitric acid, 
but is dissolved when alloyed with much silver ; silver 
alloyed with much gold is not affected by nitric acid, but 
when the silver is in large excess the silver is completely 
soluble, together with some of the gold. 

Varieties of fracture. The character of the fractured 
surface of a metal or alloy often affords a general guide 
as to its properties and adaptability to various uses. 
Zinc, antimony, spiegel-eisen, etc., are crystalline ; grey 
pig iron, steel, bronze, etc., are granular ; wrought iron 
and nickel are fibrous ; copper is finely fibrous and silky. 
Some malleable metals, such as tin, when heated to a certain 
point and struck with a hammer, or allowed to fall from 
a sufficient height, when on the point of melting, assume 
a columnar structure, and certain brittle alloys break like 
glass with a conchoid al fracture. 

Dry process. By this term is understood the extrac- 
tion of metals by the agency of heat, three substances 
being generally employed, viz., fuel to produce heat, or 
to produce the metal, and flux to combine with the 
foreign matter present in the ore. 

Wet process. In this method the metalliferous 
matter is first dissolved by a suitable solvent, such as the 
common acids, common salt, ammonia compounds, acid 
sulphates and certain mineral waters, and then precip- 
itated by a certain re-agent. In some cases the sub- 
stance is first treated by a gas such as chlorine or sulphur- 
ous acid and then by a wet method. Some metals after 
being brought into a state of solution are precipitated by 
other metals more positive than themselves ; thus, copper 
is precipitated by iron, and silver by copper. 



14 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



Electro-chemical process. In this method the 
substance is first brought into the liquid state by fusion 
or by solution, and then decomposed by the passage of a 
current of electricity. Probably the greatest success has 
been achieved with copper compounds, because copper 
when deposited is generally very free from impurities. 
With metals of less intrinsic value, the power required 
is too costly, unless cheaper methods of producing 
electric currents than are known at present can be devised. 
Even then the deposited metals would probably not be 
pure like copper. 

Crystallization. The brittle metals such as anti- 
mony, bismuth and zinc exhibit a well defined crystalline 
structure on their fractured surfaces, and malleable 
metals may have the same structure induced under certain 
circumstances. All metals appear to crystallize either in 
the cubic or rhombohedral system. 

Metals may crystallize (1) on solidification after fusion, 
(2) by condensation from the state of vapour, (3) by 
electrolytic decomposition of metallic solutions. Slow 
cooling after fusion appears to be the condition most 
favourable for the formation of good crystals. In some 
instances a crystalline structure is induced by vibration, 
as in the case of iron and brass. Some combinations 
containing different elements may have one constituent 
separated from the rest by crystallization, such as graphite 
from cast iron, lead from argentiferous silver, zinc from 
lead, etc. Many metals which are deposited from their 
solutions by electricity, such as silver and copper for 
example, may be obtained in a crystalline condition by 
using a weak current. 



SLAGS AND FLUXES. 15 



CHAPTER II. 
SLAGS AND FLUXES. 

Slags, with a few exceptions, are formed by the union 
cf metallic oxides with silica and are termed silicates. 
They may be stone-like, glassy, or crystalline. Rapid 
cooling tends to produce the glassy variety, slow cooling, 
to produce the crystalline condition. The crystalline or 
stony condition of slags depends on the nature of the 
constituents. They are generally vesicular from the 
escape of enclosed gases. Some slags when melted are 
as liquid as water, others are viscous. If a slag is made 
too thin, it is liable to contain too much metal ; if too 
thick, the metal does not properly subside. When a 
slag is free or nearly free from metal it is said to be 
" clean." With regard to fusibility, etc., Berthier states : 

1. Weight for weight soda fluxes better than potash. 

2. A mixture of soda and potash is better than either 
alone. 

3. Alkaline silicates are always glassy. 

4. Alkaline silicates make other silicates fusible when 
mixed with them. 

5. Only those silicates of baryta fuse well which 
contain less baryta than BaO,Si0 2 , and less silica than 
BaO,6Si0 2 . 



16 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

6. With respect to silicates of alumina, Al 2 3 ,3Si0 2 and 
2Al 2 3 ,9Si0 2 soften most with heat and any addition 
of silica or alumina diminishes the fusibility. 

7. Alkalies, alkaline earths and the earths, flux 
silica in proportion to their chemical energy, that is, in 
the following order : Potash, soda, lime, magnesia, 
baryta, strontia, oxide of iron and alumina. Among 
the common bases alumina is the least fluxing. 

A slag consists of two portions, the acid such as silica 
and the base such as alumina. But alumina may act the 
part of base in one compound as (2Al 2 0,3Si0 2 ), and 
the part of acid in another as in the natural mineral 
"spinel," ZnO,Al 2 3 . The former would be called a 
silicate and the latter an aluminate. The aluminate of 
lime or of magnesia is infusible, but the fusibility is 
increased by forming double aluminates. Silicates may 
be classified as follows : 

Monosilicates, 2MO,Si0 2 or MS. 

Sesquisilicates, 4MO,3Si0 2 or M 2 S 3 . 
Bisilicates, MO,Si0 2 or MS 2 . 

Trisilicates, 2MO,3Si0 2 or MS 3 . 

A flux is a substance added to metalliferous substances 
to unite with the foreign matter and form a fusible slag. 
The flux employed in any case varies with the nature of 
the gangue, which is generally either siliceous or basic. 
A siliceous gangue requires a basic flux and likewise a 
basic gangue, a siliceous flux. The gangue of an ore may 
be self fluxing and require no additional flux. A single 
silicate with one base is less fusible than a double or 
multiple silicate with two or more bases. Thus ores of 



REFRACTORY MATERIALS. 17 

iron containing silicate of alumina, have lime added as a 
.flux, so as to form a double silicate of lime and alumina. 

Fluor-spar as a flux acts on silicates in two ways : 
1. By combining with the silicate to form a fusible 
compound. 2. By decomposing the silicate, forming 
gaseous silicon fluoride (SiF 4 ). Fluor-spar is a useful 
flux for the sulphates of barium, calcium, and strontium, 
and for bone-ash, but it has no action on sulphides. 

Sulphides are for the most part fusible per se, but 
they are generally roasted to oxides. Certain sulphides 
as ZnS, are made fusible by the addition of iron pyrites. 
By means of sulphur or arsenic small quantities of copper 
and nickel may be removed from other oxides in the 
form of regulus or speise. 

EEFRACTORY MATERIALS. 

In any hearth or furnace where a high temperature is 
desired, it is necessary that it should be lined inside 
with a material capable of withstanding the heat and 
scorifying action of the matter operated upon, without de- 
composing. Such materials are either used in the natural 
state, such as silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, oxides of iron 
and fire-clay, or they are made to undergo a certain 
preparation. In some cases the natural materials are 
moulded to the internal shape of the furnace. If they 
are not of a plastic nature, such as lime and magnesia, 
then tar or some other binding material is added to give 
the necessary plasticity. Fire-bricks are generally made 
of lire-clay mixed with burnt clay and white sand which 
prevents the bricks cracking, without increasing the 



18 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

fusibility. The composition differs with the purposes for 
which they are designed. In some cases they are 
required to withstand a high and prolonged temperature 
without softening ; in others to withstand great pressure ; 
in others to resist the corrosive action of metallic oxides, 
and in others to withstand great and sudden changes of 
temperature. 

Crucibles, etc., are made of various mixtures of clay 
in the raw and burnt state, or the same mixed with coke 
dust or plumbago. A good crucible should be tough, 
infusible, capable of withstanding sudden changes of 
temperature without cracking, and should not be readily 
corroded by metallic oxides. The most infusible crucibles 
are those made with clays containing the largest amount 
of silica, and the smallest quantity of lime and oxide of 
iron. A good crucible may be made with two-thirds 
fire-clay and one-third burnt fire-clay and coke dust. The 
refractory nature of fire-clays used for crucibles, fire- 
bricks, etc., may be tested by moulding a piece in form 
of a pyramid with sharp edges, drying, and then exposing 
to a high temperature in a crucible lined with charcoal. 
If only the edges show signs of fusion, the clay is mode- 
rately refractory, if the clay fuses it is useless for high 
temperatures. 

Graphite, blacklead or plumbago crucibles are made 
of fire-clay mixed with varying proportions of plumbago 
or coke dust. Instead of using blacklead crucibles, clay 
ones lined with charcoal paste are often employed. Such 
a crucible is said to be brasqued (Fig. 1). The paste 
may be made by mixing treacle with the charcoal, press- 
ing in the mixture and cutting out the central part 



CRUCIBLES. 



19 



with a knife, or a cavity may be made by a wooden 
plug. 

The following crucibles are in general use for assaying. 
1. French. These are of excellent quality, smooth and 
carefully made but somewhat Fig. i. Fig. 2. 

brittle (Fig. 1 a). 2. London, 
These crucibles have a reddish 
brown colour, are close in grain, 
refractory and well resist the 
corrosive action of metallic oxides 
(Fig. 2). 3. Cornish. These 
crucibles are refractory but of 
a more acid character than the 
preceding and thus more readily 
attacked by metallic oxides (Fig. 
3). 4. Hessian. These are use- 
ful crucibles, refractory, not 
readily corroded, but somewhat frangible and liable to 
crack with sudden changes of temperature (Fig. 4). In 
making large crucibles for melting brass, steel, etc. (Fig. 
5), a mixture of Stourbridge clay with other refractory 
clays, such as China clay, Derbyshire clay, and plumbago, 
coke dust and burnt clay are employed. Good plumbago 
crucibles resist sudden changes of temperature without 
cracking and may be used several times until they are 
worn too thin to bear the weight of the metal. Crucibles 
of all kinds should be carefully annealed before using, by 
heating in an inverted position over the furnace. 

Refractory materials are either acid, such a3 ganister 
and Dinas clay ; neutral, such as fire-clay ; or basic, such 
as dolomite, bauxite, alumina, etc. 




20 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

A. substance is called acid, neutral, or basic, when the 
acid is greater, equal to, or less in equivalence than the 
base. This distinction will be seen by reference to the 
composition of the above bodies : 

Ganister = Si0 2 89-5, A1 2 3 4'8, Fe02-8, CaO-1, K 2 O1. 

Dinas Clay = Si0 2 98'3, A1 8 '7, FeO2, CaO2, K g O-l, 
OH 2 -5. 

Kaolin, which is the purest form of fire-clay, contains 
40 per cent. Si0 2 , 45 A1 2 3 , and 5 OH 2 . 

Dolomite (CaO,C0 2 + MgO,C0 2 ). In this case the 
carbonic acid is removed by heat, leaving the oxides of 
calcium and magnesium, which are entirely basic. 

Bauxite = A1 2 3 5 2, Fe 2 3 27'6, water 20-4. 

Fire-clays are essentially hydrated silicates of alumina, 
which resist exposure to high temperatures without 
melting or softening. They contain varying amounts 
of lime, magnesia, oxide of iron, potash, etc., and some 
mechanically mixed silica. The tendency to fuse or 
soften increases with the amount of oxide of iron and 
potash. The plastic property, or the power of being 
moulded into various shapes, which clays possess, is 
due to the chemically combined water. The mineral 
Kaolin, mentioned above, may be considered as pure clay 
and probably forms the basis of all clays. 

FURNACES. 

A hearth, forge, or furnace is an arrangement for 
conducting metallurgical operations by the agency of 
heat. The inside is generally lined with refractory 
material and the outside constructed of ordinary building 



FURNACES. 



material. The bed of a furnace as a rule is lined with 
.basic material, which does not readily act on metallic 
oxides ; but the roof, which only comes in contact with 
the flame, is made of refractory acid materials, such as 
Dinas clay. 

All furnaces may be classified under three types : 
1. Without an independent fireplace as an iron blast 
furnace. 2. With an independent fireplace as a rever- 
beratory furnace. 3. Closed muffles as in zinc distilling. 
They may be used with a natural draught, the air being 
aspirated by means of a chimney; or the air may be 
forced in with bellows or similar means. In both cases, 
the heat developed depends on the calorific power and 
weight of fuel burned in a given time ; also on the mode 
of combustion, for if the carbon is completely burned to 
carbonic acid, more than three times the heat will be 
produced than when only carbonic oxide is formed. 

We will call No. 1 the barrel type ; the ore, fuel and 
flux being placed together in the same receptacle. No. 2, 
the reverberatory type, contains two compartments, one 
in which the fuel is burnt, and the other where the metal 
or mineral matteris operated upon, called the "laboratory." 
The barrel type is favourable for reducing-fusion, but the 
reverberatory type is more oxidizing and suitable for such 
operations as require the combined action of heat and air. 
The fuel may be solid or gaseous, in which latter case the 
arrangement is called a "gas-furnace." The chamber 
where the gas is produced is called a gas generator or 
producer, and by this agency temperatures are now 
obtained previously unknown. 

Besides the fireplace and laboratory there is another 



22 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



essential structure connected with a reverberatory furnace, 
called the stack or chimney. It may be used either for 
creating and maintaining the draught, or for carrying off 
the products of combustion. The chimney is generally 
connected with the laboratory by a " flue " of varying 
length and more or less horizontal. The draught is 
regulated by a damper either in the 
flue or on the top of the chimney. 
Some furnaces have a fireplace in 
the centre and the flame passes right 
and left, as in the cementation of 
iron to form steel. (See Fig. 28.) 
These are called "gallery " furnaces. 
Some have the fireplace more com- 
pletely isolated than in the ordinary 
reverberatory. The laboratory space 
is covered with a dome which is 
pierced with one or more openings connected with the 
chimney. The fireplace is under or at the sides of the 
laboratory, and the gaseous products of combustion 
penetrate into the laboratory by a number of openings 
(Fig. 6). 

The atmosphere of a reverberatory furnace will depend 
to some extent on the depth of fuel on the grate ; for 
when this is too great the combustion will be incomplete 
and carbonic oxide with free hydrogen will be largely 
formed, producing a more or less reducing atmosphere. 
With a thin layer of fuel and good draught, the atmos- 
phere will be oxidizing, carbonic acid and water being 
chiefly produced. 




Fig. 6. 



HOT AIR. 



23 



HOT AIR. 

If the air supplied to a furnace be previously heated, 
the temperature of combustion will be increased, and 
although fuel is used in heating the blast there is still 
a margin on the side of economy, for more complete 
combustion occurs and a more rapid working is realized. 
If the waste heat be used in heating the air, then the 
saving is still greater. Two principles are applied for 
heating air, viz., "Conduction" and "Regeneration." 

The principle of conduction is employed when the air 
is passed through cast-iron pipes which are heated 
externally. (See Fig. 21 a.) Or the walls of a gas pro- 
ducer may be made hollow so that the air for combustion 
of the gas may pass through such passages, as in the 
Boetius method (Fig. 7). Or the air may be heated by 




passing through a channel underneath the bed of the 
laboratory as in the Bicheroux furnace. Or what is 
termed a "recuperator" may be employed. In this 
arrangement the waste gases from the furnace, and air, 
pass in opposite directions through alternate channels in 
a specially made brickwork chamber. (See Fig. 26.) 



24 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



The system of heating on the regenerative principle was 
developed by Sir William Siemens and so named by him 
because the waste heat was restored again to the furnace. 
The regenerators are chambers of open refractory brick- 
work built in pairs, two pairs being required for each 
furnace, each pair being used alternately for absorb- 
ing the heat of the gaseous products from the furnace, 
and heating the gas and air required for combustion. 




Fig. 8. 

Fig. 8 shows the furnace in vertical section, with the 
regenerators beneath the bed. The larger chamber in 
each pair is used for heating the air and the smaller for 
heating the gas. By means of a reversing valve the 
waste gases pass to the right or left pair at will. When 
the waste gases are passing down through the right pair, 
the cold air and gas are passing up through the left pair, 
the direction being reversed when sufficient heat has 
been absorbed. 



SIEMENS' GAS PRODUCER. 



25 



The bed of the furnace is formed of sand, consolidated 
by pressure and strong heating, and supported by a 
framework of cast-iron. The roof slopes from each end 
to the centre, thus giving a more plunging flame. 

The Gas Producer is a nearly rectangular chamber 
lined with fire-brick (Fig. 9). The side A is formed of 
iron plates lined with fire-bricks 
having a step grate B and 
wrought iron bars c. The fuel 
is charged through the hopper 

D. The gas passes up the pipe 

E, which is cased with iron, and 
into a horizontal wrought iron 
pipe which conveys it to the 
regenerator. The combustible 
portion of the gas consists chiefly 




Fig. 9. 



of carbonic oxide (CO) called "air" gas. When a jet of 
steam is introduced into the generator the gas liberated 
contains hydrogen; it is then called " water " gas. The 
gases generated in gas producers for metallurgical pur- 
poses contain from 25 to 34 per cent, carbonic oxide, 55 
to 60 per cent, nitrogen, the remaining portion consisting 
of carbonic acid, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons. 

The effect of water vapour or steam on incandescent 
carbon is to form hydrogen, marsh gas, carbonic oxide, 
and carbonic acid. The effect of oxygen is to produce a 
mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, the relative 
proportion of which will depend on the amount of oxygen 
admitted. Now hydrogen is a reducing agent, and will 
act on carbonic acid, reducing it to carbonic oxide ; so 
that a certain proportion of steam admitted with the air 



26 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

iii generating producer gas tends to increase the amount 
of carbonic oxide, and thus enhance the value of the gas 
as a combustible. The amount of steam admitted should 
never exceed 10 per cent, of the air, otherwise the cool- 
ing effect of the water vapour will be greater than the 
heating advantage gained by the liberated hydrogen. 



FUEL. 27 



CHAPTER III. 
FUEL, 

BY this term is meant substances that may be burned 
in air to give heat capable of being applied to economic 
purposes. The two chief elements employed are carbon 
and hydrogen. The latter in fuels being always asso- 
ciated with carbon. In all fuels containing carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen, the proportion of hydrogen may 
be equal to, or greater than, but never less than that 
required to form water with the oxygen. The amount 
of hydrogen united with oxygen is not available as a 
source of heat, so that the excess of hydrogen over this 
amount is called " disposable " hydrogen, and the amount 
in combination, the "non-disposable" hydrogen. 

Calorific power. The amount of heat a body is 
capable of yielding when completely burned is termed 
its calorific power. The calorific power of different bodies 
is given in the following table : 

Wood charcoal, - 8080 

Gas carbon, 8047 '3 

Artificial graphite, 7762-3 

Native graphite, - 7796*6 

Diamond, - 7770'! 

Carbonic oxide, - - - 2403 



28 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

Carbon when burnt so as to form| 

carbonic oxide, - j 

Marsh gas (CH 4 ), 13063 

Olefiant gas (C 2 H 4 ), - 11857 

Native sulphur, - 2249 

Amorphous silicon, - 7830 

Crystallized silicon, - 7540 

Phosphorus, 5747 

Iron, - 4134 

Hydrogen, - 34462 

The number 8080 for wood charcoal signifies that 
1 Ib. of that body when completely oxidized to carbonic 
acid will produce sufficient heat to raise 8080 Ibs. of 
water 1 C. ; and so on for the rest. The calorific power 
of a fuel containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen would 
be the sum of the calorific powers of the carbon and that 
of the disposable hydrogen. 

The calorific power of a compound of carbon and 
hydrogen, such as C 2 H 4 , may be calculated thus : 

C 2 = 24)The atomic weight of carbon being 12 and 

H 4 = 4 i that of hydrogen 1 . 


. 28 

Then if 1 Ib. be taken, y will be carbon and i will be 
hydrogen. \ of 8080 = 6925-7 

\ of 34462 = 4923-1 

11848-8 

Many hydrocarbons yield a less calorific power by 
experiment than by calculation, probably owing to the 



CALORIFIC INTENSITY. 29 

heat absorbed in their decomposition. Experiment and 
calculation perfectly agree, only when the two elements 
are mechanically mixed, and not when they are chemi- 
cally combined. 

Calorific intensity. The pyrometric degree of heat 
obtained when a body is completely burnt is termed its 
" calorific intensity." This is the actual temperature of 
the products of its combustion, and will vary with their 
weight, specific heat, pressure, and the atmosphere in 
which the combustion takes place. In the case of hydro- 
gen, the product is a condensable vapour, and it is 
necessary to deduct from its calorific power the amount 
of heat rendered latent by the water vapour produced. 

Suppose 12 grains of carbon to unite with 32 grains 
of oxygen to form 44 grains of carbonic acid, or 1 grain 
of carbon to unite with 2-6 grains of oxygen to form 3*6 
grains of carbonic acid, thus 

C-f 2 = C0 2 , 

and the whole heat produced absorbed by this C0 2 ; that the 
pressure is constant and that the specific heat of C0 2 



- -2164; thenthecalorific intensity = -.-- = 10174. 

3-8 x -2164 

Now suppose the carbon burnt in ordinary air instead 
of oxygen. In this case nitrogen has to be heated 
without yielding anything to the calorific power. One 
part of oxygen in air is mixed with 3'35 parts of nitro- 
gen, so that the weight of nitrogen to be heated when 
1 part of carbon is converted to carbonic acid is 
2-6 x 3-35 - 8-93. The specific heat of nitrogen is -244. 



Calorificmtensity = - - = 2718C. 

(3-6 x -2164) + 8-93 x -244 



30 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

The calorific intensity of carbonic oxide (CO) when 
burned in oxygen according to the equation, 

00 + = 00* 
is 7073. One part of CO forms 1-57 parts of C0 2 , then 



the calorific intensity = - . ,, = 7073, 

2403 



In furnaces, heat is lost by radiation, conduction, and 
dissociation; as well as by imperfect combustion. 

Pyrometer. The heat of a furnace is measured by 
an instrument called a " pyrometer." It must be capable 
of giving a constant indication for the same temperature 
and must not change with use. 

1. Wedgwood's pyrometer is based on the shrinkage 
of dehydrated clay. Spherical pieces with one side flat 
and of equal size are employed. He assumed that the 
shrinkage was proportional to the temperature. 

2. Daniell's pyrometer is based on the principle that 
the expansion of a platinum or iron rod is proportional 
to the temperature. 

3. Siemens' pyrometer depends on the increase of 
electrical resistance in a conductor, such as platinum, 
when heated. 

4. Bystrom heats a ball of platinum in the furnace 
whose temperature is to be measured, and then causes it 
to roll down an inclined clay tube into water, and com- 
putes the temperature from the rise in temperature of 
the water. 



COAL. 31 



WOOD. 

Wood is composed of organic tissue called cellulose, 
and a little other organic matter. Cellulose may be re- 
presented by the formula C 6 H 10 5 , and contains 44 - 44 
per cent, carbon, 6*17 per cent, hydrogen, and 49 '3 9 per 
cent, oxygen. The inorganic matter which forms the 
ash when wood is burnt varies from 1 to 2 per cent., 
and consists chiefly of carbonates of potash and lime. 
When wood is well air dried it retains 18 to 20 per cent, 
of water, which may be removed by heating it at a tem- 
perature of 120 C. Wood for fuel should be of mature 
growth, and felled when most free from sap. 

PEAT. 

Peat is -the product of the alteration of various vege- 
table substances, chiefly mosses, under the combined 
influence of air and water, which induces a slow decom- 
position. The deeper the peat, the darker and denser it 
is, and the less the remains of vegetable structure. Peat 
will absorb and retain as much water as wood. It con- 
tains more carbon and less oxygen and hydrogen than 
wood, but has contracted several impurities from the 
earth, the ash reaching from 5 to 6 per cent. The ash 
consists of carbonates, silicates, sulphates, and phosphates 
of potash, soda, lime, alumina, magnesia, and oxide of 
iron. Peat is sometimes prepared for metallurgical 
purposes by being strongly compressed. 

COAL. 
Coal is of vegetable origin, and resembles wood and 



32 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

peat in character, the more modern the formation in 
which it is found. It may be divided into three distinct 
classes Lignite, Coal, and Anthracite the first being 
the newest formation and the last the most ancient. As 
the series descends, the oxygen diminishes and the 
carbon increases ; but the chief characteristic of differ- 
ent kinds is the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen, and the 
carbon left on distillation in a closed vessel. In lignites 

the ratio varies from 6 to 5, and the coke is below 50 
M 

per cent. In coal the ratio - varies from 4 to 1, and the 

rl 

coke from 50 to 90. In anthracite the ratio is 1 or 

M 

less than 1, and the coke exceeds 90 per cent. 

Lignite. Four types may be distinguished fossil 
wood, earthy lignite, dry lignite, and bituminous lignite. 
Fossil wood is that variety where the woody structure is 
still apparent, while bituminous lignite more or less re- 
sembles ordinary coal, into which it insensibly passes. 

Coal is distinguished from lignite by a more pro- 
nounced black colour, greater density, more friability, 
more lamellar structure, absence of woody fibre, a greater 
yield of coke, less water in the products from distillation, 
and that rather basic than acid, and the absence of the 
disagreeable odour of lignite when burning. In the 
natural state, coal contains little water and is less hygro- 
scopic in air than wood or lignite. 

Coal, by its appearance, properties, and composition, 
forms a continuous series from lignite to anthracite, with 
no definite line of separation. The proportionate yield 



COAL. 33 

of coke is from 50 to 90 per cent., and the elementary 
composition as follows : 

Carbon, 75 to 93 

Hydrogen, - 6 to 4 

Oxygen, 19 to 3 

100 100 

The first column belongs to coal bordering on lignite, 
the second column to that approaching anthracite. Be- 
tween these extremes are varieties having intermediate 
properties. . 

Coal may be conveniently divided into five classes 
based on the yield of coke and action in the fire : 
1. Long flaming coal; 2. Gas coal; 3. Forge coal; 4. 
Caking coal ; 5. Lean or anthracite coal. 

Anthracite coal is generally friable, of a pure black 
colour and lustrous, which varies with the hydrogen pre- 
sent. Much ash makes it harder, denser, and less bril- 
liant in appearance. The combustibility and volume of 
flame depend on the amount of volatile matter present. 
The earthy matter or ash is chiefty clay, more or less 
siliceous and ferruginous, with varying amounts of car- 
bonate and sulphate of lime, a little alkali, and occasion- 
ally some phosphates and arseniates. The colour of 
the ash varies from white to red according to the 
amount of oxide of iron, the coloured ash being the 
most fusible. This forms pasty masses when the coal is 
burnt, called clinkers, which choke up the bars of the 
fireplace. The calorific power increases from flaming 
coal to anthracite coal. Sulphur is always present in 



34 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

coal, either as sulphate of lime or iron pyrites, or both, 
and in combination with the organic constituents of the 
coal. 

Anthracite is compact, of a deep black colour, lus- 
trous, bordering on the metallic, brittle, breaks with an 
uneven or conchoidal fracture, has a high degree of 
hardness and cohesion ; it inflames and burns with diffi- 
culty, giving an almost smokeless flame. Some varieties 
easily decrepitate. It yields neither water nor bitumen 
in sensible quantities when heated, and the fragments 
neither fuse, change their lustre, nor cake together. 

Petroleum. In various parts of the earth are found 
combustible bodies similar to " petroleum." They are 
solid, liquid, and gaseous hydrocarbons, rich in carbon. 
Marsh gas and olefiarit gas are gaseous. Petroleum 
proper is liquid. The asphalte of Mexico is a kind of 
solid petroleum which fuses below 100 C. An ana- 
logous compound, " Boghead " of Scotland, which is a 
bituminous schist, is richer in bitumen than ordinary 
coal. When the earthy matter diminishes to the pro- 
portion present in ordinary coal, it takes the name of 
" cannel " coal. The natural mineral called jet occupies 
an intermediate place between coal and petroleum. It 
is a bituminous lignite, and disengages, when heated, 
55 to 60 per cent, of volatile matter, containing 5 to G 
per cent, of hydrogen. 

PREPARED FUEL. 

Certain fuels, such as soft peat, coal dust, etc., are unsuit- 
able for use in the natural state, but may be prepared by 
compression, as in peat ; or caked, as in coal dust, by 



CHARCOAL. 35 

mixing with coal tar, pitch, or other cementing 
material. Wood and peat have their calorific powers 
increased by artificial drying. 

Wood charcoal. When wood is heated to a tem- 
perature of 400 C. out of contact with air ; water, acetic 
acid, tar, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, hydrogen, marsh 
gas, etc., are given off, and a black, sonorous, hard 
mass of charcoal is left. At a lower temperature it is 
more or less brown, feebly sonorous, but more tenacious 
than black charcoal. Charcoal always retains some 
oxygen and hydrogen, but the amount is less the higher 
the temperature employed in its production. The ash 
left on combustion is 3 to 4 per cent., and of the same 
character as that of wood. 

Peat charcoal. The shape of the peat is preserved 
like wood, when heated in closed vessels. It is black in 
colour, porous, soft when prepared from peat in its native 
state, and more compact and dense when prepared from 
compressed peat. It retains some volatile elements, like 
wood charcoal. 

When steam is passed over red-hot charcoal, hydrogen, 
carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, and a little marsh gas are 
formed. 

MODES OF MAKING CHARCOAL. 

1. In piles. The ground should be dry, well sheltered, 
and near a water supply. The bed is slightly inclined 
from the circumference to the centre. One or three 
stakes are first driven in the ground in the centre of the 
circle, long enough to reach above the upper extremity 
of the intended mound. Around this, the wood cut into 



36 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

suitable lengths is packed as closely as possible, being 
placed in a vertical or horizontal direction, and all irre- 
gular spaces filled up with small twigs. The wood is 
then encircled and covered with branches, and the upper 
portion with turf and charcoal dust, leaving a small part 
open at the base for the escape of aqueous vapour during 
the first stage. The space between the three stakes is 
filled with readily-inflammable wood, which is ignited to 
start the operation. The wood in the central part of 
the pile is charred first, then covered up, the combustion 
proceeding from top to bottom and from the centre to the 
outside of the heap. Vents are made at suitable intervals, 
commencing at first near the top, and closed when the 
carbonization in that region is complete, which is judged 
by the pale blue colour of the smoke (Fig. 10). 




2. In some cases rectangular piles are used ; in others 
the charring is effected in kilns and in ovens. The heat 
by which the carbonization of wood is effected in piles is 
produced by the combustion of charcoal itself, and not 
by the burning of the products of carbonization. The 
yield varies with the nature of the wood, its age, dry- 
ness, and the temperature and mode of charring. By 



COKE. 37 



volume the yield varies from 50 to 75, and by weight 
from 15 to 28 per cent. Peat is carbonized in much the 
same way as wood in piles, kilns, and in ovens. 

COKE. 

Coke is obtained when coal is strongly heated in a 
closed space or vessel with a limited supply of air. It 
may be porous and light, or dense and compact ; it is 
sometimes soft and tender ; at others, hard and resisting. 
The colour varies from black to grey, the lustre being in 
some cases dull, in others, bright and almost metallic. 
The quality depends on the coal and mode of coking. 
Nearly all coals contain iron pyrites (FeS 2 ), and a part of 
the sulphur remains in the coke. The coke from caking 
coal has the appearance of a porous, partially melted 
mass, which is grey in colour, with a semi-metallic lustre. 
The coke from flaming coal is lighter and more friable. 
The rapid carbonizing of a small charge gives a lighter 
and more friable coke than the slow baking of a heavy 
charge. Dry coke with little ash is lighter than 
water. It is hygroscopic like charcoal, but in a less 
degree. Coke is less inflammable and less combustible 
than charcoal, but produces a higher temperature on 
burning. 

Coking in piles. Coking is effected in circular and 
rectangular piles, like charcoal. A rough chimney of 
toose bricks is first constructed, 6 feet high, capped with 
a damper, and the coal arranged around it, making a 
mound 30 feet in diameter at the base. The whole is 
then covered with wet slack, except a space around the 




38 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

bottom. Ignition is effected by placing live coals on one 
side of chimney, near the top, and continued by opening 
vents in different parts, as in charcoal burning. The 
coking is completed in about six days. 

Coking in kilns. Two parallel walls (AA, Fig. 
11), 5 feet high and 8 feet apart, lined with fire-brick, 
A c JL.A are first built with a series 

of openings (BB), 2 feet 
apart, and the same dis- 
|B tance from the floor, so 
arranged that those on 
Fig - n - one side are opposite to 

those in the other wall ; and from each of these ascends 
a vertical flue (cc). Any of these flues may be stopped 
by closing with a tile so as to divert the current in any 
given direction. To charge the kiln, one end is bricked 
up, wet slack is wheeled in, spread in layers and stamped 
down, reaching nearly to the level of BB. Wood stakes 
are now placed across, the ends reaching into the corre- 
sponding opening in the opposite wall. The coal is then 
wheeled in, watered, stamped down, the other end 
bricked up, and the whole covered with loam. The 
stakes are now withdrawn, and the kiln lighted by 
inserting inflammable sticks. The charring is completed 
in about eight days. The whole is allowed two days to 
cool, and the coke is then withdrawn. 

COKING IN OVENS. 

The beehive oven (Fig. 12) is a somewhat circular cham- 
ber of brickwork with an arched roof, having a chimney 



COKE OVENS. 39 




opening at the top for the escape of the products of 
combustion and vapours. The cavity is about 9 feet to 
10 feet in diameter, and 3 feet to 
4 feet high. The charge is in- 
troduced through a doorway in 
front, about 2J feet square, 
through which the charge is also 
withdrawn. These ovens are gen- rig.i2. 

erally built in two rows back to back, with a charge of 
three tons in each, which reaches up to the springing of 
the dome of the roof. When the charging is complete, 
the doorway is loosely filled up with bricks, through the 
openings of which the air can pass. Supposing the oven 
to be hot from a previous charge, in three hours the 
lower holes are closed, and in twenty-four hours the 
upper ones are closed. The oven is now allowed to 
remain twelve hours with the chimney open. When the 
flame ceases, the damper is closed, and the oven allowed 
forty-eight hours to cool. The charge is then withdrawn 
by means of a large shovel suspended by a crane, and 
the hot coke quenched with water. 

Cox's Oven is a nearly rectangular fire-brick chamber 
of the beehive type, closed with an iron door lined with 
fire-brick. The coking space has a double arched roof, 
forming a space through which the gaseous products pass 
before reaching the chimney, so as to utilize some of the 
waste heat. At each side of the door is an opening 
leading by a flue to openings in the back of the chamber, 
for the introduction of air heated by passing through this 
flue, thus raising the temperature of the oven. The 
coking chamber is slightly wider in front, and the floor 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



also slopes from back to front, which facilitates the with- 
drawal of the charge. 

Appolt's oven. Eighteen vertical retorts of brick- 
work are built in two rows of nine each, the whole being 
contained within four brickwork walls. 
Each retort is surrounded by an air 
space, 8 to 10 inches wide. The retorts 
(Fig. 13) are taper, measuring 1 foot 
1 inch by 3 feet 8 inches at top, and 
1 foot 6 inches by 4 feet at base, and 
16 feet high. Each is provided with a 
cast-iron door at the bottom, opening 
into an arched vault, into which the 
coke is dropped at the conclusion by 
opening this door. The air spaces 
surrounding each retort communicate 
with one another, forming one large 
divided chamber, which communicates with the inside of 
the retorts by openings in the brickwork. It is in this 
divided chamber that combustion of the products of de- 
composition of the coal takes place, air being admitted 
through holes in the outer sides of the kiln. The oven 
is charged with coal at the top, and the time of one 
operation, starting with hot retorts, is about twenty-four 
hours. 

Coppe'e's oven (Fig. 14). This oven is constructed 
on the Appolt type, being heated by combustion of the 
waste gases on the exterior. It is only used for finely 
divided coal, its chief advantages being rapid coking and 
an increased yield. Some coals not sufficiently bitumin- 
ous for coking in an ordinary oven may be coked in the 




Fig. 13.

Coppee oven. There is some saving of labour and a 
utilization of the waste gases. The gaseous products 
pass through open- 
ings in the upper part 
of the vaulted roof 
of each oven into ver- 
tical side flues, into 
which air is admitted. 
After combustion, 
the flame passes to 
a bottom flue, giving 
up a portion of its 
heat to the bottom of 
the oven. 

Simon-Carve's 
oven (Fig. I4=a). Each oven is a long, narrow, and 
high brickwork chamber, A, resembling that of Coppee, 
with horizontal flues penetrating the side walls, as 
shown in dotted outline, BB. These flues communicate 
with two horizontal flues, CC, running under the floor 
of each chamber. The products of combustion from 
the fireplace, E, pass through CO, and then ascend to 
the uppermost of the side flues, BB. From thence 
they traverse backwards and forwards along the sides of 
the chamber, finally passing into the flue D, and thence 
into the chimney. The products of carbonization are 
drawn off by an exhauster through F and the valve G 
into condensers, where the gases are freed from the 
ammoniacal liquors and tarry oils with which they are 
associated. The gases are then brought to the fireplace, 
E, by a pipe, p, and ignite as they pass over the burning 



42 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



fuel. The resulting flame then traverses the bottom and 
sides of the oven as described before. The temperature 
of the oven is further increased by admitting hot air for 
the combustion of the gases circulating round the oven. 




Fig. 14 a. 

The coal for coking is charged through the hoppers, 
HH. When the charging is complete, the passages, KK, 
are closed, and the doors closing the ends of the ovens 
carefully luted to prevent admission of air. This pre- 
vents loss of coke by combustion at the surface of the 
charge, and 15 per cent, more coke is obtained than is 
produced in an ordinary beehive oven. 

Composition of gases. The composition of the gases 
liberated from coke ovens during coking varies with the 
time and mode of coking. The mean of some experiments 
by Ebelmen gave 10-93 per cent, of carbonic acid, 3-42 
carbonic oxide, 1-17 marsh gas, 3-68 hydrogen, and 80-80 
nitrogen, the first and last being non- combustible. The 
waste gases of coke ovens have been utilized for heating 



DESULPHURIZATION OF COKE. 43 



the ovens themselves, heating boilers, and for the 
recovery of tar, ammonia, etc. 

Coke may be desulphurized: 1. By heating to 
redness, and passing through it a stream of superheated 
steam; 2. by adding compressed oxygen ; 3. by mixing 
lime with the coal before coking. The last method ap- 
pears to be the most successful, and although the lime 
containing the sulphur remains with the coke, the sul- 
phur has little tendency to pass from the lime into 
the metal which is being heated in contact with the 
fuel. The chemical changes in the three methods may 
be represented thus

CHAPTER IV. 

IRON (Fe). 

ALTHOUGH iron is very widely distributed throughout 
the earth, the minerals constituting the workable ores of 
iron belong to a limited class, consisting chiefly of oxides 
and carbonates, mixed with varying proportions of lime- 
stone, silica, clay, or bituminous matter, and frequently 
with small quantities of phosphates arid sulphides. Some- 
times arseniates and titauates are present. 

Native iron probably occurs only in meteoric masses. 

Magnetite, or magnetic iron ore, is the richest ore of 
iron. Chemical formula, Fe 3 4 . It occurs crystallized 
in the cubic system and massive ; it is black or iron-grey 
in colour, brittle, magnetic and sometimes polar, and 
gives a black streak. When pure it contains 72-41 per 
cent, of iron. 

Franklinite is somewhat similar to magnetite, and 
contains about 45 per cent, of iron, 10 per cent, of 
manganese, and 20 per cent, of zinc. 

Red haematite occurs in a variety of forms. 
Chemical formula, Fe 2 3 . It contains when pure, 70 per 
cent, of iron. Its colour varies from deep red to bluish 
grey, and it gives a red streak. The following are the 
different varieties : Specular iron we, of a bluish grey 



IRON ORES. 45 



colour, and crystalline. Micaceous ore is scaly or foliated, 
and used for red paint. Kidney ore occurs in hard, com- 
pact nodular masses. Pied ochre is a compact earthy 
variety. Puddlers' we is a compact form used as a 
fettling for furnaces. 

Ilmenite, or titaniferous iron ore, crystallizes similarly 
to hematite, generally occurs massive, of a dead black 
colour, and gives a brownish streak. The typical chemi- 
cal formula may be taken as FeO,Ti0 2 . 

Brown haematite is a hydrated ferric oxide. Chemi- 
cal formula, Fe 2 3 + xH 2 0. It varies in colour from 
blackish to yellowish brown, and gives a yellowish 
brown streak. The following are the different varieties : 

Gothite occurs crystallized, scaly and fibrous, with a 
colour varying from rust-yellow to black. Chemical 
formula, Fe 2 3 ,H 2 0. It contains 63 per cent, iron when 
pure. Limonite, or brown iron ore, is compact and earthy. 
Chemical formula, 2Fe 2 3 ,3H 2 0. Bog ore is also a 
brown haematite. 

Spathic iron ore, Siderite, Clay ironstone, Black- 
band, and Cleveland ironstone are different vari- 
eties of the carbonate of iron (FeC0 3 ). Siderite when 
pure yields 48-27 per cent, of iron. It varies in colour 
from yellow to brown, and has a pearly lustre. It often 
contains oxide of manganese, and when smelted produces 
" spiegel-eisen." It gives a white streak. Clay ironstone 
is the carbonate mixed with clay, and llackband is 
the same compound containing bituminous matter. 
Cleveland ironstone is a less pure variety of clay iron- 
stone, containing a large quantity of phosphates. 

Iron pyrites is only used as a source of iron after the 



40 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

sulphur has been removed in the manufacture of sul- 
phuric acid, when the resulting oxide of iron is known 
as "Blue Billy." 

Chemistry of iron. Atomic weight, 56. Pure iron 
is not used in commerce, but it may be obtained by 
reducing the pure oxide or carbonate with hydrogen, or 
by electrolysis of a solution of ferrous chloride or 
sulphate, or by re-melting the best malleable iron with 
nitre. The red oxide may be reduced by hydrogen at a 
temperature of 400 C., producing iron in the form of a 
black powder, while at a high temperature a silvery 
white sponge is formed. It melts at about 2000 C., is 
powerfully magnetic, and forms two classes of salts- 
ferrous and ferric. Its specific gravity is 7 '87. 

It oxidizes in moist air, forming hydrated ferric oxide 
(Fe 2 3 + Aq), which, by electrical action on the iron, 
causes the oxidation gradually to penetrate the whole 
mass. When heated to redness in air, the black oxide 
(Fe 3 4 ) is formed. Hydrochloric acid attacks iron, forming- 
ferrous chloride (FeCL). Sulphuric acid dissolves it, 
forming ferrous sulphate (FeS0 4 ). Fuming nitric acid 
has no action on iron, but the ordinary acid dissolves it 
with the formation of ferrous nitrate (Fe2N0 3 ). 

Iron and Oxygen unite in three proportions. 1. 
Ferrous oxide (FeO), which rapidly oxidizes in contact with 
air, and unites with acids to form ferrous salts. 2. Ferric 
oxide (Fe 2 3 ), which is red in colour and occurs in 
nature as haematite. It unites also with water, forming 
ferric hydrate. 3. Magnetic or black oxide of iron 
(Fe 3 4 ) this forms the richest ore of iron, and from 
which some of the purest iron is obtained. 



COMPOUNDS OF IRON. 47 

Iron and Phosphorus unite direct at a red heat, form- 
ing phosphide of iron. When oxide of iron is reduced 
by carbon in presence of an earthy phosphate, phosphorus 
is separated and unites with the iron. Wrought iron 
containing T V^ n P er cen ^- of phosphorus is not much 
affected in tenacity, but is harder ; \ per cent, makes it 
cold short, and 1 per cent, makes it very brittle. The 
effect of phosphorus on iron is to impart a coarsely 
crystalline structure, diminish its strength, increase its 
fusibility, and render it cold short. The presence of 
phosphorus in cast iron diminishes its strength, but on 
account of its fusibility is useful in making fine castings. 

Iron and Arsenic readily unite when heated together. 
Arsenic makes iron red short, white and very brittle. 

Iron and Sulphur combine to form sulphide of iron. 
The effect of sulphur in small quantities is much the 
same as arsenic. 

Iron and Silicon combine to form silicon-iron. When 
iron is strongly heated in contact with silica and carbon, 
the silica is reduced to silicon, which unites with the 
iron. The effect of silicon on cast iron is to set the 
carbon free, so that, as a rule, the greyer the pig the 
higher is the amount of silicon present. Silicon makes 
iron hard, more fusible and brittle. 

The slags produced in purifying pig iron consist 
chiefly of basic silicate of iron (2FeO,Si0 2 ). When 
this silicate is heated with access of air, a very refractory 
substance is formed, called " bull-dog," consisting largely 
of oxide of iron, and an acid fusible silicate liquates out, 
called " bull-dog slag." 

Iron and Carbon, These two elements readily unite 



48 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

together when strongly heated. The effect of carbon is 
to harden iron and lower its melting point. It exists in 
cast iron in two states free and combined. When the 
carbon is chiefly in the free state as crystallized graphite 
or kish, the iron is called grey ; when the carbon is mostly 
in the combined form, the iron is called white ; when the 
carbon is present in about equal amounts of free and 
combined, the iron is called mottled. Iron containing 
carbon chiefly in the free state is said to be soft, while 
the combined carbon renders it harder and more brittle. 
Cast or pig iron is iron containing more than 1J per 
cent, carbon. When the amount of carbon is about -25 
per cent., the metal can be sensibly hardened by making 
it red hot and quenching in water, it is then called steel. 
Iron is capable of taking up and retaining about 5 per 
cent, of carbon, and a much greater quantity if manganese 
be also present. The amount of carbon usually present 
in cast-iron is from 2J to 3J per cent. 

ALLOYS OF IRON. 

Gold alloys with iron, making it harder and more 
fusible. Platinum when present in iron to the extent of 
1 per cent., makes it fine-grained, tenacious, tough, and 
ductile. Copper-tin alloys unite with iron, which 
increases the strength of the bronze. The same remarks 
apply to copper zinc alloys. Copper in iron makes the 
iron or steel red short, and pig iron containing a notable 
quantity of copper is unsuitable for making wrought 
iron. Tin and iron form a useful alloy in tin plate. A zinc 
and iron alloy is formed in galvanizing. 



PROPERTIES OF IRON. 49 

Manganese very frequently occurs in iron ores, and is 
reduced along with the iron. White pig iron containing 
5 to 10 per cent, of manganese is known as spiegel-eisen. 
When large quantities of manganese are present, the 
alloy is called ferro-manganese, which is hard, crystalline, 
and brittle ; it may contain 75 to 80 per cent, of man- 
ganese. These bodies are extensively used in steel 
making. 

Chromium alloys with iron, making it hard, white, 
brittle, and more fusible. 

Tungstic acid, in the presence of iron and carbon at a 
high temperature, is decomposed, the tungsten alloying 
with the iron to form a hard, fine-grained white steel of 
great tenacity. 

PROPERTIES OF IRON. 

Malleable iron is of a greyish white colour, having a 
granular, crystalline, or fibrous fracture, according to the 
mode of treatment. AVhen rolled or hammered hot, the 
iron becomes fibrous, but continued cold hammering 
induces a crystalline or granular structure, making it 
hard and brittle. The nature of the fractured surface 
varies also with the manner in which the iron has been 
broken, for specimens broken by progressively increasing 
stresses are invariably fibrous, whilst the same specimen 
broken by a sudden blow will be crystalline. The pre- 
sence of impurities generally tends to impart a granular 
or crystalline fracture, and makes the iron less malleable. 
When impurities, such as sulphur and arsenic, render 
the metal unworkable at a red heat, it is said to be hot 



50 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

or red short. On the other hand, some substances, such 
as phosphorus, cause iron to crack when hammered cold, 
it is then termed cold short. The specific gravity of 
iron is about 7*7 : its fusing point is said to be about 
2000 C. ; but before melting it assumes a pasty form, at 
which point two pieces may be joined together by 
welding. To ensure a good weld the surfaces must be 
clean and the metal at a white heat. In order to 
dissolve any scale, the smith adds a little sand, which 
unites with the oxide and forms a fusible silicate. When 
steel is being welded a mixture of borax and sal-ammoniac 
is preferred to dissolve the scale. The presence of any 
foreign bodies such as carbon, silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, 
copper, oxygen, etc., increases the difficulty of welding. 
Iron possesses considerable malleability, ductility, and 
tenacity. Its tensile strength ranges from 17 to 30 tons per 
square inch, but this like all the other physical properties 
is modified by the presence of impurities, which tend to 
make it harder, more fusible, and brittle. When iron is 
heated to dazzling whiteness, it burns, forming Fe 3 4 , 
the iron becoming friable and brittle, termed "burnt 
iron." Iron may be magnetized by bringing it in contact 
with a magnet, but it loses its magnetism when the 
exciting magnet is withdrawn. Its specific heat is 
1137; its conductivity about 170, silver being taken as 
1000. Its electric resistance is 5-8 times that of pure 
copper. Iron when exposed to moist air readily 
rusts or oxidizes, so that it is often coated to pre- 
vent this action, as for instance, by tinning, galvan- 
izing, and painting. Prof. BarfF preserves iron from 
rusting by exposing it at a red heat to superheated 



PREPARATION OF IRON ORES. 51 



steam, which imparts to it a coating of the black oxide 
(Fe 3 4 ). 

PREPARATION OF IRON ORES. 

In some cases poor argillaceous ores are separated 
from clay and sand by sifting, crushing, and washing. 
Clay ores occurring with shale in the coal measures may 
be largely separated from the shale by "weathering." 
In like manner pyritic ores are oxidized by the combined 
action of air and moisture forming soluble sulphates, 
which are washed away to a great extent by rain. If 
the "weathering is pushed too far, the whole mass, espe- 
cially when much limestone is present, will crumble to 
powder. When the sulphur in a spathic ore does not 
exceed *3 to '5 per cent., then 2 to 3 per cent, of lime 
and magnesia is sufficient to combine with the sulphuric 
acid. For regularity of working, the ore and flux 
should be reduced to small lumps of uniform size, 
which size should be proportional to the height of the 
furnace. 

Calcination and Roasting. All ores, except massive 
red haematite and certain magnetites, are calcined pre- 
viously to reduction. This process has several advan- 
tages : 1. The amount of iron is concentrated in a less 
weight of matter. 2. The ore is rendered less porous 
and some impurities are removed. 3. Protoxide com- 
pounds of iron are oxidized to sesquioxide which does 
not unite with silica. Magnetite by roasting is also con- 
verted into ferric oxide (Fe. 2 3 ). 

Roasting is performed in piles, in stalls, or in kilns. 
The first and second methods are adopted where fuel is 




52 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

cheap, but the operations are wasteful and imperfect. 
Roasting in kilns yields a more uniform product, with 
economy of fuel. One of the best forms is that of Gjers 
(Fig. 15), largely used in the Cleveland district. The 
body is of fire-brick cased with wrought 
iron plates. The diameter at base is 
about 14 feet, at the boshes about 20 
feet, and at top about 18 feet. The 
bottom of the brickwork rests on cast 
iron plates, and the whole is supported 
on cast iron pillars. In the centre of 
the kiln is a cone about 8 feet in height 
Fig. 15. and the same in diameter at the base. 

The total height is about 30 feet and the capacity about 
6000 cubic feet. From two to three days are required 
for the roasting, with the consumption of 1 cwt. of coal 
per ton of ore. When the operation is complete, the 
ore is discharged at the bottom between the pillars, 
being directed outwards by the cone. 

At some works the kiln is cylindrical and the heat 
supplied by the waste gases of the blast furnace. 

Processes for the extraction of iron from its ores may 
be classed under two heads, viz., "Direct" and "In- 
direct " methods, which are represented in a general 
manner in the accompanying scheme (Fig. 16). 

In the direct method the ore is reduced to iron or steel, 
in arrangements, such as the Catalan forge and Siemens' 
rotator, then hammered, re-heated and finished with the 
hammer or rolls. In the indirect method, the ore is 
calcined, reduced in a blast furnace, run into pig moulds, 
refined (or puddled direct), puddled, hammered, rolled,

54 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

re-heated, and finished in the rolls for bar iron. If steel 
is desired, the bars are heated with carbon in the 
cementation furnace, then melted in crucibles for cast 
steel. 

In the old method, the finery and open fire were used 
instead of the puddling and re-heating furnaces. 

Pig iron is treated in the Bessemer converter for 
Bessemer steel ; in the Siemens' furnace for Siemens' 
steel ; and melted in the cupola for foundry purposes. 
The bloom of iron produced in the rotatory furnace may 
be made into steel by treating it in the Siemens' open 
hearth furnace. 

DIRECT METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

Catalan process. This is a survival of the ancient 
bloomeries still said to be carried on at Catalan in the 
Pyrenees. It consists of a hearth made of sandstone, 
and lined with charcoal (Fig. 17). 
The back and opposite walls are faced 
with iron, and of the remaining sides, 
one is of rough masonry and the other, 
which forms the working side of the 
furnace, consists of two iron plates, 
the lower one having a hole for tap- 
e's- 1"- ping the slag. The top of this plate 
serves as a fulcrum for the workman's tools. The twyer 
is made of sheet copper, and generally inclines at an angle 
of 30 to 40 degrees, according to the degree of carboniza- 
tion desired. The blast is supplied by a blowing appar- 
atus called a trompe (Fig. 18). The water falling down

the pipe A, drags air through the inclined openings BB. 
This aerated water falling into the cistern is divided 
into two streams, the air rising and passing forward 
into the twyer, the water running out of the cistern 
at c. 

Haematites are smelted direct, but carbonates are first 
calcined. The ore in small pieces is charged in with 
charcoal, several lumps of charcoal being placed near the 
twyer. The heat is gradually raised until a pasty mass 
is formed, which is then 
pushed towards the twyer. 
After two hours the full 
blast is turned on and the 
slag tapped off. The slag 
is fluid and formed at the 
expense of the iron ; it is a 
silicate of iron (2FeO,Si0 2 ), 
containing lime, magnesia, 
and oxide of manganese, 
which composition is favour- 
able for the transference into 
the slag of any phosphorus 
that may be present. When 
the whole of the ore is re- 
duced, the blast is stopped, 
the spongy masses of iron 
worked into alump with iron 
tools, then carried to the shin- 
gling hammer and shingled.

fire, and the iron finished under the hammer. If the opera-

tion is prolonged and the twyer arranged at a smaller 
angle than in the above case, the iron combines with a 
certain amount of carbon and forms steel. The condi- 
tions governing the formation of slag in this hearth are 
similar to those of the puddling furnace and the reverse 
of those in the blast furnace, the former being oxidizing, 
the latter reducing. 

Sir C. W. Siemens adapted the principle of his re- 
generative furnace to the direct production of iron or 
steel in the rotatory furnace (Fig. 19). The cylinder is 




Fig. 19. 

8 feet in diameter and about 9 feet long and rests on four 
anti-friction rollers. The inside is lined with bauxite, 
which consists of alumina, ferric oxide, water and a little 
silica. From this substance, when mixed with 3 per cent, 
clay and 6 per cent, plumbago, bricks are made. The 
working door is at one end, and beneath this is a tap hole 
for slag. The furnace is heated with gas supplied from 
a gas producer, the air being heated \>y passing through

one of a pair of regenerators. Ore in small pieces is 
charged into the hot furnace with lime, and the cylinder 
rotated. When red hot, about 20 per cent, of small coal 
is added, and the velocity increased. When the reduc- 
tion is complete, the slag is tapped off; then a quick 
rotation is imparted to collect the iron into three or 
more balls, which is effected by means of projecting ribs 
on the interior surface of the rotator. The balls are 
then shingled, re-heated, and finished in the usual way. 
If steel is desired, 10 per cent, of spiegel-eisen is added 
after tapping off the slag. The charge is then melted 
and cast into moulds. In some cases the balls are treated 
for steel in the " open hearth " furnace. The advantages 
claimed for this method are economy of time, saving of 
fuel and purity of iron, since the metal is not brought in 
contact with solid fuel as in the blast furnace. 

INDIRECT METHOD OF EXTRACTION. 

The calcined ore is put into the blast furnace with 
coal, coke, or charcoal and a suitable flux, which is 
usually lime. The heat is well utilized and the re- 
duction more perfect than in any other form of furnace. 
In the blast furnace there are two currents travelling 
in opposite directions, and constantly acting on each 
other a "gaseous" ascending current and a "solid" 
descending one. The former travels at the rate of 
about 3 feet per second, the later at the rate of 3 
feet per hour. The effect of the blast on the carbon of 
the fuel is to produce carbonic acid (C0 2 ) at the level 
of the twyers with evolution of great heat. This gas 



58 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



ascends, and is reduced by carbon at a very short 
distance from the tvvyers thus, CO 2 + C = 200. This 
carbonic oxide is the principal reducing agent in the 
blast furnace, the oxide of iron being reduced to the 
metallic state as a spongy mass, thus 



At the same time the flux and earthy matter of the ore 
unite to form slag, which descends with the iron; the latter 
in contact with highly heated carbon is first carburized, 
then melts and collects in the hearth combined with other 
substances, such as silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, and 
manganese, which have also been reduced, constituting 
cast iron. On the top of the molten iron floats the 
liquid slag. The temperature and pressure have a great 
influence on the reducing action, and as the temperature 
of the furnace increases with the temperature and pressure 
of the blast, it follows that as the reducing energy becomes 
greater the metal is more impure. When very pure 
iron is desired, then rich haematite and cold blast are 
used, with charcoal as fuel. Great advantage is gained 
by the use of hot air, as less carbon is required for 
reduction and fusion. It is also useful to remedy 
defects and regulate the passage of materials in the 
furnace. If the fusion or reduction is at fault the 
temperature of the blast is raised, or more carbon is 
added to the furnace. The former acts promptly, while 
the latter often takes several hours to remedy the defect. 
The quality of the pig iron produced from a given 
furnace will depend on the temperature, the nature of the 
charge, and the mode of working. With easily reducible

ores and heavy burdens that is, with a large proportion 
of ore to fuel the iron will be white, since the metal 
is kept only the minimum time in contact with incan- 
descent carbon. With a high temperature and a light 
burden the pig iron is more siliceous and grey. The 
same things influence the character of the slag. Blast 
furnace slags are double silicates of lime and alumina, 
and may be represented by the formula 

3(CaO, Si0 2 ) + A1 2 3 , 3Si0 2 
or 

6(2CaO, Si0 2 ) + 2A1 2 3 , 3SiO, 

The former is the kind of slag obtained from charcoal 
furnaces, and the latter from furnaces using coke or 
coal. In both cases, the lime is replaced more or less 
by magnesia, oxide of iron, and oxide of manganese, 
while the silica is sometimes replaced to a small extent 
by alumina. The colour varies from white to grey, 
sometimes with varying shades of yellow, green, blue, 
and black, according to the metallic oxides present. 
Generally a white or grey slag accompanies grey iron, 
and a dark coloured slag, white iron. The former often 
contains excess of lime, which diminishes its fusibility ; 
the latter is more fusible and contains oxide of iron, 
which, when present in quantity, makes a very liquid 
" scouring " slag or scoria. When forge or mill cinders 
are added to the charge the resulting metal is called 
cinder pig iron, and the change may be represented by 
the following equation 

6(2FeO, Si0 2 ) + 40 = 2(2FeO, 3SiO 2 ) + 4C0 2 + 4Fe 2 
The "scouring" slag produced sometimes contains as 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



much as 20 per cent, of iron. When phosphoric acid 
is present in a blast furnace it is reduced, and the 
phosphorus passes into the iron, which can only be 
prevented by leaving much oxide of iron in the slag. 

The modern blast furnace (Fig. 20) is an elon- 
gated barrel-shaped structure, the height being from 
four to five times that of the greatest width, called a 
"cupola." The body is formed of wrought iron plates, 
| inch thick, riveted together, and within which is built 
the outer casing of ordinary masonry, the inside being- 
lined with fire-brick about 18 inches thick, while 
between the two layers of brickwork is a small space 
filled with sand to allow for ex- 
pansion and contraction. The 
body or stack is supported on a 
cast iron ring resting on iron 
columns, and the lower part, from 
the top of the columns to the 
tymph arch, is also cased with 
iron. The hearth is independent 
of the masonry of the stack, and 
is built in after the stack is com- 
pleted. It requires to be made 
of very refractory material of 
considerable thickness, having to 
withstand a very great heat, in 
addition to the corrosive action 
of the molten slags. In Fig. 20,

supporting the body, HH the pillars, I the hearth, K 
the twyers, L the dam, / the iron dam plate, m the 
fore-hearth. The dam is formed of fire-brick, and is car- 
ried up to the twyer level, a semi-circular notch in the 
top edge serving as a passage for the slag. The tap hole 
for the molten iron is a narrow slit through the bottom 
of the dam. The arch covering the fore-hearth is called 
the tymph arch (t). N is the opening for collecting the 
waste gases which are utilized for heating the blast, 
boilers, etc. 

The charge is tipped into the cup or hopper (x), and 
allowed to fall into the furnace by lowering the cone B, 
which acts very advantageously in distributing the 
charge over the surface of the materials already in the 
furnace. The hot blast twyer consists of a hollow 
conical wrought iron pipe, with double walls for the 
circulation of a constant stream of water and a central 
pipe connected with the blast main and inserted into 
the above conical pipe. 

The arrangements for heating the blast are of two 
kinds cast iron pipes through which 
the air passes, heated externally, and 
chambers of refractory brickwork con- 
structed on the principle of Siemens' 
regenerators, which are now in most 
general use. The use of the hot blast 
was patented by Neilson in 1828, and 
first adopted at the Clyde Iron Works 
for the blast furnace. It is now almost 
universally adopted. ^g. 21. 

Cast iron Stoves. Fig. 21 represents an old form of 




62 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



stove, which consists of a chamber containing a series of 
arched pipes of cast iron arranged in an oblong fire-brick 
chamber, along each of the long sides of which are two 
circular mains fitted with sockets into which the legs of 
the vertical pipes are received, while between the mains, 
and running the full length of the stove, is a rectangular 
fireplace. 

Of the " regenerative " type two principal forms are em- 
ployed, invented respectively by Cowper and Whitwell. 
The Cowper Stove (Fig. 2 la) is a circular wrought 

iron tower, closed with 
a dome-shaped roof, 
lined internally with 
fire-brick. It contains 
a circular fire-brick 
flame flue A, into which 
the waste gases from 
the blast furnace pass 
by the valve B. The 
body of the stove is 
occupied by a chequer 
work of fire-brick for 
absorbing the heat. 
The gas entering the 
flue A is there burnt, 
the necessary air for 
combustion entering by 
the valve C. The hot 
Fig. 21 a. products passing down 

through the chequer work make it red hot, and finally 
pass into the chimney flue D. 




WHITWELL'S STOVE. 



63 



The stove having been thus heated, the valves B, c, 
and D are closed, and the cold blast valve at the 
bottom of the stove opened, as well as the hot blast 
valve F. The cold air enters at the bottom or cooler 
end, and ascends through the brickwork, getting gra- 
dually hotter and then escapes by the valve r, which 
communicates with the blast furnace, at a temperature 
of about 800 C. Two stoves are worked in conjunction, 
one being heated by the combustion of the waste gases, 
while the other is being utilized in heating the blast. 
These stoves are 50 to 55 feet high, and 20 to 25 feet 
in diameter. 




Fig. 22. 



Whitwell's Stove differs from Cowper's, chiefly in 
the arrangement of the absorbing brickwork. The waste 
gases and air for combustion are admitted at several 



64 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

points of the stove, so that the combustion is more 
perfect. The regenerative brickwork is built so as to 
form a number of long and narrow vertical chambers, 
communicating with each other at the top and bottom. 
The blast furnace gases enter through A, and meeting 
with warm air introduced through suitable passages, 
combustion takes place, and the flame rising up C, 
passes down the narrow passages, x, to the bottom. 
Here more air is admitted to burn the unconsumed 
gases, which rise up D and down through another 
series of narrow channels, leaving at the chimney valve 
E. When the stove is sufficiently heated, which takes 
about two hours, the gas and chimney valves are closed 
and the blast valve opened, the blast passing in inverse 
order to that of the gases, as in the Cowper stove. 

The waste gases from a blast furnace contain by 
volume from 55 to 60 per cent, nitrogen, 23 to 28 per 
cent, carbonic oxide, 7 to 1 2 per cent, carbonic acid, 
about 2 per cent, marsh gas, and 2 to 6 per cent, of 
hydrogen. 

The iron tapped from the blast furnace is run into 
sand moulds, forming ingots about 3 feet long and 3 or 
4 inches in diameter, called pigs. 

Various methods have from time to time been devised 
for collecting the waste gases of a blast furnace besides 
the cup and cone contrivance already described. In 
some small charcoal furnaces the top is left open, and an 
annular space formed in the masonry at the upper end of 
the body of the furnace. This space communicates with 
the interior by a number of openings inclining upwards 
beneath the level of the charge, through which some of 



REFINING PIG IRON. 65 

the waste gases are drawn. In some cases a wrought 
iron cylinder is suspended in the mouth of the furnace ; 
in others a brick tube is built in the throat, being sup- 
ported by arms of brickwork. Langen withdraws the 
gases from the centre, instead of the sides, by suspending 
a bell above the throat, which bell can be raised by a 
lever for charging, the joints being kept tight by water. 

Sometimes the charge of a furnace is obstructed in its 
descent; the lower portion being melted and withdrawn, 
leaves a " scaffold," which, with the increasing weight 
from above, sometimes suddenly gives way and falls 
into the hearth. This is called a "slip," and deranges 
the working of the furnace. 

In some cases, large ferruginous masses, called " bears," 
are formed in the hearth of a blast furnace, often contain- 
ing iron, copper, silicon, graphite, manganese, nickel, 
cobalt and cyano-nitride of titanium, which is a com- 
pound resembling copper in colour. 

EEFINING PIG IRON. 

For the better qualities of wrought iron, crude pig 
iron was formerly submitted to a preliminary operation 
in a rectangular hearth, called a refinery (Fig. 23). A 
number of twyers are so arranged on two of its sides as 
to project a stream of air on to the molten iron, to oxidize 
its impurities. The iron is finally quenched by running 
it into an iron trough surrounded with water, thus caus- 
ing the carbon to remain in the combined form, which 
condition is necessary for puddling by the original or 
" dry " method, as white pig iron assumes a pasty state 
when strongly heated. 




66 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

The element whose chemical affinity for oxygen is 
greatest will absorb this gas first, and others will be 

oxidized in turn in pro- 
portion to their chemical 
energy. The order of oxi- 
dation will be as follows : 
Silicon, manganese, phos- 
phorus, sulphur, carbon 
and iron. But oxygen will 
-^ combine with the dominant 
$p^ metal by the influence of 
Fig. ?3. mass, so that refining slags 

always contain a large amount of oxide of iron. 

PfTDDLING DRY AND WET. 

The method of " dry puddling " in a reverberatory 
furnace was developed by Cort, and patented by him in 
1784. Each operation is composed of three periods 
fusion, rabbling, and forming the blooms. White or 
refined iron is chiefly used. About 4 cwts. of metal is 
charged into the furnace along with rich slags, and 
is partially melted in about half an hour, forming a 
pasty mass. It is then stirred with iron tools so as to 
bring all parts under the oxidizing influence of the air. 
As the impurities are removed, the iron becomes less 
fusible, requiring the temperature to be gradually raised. 
The particles of iron are then collected into balls by the 
puddler, each ball weighing about 80 Ibs. 

In " wet puddling," which has superseded the dry 
method, the preliminary refining is dispensed with. It 



PUDDLING. 67 

is characterized by the complete fluidity of the iron and 
the greater length of time required to remove the im- 
purities. The pigs submitted to wet puddling are siliceous 
or strongly carburized, and should contain manganese, if 
steel is desired. The action of manganese in puddling 
tends to retard the decarburization of the iron by reduc- 
ing Fe 3 4 to FeO, as carbon is especially removed by the 
oxidizing action of Fe 3 0^ so that as long as the iron con- 
tains manganese, its strong affinity for oxygen prevents 
Fe 3 4 being formed. Also slags containing oxide of 
manganese are more fluid and therefore more easily 
expelled from the iron by hammering and re-heating. 

The bed and sides of a modern puddling furnace are 
lined with refractory materials rich in oxide of iron. 
When the iron is melted, it is between two oxidizing 
influences the air and oxide of iron and the operation 
will be shorter and the product more uniform as the 
rabbling (or moving of the mass by the tools of the 
puddler) is more vigorous. The ferruginous slag formed, 
takes up oxygen from the air, causing FeO to pass into 
Fe 3 4 , which then oxidizes the impurities in the order of 
their oxidizability, viz., silicon, manganese, phosphorus, 
sulphur, and carbon. 

The period while the carbon is being oxidized, forming 
carbonic oxide, is called the " boiling " stage. The whole 
mass is then in a state of violent agitation, the slag being 
lifted up some distance above the bed, often flowing 
out at the door in a liquid state. The iron gradually 
comes to nature and is collected in balls as before, ready 
for the hammer. 

The slag from a puddling furnace is essentially a sili- 




68 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

cate of iron (2FeO, Si0 2 ), containing many of the impuri- 
ties originally present in the iron, and called "tap cinder." 
The puddling furnace (Fig. 24) is a reverberatory, with 
a low flat roof slanting from fireplace to flue. The fire 

bridge A and flue bridge 
B are formed of hollow 
iron castings encased in 
fire-brick, and the bed is 
likewise formed of iron 
plates rebatted together, 
rig. 24. The sides generally consist 

of hollow iron castings, which can be kept cool by the 
circulation of air through them. The laboratory part c 
is about 6 feet long and 4 feet wide, tapering to the flue 
bridge. The grate area varies from one-third to one-half 
that of the laboratory. The bed is lined with broken 
slags, hammer scale, and red oxide of iron, and the sides 
with bull dog, all being well rammed down. This is 
termed " fettling." The whole brickwork is cased with 
side plates of cast iron, united by flanges and bolts, 
and bound together across the top with wrought iron 
tie-rods. 

Treatment of puddled balls. The operations are 
conducted in that part of ironworks known as the 
" forge," which includes puddling, shingling, rolling, etc. 
The oldest class of hammers for shingling are the " tilt," 
where the axis is between the point of application of the 
cam and the head, and the " helve," or lift hammer, in 
which the hammer block and lifting cam are on the same 
side of the fulcrum. The former is used for light work, 
the latter for heavier work, such as shingling puddled 



RE-HEATING. 



69 



balls, blooming piles, etc. The modern form is the steam 
hammer, employed both for shingling and welding. 

Various forms of squeezers are also used instead of the 
hammer for the treatment of puddled balls. 

The rolling mill is generally used for merchant iron, 
the rolls being of two kinds " roughing " rolls and 
' finishing" rolls of several forms, according to the shape 
of the bar required. 

Re-heating. The shingled masses and bars of iron 
obtained from the forge contain slag and impurities 
which have not been eliminated in the previous opera- 
tions and the object of re-heating is to remove these sub- 
stances as much as possible. The bars are cut into short 
lengths, made into rectangular piles, bound together with 
a strip of iron and raised to a white heat. The enclosed 
slag liquates out as a fluid basic silicate (2FeO, Si0 2 ), 
leaving a basic residue mixed with black oxide of iron 
(Fe 3 4 ), which is further removed in rolling. The basic 
slag also acts on the manganese, silicon, phosphorus, etc. 
oxidizing them, the oxides passing into the fluid slag. 
The sulphur and 
carbon are also 
oxidized in the 
same way, and re- 
moved as gases. 

The re-heating 
furnace (Fig. 25) 
is somewhat similar in shape to the puddling furnace ; 
the bed is flat and slightly inclines to the flue and 
is lined with sand. In some works basic material is 
used. 




Fig. 25. 



70 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



For merchant bar, the iron bars are cut up, made into 
small bundles called fagoting, raised to a white heat, 
welded by the hammer, and rolled. This produces a 
stronger iron. If the operation is again repeated, the 
iron is still further improved, and called " treble " best. 

Of late years gas furnaces have been used for re-heat- 
ing, such as Siemens' furnace, Fig. 8. A modification of 
the regenerative furnace has been applied to re-heating by 
Ponsard. In this arrangement the gas from the producer 
is delivered directly to the furnace and burnt with hot 
air, heated by a "recuperator" placed under the bed of 
the furnace. The recuperator is a brick chamber, partly 
solid and partly hollow, containing a number of vertical 
passages, the adjacent ones being separated, and the 




?i j

alternate ones connected by horizontal passages in the 
perforated bricks. The flame passes downwards, while

71 



the cold air, admitted at the bottom, passes upwards by 
separate channels, the action being continuous. The 
whole arrangement is seen in Fig. 26. 

That part of the works containing the re-heating fur- 
naces, and the appliances connected therewith, is termed 
the " mill." 



CONVERSION OF PIG IRON INTO MALLEABLE IRON 
IN OPEN FIRES. 

South Wales finery. In South Wales and other 
places a superior quality of iron sheets for tin plates is 
made from pig iron in the " finery," 
or open fire (Fig. 27). The hearth 
is rectangular, and formed of cast 
iron plates lined with charcoal dust, 
the bottom being kept cool by a 
current of air. Three sides are verti- 
cal, while the remaining side slopes a 
little outwards. The fuel employed is 
charcoal, the fire being blown by a blast 
through a single twyer. The opera- 
tion is analogous to dry puddling. The 
charge of 2J to 3 cwts. of refined iron from a coke 
" refinery " (Fig. 23) produces a finery ball, weighing 
about 2 cwts., which is shingled and drawn out to a long 
bar, 2 inches thick, under a lever hammer. The bar 
is then nicked and broken into pieces, the best pieces 
selected, piled, and re-heated in the flame of a coke fire, 
in. a furnace similar to the finery, known as the " hollow 
fire," the upper part of which forms a chamber in which 




72 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

the piles are re-heated. The piles are then welded under 
the hammer and rolled into sheets. Before finishing, the 
sheets are pickled in sulphuric acid, and then rolled cold. 
Finery slag is highly basic, containing upwards of 75 per 
cent, of FeO. 

The Swedish-Lancashire finery is arched over at 
the top, and communicates with the chimney by a hori- 
zontal flue in which the pig iron undergoes a prelimi- 
nary heating 



STEEL. 73 



CHAPTER V. 

STEEL. 

EVERY malleable sample of iron containing sufficient 
carbon to enable it to be hardened is called " steel," 
the lowest carbon limit being '15 per cent. When the 
carbon exceeds 1*8 per cent, it forms cast iron. When 
the steel has been produced in the molten state and 
poured into an ingot, as in the Bessemer process, it is 
called " ingot " or cast steel; when produced in the solid 
state, as by puddling, it is called "wrought" or weld 
steel. 

Steel has a light bluish grey colour, which becomes 
whiter after hardening ; the lustre is similar to that of 
iron ; the fractured surface presents a fine uniformly 
granular texture, being very close grained when hard. 
Best steel has a higher tenacity than any other metal. 
It is hardened by making it red hot and plunging it 
into water, which slightly increases its volume. Hard 
steel is softened by making it red hot and cooling it 
slowly. The melting point is between that of cast iron 
and wrought iron, being lower the greater the amount of 
carbon it contains. When the amount of carbon is less 
than '4 per cent., it is known as mild or soft steel. 

Effect of impurities. '5 per cent, copper makes steel 



74 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

red short. Chromium gives whiteness and brilliancy to 
steel, but makes it harder and more brittle. Phosphorus 
is much more injurious in steel than in iron, and steel 
containing it can only be worked by keeping the carbon 
low. Manganese hardens iron like carbon, but in a less 
degree ; it also prevents the separation of carbon in the 
form of graphite, which is the opposite of silicon. 
Silicon hardens steel, makes it brittle and less tenacious. 
Sulphur has much the same effect, and makes steel red 
short. 

Steel is produced (1) by direct methods as in the 
Catalan forge ; (2) from pig iron in the finery ; (3) by 
puddling pig iron ; (4) by the cementation process ; (5) 
by melting raw steel in crucibles ; (6) by the pneumatic 
process as in the Bessemer vessel; (7) in the open 
hearth, as in Siemens' process. 

The method of making steel in the Catalan forge and 
Siemens' rotatory furnace has been already indicated. 

When a " finery " is used for making steel, the hearth 
is shallower than that used in making wrought iron, the 
twyer is fixed at a lower level and at a greater inclination, 
more fuel is used, and half as much more time required. 
The best varieties of iron for the purpose are strongly 
mottled pig iron and spiegel-eisen. The iron is purified 
by the oxidizing action of the blast and slag, and 
carburized by the charcoal used as fuel. 

Puddled steel is produced in muchHhe same way as 
iron, but greater care is exercised in selecting the pig 
irons used, those richest in carbon and manganese being 
preferred. A higher temperature is required than for 
iron, so as to form a thin slag, which covers the iron and 



CEMENTATION PROCESS. 



75 




retards the decarburization. The balling is clone at as 
low a temperature as possible, to prevent the carbon 
burning off. The mechanical treatment of the puddled 
balls is similar to that for iron. 

Cementation process. This consists of exposing bars 

of malleable iron in contact with , 

charcoal to a high and prolonged 
temperature in closed vessels, from 
which the air is excluded, in this 
way forming blister steel. The 
furnace (Fig. 28) is rectangular 
in plan, and covered with an arch, Fig. 28. 

having a hole in the centre 12 inches square, which is 
opened during cooling. It contains two rectangular 
fire-brick vessels, arranged one on each side the fireplace, 
which runs the whole length of the furnace. Each of 
these vessels is about 12 feet long and 3 feet square, but 
the sizes differ in different works. 

Swedish bar iron is preferred for making the best 
kinds of steel, and hammered bars are generally preferred 
to rolled bars. Ordinary sizes of bars are 2 to 5 inches 
wide, and f inch thick. The pots are charged by 
covering the bottom with coarse charcoal, and on this 
placing a row of iron bars, and so on alternately until the 
vessel is full. The top is then covered with " wheel swarf " 
from grindstones, which melts and forms a glaze when 
heated, thus excluding the air. The charge for one pot 
may be from 10 to 30 tons of iron. Two small holes are 
left in the furnace, corresponding to two similar holes in 
the vessels through which a bar from each vessel projects, 
called the trial bar. When the fire is lighted, two to three 



76 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



days are required to attain a proper temperature, which is 
then maintained for seven to nine days, according to the 
temper of steel required, the hardest steel requiring the 
longest time. On examining the trial bar from time to time 
the conversion is seen to have penetrated gradually to the 
centre, when the vessels are allowed six days to cool down. 
By cementation, the fibrous iron is changed to a finely 
granular steel, and the surface of each bar is covered 
with blisters, which in good steel are small and fairly 
regular. These blisters are probably due to the reduction 
of oxide of iron contained in the enclosed slag, and the 
evolution of carbonic oxide. If air has gained access to 
the bars during conversion, they are rough and have a 
skin of iron. When the temperature has been too high, 
and fusion on the surface has taken place, they are called 
"glazed " bars, both being unfit for making cast steel. 

Blister steel is used without further treatment for 
common purposes, but generally the bars are fagotted 
and welded one or more times, forming shear and double 
shear steel. The texture of the steel is modified accord- 
ingly as it has been rolled or hammered. The particles of 
rolled steel are somewhat spherical, such steel combining 
great elasticity with toughness. Hammered steel has a 
finer grain, a more compact structure, and a greater 
uniformity and density than rolled steel. 

Case hardening". This consists of the production of 
a surface coating of steel by a short cementation. Small 
articles may be case hardened by rubbing them when 
red hot in powdered yellow prussiate of potash (K 4 FeCy c ), 
and when the substance has volatilized, plunging them 
into water. 



OPEN HEARTH STEEL. 77 

Cast Steel. This was introduced by Huntsman in 
1740, who succeeded in melting blister steel in covered 
crucibles, and pouring the metal into moulds, thus 
obtaining a more homogeneous product than by hammer- 
ing or rolling. In 1801, Mushet introduced the method 
of making cast steel by melting malleable scrap iron with 
charcoal and black oxide of manganese (Mn0 2 ) in 
crucibles, which has since been largely practised. 

Indian or WootZ Steel is made by melting 1 Ib. ot 
malleable iron in a small crucible, with 10 per cent, of 
dried wood and 2 or 3 large leaves, producing a very 
hard steel. 

Open hearth Steel. This class of steel is made in 
the Siemens' type of gas furnace, known as the " open 
hearth," and the methods pursued may be classified under 
three heads (1) Pig and scrap process ; (2) pig and ore 
process ; (3) pig and blooms process. The first is due 
to Martin, the two last to Siemens, and known as the 
Martin and Siemens processes respectively. At the 
present time a combination of No. 1 and No. 2 is most 
commonly employed, and termed the Siemens-Martin 
process. 

The Martin process consists of melting malleable iron 
with pig iron, the latter with low silicon being preferable. 
The cast iron is melted in a separate furnace, and run 
into the furnace in the fluid state, then the malleable 
scrap (previously made red hot) is added. The oxide of 
iron (Fe 3 4 ) re-acts on the carbon and other elements of 
the cast iron producing gases which escape and agitate the 
molten metal, tending to make the iron uniform. When 
the refining is completed, spiegel-eisen or ferro-manganese 



78 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

is added, accordingly as hard or mild steel may be desired, 
and the metal tapped. 

In the Siemens-Martin process, the scrap iron is partly 
replaced by pure rich oxides of iron, which assist the 
atmosphere in oxidizing the impurities, thus hastening 
the process and rendering it less costly. The pig and 
scrap are added cold to the hot furnace, and when the 
ebullition due to the action of the scrap on the cast iron 
has nearly ceased, about 15 per cent, of ore is added. 
When the purification is complete, 8 to 12 per cent, of 
spiegel-eisen or ferro-manganese is added, and the metal 
tapped as before. 

In the third method mentioned above the balls or 
blooms are furnished by Siemens rotatory furnace or by 
the puddling furnace. These blooms act on the cast iron 
like the scrap and ore in the last process. 

In the ordinary Siemens furnace, the oxidizing action 
is feeble because of the siliceous nature of the slag; the 
removal of sulphur and phosphorus being almost nil. Of 
late years these elements have been largely removed by 
having a basic lining to the furnace, such as oxide of iron 
or dolomite, instead of the original sand lining. 

Pernot has modified the Siemens furnace by having a 
movable bed which inclines at an angle of 5 to 6 
degrees. The furnace (Fig. 29) is circular and cased 
with wrought iron, the roof being fixed. It is heated 
with gas in the usual way. The bed is lined with basic 
material rich in oxide of iron, and supported by a cen- 
tral spindle and conical friction rollers on a travelling 
carriage. By means of geared wheels it is slowly rotated, 
making three to four revolutions per minute during 



MALLEABLE CAST IRON. 



79 




charging and working. This rotation not only agitates 
the liquid metal, but favours the re-action of the basic 
lining on the cast iron. By this 
rotation and inclination of the 
bed, each half is alternately ex- 
posed to the flame, so that the 
bottom heat is constantly re- 
newed, and sticking of the 
charge prevented ; also the FeO 
of the fettling is oxidized to 
Fe 3 4 , which is brought under 
the liquid metal, and oxidizes Fig. 29. 

the impurities together with some of the iron. The 
charge consists of ith pig iron and th scrap wrought 
iron and steel. Spiegel-eisen or ferro-manganese is added 
at the end as usual. 

Ponsard adds a wind chest to the central spindle, 
which is hollow and communicates by a pipe with 
twyers fixed in the side of the furnace, so that an 
oxidizing blast may be injected as in the Bessemer 
process. The bed in this case only moves through half 
a revolution, otherwise the twyers would be alternately 
in and out of the metal. 

Malleable cast iron. The method of rendering 
cast iron articles malleable is effected by an oxidizing 
cementation ; haematite, lime, or other metallic oxides 
being used as the cement. The pig iron used for casting 
must be of a superior quality, charcoal iron being 
preferred. 

The castings are packed in chests with alternate 
layers, generally of Cumberland haematite. The tern- 



81 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

perature is raised gradually, and maintained at a red 
heat for one to three days, according to the softness 
desired; then allowed a few days to cool. The effect 
of the haematite is to oxidize the carbon of the pig 
iron. 

Steel casting. The great difficulty in casting steel 
is to avoid blowholes. A ladle of Bessemer or open 
hearth steel is a seething mass containing oxygen, and 
in this condition is unfit for castings. 

Various methods are employed to produce sound 
castings. A triple compound of iron, manganese, and 
silicon, is commonly used. The manganese and silicon 
reduce the Fe 2 3 , forming silicate of iron and man- 
ganese, which, being very fluid, liquates out from the 
solidified steel. 

Blowholes are believed to be due to the escape of 
hydrogen and carbonic oxide, the latter being formed by 
the re-action between the slag and carbon present, so 
that silicon and manganese by their superior oxidizability 
over carbon, prevent carbonic oxide being formed. Large 
castings require annealing in order to equalize the strain 
in all parts. 

BESSEMER PROCESS. 

This consists of blowing air through molten pig iron, 
without the aid of ordinary fuel, in a vessel called a 
converter, whereby the carbon, silicon, and some of the 
iron are oxidized, producing a very high temperature 
and leaving the iron commercially pure. 

Two distinct modes of working, employing totally 
different classes of pig iron are now adopted. In one 



BESSEMER PROCESS. 81 



the converter is lined with an acid material called 
ganister, and may be designated the "Acid" Bessemer 
process ; in the other, the vessel is lined with calcined 
dolomite, which is a basic material. This is called the 
" Basic " Bessemer process. In the acid process, the iron 
employed must be free from sulphur and phosphorus, as 
these elements cannot be removed from the iron, so that 
only the purer classes of pig iron can be used, such as those 
obtained from Cumberland hsematite. 

The converter is sometimes used fixed, as in Clapp- 
Grifnth's process, but more generally it is arranged so as 
to be moved through an angle of 180, thus enabling the 
metal and slag to be poured from the mouth. Figs. 
30 and 31 represent the most usual 
form of vessel ; it consists of a shell 
of wrought iron plates riveted to- 
gether, the neck being inclined at 
an angle of 30 to the body. The 
centre of the body is enclosed with a 
stout band of iron, upon which are 
fixed two arms, called trunnions, by ^ 
which the vessel is suspended on iron 
standards. One of the trunnions is ^s- so. 

hollow, through which the blast of air passes and thence 
through a pipe to the twyer box, which forms the 
movable bottom of the converter, and is kept in position 
by bolts and cotters. The bottom of the vessel is perfor- 
ated by 10 to 15 circular holes, into each of which is 
placed a conical fire-clay twyer 20 to 22 inches long, 
and perforated with 10 or 12 holes, each fth inch in 
diameter. The lining of the converter is of ganister, 

F 





82 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

9 to 12 inches thick, which contains 85 to 90 per cent, 
of silica. The ganister is coarsely ground, mixed with 

a little powdered fire- 
clay and water, then 

j; rammed in be . 

tween the iron shell 
and a central wooden 
core having the inter- 
nal form of the con- 
Fig- si. verter. The newest 
form of converter is concentric, the neck being straight, 
so that it may be charged or emptied from either 
side, which allows the wear of the lining to be equal- 
ized. 

The lining having been dried, the converter is made 
red hot by burning coke inside, which is then tipped 
out, and the vessel brought into the horizontal position. 
Molten pig iron is then run in from a cupola or rever- 
beratory melting furnace, in amount varying from 1J to 

10 tons, according to the size of the converter. It is then 
rotated into the vertical position, the blast being turned 
on so as to prevent the metal running through the 
twyer holes. For the first five minutes the flame is but 
slightly luminous, and but few sparks are emitted. 
During this period the graphite is converted into com- 
bined carbon, and the silicon is oxidized, forming a sili- 
cate of iron and manganese ; then the action gradually 
becomes very violent, the flame is brilliant, and showers 
of sparks, consisting of carbon, iron and slag are thrown 
out in consequence of the rapid ebullition, produced by 
the escape of carbonic oxide from all parts of the metal. 



BASIC PKOCESS. 83 



This lasts for seven or eight minutes, when the action 
diminishes. When the last trace of carbon is burned, the 
flame suddenly drops, and if the blast is continued, the iron 
itself burns. The converter is then brought to the hori- 
zontal position, and about 10 per cent, of spiegel-eisen, 
or an equivalent amount of ferro-manganese, is run in, 
or dropped in solid. The metal is then poured into the 
ladle, and from thence into ingot moulds. One blow 
lasts about twenty minutes. As iron, after decarburiza- 
tion in the Bessemer vessel always contains oxygen, the 
object of adding spiegel-eisen or ferro-manganese is to 
give sufficient manganese to combine with this oxygen 
and form a fusible slag with silica, and enough carbon to 
convert the iron into steel. The slag from the acid 
Bessemer process contains excess of silica and thus differs 
from tap cinder which is neutral or basic. 

Basic process. The application of a basic lining to 
the converter was introduced by Thomas and Gilchrist, 
thus enabling common pig iron, containing much phos- 
phorus, to be treated. The converter generally used in 
the basic process is shorter and wider than the acid-lined 
one. The lining consists of ground dolomite mixed with 
anhydrous tar as a cement. In the acid process, grey iron 
rich in silicon is necessary, while in the basic process 
white iron with less than 1 per cent, of silicon and 2 to 3 
per cent, of phosphorus is employed, the combustion of 
the latter furnishing the necessary temperature. The 
lining of the basic vessel is much sooner worn away, and 
the end of the operation more difficult to determine than 
in the acid-lined converter, so that samples have to be 
taken and tested, by their mode of fracture and the 



84 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

appearance of the grain. The operation in the basic 
vessel is conducted in the same way as in the acid 
process until the carbon is burnt off; then the blowing 
is continued to remove the phosphorus, which is called 
the "after blow." The spiegel-eisen is then added as 
before, and the metal tested. 



SILVER. So 



CHAPTEE VI. 
SILVER. 

SILVER is remarkable for its whiteness and brilliant 
lustre, although when precipitated from its solutions it 
often forms a grey powder ; it is harder than gold but 
softer than copper, the relative hardness being as 
4:5:7-2. Silver is extremely malleable and ductile, with 
a tenacity of about 14 tons per square inch; its specific 
gravity is 10-5, which may be slightly increased by 
coining, rolling, hammering, etc. ; it melts at about 
1000 C. ; is one of the best conductors of heat and 
electricity ; is volatile at high temperatures, and at the 
temperature of the electric arc may be boiled and 
distilled. When heated in a current of hydrogen it 
volatilizes at 1330 C. It does not oxidize when heated 
in air, but molten silver mechanically absorbs oxygen and 
emits it on solidifying ; this is called ''spitting." Silver in 
a finely divided state is oxidized when heated with certain 
metallic oxides, such as CuO, Mii0 2 , Pb 3 4 , etc., these 
bodies being reduced to lower oxides. Silver is soluble 
in nitric and sulphuric acids. Silver unites readily with 
sulphur when heated, forming silver sulphide (Ag. 2 S), 
which is a dark grey, crystalline body, with feeble lustre ; 
somewhat soft and malleable. When heated in air it does 



86 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

not form oxide or sulphate like most other metallic sul- 
phides and at a red heat is decomposed into metallic 
silver and sulphurous acid. If, however, silver sulphide 
mixed with copper or iron sulphide is roasted, then silver 
sulphate is formed, which is soluble in water. Dilute 
hydrochloric acid has no action on silver sulphide, but the 
strong acid attacks it. Lead, copper, or iron decompose 
it when the two bodies are fused together. When silver 
sulphide is heated with common salt, in the presence of 
moist air, silver chloride is formed. 

Silver, and all its salts dissolve in sodium hyposulphite, 
forming a soluble double hyposulphite (Na 2 S 2 3 , + 
Ag 2 S 2 3 ), when the sodium salt is in excess. Silver 
combines directly with chlorine to form silver chloride 
(AgCl). The same substance is formed by adding hydro- 
chloric acid or a solution of common salt to a solution 
containing silver, when AgCl is precipitated as a whit' 1 , 
powder; if, however, a large excess of strong salt solu- 
tion be used, the AgCl is dissolved, a double salt being 
formed thus : 

AgN0 3 + NaCl = AgCl + NaN0 3 
AgCl + NaCl = (AgCl, NaCl). 

Silver chloride fuses at a low red heat to a yellow liquid 
and readily volatilizes at a strong red heat. It is in- 
soluble in acids, but soluble in ammonia, sodium chloride, 
sodium hyposulphite, and potassium cyanide. It may 
be reduced by hydrogen, carbonate of soda, zinc, iron, 
and several other metals, and partially by sulphur. It 
unites with oxide of lead in all proportions, and partially 
so with sulphide of lead and some other sulphides. 



EXTRACTION OF SILVER. 87 

Alloys of silver. Silver forms valuable alloys with 
copper, but most of them undergo a partial liquation on 
cooling. When the copper is under 50 per cent, the 
alloys are white, but when above that amount, they have 
a red tint. The alloy containing 630*29 of silver per 1000 
is more fusible than silver or any alloy of silver and 
copper. Standard silver, used for the British coinage 
contains 9 2 -5 per cent, of silver, and 7*5 per cent, copper. 
Silver solders consist of silver and copper with a little 
brass ; sometimes bronze and arsenic are added. 

Ores of silver. Silver occurs native ; as sulphide in 
silver-glance ; as chloride in horn silver ; as bromide and 
iodide ; also in many lead, zinc and copper ores, and 
sometimes in iron pyrites. 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

Silver is extracted from its ores by both " Wet " and 
"Dry" methods, which maybe classified as follows 

1. Liquation; 2. Amalgamation; 3. Lead method; 
4. Wet methods. 

LIQUATION. 

Liquation is employed to separate silver from 
argentiferous copper by dissolving it in molten lead, 
and consists of three processes 1. Alloying with lead; 

2. Liquation proper; 3. Treatment of the residual copper 
arid the liquated lead. 

1. 100 Ibs. of copper, containing about 2 ounces of 
silver, is melted with 250 Ibs. of lead and poured into a 
casting pan, 2 ft. in diameter and 3J in. thick, forming 
a circular cake. 




88 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

2. A number of these cakes having been cast, they are 
placed on the liquation hearth (Fig. 32), which consists of 

two walls covered with 
iron plates inclining to- 
wards a median line, 
leaving a space of 2 to 
3 inches through which 
the liquated metal drops 
and runs along a gutter 
into a basin outside. 
The cakes are sur- 
rounded by an iron 

frame and packed round with charcoal to exclude air. 
A wood fire is then lighted underneath and the tempera- 
ture regulated by a damper in the back wall. In about 
an hour the lead begins to liquate out, carrying the silver 
with it ; when the flow ceases, the fire is allowed to die 
out. The residual copper contains about one third its 
weight of lead, with some silver j the liquated lead con- 
tains 2 to 3 per cent, of copper. 

3. The residual copper containing lead and silver is 
exposed to a prolonged high temperature in a hearth 
furnace provided with a twyer, by which means the 
lead and some copper are oxidized, leaving an impure 
copper which is afterwards refined. The liquated lead 
is treated by cupel) ation for the recovery of the silver. 
(See Chap. VIII.) 

AMALGAMATION. 

1. Patio or Mexican method. This process is em- 
ployed for the treatment of sulphides containing silver. 



AMALGAMATION PROCESS. 89 

The ore is first crushed by Cornish stamps worked by a 
water wheel, and then ground to a fine powder between 
two millstones called an arrastra, turned by mules. 

The finely ground ore is next transferred to the 
amalgamating floor or patio and left to thicken by 
evaporation of the water ; then salt earth, containing 
about 128 Ibs. of sodium chloride (NaCl) to the ton, 
is added, well mixed by shovels, and afterwards 
thoroughly incorporated by being trodden by horses, or 
mixed by a mechanical contrivance. The next day 
copper sulphate is added, then mercury, and the opera- 
tion of mixing continued until the whole of the mercury 
is taken up, when fresh mercury is introduced. One 
part of silver in the ore requires 6 parts of mercury to 
completely amalgamate it. 

The materials in the last operation form a mud which 
is transferred to circular stone vats and mixed with more 
mercury and water. The whole is then well agitated by 
means of a paddle turned by mules, water constantly flow- 
ing through, by which means the mercury and silver 
amalgam falls to the bottom, and the earthy matter is 
washed away. 

The excess of mercury is now removed by squeezing 
the amalgam in canvas bags and the amalgam taken to 
the " burning house." This contains an iron stand on 
which the compressed amalgam is placed, having a cistern 
below containing water, which is frequently changed. 
The whole is covered with an iron or copper bell heated 
externally by a fire ; the heat vapourizes the mercury, 
which condenses in the water below, leaving the silver 
on the stand. 



90 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



The changes occurring during the process may be 
briefly stated as follows : The salt converts the copper 
sulphate into cupric chloride, which in turn is acted on 
by mercury forming cuprous chloride ; these two chlorides 
of copper decompose silver sulphide, forming silver 
chloride, which is decomposed by mercury, liberating 
metallic silver, the latter being dissolved by mercury 
forming silver amalgam, thus : 



2NaCl + CuS0 4 = CuCl 2 4- 
2CuCl 2 + Hg 2 = Cu 2 Cl 2 + Hg 2 Cl 2 
2CuCl 2 + Ag 2 S = 2 AgCl -< Cu 2 Cl 2 + S 

l 2 + Ag 2 S + 30 = 2AgCl + CuCl 2 + 3CuO + S 



2. European method or Barrel amalgamation. 

This method is employed for sulphides, regulus, speise, 
and black copper containing silver, at Freiberg and other 
places. 

The ore is first ground and sifted, then roasted in a 
reverberatory furnace with 10 per cent, of common salt. 
Some of the sulphur and arsenic is expelled and the 
sulphides oxidized, first to sulphates then to chlorides. 
The roasted product is ground to a fine powder and 10 
to 14 cwts. put into an oaken barrel containing scrap 
iron, and partly filled with warm water. The barrel is 
then made to revolve, by which means the iron acts 
more perfectly on the silver and copper chlorides, reduc- 
ing them to the metallic state. After revolving two 
hours, 3 to 5 cwts. of mercury are added and the revolu- 
tion continued for eighteen to twenty hours. When the 
ores are very rich, scrap copper is used instead of iron. 



FREIBERG PROCESS. 




92 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



When the amalgamation is complete, the barrel is filled 
with water and slowly revolved for one and a half hours, 
the amalgam settling at the bottom. The amalgam is 
collected, washed, and strained through canvas, then 
pressed, and the mercury distilled off in an iron retort. 



EXTRACTION OF SILVER BY MEANS OF LEAD. 

Ores of copper, lead, nickel, cobalt, etc., and various 
residues containing silver are smelted with lead ores, if 

sufficient is not present 
with the silver, so as to 
concentrate the silver in 
the lead, which is after- 
wards separated by the 
Pattinson process, and by 
cupellation. The forego- 
ing scheme represents the 
method carried out at Frei- 
berg (see preceding page). 
The mixed ores in the 
state of powder are calcined 
and cintered to cause them 
to clot together, then smelt- 
ed with coke in the blast 
furnace (Fig. 34), called 
the Pilz furnace, from the 
Fi s- 34 - name of its inventor. The 

furnace is octagonal in plan. The hearth is surrounded 
with a hollow iron casing, through which water circulates 
to keep it cool. The throat is closed with a cup and 




AUGUSTIN'S METHOD. 93 

cylinder arrangement for charging and collecting the 
waste gases, which pass off by a side pipe and are utilized 
for heating the blast, boilers, etc. The operation being- 
completed, the charge is tapped into conical moulds, 
and forms three layers. Argentiferous and auriferous 
lead and copper at the bottom, then regulus containing 
a little silver, and on the top of this is the slag. When 
nickel, arsenic, and cobalt are present, a layer of speise 
is formed between the lead and the regulus. The regulus, 
speise and part of the slag are re-smelted with another 
charge. The lead is treated by liquation, then by the 
Pattinson process, then cupelled. The gold and silver 
alloy is treated with sulphuric acid which dissolves out 
the silver and leaves the gold. The silver in solution is 
precipitated with a solution of common salt, as chloride, 
and reduced by copper or zinc to the metallic state. 

WET METHODS. 

Two wet methods are in common use, named after 
their inventors Augustin and Ziervogel. 

AugUStin's method consists of roasting the ore 
with salt to form silver chloride, then dissolving the 
chloride in hot brine and precipitating the silver with 
copper. 

The ores, chiefly sulphides and other products, are 
first roasted to form oxides and expel volatile matter ; 
then roasted in a reverberatory furnace, at a low tem- 
perature, with common salt to form silver chloride. 

The roasted ore is next placed in a row of tubs (Fig. 
35) having false bottoms; the spaces between the false 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



and real bottoms are filled with layers of straw and 
cloth through which the liquid filters, and may be 




Fig. 35 a 



Fig. 35. 

drawn off by a tap opening into this space (Fig. 35 a), 
and the liquid run into a series of 
settling tubs placed below. About 
8 cwts. of hot roasted ore are put in 
each tub and on to this is delivered 
from a tank at a higher level a hot 
solution of common salt, which dis- 
solves the silver chloride, and running through the 
filter is tapped into settling tubs (B) for any solid 
matter to subside. The clear liquid is then run "into 
the next series of tubs below (c), which have false 
bottoms like the first, but containing also a layer of 
cement copper, 6 inches thick, which precipitates the 
silver, as shown by the following equation 

Cu + 2AgCl = CuCl 2 + Ag 2 . 
The copper passes into solution and any silver remain 



ZIERVOGEL'S METHOD. 95 



ing in solution is completely precipitated in the next 
row of tubs below (D). Lastly, the copper solution 
is run into a still lower series of tubs (E), when the 
copper in solution is recovered by precipitation with 
scrap iron, thus 

CuCl 2 t- Fe = FeCl 2 + Cu. 

The precipitated silver is collected and treated with 
hydrochloric acid to dissolve out any copper, and then 
refined. 

Ziervogel's method consists of roasting finely 
powdered silver sulphide, in admixture with copper pyrites, 
to silver sulphate, dissolving the sulphate in water, and 
precipitating the silver with copper. The perfection of 
the process depends on the preliminary roasting and 
the amount of copper and iron sulphides present. At 
Mansfeld, where the method was introduced, the ore 
contains about 80 per cent. Cu 2 S, 11 per cent. FeS 2 , 
and 0-4 per cent, of Ag 2 S. The iron and copper 
sulphides are decomposed, liberating the sulphur tri oxide, 
which in turn converts the Ag 2 S into silver sulphate 
(Ag 2 S0 4 ). 

The roasting process is performed in a double-bedded 
reverberatory furnace. The ore is placed on the top bed 
for a preliminary roasting, then raked on to the lower and 
hotter one to finish, with frequent stirring during the 
roasting. The operation requires about five and a half 
hours. When the roasting is complete, a portion treated 
with water should produce a light blue liquid, and a solu- 
tion of common salt added to this liquid should give a 
dense precipitate of silver chloride. If the silver and 



00 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

copper sulphates have been overheated, they will be 
reduced to metallic silver and oxide of copper, when a 
colourless liquid will be obtained by digesting a portion 
with water. 

The roasted mass is next put into tubs with false 
bottoms as in the Augustin method, in charges of 5 
cwts. each, and digested with hot water at 87 C., by 
which means the soluble copper and silver sulphides are 
dissolved. The liquid is then filtered, run into settling 
tubs, and thence to the precipitating tubs, where the 
silver is precipitated with cement copper as in Augustin's 
process. The residues, after extracting the silver, are 
smelted for black copper. About 1 2 to 1 4 Ibs. of silver 
are produced in twelve hours. 

ELECTRO-DEPOSITION. 

Silver is very extensively used for coating base metals 
in electroplating, the best solution for that purpose 
being the double cyanide of silver and potassium, which 
may be obtained either by the chemical or by the battery 
method. 

1. Chemical method. Dissolve 2 ounces of fine 
silver in dilute nitric acid ; evaporate to dryness on a sand 
bath ; re-dissolve in water, and add a strong solution of 
potassium cyanide, stirring all the time until the whole 
of the silver is precipitated; allow to settle; pour off 
the clear liquid and again add potassium cyanide until 
the precipitate just re-dissolves ; now add one fourth more 
to form the free cyanide, and make up the solution to 
one gallon. 




ELECTRO PLATING. 97 

2. Battery method. Make a solution of potassium 
cyanide containing 1J ounces to the gallon; suspend a 
large silver anode and small silver cathode in the solution, 
then send a current through the liquid until a piece of 
bright and clean brass receives a good deposit. 

Fig. 36 represents a silver plating vat with a copper- 
zinc battery attached. The silver plate A is connected 
with the positive ( + ) 
or copper plate of bat- 
tery and is called the 
"anode," or the part 
where the current enters 
the liquid; the article 
(B) to receive the de- 
posit is connected with the zinc or negative ( - ) plate 
of the battery and is called the " cathode," or the part 
where the current leaves the liquid. 

The work to receive a deposit must be scrupulously 
clean, for which purpose, it is generally boiled in a 
solution of potash to remove grease, then well swilled 
in clean water. In the case of copper, brass, or German 
silver the cleaned articles are dipped in a solution of 
mercury, by which the surface is coated with a film 
of that metal, which greatly aids the perfect de- 
position of the silver. Articles of zinc and iron are 
generally coated with a thin film of copper, in a copper 
cyanide solution, before immersing in the silver bath. 
Articles of tin, pewter and Britannia metal are taken 
from the potash solution to the silver solution without 
swilling in water, but for these metals a special silver 
solution is generally kept. 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



Silver may be stripped from old plated articles, with- 
out affecting the base metal, by using a mixture of 3 Ibs. 
of sulphuric acid diluted with 1 Ib. of water, and 1J 
ounces of nitre. 

GOLD. 

Gold is a yellow metal by reflected light, but green 
by transmitted light, with a brilliant lustre ; it exceeds all 
others with regard to malleability and ductility ; its 
specific gravity is 19 - 5; its melting point is about 1200 C.; 
it is almost as soft as lead, and can be welded together by 
pressure when cold ; and is one of the best conductors of 
heat and electricity. 

Gold does not oxidize in air, nor is it acted upon by 
any single acid except selenic, but is dissolved by 
chlorine or substances like aqua regia (N0 3 H + 2HC1) 
which yield chlorine. Chloride of gold (AuCl 3 ) is a 
deep red crystalline powder obtained by dissolving gold 
in aqua regia; it is soluble in water, and is used for 
preparing other gold salts. The metal may be reduced 
from a solution of the chloride by means of oxalic and 
sulphurous acids, by sulphate of iron, and by most metals. 
Sulphur does not combine with gold at any tempera- 
ture. 

Alloys Of gold. Pure gold is too soft for general 
use, so that it is usually alloyed with silver and copper, 
which harden it without seriously reducing its malle- 
ability. 

Fine gold is known by jewellers as 24 carat, and dif- 
ferent alloys as so many carats fine, thus 18 carat gold 
contains 18 parts gold, and 6 parts copper and silver. 



PUKE GOLD. 99 



The gold coinage of this country corresponds to 22 carat 
or 916-666 parts of gold and 83*334 parts of copper per 
thousand. 

The colour of gold is modified by the alloying 
metals 18 parts gold and 6 parts copper is reddish ; 
18 parts gold and 6 parts silver has a green tint; 
18 parts gold and 6 parts iron has a blue tint; 
and 12 parts gold with 12 parts silver forms a white 
alloy. 

In the case of gold solders, zinc is sometimes added to 
lower the fusing point. 

Gold and mercury unite in the cold, but much quicker 
when heated, to form amalgams, which may be liquid, 
pasty, or solid. 

Platinum is often present in gold, and does not seri- 
ously affect the malleability, but makes the colour paler. 

Malleable alloys of gold and tin may be formed, if the 
tin is pure, producing contraction, and having a specific 
gravity above the mean of the constituents. 

Antimony, arsenic, and lead are most injurious to gold 
even when present in minute traces. 

Pure gold may be obtained by dissolving 1 oz. of 
ordinary fine gold in aqua regia, evaporating the solu- 
tion to dryness, re-dissolving in water, and precipitating 
any platinum with potassium chloride. The solution is 
then diluted to a gallon, when any silver will, in the 
course of a few weeks, be precipitated as chloride. The 
clear liquid, after filtering, is then treated with sulphur- 
ous acid which precipitates the gold ; this, after washing 
with hydrochloric acid, water, ammonia, and finally 
with water, may be considered pure, and contains 999-6 



100 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

parts of gold per 1000. The precipitated gold is melted 
with hydrogen potassium sulphate and borax as fluxes. 

Ores of gold. Gold is usually found in the metallic 
state in nature (generally associated with silver and 
sometimes with copper, iron and platinum), in the state 
of grains in sand or alluvial deposits; in veins of quartz; 
and occasionally in lumps, which, when of notable size, 
are called nuggets. It is often found in other ores, such 
as galena, blende, iron and copper pyrites, etc. 

EXTRACTION OF GOLD FROM ITS ORES. 

Gold is extracted from its ores by means of mercury, 
lead, iron, or chlorine, with or without the aid of elec- 
tricity. 

1. Amalgamation with mercury. This method is 
mostly used for gold quartz and finely divided ores, such 
as gold sand. The ore is first crushed to powder, if neces- 
sary, with stamps, and roasted if sulphides and arsen- 
ides are present. The ore is then washed forward to 
the amalgamating mill with a stream of water. These 
amalgamators vary in shape, but the Hungarian Mill 
(Fig. 37) will illustrate the prin- 
ciple on which they are based. It 
consists of a cast iron basin fixed 
on a table, and passing through its 
centre is the driving shaft for a 
wooden muller, connected with it 
by two iron rods, and having iron 
ribs on its under surface. The mercury and ore mud 
occupy the space between this and the bottom of the 




P]XTRACTION OF GOLD. 101 



basin. The muller is 'hpl&w-ecTtnft on the top side to 
form a basin for admission of oh#. orS .vfhicyji .fyiiters the 
space at the centre. J A i'&men basin requires 50 Ibs. of 
mercury. 

A number of these mills are arranged in a train, so 
that any gold which escapes amalgamation in one may 
be retained by the succeeding ones. The union of the 
gold with mercury is greatly facilitated by the revolu- 
tion of the muller, which is actuated by the central 
spindle. The latter carries a spur wheel which gears 
with a similar wheel on the next mill. 

The amalgam is squeezed in bags to drain off excess of 
mercury, and the mercury distilled off in iron retorts, as 
with silver amalgam. 

Mr. Kowland Jordon, of London, has introduced an 
automatic arrangement for the amalgamation of gold 
ores without the use of fire or water. The ore is first 
roughly crushed, then passed to a fine crusher in which 
the ore is subjected to the alternating action of eight 
flat surfaces of hard iron arranged on two spindles, each 
revolving with great velocity and in opposite directions. 
A current of air is drawn into the chamber by means of 
vanes on the revolving arms, by which the ore, when 
reduced to powder, is carried forward to a settling 
chamber, and there falls by its own gravity to an appar- 
atus which automatically regulates the feeding -of the 
powder to the amalgamator. 

The amalgamator contains a layer of mercury 30 to 
50 inches deep, at the bottom of which, the ore powder 
is delivered, and being lighter than mercury, rises to the 
top. The gold is dissolved by the mercury and the 



102 , ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



sand is carried away t>y a,ii ai? current to the waste pit, 
or, if nec6ss?,ry, ;fce another machine. 
Electro amalgamation J of . gold ore. In the 

usual method for amalgamating gold ore, in which the 
crushed mineral is carried over mercury by a stream 
of water, it sometimes happens that the surface of the 
mercury becomes coated with oxides, sulphides, or 
arsenides, which necessitates a strong force of water to 
remove them, and causes loss of gold. Mercury con- 
taminated in this way is said to be "sick," and requires 
to be periodically distilled in order to purify it. 

Mr. Barker, F.G.S., has introduced a method of pre- 
venting this " sickening " of the mercury by connecting 
the mercury with the negative pole of a battery or 
dynamo, and the water flowing over it with the positive 
pole, so that the current flows from the water to the 
mercury; by this means any oxides, sulphides, etc., 
are decomposed, and the black scum retreats from 
the surface of the mercury as if driven by a blast of 
air. 

Electro deposition of gold. As already men- 
tioned, most metals and many salts deposit gold from 
its solutions, especially when made alkaline with car- 
bonate of potash, potassic cyanide, etc. The deposition 
is more perfect when a strong electric current from a 
battery or dynamo is sent through the liquid. 

The " Cassel " process consists of passing an electric 
current through a solution of common salt containing 
gold ore in suspension, by which the salt is decomposed, 
liberating chlorine ; this dissolves the gold, forming 
chloride of gold, which is then dissolved by the liquid, 



; 
GOLD PARTING. 103 



and subsequently decomposed, the gold being deposited 
at the cathode. 

The arrangement consists of a vat partly filled with 
a solution of common salt, and within this a barrel 
revolves containing the ore. This barrel is perforated 
with holes and covered with asbestos cloth. The interior 
of the barrel carries a number of carbon electrodes con- 
nected through the axis and a rubbing contact with the 
positive pole of a dynamo machine. The other pole of 
the dynamo is connected with a large copper plate 
placed in the outer vat, forming the cathode. By 
rotation of the barrel, the chlorine separated from the 
salt comes in contact with every particle of gold and 
dissolves it. To prevent the precipitation of gold in 
the barrel by iron salts, lime is added. 

Electro gilding. The preparation of a gold cyanide 
solution for gilding is very similar to that described for 
silver plating, but a stronger battery current is required 
and the solution is worked hot. 

SEPARATION OF GOLD FROM SILVER AND COPPER. 

Both wet and dry methods are employed. In the wet 
method either sulphuric acid or nitric acid may be used, 
the former being considered more economical on the large 
scale, but nitric acid is invariably used on the small scale, 
as in assaying. 

Sulphuric acid method. The alloy is made so as 
to contain not more than 35 per cent, of gold and 10 per 
cent, of copper, the rest being silver. It is then granu- 
lated by pouring into water, and placed in charges of 



104 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

3 to 5 cwts. in pots made of white cast iron, heated 
by a fire beneath. The silver and copper are dissolved, 
forming sulphates, and sulphurous acid escapes, which is 
conducted by leaden pipes into condensing chambers. 
The liquors are then siphoned off and the silver pre- 
cipitated by copper. The gold left behind still retains 
silver, and is boiled with fresh acid (sometimes in 
platinum vessels) to remove the last portions. The 
gold is then washed, dried and melted in plumbago 
crucibles with a little nitre and borax. The copper 
sulphate solution is concentrated and crystallized. 

Nitric acid method. The prepared alloy is boiled 
first with diluted ^acid, then with strong acid, in glass or 
platinum digesters. The liquors containing the silver 
are treated with copper or zinc to precipitate the silver, 
and the gold washed and melted as in the above 
method. 

Dry method by means of chlorine.- The gold 
alloy is melted in a clay crucible fitted with a lid. 
having a hole in the centre through which a clay pipe 
passes to the bottom of the metal for conveying the 
chlorine gas. The metal being melted, the surface is 
covered with borax, and the chlorine passed until 
orange coloured vapours appear, showing that all base 
metals and the silver have been chlorinized, and that 
the gold is beginning to be attacked. The contents are 
then allowed to cool, when the gold solidifies and the 
liquid chloride of silver may be poured off. This process 
is valuable when the amount of silver is small, bub when 
much silver is present, the wet methods of parting are 
preferable. 



EXTRACTION OF PLATINUM. 105 

PLATINUM. 

Platinum is a white metal, with a brilliant lustre ; 
highly malleable and ductile ; as soft as silver, and can 
readily be welded ; it is very tenacious, being only ex- 
ceeded by iron and copper among the elementary metals ; 
it only melts at the highest temperatures, such as those 
of the oxy-hydrogen flame and the electric arc. It 
does not oxidize at any temperature, and resists the 
action of all single acids, its best solvent being aqua regia. 
It is one of the heaviest metals, having a specific gravity 
of 21-5. Like silver it absorbs oxygen when melted, 
giving it out again on cooling, causing the mass to spit. 
It absorbs considerable quantities of hydrogen and other 
gases when heated, especially the spongy variety called 
platinum black ; if this substance be introduced into a 
mixture of oxygen and hydrogen it causes them to com- 
bine with the development of great heat. 

Platinum occurs in nature like gold, in the metallic 
state, in the form of grains or nuggets, often associated 
with iron, copper, gold, silver, and several rare metals. 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

1. Wet method. The ore is first washed and gold 
and silver separated by amalgamation. 2. The residue 
is next digested with boiling nitric acid to dissolve out 
all base metals, such as iron and copper. 3. It is then 
boiled with aqua regia, forming a solution of platinum 
chloride. 4. The solution is then evaporated to remove 
the acid; re-dissolved in water; mixed with an equal 



106 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

bulk of alcohol, and a solution of ammonium chloride 
added, which precipitates the platinum as a double 
chloride (2NH 4 C1, PtCl 4 ). 5. This chloride is washed, 
dried, and ignited in a plumbago crucible, when the 
platinum is left as a black powder. 6. The spongy 
mass is then welded by heat and pressure into the 
compact form. 

Dry method. Deville and Debray extract platinum 
by smelting the ore in a reverberatory furnace with 
galena or litharge, thus forming an alloy of lead and 
platinum, which is afterwards cupelled. The cupellation 
cannot be finished in an ordinary furnace in consequence 
of the high melting point of platinum, 
so that the refining is completed on the 
lime hearth of the oxy-hydrogen fur- 
nace (Fig. 38). This consists of two 
hollow blocks of lime placed together 
and bound with iron. The upper block 
Fig. 38. is perforated for the introduction of the 

blowpipes, one tube of each pair conveying coal gas and 
the other oxygen. The metal is placed in the cavity of 
the lower block, and 20 to 30 Ibs. may be refined in an 
hour. 

The spongy platinum obtained by the wet method is 
now melted and refined in this furnace, while, for the 
purpose of casting platinum into ingots, a crucible of gas 
coke is used in which the metal is placed ; this is enclosed 
in a lime crucible, and the whole heated in a lime furnace 
by means of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe flame. 

Electro deposition. There are two names given to 
the electro deposition of platinum platinizing and 




DEPOSITION OF PLATINUM. 107 

platinating. By the former is meant its deposition as a 
dark film, and by the latter its deposition as a white 
metal. Smee platinized sheets of silver for his battery, 
and various shades of colour are imparted to different 
parts of silver-plated goods by painting with solutions of 
platinum chloride of different strengths. 

A plating solution may be made by dissolving plat- 
inum chloride in potassium cyanide. The solution is 
used warm, with a moderately weak current. The anode 
does not dissolve, so that the solution must be periodi- 
cally replenished with fresh platinum salt.

CHAPTER VII. 

COPPER (Cu). 

COPPER has a red colour ; is highly malleable, ductile 
and tenacious ; melts at about 1 1 00 C. ; is not sensibly 
volatile except at very high temperatures ; its specific 
gravity is 8-96, which may be slightly increased by ham- 
mering and rolling. Copper is one of the best conductors 
of heat and electricity, but this property is considerably 
reduced by the presence of small traces of foreign sub- 
stances. It oxidizes at a red heat, and is soluble in acids, 
forming copper salts. The most common impurities in 
the commercial metal are iron, arsenic, silver and oxide 
of copper ; occasionally bismuth, tin, antimony, sulphur 
and lead ; and of these, arsenic and antimony are the 
most injurious. 

Copper forms two compounds with oxygen black or 
cupric oxide (CuO) and red or cuprous oxide (Cu 2 0). 
When copper is heated in air the red oxide is formed, 
coated on the outside with a thin scale of black oxide. 
When either of these oxides is heated with silica, a 
silicate of cuprous oxide is formed thus 
2CuO + Si0 2 = Cu 2 0,Si0 2 + 
Cu 2 + Si0 2 = Cu 2 0,Si0 2 . 

Cuprous oxide is soluble in molten copper, forming 



CHEMISTRY OF COPPER. 109 



dry or tmderpoled copper. When copper is exposed to 
air and moisture, it first oxidizes, then forms a green 
carbonate by the action of carbonic acid. 

Copper unites directly with sulphur when the two 
elements are heated together, forming cuprous sulphide 
(Cu 2 S). Also, when sulphide of iron and red oxide of 
copper are heated together a mutual exchange takes 
place, forming cuprous sulphide and oxide of iron, which, 
in presence of silica, forms silicate of iron. Cuprous 
sulphide is oxidized when heated in air or oxygen, and 
at a high temperature, with steam, thus 

Cu 2 S + 30 = Cu 2 + S0 2 
Cu 2 S+OH 2 = Cu 2 0-t SH 2 . 

When cuprous sulphide is heated with cuprous or 
cupric oxide or sulphate in suitable proportions, metallic 
copper is isolated thus Cu 2 S + 2Cu 2 = S0 2 + 6Cu. 
When cuprous sulphide is heated with iron, a double 
sulphide of iron and copper is formed, and some copper 
set free ; it is also partially decomposed by carbon. 

Copper and Carbon do not unite, but when com- 
mercial copper is heated with carbon, the oxygen it con- 
tains is removed and overpoled copper produced, which 
is red short. 

Copper and Phosphorus. These elements readily 
unite at a red heat, forming a hard, nearly white, brittle 
phosphide. Even in small quantities, phosphorus affects 
the physical properties of copper. Thus J per cent, 
makes copper harder, more tenacious, and more fusible. 



110 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

ORES OF COPPER. 

Native copper often occurs with other ores, and is 
sometimes covered with a crust of oxide and carbonate. 
The richest deposits of native copper occur on the shores 
of Lake Superior. Sometimes it occurs as grains in sand. 

Red oxide or cuprite (Cu 2 0) may contain 88-78 per 
cent, of copper and the black oxide (CuO) 79*82 per 
cent. Green carbonate or malachite (CuC0 3 + CuH 2 2 ) 
may contain 57 per cent, of copper and possesses 
a fine emerald green colour. Blue carbonate or 
azurite (2CuC0 3 + CuH 2 2 ) may contain 55-16 per 
cent, of copper. Copper pyrites, or yellow copper ore 
(Cu 2 S, Fe 2 S 3 ), is the most abundant British ore, and con- 
tains when pure 34-81 per cent, of copper. It may be 
distinguished from iron pyrites by its superior soft- 
ness. Vitreous, or grey sulphide of copper, copper-glance, 
redruthite (Cu 2 S) may contain 79-7 per cent, of copper. 
Fahlore, or grey copper ore, is a sulphide of copper where 
the copper is partly replaced by other metals, and often 
contains silver. Chrysocolla, a hydrated silicate of cop- 
per, and atacamite, a hydrated oxy-chloride, are some- 
times found. 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

There are four main processes of extracting copper 
1. Reverberatory method ; 2. Blast furnace method ; 3. 
Combination of 1 and 2 ; 4. Wet and electro-chemical 
methods. 

Welsh method. This may be explained by reference 
to the following scheme :

taining56to77%Cu 




112 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

1. Calcination with air. Volatile matter, such as 
arsenic, water, carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, etc., is 
expelled; some iron is oxidized, and the product con- 
tains iron copper, silicon, sulphur, oxygen, and earthy 
matter. 

2. Fusion for coarse metal. The charge consists of 
calcined ore, metal slag, and a little fluor-spar. The pro- 
ducts are a regulus of iron and copper, and an acid silicate, 
chiefly of iron (FeOSi0 2 ). If insufficient sulphur is pre- 
sent, some copper is reduced and the slag becomes too 
rich. Coarse metal is a bronze-coloured, stony-looking 
porous mass, and the slag is a dark-coloured brittle 
substance, often containing pieces of quartz and bits 
of coarse metal. 

3. Roasting of coarse metal. More sulphur escapes, 
iron is oxidized, and a black friable mass results. 

4. Fusion for blue, white, or pimple metal. The pro- 
duct of No. 3 is melted with roaster and refinery slags. 
and a certain proportion of oxidized ores, such as oxides 
and carbonates, which re-act on the regulus, the object be- 
ing to convert the whole of the iron sulphide into oxide, 
leaving the copper as sulphide. When the oxidized ore 
is insufficient, blue metal results, which contains sulphide 
of iron; when just sufficient, white metal, which is 
sulphide of copper, results ; when in excess, some of the 
sulphide of copper is reduced, and the surface of the 
metal has a number of pimples due to the escape of 
sulphurous acid. It is then termed pimple metal. 

Blue metal is a brittle substance with an uneven 
fracture, of a purplish blue colour when broken hot, 
and a bronzy tint when broken cold. It is often covered 



EXTRACTION OF COPPER. 113 

with fine strings of metallic copper called " moss " 
copper. 

White metal is compact, brittle, with an uneven 
granular or crystalline fracture and of a bluish grey 
colour. 

The slag is compact, brittle, with an uneven fracture, 
leaving sharp edges ; granular and sometimes crystalline, 
of a dark bluish grey colour, with bubbles on the surface. 
It is termed metal slag. 

5. Eoasting and fusion for blister copper. The pro- 
ducts of No. 4 are roasted so as to oxidize a portion of 
the copper sulphide, then melted, when the sulphide and 
oxide re-act, as shown in the following equation 



The surface of the ingot is covered with blisters which 
are due to the escape of S0 2 after the metal has 
solidified. The slag is sometimes light, porous, and of a 
black colour, sometimes dense and close, containing 
shots of copper, and of a reddish brown or black colour. 

6. Refining blister copper. The copper is quickly 
melted, and the metallic oxides present, together with much 
oxide of copper, combine with the silica to form a fusible 
slag. Such bodies as sulphur, antimony and arsenic 
are volatilized. The copper still retains some impurities 
and red oxide of copper. These are removed by cover- 
ing the metal with anthracite powder and inserting a 
pole of green wood which produces reducing gases, such as 
CO and CH 4 , which act chemically, in reducing oxide of 
copper, and mechanically, by bringing the impurities to 
the surface. If the poling is insufficient the copper is 

H 



114 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



dry in appearance, dull in lustre, and cracks at the edges 
when hammered, called "underpoled" or dry copper. 
When the right degree of poling is effected it is said to 
be at tough pitch. If the poling be carried too far, the 
copper loses its malleability and ductility. This is pro- 
bably due to the reduction of the oxides of foreign metals, 
such as lead and antimony, which alloy with the copper. 
Overpoling may be remedied by admitting a little air to 
the copper. An ingot of overpoled copper has a longi- 
tudinal ridge on its surface, and underpoled copper has 
a longitudinal depression, while tough copper has neither 
ridge nor furrow, but a level surface. 

Calciners. The furnaces employed for calcining 
copper ores have a long bed and comparatively small 
fireplace; the roof is low and contains two or more 
hoppers for charging, according to the size. An old 
form for calcining 3 or 4 tons is shown in Fig. 40. It 




Fig. 40. 

is lined with fire-brick, the bed being about 16 ft. long 
and 12 ft. wide. Several attempts have been made to 
utilize the sulphur given off during calcination. Mr. 
Spence invented a furnace for this purpose, 50 ft. long, 
heated from beneath, so that the furnace contains two 



EXTRACTION OF COPPER. 



115 



chambers an upper one in which the ore is placed 
and a lower one through which the products of com- 
bustion pass. The sulphur liberated from the ore in 
the form of S0 2 is utilized for the manufacture of 
sulphuric acid. The Gerstenhofer calciner (Fig. 41) is 
another arrangement for the same purpose. It is a 





Fig. 41. 



Fig. 4 1 a. 



rectangular chamber 20 feet high and 5 feet across, in 
which are arranged 20 rows of triangular fire-clay bars, 
2 ft. 6 in. long. The ore is ground fine, and the supply, 
regulated by feed rollers, passes through three narrow 
channels, and falls on the flat surface of the bars, then 
gradually descends as fresh ore is added, being oxidized 



116 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



in its descent, and is finally removed at the bottom. 
Air is admitted by a series of apertures in the front of 
the furnace and the combustion of the sulphur maintains 
the necessary temperature. 

Melting furnace. The melting furnace has a 
smaller bed and larger fireplace than the calciner. 




Fig. 42. 

Fig. 42 shows a section of an ore melting furnace. 
The bed or laboratory is an oval chamber, lined with 
sand and metal slag, 13 ft. x 9 ft., shaped hollow, and 
inclining from all parts to the tap hole. The fire-bridge 
is generally hollow to allow for the passage of air to 
keep it cool, and the roof is pierced with one opening 
communicating with the charging hopper. 



BLAST FURNACE METHOD. 

This plan is adopted where fuel is dear, the ores poor, 
refractory, and not too complex. The following method 
carried out in Sweden may be taken as a type. 

1 . The ore is roasted in heaps, 30 ft. square and 1 2 ft. 
high, or in stalls composed of three walls ; the burning 



EXTRACTION OF COPPER. 



117 



of the sulphur, together with some wood, maintains the 
heat. 

2. The calcined ore is then melted in the blast furnace 
(Fig. 43) with slags obtained from the black copper in 
No. 4. The furnace is 18 ft. high 3 

ft. 10 in. wide at the twyers, and the 
hearth 5 ft. 4 in. deep. In from two 
to three days the hearth is filled with 
regulus containing about 30 per cent, 
of copper, which is tapped into sand 
moulds. 

3. Roasting the regulus from No. 2 
called raw " matt." This is con- 



ducted in heaps, 1 1 ft. x 5 ft. x 5 ft. 
high, each heap containing about 5 
tons of matt, and requiring seven to 
eight weeks for completion. Fi - 43 - 

4. Smelting for black copper. The roasted regulus is 
rich in metallic oxides and requires a siliceous flux, such 
as ore slag. The charge consists of 2 

cwts. calcined regulus, 28 Ibs. of copper 
residues, 28 Ibs. of ore slag, 12 Ibs. of 
quartz and 18 Ibs. of charcoal. One 
operation lasts from two to three days, 
and the products are black copper con- 
taining about 94 per cent, of copper, a 
regulus containing 60 to 70 per cent, 
copper, and a slag composed chiefly of 
silicate of iron (FeO, Si0 2 ). The furnace 
is represented in Fig. 44. 

5. Refining black copper. The refining is conducted 





Fig. 44. 




118 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

in the blast hearth (Fig. 45), 2 ft. x 2 ft. diameter, and 15 
to 18 in. deep, lined with fire-clay 
and sand. The twyer inclines at 
an angle of 45. The copper is 
melted with charcoal by the aid of 
a blast of air, and the bath of metal 
kept covered with charcoal during 
refining. The slag is removed two 
Fig - 45< or three times and when it becomes 

red from the presence of oxide of copper the blast is 
turned off, the charcoal pushed back and the slag solidi- 
fied by projecting water on to the surface, and then 
removed as a cake. The copper is kept covered with 
charcoal until sufficiently refined or until the excess of 
cuprous oxide has been reduced by the carbon. 

Kernel roasting". This is an ancient process, 
formerly conducted in many parts of Europe and now 
carried out at Agordo in the Venetian Alps, the ore 
having an average composition of 2 per cent, of copper. 
It is a cupriferous iron pyrites and when roasted in 
lumps, 2 to 3 inches square, the copper becomes con- 
centrated in the centre, forming a nucleus consisting 
essentially of copper, iron, and sulphur, containing 4-5 
per cent, of copper. The outer shell consists chiefly of 
oxide of iron, with a little copper oxide and some 
copper sulphate, which latter is dissolved out with 
water. 

The calcination was conducted formerly in heaps but 
is now performed in kilns. The kiln (Fig. 46) is a 
rectangular chamber within four walls divided into sec- 
tions. The bed of each section is made in the form of a 



EXTRACTION OF COPPER, 119 

pyramid, on the top of which a chimney is roughly built 
with pieces of ore, and the spaces between are filled with

the ore to be roasted. The kernels obtained are smelted 
by the blast furnace method to obtain metallic copper. 

WET METHODS.

moisture, is converted into copper sulphate, which is 
dissolved by water, forming a solution from which the 
copper is precipitated by iron, thus 



One of the most successful methods is due to Hender- 
son and largely carried out by the Tharsis Company. 
The ore is first roasted to remove the greater part of the 
sulphur for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, leaving 
the iron as oxide, and the sulphur in about equal amount 
to that of the copper present. The ore contains 2 to 3 
per cent, copper and small quantities of silver and gold, 
which are recovered by the Claudet process. The mode 
of procedure may be explained by means of the following 
scheme (Fig. 47). 

1. The roasted ore is mixed with salt, ground, sifted

and roasted, forming copper chloride and sodium sul- 
phate, which are dissolved in acid liquors. 

CuS0 4 + 2NaCl = CuC) 2 + Na 2 S0 4 . 

2. The silver in solution is then precipitated by a solu- 
tion of zinc iodide, and the copper liquor siphoned off, 
leaving the silver iodide as a powder at the bottom. 

3. The copper chloride solution is run into vats, 
and the copper precipitated by means of scrap iron, 
CuCl 2 + Fe = FeCl 2 + Cu. The precipitate is washed, 
then melted and refined in reverberatory furnaces, as 
in the Welsh method. 

4. The silver iodide is washed and the silver displaced 
by means of zinc, whereby zinc iodide is reproduced. 
The chemical changes are shown by the following 
equations : 

2AgCl + ZnI 2 = 2 Agl + ZnCl, 
2AgI +Zn "= ZnI 2 + Ag.,/ 

Gold, if present, goes with the silver. 

ELECTROLYTIC EXTRACTION OF COPPER. 

In depositing copper by means of electricity it is 
necessary that the metal should be in solution, copper 
sulphate being generally employed. If copper regulus 
is to be treated, it is cast into flat slabs, rods of copper 
being placed in for supports and connections ; these slabs 
form the anodes in solutions of copper sulphate. The 
current is obtained from a dynamo machine. 

The impurities, especially arsenic, antimony, and bis- 
muth, introduce many difficulties in the way of successful 



122 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

working, and great experience is required to overcome 
them. The principle of the process rests on the fact that 
when the anode or solution contains several metals, the 
current makes a selection, and deposits them in a definite 
order. 

That metal will be first dissolved from the anode the 
solution of which causes the development of the greatest 
amount of energy, and that metal will be first deposited 
from solution the separation of which requires the least 
consumption of energy. Thus, suppose the following 
metals present in the anode Zinc, iron, tin, nickel, 
lead, arsenic, bismuth, antimony, copper, silver, and 
gold. All those which precede copper will be dissolved 
first, and those which follow copper will be dissolved 
last. When the above metals are in solution, the gold 
will be the first to be deposited and the zinc last. But 
this rule is dependent on the strength of current, nature 
of solution, whether acid or alkaline, and the proportions 
of the constituent metals. If the current exceeds a 
certain strength all may be dissolved and deposited 
together, and the more neutral the solution the more 
easily will the electro negative metals be dissolved, and 
the more easily will the electro positive metals be de- 
posited. If a copper anode contains a large amount of 
impurities these will be more readily dissolved than from 
copper containing only a small amount. The less dense 
and compact the anode is, the better will the process go 
on. 

The foregoing remarks apply to copper containing 
metals in the metallic form. If they are present as 
oxicles or sulphides, the former, being mostly non-con- 



ZINC. 123 



ductors, simply fall to the bottom of the vessel, the 
latter, being conductors, may be dissolved and the metal 
deposited ; but if there is much copper in the anode and 
little sulphide, the latter falls to the bottom and the 
copper only is deposited. 

Electro deposited copper, from a copper chloride or 
sulphate solution, is remarkably pure, for silver and 
gold, when present, are precipitated from the solution ; 
lead forms an insoluble sulphate ; iron, zinc, and tin are 
too electro positive to be deposited at the same time as 
copper, and the same applies to nickel, although in a 
less degree. The greatest danger is with antimony, 
when that metal is present in solution with the copper. 

Copper plating. For coating articles of brass and 
German silver with copper, a solution of copper sulphate 
is employed ; but articles of zinc, iron, tin, and lead 
require a copper cyanide solution. 

ZINC (Zn). 

Zinc is known in commerce under two names in the 
cast state as " spelter," and when rolled into sheets, etc., 
as zinc. It is a white, highly crystalline metal, with, a 
bluish shade and bright metallic lustre ; when pure, it is 
malleable at the ordinary temperature, while commercial 
cast zinc is brittle; it becomes malleable and ductile 
however, if heated to a temperature of 100 to 150 C., 
but beyond that point it again becomes brittle. The 
specific gravity in the cast state is 6-86, which may be 
increased to 7*21 by rolling or forging; it contracts but 
slightly on cooling from the liquid state and thus forms 



124 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

good castings; it melts at 430 C., and boils at 1040 C. 
At a red heat in air it rapidly oxidizes and burns with a 
greenish white flame forming zinc oxide (ZnO) ; raised 
to a bright red heat in a closed vessel, it may be readily 
distilled. When rolled zinc is exposed to air and 
moisture a grey film of suboxide is formed, which pre- 
serves the metal from further oxidation. Ordinary zinc 
readily dissolves in dilute hydrochloric and sulphuric 
acids, while the pure metal is unaffected; both kinds 
dissolve in nitric acid and in alkalies. Zinc displaces 
silver, gold, platinum, bismuth, antimony, tin, mercury, 
and lead from their solutions. The chief impurities of 
the commercial metal are iron, lead, and arsenic. 

Zinc and sulphur do not readily unite, but when a 
mixture of finely divided zinc and sulphur is projected 
into a red-hot crucible, some zinc sulphide is formed. It 
is also formed by heating zinc with cinnabar. 

Zinc forms compounds with phosphorus and arsenic 
when these bodies are heated together, having a metallic 
lustre and somewhat vitreous fracture. 

The chief ores of zinc are : The oxide (ZnO) called 
zincite or red oxide of zinc, which is white when pure, 
but generally red from the presence of oxide of man- 
ganese ; the sulphide (ZnS) known as "blende" and 
" black jack," which is the principal source of the metal, 
and generally black or yellowish black in colour, but 
sometimes it has a reddish tint from the presence of 
galena; when pure it is white and contains 67 '03 per 
cent, of zinc ; the carbonate (ZnC0 3 ), called calamine ; 
and the silicate (2ZnO, Si0 2 , OH 2 ), called electric calamine. 



EXTRACTION OF ZINC. 125 

MODES or EXTRACTING ZINC. 

In consequence of the volatile character of zinc it is 
always extracted by distillation at about 1000 C. 
Blende being the chief ore is most commonly employed, 
and is first converted into oxide, then reduced by carbon 
and carbonic oxide, the latter probably playing the most 
conspicuous part. It may also be reduced by hydrogen 
and hydrocarbons, and as all these agents are present in 
the products of decomposition of the coal employed, each 
helps in effecting the isolation of the metal. Sulphide of 
zinc may also be reduced when heated in suitable propor- 
tion with oxide of zinc, thus ZnS + 2ZnO = S0 2 + 3Zn. 
It is also reduced by iron. 

The roasting of the powdered blende is performed in 
a reverberatory furnace until the ore is " sweet," that is, 
until no more sulphur can be driven off, and the zinc is 
almost entirely in the form of oxide. 

The distillation is conducted in closed fire-clay retorts 
connected with a cool receptacle, in which the zinc 
vapours are condensed. The re-actions occurring in the 
above operations may be represented thus : 

ZnS + 30 = SO., + ZnO. 
ZnO+ C =CO~+Zn. 
ZnO+ C0-C0 2 + Zn. 

In the last equation we see that CO 2 is formed, which, 
being an oxidizing agent, will oxidize metallic zinc, thus 
acting in opposition to CO, so that a large excess of CO 
must be present to counteract this neutralizing agency 
When the two oxides of carbon are present in the pro-

portion of 28 : 44 no reduction can occur, as shown in 
the following equations : 

ZnO + CO = Zn + CCX,. 
Zn -i C0 2 = ZnO + CO~ 

The furnaces employed for 
distilling zinc are of three 
kinds, viz., the Old English 
the Belgian, and the Silesian. 
The Old English fur- 
nace (Fig. 48) is a furnace 
of the "gallery" type, in 
which a row of fire-clay cru- 
cibles is placed on each side 
of a central fireplace. Each pot is 4 feet high, 2 feet 
6 inches wide at top, closed with a lid, 
and perforated with a hole at the bot- 
tom, into which fits a condensing pipe 
for conveying the distilled metal into 
an iron receiver at the bottom. 

The Belgian furnace (Fig. 49) 
contains a vertical arched chamber in 
which are placed several rows of 
cylindrical fire-clay retorts (a) 3 feet 
6 inches long and 8 inches in diameter, 
outside measure, the fireplace being 
below. Each retort is fitted with a 
simple bellied fire-clay nozzle (b) 12 
inches long, in which the zinc for the 
most part condenses, and to the front 
Fig. 49. O f this is attached a sheet-iron tube 

(c) for condensing the "fume," which is a mixture of

zinc oxide and finely divided zinc. The calcined blende 
is ground to powder, mixed with half its weight of 
small coal or coke, and about 25 Ibs. of the mixture 
introduced into each retort, when the condensing 
tubes are luted on. Each furnace contains about sixty 
retorts, treating about 1 ton of ore in twenty-four hours, 
and yielding 30 to 40 per cent, of zinc. The crude zinc 
obtained from every mode of distillation requires to be 
re-melted, when zinc oxide and other impurities rise to 
the surface as dross. The metal is then cast into ingots 
weighing 70 to 80 Ibs. each. 

The Silesian furnace (Fig. 50) is a "gallery" 
furnace, containing two rows of Q -shaped muffles closed 
at one end, each 3 feet 
long and 8 inches wide, 
made of fire-clay, with 
the fireplace between. 
The upper part of the 
outer end of each muffle 
opens into an elbow- 
shaped clay nozzle, 
which connects with 
an iron pipe leading into a condensing chamber. The 
charge for each muffle is about 1 00 Ibs. 

Instead of the condensing arrangement just described 
the Belgian system of condensation is now generally 
adopted. Zinc muffles and retorts are now largely 
heated with gas using hot air, heated either on 
Siemens', Boetius', or Ponsard's principle. (See Figs. 
7, 8 and 26.)

an electrolytic method for the deposition of zinc. The 
blende is roasted at a low temperature, by which means 
the sulphide is largely converted into sulphate, thus 



The product is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, placed 
in vats with a plate of carbon as the anode, and a plate 
of zinc as the cathode, the current being supplied by a 
dynamo machine. 

Alloys of zinc. The most important alloys of zinc 
are those with copper called "brass." These metals 
mix together in all proportions forming alloys of various 
shades of colour between red and white, the purest yellow 
being found in those containing 75 to 80 per cent, copper. 
The term brass is generally applied to those having 
a yellow colour, although it is sometimes used for all 
alloys of copper and zinc. In many cases different 
names are used to express the same substance. Ordi- 
nary brass is harder than copper ; highly malleable and 
ductile ; is well adapted for castings ; melts at a lower 
temperature than copper, and is capable of taking a 
high polish. Occasionally small quantities of other 
metals are added. The following is the composition 
of various zinc alloys: Tombec, 84 Cu and 16 Zn ; 
Prince's metal, 83 Cu and 17 Zn; gilding metal, 80 Cu, 
18 Zn and 2 Sn ; Bath metal, 78 Cu and 22 Zn ; Mosaic 
gold, pinchbeck, etc., 75 Cu and 25 Zn; brass, 66J Cu 
and 33 Zn; brass for turning, 66 \ Cu, 32 Zn and 1J 
Pb ; white brass, 33J Cu and 66J Zn. Aich's, sterro, 
Gedge's and delta metal contain iron in addition to 
copper and zinc. 



BRASS. 129 



The formation of alloys of copper and zinc, according 
to Riche, is attended with contraction, which is a 
maximum in the alloys Zn 3 Cu 2 and Zn 2 Cu. These 
alloys are brittle and do not exhibit any of the physical 
properties of the constituent metals. The density of 
brass is increased by mechanical treatment, but this is 
partly annulled by heating and slow cooling. Pinchbeck 
is not altered in density either by working, or by slow or 
rapid cooling after heating. 

Brass soon tarnishes when exposed to the air, and by 
continual vibration or stress a crystalline structure is 
induced which makes it brittle. 

Brass is prepared by melting the copper in a black- 
lead crucible, or on the bed of a reverberatory furnace, 
and then cautiously adding the necessary quantity of zinc. 
In practice a certain amount of scrap brass to the extent 
of about one third the charge is added. A little lead is 
added to brass required for turning and rolling. 

Galvanized iron is iron plate and iron articles coated 
with zinc to prevent the iron from rusting. The zinc 
was originally deposited by means of an electric current. 
It is now performed by dipping the clean iron into a 
bath of molten zinc, the surface of which is covered 
with sal-ammoniac in order to prevent oxidation, and 
at the same time to dissolve any oxide that may be 
formed. After a bath of zinc has been worked some 
time, an alloy of iron and zinc is formed which is 
duller than zinc, with a somewhat scaly appearance on its 
fractured surface, which is also covered with a number 
of grey or black specks. The zinc may be largely 
recovered from this alloy by distillation.

CHAPTEK VIII. 
LEAD (Pb). 

LEAD has a bluish grey colour and considerable lustre 
when freshly cut; it is malleable, ductile, and tough, 
but has feeble tenacity. Pure lead emits a dull sound 
when struck, but the presence of impurities renders it 
more sonorous; it melts at 330 C. and contracts on 
cooling ; its specific gravity is 1 1 '44. It is so soft that 
it can be cut into slices with a knife, or squirted into 
the form of tubes or rods, and two pieces can be 
welded together by pressure in the cold. Sheets of 
lead and tin can be rolled into one compact sheet, called 
"autogenous soldering." It oxidizes in moist air, and 
is insoluble in ordinary sulphuric acid, so that lead 
chambers are employed in the manufacture of that acid. 
It is volatile when heated in air, forming lead oxide 
(PbO). 

Oxide of lead or plumbic oxide (PbO) is yellow and 
exists both in the amorphous and crystalline states. 
The former, called massicot, is formed when molten lead 
is exposed to air or oxygen below a red heat, the latter, 
called litharge, is of a deeper colour and formed when 
the oxide has been fused, which occurs at a red heat. 
PbO is reduced by carbon, hydrogen, and the ordinary 



CHEMISTRY OF LEAD. 131 

reducing agents; it also unites with many oxides and 
renders them readily fusible, but different oxides require 
different amounts to effect this fusion. Cuprous oxide 
(Cu 2 0) requires 1 part ; ferric oxide (Fe 2 3 ) 4 parts ; zinc 
oxide (ZnO) 8 parts ; and tin oxide (Sn0 2 ) 1 2 parts. It 
acts as an oxidizing agent on many metals, such as cop- 
per, zinc, iron, etc., itself being reduced. 

When massicot is heated to about 300 C. it takes up 
oxygen forming red lead (Pb 3 4 ), thus 

3PbO + --= Pb 3 4 . 

The oxides of lead are reduced by hydrogen, carbon, and 
carbonic oxide. 

Lead and sulphur unite when heated together to form 
lead sulphide (PbS), which is a bluish grey, brittle, and 
crystalline body, melting at a strong red heat. When 
roasted in air at a low temperature it is oxidized to 
sulphate (PbS0 4 ), but at a higher temperature it is con- 
verted into oxide (PbO), thus 

PbS + 40 = PbS0 4 
PbS + 30 = PbO + S0 2 . 

If lumps of lead sulphide about the size of peas be 
roasted in air, the outer layers will be oxidized and an 
inner nucleus of unaltered sulphide will remain. If 
such a mass be fused, the oxide, sulphate and sulphide 
re-act on each other, liberating metallic lead, thus 



PbS + PbS0 4 o Pb 2 + 2S0 2 
PbS + 2PbO = 3Pb + S0 2 . 

Sulphide and sulphate of lead are most readily reduced 



132 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



by fusion with iron, forming sulphide of iron (which floats 
as a regulus on the top), and metallic lead, thus 

PbS + Fe = FeS + Pb. 

The same effect is produced by oxide of iron and carbon 
instead of iron. When heated with carbon or carbonate 
of soda alone, only a partial reduction of the lead sulphide 
takes place. 

Alloys of lead. For type metal and Britannia metal 
see "Antimony," and for fusible alloy see "Bismuth." Shot 
metal is lead containing 40 Ibs. of arsenic per ton, which 
causes the small fragments of molten metal to assume 
the globular form in falling from a height. Pewter 
contains about 80 parts tin and 20 of lead ; but other 
metals are often added in small quantity, such as copper, 
antimon}' and zinc. Soft solder contains varying pro- 
portions of lead and tin, the best quality being that 
which contains most tin. Lead and zinc may be melted 
together in all proportions, but they separate to a great 
extent on cooling; if silver be present, the zinc which 
solidifies as a crust on the surface will contain the silver 
and a little of the lead. This is the basis of Parkes' pro- 
cess for desilverizing lead. Silver and lead alloy together 
in all proportions, but a certain amount of liquation 
takes place on cooling, whereby the outer portions of 
the alloy are much poorer in silver than the inner 
core ; also if such an alloy be allowed to cool slowly 
and constantly stirred, the rich portion remains liquid 
after the other has solidified. This is the basis of 
the Pattinson process for desilverizing lead. Lead 
readily dissolves gold when melted with it, and is

used for the extraction of both gold and silver from 
their ores and products. 

Ores of lead. Galena (PbS) is by far the most 
abundant ore of lead and is the chief source of the 
metal. It is a lead-grey mineral with a metallic lustre 
and gives a lead-grey streak ; it is generally found 
crystallized in cubes and has a specific gravity of about 
7-6. It always contains some silver. Cerusite (PbC0 3 ) 
occurs sometimes in needle-shaped crystals, and some- 
times massive. It is white when pure, but often has a 
dirty white or reddish colour and gives a white streak. 
Pyromorphite (3Pb 3 P 2 8 + PbCl 2 ) is generally green in 
colour, but sometimes yellow or brown, and gives a 
white streak. Mimetesite resembles pyromorphite but 
contains arsenic instead of phosphorus. Anglesite 
(PbS0 4 ) is generally white or grey in colour. 

Extraction of silver from lead." Pattinson's pro- 
cess," the principle of which has already been mentioned, 
is conducted in a series of 9 to 15 pots (Fig, 51), each 




Fig. 51. 

capable of holding from 3 to 7 tons of lead, and some- 
times 15 tons, each heated by a separate fire. Suppose 3 
tons of lead, containing 10 ounces of silver per ton, are 
first melted in the middle pot of the series, say No. 
8, it is then well stirred, skimmed, and allowed to 
cool. At a certain temperature the poor lead separates 



134 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

in crystals which are removed as they form by a per- 
forated ladle and transferred to the next pot on the 
right, No. 9, leaving a rich liquid argentiferous lead 
in the pot, which, when the operation has been carried 
sufficiently far, is conveyed to the next pot on the 
left, No. 7. This will contain 1 ton of the enriched 
lead, while No. 9 will contain 2 tons of the impoverished 
lead. Each pot is then made up to 3 tons with lead 
containing the same amount of silver as that transferred 
to the respective pots, so that the same quantity of 
metal is operated upon in each case. The operation 
of melting, skimming and cooling, with constant stirring, 
is repeated in Nos. 9 and 7, when the lead is further 
enriched in the latter and impoverished in the former, 
so that when the portion travelling to the right reaches 
No. 15 pot it is nearly free from silver, while, when the 
portion which is transferred in the opposite direction 
reaches No. 1, it probably contains 250 ounces of silver 
per ton ; but it may be concentrated to contain 700 
ounces, beyond which it is not practicable to go. 

" Parkes' process " depends on the superior affinity of 
silver for zinc over lead. The argentiferous lead is 
melted in an iron pot, raised to the melting point of 
zinc, skimmed, 1 to 2 per cent, of molten zinc added 
and the whole constantly stirred, while the temperature 
is gradually lowered until the zinc separates as a crust 
on the surface. These crusts, containing silver and 
some lead, are removed until an assay shows that the 
remaining lead is sufficiently low in silver. They are 
next heated to a little above the melting point of lead 
in a cylindrical retort open at the front, and inclining

135 



from back to front, when the lead liquates out, carrying 
much of the silver and a little zinc with it. The un- 
nielted residue is then heated with lime and coal in a 
closed retort by which the zinc is distilled, leaving a 
mass of silver, lead, copper, etc., behind. The rich lead 
obtained by Parkes' or Pattinsori's methods is treated by 
cupellation for the separation of the silver. 

The desilverizing of lead is said to be facilitated by 
passing a voltaic current by means of copper wires 
through argentiferous lead containing a little zinc, until 
all the zinc has risen to the surface. 

Cupellation. This is a method for the separation of 
base metals as oxides in conjunction with oxide of lead, 
from silver and gold, which do not oxidize. Two 
methods are employed, known respectively as the Ger- 
man and the English. 




Fig. 52. 

The "German hearth" (Fig. 52) is of the revej- 
beratory type, but without a chimney, the volatile 
products escaping through an opening opposite the 
bridge. The bed, which is circular and concave and 
about 10 feet in diameter, is made of marl, which is 
chiefly composed of carbonate of lime, carbonate of

magnesia and clay. The roof is formed of a movable 
iron cover lined with clay ; the air is supplied by a pair 
of inclined twyers fixed in one side of the bed and the 
oxide of lead flows off through an opening opposite the 
twyers. When the lead is melted by means of a wood 
or coal fire, the blast is continued until the surface 
brightens, showing that the silver is comparatively pure 
and free from oxide. Water is then thrown on the fire 
and on the bath of silver, which soon solidifies. The 
silver thus obtained is further purified by melting in a 
small reverberatory furnace similar to the above, or in a 
plumbago crucible. 




Fig. 53 

The "English process" is conducted in a reverberatory 
type of furnace (Fig. 53), with a 
movable bed made of bone ash, 
called a "test." This is an oval 
frame of wrought iron (Fig. 54), 
about 5 feet long and 3 feet wide, 
well lined with moistened bone ash 
mixed with a little pearl ash, 1 inch 
- 54< thick, leaving a cavity which in- 

clines from the sides to the centre, on which the metal is

afterwards melted and refined. The breast of this test 
is perforated with a number of holes for the removal 
of litharge as it forms. Some tests are kept in stock, as 
several weeks are required to gradually and thoroughly 
dry them after making. Bone ash differs from marl in 
that it absorbs a considerable portion of the litharge 
formed during cupellation. 



PROCESSES FOR THE EXTRACTION OF LEAD. 

The various processes for extracting lead may be 
divided into three groups 1. By roasting and re-action. 
2. By roasting and reduction with carbon. 3. By direct 
reduction with iron or bodies containing iron. 

1. Methods by roasting and re-action. These 
are carried out in reverberatory furnaces of which the 
Flintshire furnace (Fig. 55) may be taken as a type. 




Fig. 55 



The roof is low and inclines from fireplace to flue and 
contains in the middle a hopper for charging. Three 
working doors are arranged on each side, the front ones 
being used for rabbling the charge and the back ones for 



138 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

tapping the slag. The bed, which is lined with lead slag, 
is made to slope from all parts towards a depression called 
the well, in front of tap hole, which is placed under the 
middle door on the front side; in this well the metal 
collects before tapping. 

The process is conducted in four stages 1. roasting; 
2. reduction; 3. stiffening with lime; 4. tapping out 
the lead and removing the grey slag. 

About 1 ton of galena is charged through the hopper 
and roasted for two hours on the raised part of the bed 
at a temperature below its melting point, with constant 
stirring to prevent clotting. Sulphurous acid is liber- 
ated and a mixture of sulphide, oxide and sulphate 
of lead remains. Then the fire is made up and the 
temperature raised until the charge melts ; the re-action 
between the sulphide and oxides now takes place with 
the separation of metallic lead, which collects in the 
well. The mixture of slag and undecomposed ore is 
then stiffened by mixing with lime (called "setting up"); 
roasted again for an hour and then melted, by which 
means a further separation of lead is effected. The metal 
is now tapped into a pot outside heated by a separate 
fire, and the lead covered with fine coal. It is then well 
stirred, skimmed and the metal cast into moulds. The 
" grey slag " is withdrawn in pasty lumps through the 
back doors of the furnace. The whole operation of 
working off a charge lasts about five or six hours. 

The "Brittany furnace" is smaller than the Flintshire, 
having three doors along one side only. The ore smelted 
is galena, with 12 to 18 per cent, of iron pyrites, and the 
method pursued is similar to that in North Wales. The 



EXTRACTION OF LEAD. 139 

lead obtained is purified by stirring with a pole of green 
wood as in copper refining. 

In Spain a reverberatory furnace is employed for 
smelting rich galena by the method of roasting and re- 
action, but a kind of blank furnace is placed between 
the reduction chamber and the stack for the better con- 
trol of the draught. Also the stiffening is made with 
charcoal instead of lime. In other respects it resembles 
the Flintshire method. 

The " Cornish method," which is carried out in Corn- 
wall and some continental works, is employed for the 
treatment of an impure galena containing blende, iron 
ore, fahlerz, quartz, fluor-spar, etc. 

The reduction is effected partly by the principle of re- 
action and partly by iron and carbon, so that three 
products are obtained lead, regulus which is again 
treated for lead, and slag. The ore, from 1J to 3 tons, 
is calcined in a separate furnace, then introduced into a 
furnace similar to the Flintshire furnace for reduction, 
and called the "flowing" furnace. A considerable 
quantity of lead separates by the re-action of the sul- 
phide and oxides and is then tapped out. The residue 
is then mixed with anthracite and iron and the tempera- 
ture raised, when a further reduction takes place yielding 
lead, regulus and slag. One operation in the flowing 
furnace takes seven to eight hours. 

Method by roasting and reduction by carbon. 
In the north of England, a small blast furnace is 
employed for lead smelting called the " ore hearth "

2 feet x 1 foot x 2 feet deep, lined with cast iron

plates, and closed by an arched hood for taking away 
the fumes. In the back wall is fixed a twyer for intro- 

ducing a blast of air. In 
front is an inclined work 
stone (b) with gutters for the 
lead to flow into the pot (a) 
placed in front of the work 
stone. 

Peat, which is used as the 
Fi g- 56 - fuel, is first charged into the 

hot hearth and the blast turned on. Then a little 
coal is added, and then the ore, which was formerly 
added in the raw state, but is now first roasted in 
a reverberatory furnace. In half an hour the lead 
begins to separate, when the contents are well stirred 
and a portion thrown on to the work stone b. The lead 
runs into the pot, the grey slag is separated and the 
residue returned to the hearth and mixed with lime ; 
this is repeated at intervals, fresh fuel and ore being 
added as required. After some time, the cavity of the 
hearth becomes full of lead which flows along the gutters 
in the work stone into the lead pot. Two to three tons of 
lead are thus produced in about twelve to fourteen hours. 
This furnace is employed for poor ores where coal is scarce 
and peat plentiful. 

Method by reduction with iron and carbon. 
The method of smelting lead by roasting and reduc- 
tion in blast furnaces at Freiberg is explained in the 
chapter on silver. The same principle is adopted in 
Sweden. 

By the " Swedish process " the ore is smelted in two

141 



operations known as "raw" smelting and "lead" 
smelting. In the former, poor ores and various residues 
are smelted with iron pyrites, quartz, and lead slag in a 
blast furnace using charcoal fuel, to produce an argen- 
tiferous regulus and a clean slag. 

In the "lead" smelting, rich ores and products, together 
with the roasted regulus from the " raw " smelting, some 
slag and a little roasted iron pyrites are treated, pro- 
ducing three products 1. argentiferous lead ; 2. sul- 
phide of iron; 3. slag, which is a silicate of iron and lime, 
etc. The reduction of the galena is effected by iron re- 
duced from the roasted pyrites by means of carbon ; the 
sulphur of the galena unites with the iron, and the 
remaining iron along with lime are fluxed by the quartz, 
thus : 



Fe + PbS-FeS + Pb; 

FeO + CaO + SiO 2 = FeO,CaO,Si0 2 . 

At " Pontgibaud " a highly siliceous galena, rich in sil- 
ver, is smelted. The ore is first 
calcined in a reverberatory furnace, 
40 feet long x 15 feet wide, having 
six doors on each side. The ore is 
charged through a hopper at the 
flue end and gradually raked for- 
ward as the operation proceeds. 
The front part of the bed near the__ 
fire bridge is 6 inches lower than Fi s- 57 - 

the other part ; here the heat is sufficient to melt the 
charge, which is tapped at intervals of six hours. The 




142 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



roasting converts the galena into oxide and a little sul- 
phate and the final melting forms some silicate of lead. 
The product is smelted in the Castilian blast furnace, 
shown in Fig. 57. 

The furnace, constructed of blocks of lava bound with 
iron, is about 12 feet high x 3 feet wide, supported on 

iron pillars. The hearth con- 
tains three twyers. 

The roasted and fused mass 
is mixed with 10 per cent, 
scrap iron, 16 per cent, lime- 
stone, and 3 per cent, fluor- 
spar, together with some slags 
from a previous charge, and 
various residues. The pro- 
ducts are, impure argenti- 
ferous lead, 7 to 10 per cent, 
of regulus and slag. The 
reduction may be represented 
by the equation 

2PbO,Si0 
= 2FeO,Si 2 

In the " Hartz " and other 
parts of Germany, lead ore 
is smelted with basic silicate 
of iron in the Eachette fur- 
nace (Fig. 58). This furnace 
Fig. ss. i s oblong and rectangular in 

shape, being 3 feet wide at the twyers, 7 feet at the 
throat, and about 30 feet high, with a capacity of about 




LEAD FUME. 143 



2000 cubic feet. The object of this shape is to keep 
the ascending gases more to the centre, and thus cause a 
more perfect action on the descending solid materials. 
The blast is introduced through six or eight twyers, 
three of four being placed on each of the longer 
sides of the hearth, thus causing a better distribu- 
tion of the air. This furnace is also used in Russia 
for iron smelting, and for reducing copper slags in the 
Lake Superior district. The re-actions may be repre- 
sented thus 

2FeO,Si0 2 + PbS = PbO + FeO,Si0 2 + FeS 
2PbO + C = Pb 2 + C0 2 

from which it will be seen that the products are lead, 
regulus and slag. 

Electrolytic method Lead may be deposited 
electrolytically in a coherent state by operating on its 
alkaline solutions, preferably those containing phosphoric 
and tartaric acids. Galena must be roasted to oxide 
of lead, which is readily soluble in caustic potash and 
soda. 

Lead fume. The gases and vapours arising from 
lead smelting furnaces contain considerable quantities of 
lead, which are recovered by condensing the fume in suit- 
able flues or condensers. The most common method is 
to construct slightly inclined brick flues, which wind 
about in a serpentine manner, generally up the sides of 
a hill, the whole course extending in some cases for 
several miles before the vapours escape into the atmos- 
phere. Doors are fixed at intervals for purposes of 
cleaning out the condensed matter. 



144 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 




Another class of condenser consists of a divided cham- 
ber, containing water at the 
bottom, through which the 
vapours are drawn several 
times by means of a pump or 
other exhauster. Fig 59 
Fig. 59. shows Stagg's arrangement. 

Lead fume consists of lead sulphide, oxide, carbonate 
and sulphate, and sometimes silver, together with car- 
bonaceous matter, lime, alumina, oxide of iron, silica, 
etc. 

This condensed fume is treated with slags and other 
products in the slag hearth or furnace (which is generally 
a small cupola blast furnace), producing an impure lead 
known as " slag lead." The reduction of the lead 
compounds and the scorification of the impurities is 
effected by means of coal or coke and iron slags. The 
lead obtained is hard owing to the presence of sulphur, 
antimony, copper, iron, etc., and requires to be purified : 
this is effected in a reverberatory furnace, known as the 
" lead softening furnace." 

The softening furnace is a low reverberatory one ; 
the bed contains a shallow cast iron pan, in which 10 tons 
of hard lead are melted and exposed to an oxidizing flame, 
whereby the antimony, arsenic, copper, iron, etc., with 
some lead are oxidized and form a dross on the surface. 
This is periodically raked off and the refining con- 
tinued until a sample of the lead on trial shows the 
requisite malleability. The operation requires from 
eighteen to twenty-four hours. In some works a blast 
of air is used to assist the oxidation. 



RED LEAD. 145 



Reduction of oxidized compounds. Litharge, 

produced from cupellation, and skimmings from Pattin- 
son's pots, are reduced with small coal in a reverberatory 
furnace similar to the Flintshire furnace, or in a cupola, 
such as that used for reducing lead slags. 

MANUFACTURE OF RED LEAD (Pb 3 O 4 ). 

This oxide is prepared on the large scale by heating 
about 1 ton of lead in a reverberatory furnace so as to 
form massicot (PbO), known as the dressing stage, and 
afterwards colouring. The dross as it forms is scraped 
from the surface, thus exposing the molten lead to 
further oxidation, the whole being converted in about 
twenty-four hours. The massicot is allowed to cool, 
raked out, moistened with water and ground under 
edge stones to a fine powder. It is then washed 
with water, and carried forward in suspension by a 
stream of water, from which it is deposited in settling 
tanks. 

The next stage, called colouring, consists of placing 
dried massicot upon the bed of a reverberatory furnace, 
and carefully heating at a temperature of about 300 C. 
for two days, with frequent stirring, until the whole- 
appears of a dark red colour, which changes to bright red 
on cooling ; the furnace is then closed and allowed to 
slowly cool. The product is red lead, which, after grind- 
ing and sifting, is ready for use. Red lead is frequently 
adulterated with oxide of iron and brick dust, which 
may be detected by fusing a small portion, when the red 
lead is converted into yellow litharge, while the impuri- 

K 



146 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

ties retain their red colour. Red lead is reduced when 
heated with carbon thus 



White lead is a basic carbonate of lead, or a mixture 
of carbonate and hydrate in variable proportions, of which 
the following formula may be taken as a general guide 
2PbC0 3 , PbH 2 2 . It is prepared by exposing metallic 
lead to the action of moist air and carbonic acid. It is 
often adulterated with heavy spar, gypsum and zinc 
oxide. 



TIN. 147 



CHAPTEE IX. 

TIN (Sn). 

TIN is a white metal with great lustre, very malleable, 
but very low in tenacity. It melts at 230 C. and may be 
strongly heated without volatilizing. A bar of tin when 
bent produces a crackling sound known as the "cry," 
which is a rough test of its relative purity. Its specific 
gravity is 7 '25. It is little affected by air, but rapidly 
oxidizes when heated, forming stannic oxide (Sn0 2 ). 
When melted and poured at a temperature near its solidi- 
fying point the surface remains bright, if pure, but the 
presence of a little lead, iron, etc., imparts a dull or 
frosted appearance. The surface of tin or tin plate can 
be readily crystallized by treating it with a mixture of 
10 parts dilute sulphuric and 1 part of dilute nitric acid, 
the appearance being known as "moire'e m^tallique." 
Commercial tin often contains small portions of lead, 
iron, copper, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, tungsten ; some- 
times manganese and zinc. 

Alloys of tin. Tin plate is iron with a coating of 
tin on its surface, which will be brighter the purer the 
tin. Terne plate is an inferior quality, containing a little 
lead. Bronze contains 80 to 95 per cent, copper and 20 
to 5 per cent, tin ; bronze coinage contains 95 copper, 



143 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

4 tin, and 1 zinc ; gun metal, 80 to 90 copper and 20 to 
10 tin ; bell metal, 70 to 80 copper and 30 to 20 tin ; 
speculum metal, 2 copper, 1 tin, and a little arsenic ; for 
pewter and soft solder, see Lead; for Britannia metal 
and type metal, see Antimony ; for fusible alloy, see 
Bismuth. 

Tinning iron plates. The iron plates are first 
thoroughly cleansed in warm dilute sulphuric acid, then 
washed and scrubbed with sand to remove all traces 
of rust, which would prevent the tin from adhering ; 
the plates are then immersed in a bath of melted tallow, 
which dries them thoroughly. 

The tinning arrangement comprises five pots, each 
heated by a separate fire, and termed respectively the 
tin pot, washing pot (divided into two compartments), 
grease pot, cold pot and the list pot. The plates from 
the tallow or tinman's pot are placed in the tin pot, the 
surface of the molten tin being covered with tallow to 
prevent oxidation ; after being heated for an hour and a 
half in the melted metal they are removed, drained and 
plunged into the first division of the washing pot. This 
also contains molten tin ; then they are removed and 
brushed to remove excess of tin and afterwards quickly 
dipped into the tin in the second division to remove 
the brush marks. Then they are transferred to the 
grease pot containing melted tallow, which removes 
any excess of tin. After about ten minutes the plates 
are inserted in melted tallow contained in the cold 
pot. Lastly, in order to remove the tin which has 
drained down and formed a bead at the lower edge of 
the plate, each plate is placed in the list pot, which con- 



EXTRACTION OF TIN. 149 

tains melted tin about J inch deep ; by striking the 
plate sharply with a stick the superfluous metal is de- 
tached. The plates are then rubbed with bran and 
afterwards with sheepskin, when they are ready for use. 

An inferior variety of tin plate, in which the iron is 
coated with an alloy of tin and lead, is termed " terne 
plate." 

Ores of tin. The only important ore of tin is tin- 
stone (SnO._>), which is usually of a black or brown colour, 
and sometimes grey, with a specific gravity of 6 to 7. It 
is largely found in Cornwall, more or less mixed with 
wolfram, fluor-spar, granite, galena, blende, pyrites, etc. 
It is sometimes found in masses with concentric layers, 
and is then called " wood tin," sometimes in grains with 
sand called " stream tin," but generally in mineral veins 
called " mine tin." 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

Tin stone is smelted both in blast and reverberatory 
furnaces. 

The reverberatory method is conducted in two 
stages. Ores containing arsenic, sulphur, etc., are first 
roasted to expel these impurities and convert the metals 
into oxides and sulphates, the latter being afterwards 
dissolved out in water. 

The reduction is effected in an ordinary reverberatory 
furnace with a low slanting roof; the bed, about 18 feet 
by 9 feet, is hollowed out, all parts inclining towards the 
tap hole. The bottom is formed of iron, covered with 
slate, and lined internally with 7 to 8 inches of fire-clay. 
24 to 30 cwts. of ore are mixed with 4th their weight of 



150 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

anthracite, a little lime and fluor-spar being added as a 
flux. In five hours the mass is well rabbled, more 
anthracite is added and in about another hour the metal 
is ready for tapping. The slag is a silicate of iron con- 
taining other oxides. 

The metal reduced in the manner just described is 
very impure and requires to be refined. The pigs of tin 
are placed on the bed of a reverberatory furnace and 
gradually raised to the melting point of tin, when the tin 
liquates out, leaving a mass known as " hard head," which 
contains about 50 per cent, iron, 20 per cent, tin, 20 per 
cent, arsenic and a little sulphur, copper, etc. The 
liquated metal is melted in an iron pot and stirred with 
a pole of green wood ; this causes a boiling, due to the 
escape of gases, and brings the impurities iron, arsenic ; 
etc., to the surface. These are skimmed off from time to 
time. Instead of poling, the metal is sometimes raised 
in ladles and allowed to fall from a height into the pot. 
This is called " tossing." 

For " common " tin, the metal is ladled from the 
refining pot into moulds. For " refined " tin, purer ores 
are employed for its extraction and the poling operation 
continued longer. The metal is then allowed to settle. 
The upper portion being the purest is preserved for 
" grain " tin, the middle portion for common tin, and the 
bottom layers require to undergo another liquation and 
poling. The moulds used for casting are made of 
granite and the ingots are known as " block " tin. 

The peculiar structure of grain tin is produced by 
dropping the metal from a height when on the point of 
melting. 



DEPOSITION OF TIN. 



151 



Blast furnace method. In Germany, tin ore 
is smelted in a small charcoal blast 
furnace (Fig. 60). It is built of gran- 
ite and covered with a hood at the 
top. The metal and slag flow into the 
receptacle (A) and the liquid slag on 
the surface flows along a gutter into 
a vessel (B) containing water, in order 
to make it brittle, so that it may be 
easily broken up for re-smelting to 
recover the tin which it contains. 

Deposition of tin. Tin is de- 
posited on articles of brass, copper, 
or bronze, by immersing them in a boiling solution of 
peroxide of tin in caustic potash, in contact with cut- 
tings of metallic tin. The same solution may be 
used for tinning iron with the aid of a battery, using 
a large tin anode. Large crystals of tin may be formed 
by sending a strong current of electricity through a 
solution of stannous chloride, using a small anode. 




152 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



CHAPTEE X. 

NICKEL (Ni). 

NICKEL is a brilliant white, malleable, ductile, weldablc 
and very tenacious metal, with a melting point only a 
little below that of iron, but the presence of carbon and 
other impurities considerably lowers this point. Its 
specific gravity is 9 and it is magnetic like iron, 
although in a much less degree. It does not readily 
oxidize in air, but when heated it forms nickel oxide 
(NiO). It readily unites with sulphur, forming NiS, 
which is brass-yellow in colour, and with arsenic to form 
Ni 2 As. When nickel is fused with carbon, the two 
elements combine to form a compound more fusible 
and brittle than pure nickel, in proportion to the 
amount of carbon taken up ; in this respect it resembles 
iron. 

Nickel speise is a yellowish white, brittle, metallic 
looking substance, consisting of nickel and arsenic with 
sulphur, iron, cobalt, etc., and occasionally contains anti- 
mony and copper. When heated in air or oxygen, the 
elements are oxidized in the order of their oxidizability 
sulphur and iron first, then cobalt, then nickel. 

Alloys Of nickel. The chief alloy of nickel is 
German silver, or nickel silver, which consists of copper,

Ores of nickel. Kupfer nickel or copper nickel 
(NiAs.,) is a copper-red coloured mineral with a metallic 
lustre. Nickel pyrites (NiS) is brassy-yellow in colour. 
Nickel-glance is a variable compound of nickel, arsenic 
and sulphur. Garnierite is a hydrated silicate of nickel, 
iron, and magnesium. 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

The extraction of nickel from its ores consists of three 
stages 1. Concentration by roasting to form regulus or 
speise. 2. Conversion of regulus or speise into oxide by 
dry or wet methods. 3. Reduction of nickel oxide by 
carbon. 

The extraction is based on the following principles, 
cobalt being generally present : 

1. When sulphides or arsenides of nickel and cobalt 
are fused with an acid silicate of iron, the cobalt passes 
into the slag, but the nickel does not leave the regulus 
or speise. 

2. When oxides of nickel and cobalt are smelted with 
sulphur or arsenic, the nickel unites with the sulphur or 
arsenic, but the cobalt only partially. 



154 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

3. When silicates of nickel and cobalt are fused with 
sulphur or arsenic, the nickel forms a regulus or speise, 
but the cobalt does not leave the silicate. 

Dry method. The dry method of extracting nickel 
is very similar to the process for extracting copper, con- 
sisting of alternate roastings and meltings, in which 
advantage is taken of the superior affinity of nickel for 
sulphur and arsenic (as shown in the preceding prin- 
ciples), by which it is preserved from oxidation, while 
the more oxidizable metals are being removed. 

Wet method. The wet method is the one most 
generally adopted, being necessary when much cobalt is 
present in the ore. The scheme Fig. 61 represents 
one mode of treating nickel ore 

1. The ore is ground and calcined to remove arsenic 
and sulphur as far as possible; 2. dissolved in hot 
hydrochloric acid ; 3. bleaching powder is added to per- 
oxidize the iron, which is precipitated as basic arseniate 
of iron ; 4. the filtrate is treated with sulphuretted 
hydrogen, which precipitates copper as sulphide ; 5. the 
filtrate containing nickel and cobalt is boiled to expel 
sulphuretted hydrogen and neutralized with lime ; 6. 
oxide of cobalt is precipitated with bleaching powder 
and the solution filtered ; 7. oxide of nickel is pre- 
cipitated by boiling with milk of lime ; 8. nickel oxide 
is reduced by carbon. 

Oxide of nickel is sometimes reduced by making it 
into a paste with carbon, cutting it into cakes or cubes, 
placing these in crucibles or tubes and raising them to a 
white heat while surrounded with charcoal. 

Nickel plating. Nickel is largely used in electro

plating, its great hardness enabling it to resist wear 
much better than silver. The best solution to employ 
is the double sulphate of nickel and ammonia, of which 
1 2 ounces to the gallon form a good proportion. Articles 
to receive a deposit must be perfectly clean and should 
be previously polished as brightly as possible. 

COBALT (Co). 

Cobalt is .a metal of a steel-grey colour and very 
similar to nickel in many of its properties. Its specific 
gravity is 8*9 ; it is extremely malleable and very 
tenacious. It does not oxidize at ordinary temperatures, 
but at a red heat forms a mixture of CoO and Co 3 4 . It 
unites with arsenic to form iron-grey, fusible and brittle 
compounds, when arsenic and cobalt are fused together. 

Ores of cobalt. The principal ores of cobalt are 
smaltine (Co As), cobalt-glance (Co 2 AsS) and cobalt 
bloom (Co 3 As0 4 , 4H 2 0). It is also often associated with 
nickel ores. 

Alloys. Cobalt forms with tin a somewhat ductile 
alloy of a violet colour ; with iron a hard alloy ; and 
with brass it forms alloys resembling German silver. 

Cobalt is only sparingly employed in the arts in the 
metallic state, but its compounds form valuable pigments. 

Oxide of Cobalt is prepared from cobalt speise by 
the wet way, as described on page 154, and is used for 
imparting a blue colour to glass, enamel and pottery. 

Smalt. This is a double silicate of cobalt and 
potassium, also called cobalt glass. Its preparation is 
conducted in two stages 1. the ore is calcined to expel 



COBALT COMPOUNDS. 157 

arsenic sulphur, etc. ; 2. fased with sand and carbonate of 
potash, when it forms a deep blue glass. 

Zaffire is an ore of cobalt containing sufficient silica 
to form smalt when fused with carbonate of potash. 

Printers' blue is used for painting the blue colour on 
pottery and china, etc. It is prepared by fritting a mix- 
ture of silica, oxide of cobalt, nitre and a little barium- 
sulphate.

CHAPTEE XI. 
ALUMINIUM (Al). 

THIS is a white metal which takes a fine polish. It has no 
taste or odour. It is soft, very malleable and ductile, with 
an elasticity and tenacity about equal to that of silver. Its 
specific gravity is 2'5, which is increased by hammering ; 
it melts at a temperature a little above that of zinc, and 
is not volatile when strongly heated out of contact with 
air. Its conductivity for heat and electricity is very high, 
as is also its specific heat. It does not oxidize in air or 
combine with sulphur ; it is insoluble in cold nitric acid ; 
sulphuric acid has no action on it, but hydrochloric acid 
and alkalies dissolve it readily. 

Ores of aluminium. Aluminium occurs in a variety 
of forms as oxide, but more generally in combination 
with other metals, such as zinc, iron, magnesium, etc., 
forming aluminates. It exists as silicate in all clays. 
Also as fluoride in cryolite (6NaF, A1 2 F 6 ). 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

The general method depends on the action of sodium 
at a red heat upon the chloride, fluoride, or double fluoride 
of sodium and aluminium. 



EXTRACTION OF ALUMINIUM. 159 

10 parts of the double chloride of aluminium and 
sodium, 5 parts of fluor-spar and 2 parts of sodium are 
heated in a closed reverberatory furnace, when a vivid 
action ensues, evolving great heat. When the reduction 
is complete, the main portion of the slag is run off first, 
and then the aluminium which collects at the bottom 
of the receptacle under a layer of liquid slag. The 
upper and lighter portion of the slag consists chiefly 
of common salt, the heavier and more infusible por- 
tion is chiefly aluminium fluoride containing shots of 
metal. 

Cryolite which occurs abundantly in West Greenland 
is the most valuable ore of aluminium and is extensively 
used as a source of the metal. The powdered mineral 
is mixed with half its weight of common salt and the 
mixture arranged in alternate layers with sodium, using 
2 parts of sodium to 5 parts of cryolite. 

Aluminium may be freed from copper and iron by 
fusion with nitre, and from zinc by volatilization of the 
latter. Slag may be removed by melting the metal in a 
blacklead crucible and stirring with an oxidized iron rod. 

The cheap production of aluminium depends to a large 
extent on the price of sodium. This metal has lately 
been obtained by a new process introduced by Castner, 
which it is stated reduces the cost of production from four 
shillings to one shilling per pound. The charge consists 
of caustic soda, mixed with a mixture of iron and carbon, 
obtained by coking pitch with iron filings. The iron 
makes the particles of carbon heavier and keeps them 
from floating to the surface, so that the soda is more 
perfectly reduced and a lower temperature can be em- 



160 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

ployed with a great saving of fuel. The operation is 
conducted in large crucibles. 

Aluminium may be obtained by electrolysis. The 
double chloride or fluoride of aluminium and sodium is 
fused at a high temperature in a crucible divided into 
two parts by a porous diaphragm. A strong current is 
sent through the liquid, using carbon or platinum elec- 
trodes, when the metal is deposited at the negative pole. 

The Cowles Electric Smelting Co. have succeeded 
in reducing aluminium compounds by carbon, or by 
dissociation assisted by carbon, in an electric furnace. 
The interior of the furnace is lined with carbon, and 
through this runs a core of carbon blocks which are 
traversed by an electric current from a powerful dynamo. 
The carbon is raised to an intense heat, and if oxide of 
aluminium in the form of corundum, is mingled with the 
carbon, aluminium is separated ; but some of the metal 
is volatilized. 

Alloys. Aluminium bronze consists of 90 parts 
copper and 10 parts aluminium. It has a gold colour, 
takes a high polish, is very hard and malleable and has 
a tenacity of 48 tons per square inch. The addition of 
2 to 3 per cent, of brass increases its tensile strength 
and renders it less liable to oxidation. The addition of 
nickel to aluminium bronze also increases its strength. 
When more than 10 per cent, of aluminium is present 
with copper, the malleability is diminished and 15 to 20 
per cent, forms a brittle alloy. 

Silver, iron, and zinc alloyed with aluminium form 
hard and brittle alloys. 

Alloys of aluminium may be prepared by heating 



ALUMINIUM ALLOYS. 161 

alumina with carbon and some metal such as copper. 
In this way aluminium copper is made in the Cowles 
electric furnace, which alloy is afterwards employed 
in making aluminium bronze. 

Aluminium unites with mercury when mixed with 
sodium amalgam, or when dipped in a potash solution 
containing mercury. 



162 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



CHAPTER XTT. 
MERCURY OR QUICKSILVER (Hg). 

MERCURY is silver white with a brilliant lustre. It is 
the only metal liquid at the ordinary temperature ; at 
360 C. it boils; its specific gravity is 13-6; it has a 
high and fairly regular coefficient of expansion for heat, 
which renders it suitable for thermometers and similar 
instruments. It does not oxidize in air except near its 
boiling point, which forms a ready means of detecting 
the presence of base metals that exist in it as impurities 
or adulterations. 

Vermilion. Mercury forms an important compound 
with sulphur, known as vermilion (HgS), which is prepared 
by gradually adding 200 Ibs. of mercury to 32 Ibs. of mol- 
ten sulphur in an iron pot, with constant stirring; the mass 
is then poured on to an iron slab and broken up, then 
placed in earthen crucibles and sublimed. Vermilion 
has a beautiful red colour, and sublimes unchanged when 
heated out of contact with air. Heated with access of 
air it is decomposed, mercury and sulphurous acid being 
formed. It is also decomposed when heated with carbon, 
iron and most metals, lime, alkalies and hydrogen. 

Amalgams. Mercury unites with most metals form- 



MERCURY. 163 



ing " amalgams," some of which are liquid, others semi- 
liquid and some solid. The solid amalgams are regarded 
as chemical compounds, while the liquid amalgams may 
be solutions of compounds in excess of mercury. But the 
affinity is feeble, as the mercury is partially expelled by 
pressure, and completely so by heat in most cases. 
Amalgams are formed 1. by rubbing the metal in a 
finely divided state with mercury, an increase of temper- 
ature facilitating the amalgamation ; 2. by dipping the 
metal into the solution of a mercury salt ; 3. by voltaic 
action, as when a metal is placed in contact with mer- 
cury and an acid ; 4. by mixing a metal such as gold 
with an amalgam of a highly positive metal such as 
sodium. 

An amalgam of mercury with tin is used in silvering 
mirrors ; with gold and silver in water gilding, and with ' 
tin and gold or platinum in dentistry, etc. Sodium amal- 
gam is prepared by rubbing the two metals together in a 
covered mortar. An amalgam of 30 parts mercury to 1 
part sodium is solid. It is used for amalgamating iron 
and platinum and in the extraction of gold and silver 
from their ores. 

Ores of mercury. Mercury sometimes occurs native, 
mixed with other of its ores or with gangue, or as an 
amalgam with silver ; occasionally as chloride, bromide 
and iodide of mercury. The chief source of the metal 
is the sulphide (HgS), known as " cinnabar." It is a 
brownish red mineral, moderately soft and gives a scarlet 
streak when drawn across unglazed porcelain.

ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



MODES OF EXTRACTION. 

Mercury being a volatile metal is obtained by a process 
of distillation like zinc, but a far more extensive con- 
densing arrangement is required. The various methods 
may be classed under two heads 1. air reduction; 
2. reduction by iron or lime. 

1. Air reduction. The mode of decomposition may 
be represented by the equation HgS + 2 = S0 2 + Hg. At 
Almaden, in Spain, the reduction chamber is a "dome" 
furnace (see Fig. 6), with an opening near the top com- 
municating with a system of earthenware condensers 
called "aludels" (Fig. 62). 




Fig. 62. 

The Hahner furnace (Fig. 63) consists of a vertical 
cylinder (A), 18 feet high and 3 feet 8 inches in diameter, 
into which the ore is fed from a hopper ; six condensing 
chambers (BB), the roofs of which are covered with an 
iron plate, which forms the floor of a tank, through which 
water is kept circulating. The vapours are compelled 
to pass in the direction of the arrows, the communication 
between the chambers being alternately at top and

bottom. The current is maintained by a chimney 
draught. The chimney is built in three tiers, in each of 
which are ledges kept cool by water flowing over them 
so as to complete the condensation. The charge consists 
of 7 cwts. ore with 5 per cent, of charcoal. The furnace 
is worked continuously. 

The Alberti furnace (Fig. 64) is employed for " smalls" 




Fig. 64 

and poor ores, containing about 1 per cent, of mercury. 
It consists of a reverberatory furnace (A), capable of 
holding 3 tons, with a sloping bed arranged in three 
steps, the ore being gradually pushed forward from the 
flue end to the fire bridge. The vapours pass into a con- 
denser (B), and thence along the iron tubes (c), then 
into a condenser (D), up into (E), then back through the 
tubes (F) into a chamber (G) at the base of the chimney, 
which is obstructed by a number of partitions, around 
which the vapours pass so as to condense any remaining 
mercury. The iron pipes (c and r) are kept cool by 
running water. 

Closed retorts have also been employed for mercury 
ores using lime, iron, or oxide of iron as the reducing 
agent, when the following re- actions occur - 



166 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

4HgS + 4CaO - 3CaS + CaS0 4 + 4Hg 
HgS + Fe = FeS + Hg 
5HgS + Fe 3 4 = 3FeS + 5Hg + 2S0 2 . 

Mercury is purified from zinc, bismuth, antimony, and 
tin, which form its chief impurities, by placing it in a 
retort, covering with iron filings and distilling the mer- 
cury, which is condensed by the leading pipe dipping 
into water. 



ANTIMONY. 167 



CHAPTER XIII. 

ANTIMONY (Sb). 

ORDINARY commercial antimony is very impure, con- 
taining iron, lead, arsenic, and sulphur and is called 
" regulus of antimony." Antimony is a brilliant bluish 
white metal, highly crystalline, with fern-like markings 
on the surface and very brittle, so that it may be easily 
powdered ; its specific gravity is 6 -8 ; it melts at 450 C., 
and volatilizes at a higher temperature. It does not 
oxidize at ordinary temperatures, but when heated in 
air, antimonious oxide (Sb 2 O 3 ) is formed, and at a red 
heat it burns with a bluish white flame producing dense 
white fumes of Sb 2 3 . 

Antimony and sulphur readily unite when heated to- 
gether forming Sb 2 S 3 ; the same compound is also formed 
by heating the oxide with sulphur, thus 

2Sb 2 3 + 9S = 3S0 2 + 2Sb 2 S 3 . 

When this sulphide is roasted in air or fused with nitre, 
the oxide is re-formed. It is also decomposed by fusion 
with carbon, iron, tin, copper, potassium cyanide and a 
mixture of carbonate of soda and charcoal. Sb 2 S 3 is a 
bluish grey crystalline compound, with a metallic 
lustre. 



168 ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 

Alloys of antimony. Antimony unites with other 
metals to form valuable alloys in consequence of its 
hardening properties, but it impairs the malleability 
and ductility of the malleable metals. Type metal 
sometimes contains 17 to 20 per cent, of antimony 
and 83 to 80 of lead, and sometimes 50 lead, 25 tin, 
and 25 antimony. For stereotype plates, 70 lead, 15 
antimony and 15 bismuth are used; and for music 
plates, the alloy contains 12 tin, 7 lead, and 1 antimony. 
Britannia metal has a variable composition, but the fol- 
lowing may be taken as a guide, 90 tin, 7 antimony, and 
3 copper. A violet coloured alloy known as " regulus of 
Venus," contains 50 copper and 50 antimony. The 
effect of even small quantities of antimony on the malle- 
able metals, such as copper, gold, iron, etc., is most in- 
jurious, making them hard and brittle. 

Ores of antimony. Antimony occurs native and 
in combination with other ores, but the chief ore is 
"Stibnite"(Sb 2 S 3 ). 

METHODS OF EXTRACTION. 

The reduction of stibnite is performed in two stages 
1. liquation, by which the sulphide is separated from 
its gangue; 2. reduction of the sulphide by means of 
iron, carbon, etc. 

The liquation is effected in the Hartz by placing the 
ore in conical pots covered at the top, perforated at 
the bottom, and standing on receivers sunk in the 
ground ; the space between the pots is occupied by the 
fire. The fused sulphide runs through the perforations, 



EXTRACTION OF ANTIMONY. 



169 



and collects in the receivers placed below. At Malbose 

in France, the ore is placed 

in large cylinders (A) (Fig. 

65), perforated at bottom, 

each holding 500 Ibs., four 

being placed in one furnace, 

and standing on per- 

forated plates (B) beneath 

which are chambers contain- 

ing earthen receivers for 

the liquated material. At 

Linz, the liquation is per- 

formed in a reverberatory furnace, the bed inclining 

towards the tap hole through which the liquated sulphide 

flows into a receiver placed outside. 

The reduction of the sulphide in England is performed 
in large crucibles heated in circular wind furnaces. Each 
crucible is charged with 40 Ibs. of sulphide and 20 Ibs. of 
scrap iron, the product being impure antimony and sul- 
phide of iron, thus 




Fig. 65. 



The crude metal is then melted in crucibles with sul- 
phate of soda and a little slag from the next process, the 
charge consisting of 80 Ibs. metal, 2 Ibs. salt cake and a 
little slag. 

The metal thus obtained is melted with pearl ash and 
some slag, and cast into ingots for commerce. With rich 
ores the preliminary liquation is unnecessary. 



170 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



ARSENIC (As). 

This metal has a steel-grey colour and metallic lustre ; 
is exceedingly brittle and crystalline ; its specific gravity 
is 47 ; when heated to 180 C., it passes into vapour 
without liquefying, but may be liquefied when heated 
under pressure. Heated in air it oxidizes and burns 
with a blue flame evolving a garlic odour and forming 
white fumes of As 2 3 . 

The white oxide (As 2 3 ) called arsenious acid exists in 
the amorphous and crystalline 
forms. It is obtained from the 
calcination of many ores con- 
taining arsenic, forming trans- 
parent masses called arsenical 
glass. It is purified by re-sub- 
liming in deep iron vessels 
(Fig. 66), and collecting the 
vapours in a divided condens- 
ing chamber. When heated 
with carbon, carbonic oxide, or 
hydrogen below redness, it is 
reduced to metallic arsenic, 




Fig. 60. 



thus 



2As 2 3 + 30 = 3C0 2 + 4As. 



Arsenic forms two compounds with sulphur realgar 
(As 2 S 2 ) and orpiment (As 2 S 3 ). 

Yellow orpiment or king's yellow (As 2 S 3 ) is prepared 
by subliming a mixture of 7 parts (As 2 3 ) with 1 part 
sulphur. 



BISMUTH. 171 



Realgar is an amorphous, brownish red substance, 
obtained by fusing 1 part of arsenic with 2 parts of 
sulphur or 2 parts of As 2 3 with 7 parts of sulphur. 

Ores of arsenic. Arsenic occurs in nature as 
realgar, orpiment, mispickel (FeAs + FeS), nickel 
pyrites (NiAs), and kupfer-nickel or copper nickel 
(NiAs 2 ). 

Method of extraction. The metal is obtained by 
heating nickel pyrites, mispickel, etc., in closed retorts, 
when the arsenic is expelled and sublimes into condensing 
chambers. 

Alloys of arsenic. Arsenic enters into the com- 
position of some alloys such as shot metal, its general effect 
being to harden and render the alloys brittle and 
more fusible. Its compounds are used in medicine and 
in glass making. 

BISMUTH (Bi). 

Bismuth has a greyish white colour with a tinge of red 
and bright lustre ; it is brittle and crystalline ; it fuses at 
270 C., and volatilizes at a high temperature, burning 
with a blue flame, forming " flowers of bismuth " (Bi 2 3 ). 
It expands on cooling, so that the metal is denser in the 
liquid than in the solid state; its specific gravity is 9 '9, 
which is reduced by pressure ; it oxidizes in moist air, 
and may be used in place of lead in cupellation. It 
unites with sulphur, forming a dark grey metallic look- 
ing sulphide (Bi 2 S 3 ). 

Ores of bismuth. It occurs in the metallic state 
as bismuth-glance (Bi 2 S 3 ), as ochre (Bi 2 3 ), and often 



172 



ELEMENTARY METALLURGY. 



accompanies 
cobalt. 



ores of silver, lead, tin, copper and 




Method of extrac- 
tion. Bismuth is sep- 
arated from several of 
its ores by liquation. 
The furnace employed 
is shown in Fig. 67. 
It contains a series of 
iron tubes inclining 
towards the front, in 

which the ore is placed. The fireplace is below, wood 
fuel being employed. The liquated metal is received 
in iron pots kept hot by a separate fire. It is purified 
by re-melting with nitre. 

Alloys of bismuth. Bismuth is used chiefly in 
alloys to render them easily fusible ; they also expand 
on solidifying, especially the alloys of bismuth with 
antimony. Fusible alloy consists of 1 part lead, 1 of 
tin and 2 of bismuth ; the addition of a little cadmium 
makes it still more fusible ; this is known as " Wood's 
alloy," and melts at 82 C,
