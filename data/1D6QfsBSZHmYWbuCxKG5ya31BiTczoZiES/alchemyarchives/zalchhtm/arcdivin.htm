  <p>The Arcana Divina, as published in manuscript form, in what is to
follow,
originally came from the Ossegg Cistercian Foundation of Bohemia. The
manuscripts
consists of sheets fastened together in folio format. Since the
information
given by the authors, as well as their of publication, has not been
strictly
verified, it cannot therefore be accurately determined whether an
original
manuscript or merely a copy is under consideration here. The entire
nature
of the manuscript report, which cannot yet be ascribed to the organized
written effort of individual people, or even to an actual stage of
development,
while other words, appended subsequently, probably appear in the
manuscript
due to additions in the 17th century. In order for the alchemical
literature
to make a contribution, the manuscript is translated freely enough that
an inquiry from the Biographical Institute of Berlin involving a
subsequent
publication of the Arcana Divina would not be required. Critical
remarks
about subject matter and text of this publication will be the subject
of
a later investigation. </p>

  <p>From the providence of God, on an actual basis: The source and
fabric
of wisdom, the Rock of Ages, from whom no secrets are hidden and at the
same time, from all three Persons a universal work will be
accomplished,
which we will reveal, openly to you through God&#8217;s love in our
subsequent
writings; which we carried out even as we were commanded to do. </p>
  <p>The first man, Adam, was a universal man made in the image of God,
from
whom his son Seth afterwards derived children and descendants, which
had
knowledge of all this. So two columns were provided --- one of water,
the
other of fire --- both with rejoicing. </p>
  <p>Since afterwards the flood of sins came from the Assyrians and the
Chaldeans,
and after Abraham&#8217;s time, from the Egyptians, and finally fro Greece,
such
columns were destroyed in the abomination of desolation. See! In those
times there was distress and there were lamentation; indeed so, but
nevertheless
everything will be revealed so that no longer will anything remain
hidden,
as though exposed by the brilliant light of the sun, with its golden
rays,
but those who are still able to rejoice at that very moment because of
the unmerited mercy of God, will be made whole. </p>
  <p>Oh, Almighty God, Oh Wonderful Creator, Oh Light of Unfathomable
Eternity,
enlighten us and send us your Holy Spirit, by the help of whom we will
be able to fulfill our calling completely in Thy Holy Will and to Thine
Honor and Glory, given to us in that great Mystery for the races of men
who are to follow us and leave behind us, as much as it is possible, a
useful record and thereby show our love for the Eternal God and to
honor
His Holy Name and to praise Him. </p>
  <p>Will you then, oh man, consider that you, who should consider
this,
our writing, and come to realize that it is of very great value, since
it will cause you to marvel at the Majesty of God and the miracles he
performs
daily. Moreover, where the Majesty of God is not thwarted, so that
(even
as in Joshua&#8217;s time) the sun can be made to stand still in its daily
course
for a period of 24 hours and entire mountains can be consumed in flames
of fire, while such shadows still surround us that we must trust God
for
everything. One day, however, we will soon come to understand our true
worth and, submitting to God&#8217;s sovereignty, we shall make a proper
beginning
with Jehovah and give to Him the highest Glory He merits. Thus we will
write to you herewith in the certain assurance on the basis of all
three
realms of Nature, each in itself alone being made manifest from
Universal
Knowledge. In you ultimately will come to reside these highest and
greatest
treasures which are possible, and in which lie the basis for all wisdom
and knowledge. The Creator and Maintainer of all who are in need,
especially
making whole all who are sick in spirit, the Liberator and Saviour of
all
those who are in prison, and the Overcome of all obstacles in the whole
world, and the Possessor of that wisdom that comes from the Most High
God,
which He has had throughout all eternity and which remains in Him
unchangeable
through all eternity and always will, until revealed by Him. </p>
  <p>Many, indeed almost all, of the great philosophers strive with
great
zeal to find a universal solution for all problems and devote
considerable
amounts of time, effort and expense, but as yet, in our times, they
have
not been able to provide such assurance as is suitable for this effort
and this has resulted only in deceptive boasts from those who have
attempted
such things and has limited the materialistically inclined and cooled
the
ardor of those who saw the impossibility of demonstrating the results
hoped
for by the use of mercury in demonstrations using various kinds of
wood,
coal and lamp oil. So drastic were these results that such materials
must
always be treated with caution. Finally, by penetrating this chaotic
mass
of information, from which it was originally taken, the results
indicated
here were those arrived at. </p>
  <p>For this reason we report to you and tell you that it should be
understood
from the beginning, under circumstances where you will be considered an
expert in this matter, that even a learned philosopher or practitioner
on the subject of fire, will find that working with combustible
material
is quite dangerous and, even more, during the preparation of such
materials
in the natural course of events of such things, the danger is added to
and even compounded. It could be demonstrated to you just where we
might
want to discontinue such precautions in an effort to save time, such
error
will now be pointed out to you as inadvisable. </p>
  <p>Just as the familiar mercury involves the correct method of using
our
apparatus and the passion for Natural Philosophy (i.e., Science) is the
primary object for our art and the body of knowledge about life is of
necessity
to be sought after, so there must be a universal solvent which can be
prepared
according to our standards of measurement. </p>
  <p>Let it now here be correctly understood (and trust that Nature
will
be on our side and help us) that taking the familiar mercury and
putting
it in a sealed receptacle in front of our apparatus, as noted in out
first
tabulation (index) and in several ways in our first experiments
indicated
at the end of our work, such as the separation of the mercury through
our
"magical Natural Fire" in the form of a cloud which rises to the top of
the receptacle, leading to the receiver, without the passing over of
the
heavy material (introduced) as a continuous flow of liquid, while the
active
spirit (reactive gases) evolving therefrom still remains confined to an
area in which further measurements can be made. This can be made now
not
only on metals and minerals but also upon vegetables and animal matter
in aqueous solution, as well as the original material in water in which
the living spirit (active principle) is retained without being
distorted
at all along with its entire power to grow; and also that henceforth no
more can be brought, in the future, as had been obtained previously,
and
then it will be a matter solely of operating with our same magic and
our
passion for Science and can readily from time to time, within the span
of three hours, produce an entirely new material, and far better than
would
seem probable by its creation therefrom. We will now report on our
study
of this process and instruct you further about its character. Here is
how
you should make a quantity of such a universal solvent. </p>
  <p>Here we will demonstrate the true philosophical purpose (using the
Philosophers&#8217;
Stone, by the help of a permissive God and our magical knowledge of
Nature).
Fire must be used, but nothing else is required that is necessary for
life.
Astral spirits, from which all&nbsp; of the elements arise, are created
by God and through Him is everything created that has been created,
even
to the end of the world, and it will be under His control, for without
Him there is nothing at all, except death. Therefore, it falls to us,
through
the Holy Orders of God to us who dwell here below, in all the Kingdoms
of the World, which produce, maintain, and even cause the increase in
everything
that life has here. Where, however, planting is the earthly realm, you
see, it represents the plan of creation, which is no other than a
purposeful
idea. Thus Nitrum (crude sodium carbonate) when mixed intimately with
common
salt, even though impure, can be a beautiful thing, but the impurities
can bring, in this instance, a heavenly appearance through our magical
natural philosophy ("natural fire"). The same now gives up its
effectiveness
and becomes a splendid magnet with which we continue our evaluation,
which
subsequently will follow with more than one example, which will suffice
for the present. We shall now bring out the pertinent points about
mercurial
properties. </p>
  <p>How splendid and strong this love of nature is portrayed and tests
the
general idea of a world spirit, which is the true philosophic subject,
and the only one of all of them, through which the most discerning
thoughts
are fulfilled, is to be seen as true by them, since a pound of mercury
in pure form is placed in an open glass dish specifically selected for
this purpose and for our magical passion for science (i.e., the
"natural
fire") as well: That the focus might not be too strongly affected and
even,
little by little, might tolerate a little Nitrum thereupon, so that it
will then be see how sodium carbonate behaves like the universal spirit
of a magnet of the world, toward the mercury which is present in the
liquid
state and serves as a universal standard. Some, and to a certain extent
the most part, may be selected. Philosophical concepts will result only
when these processes will be able to make gold and other noble metals,
but not including minerals. </p>
  <p>Three is a prima material which is considered to be the first
(original)
material from which the Philosophers&#8217; Stone or the Universal Tincture
can
be produced. This is very likely an impossibility since, as is widely
but
mistakenly believed, by reducing it to such a state, no other use can
be
obtained from it. Still, as has been previously indicated, it may even
remain for a long time in a higher state, by exerting greater care in
an
ordinary fire. Yet it is still possible that nothing of universal value
may result, but only an empty idea, the particulars of which are not
worth
mentioning here, that the transmutation of metals has been known to
take
place. When, however, such an occurrence does take place, it is of a
magical
nature known only to us and involves heating of the salt on our
apparatus,
which salt must be nitrified to a strong degree by the process of
ethereal
calcinations followed by treatment with nitric acid, whereby it is
quite
possible to obtain a thousand times greater yield than from previous
methods.
This volatile mercury vapor, then, can be dissolved in vitriol
(sulfuric
acid) with vigorous action, resulting in the transmutation of all
imperfect
metallic materials into large amounts of gold and silver, each of the
finest
quality. But know you from the outset that this vitriol (from which you
will recover the gold, will be the same ferment as that from which you
will recover the silver) requires that you have to have a particularly
rich (i.e., concentrated) tincture, that is, there is no universal
material,
of long standing which will apparently be useful to you, even to a very
limited extent, for without the ferment there will be no progress
toward
transmutation at all. So we will now examine this, very briefly, and
report
to you further about this. </p>
  <p>How and in what way control of all types of medicinal materials
and
mineral (both pure and impure), regardless of the dosage, will be
brought
about will become a completely fixed standard. </p>
  <p>We will now describe to you substances that can be both wild and
domestic
medicinal agents and minerals, noting thereon the weight and
registering
them under such crude designations as given them by the mountainous
areas
where they were obtained and then further classifying them to the
extent
that it is possible, so that it happens that when the crude earth is
dried
and then mixed with a little natural soda (i.e., sodium carbonate) on a
clean, flat piece of tile and subsequently exposed to the magical
Philosophers&#8217;
Stone and then afterwards calcined and stirred with a small stirrer,
while
heat was applied evenly, so that when the product was finished and the
calcined materials weighed, a miracle was observed. That is to say,
there
was a significant increase --- nay, even a large increase --- in the
gross
weight found, as though this magical preparation were able to capture
and
concentrate the Spirit of the World and be blessed by the resulting
increase
in its value as well. Both wild and domestic mineral products
themselves,
without the addition of anything except the attaching of the universal
magnet, can provide the best metals available, which can then be put to
the best use. </p>
  <p>In addition to the above, we must also add the following
information
which should prove useful to you and it is not at all astonishing that
both the refined minerals and the crude minerals can be used in
increased
amounts after contact with our Philosophers&#8217; Stone, so that even the
volatilized
sulfur can be fixed and then volatilized. Whether it follows that by
such
an operation (which must not be attributed, at least in part, to the
universal
magnet), the Spirit of the World resides therein and participates in
the
same, when a mineral containing sulfur will then be in a crude state,
as
indeed it almost always will be, it should be taken, registered, and
subsequently
subjected to calcinations by our apparatus and then nitrified. This
material
is, in turn, pulverized and in this condition fused with gold dust,
along
with some of our Philosophers&#8217; Stone, whereupon in two hours it will be
turned into a perfect tincture of silver, where one part in a thousand
is extracted in the gold dust, whereupon the Secret of Secrets will be
revealed. </p>
  <p>Not a single one of all the great secrets will be revealed without
knowledge
of our magic and the Philosophers&#8217; Stone, and I tell you that the great
Secret of al Secrets, which from the beginning to end reveals all
things
from Almighty God, established by His holiest principles that which
also
abodes forever and will be governed by Hi, so that all things which you
discover will be dependent on His revelation to you. So, mark it well
and
fix it foremost in your mind that the work of God&#8217;s only Spirit enables
you to participate in all of this, so that you will be revealed to you
will be brought to light by the Eternal One. </p>
  <p>We will now further pursue our revelation in an exemplary manner,
and
with God&#8217;s Holy Spirit make a proper introduction to the truth of our
knowledge
of philosophy in a worthy manner and point out how everything flows out
from the Eternal Center and enlightens to His Holy Nature, but before
we
write about universal truths applying to both the world of the
microcosm
and the world of the macrocosm, we will start with the realm of
minerals
as the beginning in which imperfect and impaired metals are found in
the
brilliance of the Sun in all its glory, and this provides very little
for
us to use. </p>
  <p>Now, then, take in the Holy Name of God, the crude gold-bearing
mineral
cobalt, discovered and obtained in the mines, as previously noted, was
used in the secret preparation, which was then placed on a flat piece
of
tile and mixed with a little Nitre and allowed to remain for 2, 3, or
even
4 hours, whereupon an astonishing change will be noted in the manner in
which this material behaves, since there is now a penetrating force of
the General Spirit of the World; which shows an increased oscillation
and
finally, to a very pronounced degree, reveals its astral nature: on
heating
to a brilliant red, an artificial ruby-red gemstone of inestimable
value,
exceeding the value of gold and termed the Treasure of Treasures
results.
When, however, the ferment involving an artificial gemstone such as
just
described is set aside you have a tincture suitable for preparing all
metals. </p>
  <p>When, however, you observe flakes of gold in the artificial
gemstones
which have been heated in our astral natural fire, you will observe
that
after vitrification, it becomes a royal treasure, and such a
magnificent
stone of this nature has never at any time been obtained in the natural
state, regardless of the length of the search. And this is still the
case
at this present time. </p>
  <p>How, and in what manner, can a gemstone be produced in an hour? </p>
  <p>Take a quintel of fine gold, put it on a flat piece of tile or
flat
porous rock in front of our apparatus and calcine it on our astral
refractory
hearth for a quarter of an hour, then allow the entire focus to fall
thereon
and add to the gold a little nitre whereupon it will melt and become a
deep ruby-red glass, which will be suppurated and will increase by
about
a half again. Then add thereto additional pulverized nitre, and then
extract
the product with alcohol and concentrate the extract and the fused
material
and metallize the same in the usual manner, converting it into a glassy
material by heating (vitrification) so that this gold-containing
glass-like
material will be three times the amount of the gold originally added,
as
we weighed before and allowed to flow together from our refractory
hearth,
will be a homogeneous deep-red liquid, which will cool to a brittle
mass
and this will be one of the particular tinctures. This will now be one
of the thousand parts of silver that has been converted into fine gold.
  </p>
  <p>In a similar process as occurs with gold, so also it takes place
with
all other metals, and the same can occur in the same way with a
glass-like
material to make the tincture as with the gold, depending, however, on
its quality and properties. Even as iron is itself a metal like all
other
metals, no yellow tinge (gold) should be expected with it or with any
other
ordinary metal. </p>
  <p>As long as each one produces only its own kind and in no way
departs
from its own nature, it is necessary then in all things ordained by God
for men to possess by virtue of their nature, without understanding
everything,
for men to make corrections or changes in all things. </p>
  <p>But now, to come to the most universal case of all, and to obtain
for
ourselves by God&#8217;s permissive grace this greatest of all knowledge
(science)
and then also to seek to make it, at least in part, worthy of the
greatest
value, or to make it common knowledge, and this will lead to a very
great
amount of reflection and thought, and will awaken our understanding,
however
great our expectations and our confidence in ourselves, that such
revelations
(evidence) will not be ridiculed nor kept secret, but will have the
necessary
and most widespread circulation and propagation. Seize, therefore, this
great opportunity and take advantage of it, in the Name of all that is
holy, the Three-in-One, the true and eternal God, and write and say, so
that it may become common knowledge, that even to those very great,
though
often distorted mysteries, nothing further will be added, and then,
with
the permissive will and grace of God to make changes in material that
has
been in existence from the beginning of time and still is no different
from the eternal creation of God, through the Holy Spirit, which
provided
this dwelling place there in the elements of the air, and has given
such
peace as now you know and knowledge that such a dwelling place of the
heavens
is the home of the Universal Being, the spirit of our magic we are able
to develop in a natural way, thanks to our common love of God, which
lets
so many celestial things be known to you sinful men. </p>
  <p>Now all of this calls into account your loyalty and sends you out
into
the world with good intentions. Taking our celestial power, i.e., by
using
the Niter, placed in a wide shallow glass container and set in front of
our apparatus containing the magical Fire, and allowing the material to
be calcined by the rays of astral radiation, so that the universal,
solar
essence will be carefully absorbed by its magnetic force and it will
become
very finely powdered and will increase in volume and when it has been
sufficiently
treated in this fashion, it will be further treated with alcohol, then
heated from time to time with salt, and finally subjected to the full
focus
of our natural radiation falling upon it, so that it will melt and be
purified
by the bright sunshine and become absolutely clear, calm and
motionless.
Also, in the same manner, through the great Glory of God and His Holy
Will
the Philosophers&#8217; Stone has allowed you to launch out on this venture
and
to bring it to an end. Then you will know for a certainty that the
marvelous
works of Nature owe more to the Will of God than to our expertise and I
hope that you will make it very clear and very evident that God Himself
brought this about by providing His support for you. Not in this alone,
by giving you such a Stone, but also by laying open before you
everything
above and below the earth, as well as all the Secrets of Nature, the
blessings
of Heaven especially have been bestowed upon you, and always by the way
of certain conspicuous and eternal truths of God which rival the
brilliance
of the Sun and of all the stars, continually and endlessly, in those
smaller
objects which are observed to move and have their being, and which for
you lie in the bosom of God, who has provided all such wonders in
Nature,
even those that are all still hidden from your view and thus are still
secret since unrevealed to you. And they will delight you and make you
rejoice abundantly on so many future occasions, as will all other men
of
the civilized world when they learn that they too will have the power
to
accomplish the same. Know also that God will reveal all this to you
with
such a spirit that you will be able to observe how all-powerful He is,
yes --- and forever even greater than that --- so that in His
omnipotence
and omniscience you will see that God surpasses all earthly knowledge
and
wisdom. Since you then are increasingly aware of you dependence on the
things of God even for this transitory life and you soon maybe taken to
be with God, which you strongly desire and at which time your joy will
be complete. All these and much more are the impressions derived from
the
Philosophers&#8217; Stone (The Stone of Knowledge), and all the best and most
beloved events that befall you are like gold. Those people in humble
circumstances
will not forfeit a holy life nor have to give up that which appears to
be pure gold, whereby a universal tincture can then be made and can
provide
a force able to penetrate all metals and as a result can be responsible
for making the best gold. Moreover, God has also provided this Stone
and
many other blessings like resourcefulness, astuteness, and long life,
along
with additional rewards which have been described in many places, and
give
for the enlightenment of all. Thus, one can say, in all truth, that it
will be all in all, and all in God alone. So be it. </p>
  <p>We will at this time also point out that the content of Potable
Gold
in water is as high as to be obtained anywhere. </p>
  <p>Lay a quintel of gold on a flat piece of tile, and melt the gold
by
our natural process: Fire, and take note! Soon it will begin to flow in
liquid form. Then remove the apparatus, so that there will be
approximately
2 or 3 less times the heat; the support material will now always
involve
a small nucleus of suppurated ordinary sulphur, which after
calcinations
becomes gold, whereupon it will then turn into a bright red color and
will
be very hard, brittle, and friable. This can quite easily be reduced to
a fine powder simply by crumbling with the fingers. This powder is then
weighed and will be found to show a sizeable increase in weight, due in
part to the fact that it has gained in attraction of the Spirit of the
World. Part of it, however, does come from the added weight of the
sulphur
which has been added and must, therefore, be included. Now put this
calcined
gold in a clean glass dish and cover it with a suitable amount of good
wine or brandy, so that it will dissolve in an hour to give a blood-red
solution, if accompanied by vigorous stirring and then set it aside
until
nothing further takes place. Then pour it on a flask and distill it
over,
which is easily carried out by our" Magical Machine" [magnifying lens]
with "reverse distillation fire", which causes the material to be
distilled
over to the last drop and will no longer remain in the form in which it
had been. This is then the potable gold which has been prepared in
dessicated
form and is the spirit of pure gold, having a deep red color, a
characteristic
odor, and a very characteristic sweet taste. For the young, the dosage
is a single drop, for older people, it is 2 drops taken early in the
morning
in strong wine, with a resulting sweating to be expected. In this way
you
will always be able to cure all the internal ailments that are so
detrimental
to health. </p>
  <p>From the beginning, we have introduced those substances we have
taken
from the mineral kingdom and proven to be of universal value, and we
have
already enlightened everybody sufficiently, but now however, we have
added
other substances from the vegetable kingdom to those found in all noble
and base metals, and also all things which live in water (all of which
are noble and of value), and even less than perfect pearls and mother
of
pearl, as well as corals, mussels and various active and inert
substances,
whether crude or elegant, whether crystalline or amorphous (translucent
or opaque), such as now are available and might possibly have been
selected,
all of which belong to the mineral kingdom, or are dependent upon it,
and
for that reason are used as examples. We will consequently point out as
well how even such can be made to be more perfect and more useful by
using
our "magical natural fire" and our natural apparatus, as demonstrated.
What is now of greater use to us, we acknowledge has been given to us
by
the omnipotent hand of God and not alone for the transient kingdoms of
this world, but also in the infinitely longer life to come in the
Kingdom
of Heaven and to enjoy the use of such up until the time we draw our
last
breath and go to be with God. We unfortunately are given His greatest
favor
and therewith our souls receive forgiveness from His Holy Hand and can
be commended to His care. </p>
  <p>Just as we, through the miracle of faith in God and reliance on
His
love, are able to accomplish many wonderful things, and are able to
overcome
all obstacles, so, too, are we able, through the Holy permissive Will
of
God, perform our magic and prepare our natural fire by means of the
apparatus
that we have just now introduced to this world in order to conquer it
by
the highest degree of completeness and perfection which we are able to
accomplish, which would have been impossible without our having
received
the idea of the "natural fire" to help us. Especially since the value
of
such a natural phenomenon could require a thousand or more years to be
adequately demonstrated and further developed, had its worth not been
displayed
through the knowledge of our apparatus. </p>
  <p>Recall now, and cite it yourself, whether you or anyone else has
at
anytime heard or seen how ice, talc, pearls and plumed objects
(especially
since a very strong "materialistic fire" can always be produced) can be
brought into a tree flow or to be melted, without putting over a fire.
As you should know --- and no words of praise are necessary here ---
that
it is reasonable to have this property, that is, to possess our
"natural
fire", apart from which all this would be impossible, as we will show
by
subsequent demonstrations. We will now take, as an example to prove a
point,
a few valuable oriental pearls and place them in an open glass dish in
front of our apparatus, so that the pearls will lie in the "magic
natural
fire", with its focus at the center of the dish. The pearls will be
irradiated
thereby and the effect will instantaneously be indeed marvelous and you
will see how nature in such a short period of time can bring about the
calcinations of the material with complete fusion, accompanied by the
loss
of water, so that there is a sizeable increase in volume of material
which
will itself become more valuable and move, by degrees, into a higher
and
more permanent state as you will soon see. </p>
  <p>At this point, you should know that these pearls were obtained
outside
their natural environment and were also fixed permanently by
vitrification
and produced by bringing many inconceivable celestial bright-shining
colors
to those magnificent gemstones. </p>
  <p>Oh Glorious God! How great and merciful You are and how you
manifest
yourself in so many ways, even to us who are so sinful. Forgive us,
foolish
and unworthy creatures that we are, and show Thy great mercy to all of
us and Thy great goodness to all such as we, according to Thy great
glory,
so that we may love You and praise You. Call us into Thy service, so
that
we may please Thee, for we were created to be Thine. </p>
  <p>Because of the great honor that belongs o You, which You so richly
deserve,
since You are our Master, even as we are Your servants, which as You
have
indeed foreseen and do know, that Your love will serve most of all to
protect
us and be the secure foundation of all that we hold dear, so that even
for many thousands of years hereafter, the entire host of obedient
souls
shall with endless compassion and hope then be able to carry out your
will,
do good to others, seek your blessings in all things, and bewail our
transgressions
of Your law, for You are our Lord God, even in this transitory life,
which
you may choose to prolong by Your undergirding support. </p>
  <p>Now this noblest and altogether beautiful and magnificent stone is
that
which serves as an ornament to all the kings of this world and is the
ornament
of preference because of its greater beauty and indeed, it is
priceless,
since its value exceeds all others beyond measure. </p>
  <p>It is the same stone which God in His excellent goodness and glory
sees
fit to grant long life. </p>
  <p>It is the same stone which is able to cure every day whatever
illnesses
and sorrows there might be. </p>
  <p>It is the same stone which can increase the gratitude of mankind
and
take away all manner of evil. </p>
  <p>It is the stone which can make men feel younger and desire to
produce
new fruit. </p>
  <p>It is the same which can, through the Providential Will of God,
bring
about life where there was death. </p>
  <p>It is the same which enable man to walk with angels and converse
with
spirits. </p>
  <p>Yes, indeed, it is even a manifestation of the secret mysteries of
the
whole world. </p>
  <p>Oh Beautiful Stone! Oh work of angels! Oh, everything good and
perfect,
for which we thank our God and are eternally bound to Him. </p>
  <p>We will, at this point, allow you to indicate how you should value
this
stone, given in such honor and so useful to God, and how you will be
able
to put it to use yourself. </p>
  <p>In the first place, you should give the Lord God all the honor and
glory
and love Hi who has protected you, and rewarded you with gold, although
not merely because of the great love that He has shown for you, so that
you will feel safe and secure and free from the devil and from all
kinds
of spectral apparitions, and will be totally dependent upon Him. He
will
help you to recover from all temporary reverses that occur such as
those
which take place in times of pestilence, and (like an amulet) He will
protect
you completely. Regardless of whether or not such things have already
befallen
you in this life, you cannot be overcome by them and you will again
follow
all safety precautions. I say to you in truth herewith that this stone
which has been revealed is indeed of universal value. </p>
  <p>It follows accordingly that otherwise non-flammable aluminum will
be
covered with a feather-like powder [aluminum oxide]. Where you do not
also
obtain such in crude form from the mountains, as this jewel contains
our
secrets, and yet everybody has evidence of this "natural fire", in just
such a glass dish and wit our apparatus, it can be attempted in such a
way that you will certainly have a very noble gemstone. And if you will
look about, so you will note to what extent the aluminum is still
covered
with the powder (which has a purpose) and what this gemstone will
finally
turn out to be (for indeed it was formed increasingly by our "natural
fire"
with many colored flames and has been given into your powder and you
will
be responsible for it). </p>
  <p>It may indeed prove to be that which came from our true electrum,
from
which, as was earlier reported, the basic tincture for the improvement
of all ordinary and all secret stones comes, wherewith to bring it into
perfection and to its highest quality, which since our universal stone
must offer a hand and provide help, and since the magnitude of this
fire
is found to be small, although in itself it has been able to fix noble
material, as indicated, then you will see a fundamental essence that is
inaccessible in a materialistic fire! Yes indeed, you will see it ---
and
we say to you to examine yourself closely for this nation [Bohemia], in
which we are now writing on this subject, contains one of the greatest
secrets, about which royal secrets more will follow. </p>
  <p>The behavior of the talc in the fire is described quite well. Like
true
artists, we let everyone come before us who can praise the quality of
our
talc after surviving the "materialistic fire" and completely
recovering.
We will point our however, that apart from its astral nature, there can
be no fire of this type. Moreover, this has never happened before.
However,
it is our wish to, and we herewith will do so contradict all
sophisticated
interpretations, therefore, and prove by means of our apparatus and
natural
fire that the talc, like the aluminum powder can be melted and poured
off
after a very short period of time and be converted into a tincture, as
has been demonstrated earlier. This tincture does not undergo further
appreciable
change, and is much like its predecessor, in that a common ordinary
stain
can also be added to it in more or less considerable amounts. We will
now
begin to show how this can be accomplished. This is done by making
significant
tests on the talc oil and noting what its uses are. </p>
  <p>Nor is our true "talc oil" alone in its usefulness. There are also
other
oils which come from metals, minerals, pearls and gemstones which can
be,
should be, and must be brought to completion through no other art than
"our magical fire", which must be used with considerable emphasis on
safety,
by carrying out the reaction in which ordinary mountain talc is put in
the aforementioned glass dish in front of our apparatus, where there
must
also be a calcining fire, so that the material can be calcined until a
blue powder is obtained without any additional smoke, after which the
apparatus
gradually takes up the calcined material after only approximately 2
hours
of digesting over the fire, so it will come to pass and all the world
will
regard it with astonishment to see how strongly the mystery of this
calcined
material with its own ascending spirit frequently draws the spirit of
the
world to itself, resulting in the formation of a highly colored oil and
a gaseous product. However, except on this basis, while its role will
be
maintained, which will establish&nbsp; it, and which will influence the
entire world are questions to be answered. Mark this well! The more a
metal
or mineral is calcined by our magical "natural fire", the more it will
go into solution. The more often it subsequently draws off the spirit
of
the world to itself and dissolves to produce an oil and a gaseous
product
on heating in a strong fire (we know our fire very well), the more it
becomes
coagulated and the greater the degree of fixation (and vitrification),
and the better the results obtained for the health of men, metals and
ordinary
stones, for which God merits eternal praise. </p>
  <p>We will also now subject the vegetable kingdom to our magic of
resolution
by use of "natural fire" and carry out tests by irradiating briefly,
without
relying on fire of an astral nature in anything at all, and to cause
that
which lies in all nature, as established from the beginning by God, as
he ordained. </p>
  <p>Thus, it is a great pity that so many thousands of men, with so
much
money and this world&#8217;s goods, are plagued day and night, for no purpose
at all, and weary themselves in what they endeavor to accomplish with
their
magnificent invention of ways of distributing their wealth --- ways
which
depend on their materialistic fire by digestion, calcinations,
distillation
and many other methods of heating in order to bring in a good return on
investments, according to presumption. However, your wailing is without
end, and were such not maintained, we would be able to demonstrate this
definitely with our "natural fire" (which is entirely and completely
natural)
and can produce light in a very brief period of time, for our astral
process
of natural fire can produce, maintain, increase and bring about
everything
which, on the other hand, impairs, reduces or totally destroys your
"materialistic
fire". As a result it can clearly be seen that little, or even nothing
at all, that is good can result. On the contrary, however, our
naturally
occurring fire, which is nothing else but the blessed sunshine which
leads
to the bringing forth of all things in thousands of different patterns.
  </p>
  <p>We will not consider by what means and in what manner the five
essences
and tinctures of essences can be made and preserved from all vegetable
matter and provide from the very beginning the most valuable white
particles. </p>
  <p>Here it is to be noted that there are two kinds of tinctures
obtained
from vegetables. One gives a greater amount of the same, while the
other
will result in producing better results from the standpoint of health,
and should on the basis of merit and increasing tincture production
become
rather cheap and so preferred by us from the start. </p>
  <p>In the same manner as we have described in the most universal way,
so
we have discovered its nature and qualities. </p>
  <p>Thus, when you take coagulated <i>spiritus mundi</i> (so-called)
and
calcine the same with out natural fire (so designated) up until the
same
turns yellow and continues to remain yellow and then turns red, and
then
remove it according to the type of apparatus you have available, and
the
size of the magical natural fire, as well, so that it will be only
slightly
digested and thus will attract the spirit of the world with incredible
surprise as its very next blood relative in such a manner that it is
strong
of itself, so that in a few short hours it can serve to measure the
whole
blessed world and reflect its spirit. </p>
  <p>When you wish to note it down here, note it carefully, and where
you
do not, it is not given from God for you to do so, then we can do
nothing
further about that here than what we have said in these few remarks, in
which all things and mysteries are concluded and laid to rest, on which
in the final analysis the entire concept depends. Thus, we should so
arrange
our previously disorganized world. The spirit thereof is somewhat
closer
to our magical fire by subsequently thickening, by boiling down, little
by little, until the result obtained is a multi-colored powder (if I
may
be permitted to make recommendations involving the three
characteristics,
then I would suggest the stone which seems whitest to the eye) which is
presently the tincture prepared from vegetable matter and, in what is
to
follow after this, you will find the same should be used. </p>
  <p>If you will now put a small part of the above powder in a large
amount
of fresh water, then it will immediately begin to increase in amount,
so
that the thousandfold increase will be unheard of and never seen before
as the greatest comfort given by a Holy Blessing in the same manner in
which the white particles produce an increase and this also can happen
with all other kinds of scattered seeds. However, all that has been
grown
by planting, cultivating and allowing to reach maturity, and such
growing
results in an increase in the things grown. Furthermore, the roots
should
be covered over by this colored water. </p>
  <p>Now, it is known in every case that God, out of His love for men,
has
created all things for man&#8217;s benefit and such as are created for such
use
and adapted to man&#8217;s need will serve as an example of how all
vegetables
must be treated, through our "natural fire" and all distillations
proceed
through our apparatus, as conceived to take place from the start in our
magical natural fire, which you will understand clearly from the
tabulated
information and the glass apparatus that we build. </p>
  <p>In the first place, the glass was filled with rose petals or other
flower
petals, heaped up, and ten made ready for the reaction by making it or
loading it at the top and placing it in a ring on a mold or on a table
in front of the apparatus and let the "natural fire" do its work
without
reacting too strongly thereon, so that carrying out such an operation
first
involves the idea, and then the fact that the oil level drops in the
glass
or the spirits are eliminated. This is a thousand times more
efficacious
than when such is expressed through the "materialistic fire" and the
ordinary
art of the apothecary. If it is your wish, moreover, to lay out in
further
detail a still greater secret than the above distillation operation,
then
it should be set down here and now. It should include information on
how
tinctures can be made from flowers and other plants. </p>
  <p>If you desire only to make tinctures of increasing amounts of
plants,
then lay them in front of the descending spirit together with its oil
in
an open glass dish and allow our magical fire gradually to irradiate
the
apparatus containing the sample. You will then observe with
considerable
pleasure, how these flowers produce volatile materials along with their
oils by means of which the spirit of this world (i.e., alcohol)
extracts
from it colors which such flowers contain or even developed on its own
as a final product, after evaporation, and then becomes a very
mysterious
secret, which thousands of serious students of the art cannot
understand.
Moreover, through God&#8217;s Holy Will and the wonder and praise which this
inspires, by the addition of a small amount of this tinctured powder to
ordinary fresh water, so this material will be tinctured to the best
rose
color or other colors, which can be prepared from white flowers using
distilled
water, as reported earlier. Subsequently, a Royal Treasure, held in
high
regard as the "White Solomon Seal" has been obtained. </p>
  <p>Should we place our reliance on that, and arrive at a universal
value
resulting from the consequent selection of the best wine made from the
best grapes and describe tinctures of the same, with wide usage as
might
well have been expected, in small doses, then many hundreds of types of
wines can be purchased and sold. </p>
  <p>A single wine, however, drunk only occasionally at most and then
for
health&#8217;s sake and quite agreeable to the body, is poured into a shallow
glass open dish until full and then placed before the apparatus, so
that
the rays of our "natural fire" will be focused without obstruction on
the
wine in such a manner that it will gradually become hot enough to boil.
However, do not let it boil, but gradually reduce the heat by about
half.
Then, add more wine gradually over a period of time until 3 or 4 or
even
more volumes of the hot tincture result. Then, increase the amount of
heat
and let the mixture continue heating an hour longer, still keeping it
liquid,
then increase the heat by about one third more, at which time the
spirit
of the world (that is, the alcohol) will be reduced and coagulation
will
set in. Then push the apparatus aside and let it cool down. You will
then
have formed a gemstone which will have the power to change water into
wine.
In order to give this tincture a higher content of alcohol, you must
place
this tinctured gemstone in an open glass vessel in front of our
apparatus,
using a very gentle natural fire to dissolve it and then in a short
period
of time it will become very fluid, at which point the stone will be
decomposed
completely and be calcined by our fire, so that the alcohol will be
reduced
to about half its original volume and by increasing the concentration
of
the other components in the mixture will become far more fluid so that
now, as the result of the smallest amount of heat from the sun, it
becomes
dissolved in the liquor, which acts more vigorously the closer it is to
our "natural fire", until gradually heating more and more it will
finally
have been converted into a gemstone. </p>
  <p>The amount of tincture obtained by using this stone is 10 times
greater
than that possible when the stone that was prepared in the first
instance
was used. Moreover, using this tincture it is possible to turn water
into
wine, as well as always to improve and lengthen the lifespan of all
mankind
and in this way provide a most useful service, since the more
frequently
such improvements in the lifespan are repeated, the greater the
increase
in riches will become, and for this we should be in the eternal debt of
our gracious Heavenly Father. </p>
  <p>Afterwards, we will search all through the mineral and vegetable
kingdoms
and then to some extent, after sufficient praise to God, we also
observe
wonderful things in the animal kingdom and in carrying out our research
in view of he many possibilities shown by Nature and so many the number
of choices permitted us by God, which we have mentioned herein and have
described to you, we will assert the following: </p>
  <p>Let him be accursed who misuses the greatest gift of God, who has
shown
us grace and mercy, and instead resorts to a diabolical evil. </p>
  <p>Woe unto him also who God has given occasion and permission to
write
down heavenly things and who is known to give unworthy stewardship to
this
opportunity. </p>
  <p>Let him be further accursed and condemned who uses our writings
and
holy wisdom in a special way to further his own interests or to bring
to
himself or others anything other than their use to the Greatest Glory
of
God. </p>
  <p>Let him also be accursed and damned who uses our writings in any
way
that is false, mean or contemptible. </p>
  <p>All of you mark well that such curse will not remain exclusively
on
you. While it concerns itself with the highest majesty of God Himself
and
thus with His Holy Omnipotence, there is nothing that is prescribed in
our art and science that is, outside the permissive Will of God and to
which He has not hitherto given His blessing, so that all things that
we
do have been carried out with the idea of usefulness and tranquility in
mind. </p>
  <p>All of you who thought previously to restrict yourselves to the
animal
kingdom should know at this time that in that kingdom it is of the
least
importance to discover mankind for ourselves and to be unduly
influenced
thereby. </p>
  <p>So set herewith an example and examine yourself to see whether you
will
be given over to an animalistic urge in a philosophy along with the
blessing
of the wisdom anticipated to result from our magical natural fire
proving
to be of value only to a limited degree and for a short time, which
otherwise
might turn out to be of inestimable value to you. </p>
  <p>Nothing that we can say to you, except to tell you about an
imperfect
though very aggressive creature, whom we shall call Homunculus who is
represented
by a small figure involving only a few brutish creatures, originating
outside
of nature and contrary to the Will of God and coming from the Devil
himself,
incarnate in such a profane form and appearing to all mankind as a
ministering
spirit of the time, and spreading everywhere around the idea that he is
concerned with the souls of human beings. For this reason, we concern
ourselves
in this, and on the basis of descriptions of many different homunculus
types, we will open our minds to God&#8217;s permissive Will and dwell upon
useful
thoughts and ascertain what good things in Nature are to be further
achieved. </p>
  <p>Since time immemorial nature has gone by God&#8217;s providential
arrangement,
which includes provisions for you, but through His permissive Will, and
help from our Art and Science, it is possible to shorten the time and
occasion
the birth of ideas and to demonstrate them and subsequently document
them. </p>
  <p>By taking many individual hens, ducks, geese and other poultry and
birds,
taken together as a whole, in a cage or nest made of flax or wool, and
placed in front of our apparatus under our "magical natural fire", as
close
as possible, then the cage or nest will not be set on fire, even after
3 or 4 hours, although this might not be the case after 4 weeks. </p>
  <p>Many wonders are still to be found in the flesh and bones of
mankind
(all of which have been described to some extent), and in his excrement
and urine, and it might well be possible, by means of our "natural
fire",
to be able to come to a preliminary picture thereby of very important,
yet presently very obscure, things and predictions about them as a
result
of the death of certain living creatures, even though the evil of men
and
the tensions resulting therefrom might greatly displease God. Let our
thinking
processes remain on this matter and we will continue to study it. </p>
  <p>It is possible thus, to have good character and at the same time
perform
wonders, even miraculous, deeds. </p>
  <p>No one who is truly blessed likes to boast about his good deeds,
or
set up something sensational about himself or to introduce to the world
some special wonderful thing that he has accomplished, still he has,
however,
attained something worthwhile by using our magical fire, of necessity
however,
in conjunction with the position of the appropriate planets in their
course.
Since, however, it is not uncommon that such events can happen, we will
not place briefly --- but reliably --- before your eyes and give you
full
information about a Magic Mirror, so that you may be able to determine,
among other things, the initial time in which the weight of all 7
metals
can be obtained simultaneously so that the purest one can be selected,
and then one after another selected on the same basis, as well as on
the
strength of their reactivity at that time, determined by melting in an
appropriate glass crucible at the proper hour of the planetary sign in
front of our magical natural fire. </p>
  <p>It is also true that the gold must be melted on a Sunday and under
its
own planetary sign, since the sun itself is considered a reagent, just
as objects are melted when focused in front of our "natural fire". This
is followed by Silver on Monday, since the moon is likewise the reagent
for silver. On Tuesday the same operation is carried out for iron. On
Wednesday,
it is with mercury, Thursday with tin, Friday with copper and Saturday
with lead. </p>
  <p>This is the manner in which the melting process occurs and so each
one
of the metals will be found to follow a weighing sequence which
indicates
that there is a fixed pattern that is constant and can at all times be
subjected to testing, which reduces the upper and lower members of the
series by the same appropriate amount, while the force involved in
every
case is the same, even when the series is rearranged. Thus, in all
these
signs of the sun and of molten objects, whose characteristics show that
they are the result of natural forces and at the same time the result
of
supernatural forces, both of which affect their motion (behavior). </p>
  <p>Consequently, all 7 of these purified metals act in concert on a
Sunday
just before sunrise, making possible a mixture of metals and the
pouring
of them into a previously prepared mold to give a mirror which can be
polished.
The master craftsman responsible for polishing the mirror at no time
examines
it with the naked eye, but at all times wears special eyeglasses, which
provide a sound basis for turning out products of assured value, and
charge
him alone as the guarantor of it serviceability. The same craftsmen
from
the very first moment visually inspects the mirror, inasmuch as he is a
master in his field and this lies in his area of expertise and
everything
that is asked of him and everything that is required of the mirror is,
naturally shown to be valid for such a mirror, when he is demonstrating
it. </p>
  <p>From this apparatus a wonderful magnetic bell can be cast, by
which
an entire army might be summoned or be sent into retreat, and as a
result,
it should be rung or tolerated in such a manner that its frightening
tone
requires considerable force to produce it. From among the 7 metallic
signs,
we will call attention to the following: </p>
  <p>That of all these, or even any one metal by itself with its own
set
of properties, can be made by our own apparatus and natural fire and
must
be cast at the hour of its formation, is both foolish and invalid. Idle
talk about testing must be terminated and must remain our best kept
secret,
so that we can retain it through constant diligence in observance of
God&#8217;s
Will. </p>
  <p>Moreover, in the end, at which time we will complete this life and
return
our spirits to God who gave them to us in the beginning so that we
might
know His eternal and blessed state of peace and be happy to have
attained
to the same. </p>
  <p>We could elaborate further in concluding this work and mention
briefly,
so that only one or two men, or at most three, in any year could
consume
his usual diet, using our natural fire and our apparatus (despite the
fact
that the container might have to have a cover to that the radiation
might
not fall thereon) to heat the material and then enjoy it, and
consequently
obtain a long and rejuvenated life, as well as providing, with God&#8217;s
help,
a happy ending to this life and the assurance of entering Heaven in the
eternal life that is to follow. </p>
  <p>Amen. </p>
