      <p><b>Friederich Gualdi, Gualdo</b> or <b>Gualdus</b> was a
        resident
        of
        Venice in the 1680s or thereabouts. At that time, outer aspects
        not
        giving
        any indications of prosperity, he assisted a nobleman to open
        some
        mines
        and support the operations until they became profitable. The
        nobleman
        suggested
        Gualdus to marry his daughter. However, they came from different
        levels
        of society. This difference posed an insurmountable obstacle. </p>
      <p>Gualdus presented the Republic with sufficient funds (thought
        to
        be
        in gold) to acquire a title of sufficient importance to allow
        the
        marriage
        to take place. The couple lived in a fine villa and Gualdus had
        on
        display,
        many fine paintings that belonged to him. A visitor examining
        one of
        the
        paintings, a portrait of Gualdus, noted it was painted by the
        renowned
        artist, Titian. Gualdus admitted that Titian did indeed paint
        this. The
        problem was, Titian died in 1576! </p>
      <p>Gualdus shortly disappeared, leaving Venice the next morning.
        In
        Compass
        der Weisen (1782), he is referred to as being alive and over 600
        years
        old! Centuries earlier, in Venice, he seemed a man of middle
        age, but
        indicated
        he was much older and the portrait clearly represented him as he
        looked
        more than a century earlier. </p>
      <p>Contained therein, are letters between Gualdus and Baron von
        Reusenstein.
        The latter refers to Gualdus as an Adept and Dr Sigismund
        Bacstrom held
        von Reusenstein in very high regard. We have here, also,
        Gualdus’
        recipe
        for longevity. A subject, it seems, he knew quite a lot about! </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Introduction</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>When the Almighty Creator created man immortal, he planted at
        the
        same
        time the Tree of Life in the center of the earthly paradise, as
        we read
        in the First Book of Moses, so that its fruit should be an
        antidote and
        Universal Medicine for man and serve in all cases of adverse
        happenings.
        But as Adam has deprived us of this benefit by his sin, the only
        thing
        left to man is the desire to live long, which is also considered
        the
        noblest
        among all transitory goods. Just as the Lord God Himself wanting
        to
        prompt
        the children all the more to obedience to their parents, has
        attached
        the
        promise of a long life to the Fourth Commandment (in the Fourth
        Book of
        Moses): So that you may live long and prosper on earth. </p>
      <p>Even so, we must not think of achieving immortality through the
        Universal
        Medicine as we could have done through the fruits of the Tree of
        Life.
        Thus there are among all men only two, Enoch and Elias, who did
        not die
        but, as the Scripture relates, were transported into Paradise,
        although
        some believe, yes, the Apostles themselves, that the identical
        privilege
        of not tasting death had been promised to St John, Christ’s
        favorite
        disciple,
        in the words found in his Gospel, where the Saviour replies to
        Peter:
        If
        I wish that he (St John) should stay here till I return, of what
        concern
        is that to you? To say it briefly: There is no one weary of
        life, but
        everyone
        is eager to see how he can add to his years. This is a gift
        which we
        can
        hope to obtain through the Universal medicine, whose power
        extends over
        the three natural realms: animal, vegetable, and mineral. Galen
        has
        given
        us a fine example of maintaining one’s life a long time, by
        doing it
        himself
        for 140 years without ever suffering any indisposition, as he
        reports
        in
        his book on the art of living a long life. </p>
      <p>Because the desire to live long and healthy is naturally common
        to
        all,
        many a man will undoubtedly remember and ask me what I think of
        that
        man
        of whom the Dutch newspaper wrote and assured us that he Had
        passed
        through
        Venice and had there stated unquestionably the he had really
        reached
        400
        years of age. Now one could rightly ask me if this was due to
        the
        Universal
        Medicine which keeps the Humidum Radicale (radical moisture) and
        the
        natural
        warmth in perfect balance, counteracts the debilities of old
        age, and
        frequently
        rejuvenates man. To this I will give my answer in Part 3. </p>
      <p>In Part I, I will show that individuals at all times existed
        who
        had
        been living for a few centuries. In the second I will speak
        about
        things
        that are both within and without us human beings and may
        contribute
        toward
        extending our lifespan. In the third part I will give some
        useful and
        curious
        observations concerning the Universal Medicine and its
        preparation. </p>
      <p>Although we are born to die and Tertullian says that God did
        not
        make
        man mortal after the Fall through anger but through great
        compassion,
        the
        Holy Scripture nevertheless shows us that in general man reached
        700
        years
        before the Fall. Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912, Cain
        for 910,
        and thus the lifespan was decreased by and by, till God fixed it
        at 120
        ordinary years after the Fall. Nevertheless, Arphaxad, who was
        born 200
        years after the Flood, lived for 300 years and his son Salem for
        430.
        Heber,
        a son of Salem’s from whom the Hebrews have their name, lived
        for 465
        years. </p>
      <p>But here one might think that these years were not like our
        years
        and
        were not solar buyt lunar years of 29 to 30 days, or that every
        season
        constituted a year, as was the case with the Chaldeans and
        Arcadians,
        according
        to the report of Lactantius. Or at most they might not have been
        more
        than
        the time when the sun passes from one tropic to another, so
        that,
        calculated
        against our years, theirs were only half as long. However, they
        could
        not
        have been lunar years, as otherwise the consequence would be
        that many
        persons of our present time were living longer than our
        forefathers,
        when
        100 of our years would make 1200 lunar years. At least, those
        years
        consisted
        of 12 months, because Moses says in Book 7:2, speaking of the
        Flood,
        that
        Noah was 600 years old when the Flood occurred on the 17th day
        of the
        second
        Moon; and in Chapter 8:4, he says that the Ark rested on a
        mountain in
        Armenia on the 27th day of the 7th month; and that the peaks of
        the
        high
        mountains began to appear in the water on the first day of the
        6th
        month.
        In addition he says in the 13th verse that Noh opened the Ark on
        the
        first
        day of the first month in his 600th year. From this it is
        evident that
        Moses counted the years in 12 months, and even if there were a
        difference
        in the calculation of the months according to our year and
        months, it
        would
        not amount to more than 12 days. </p>
      <p>Relating to secular history, Homer informs us that Prince
        Nestor,
        son
        of Neli, was nearly 300 years old when he came to the aid of the
        Greeks
        against the Trojans. Anacreon assures us that Arganthemius, king
        of the
        Tartessos was 150 years; Cinirus, king of Cyprus, lived to 100
        years;
        and
        Aeginius, to 200 years. Petrus Maffeus, in his Indian history,
        testified
        that in Bengal an ordinary an was found, who had neither science
        nor
        erudition,
        who was 355 years old, and as proof thereof he related
        everything from
        memory that had happened in his lifetime, and which was quite in
        accord
        with the chronicles. </p>
      <p>The great Seneca, a Spaniard by birth, reached 44 years of age
        and
        would
        without doubt have become much older if his cruel and unjust
        disciple
        Nero
        had not cut the thread of his life. Under the Emperor Trajan,
        Simon
        Cleophe,
        Bishop of Jerusalem, was crucified at the age of 120 years old;
        St
        Anthony,
        Bishop of Egypt was 150; and Cronius, his collaborator, 155.
        Emperor
        Claudius,
        after sufficiently examining the age of the Bolognese Titus
        Fullonius,
        finally found that he had been 150 years old. The Hun King
        Attila died
        in the 124th year of his life. Petrus de Natalibus asserts that
        St
        Severinus,
        Bishop of Tongres, reached 375 years of age and was ordained
        Bishop in
        his 197th year. Nicolaus de Comitatibus certifies that among the
        Bracmanniers
        there had been one of 300 years. </p>
      <p>It is also easy for Nature to give to one man alone so many
        years
        as
        she might otherwise gives to many together, just as she bestows
        on a
        giant
        so much strength and matter as would at other times be required
        for the
        formation of many human bodies. Such a one was a man of the
        lineage of
        Turgan, not far from Lake Constance, who fought against the
        Saxons
        under
        Charlemagne. He impaled eight of them on his pike, carried them
        over
        his
        shoulder and walked through the Rhine with them to his comrades,
        saying:
        Look here the German frogs that I have caught; I cannot
        understand
        their
        croaking. </p>
      <p>Guido Bonatus assures us that in 1223 he knew someone by the
        name
        of
        Richard, who was already 400 years old and could undeniably
        prove that
        he had seen service under Charlemagne. In addition, there is
        also much
        talk about a certain Jean du Temps who served in the war under
        Charlemagne
        and died under Louis VII in the year 1146. From this we may
        conclude
        that
        he must have lived close to 360 years, as Charlemagne had
        already been
        crowned Emperor in the year 800. </p>
      <p>A certain Englishman was 152 years old, And just as I do not
        report
        anything without good reason, I also say here that the learned
        Monsieur
        Hubin, Royal French Treasurer, had given me that man’s portrait,
        which
        he had received from M. Jacques du Perron, nephew of the
        Cardinal of
        the
        same name, Bishop of Angouleme and subsequently Euvreux, where
        he died
        as Chief Almoner of the daughter of the King of England, Henry
        IV. </p>
      <p>That Englishman was rather tall and heavy, and his name was
        Thomas
        Parck,
        of Winningthon, parish of Alverburg, County of Shropshire. He
        was born
        in 1433 and had already 152 years when he was put before King
        Charles I
        in England on 9 October 1635. He had seen nine Kings on the
        English
        throne:
        Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth, James
        VI, and
        Charles I, father of the present ruling King. The good man
        praised God
        among other things also for the fact that he had always
        steadfastly
        adhered
        to the Roman Catholic religion, although he had seen three
        changes in
        religion
        during his lifetime, under Henry VIII, Queen Mary Tudor, and
        then again
        under Elizabeth. He readily confessed that he had been put on
        trial in
        his 100th year because he had got a young girl with child. This
        was
        also
        the reason why, after the customs of the country, he had to
        stand in
        front
        of the church door, covered with a white cloth and holding a wax
        candle
        in his hand, thus obviously doing penance. Sixteen years before
        his
        death
        he lost his sight. He died in London on 24 November 1635, within
        half
        an
        hour, without having been sich before or noticing the
        approaching
        death.
        After his death, his body was opened and all his inner parts
        were found
        to be healthy, except his lung which was full of hardened blood.
        The
        physicians
        attributed this to a change of air, as he had been brought to
        his place
        of death from a locality where the air had been much purer and
        milder
        than
        in London. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the Countess of Arundel presented to the
        Queen
        of
        England a midwife who was 123 years old and still performed her
        duties
        in her home town two years before. </p>
      <p>Olaus Magnus relates in his historical accounts that an English
        Bishop
        by name of David reached 170 years. Buchanan asserts that
        Laurence
        Hutland
        was still preaching in his 140th year, even in the severest of
        winters. </p>
      <p>It is therefore evident from the ecclesiastical and temporal
        history
        that at all times the life of some persons lasted for a hundred
        years
        and
        that it has not always been so precisely limited to 60 and 80
        years as
        it is said in the Psalms of David. Solomon also says that God
        did not
        make
        death, which signified nothing but a mere name without essence
        and only
        the absence of life. The said wise King also says that old age
        is a
        crown
        of honor and that grey hair is worth esteeming, because those
        who have
        it are generally useful and necessary to the community on
        account of
        their
        long experience. </p>
      <p>Now we will also show which things that are outside of us and
        how
        many
        of them, such as the place of residence, purity of the air and
        water,
        etc.,
        contribute to the preservation of health and the prolongation of
        life.
        It is rightly said that the dead are the best teachers because
        they
        teach
        us in their works without flattery and self-interest, as the
        following
        epitaph informs us in regard to longevity: Continence and
        Frugality
        Prolong
        Our Lifespan, </p>
      <p>The great Pythagorean Appolonius of Tyana retained his youth
        for
        over
        100 years by his continence and frugality, which also caused the
        ancient
        anchorites to extend their lifespan and health so far. Due
        precisely to
        continence and frugality, the great philosopher Democritus also
        enjoyed
        the best health for 109 years. And it is worth remembering
        what&nbsp;
        Diogenes
        Laertius thinks of his death: His sister having indicated that
        she
        could
        not attend the festivities of the goddess Ceres if he died
        before them,
        he complied and sustained himself during his last three days of
        life
        with
        the smell of warm bread. The true celibate and chaste state is
        indeed
        an
        excellent means for living long and healthy. </p>
      <p>But Artaxerxes, King of Persia, who begot 115 children, ended
        his
        life
        only after 100 years, due solely to the conspiration of fifty of
        his
        children.
        The Roman Emperor Proclus once boasted that a hundred Polish
        girls had
        given birth to 100 of his children within two weeks. </p>
      <p>In such a way, at the time of St Jerome, a Roman man could have
        had
        a legion of legitimate children with a Roman lady, according toe
        an
        account
        of this Church Father who lived at the time of Pope Damasu. In
        Rome
        there
        lived a man who had already become a widower twenty times. He
        had
        married
        a widow who, in turn, had already 20 husbands. When she died, he
        attended
        the corpse with a laurel wreath on his head and a palm branch in
        his
        hand,
        under the great cheers of other men, which they uttered because
        he had
        survived his otherwise incomparable wife. </p>
      <p>Moderation and physical exercise also make us healthy and
        strong.
        This
        is why the Romans were extremely amazed at the strength and
        giant size
        of our Gauls, who did not drink wine and for a long time knew
        nothing
        about
        it, until the Swiss Helicon first brought the vine and its juice
        to
        Gaul.
        Likewise, the kind of food we eat contributes a great deal to a
        long
        life.
        People in the Province of Limoges mostly eat nothing but
        chestnuts and
        live for a very long time, because they get from them
        nourishment that
        is little subject to corruption and thus does not easily
        dissipate. </p>
      <p>A good constitution and the right temperature of the radical
        moisture
        and the natural warmth are necessary for a long life. The
        superfluous
        moisture
        tones the warmth down; and frequent warmth in turn tones down
        the
        moisture.
        That is why a long life can be expected of a sanguine
        constitution, as
        the blood is then warm and moist. The aggressive and ever active
        fire
        of
        the choleric constitution cannot last long in a dry person. The
        great
        moisture
        of the phlegmatic cannot sufficiently cook the natural warmth;
        and the
        melancholic is all too dry and cold. But it may well be that
        when the
        choleric
        and the phlegmatic constitutions are combined, and one tempers
        the
        other’s
        faults, they make for a long life. This also happens with the
        sanguine
        and melancholic, when the warmth and moisture of the blood is
        tempered
        by the dryness of the melancholic and can likewise give a long
        life. </p>
      <p>In addition, a healthy place of residence contributes not a
        little
        to
        a long life. When Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had a
        census made
        of all of Italy, four men were found in a town of Vellajacum,
        region of
        Piacenza, who were each 210 years old, and still six other men
        each 110
        years. At the same time, there lived in Arimini a woman by name
        of
        Tertulla
        who was 137 years old. Likewise another in Faventia in her 132nd
        year.
        Pliny relates from the Isigon that in India the Cirneses
        generally live
        to 140 years. Pomponius Mela reports that the residents of a
        town
        situated
        at the foot of Mount Atlas live twice as long as other
        inhabitants of
        the
        globe. And Orisicrates asserts that there are Indians in the
        tropics
        who
        are as tall as five elbows and live to 130 without debilitating
        old
        age.
        Ctesias likewise avers that those who lived in Pandoria in the
        valleys
        generally reached 200 years, and they had this odd
        characteristic that
        they had white and grey hair in their youth but black hair in
        old age. </p>
      <p>Helanicus writes that in the region of Etolia the inhabitants
        usually
        became 200 years old. Among them, Pictoreus reached 300 years,
        according
        to a report by Damasus. If Ephorus is to be believed, the
        Arcadian King
        lived for 300 years. And Alexander Cornelius says that in
        Illyria a
        certain
        Dandon extended his life to 500 years. But in his Periplus
        Xenophon
        goes
        even further, saying that the Maritime King lived for 600 years
        and his
        son for 800. </p>
      <p>Olaus Magnus writes in the 4th book of his Histories that the
        people
        of the coldest midnight countries usually live to 160 years of
        age; and
        in his 12th book he says that the inhabitants of Iceland reach
        more
        than
        100 years. </p>
      <p>In his <i>Historia Naturali</i>, Nierembergius asserts that
        the
        people
        living in the Jucantic mountains became quite old. And in the
        region of
        Versin in Brazil, as is testified to by Antonius Pipafelta,
        people very
        often reach 140 years. According to a report by Ludovic Bartama
        the age
        of 100 years is quite common in blessed Arabia. </p>
      <p>In the Auvergne it often happens that fathers see the children
        of
        their
        grandchildren, and I have read somewhere that in our Alps a
        single man
        was the head and progenitor of a whole village which had more
        than a
        hundred
        households, all stemmed from him. Finally, in the year 1660
        traveled
        from
        Ternant towards Orange, together with the Marquis of St Andre
        Montbrun,
        Captain General of the Royal Army, because of some affairs
        concerning
        the
        Count de Dona, and I went to an inn at Allieres, a few hours
        from
        Lyons.
        It so happened that our host and hostess, both healthy and full
        of
        vigor,
        had each in fact lived for 104 years. </p>
      <p>In the previous discourse I have sufficiently shown by examples
        from
        the ecclesiastical and temporal history that there have at all
        times of
        the world been persons who lived for several hundred years. From
        this
        is
        it very easy to conclude that it is not impossible for us to
        live just
        a s long as they did, and that the story of Friedericus Gualdus,
        who
        was
        400 years old, is no fiction. About this, I will now also bring
        here a
        literal extract from the Dutch newspaper of April 3, 1687. </p>
      <p>Extract from a Letter from Venice of March 7, 1688: "Three
        months
        ago,
        a man by the name of Frederico Gualdo left here, who is 400
        years old.
        He carried with him his portrait which had been made by Titian,
        already
        dead for 130 years! From this we may conclude that this man has
        had the
        true Universal Medicine, whereby he was able to keep himself
        healthy
        for
        such a long time. This is no fiction, however, but there are
        here many
        credible witnesses who spoke with this man himself, and who left
        here
        for
        no other reason that that it was said of him that he possessed
        the true
        secret of the Universal Medicine. The lovers of great
        curiosities will
        investigate this matter and inform us of the result, so that we
        can
        thereby
        also be useful to the public." </p>
      <p>For my part I say that this Friederico Gualdo could reach such
        a
        great
        age wither without any medicine and solely through a
        well-regulated
        life
        and moderate physical exercise, and perspiration, or also
        through the
        Universal
        Medicine. Among all sayings, this Latin one is one of the
        truest: <i>Plures
          gula occidit quam gladius</i>. Reveling and immoderate eating
        and
        drinking
        strangle more people than the sword. Therefore I first begin
        with
        prescribing
        a rule of life for those who wish to live long and stay healthy.
        But I
        also want them to have a healthy body, and in the healthy body
        there
        should
        dwell a healthy or rational soul and spirit. They have to be of
        cheerful
        disposition and not subject to excessive emotions. Now follows
        what a
        person
        with the above characteristics has to observe. </p>
      <p>First, he must guard against eating variously oddly cooked hard
        dishes
        and imbibing various drinks. Then he must well chew his food
        with his
        teeth,
        as that is the first digestive preparation which is effected by
        the
        moisture
        from the saliva of the glands of the jaw. When man is at table,
        he must
        eat the food and fruit alternately, so that moist and dry, fat
        and
        lean,
        sour after sweet, and cold things after warm ones, and vice
        versa are
        mixed
        together. For in this way the excess of the quality of one kind
        of food
        is always corrected by its contrary. </p>
      <p>When a man has had a good drink or eaten fruit, he should eat
        dry
        bread
        afterwards. To counteract the too much wine he has taken, he can
        eat
        something
        acid or drink some lemon juice, which immediately gets rid of
        belching.
        The latter generally occurs after a meal, either due to all too
        much
        eating
        or even to great emptiness. Should he still be overheated from
        the
        wine,
        he can use cooling things but never additional heating ones,
        which
        could
        easily cause a high temperature. The strongly distilled spirits
        serve
        only
        to strengthen the stomach and promote digestion when one has
        eaten a
        bit
        too much; but if one gets hot from too much drinking, they are
        very
        harmful
        and dangerous. Aside from that, those distilled spirits are an
        excellent
        external and topical remedy. However, it should also be noted
        that
        after
        the use o this kind of beverage had been introduced into
        America, those
        peoples did and are doing quite a bit toward the shortening of
        their
        long
        life, just like ourselves. </p>
      <p>As far as exercising the body is concerned, a man must never do
        violence
        to himself, unless necessity requires it, yet always according
        to the
        maxi:
        Ad ruborem, non as sudorem. Until you get warm, but not so much
        that
        you
        sweat, so that only the natural warmth is roused and the pores
        are
        opened,
        enabling Nature to cleanse herself through perspiration. </p>
      <p>When a man has become quite hot and is tormented by thirst, he
        must
        not go to any cold place. He must stay put without making any
        movements,
        must bare his stomach or throw off his wig, but have a drink. He
        should
        drink wine rather than water, which could cause pleuralgia due
        to its
        coldness.
        But if he happens to be I the fields where he cannot have any
        wine, and
        he can no longer bear his thirst, he must drink by drops and not
        swallow
        in big gulps. </p>
      <p>When getting out of bed, one must not immediately stand at or
        under
        the window, or go out into the cold air, because every quick
        change is
        dangerous: Juxta Hippocrates: <i>Omnis repentina mutatio est
          periculosa</i>. </p>
      <p>When in a cold winter the nose, hands and feet are like frozen,
        one
        must be very careful not to put them quickly near the fire or
        stove, or
        dip them into warm water, because the members cannot without
        danger
        tolerate
        a change from one extremity of quality to another. It would be
        better
        to
        go into a heated room or a stable and thus get gradually warm by
        good
        movements,
        while simultaneously calling the escaped natural warmth back by
        means
        of
        the external tempered one. During my travels I used to moisten
        my socks
        of common linen in brandy every morning and took care to keep my
        boots
        wide enough to allow the blood in my feet to circulate freely
        right
        into
        my toes, which I always frequently moved. Aside from this, it is
        also
        customary
        to rub completely numb member with snow or ice-cold water and to
        move
        them
        well. Thus they will gradually recover without any danger. </p>
      <p>When the time of the new fruit arrives, you must first eat but
        little
        of it, to allow the stomach to get used to t by and by and you
        do not
        have
        to worry that the intake of too much new fruit will cause
        fermentation
        of the gastric juice, resulting in many kinds of fevers.
        However, I do
        not wish to deny that there are some kinds of fruit which can be
        eaten
        without hesitation, as they do not produce much juice that
        hinders
        nutrition,
        and pass through easily. </p>
      <p>Likewise, it is often said that a dangerous illness generally
        follows
        a quick change in the manner of living, to which travelers are
        especially
        subject. </p>
      <p>Whoever does not share the views of Pythagoras regarding
        drinking,
        should
        resort to wine for a healthy and long life. Among different
        kinds of
        water
        the best is that which is light and totally without smell or
        taste. It
        is Emperor Nero whom we have to thank for this discovery.
        Drinking
        water
        that has been purified by distillation and then made fresh again
        with
        ice
        immediately kills any nests of worms produced in the stomach.
        And with
        such water the learned Perreault, a member of the Royal Academy,
        cured
        a nun as if by a miracle. </p>
      <p>Insomuch as sleep is a necessary part of life and a model of
        death,
        it should be sweet and calm. You must not only slumber but also
        relax
        your
        thoughts, as Apollonius of Tyana said to Phraotes, King in
        India. That,
        however, is impossible for those who drink a lot of wine, as
        its’
        rising
        vapors always move and change the species of the imagination.
        That is
        why
        those sleepers are completely tired on awakening. Instead, those
        who
        drink
        much water (I speak from personal experience) sleep much better
        and
        sweeter,
        and their thoughts are so calm that they also comprehend all
        things in
        their true nature and form during sleep. Their sleep is neither
        light
        nor
        heavy, nor disturbed by bad dreams. </p>
      <p>Therefore Apollonius says in Chapter 2 of his life by
        Philostratus
        that
        the idolatrous priests of the Amphiaraus ordered those who came
        to
        their
        temple in Athens tormented by dreams, to abstain from wine for
        three
        days,
        whereby their dreams became much purer and clearer toward
        morning, so
        that
        they imagined having received them through divine inspiration
        and
        demanded
        an interpretation of them. </p>
      <p>Irrespective of this, it is certain that if a man takes a glass
        of
        wine
        before resting and puts his head down, the wine may well move
        the
        species
        of his imagination by its vapors, while his mind is ever
        diverted from
        strong concentration on one thing, and in that way sleep is
        induced.
        This
        is well proven by the example of the famous Minister of State
        Tellier,
        Chancellor of France. In 1660, when he was overheated from the
        spiced
        Lenten
        fare and exhausted from much business, he used this means to get
        some
        sleep
        during his frequent travels to and from Avignon on business. </p>
      <p>The physicians, in their Ars Longa, their Long Art --- which
        often
        makes
        for a short life --- stress three points in particular, which
        they call
        Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Cure. By means of the first they try
        to
        recognize
        the origin, cause and seat of the illness. Through the
        Prognostic and
        Cure
        they often prescribe remedies which produce a totally contrary
        effect
        to
        their intention. However, we cannot do otherwise, we must use
        physicians
        and their remedies, as the Scripture says: Honor the medical
        doctor
        because
        he helps you in need. But here we must use the shorter way of
        retaining
        our life for a long time, against the Long Art of Hippocrates,
        for
        whoever
        controls the beginning has won everything, as the poet says: </p>
      <p><i>Principiis obsta, sero Medicina paratur,</i> <br>
        <i>Dum mala per longes invaluere moras.</i> </p>
      <p>Regarding the Diagnostic, we have to pay careful attention to
        anything
        new or unusual we feel, but it in the midst of our rest, or when
        we are
        about to rest, or when we are going about our business. </p>
      <p>In addition, we must also carefully observe if any change
        occurs
        in
        the evening after work or when getting up in the morning. In the
        latter
        case there is more cause for worry as there is generally more
        strength
        and health after sleep and rest, through which our physical
        forces are
        renewed. In do doing, we must note is there is heaviness and
        tiredness
        of the members and if the appetite has been completely lost. </p>
      <p>When now we feel weak and exhausted after ordinary work, I say
        that
        the numbness and heaviness of the members is due to all too much
        gastric
        juice, which is found in the viscera of all members and cannot
        be
        eliminated
        better than through perspiration and sweat. It can be produced
        by
        assisting
        the inner natural warmth with the external, and it is certain
        that,
        done
        in time, it prevents many an illness. </p>
      <p>The art of sweating, however, consists in lying on your back,
        well
        tucked
        in between two white linen sheets and two eiderdowns, filly
        covered up,
        with only your face showing uncovered outside. You must not come
        out of
        this warmth until you have profusely perspired. After sweating,
        you
        must
        not get out of bed immediately but only half an hour afterwards.
        If you
        continue doing this for several consecutive days, your appetite
        and
        strength
        will return gradually, causing you to feel fine, fit and light
        in all
        members.
        For through this sweating the viscera are cleansed of all
        superfluousness,
        without pain or detriment to Nature. This cannot be done by any
        medicine
        unless it be the Universal medicine, which we will soon teach. </p>
      <p>Therefore, for our health we can undertake this sweating three
        times
        a year, in the spring, fall and winter. When there is a lack of
        appetite
        in the spring or fall, we must eat little when sitting at table
        and do
        more vigorous physical exercise. But if the appetite has been
        completely
        lost, so that the mere sight of food causes aversion, we must
        not eat
        anything
        for 24 hours, take a long walk, and help the natural warmth in
        this
        way. </p>
      <p>We must eat only small amounts of food that contains much
        gastric
        juice
        or which is very nutritious, as an excess of gastric juice
        generally
        causes
        fevers and in children, the falling sickness, epilepsy. Only
        those are
        cured who get rid of the excess of this gastric juice with
        frequent
        vomiting. </p>
      <p>Fever causes strong fermentation coupled with an increase of
        the
        blood
        in both young and old, even if they are accustomed to leading a
        dietetic
        and regulated life. For as soon as they eat a bit too much,
        their head
        becomes heavy, which is often a sign and forerunner of a stroke.
        The
        reason
        is that the fast and strong increase of the gastric juice causes
        the
        blood
        to be frequently and forcefully pushed to the brain where it
        tears the
        small and subtle veins, thereafter spreads within the brain and
        presses
        the nerves together. This hinders the circulation of the vital
        spirits
        where, as Ferrelius says, the natural warmth dwells.
        Interference with
        their circulation can cause death if help does not come in due
        time
        through
        the opening of a vein or through sweating. Consequently, through
        the
        former
        the cause ir removed but through the latter the cerebral veins
        are
        softened,
        to enable them to gradually expand and stretch again without
        danger of
        tearing. </p>
      <p>As soon as we notice an indisposition, we must not lose any
        time
        and
        immediately use the remedies, thus preventing a long illness
        which
        might
        otherwise ensue. At the same time, we must think of the air we
        breath
        and
        the food we eat, and according to their quality and in
        consideration of
        our natural warmth decide which air and which food are most
        suitable to
        us, and in what way we can best help the natural warmth and
        drive the
        cause
        of the illness out of the inmost parts of our body. </p>
      <p>For the sake of this cause, calm and warm air is to be chosen,
        that
        does not carry any repulsive smell. Places that are all too much
        subject
        to the winds are often not healthy, although all too warm places
        and
        those
        where the air is full of bad vapors require the wind to cleanse
        and
        refresh
        them, As is usually said about the city of Avignon: When in
        Avignon is
        not constantly windy, Morbona (illness) reigns there with its
        servants. </p>
      <p>I have shown in my treatise entitle <i>L’Homme Artificiel ou
          le
          Prophete
          Physique</i> (<i>The Artificial Man or the Natural Prophet</i>),
        how
        very
        necessary it is for our health to understand the condition of
        the wind
        and the air, as in the view of Vitruyi, in Chapter 6 of his
        first book
        on architecture, the noon winds can cause incurable diseases,
        such as
        coughs,
        tuberculosis, diseases of the nerves and members, must as the
        residents
        of the town of Meteline, on the island of the same name, are
        best
        refreshed
        by the midnight winds. </p>
      <p>In those who are wounded it is easy to observe that the pain of
        the
        wounds flares up and they become more sensitive with strong
        winds,
        because
        the external air causes the inner wounds between the skin and
        the flesh
        to be felt and hurt, due to its penetrating circulation. </p>
      <p>When the illness is of long duration, the patient must be
        carried
        from
        his room into another. Then the windows of the previous room
        must be
        opened,
        fresh water must be sprayed about, after which the patient can
        be
        brought
        there. For the same reason careful Nature also frequently gives
        the
        patient
        the desire to change the air and location, which he should not
        be
        denied. </p>
      <p>As the patient gradually recovers, he generally has a desire
        for
        eating
        something acid, which is then very healthy for him, provided it
        is done
        sparingly and carefully, because Nature arouses an appetite for
        that
        which
        is right for her. This is so true that very often patients find
        their
        recovery
        through a moderate use of that which the medical doctor forbade
        so
        earnestly. </p>
      <p>To say it briefly, diet and sweating are a part of the
        Universal
        Medicine,
        for Nature should in everything be our teacher from whom we must
        learn
        the right and true means for living healthy and long. </p>
      <p>Because in childhood there is much heat, it throws off, by
        means
        of
        the smallpox and the so-called red needle-rash, whatever
        corrupted
        gastric
        juice and other impure matter there is in the body. When then
        that
        natural
        warmth has been decreased, we must stimulate it again, so that
        it may
        accomplish
        its effect just as it does in older persons. </p>
      <p>Dancing, ball games, hunting, military, and other exercises
        arouse
        the
        natural warmth to do it share and drive out everything
        superfluous from
        the body through perspiration. </p>
      <p>That is also the reason why farmers keep their health and live
        long
        is because they are continually working. As they do not make any
        debaucheries
        As they do not make any debaucheries, they do not know anything
        of
        podagra;
        which causes Seneca to say in Chapter 1, of his <i>Hyppolitus</i>:
        Only
        in rich Houses does podagra like to dwell. </p>
      <p>For podagra in general avoids women and poor people and instead
        makes
        itself at home in palaces and rich houses where many good
        morsels are
        enjoyed.
        Therefore it has always been true that no hard working
        individual has
        ever
        had occasion to complain like Herod, who says: When I should
        eat, have
        no hands. When I should walk, I have no feet, but when I am
        supposed to
        have pain, I have hands and feet. </p>
      <p>Just as every quick change is dangerous, lean persons who are
        putting
        on fat have serious grounds for preventing podagra through
        sweating. </p>
      <p>Consumption, colic, and dropsy are cured with sweating. Whoever
        contracts
        the plague, and Nature has already pushed out some plague
        glands, can
        infallibly
        be freed from it through sweating. I can say precisely the same
        of
        leprosy,
        for if the natural warmth is sufficiently helped, it will
        completely
        throw
        out all superfluous and impure matters. Therefore those who have
        smallpox
        or the red-needle rash are rightly kept warm, and the natural
        warmth is
        aided with a confection of hyacinth, alkermes, or theriac
        (treacle).
        Gout
        itself, even if one no longer speaks about it, is cured by
        frequent
        sweating.
        Likewise the stroke, provided one starts early with
        bloodletting. </p>
      <p>Just the same must be done for the trembling and shaking of the
        cerebral
        veins have ruptured. The blood has run out of them and it
        presses on
        the
        beginning of the nerves, thus granting the vital spirits their
        influence
        only intermittently. The only remedy is a good diet and
        sweating, as
        the
        serious blood that has run out thereby consumes itself. I have
        seen how
        some members suffering from a painful discharge were cured by
        putting
        them
        for a few hours in the hottest summer sun. </p>
      <p>The best food for a sick person is good meat that can easily be
        digested.
        In fact, when it is cut into small pieces and the soft bones are
        minced
        quite finely together with the marrow, then pounded in a marble
        mortar,
        you must add to it something that has been found advisable, that
        keeps
        the patient’s body open and is pleasant to his taste, sour,
        sweet, or
        the
        like, according to his appetite, then cook it over a moderate
        fire.
        After
        that, everything is strained through a cloth and you will have,
        as it
        may
        be called, the quintessence of what a patient is allowed to eat,
        also
        his
        beverage, according to whether he wanted it thick or liquid. </p>
      <p>I am referring to those who wish to keep the volatile salt of
        the
        meat
        in the broth to the book De la Machine de Monsieur Papi pour
        Amolin les
        Os. There they will find my report, which I added in order to
        achieve
        the
        thing more easily. It has been printed in Paris by Michaler. Now
        I will
        also speak of the easy and sure way of preparing the Universal
        Medicine. </p>
      <p>As we learn from the preacher Solomon that all recovery comes
        from
        God
        and that He causes the medicine to grow out of the earth
        (Altissimus
        creavit
        de terra Medicina), it is not necessary to ask here from whom
        this
        medicine
        has come down to us. Little do we care whether it has derived
        from the
        Hebrew Cabala or from the famous Dr Apollonius, or from his son
        Aesclepius,
        or from Hermes Trismegistus, from Raymond Lully, Arnbold de
        Villanova,
        from Bacon, from the Cosmopolitan, or from a Brother of the
        Rosicrucians.
        Suffice it to say that its composition is easy and of small
        cost, and
        that
        its effect is certain and assured, so that we could believe that
        it has
        the power to rejuvenate. This would appear to be irrational, if
        we had
        no certain an absolutely true evidence of rejuvenation both in
        the Holy
        Scripture and in secular history. The Royal Prophet, in Psalm
        1-2: 5,
        attests
        to the certainty of the matter in two sentences. First, that the
        eagle
        becomes young again, and secondly, that just as the eagle’s our
        youth
        can
        be renewed and brought back: <i>Renovabitur ut aquila juventus
          tue</i>. </p>
      <p>All Church Fathers believe that the eagle becomes young again,
        but
        they
        are not of the same opinion concerning the way in which it is
        done. In
        his interpretation of this Psalm, St Augustine says that when
        the eagle
        becomes old, the upper part of its beak becomes so crooked that
        it can
        eat with no food with it, or very little. Therefore it would
        crooked
        that
        it can eat no food with it, or very little. Therefore it would
        lose its
        strength and become weak due to dieting all too long. But if it
        were to
        whet off its said crooked beak on a stone and shed it, it could
        again
        eat
        sufficiently, getting new strength as if it had been completely
        rejuvenated.
        The Prophet Isaiah speaks of this rejuvenation of the eagle in
        Chapter
        40:31, and Hiob in Chapter 39:25. mention of it is also made by
        Aldrovandus
        in his Ornithologia, Book I, and Gesnetus in his 5th Book on
        Birds. </p>
      <p>Likewise, it is also known that snakes slough off their old
        skins,
        which
        are sometimes found in the bushes. I will here not speak much of
        the
        big
        grasshoppers and their sloughing. I myself have encountered it
        in
        Dauphine
        when I traveled there to have a look at the most beautiful and
        highest
        bridge in the world. It has only one arch and reaches from one
        mountain
        to another, from where the wind appears at certain hours from an
        unfathomable
        hole in the rock, blowing along the river as far as Orange. Thus
        we
        also
        read in Philostratus, Book 3, Chap. 1 of his life of Apollonius
        of
        Tyana
        that there exist on the highest cliffs of Mount Caucasus, which
        no man
        can climb, a special kind of monkey which gather the pepper for
        the
        inhabitants.
        The meat of these monkeys is an absolutely good remedy for old
        and sick
        lions, for if they devour one of these animals, they recover and
        become
        young again. </p>
      <p>If then birds and animals can become young again, we can
        reasonably
        infer that it can also be possible for man. When we are born,
        our
        constitution
        is quite warm and moist, while in old age it is cold and dry. It
        is
        therefore
        only necessary to replace the radical moisture and the all too
        great
        dryness
        of old people with the moist constitution of youth. </p>
      <p>Now I must really show that individuals have indeed lived who
        became
        young again. Medea, well skilled in medicine, rejuvenated the
        old
        Jason.
        That is why Ovid said in Book 7 of his <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
        that
        Medea
        had Jason chopped and boiled, which is to be understood as
        referring to
        baths prepared by her with minerals and other ingredients. And
        this is
        not contrary to truth, because Petrus Martyr Augerius, a ma from
        Milan,
        asserts in his Decadibus that there is a well on the island of
        Bonique
        which causes old people drinking it to become young and strong
        again,
        although
        their hair stays grey and the wrinkles in their faces do not
        disappear.
        There is supposed to be a similar well in Lucayam according to a
        report
        by Petrus Chieza (Chapter 14, Part 2, <i>Historie de Peru</i>).
        We can
        also look up what Herodotus writes in Book 4 about the power and
        virtue
        of such waters, which have therefore been called fountains of
        youth. </p>
      <p>In the first discourse of his <i>Horti Floridi</i>, Torquemada
        reports
        that in Italy, in the year 1531, an old man of 100 years who, as
        they
        say,
        already had one foot in the grave, was once rejuvenated in every
        respect
        and lived another 50 years thereafter. He says the name of
        another old
        man, which the town councilor of the place himself attested to.
        Valescus
        Tarentasius writes that he saw in Monvedro, also called Sagonza,
        in the
        Spanish kingdom of Valencia, an abbess who creaked with old age,
        had no
        tooth in her mouth, and was walking around deeply bent. Then, he
        writes,
        her teeth were growing again, her hair was becoming black, the
        wrinkles
        in her face disappeared, and she got a beautiful smooth forehead
        like a
        girl of 15. Yes, in a word, she had become young again. </p>
      <p>Two more recent and credible historians, Ferdinand Castana in
        his
        8th
        and Petrus Maffeus in his 11th Book, testify that a noble red
        Indian
        had
        rejuvenated himself three times within 340 years, the time he
        had been
        living. This report is sufficiently authentic, as Mendoza
        assures us in
        his <i>Viridario</i>, 4th Book, 17th Problem, that various
        Jesuits had
        known and spoken with this three times rejuvenated Indian, and
        also
        confirmed
        it in their letters. </p>
      <p>Now we will speak of the Universal Medicine and its
        composition,
        after
        first declaring that it does not consist in any alkali or acid,
        which
        are
        two principles only recently talked about. </p>
      <p>If we are to believe Takenius and after him his new
        Hippocratic-Chymical
        sect, it is possible to become a great medical doctor all at
        once and
        without
        much studying and pondering, acquiring very fast a great
        reputation.
        For
        nothing is required except a man have a good knowledge of acids,
        alkalis,
        and opiates. When the patient is hot as if he were lying in
        fire, he
        must
        be given an alkali to stop the fire. On the contrary, an acid
        must be
        given
        to someone down with frost and cold in order t arouse the
        natural
        warmth.
        Opium, however, is to be given to the patient to provide him
        with sleep
        and rest when, for instance, the pain is great. In fact, many
        attain to
        glory and a great name through the quick help and relief they
        are
        giving
        the patients. This I have seen that one of them cured a catarrh
        with a
        great Universal Sweat, by grinding in a marble mortar a certain
        kind of
        turnip, called tenderette in Paris, and applying the stuff on
        the soles
        of the patient’s feet. </p>
      <p>However, the Universal medicine cannot consist of an alkali, or
        opiate.
        They only do away with the patient’s symptoms but cannot remove
        the
        cause
        of the illness which is due to a humore peccante in the inmost
        of the
        members
        and must necessarily and above all be eliminated. </p>
      <p>When the humores peccantes or malignancies, or other poisonous
        substances
        are volatile and subtle, they are to be driven out through the
        pores of
        the body by perspiration. But when they are mostly moist,
        through
        sweating.
        When they are moist but not subtle, they are eliminated through
        the
        urine;
        when they are less moist and on the contrary more material, the
        elimination
        can be done through purging or vomiting. The patient must not be
        weakened
        through purging, however, but his nature is to be strengthened.
      </p>
      <p>Now I Have Come To Speak About The Required Qualities Of The
        Universal
        Medicine: </p>
      <p>A Universal Remedy must have a kinship and likeness to our
        natural
        heat
        and radical moisture, partly to maintain them but partly also to
        replace
        them. Thus our exhausted forces are increased in such a way that
        Nature
        will without urging and of herself drive out of the inmost of
        the body
        all the things that are bad and contrary to her, be they acid or
        alkali,
        or coagulated, which causes stitches in the side (pleuralgia),
        catarrhs,
        podagra, etc. It generally happens that a man gets much
        overheated by
        strenuous
        exercise, resulting in cold through breathing air that is too
        cold and
        drinking liquid that is too cold. Afterwards, in cooling, the
        nitrous
        parts
        intermix with the fermenting blood in the lungs, and when there
        occurs
        a slight concentration of the blood, some of it is expelled at
        the end
        of the arteries. </p>
      <p>Now and then the matter expelled attached itself to some part
        of
        body
        and causes pain in the nerves, due to the sharpness it had
        acquired.
        This
        continues till the natural warmth of the body dissipated or
        expels the
        sharp part. If this cold inhalation takes place at the time of
        the
        digestion,
        it can also cause an extravasatum through the lung, which mixes
        with
        the
        chyle and is conducted to a spot where it is not only so easy to
        dissipate
        it and is the cause of arthritic matter. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the Universal Medicine has to evacuate everything
        alien
        to Nature, everything in the inmost of the members, through
        perspiration,
        sweating, or urinating, but seldom through defecating, and still
        more
        rarely
        through vomiting. Ordinary medicines have no such effect. They
        attack
        with
        overheating and with poisonous sameness do violence to the sick
        matter
        of Nature, forcing her to get rid of her enemies, almost against
        her
        powers.
        Furthermore, the Universal Medicine must be composed in such a
        way that
        it can be administered at all times, to every constitution and
        every
        age,
        to both children and old people, without its more or less strong
        dose
        being
        harmful. It is supposed to cure the most desperate illness after
        taking
        it a few times. It is also supposed to be a general remedy for
        all
        external
        damages. There now follows the preparation of this Universal
        Medicine. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Composition of the Universal Medicine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take some purified Air-Salt, put it into an iron vessel and let
        it
        gradually
        melt. When it is melted, pour on it some finely ground
        lindenwood
        charcoal
        which will immediately burn and be consumed. That is why one has
        to let
        it burn gradually till the salt is almost fixed after the
        detonation,
        and
        it gets a somewhat bluish-green color. This happens when the
        charcoal
        no
        longer puffs up as it did before. There after, pour the melted
        salt
        into
        a marble mortar while it still quite warm. When it has cooled,
        it is as
        white as alabaster and brittle as glass. </p>
      <p>Now pound it small and sprinkle the powder on a glass slab or
        table
        but cover it to prevent any dust from falling on it. Hand it in
        the
        air,
        at a place where neither the sun nor the rain nor the white
        frost can
        touch
        it. Put a glass vessel underneath it, into which the oil that
        will drip
        fro it can fall, because the humidity in the air resolves this
        alkali
        within
        14 days. </p>
      <p>You will find that the oil is twice as heavy as the salt
        previously
        was, provided this process is undertaken at the right time, that
        is,
        when
        the weather is neither too cold nor too warm but moderately
        humid. Then
        the salt attracts the air invisibly, just as we draw the breath
        into
        us.
        If this oil is well rectified according to the art, it is an
        excellent
        and powerful menstruum for extracting the essence from various
        mixtures. </p>
      <p>Now take 4 or 5 parts of this rectified oil and one part of the
        best
        antimony. It can be recognized by a certain redness which it has
        from
        the
        gold, to whose ore it is close. Pound the antimony on a marble
        to a
        very
        fine powder, put it into a cucurbit and pour your rectified oil
        on it,
        in such a way that two-thirds of the glass stay empty. Quickly
        close
        the
        glass so that no air gets into it, let it digest in gentle heat
        or at
        an
        oil hanging-lamp, until the oil floating on the antimony gets a
        golden
        or ruby color. Then pour the oil gently off, filter it through
        paper,
        put
        it into a phial, and pour on it an equal weight of the rectified
        spirit
        of wine. At least two thirds of the glass must be empty. Stopper
        it
        tightly,
        let it digest in small heat for several days, till the spirit of
        wine
        has
        attracted all the tincture of the oil. </p>
      <p>Thus the oil will stay quite clear and white at the bottom, but
        above
        will float the spirit of wine with the golden tincture of the
        impregnated
        antimony. Separate from it the menstruum, by decanting, which
        can
        always
        serve for several processes and operations in order to extract
        the
        essence
        of antimony as often as desired. </p>
      <p>Put your tinctured spirit of wine into a glass alembic,
        abstract
        and
        distill it gradually, till only about one-fifth that contains
        the
        tincture
        of antimony is left at the bottom. Or distill all the spirits of
        wine,
        so that nothing stays at the bottom except the essence or
        tincture of
        antimony.
        Thus you will have the Universal Medicine either as a powder or
        a
        liquid,
        with which you can cure all illnesses or preserve yourself from
        them. </p>
      <p>When it is used as a liquid, 5 or 6 drops of it are taken with
        wine
        or bouillon, or in any other liquid suitable for the illness. </p>
      <p>When it is used as a powder, 3, 4, or 5 grains more or less are
        taken.
        For even if the dose is a little stronger or weaker, it is not
        harmful
        like the medicines which all have poisonous qualities. The sick
        become
        healthy after taking it 2 or 3 times. But is the illness does
        not
        yield,
        the dose must each time be increased, and this has to be done
        three
        times
        a week. </p>
      <p>This medicine cures all, even the oldest and most severe
        illnesses,
        such as the 4-day fever, dropsy, and the falling sickness
        (epilepsy).
        Yes,
        it not only cures all internal but also the external illnesses,
        such as
        wounds, ulcers, and cancer, when it is spread over them like a
        balm. It
        serves no less for deafness and eye troubles. </p>
      <p>Finally, this medicine drives all headaches away and helps
        digestion.
        It is a true Aurum Potabile (potable gold). It generally works
        quite
        invisibly
        through the perspiration; more frequently through vomiting.
        Consequently,
        its effect is quite natural and without force so that the
        patient does
        not become weak, exhausted, or debilitated, as usually happens
        with
        other
        medicines. It can therefore be used at any age, at any time, and
        irrespective
        of the constitution. Use it and make it known, but especially
        let the
        poor
        benefit
        from it, and praise God Almighty Who has created the medicine. </p>

      <p>By J.J. Chymiphilo, <br>
        Anno 1720 </p>
      <p>Those who know the Art of making gold keep it as secret as
        possible,
        though they reveal it sometimes in a strange way, as is shown by
        the
        following
        story. </p>
      <p>A special booklet has been published, dealing with the
        infallible
        knowledge
        of Friedericus Gualdus to make gold. The gist and an extract of
        that
        booklet
        are here presented. The author writes as follows: </p>
      <p>I was still a young boy, when I met Herr Friederich Gualdus for
        the
        first time. However, my young age did not allow me to recognize
        his
        enlightened
        intelligence as well as his profound erudition. Neither do I
        know if he
        had then already been a long or a short time in our town, but I
        only
        remember
        his face and whole being represented a man of about 40 years. He
        kept
        that
        figure all the time, without change, till the year 1680, at what
        time I
        was obliged to leave for Naples on account of my business. </p>
      <p>At first, he behaved like any traveler and was either
        completely
        alone
        or had a small boy in his service. He was living in two average
        rooms
        which
        were not fully furnished and hardly comfortable enough for a
        good
        student
        to live in. Nevertheless, he made friends, I do not know how,
        with some
        noble gentlemen of this State, who, although they owned various
        mines,
        could not continuing exploiting them due to the losses they had
        suffered.
        He began to help with such a considerable advance of money that
        they
        soon
        disposed of 60,000 ducats. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, he fell in love with a young girl of this
        noble
        house,
        although she was still a child. Her mother, who was very
        grateful to
        him
        because of the benefits they had received, through which her
        mine and
        at
        the same time her family were again on the road to prosperity,
        also
        felt
        that she could not prove her gratitude better than if she became
        related
        by blood to such a great benefactor. Although the child was not
        yet fit
        for matrimony, she nevertheless set a later date for the
        marriage, thus
        getting enough time to draw up the marriage contract in proper
        documents,
        and she promised a dowry of 16,000 ducats. To show his consent,
        Gualdus
        in turn agreed to return the same amount (if the marriage did
        not take
        place). He also meant to bestow on his fiancée still much
        greater
        riches than he had already granted her parents. </p>
      <p>Just as it is only too true that noble gentlemen often change
        their
        minds, so the said aristocrats, after attaining a higher status,
        to
        which
        the benefits of Gualdus had especially helped them, considered
        themselves
        far too good to make friends with an unknown man, and
        immediately tried
        to undo the deal. Such an unfair procedure hurt Gualdus very
        much. He
        withdrew
        from their friendship and demanded that the money he had laid
        out
        should
        be returned to him. As many difficulties were put in his way, he
        tried
        to make legal steps to recover his property. However, to cut off
        every
        further annoyance and quarrel, he consented to relinquish half
        of his
        claim
        in a settlement giving him instead a beautiful and honest
        testimony. </p>
      <p>So that those noblemen should learn that they had lost a great
        deal
        with his friendship, he took very uncommon steps to be raised
        into the
        Venetian nobility. With this in mind, he proposed to the most
        high
        Republic
        to undertake a great, useful, and profitable work at his
        expense, if he
        were in return raised into nobility, which many acquired at that
        time
        by
        paying the sum of 100,000 ducats. But there existed quite
        irremovable
        obstacle
        to this proposal, insofar as it was not in accord with the
        sovereignty
        of the Republic to give a reward to anyone before he had earned
        it.
        Therefore
        Gualdus decided to pay those 100,000 ducats, but in the name of
        a
        depositor
        and on condition that they be restituted to him after he had
        carried
        out
        his abovementioned proposal. Otherwise the money would be left
        to the
        Republic. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, he was raised into the Venetian
        nobility
        under
        the pretext of some merits, and declared a Patrician, and not
        like the
        others who had paid a great amount of money. </p>
      <p>But the Council, which kept very strictly to its wise rules,
        did
        not
        wish to introduce an innovation with that admission and again
        cancelled
        the treaty it had made with Gualdus, although his name had never
        appeared
        in it, and in such cases only the words "an unknown person
        proposes"
        are
        used, and the man is only named when the proposals are accepted
        and the
        conditions fulfilled. It was nevertheless learned subsequently
        that
        Gualdus
        had proposed such a work and had also accomplished it. </p>
      <p>After he had dedicated his mind to wisdom and withdrawn his
        thought
        from vanity and love, he sought his peace wholly and solely in
        the true
        wisdom, and abandoned himself totally to it. </p>
      <p>Only after this, his deep knowledge and high intelligence were
        recognized
        in the societies of learned men where he was present several
        times. For
        when they were discussing philosophical matters, he always knew
        how to
        dissolve the syllogism effortlessly and to put the disputing
        parties to
        shame. When they spoke of political and world affairs, there was
        no one
        with a better knowledge of the most secret government intrigues,
        or
        better
        acquainted with the cabinets and secret council chambers of high
        potentates.
        Was theology at stake or common law, he proved that he
        thoroughly knew
        the most hidden canons and most famous verdicts. Aside from all
        this,
        he
        was no less an accomplished astronomer and also uncommonly
        experienced
        mathematician. In short, no science could be discussed that he
        did not
        thoroughly understand. Yes, the stories of the oldest times were
        as
        fresh
        in his memory as if they had only happened today. Thus he also
        spoke
        various
        languages perfectly, that is, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, French,
        Italian,
        and
        others aside from German which was (he said) his mother tongue.
      </p>
      <p>Such extraordinary qualities could not stay hidden but come to
        the
        attention
        of many learned men and persons of rank in Italy. Among them,
        some had
        already heard a great deal about him when they arrived in
        Venice. Aside
        from trying to see rare things, their special purpose was to see
        Mr
        Gualdus
        and to do their utmost to obtain his friendship, which they
        subsequently
        kept up with letters. Yes, some only went to Venice so as to
        continually
        associate with him and have the honor of being called his
        scholars.
        This
        all the more after the rumor was circulated that he possessed
        the
        Hermetic
        Treasure, owing to the fact that his portrait had been seen by
        many
        painting
        experts who asserted that it had been done by Titian’s famous
        hand.
        Already
        a long time ago he had markedly decorated his residence with
        fine
        paintings,
        putting the most recent in the best rooms. Behind the door,
        however, he
        had hung the said portrait. One day some people, among whom
        there was
        an
        experienced painter, came into his house to look at his
        pictures. When
        the painter saw this painting behind the door, which had just
        been
        closed
        accidentally, he was amazed and called out loud, "This is the
        hand of
        Titian!".
        Gualdus laughed and said that if it were true, he would be over
        200
        years
        old, while he was only 86. This happened in the year 1677. The
        painter,
        however, would not stop but continued asserting that it was the
        hand of
        Titian, although Gualdus pretended to be 86 years old and
        although he
        only
        looked like a man of 40 and was also able to do all those things
        which
        a man can do in the prime of life. </p>
      <p>This rumor was the cause why people became firmly convinced
        that
        Gualdus
        possessed the great secret. Indeed, at this time Mr Margues
        Santinelli
        applied for the first time for his intimate friendship, seeking
        it in
        all
        possible ways, and finally he obtained it. Petrus Andreas
        Andreiny, a
        Florentine
        nobleman, did no less. In Naples he was famous both for his
        wealth and
        for chiefly collecting old medals, coins and other curiosities.
        Therefore,
        when shortly thereafter Mr Marquese had a small book printed at
        his
        cost
        under the title of <i>Androgenes Hermeticus</i>, etc., it was
        said
        that
        it contained Gualdus’ teachings, since few books had been
        written so
        well
        and emphatically about this science as just the said small work.
        However,
        Mr Marguese must in this not be denied his share of fame, as his
        incomparable
        sonnets printed in the same booklet are no mean ornament and can
        easily
        make us believe that Androgenes itself was his learned
        offspring. </p>
      <p>Aside from those, there were various other very learned
        clergymen
        who
        resorted to this Oracle with their questions. Because I knew one
        of
        them,
        who was both of noble extraction and belonged to a famous Order,
        and
        his
        letters and ensuing answers passed through my hands I do not
        consider
        it
        wrong to add these here, especially as I am sure that this will
        please
        all learned and intellectually curious persons. </p>

      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>It is the custom of high minds that they are not displeased by
        the
        desire
        of those who are anxious to learn something and therefore wish
        to
        become
        their servants and students. This is also the reason why I am
        not
        ashamed
        to appear before you with these bad lines, although I am not
        quite so
        constituted
        that I would be worthy to acquire something of your immense
        erudition.
        The fame of your special virtues has come to my attention
        through
        someone
        who traveled through Venice last year. I questioned him most
        carefully
        about every word one hears about you and concluded that you must
        possess
        the true science, although the said man did not understand the
        least of
        it. Therefore I cannot but inform you of that which Divine Grace
        has
        been
        pleased to grant me after 7 years of effort and work. </p>
      <p>I have been wandering through the world for 7 years, trying to
        find
        the Damascene Field, to obtain from it the Virgin Earth, which
        is the
        sole
        material of our magistery or masterpiece, just as Diogenes
        showed with
        his light where it is to be found. Regarding this, Michael
        Sendivogius
        has opened my understanding, Morienus has confirmed me in my
        opinion,
        and
        Moses Hermes has given me the explanation of everything. </p>
      <p>Thank God that He hears who call in Him incessantly and learn
        how
        happy
        the man is who is assisted by His Grace. Therefore I do not omit
        to
        give
        you thereby a comprehensive account, so that, if perhaps a trace
        of the
        true science were to appear in me, you might help promote that
        heavenly
        favor in one who by Nature does not appreciate anything more
        than the
        Secret
        of the Wise. </p>
      <p>Thus, our living gold is well known to me. I know the water by
        which
        the gold is dissolved as well as the sympathy that develops
        between
        both,
        because both descend from one Father. And I have also well
        noticed that
        the Sun is the father, the Moon the mother, and the Wind (Air)
        the
        carrier.
        But, as God does not give everything to one alone, although I
        have read
        almost all philosophers some difficulties to be cleared still
        appear
        among
        themselves about it, that I do not understand this part
        correctly.
        Therefore
        I come, not as the Queen of Sheba to Solomon but as an ignoramus
        to the
        Oracle, and I demand a clear answer, understandable to my stupid
        mind,
        not a veiled or obscure one, with the assurance that if Good
        should
        bestow
        His Grace upon me, I would immediately express my due thanks at
        your
        feet
        and subject my will to you in everything. </p>
      <p>As I have now learned, the whole difficulty of our Art consists
        in
        the
        preparation of our water. I have seen the Sun and the Moon in
        the first
        philosophical sublimation of our water and have drawn it off 7
        times
        from
        the moon. I would like to know whether our Mercury, after being
        purified
        7 times, is then perfect and capable of penetrating through the
        pores
        and
        airholes of the Egg, and of dissolving the Sun.&nbsp; Or is
        another
        manipulation
        still required to turn it into powder, such as the relocation?
        My
        doubts
        are caused by the fact that it is not snow-white and there is
        still
        some
        of its smell about it. As it is not fixed when it ceases to
        smoke, how
        then can it make things fixed? Therefore I pray you for God’s
        sake to
        tell
        me if the thus 7 times purified Mercury is perfect. If it is
        not, what
        else is required? The other difficulty that I encounter lies in
        the
        feces
        of our sea, from which in my opinion I have extracted the
        saltpeter
        which,
        however, is so sharp that the nose cannot withstand its smell, I
        do not
        know therefore, for what I should use it, seeing that the
        Mercury is
        purified. </p>
      <p>Our cinnabar does not require any ferment, as Nature has
        already
        made
        it perfect, though it becomes much purer when purified through
        the Art.
        Of what use then is salt? I believe that it must serve to
        ferment the
        water.
        Would you therefore please inform me if all the water is to be
        fermented,
        or only that part where the snake penetrates. Also, what weights
        and
        measures
        are to be used to do it? For meanwhile I am thinking that one
        part of
        salt
        and ten parts of Mercury must be taken, although I am in this
        case not
        aware of the proportion of the weight. Aside from this, I would
        also
        like
        to know how much of the Mercury must be prepared, so that the
        imprisoned
        child does not lack milk. </p>
      <p>I have come across another difficulty on account of the form
        and
        shape
        of the vessel. But I am speaking of the last fixation, when I
        believe
        that
        the form must be like a chicken’s egg, fully filled and sunk in
        so much
        that the snake’s head does not rise above it. But while the
        philosophers
        say that it must have a long neck, I would like to hear about
        this from
        your mouth and be informed whether part of the snake must show
        out of
        the
        menstruum and the neck stay inside. For this causes me some
        thinking,
        as
        I am afraid that the air of the neck would hinder the generation
        or
        birth. </p>
      <p>As I usually take into account all contingencies, I would also
        like
        to know if it is better to take the gold and silver direct from
        the
        mountain,
        to enable the sympathy to manifest itself all the more strongly,
        or to
        take the gold only from the mountain, and the Moon from the
        hill. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is stated for certain in the books that the
        Phoenix,
        when it just comes out of its nest, must be captured thus pure
        and that
        not the least little thing must be added to it or taken from it.
        But if
        there should be a mistake in this, do deem me worthy of being
        reminded
        of it, and if you feel that God is pouring His grace over me,
        kindly
        help
        me and also reply to my above-indicated doubting questions
        without
        naming
        the authors. But neither despise my stupidity which causes me to
        write
        this with so little purity, but which is nevertheless a gift of
        God who
        is well aware that neither profit nor another worldly intention
        but a
        mere
        desire to know something and subsequently to apply all the
        knowledge to
        the honor of the Giver thereof, has impelled me to this study.
        Do
        therefore
        with me as God will inspire you, as I am assured that He who has
        inspired
        me to write to you has also given you the kindness to satisfy
        me.
        Finally,
        I remain with my whole heart, etc., Sir, Your most humble and
        obliged
        servant,
        D.C. von R. </p>
      <p>Please inform me also how the vessel can be cared for so as to
        last
        for 9 months. </p>

        <p><b>Reply of Mr Friederich Gualdus to the Preceding Letter</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>Your letter has been handed to me, and although you are not
        known
        to
        me, I have sufficiently recognized your great intelligence from
        your
        lines.
        Meanwhile I much regret that I am not qualified, much less able,
        to
        answer
        your serious questions. In this I am the more excused as I am
        well
        acquainted
        with the Italian language. But to satisfy you nevertheless
        somewhat
        according
        to my little understanding I first say that you are speaking all
        too
        obscurely
        in your letter, like the true philosophers, and you therefore
        mix
        everything
        up so covertly that one does not know how to reply. There is a
        good
        deal
        to be said for the fact that on the Damascene Field that Virgin
        Earth
        is
        found which is the material of our magistery and work of art.
        And I
        will
        add that the said Virgin Earth has never seen either the sun or
        the
        moon,
        although it contains the Sun and the Moon. However, you do not
        say how
        this Damascene Field, let alone this Virgin Earth, as the
        material of
        our
        work of art, is constituted. And how and in what manner it can
        be
        obtained. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, you write: Thus, our living gold is well known to
        me,
        by
        what it is dissolved, as well as the sympathy that develops
        between
        both,
        because both descend from one father. All this may very well be
        so, but
        you do not report of what kind this living gold is and this
        water that
        dissolves it, s I cannot give you a considered opinion on it. In
        the
        same
        way you are also confused about I do not know what difficulties,
        which
        is due to the fact that you do not work with the right material.
        In
        addition,
        you mention that the whole secret consists in the preparation of
        our
        water,
        and that the Sun and the Moon are contained in it, which is all
        pure
        truth. </p>
      <p>Regarding the difficulty which you encounter with the sevenfold
        sublimation
        of our water, that is, whether or not it is then perfect, I
        reply as
        follows:
        The philosophers want us to distill the water 7 times, but they
        say
        septies,
        aut pluries (seven times of more). And Sendivogius indicates
        when it is
        perfect, namely, when it leaves white feces at the bottom, so
        that is
        the
        unmistakable sign of its perfection. </p>
      <p>You find the second difficulty in the feces of our sea, from
        which
        you
        have extracted the salt. From this I feel that you are so much
        mistaken
        in the material as in your manner of working, thus creating many
        difficulties.
        Therefore, if you had worked with the right materia is at hand,
        the
        right
        vessel follows afterwards of its own. </p>
      <p>But as far as your other questions are concerned, namely,
        whether
        it
        is better to take the gold and silver from the mountain or
        solely the
        sun
        from the mountain and the Moon from the hill, I do not know what
        peculiar
        talk this is. I believe that you are confused in everything, and
        I
        cannot
        understand whether your words are puzzles, figurative speech, or
        fiction.
        Therefore I do not know how to reply to them. Pardon me if I
        speak
        frankly
        and without hypocrisy. In the meantime, if I can help you with
        something
        else, I am ready to do so upon a hint from you. I remain, etc.,
        Sir,
        your
        most devoted friend, Friederich Gualdus. </p>
      <p>Venice, 1 September 1678. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <center>
        <p><b>Second Letter of D.C. von R to Mr Gualdus</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>I thank you very much that you found me worthy and replied to
        my
        ignorance,
        which is really an effect of your generosity and not of my
        merits. And
        I consider your letter no less than an answer given by the
        Oracle,
        although
        you have not replied anything essential to my questions
        concerning the
        Work, and I can see from your polite lines that you have not
        clearly
        indicated
        how the substance of the materia may be well known to me. But
        after
        obtaining
        the knowledge of that materia from the Lord of Truth, I only
        wished to
        get some information on how it has to be treated and approached,
        which
        someone who does not ask for anything else can easily obtain. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Therefore, in order to obtain it, I said that I had found
        the
        Virgin Earth in the Damascene Field. Although you are saying
        exactly
        the
        same you then add that I had not named it. And although I am not
        allowed
        to name it (especially in a letter) because it has never been
        named by
        any philosopher, it is still sufficient that I said that I had
        found it
        with the help of the lamp of Diogenes. But if you nevertheless
        demand
        that
        I name it, I say that its real name is: Our water, our gold. It
        is that
        water which the philosopher rectifies seven times and the
        menstruum of
        our gold, that is, of that gold which is the Virgin Earth of the
        Damascene.
        As it has been formed by Nature, it is also put into the
        rectified
        water
        without any deduction or addition, to dissolve, sublimate, and
        calcine.
        This is the whole magistery or work of art, to fathom which
        God’s Mercy
        bestowed His Grace on me after great expense and damage, for my
        incessant
        prayer and efforts. </p>
      <p>Our material has various names, just as the place from which it
        it
        is
        names in my previous letter, after reporting that the water and
        the
        gold
        are always of the same kind. As I had spoken in a veiled manner,
        I
        wanted
        especially to know if I had to take both the gold and the water
        from a
        mountain, or the water only from a mountain. That difficulty or
        doubt
        arose
        from the fact that Morienus writes: That which contains all
        things in
        itself
        does not need any other aid, which is contrary to the opinion of
        other
        philosophers who take the water from the small mountain. </p>
      <p>Sir, I have sufficiently disclosed my thoughts, Just then as
        our
        magistery
        can be compared to human generation, and yet, children are not
        always
        born,
        although I took refuge with you, as the Oracle, so that I might
        be
        instructed
        by you in the manipulations and would consequently not be
        mistaken if I
        wished to take up the Work. Seeing that I cannot find anything
        in the
        books
        that would satisfy me. </p>
      <p>In particular, however, I would like to know what I am to do
        with
        the
        feces. While all pretend that the water must not be rectified
        more than
        seven times and the feces were left at the bottom. What then am
        Ito do
        with them? If I pour fresh water on them and distill them till
        they
        become
        white, I go against the rules of the most experienced
        philosophers and
        nevertheless doubt that they become white thereby. Yes, I also
        worry
        that
        the water might lose its power. But supposing that they become
        white,
        what
        am I to do with them, because they are highly esteemed by
        Hermes? Am I
        perhaps to put them back into the water, now quite white, while
        it
        ripens
        the warm gold? According to the saying of Brother Basil. As I am
        at it,
        must its earth be fertilized or not? </p>
      <p>I pray you to come to the aid of my ignorance and to show me
        clearly,
        and not in riddles, where I may go wrong, and also give me your
        instruction
        in the greatest difficulty but especially concerning the vessel
        of the
        last fixation, as I do not know into what the gold must be put,
        if it
        has
        to have a long neck or be shaped like an egg; likewise, is it to
        be
        completely
        full or empty in the neck; also, if all the material has to be
        immersed
        or one-third allowed to [protrude; and then if if the vessel can
        last
        for
        9 months. </p>
      <p>I pray you, remember what Solomon said in his Book of Wisdom,
        which
        he imparted without begrudging, and be assured that this time
        you will
        gratify a man who is not altogether unworthy of such a favor. I
        am
        therefore
        expecting complete instructions from your kindness, how I have
        to
        operate,
        as also the removal of my other doubts. Under God’s favorable
        protection
        commendation. I remain with all respect, Sir, Your obedient
        servant and
        student. D.C. von R. <br>

        <p><b>Reply of Mr Friederich Gualdus to the Above Letter</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>I am in receipt of your letter and have understood from it, no
        less
        than from your first communication, that you do not possess the
        right
        material,
        but have a vain and erroneous opinion of it, so that everything
        you
        undertake
        with it will be a useful and fruitless effort, Pardon me if I
        speak
        freely,
        I cannot be hypocritical but am telling the truth. If you were
        well
        acquainted
        with the right knowledge of the real philosophy, in which both
        the
        material
        and the operation are kept strictly secret, it would not be so
        difficult
        for you. True, it is not without reason that the philosophers
        are
        keeping
        every thing very secret, both the material and also the
        operation. But
        one depends entirely on the other, so that, if the material is
        known,
        it
        is also easy to know the operation can also easily be familiar
        with the
        material. There exists in the world only one material for which
        all
        operations
        taught by the right philosophers are suitable. Therefore they
        have not
        only kept the materia secret but necessarily also the operation.
        But,
        as
        mentioned, one depends on the other, which is the reason why it
        cannot
        be clearly said in words, far less described in letters. </p>
      <p>This divine and sacred science is acquired in only two ways,
        although
        through divine revelation or through the instruction of a
        faithful
        friend.
        For to attain it by studying books is almost an impossibility.
        Therefore
        also, whoever wants to achieve it with many operations and
        various
        tests,
        will never reach his goal. For this science is just like other
        sciences
        and can quite certainly be learned without tests and
        manipulations, by
        understanding it with the mind. This is so true that it cannot
        be
        otherwise
        but must necessarily be so. Thus one also knows before
        undertaking the
        operation what kind of a thing it must be, and it is also
        possible to
        recognize
        by certain signs if one operates well or badly. Yes, one does
        not
        commit
        any error or mistake, but everything will completely agree with
        the
        rules
        of the best authors, so that, whoever receives in this the
        divine
        revelation
        and masters this science, cannot go wrong. </p>
      <p>As I do not see from your letter that you know the true
        materia, I
        cannot
        explain more about it or speak about the operation. I only say
        that the
        material is so wonderful and that whoever possesses it
        simultaneously
        has
        in his possession the vessel, the furnace, the fire, the
        menstruum, the
        gold, the silver, the Philosophical Mercury, and everything that
        belongs
        to the Philosophical Work. From this it follows that your
        questions
        rest
        on vain sophistic questions, and I will answer them in all
        liberty. For
        today, nothing more except that I remain at all times, Sir, Your
        most
        devoted
        servant, Friederich Gualdus. <br>
        Venice, 2 November 1678 </p>

        <p><b>Another Letter of D.C. von R. to Mr Gualdus</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>Oh! That I might travel to Venice and discuss with you! I would
        show
        you that my knowledge is not vain or imagined but true and based
        on the
        right philosophy. I would explain what great things the mineral
        kingdom
        contains, and also, palpably demonstrate how the radical
        moisture of
        the
        metals is constituted. I would discuss about the great and
        little
        world,
        and relate all the special features found at the creation of
        Adam, nor
        omit the least bit of the quality of the Damascene Field. I
        would
        indicate
        what is the Philosophical mercury, what are gold and silver.
        Yes, I
        would
        not leave untouched any of the most famous philosophical riddles
        but
        examine
        each most meticulously and show how clearly the scholars have
        spoken of
        it. But as I do not have the privilege of doing so, I must
        necessarily
        be quiet, especially also as I do not dare to deal with great
        things in
        letters. I am only telling myself that where the ray of
        knowledge has
        once
        begun to shine, it can impossibly be obscured by the clouds of
        contradiction.
        Of this we have an all too cleat example in Trevisan, who,
        having once
        recognized truth could never be turned away from it by others
        who tried
        to confuse him out of envy. </p>
      <p>I know for sure that you would indeed understand that I am not
        wrong
        if you possessed such a great treasure. Do not believe that this
        is
        mere
        speculation, but it is the true realization ex visceribus cause
        (from
        my
        guts). Even if I have so far not attained perfection, it is not
        due to
        an error but solely to the fact that I have not yet undertaken
        the
        Work,
        although
        two years have already passed since I was illumined by God.
        Consequently,
        I do not know by what secret power I have been held, causing me
        to be
        satisfied
        only with science, not bothering much about the rest, and only
        preparing
        our water with the greatest pleasure and content. Therefore I
        have
        nothing
        to complain about and rather hope that God, qui dat esse et
        perficere,
        after letting me come to the cognition of truth through His
        Mercy, will
        also grant me His help in achieving the perfection of it. The
        reason
        why
        I enjoyed the acquaintance of such a great man as I esteemed you
        to be,
        was that I had kept back and deliberated upon the random
        questions I
        had
        presented to you but subsequently was bold enough to trouble you
        with
        them
        in my letters, knowing well that it pleased the most famous
        philosophers
        to find capable individuals as their students to impart to them
        that
        knowledge
        which is of no use to anyone in the other world. </p>
      <p>For in just that way Morienus and others had been accepted and
        instructed
        by their teachers, However, it would have been stupid of me to
        try and
        obtain the knowledge of the true material, which had never been
        my
        intention.
        Instead, I tried to get an explanation about the vessel, the
        last
        fixation,
        and the feces of our sun. Do indeed not tell me that whoever
        knows one,
        must also know the other, as such a great difference between
        generation
        and science has occurred that many who have worked very much
        with the
        true
        materia, spoil and destroy it because they are treating it
        wrongly. </p>
      <p>Although I have learned from the generation of metals how to
        imitate
        Nature in the sublimation of our water, I still require a yet
        better
        light
        if I am to reach perfection. I well know that our living gold is
        not
        always
        dissolved in its water, the reason being that the water is
        perhaps not
        always good. Therefore I only beg you to inform me how the
        vessel must
        be formed (I am speaking here of the last fixation), whether,
        that is,
        it should have a long neck or be in the shape of a chicken egg.
      </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, I thin it should have a long neck, although I do
        not
        like
        this because, if it were formed like a chicken egg, not the
        least bit
        of
        air would touch our gold which would be closed like a hen’s egg.
        Also,
        like the latter, it contains the Mercury, Sulphur, and
        everything
        required
        for our magistery or Work of Art, and performs of its own all
        the
        operations
        described by the philosophers in so many ways. In its operation,
        we
        need
        do nothing except keep the heated water in its natural heat and
        pour
        some
        more on it when the child, or the Dragon within, begins to feed
        on it.
        In so doing, the same proportion must always be used. </p>
      <p>Therefore, you can probably very well give a truthful answer to
        these
        questions without revealing our water, in which resides the
        whole
        difficulty;
        likewise, how the purified feces are again united with the
        water, which
        is quite different from the knowledge of the materia, so much so
        that
        one
        can very well be known without the other. And because I rely on
        your
        courtesy
        to receive at least one single recipe, I have not given credence
        to one
        or another babbler. I hope, therefore, not to oppose truth. And
        even if
        the Supreme in His just judgment should not deign to favor me
        with the
        accomplishment of the Work and in so doing use my services, I
        shall
        nevertheless
        die quite cheerfully after cognizing and seeing the truth, like
        the
        philosophers
        who are only badly screamed at by unwise fools for heaving
        spoken the
        truth. </p>
      <p>Forgive my boldness of inconveniencing you with my ignorance,
        But
        I
        know for sure that you have understood what I have written to
        you, so
        that
        you do consider me quite such a great fool. No more for today,
        except
        that
        I remain, aside from commending you to God’s protection, etc.
        Sir, Your
        most devoted servant, C.D. von R., etc. <br>
        Naples, 3 December 1787 </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>From the aforesaid I now believe that everybody will understand
        that
        there was something uncommon and extraordinary about Gualdus.
        Here was
        a man who had lived like a poor student upon his arrival in
        Venice; who
        had never carried on any trade, thereby acquiring great riches;
        who had
        possessed neither goods nor revenues, and yet had loaned 60,000
        ducats
        to some families, in addition to being able to advance 100,000
        ducats
        for
        being raised into the Venetian aristocracy. He had sought the
        latter in
        quite a special way, as otherwise he would have had to register
        his
        arrival
        and age. Of the latter, however, his portrait, said most
        assuredly to
        have
        been made by Titian, is an undeniable testimony.&nbsp; After
        additionally
        spending many thousand ducats for the accomplishment of the work
        he had
        proposed, he finally also decorated his residence magnificently,
        while
        at the same timer performing other generous deeds. We are
        therefore not
        unjustified in believing that he must have possessed an
        inexhaustible
        treasure.
        As he knew simultaneously to keep himself in continual perfect
        health
        and
        at an invariably manly age, we must necessarily conclude that
        this
        treasure
        was that great medicine which extends its power over all three
        realms,
        the animal, vegetable, and mineral. </p>
      <p>But the above-mentioned cleric did not possess this treasure,
        as
        his
        life ended a few months after his above-quoted letter, in which
        he
        shows
        such great intelligence and boasts as if he had obtained the
        right and
        true materia. However, if such had indeed been the case, he
        himself
        would
        still be here to speak in protection of life, and would have
        brought to
        perfection that great magistery or Work of Art for which he had
        so
        zealously
        striven. </p>
      <p>In contradistinction, our Gualdus (or better, our hero) must
        without
        doubt be such a one. He gave the clearest signs of it when he
        finally
        departed
        from this town on 22 May 1682, perhaps for no other reason than
        that he
        had heard that his virtue had been revealed and made known
        everywhere.
        Before leaving, he had given full powers to his servant and
        instructed
        him in what he had to do wit his assets. That same day,
        unexpectedly,
        he
        had some underwear and clothes packed into a small box, as if he
        intended
        to go for a trip to his country estate near Treviso, saying that
        he
        would
        be back in a few days. The servant to whom he had commended the
        whole
        house
        with the most precious furniture, had to stay behind, however,
        and he
        thus
        went away all alone, without company, or rather, he disappeared
        when he
        was 90 years old, as he had said of himself, or perhaps several
        hundred
        years. </p>
      <p>The servants waited many days for the return of their master,
        but
        they
        did not see more of him, let alone receive letters, Finally they
        assumed
        that his journey had not been made to his country estate, as
        they also
        learned that he had not even arrived there. Therefore they
        disposed of
        part of his personal property according to the order he had left
        them,
        but they kept the rest for themselves. In so doing, they
        provided so
        well
        for their poverty that they were relieved of service ever after.
      </p>
      <p>This then, is the whole report that can be communicated to the
        world
        about such an unusual event. Nevertheless, I wish to add here a
        few
        other
        letters which this great man wrote and of which I transmitted
        the
        original.
        By them we can recognize even better how certainly ad
        undoubtedly he
        was
        in command of the Hermetic Art. To others, however, who might
        have the
        good fortune of surviving him, I will leave the honor of
        describing his
        course of life more precisely, etc. </p>

        <p><b>Letter of F. Gualdus to Mr N. N.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>You understand extremely well how water is to be reduced to or
        made
        into earth, of which one is dissolved and the other hardened
        into a
        shiny
        marble, while out of the latter the foliated Earth is
        sublimated. But
        the
        said reduction is done forward and above its own earth and with
        its own
        water, which has been drawn from it, however not with the lunar
        calx
        and
        the Mercury, which never combine together in such a way that
        they
        cannot
        again be separated from each other. </p>
      <p>By body-calx we mean our bodies, which are alive, while the
        bodies
        of
        the mob are dead. They no longer eat and drink; the tyrant of
        the world
        has killed them: Out of man grows man, and out of gold, gold;
        yet not
        out
        of dead but out of living gold. </p>
      <p>Our destroyed earth, forsaken by all spirits, is silver, and is
        our
        living gold is again united with its spirits, the shining earth
        will
        grow
        from it. </p>
      <p>You have made the luteballs (limeballs, glueballs) very well,
        and
        I
        hope that they will turn white. Everything is also quite
        airtight with
        the other earthenware vessels which become pale-yellow, because
        the
        pale
        will always cause the yellow to diminish, and they will always
        tend
        more
        toward whiteness. It is easy to give the Stone but exceedingly
        difficult
        to make it. It has to be obtained with pains and toil. Then it
        will be
        considered as that which it is. </p>
      <p>I remain with all my heart, Sir, Your very devoted most willing
        friend,
        Friederich Gualdus <br>
        Venice,11 September 1677 </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <center>
        <p><b>Another Letter of F. Gualdus to Mr N. N.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Sir, </p>
      <p>From your letter I see that things also go well with the boiled
        Mercury,
        which is so and not otherwise, nor can it be. I will tell you
        the
        reason
        why. </p>
      <p>Mercury cannot be hardened or turned into earth except by a
        certain
        degree of the fire especially required for it, which is called
        the fire
        of Mercury. But what kind of a thing is this fire? It is not,
        and
        cannot
        be, a mild fire, for even if Mercury were to stand for a
        thousand years
        in a mild fire, for even if Mercury were to stand for a thousand
        years
        in a mild fire, it would not harden. Neither is it, nor can it
        be, a
        strong
        fire, for if one were to put Mercury turned into earth into a
        strong
        fire,
        it would become wet and liquid, as it had been before. Since,
        them, it
        cannot be hardened by either a strong or a mild fire, its fire
        must
        necessarily
        be of a degree set between mild and strong. Because the whole
        Art
        consists
        in the right regulation of the fire, with this fire, which must
        have a
        carefully regulated strength, Mercury is hardened and turned
        into
        earth,
        accomplishing everything we desire. The reason why it must be
        turned
        into
        earth is that when it is wet or liquid, it is then so firm and
        dense
        that
        the flame cannot work in its form but the latter instead
        protects and
        covers
        it. </p>
      <p>But when it has become earth, it is open and the fire controls
        it,
        penetrating
        through all its pores, altering its form, rendering it
        heterogeneous
        and
        separable, while it had previously been quite dense, covered,
        closed,
        homogeneous
        with the essential substance of Mercury, and of the same nature,
        also
        impossible
        to be separated from it. </p>
      <p>The reason, however, why it was at first boiling and now no
        longer
        boils
        is that during such boiling part of its wateriness, which is the
        cause
        of its boiling, has been removed and consumed. If all the watery
        moisture
        were removed and consumed, it would no longer boil and get a
        beautiful
        azure-blue color. </p>
      <p>And with this all the doubts that you have presented in your
        registered
        letter are dissolved and explained. The rules are right,
        provided the
        degree
        of the fire is thereby observed; but if a mistake in the degree
        of fire
        occurs, everything is spoiled and done wrongly. </p>
      <p>Put up with my weakness. I cannot do much, but the little I
        know I
        am
        ready to impart to others, especially to you and your friends.
        For the
        rest, I always desire to learn more, so that I might serve you
        great
        merit
        as you deserve. Your affectionate and devoted friend, Friederich

      <p>Your desire to know the proportion of the water and the earth
        in
        their
        reduction can easily be satisfied, provided you first let
        totally go of
        all the utterances of the philosophers, because in this case
        they do
        not
        speak unanimously. For one wants to take 10 parts of water. The
        second
        speaks of nine, another again of seven parts. And Pontanus
        demands
        three
        parts. And thus there are still many others who have yet other
        opinions.
        Now we let go of all of them and consider what we have to do and
        what
        is
        necessary, in addition to the possibilities of nature. </p>
      <p>I say, therefore, that to extract the fixed and dry core of the
        Mercury
        after taking such great pains and completing the Herculean
        labor, it is
        necessary to keep the Work dry at all times. Therefore little
        water,
        yes,
        very little water is required, especially at the beginning, so
        that the
        earth, which is the dry part, can always keep control over the
        water.
        With
        little no mistake can be made. All the philosophers rather
        assert and
        say:
        If you wish to turn earth into water, take three parts of water
        and one
        part of earth; but if you wish to turn water into earth, take
        three
        parts
        of earth and one part of water, etc. This is the right rule. </p>
      <p>When now we turn water into earth, that is, reduce the water
        over
        the
        earth, and wish to make a dry mass, quite frozen and hard like a
        shining
        marble, we must give it very little water in one go and keep the
        mass
        dry,
        so that the dryness always has the upper hand. And in this way
        it can
        probably
        be done, although it will be a little difficult in the beginning
        and
        require
        some effort. But when the earth begins to give its water again,
        it will
        already be easier. Care must be taken, though, to remove that
        superfluous
        wetness, or urinal moisture every 8 or 15 days, as that raw part
        does
        not
        unite with the earth, because the earth only attracts the most
        cooked
        and
        tough part that it finds in the water and instead repels the raw
        part,
        so that it appears to be quite frozen. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, to answer the question whether they have to be
        kneaded
        together or whether the water has to be poured at the bottom of
        the
        vessel
        and the earth put over it, I say that it is all the same. The
        difference
        only consists in the fire, for if the water is poured below and
        the
        earth
        added above, a stronger fire is required, that is, such a strong
        one
        that
        the water can sublimate and enter the earth; but not so strong
        that the
        water inundated the earth completely like the sea. Because, if a
        firm
        union
        and true marriage like Chibric [Kibrik] and Beya [Beja] is to
        occur,
        they
        must not be separated but joined, so that they can stand
        together in a
        continual union that can never be separated. </p>
      <p>But if one wishes to knead them together and then puts them
        neat
        the
        fire, the latter must be fairly mild and small, because the
        moisture
        sublimates
        much more easily, while the earth stays open due to the rubbing
        (kneading).
        Although it is true that they unite much more firmly with less
        and
        longer
        heat. </p>
      <p>Be it now one or the other manner, the degree of the fire must
        be
        carefully
        watched, so that the woman does not separate from the man some
        raw and
        watery part that disappears in a little smoke (or steam). </p>
      <p>And this is what I can report in this matter. For, to tell the
        truth,
        the greatest part of the Herculean labor consists in finding the
        ash-colored
        earth, that is, in knowing how to separate the fixed part of our
        materia,
        which is quite volatile, and in this most of the alchemists
        blunder by
        wrongly considering the fixed body as something else. It is not
        so easy
        to go wrong in the rest, which is much surer to work, and there
        are not
        so many mistakes that can occur, just as you will experience and
        recognize
        that Sendivogius wrote the truth when he said: My center is
        highly
        fixed.
        Whoever has fixed that part will also fix its spirit, which has
        issued
        from it. With which I always remain, Your most affectionately
        devoted
        friend,
        Friederich Gualdus. <br>
        Venice, 22 May 1678. </p>

        <p><b>Conclusion of the Translator of the 1720 Edition</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;All the conclusions that can be drawn from the preceding
        report,
        however, are not so strong and certain that they could induce me
        to
        believe
        that our mortal life could be longer or shorter than the goal
        that has
        been set for it in the unchangeable degrees of Providence. True,
        I will
        admit that this is so very famous Stone can be found. Nor will I
        gainsay
        that those whom God had honored with his Grace really possess
        it, and
        that
        among those our Gualdus has to be especially reckoned.
        Nevertheless, it
        is far from being able to abolish Destiny or ward off those
        dangers
        against
        which neither medicines nor other help can do anything. For an
        unexpected
        fall that does not allow a man ot get up; the floods of the sea
        and the
        rivers which exhaust us quickly; buildings shaken and collapsing
        through
        earthquakes or other accidents, causing houses and residents to
        turn to
        ashes, all are such causes houses and residents to turn to
        ashes, all
        are
        such causes which Death has reserved for itself. I am sure that
        if
        death
        were a live body, he would laugh at our musings. Aside from
        this, I can
        also really believe that a good diet, as also the medicines that
        serve
        the preservation of the radical moisture and the natural heat,
        no less
        the medicine referred to by Herr Amptman, may well keep us
        healthy in
        our
        life but not, as stated, prolong it. Accordingly, those are only
        defying
        death who can maintain their life more than others without some
        regulation
        or medicine. </p>
      <p>Of this Gualdus the newspapers subsequently wrote a great deal,
        namely,
        that after leaving Venice, he was supposed to have stayed in
        Florence,
        Turin, and Paris, and finally at the Hague. Yes, after the
        papers
        reported
        last year that a man who had been considered an Adept at the
        Hague and
        for that reason moved away, had found his death in the Scheldt
        through
        the unfortunate overturning of his boat, was considered to be
        over 400
        years old although he looked like a 40-year old, many now
        believe that
        it must have been this Friederich Gualdus, who was at last
        called from
        this world by God through such a death.<br>
