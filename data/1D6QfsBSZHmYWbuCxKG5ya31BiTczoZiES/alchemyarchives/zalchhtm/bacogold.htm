<p><b><font size=+2>Experiment Solitary, Touching the <i>Making of Gold</i></font></b></center>

<p>The World hath been much abused by the Opinion of <i>Making of Gold</i>:
The
<i>Worke</i> it selfe I judge to be possible; But the <i>Meanes</i>
(hitherto propounded) to effect it, are, in the Practice, full of Errour
and Imposture; And in the Theory, full of unsound Imaginations. For to
say, that <i>Nature</i> hath an Intention to make all Metals <i>Gold</i>;
and that, if she were delivered from Impedients, shee would performe her
owne Worke; And that, if the Crudities, Impurities, and Leprosities of
<i>Metals</i>
were cured, they would become <i>Gold</i> ; And that a little
<i>Quantity</i>
of the <i>medicine</i>, in the Worke of <i>Projection</i>,will turne a
Sea of the <i>baser Metall</i> into <i>Gold</i>, by <i>Multiplying</i>:
All these are but dreams: And so are many other Grounds of <i>Alchymy</i>.
And to help the Matter, the
<i>Alchymists</i> call in likewise many Vanities,
out of <i>Astrology, Naturall Magicke</i>; Superstitious Interpretations
of <i>Scriptures</i>; Auricular <i>Traditions</i> ; Faigned Testimonies
of <i>Ancient Authors</i>; And the like. It is true, on the other side,
they have brought to light not a few profitable <i>Experiments</i>, and
thereby made the World some amends. But we, when we shall come to handle
the <i>Version</i> &amp;
<i>Transmutation</i> of <i>Bodies</i>; And the
<i>Experiments</i>
concerning <i>Metals</i>, and <i>Mineralls</i>; will lay open the true
Wayes and Passages of <i>Nature</i>, which may lead to this great Effect.
And we commend the wit of the <i>Chineses</i>, who despaire of Making of
<i>Gold</i>,
but are Mad upon the Making of <i>Silver</i>: For certain it is, that it
is more difficult to make <i>Gold</i>, (which is the most Ponderous and
Materiate amongst <i>Metalls</i>) of other <i>Metalls</i>, lesse Ponderous,
and lesse Materiate; than (<i>via versa</i>) to make <i>Silver</i> of <i>Lead</i>,
or <i>Quick-Silver</i>; both which are more Ponderous than
<i>Silver</i>;
So that they need rather a further Degree of <i>Fixation</i>, than any
<i>Condensation</i>.
In the meane time, by Occasion of Handling the <i>Axiomes</i> touching
<i>Maturation</i>,
we will direct a
<i>Triall</i> touching the
<i>Maturing</i> of <i>Metalls</i>,
and thereby turning some of them into
<i>Gold</i>: For wee conceive indeed,
that a perfect good
<i>Concoction</i>, or
<i>Disgestion</i> or <i>Maturation</i>
of some <i>Metalls</i>, will produce <i>Gold</i>. And here wee call to
Minde that we knew a <i>Dutch-man</i>, that had wrought himself into the
Beleefe of a great Person, by undertaking that he could make <i>Gold</i>:
Whose discousse was, that <i>Gold</i> might be made; But that the <i>Alchymists</i>
Over-fired the Worke: For (he said) the
<i>Making</i> of <i>Gold</i> did
require a very temperate
<i>Heat</i>, as being in <i>Nature</i> a Subterrany
Worke, where little <i>Heat</i> cometh; But yet more to the <i>Making</i>
of <i>Gold</i>, than of any other
<i>Metall</i>; And therefore, that he
would doe it with a great Lamp, that should carry a Temperate and Equall
Heat: And that it was the Work of many Moneths. The Device of the Lampe
was folly; But the Over-firing now used; And the Equall Heat to be required;
And the Making it a Worke of some good Time; are no ill Discourses.
<p>We resort therefore to our <i>Axiomes</i> of <i>Maturation</i>, in Effect
touched before. The First is, that there be <i>used a Temperate Heat</i>;
For they are ever <i>Temperate Heats</i> that <i>Disgest</i>, and <i>Mature</i>:
Wherein we meane <i>Temperate</i>, according to the <i>Nature</i> of the
<i>Subject</i>
; For that may be <i>Temperate</i> to <i>Fruits</i>, and
<i>Liquours</i>,
which will not Worke at all upon <i>Metalls</i>. The Second is, that the
<i>Spirit
of the Metall be quickened</i>, and the <i>Tangible Parts opened</i>: For
without those two Operations, the <i>Spirit</i> of the <i>Metall</i>, wrought
upon, will not be able to disgest the parts. The Third is that the <i>Spirits
doe spread themselves Even</i>, and <i>move not Subsultorily</i>; For that
will make the Parts Close, and Pliant. And this requireth a Heat, that
doth not rise and fall, but continue as <i>Equall</i> as may be. The Fourth
is, that <i>no Part of the Spirit be emitted, but detained</i>: For if
there be <i>emission</i> of <i>Spirit</i>, the Body of the <i>Metall</i>
will be Hard, and Churlish. And this will be performed, partly by the Temper
of the Fire; And partly by the closenesse of the Vessell. The Fifth is,
that there be <i>Choice made of the likeliest and best prepared Metall,
for the Version</i>: For that will facilitate the Worke. The Sixth is,
that you give <i>Time enough for the Worke</i>: Not to prolong Hopes (as
the Alchymists doe;) but indeed to give <i>Nature</i> a convenient Space
to worke in. These Principles are most certaine, and true; We will now
derive a direction of <i>Triall</i> out of them; Which may (perhaps) by
further Meditation, be improved.
<p>Let there be a <i>Small Furnace</i> made, of a <i>Temperate Heat</i>;
Let the <i>Heat</i> be such, as may keep the <i>Metall perpetually Moulten</i>,
and no more; For that above all importeth to the Work. For the Materiall,
take <i>Silver</i>, which is the <i>Metall</i> that in Nature Symbolizeth
most with <i>Gold</i>; Put in also, with the <i>Silver</i>, a Tenth Part
of <i>Quick-silver</i>, and Twelfth Part of <i>Nitre</i>, by weight; Both
these to quicken and open the Body of the <i>Metall</i>: And so let the
Worke be continued by the <i>Space of Sixe Monthes</i>, at the least. I
wish also, that there be, at some times, and Injection of some <i>Oyled</i>
Substance; such as they use in Recovering of <i>Gold</i>, which by Vexing
with Separations hath beene made Churlish: And this is, to lay the Parts
more Close and Smooth, which is the Maine Work. For <i>Gold</i> (as we
see) is the Closest (and therefore the Heaviest) of <i>Metalls</i>: And
is likewise the most Flexible and Tensible. Note, that to thinke to make
<i>Gold</i>
of <i>Quick-silver</i>, because it is the heaviest, is a Thing not to bee
hoped; For <i>Quick-silver</i> will not endure the Mannage of the <i>Fire</i>.
Next to <i>Silver</i>, I thinke <i>Copper</i> were fittest to bee the <i>Materiall</i>.
<p><i>Gold</i> hath these <i>Natures: Greatnesse of Weight; Closeness of
Parts; Fixation; Pliantnesse, </i>or <i>softnesse; Immunitie from Rust;
Colour</i> or <i>Tincture of Yellow</i>. Therefore the Sure Way, (though
most about,) to make <i>Gold</i>, is to know the <i>Causes</i> of the Severall
<i>Natures</i>
before rehearsed, and the <i>Axiomes</i> concerning the same. For if a
man can make a <i>Metall</i>, that hath all these <i>Properties</i>, Let
men dispute, whether it be <i>Gold</i>, or no?</blockquote>
