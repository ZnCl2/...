<blockquote>Gold, Sol, Sun, Brasse of Philosophers, the body of Magnesia,
a pure body, clean, ferment of Elixir, Masculine, Argent vive fixt, Sulphur
incombustible, Sulphur red, fixed, the rubibe stone, kybrik, a man, greene
vitrioll, burnt brasse, red earth: the water that is distilled from these
things, is named of the Philosophers, the taile of the Dragon, a pure wind,
ayre, life, lightning, the house, the afternoone light, virgin’s milke,
sal armoniack, sal niter, the wind of the belly, white fume, red water
of sulphur, tartar, saffron, water, the white compound, stinking water,
the filthiness of the dead bloud, Argent vive, a Cucurbite with his Alimbeck,
the vessell of the Philosophers, a high man with a Sallet, the belly of
a man in the midst, but in the end it is called the fot, or the feet, or
on the which feet, or earth is calcined, rosted, congealed, distilled,
or made still and quiet: the shaddow of the Sun, a dead body, a crowne
overcoming a cloud, the bark of the Sea, Magnesia, black, a Dragon which
eateth his tayle, the dregs of the belly, earth found on the dunghill putrefied,
or in horse dung, or in soft fire, Sulphur, Mercury, secondly in number,
and one in essence, name, in name, a stone, body, spirit and soule; it
is called earth, fire, aire, all things, because he contains in him foure
Elements; it is called a man or beast, that hath soul, life, body, and
spirit, and yet some Philosophers do not thinke the matter to have a soule.
<p>But as it is a stone, it is called the water of Sulphur, the Water of
the world, the spittle of Lune, the shadow of the Sun, a denne, Sol, Elephas,
white Jayre, eyes of fishes, Beyia, Sulphur, vine sharpe, water, milke,
vineger of life, tears, joyning water, Urine, the light of lights, a marvelous
Father, Father of Minerals, a fruitfull tree, a living spirit, a fugitive
servant, certore of the earth, venome, most strong vineger, white gumme,
everlasting water, a woman, a feminine, a thing of vile price, Azot, menstruous,
Brazill, in nature Azot, water, the first matter, the beginning of the
world; and mark this, that Argent vive, Mercury, Azot, the fulle moone,
Hypostasis, white lead, or red, do all of them signifie but one thing,
our stone, our brasse, our water, Iron, Silver, Lime, whiteness, Jupiter,
Vermilion white, after divers times and degrees of operation.
<p>And note, that the Philosophers washing is to bring again the whole
soule into his body, wherefore you may not understand thereby, the common
white washing is convenient to be done with vineger, and salt, and such
like. Also note, that when blackness doth appeare, then it is called dispensation
of the man and woman between them, and that the body hath gotten a spirit,
which is the tears of the vertues of the soule upon the body, and the body
doth revive the action of the soule and spirit, and is made an Eagle and
the meane of natures. And note, that white earth, white Sulphur, white
fume, Auripigmentum Magnesia, and Ethell, do signifie all one thing.
<p>Also the Stone is called Chaos, a Dragon, a Serpent, a Toad, the green
Lion, the quintessence, our stone Lunare, Camelion, most vild black, blacker
than black, Virgins milke, radicall humidity, unctuous moysture, liquor,
seminall, Salarmoniack, our Sulphur, Naptha, a soule, a Basilisk, Adder,
Secundine, Bloud, Sperme, Metteline, haire, urine, poyson, water of wise
men, minerall water, Antimony, stinking menstrues, Lead of Philosophers,
Sal, Mercury, our Gold, Lune, a bird, our ghost, dun Salt, Alome of Spaine,

cynaper, and almost with other infinite names of pleasure.</blockquote>
