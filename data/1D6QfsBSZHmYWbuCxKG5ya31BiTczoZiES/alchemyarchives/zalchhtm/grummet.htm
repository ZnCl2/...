  <p>Whosoever attempts the Search of our Glorious Stone, he ought in
the
first place, To Implore the assistance of the All powerful Jehova, at
the
Throne of his mercy, who is the true and Sole Author of all Mysteries
of
Nature; The Monarch of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, Omnipotent,
most True and Most Wise; who not only makes manifest (in the Macrocosm)
the truth of every Science to Worthy Philosophers, and liberally
bestows
both Natural and Divine Knowledge on the Deserving and Faithful; but
also
lays open his Treasures of Health and Riches (which are locked up in
the
Abyss of Nature) to those who devoutly worship Him. And forasmuch as
none
as none are permitted to touch the Mysteries of Nature with foul
Fingers;
therefore it behooves all who attempt such matters, to lay aside their
Natural Blinders (from which, by the Light of the Holy Scripture and a
steadfast Faith, they may be freed) that being the means by which the
Holy
Spirit doth clearly make manifest the most profoundly hidden light of
Nature;
which Light alone lays open the way to the Wisdom of Nature, and to
unlock
the most abstruse Mysteries thereof. </p>

  </center>
  <p>All the Masters of Alchemy, who have ever treated of this
celebrated
Stone, and left us anything in writing have declared the Matter and
Subject
(which is the chief part of this Art) so obscurely, that Apollo himself
would be tired in unwinding the Enigma&#8217;s they have excogitated
concerning
it. And this doubtful Declaration of the Matter is the reason why many
who seek this Science without the Light of Nature, are precipitated
into
very great Errors; because they know not the true Subject of this At,
but
busy themselves about other things altogether unfit for the Work. But
they
ought to consider what the Philosophers&#8217; Stone is in its own Nature,
and
what qualities of their Matters with the qualities of the Stone, the
Thing
itself will discover what is Truth and what is not. </p>
  <p>1. The Stone in its Perfection is permanent in the Fire, and
despises
the most extreme violence of the Flames. </p>
  <p>2. It containeth in itself, in great abundance the Vital Fire, and
the
Virtues and Powers of the Superiors and Inferiors concentrated in it. </p>
  <p>3. It is resolvable in any Liquor. </p>
  <p>4. It abounds with fixed and Tingeing Spirits, which before its
Compleat
Perfection were Volatile. </p>
  <p>5. Before its Perfection it hath two distinct parts, one volatile,
the
other fixt. </p>
  <p>6. It is of most easy fusion. </p>
  <p>7. It contains the three Principles of Nature in the highest
purity,
namely Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. </p>
  <p>8. It contains in Potentia Gold and Silver. </p>
  <p>9. It is made of One Thing. </p>
  <p>Seeing the Stone hath the qualities above mentioned, it is plain
and
evident that the subject of it ought to have the like --- namely: </p>
  <p>1. That the Subject of the Stone be only One Thing. </p>
  <p>2. That it have in it, in potentia, Gold and Silver. </p>
  <p>3. That it contain in it the Three Principles of Nature. </p>
  <p>4. That it be of most easy fusion. </p>
  <p>5. That it consist of volatile and fixt parts. </p>
  <p>6. That it abound with Tinctures both red and white. </p>
  <p>7. That it be resolvable in any Liquor. </p>
  <p>8. That it be the place of residence of the vital fire, and the
Virtues
of the Superiors and Inferiors. </p>
  <p>9. That it endure the most utmost force of the Flames. </p>
  <p>Now let the Seekers compare the qualities of their Subjects with
the
forementioned qualities, and then they will see whether they are right
or wrong. </p>
  <p>I know there are many who will not approve of this Description of
our
Subject; especially Those who are wholly employed about Antimony,
Vitriol,
vulgar Mercury, the perfect Metals, Marchasites, Vegetables, Animals,
Stones,
and other like things, all which are by no means comparable to our
Subject,
part of which things are either partly or wholly volatile, or wholly
combustible
and inseparable by any means or by any Liquor, unless perhaps they are
resolvable by a Corrosive. All Philosophers do declare that the
knowledge
of this Divine Science consists in the Knowledge of the Elements and
their
occult Operations&#8217; which is a certain Truth, and it were to be wished
that
those, who employ their thoughts about the above-mentioned principles,
would study this Saying, and follows its direction; There would not
then
be so many Sophisters, and so few Philosophers; and they would do well
to seek out one of the Ancient Philosophers who expounds the Elements,
and their occult Operations. But this is scarce found in any one, or if
perhaps it is to be found, yet by reason of the obscure Style of the
Author,
it meets with incredulous Disciples. </p>
  <p>And therefore for the Sake of some good men, who perhaps bear an
honest
mind, I will discourse something of the Elements, and their operations,
and first and chiefly of the mover of the Elements, and of its Life;
which
not being known the whole operation of the Elements is unknown. </p>
  <p>This Mover of the Elements which, not without good reason, I will
call
the living Fire, is two-fold, the one Volatile, the other Fixed,
residing
in the Center of the Earth, o which at present I will not speak, but of
the Volatile; which is a substance Invisible, Spiritual, and wholly
Fiery,
an Eternal Light nearest to God, the Life of the Elements, from which
the
Sun and Moon, the radiant Stars, and whatsoever gives forth as a Luster
in the Heavens, takes its Original and Splendour, flying through the
Universe,
every where present, and most of all in those Things which stand in
need
of continual Nourishment, endowed with innumerable Virtues. This
Celestial
Light is originally most pure in itself, as long as it is not defiled
by
impure bodies, the Knowledge thereof is the Sea of Wisdom, which all
who
have obtained Light from the Holy spirit, and Faith from the Father of
Lights, ought to keep safe, if thou desire a happy Success in this
Mysterious
Philosophy. This Light descends daily into the Elements, which are
Bodies
internally Spiritual, very simple, and most powerful, which contain in
themselves a certain Seminal Spirit, which is the very Element; and
which
Spirit of every Element is stirred up to motion by the living Fire; and
if it were absent, the Elements would be dead, especially the Fire, if
it were deprived of this fiery Splendour, which by itself, and not by
accident
is the true Principle in Motion in all Things; and to this the passive
Elements are obedient. But yet this Agent cannot act without the
Elements,
nor the Elements upon one another without it. For this cause the
Elements
were made, by the most High Creator, which together with their Body
contain
a certain Seminal Spirit, very powerful, which lieth hid as a Soul in
them,
out of which by the Action of the living Fire upon it, daily new seeds
are produced This Living Fire, with which the Heavens and all things
are
filled by the Creator, descends through the Elements into the Subject,
which is called the balsam of Nature, Electrum Immaturum, Magnesia, the
Green Dragon, Azoth Vitreous, the Fire of nature, the Universal Seed,
the
Salt of the Earth, out of which all Bodies which consist of the
Elements
are produced by Nature; and out of this Matter, by the administration
of
an ingenious Artist, by means of a spagyric destruction, new forms of
Natural
bodies may be produced; which is one of the greatest Arcana of Secret
Philosophy.
For in this Subject lie hidden all the Virtues, properties, and
Splendours
of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, Metals and Precious Stones; which
by help of Vulcan, are brought from Darkness to Light. </p>
  <p>Now I will describe the action of our Living Fire upon the
Elements,
which descends out of the Fire into the heavens as an Element of Fire,
and there whatsoever is lucid or glistening, as the Sun, Moon and
Stars,
doth secretly derive its Original from this Living Fire, and
constituteth
this principal Element, and obeys it as a Son the Father, and a Patient
its Agent, And from this Living Fire, the Heaven hath its chief power
of
acting; and is of so great consequence, that if its action upon the
Heaven
should cease for one moment of time, whole Nature would be ruined. For
the Sun, Moon and Stars would lose their active and influential Virtue,
the Elements would not move, and nothing for ever would have any
Action;
which would be a great mischief to the Earth, and extremely hurtful to
all Mixts. For the Power and Virtue of this Living Fire is so great,
that
if it were absent, the Elements would be dead, especially the Heaven,
an
Element which most of all stands in need of this Light. Having passed
through
the Heaven, it comes into the Air, that great work this Element, and
insinuates
itself most intimately into it. In this Element the Virtue of this Fire
doth chiefly manifest itself; because in it is inspissated, and
constitutes
the vital Air; which Air is this agreeable to the Creatures, for
sustaining
of Life. For this Living Fire simply is not convenient for the
Creatures,
nor yet the simple Air; but Fire concealed with the most pure part of
the
Air, and Air impregnated with the Celestial Living Fire; and so they
constitute
vital Airs, which every living Creature receives for the Conservation
of
its life. This living Fire needs the Soul of the Elements, chiefly of
the
Air, which it makes use of for a Vehicle, that thereby it may more
easily
enter into the other Elements, that is to say first the Water, a subtle
and this Element, in which it is yet more inspissated, and takes a more
gross Body of which it stands in need for irrorating of all Terrestrial
Things, especially Salts, Minerals and Stones; all which need such
irroration
[?]; thus being clothed with a thick garment, it passeth into the
Earth,
a dark and thick Element, and of a very powerful fixing Virtue; and
there
it puts on a saline Body, which predominates over all things, and
contains
the rest of the Principles, which it had received in the Air, heaven
and
Water, that is to say, Sulphur and Mercury, by virtue of which it
becomes
capable of Production. This Salt is the Soul of the Earth, and all
other
Things. </p>
  <p>Therefore if the Earth were deprived of this Salt, it would want
the
Power of sprouting and budding, which consists only in this Salt; of
which
also Moses was not ignorant, Saying (in the second Chapter of Genesis)
And there went up a mist from the middle of the Earth, and watered the
superficies of the ground; which vapour can be nothing else but the
subtle
parts
of this Salt, which hath settled itself in the Center of the Earth, and
by the warmth of the Corporeal Water are made to ascend, and so do
Water
the whole Superficies. </p>
  <p>Thus we clearly and evidently see, that this living Fire puts on
no
other Body than that of Salt; because that alone is fit for generation,
and so the Balsam of Nature is generated by the action of the Fire upon
the Elements. </p>
  <p>Now I will speak but a very little of the fixed Living Fire, which
is
hidden in the Earth or Center of the World, and there hath taken up its
most fixed habitation; but it may better be called the Fire of Bodies.
To know this is the most Secret Mystery in all our Philosophy. This
fixt
Fire hath a great Sympathy with the volatile Fire; for it wants it as
an
aliment, and to its Nourishment, which is continually attracted out of
the Water and Air, and converted into its own Substance; and in this as
in a Center all the Virtue lies concentrated, which being scattered,
flies
in the Circumference; as may be observed in Man, in whom this Fire
fixed
in the Center of the Heart, hath its seat as the Yolk in the Egg. But
its
operation is invisible and very Secret, and yet very powerful, which
also
few know; for it operates by its heat in all things, which lie in the
Earth,
and excites the Flux and reflux of the Sea, as the Pulse in man is
excited
by the Fire which lies hid in the Center of his Heart. Hence also all
the
Watery and Airy Vapours, which compose the Clouds, and by rarefaction
of
the Winds (being impregnated by the Vital Spirit) fall down again to
the
Earth in the form of water. And thus every Searcher of Nature must
acknowledge
it to be true, that there is only one subject under the concave of the
Moon, in which alone the Virtues as well of the Superiors as of the
Inferiors,
lie concentrated; out of which by the Chemical Art, Stupendous things
may
be brought to pass. </p>
  <p>This Body is Salt, but not common Salt, or any other Salt of this
kind,
but a Saturnine and Mineral Salt, which hath chosen to itself a
residence
in the Sphere o Saturn, and is also called the Heart of Saturn; out of
which being made clean and bright, and purified from all Excrements, by
an easy Art, a certain gummy Liquor is drawn, called by the Name of
Glorious
Mercury. But you must be very wary in the choice of this Salt, there is
only one Salt which is useful to us, a pontick fiery, bitter and
Mineral
Salt of a Saturnine Nature, out of which this famous Liquor is
extracted;
which if of so great moment, that without it, no Transmutation of
Metals
can be made. In this Mercurial Liquor may be seen what is Sulphur and
Mercury;
for the Sulphur at first shows itself in a Purple and Yellow Colour;
but
the Mercury is invested with a watery and Airy humidity; and though the
Salt appears not, yet its Virtue is eminent in this Liquor. </p>
  <p>For it is whlly Saline, and an easie Fire is coagulated into a
permanent
Earth, which represents Salt. </p>
  <p>And so you have Three Principles of Nature, Salt, Sulphur and
Mercury. </p>
  <p>These are but a few things which I have said of the Matter, which
though
it be very secret, yet its Operation is more secret which nevertheless
in my following Discourse I will reveal, so that its occult may be made
manifest only to Men Elected by God. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter III</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>I have said before, that the living Fire (with which the Heaven
and
the Elements are filled by the Creator) doth secretly descend into the
subject which is the balsam of Nature, and the absolute Subject of the
Philosophers&#8217; Stone; whose nine properties I have declared, and which I
think fit a little to unfold; in the search of which the ancient
Philosophers
were very long employed. This Natural Body appears by the Writings
which
they have left us; out of which the modern Rout of Alchemists who seek
the Golden Stone, have conceived as many Chimeras as their brains could
reach; whereof some affirm that the Concretes of the Vegetables and
Animal
Kingdom, others that Minerals as Antimony, Sulphur and Marchasites, and
the rest of the Minerals; others, that Metals themselves, Gold and
Silver;
but others of a more Subtle wit, that Vitriol and common slat is the
Subject
of the Glorious Stone; which opinions the Sincere Searchers of Nature
ought
to leave free to their Authors; and let him know by the Light of Nature
and Experience, that the chief Error of these Smatterers in Chymistry
is,
that they falsely persuade themselves, that there are divers Subjects
of
this Art, contrary to the several Rules of the Philosophers, who teach
clearly, that there is only one Subject, and say that this is
compounded
of the Four Elements, and the three Principles of Nature compose their
Stone, by which they delude these foolish Chemical Novices. For they
say,
the Stone is made of one Things, of Two, of Three, and of Four: By
which
Contradictions they declare to the Sons of Art, and Pious Searcher this
only wonderful Subject of this Art. For immediately this Thing which
composes
the Stone is but one; which is divided into a fixt and a Volatile, into
an Agent and a Patient, and so it is Two; and although it be so
divided,
yet it doth by no means lose its Unity. </p>
  <p>So also when it is divided into Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, and so
is
Three-fold, neither doth this Division destroy its Unity; much less
doth
the Division into four Elements do so, And though this matter be
common,
yet it is not known to these Novices in Chemistry, who seek it among
Animals,
Vegetables, and partly Minerals but they know not that in these it is
already
determined; among the Minerals, the chief are Antimony, vulgar Mercury,
and Vitriol. In Antimony indeed there is found a Mercury, but too
Combustible
(read Coagulated); and also a Sulphur, but too Combustible. In Vitriol
there is also a Mercurial Nature, but too Acid, and hath no
incombustible
Sulphureous Salt. In Mercury and other Minerals there is found a
useless
proportion both of Sulphur and Mercury, of which the greatest part is
in
part wholly Volatile, or wholly Combustible, and so is not fit for this
Art, but our only Minera, which is enclosed in an Earthy Substance, out
of which may be plentifully drawn the Philosophers Aqua Permanens,
whose
Virtues are also powerful as well in Art as in Medicine, in no sort
Venomous,
but it is the chief Purger of Human Bodies, by Urine and Sweat, the
highest
Medicine for the Venereal Disease, Cancers, leprosy, Fistulas, and
other
incurable Diseases. And its Virtue is great in a Quartane, the Dropsy,
Stone, Gout; it most powerfully resists all Poisons and Philters. </p>
  <p>But of what kind this Matter is, which is endowed with such
Virtue,
and out of which is plentifully drawn the famous Philosophical mercury,
I have sufficiently demonstrated in the preceding Chapter, and herein
will
further demonstrate; which is not properly Mineral not Vegetable or
Animal;
yet a Metalline Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, are together purely and
plentifully
in it, which is obvious to every one, and lieth hidden in everything,
but
especially in the earth, the receptacle of all the influences, in which
also the Virtues of the Sun, Moon, and Stars are found corporeally.
This
the Artist ought to take where it is most near and most pure, in the
form
of a Triune Salt, which elsewhere I called the Salt of Saturn: Out of
this
Salt grows Gold, and all other things, in the whole Mineral Kingdom,
into
it they may be resolved again. And as in Gold lies hidden a bright
diaphanous
Sulphur, so also in our Saturnine Minera, there is a celestial Solar
Fiery,
Diaphanous red and sweet Sulphur --- For where there is glittering
brightness,
there is light; where is light, there is Heat; where is Heat there is
Life
and very powerful Action; and which is a great matter, in it reign its
Elements animated with a living Fire, which is a Celestial vivifying,
Fertile
and greening Spirit; the Light, Force and Life of all things. </p>
  <p>And although the Celestial Sun doth much help the production of
Sublunary
Creatures, yet without this Internal Sun nothing can be generated;
which
also the philosophers knew. Therefore all other Concretes are rejected,
as also Salts, except one which is the Salt of Wisdom, Power and
Strength,
and the Mother of the other Salts, namely our Central Saturnine Salt, a
Sulphureous and Mercurial Salt; whose Heart and Blood doth easily
dissolve
every metal, and coagulate Mercury. </p>
  <p>The Fire as Sol and Luna, though they appear not to sight, yet
they
are powerfully in the inward parts of our matter, and it possesses the
Seminal Virtue of all Things; so also that unless what is hidden in it
be made manifest, they will not appear; which is done only by reduction
and purification of the matter, that the Feces (which beclouded our Sol
and Luna) may be thoroughly purged away, and the matter may first grow
white as a Diamond, and be as fulgent as a Ruby, then they appear to
sight.
Which reduction must be made with a certain contrary Liquor; for Sol
and
Luna, which are secretly in our Matter, and rule powerfully in it, are
not reduced so as to appear to sight, unless this reduction is made by
a contrary, which is a Menstruum or Most Subtile Vapour, penetrating
and
resolving, containing in it Air, Fire, and Water, and separating the
pure
from the impure, and yet first extracted out of our Minera; which
Liquor
possesses only power of reducing, manifesting, and multiplying
Tinctures;
and therefore it is called the Secret Fire of Nature, which alone
excites
and perfects Tinctures. But yet we must not therefore suppose that the
Subject is red or any other colour, but it is white apparently, and red
only in Potential; because this nature of redness lieth secretly hidden
in the Belly of the Air of our Matter, not showing its Tincture
visibly,
because if it be put into the Fire, it cannot manifest a fixed
Tincture,
unless it be first reduced by an ingenious Artist, so that the Watery
and
Earthy heterogeneous Substances may be separated; then appears a
Tincture
resisting the Fire, and showing itself in it White and Red. </p>
  <p>The certainty of this Solar Subject may be evidently known, if out
of
it the three principles of Nature can be separated. What they are I
will
explain. </p>
  <p>Sulphur residing in our Matter, is its fiery, most subtle, and
most
thin part, partaking of a subtle Earth, which indeed is the perfect and
absolute Tincture, having power of rubifying and illuminating every
Body,
by reason of its innate oily, very fat, unctuous and viscous, fiery and
ethereal quality; upon which account it is able by its subtle and
internal
action to produce all Natural Things. Which Sulphur is called the
Philosophers&#8217;
Secret Fire, the Living Fire, in the luminous part, etc.: Therefore if
anyone in the Anatomy of our Matter see a certain shining, subtle,
clear
Substance, full of a fiery shining redness like a Ruby, and full of
active
Virtue, he may be certain that he hath seen our Sulphur, and the Secret
Fire of the Philosophers. Mercury is the Aerial and unctuous humidity
of
our Matter, and the inseparable Companion of Sulphur, and is as a
Menstruum
to it, cherishing and nourishing it, and a Medium of conjoining the
Sulphur
with the Salt; but the reason why it is Viscous as Sulphur, is, because
it hath subtile Earthy parts resolved in it, which it took with it in
the
Anatomy made by external Fire. The Salt is the Principle of
coagulation;
and coagulates the mercury and the Sulphur, and in which a new form is
introduced by the action of the Sulphur which operates in it, which
Sulphur
is very bitter and acid, in which bitterness there is a certain fiery
Substance
corrupting the inward parts of the Salt, and which being corrupted
immediately
it receives a new form, and that a living one, which is a great Secret.
  </p>
  <p>These Principles are also very much defiled with heterogeneous
Feces;
which an Artist ought to know. Sulphur in the first place, abounds with
destructive and consuming Feces; But the Mercury with watery and cold
substances
contrary to life; and in Salt there are caustic, viscous and bitter
Salts;
all
which must be separated and if not, they occasion damage and unlucky
Success
to the Work. This one Minera is of easy fusion, so as it can catch
Mercury
upon the fire before his flight; which if it be circulated by the
Philosophers&#8217;
Wheel, so that those parts which hinder speedy fusion be separated, and
the Elements firmly coagulated, it becomes of more easy fusion than it
was before; which fusion depends upon the Saline and Sulphurous
Spirituality,
which is a perfect and concentrated Light, penetrating every Body and
on
all Sides illuminating it with the Tingeing Rays with which it abounds.
The Spagyrical Art by Distillation and Separation, affords us Two
Sulphurs
out of one Minera of a Saturnine Nature; one is volatile and green, the
other fixt and fiery, which two by circulating their Elements were made
one, which Sulphurs are of the Nature of Salt produced by Nature out of
the most pure Soul of the Elements. Because by the mixture of the
living
Fire and this Soul, these Sulphurs are produced in the greater World,
out
of which by the Chemical Art the two Sulphurs of the Philosophers are
extracted,
which consist of the most subtile and pure part of the Sulphurs
produced
by Nature. Out of this pure Substance Metals are also generated, which
differ only according to the purity of the place, and the more or less
fit disposition. Out of these Two Minerals is plentifully extracted the
mercury of the Philosophers, which is their Radical Humidity mixt with
a Subtile Earth. For as by this Earthy Sulphur is meant heat and fire
of
Nature, as also the forms of the Matter, which we also call Sulphur. So
also the Humidity if this Substance is our Sulphur, in which (if they
be
joined by Art in a certain proportion, and are decocted in a glass
Vessel,
circulating their Elements; first Water, then Air, Fire and Earth, and
then they are purified by reduction into a certain chaotic, thick and
viscous
Mass; then by Distillation into Liquor, one white, another red and
shining
as fire; lastly they are fixed into a glorious and permanent Earth)
consists
all our Art. Sulphur is the principal part of our Tincture, and that
which
plentifully bears rule in our Matter, is two-fold, as we have declared,
white and red, fixed and volatile. The fixt is the Green Lion; which
lies
hid in the center of our Concrete, abounding with fixt and tingeing
Tinctures,
but the volatle is the Fire of Nature and our Sulphur, full of Power
and
Efficacy of Tingeing and illuminating, as this testament doth
manifestly
declare. For it is the blood of our Green Dragon, distilled from the
very
Bowels of it, abounding with redness; therefore it is not without
cause,
called the blood of Nature, which stirs up its own Sulphur, lying his
in
an Earthy Substance, and brings it from Power into Act; and them out of
it do arise our two glorious Mercuries, our two perfect Sulphurs, one
red,
the Husband; the other white, the Wife; Springing out of one Minera.
And
that Sulphur which we call the Green Lion, is the Fire of Nature, which
lieth hid in the Center of our Subject, understand Salt, and there is
detained
shut up in a strong Earthy Prison, disabled to exert its force, unless
by its associate it be set at liberty from its Fetters, so that it may
come out together with his Companion. This deliverance consists in
Solution,
which is very difficult, for this Sulphur which we also call the Stone,
is both most hard and most soft in its Nature, and therefore it is not
easily dissolved, except in its own Liquor, that is his Companion in
which
it is most soft; so that it can be set at liberty only by this aery
Companion,
which otherwise could not be delivered, neither by Fire nor Water;
which
is a Secret known to a few, of which I will speak more particularly
hereafter. </p>
  <p>This fixt Sulphur is very powerful, and sustains every thing that
operates
in Nature, but as soon as it is set free, it ceases from its Labour, if
together with its Companion it be carried aloft, and in to Top of the
Vessel,
where if they are detained, they constitute a certain Substance bright
as Lune, called Diana; at this time I say, it receives the power of
Transmuting.
Since the Stone is of the Substance of Salt, it resolves itself in any
Liquor; but the Salt, out of which it is prepared is of most profound
research,
and differs much from other Salts; for it is fluid in the fire, and
values
not its martyrdom at all, and loses nothing of its Virtue therein,
though
it be kept in it divers years, which other Salts, as Vitriol, Sal
Gemma,
and other like Salts, cannot do; for by often repeating ignitions, they
all turn to an unprofitable and unfluxable Calx, being of the Nature of
damned Earth. Though the Matter to sight is most vile and most cold,
yet
its more inward parts are of the Superiors and Inferiors, and therefore
its Soul flies in all places to bring down the Living Fire. For the
Father
of it is the Sun, and the Mother the Moon, from which it secretly
derives
the Virtues of all things. This Living Fire rules powerfully in our two
Radical Sulphurs, fixed and volatile; which two being firmly united, do
constitute our Universal mercury, which contains in itself the two
Central
Fires of the Macrocosm, the Celestial and Terrestrial; and these two,
by
the help of External Fire, are reduced into one Substance, in which the
Celestial and Terrestrial Virtues lie concentrated, which heat is the
innate
heat of everything, which often shows its splendour in the Eyes of
Fishes,
Hairs of Brutes and Men, in Insects generated out of Dew, as also in
rotten
Wood; but I think it is sufficient, that every one daily sees the
luster
of Gold and Silver, Pearls and precious Stones, and also beholds the
Sun
and Moon. Lastly, it is to be considered, that the Tincture of the
Philosophers,
is a substance Tingeing imperfect Metals in a very strong Fire, into
perfect
Gold and Silver, from whence it necessarily follows, that its Subject
ought
also constantly to resist the Flames, and to rejoice in them. But it is
not the whole Substance of the First Matter which endures the Fire;
because
it abounds with many Elementary Feces, which are combustible in the
Fire;
but only its pure parts, which are also called incombustible Oils,
rejoice
in the Fire, and are not defiled with any Feces, therefore the Fire
cannot
touch them. Wherefore it is necessary in the first place, to purify the
matter, and take away the Sphere of Saturn, which beclouds the Sun and
Moon, before they be reduced into one Thing, whose Virtues neither
Fire,
nor Water, nor Iron, nor Air, can diminish, but they, unvanquished,
resist
all their force. Consider therefore, O Man, the Wisdom and Power, which
the most Wise, Eternal, and Omnipotent God, Jehova, hath granted thee.
Consider these things in Humility of Heart, and Sing Hallelujahs to him
without ceasing, for, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord Zeboath; the
Heavens
and the Earth are full of the Majesty of His Glory. Amen. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter IV</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>We have spoken copiously of divers things necessary to this Art;
but
we will speak yet more, and things more necessary, among which is the
Solution
of Gold into Water, which is the beginning of making our Divine
Mercury,
and that is, to convert the hard and soft Nature of our Gold, into a
thin
and Watery Substance, with Conservation of the Internal Nature, and
Property
of Gold. For if this internal Sulphur should be corrupted and
destroyed,
it would not be a Physical, but a Sophistical Operation; but that which
we desire to perform, ought to be done with our corrosive pontic bitter
and sharp Mercury, which imitates the Natures of Sol and Luna, with
which
We truly dissolve; because our Sulphur is hard and kept close in the
Prison
of its Excrements; therefore this Substance ought to set it at liberty
and extract it, in the mean time by the same operation we also calcine,
reduce, dissolve and putrefy the Gold. For if we calcine, the Fire
burns
the Heterogeneous fetid and viscid parts, full of life, and so
attenuates
them, that thereby they become of more easy Solution. But nothing doth
more destroy and conserve these parts, than our pontic and corrosive
Mercury,
by reason of its fiery Nature wherewith it abounds, which also the
Philosophers
call the Fire of Nature; and if they speak of Fire, they mean this
Water,
and not common ravenous culinary Fire, as appears in their Books, when
they say, Burn Our Copper with very hot Fire. Azoth and Fire are
sufficient
to burn Laton, and et this burning is done with a gentle Fire, for with
a very strong one it would be destroyed, because our Mercury being
tender
and full of Fire, which would make it fly away from our hard and
unattenuated
Gold, and the Gold would remain undissolved, and if it were dissolved,
it would ascend with its Mercury in the form of a red ponderous Water. </p>
  <p>Therefore also in this Operation two Works are performed; namely,
a
coagulation of Mercury, or of the fiery Substance into a red Mineral
and
viscous Water, and a Solution and conversion of Gold into the same
Water;
which the Philosophers hint when they say, that Mercury cannot be
coagulated
unless the Sulphur be dissolved; and on the other side, the Sulphur
cannot
be dissolved unless the Mercury be coagulated; they must mutually act
one
upon another for the performing of this Operation (for gold, which is
hard
and strongly compacted, needs this Subtle and Aereal Mercury) which if
it be accomplished, out of it is generated, by putrefaction, a middle
water,
powerful in Tinctures, which is that permanent Water which the
Philosophers
so earnestly desire; that is to say, that with which, and the glorious
Salt, is generated a certain Substance which we call Diana regenerated,
and the triumphing Sulphur of Nature. </p>
  <p>And it is to be noted, that this regenerated Diana is generated of
the
fiery Salt and fiery Water, leaving behind it unprofitable Ashes, and
is
so fiery and penetrant, that it can burn Gold; and without it no Elixir
is made. For in our glorious Salt there is a certain Virtue which is
fiery,
subtle, penetrant, and most mighty in Power, which is found in its last
and utmost destruction, in which is the Virtue and power of multiplying
Gold: and it is so powerful, that this Virtue can neither be burned by
the vehemence of a calcining fire, nor be extinguished by the coldness
of the dissolving and washing Water, nor be stirred by any force of the
Winds; and therefore, saith a certain philosopher in these words: Our
Stone
is alone ponderous, unmoved by Fire, unmoved by Water, unmoved by wind;
and it is also most light, hollow and spongeous, moved by fire, moved
by
water, moved by wind, because it is moved and altered by the spirit
which
is called Fire, which is called Air, which is called Wind. </p>
  <p>Our Gold is not vulgar Gold, which is sold by goldsmiths, or
anything
like it, but it is a certain other substance more precious than Gold
itself,
whose green and golden Colour doth sufficiently demonstrate its
original
and Excellence. This Green Gold in its first root is clothed with a
foul
Garment, which must be separated by dissolving it by help of Mercury of
Gold, first extracted out of Gold, and abounding with a bright golden
Sulphur;
which alone is capable of performing this Solution; because it
dissolves
nothing but the golden nature of Gold, which is of its own Nature. But
the Earth adhering to Gold, which is of its own Nature. But the Earth
adhering
to Gold is not of a golden nature, and therefore is not dissolved by
this
Solvent, but falls to the bottom of the circulatory Vessel, in form of
a muddy and viscous matter, very like to the Sediment of Urine, and is
easily separated from the dissolved Gold. But this Golden Mercury is
wonderfully
intricate to be searched out, and though it be found everywhere, yet it
is most difficult to be found, by those who know it not, thought easy
to
those who know it, and know its Nature exactly. For it is a white and
serene,
ponderous, Acid and pontic Liquor, of an ethereal Substance, which is
sublimed
with a most gentle fire, and converted into Air, and there in a glass
Vessel
turns into Water, which is that so celebrated Animal, Vegetable, and
Mineral
Mercury, which the Ancient Philosophers knew, especially Lully, who
doth
not without cause, call it red Wine, and Lunary. For it doth not alone
constitute the Essence of these three Kingdoms, but also the heaven
itself;
and all the Heavenly and Earthly Natures have their Being and
Conservation
from this Spirit and Watery Substance, by reason of its living fire
with
which it abounds, and without which no Creature can live. </p>
  <p>Therefore the Ancients call it a fiery vigor, the natural living
fire,
Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral; by which all things in the Air, Water,
and Earth, which have life, are nourished, and which failing they die;
by which substance is performed the True solution of our Gold, and by
no
other; because all other Waters are Heterogeneous to our Gold, and
therefore
not fit for our Work. Of this kind of Gold we have spoken. Now I will
also
say something of the Body, which is a certain, Saline, Sulphureous,
fixed
and permanent Matter, which must be dissolved with a Philosophic
Menstruum,
else all the pains is lost, which are taken in any Operations, and they
are all Vain who boast of such a Tincture, without this Menstrous and
permanent
Liquor, which alone is able for penetration, Subtilization, and
depuration
of this body, and reducing it to the highest Purity. For this Water was
before naturally included in this Body; which if it be again poured
upon
it, it opens its Pores, and attenuates without any inward hurt; because
it is of the same nature with the Body, so that it can do nothing else
but nourish and conserve it. This Water is extracted out of the very
Bowels
of our Matters; for even our Body was Water before, and by Nature, by
means
of the internal fire, is reduced into a Body, which is easily reduced
and
resolved by its own Water, whose Nature it before had, which if they
are
dissolved and decocted by fire of the first degree, convert themselves
into a viscous fiery penetrant Substance, which by further operation
passes
into an Earth, which by the Philosophers is called the black Earth of
Magnesia,
whose Operation they have hidden with the utmost envy. Our humid
Mercury,
which contains the fire of the Elements, is extracted out of our only
Minera,
by force of an external fire, which being highly purified, is poured
again
upon the Body and conjoined with it so purified, and works lying upon
it,
until at last it exalts it to a higher degree; namely, into Luna of
Luna,
which being again dissolved and putrefied with our Water, affords us a
permanent Water, which resolves all Metallic Bodies, yea, and Precious
Stones; with which Water, and our glorious Earth, we prepare our Two
Sulphurs
and Tinctures both white and red. </p>
  <p>But that this operation may be more easily understood by all,
imitate
the following Manner. </p>
  <p><b>Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take our Corporeal Mercury, Animal, Vegetable and Mineral, pure
and
purged by the fire from all Excrements, and put it into a glass Vessel,
stopping it very firmly, and digest it by assation, till the bloody
Pores
of this Body be opened, then take it dry and dissolve it in Aqua
Foetida,
white and ponderous, which is also Vegetable: digest it for some time
till
it appear a dry mass. Dissolve this again and filter it well, decoct it
till the whole be resolved into a bloody Liquor. Shining and ponderous;
circulate this Wheeling about and extracting it into a liquid, hard and
this Substance which is our Mercury, with which gold and Silver are
burnt
into Ashes. A great and wonderful Mystery, known only to Adepts; the
Secret
Knowledge of which Earthly Mercury, Hermes hath shown in his Table,
Saying,
His Father is the Sun, and his mother the Moon, the Wind carries it in
its Belly, the Earth is its Nurse; it ascends from Earth to Heaven, and
again descends into the Earth, and receives the Virtues of the
Superiors
and Inferiors, its Virtue is entire, if it be turned into Earth. </p>
  <p>Out of which Earth is our Mercury Sublimed, glorious and fixed, is
made
our Elixir. </p>
  <p>Now let us return to the Water, by means of which this our
Subtilization
is made; which is a certain Water very subtle and precious, acid,
fetid,
corrosive and sharp, which the Ancients hid under the Name of Vinegar,
as also of other acid and fiery Liquors, as of Aqua Fortis, Vitriol,
Alum,
Salt-petre, and Sal Armoniac; by which our Body is made Subtle, and
reduced
into the next mater of the Stone, which is a Viscous and muddy Water,
fiery
and full of tinctures, With which the Stone sublimed, Viscid and fixed
into Earth is fed, that it may ascend to a Royal Dignity. Which Secret,
namely of subtlizing our Body, the Ancient Philosophers would not
reveal,
but left it to God to reveal it to whom he pleased; nevertheless they
left
in writing among the Rubbish, some hints how that middle Substance
which
they named with many Names) and yet is the Key and Foundation of this
Subtilization,
of which Water it is said in Turba, Our Body must be environed with the
Flames of our red fume and be broken by it, as being a fire against
Nature;
for by this Water, which is full of Fire, Our Body is washed till it be
also made a Mineral or permanent Water. </p>
  <p>But that I may give you an Epitome of this Chapter, I say, That
the
whole World of our Subtilization consists in Vapour and Water, which is
called Whitening and purifying water; which I divide into two parts,
namely
the water of the two Zaybeths, white and red, whereof one calcines the
Body, and in calcinations coagulates itself with it; but the other
purifies
it from its blackness, whitens and rubifies, and at last makes it
volatile.
Which water is called Acetum Acerrimum, because it is very sharp and
acid.
This Humidity also contains in itself an unchangeable Tincture, which
can
by no means be extinguished. This Water is called Aqua Vitae,
Vegetable,
Animal, Spirit of Wine, Strong Vinegar, Saturnal Water, and many other
names. </p>
  <p>But the Artist, who endeavors to set upon this work, must know
that
every Body is dissolved by a sharp Spirit, and made volatile with a
Spirit;
and if the Spirit be so prepared by the help of the Body, our Mercury
is
prepared, which purifies, washes, and fixes and incerates itself, till
at last it attains to the highest Subtility and purity, and sublimes
itself
from the bottom of the Vessel into white Stone. This must be separated
from its Feces, by sublimation and reduction; and then will be prepared
the Foliated Earth more white than Snow, which after its due Decoction,
coagulates and fixes vulgar Mercury, and transmutes every imperfect
Body
into true Luna. This most precious Whiteness is our Arsenic, an
incomparable
Treasure, which above all other things the Philosopher needs. This
Sulphur
must be calcined, till it be converted into a dry and very subtle
powder;
which Powder must be imbibed with the white Oil of the Philosophers
divers
times, till at length it flows like wax and then there will be prepared
the White Stone, whereof one part Tinges a Thousand parts of any Metal,
into true Silver. </p>
  <p>Thus it appears clearly, That all that can be desired in
Philosophy,
may be extracted out of only the Body, and its own Sulphureous Mercury,
which two with the help of the fire, accomplish all things; and he who
understands these two, understands all that is necessary to our Art.
Though
the Philosophers say many things of divers matters, yet they mean
nothing
else but these two Sulphurs, which for the sake of the Sons of Art, I
will
explain. </p>

  <p>Among the Secrets of Alchemy, the greatest is to draw Water out of
a
Rock; Verily a hard and very difficult Work, unless Chymistry alone had
shewed us the possibility of this thing; which the Artist ought to
endeavor
to do by Fire, which in the beginning must be gentle, in the middle
strong,
and in the end most vehement; so that all the Aereal and Ethereal
Spirits
of Rocky Minera, may issue forth into a fit Philosophical Vessel, and
there
resolve themselves into water; which water with wonderful Sympathy
loves
the Rock, from whence it issued; which Water is called by various
names,
as Rock-Water, Argent Vive, A Fume, The Tingeing Celestial Spirit,
Incombustible
Sulphur, Wine Vinegar, Succus Acacia, Spirit of Wine, Temperate Water,
the Luciferous Virgin: all which Names signify this water; which if it
be again conjoined with it, remains Stone, and often operates resting
upon
it, it acquires a wonderful active Power, as all know who are
acquainted
with this Water. This operation is also called by the Philosophers, a
destruction
of the Compound; which destruction is not to destroy as the Vulgar
Chemists
think, who destroy Mixts by Corrosives, but by the unlocking the Bonds
of our Compound, by which it is bound, which if they be unlocked, it is
divided into parts with conservation of those parts which constituted
this
Elementary Mixture; which parts so divided, are purified and delivered
from Excrements and Impurities, with which they abound in their
Composition. </p>
  <p>But that this might be more easily done, the Ancient Philosophers
devised
this Distillation and Destruction, by help of which, the parts might be
most highly purified and exalted to such a degree of Purity, that there
upon a Compound might be made, of greater Efficacy. But to bring this
to
pass, the Artist ought to follow Nature, as all Philosophers, both
Ancient
and Modern teach, and to extract our Mineral out of the Bosom of
Nature,
where she hath hidden it, and purify it most subtily, by very frequent
Cohabitations and Reductions. For so it thoroughly sheds all its
Excrements,
and whatsoever else hinders it from its perfect Power of Transmutation,
which is powerful, and yet it is more wonderful, that in this vile and
abject Minera, lies hidden the celebrated Stone of the Philosophers,
whose
Essence also by reason of its obscurity no body can see, unless it be
delivered
therefrom, and brought to light; for before it is set at liberty by the
Chymic Art, it is a rude, vile, abject, and undigested Mass, which is
also
found scattered in the Earth, out of a hundred pounds whereof, scarce
one
or two pounds can be extracted, which is the pure Soul, Fire, Oil, and
powerful Tincture; so also but one pound of our glorious substance;
which,
after many Martyrdoms, we extract out of our Minera, and after every
Extraction
dissolve, coagulate and fix; till passing through almost all other
colours,
it appears white, subtle, dry and penetrant, which abovementioned
colours
do sufficiently evidence the Essence of this minera, whereof the chief
colour is green as a most certain indication of life. These two
Substances,
that is to say, the Mercury and glorious Earth, are sufficient to
perfect
the Stone, having first, as we have said, accomplished their
purifications;
because our Sol and Luna before that, were involved in obscurity. </p>
  <p>The Excrements of the fixt Body are Earth and Fire, burning,
viscous,
insoluble by our Mercury, and therefore they are easily separated in
our
Water, and those things which have the Nature of the Body, which puddle
the water and confuse it, and which by a quiet rest of the Vessel, fall
to the bottom, and there unite, and are separated from the limpid
water,
which retains this precious Body in its Bosom, which at length, by
reduction,
appears again, and by Assation, is more and more attenuated; is more
and
more cleansed from its Earthy and Viscous Excrements, which as before,
are separated by our Water, till at last there remains a spongy, fixed,
most pure Body. But this Water is a thing and viscid Water, abounding
also
with Excrements, which do naturally adhere to it; for these are a fiery
and Sulphureous Earth, able indeed to coagulate this our Water in a
long
time, but yet of no moment, which nevertheless many have unluckily
magnified,
the Philosophers exclaiming, In Mercury there is whatsoever the
Philosophers
seek; which is not to be understood of this Water, but of our glorious
Mercury, which not withstanding is extracted out of this Water, which
contains
Fire dissolved in it, for which reason it has Power of Coagulating
itself,
which is a long Work; therefore to quicken the Work we dissolve some
parts
of the glorious Earth in our Mercury, that the Secret may be completed
in a shorter time. But this thin and viscous Substance which we also
call
our Mercury, doth also abound with many Aereal and Watery Excrements,
which
savour of the nature of Fountain Water; but there are others, which are
of a greasy, oily, and fat nature, and are the corroding and caustic
Fires
of a sulphureous nature, which must be separated first, by a gentle
digestion,
in a Vessel exactly well stopped, that thereby they may easily be see;
for that would be hurtful to the Water, and bring damage to the Work;
but
if this mercury be rightly prepared, it is fit to perfect the Mystery
which
ought to be accomplished, and to perform many other Operations; but
chiefly
to perfect the Sublimation, which cannot be done without pure
Materials.
For the Body admits not unclean Waters, and Water agrees not with an
unclean
Body; therefore both ought to be clean, that they may be perfectly
united
and at last Sublimed to the top of the Vessel, and there constitute the
Sulphur of Nature so much desired. This operation, Morien sowed in
these
words, If you do not perfectly cleanse the unclean Body, and do not dry
it, nor whiten it well, and do not mix its Soul with it, and do not
take
from it all its ill scent, till after its cleansing, the Tincture comes
into it, thou hast discovered nothing at all of this Mystery. </p>
  <p>Therefore we must apply ourselves with our utmost endeavors to
this
Purification and Mixtion, that both may be united and joined pure
together
with an inseparable bond; and a durable Matrimony, which even the Fire
may not be able to Separate. </p>

  </center>
  <p>We have said many things of Putrefaction, Solution and
Distillation
and that we may proceed farther to things necessary to this Work, we
will
speak something of Philosophical Calcination, which among the
Philosophers
hath been of great account. For it purifies those things which before
were
involved in the darkness of Excrements, and it brings to light clean
things,
which before were stained, and affords to us oily Sulphurs profitable
only
to our Work; but not as the Vulgar Sophists do, who attempt to Calcine
by violent Fires, Aqua Fortis, Cementation, who yields dry and Calxes
not
flowing like wax. This is not our Calcination, but rather the loss of
our
Body; because they do not increase but diminish the innate Fire of Our
Gold, which alone we want for perfecting the Tinctures. They who
calcine
thus, are blind, and walk in darkness, for our Calcination is not a dry
dessicating of our Body, by which the Body is made dry and not flowing.
This is not our Calcination, but after we have drawn out all the
Stinking
Menstrous Spirits from the Mineral Body, and abstract and cohobate till
at last we obtain a Body pure, fixed, fiery, and fluid as wax; out of
which
(being resolved in our Mercury, and so often cohobated upon it till it
be turned into a red and viscous Oil) is prepared the permanent Water,
and the glorious shining Earth, the only Pillar of our Tincture. Thus
our
Calcination is the augmentation of the innate fire, and the highest
Purification
of the body; which is done by our Pontic Water full of fire, which
burns
and mortifies the body, after Death brings it to an Immortal Life. </p>
  <p>Here perhaps the rout of Vulgar Chymists will object, not
understanding
this Calcination, and for that reason will say, How can Calcination be
made with Water, seeing the fire is the only Instrument of Calcination?
To this we answer, That Philosophic Calcination is not the Calcination
of the Vulgar, which Calcineth Mixt into Ashes, dry and deprived of all
the innate fire, and fit for no work necessary to Life, as above said;
but our Calcination, Calcineth the Mixt into a viscous Humidity,
abounding
with fire, and fixed and Permanent in it; which Humidity alone Alchemy
uses to perfect her Arcana, this made with the pontic Water, full of
Living
Fire, which alone is capable of perfecting this Calcination, which
defending
Bodies from the most violent flames of the fire, and mixes itself with
their internal Fire, and fortifies it, which hidden Calcination is
known
to few, and the True Knowledge of it is a great Secret in this Art.
Which
that the Sincere Searcher may more easily understand, let him take the
hard Vegetable Body, in the bottom; and take it fresh and most subtly
powdered,
and put it in a Vessel well secured, and put that into a Furnace with
an
open Fire, increasing the Fire by degrees, and at last giving a most
strong
Fire, let him urge it so far, that the Vessel comes plainly to a
candent
heat, so all the Water and stinking Vapours left by the Menstrual
Spirit,
will pass out, and the Body will be freed fro the; but the Fire must
not
be increased to that degree to make the matter vitrify by the Flux, for
thus it would lose its vegetable Virtue, and the operator would lose
his
oil, and Labour, and the Body would lose its thirst and hunger of
Drinking
up its proper Soul. Therefore it must be calcined with very great
Caution,
and so that it may retain this Thirst; and thus the Calcination will be
rightly performed; which is a very tedious and long work, in performing
of which the Artist ought to be very cautious. Now, after the earth is
so prepared, take it and work it by help of our Calcination till it be
wholly freed from all its Earthly and burning Feces by Reduction,
Solution,
Calcination, and Imbibition, till by Calcination it becomes wholly red,
and the Calcinatory Water be also freed from all its phlegm and Watery
Humour. Take the Earth now fluid, porous and plainly fiery, and grind
it
into Powder in a hot glass Mortar, grinding it over a Fire of Ashes for
two or three hours, until it be a subtle Powder; then add to it drop
after
drop of the Aqua Vitae, grinding it continually with a glass Pestle
till
the coagulating fume of the Earth be pretty well satiated. Then put in
a glass Vessel, digesting, and imbibing with Aqua Vitae, and grinding
till
it be converted into a bloody, glorious and mercurial Liquor, which
Liquor
is Aqua Vitae regenerated by the Fume of our earth, the Celestial
Water,
Ethereal liquor; and this is a Short and Secret Way which few also have
known. The other way is longer, and is thus: Take the Earth rubified by
virtue of the Fire of our Aqua Vitae, and grind it subtly, and digest
it
with its water, till it be converted into a black sparkling Mass, which
is the Antimony or Black Lead so much spoken of by the Philosophers,
which
is made in three months, then Wheeling it about, and circulating it
well,
work it till it becomes a Tincture Citrine and red. This way is long,
and
lasts almost two years, and is very tedious, which also the Ancient
Philosophers
taught, saying: Azoth and Fire are sufficient; Fire and Water wash
Laton,
Purify, and Fix and Incere it. And, Wash Laton and Tear your Books,
lest
your Hearts be broken. Which way also a certain Philosopher teaches
darkly,
saying: Take that which is most Volatile, and conjoin and wash the more
fixed with the volatile, till the most fixed receives the most
volatile;
then turn the Earth into Water, the Water into Fire, the Fire into Air,
and enclose the Fire the middle of the Water, and the Earth in the
Belly
of the Air; Mix the hot with the moist, and the dry with the cold,
because
one Nature overcomes another, and Nature rejoices in Nature, but the
Earth
contains them all. For when the four Natures have ascended up to
Heaven,
again at length descended, so that the Fire may descend into Air, Air
into
Water, Water into Earth; but the end of the whole Work is Powder and
Ashes. </p>
  <p>These and the like words the Philosophers use to describe their
Secrets,
by which they delude the ignorant, and cast a mist before the Eyes of
the
Vulgar Chymists but as I said before, let all lay aside their Opinion
of
Our Calcination, who believe it is done by the vulgar way; these
persons
are daily deceived, and deceive many with themselves; let them learn
first,
before they attempt Our Calcination, which is of so great moment, and
so
wonderful, that in it Fire alone and Azoth are sufficient, and know, if
they desire to know, that every Spirit is fixed by a Calx of its own
kind;
which if it be fixed with the Body, it Calcines it, and if the Artists
so Calcine, they will find it profitable, but I not, Sorrow and Sadness
will overwhelm them, because being Ignorant, they dare attempt Our
Calcination. </p>

  <p>Because the Vegetable Body which we also call Mercury, is of a
vile
Nature; namely, Earthy and Watery; therefore it ought to be exalted to
a more noble and subtle Nature, namely Airy and Fiery, which two are
very
near Principles of this Mercury, as well according to the intention of
Nature as of Art, and therefore the vegetable Body must enter again
into
the Belly of its Mother, thus by Death and Regeneration it may attain
to
such Dignity; but which cannot be done but by Philosophic Corruption
and
Alteration, which causes our Menstrous, Fiery and Airy Vapours and
Fumes
(which before came out by Distillation from the Body) to thicken by a
gentle
Digestion and Rotation, that this Water being circulated, may the
better
penetrate the Pores of our Body, and so successively alter the inward
part
of the Body, and at length truly and rightly regenerate it. This
Putrefaction
or Alteration of this Body, consists in Solution of the Same Body in
its
own Airy and Fiery Vapour, which can best by Digestion alter the Body,
and bring it to a new Generation. And it is altered whilst it is
dissolved
in that Water, because this Water is the true Sepulcher of the Body, in
which it dies and is putrefied. For this Water, and no other, can
alter,
purify, dissolve, distil, calcine, and mortify the Body, until at
length
it is reduced to a most subtle, not terrestrial, but Viscous Alcohol,
which
is done not only by dissolving this vegetable Body in its own Water,
but
by many other labours and operations; namely, by dissolving it into
Water,
and then again Drying, Calcining and Inhumating it, and this again
drying
and calcining and afterwards distilling, till at length the Body as it
were Invisibly by so many, and such operations, it is truly altered;
the
sign of which is a dark blackness, which is the true mortification of
this
Vegetable Body, in its Mother or Menstrous and Vaporous Water; which is
done in the beginning of the work, and in the crude Conjunction of a
pure
Agent and Patient; which is a hard Herculean and hazardous Work, the
knowledge
of which dissolves all other Arcana of the following Operations; but
especially
of the second Alteration, which is done with our Sublimed and glorious
Sulphur; by Inhumation and Imbibition, in a philosophical Vessel, with
our permanent Mercury, of which we will not now speak; but of the
first,
which is very laborious, and requires an Ingenious Artist; of which
also
the Ancient Philosophers made no mention at all; which whosoever
understands,
very easily attains all the rest, in which no Man can err, if after
Distillation
and Inhumation, he prepares the Earth to Citrinity and Viscosity; of
which
Body so prepared and calcined to a Citrinity, take one or two pounds,
and
Powder it subtly in a strong Mortar, and imbibe in the same mortar
from&nbsp;
hour to hour, grinding it subtly, and imbibing with our Living Water,
till
the Matter be converted into a fat and slimy Mass; whence you must
circulate
till it be thin, and circulate again till it be thick, sometimes
imbibing
and distilling. So by reiterated Work, this Earth will become a thin
and
viscid Mass. Take this and put into a glass cucurbit, which put in
Balneo,
and there circulate it till it be turned into blackish ashes, which you
keep carefully and dry them in a gentle Fire, in a glass vessel. Then
take
these Ashes powdered, and put them into a glass Vessel very well luted,
and distill at first with a gentle Fire; then somewhat stronger, and so
will ascend our Mercury white, viscous and limpid, which we call the
Lunary
Virgin Milk; now increase the Fire, and there will ascend a gummy
Liquor,
red as blood, and transparent, which is the blood of Sol and our Earth,
which is extracted from part of the Body and Soul of our Stone. This is
that Liquor permanent and Triumphing over all Metals and Stone, the
blood
of the Green Lion, the Secret Fire, which must be extracted from its
crudity,
and exalted with the glorious Earth; to exalt which, take it pure, and
pour it upon the remainder (which is Lead already calcined from redness
to black) and digest it upon this Lead, till it hath extracted its
Salt,
and be satiated with that Salt; then it must be exalted, which is our
triumphing,
exalted and glorious Mercury, of an Hermaphroditical nature, which is
that
Water which putrefies, purifies, coagulates, fixes, distills, calcines
and inceres itself; which is so Secret among the Philosophers, without
which no Tincture can be made which an Artist can use to make Aurum
Potabile.
Put into it Vulgar Gold, having passed the Royal Cement, and being then
most subtly foliated, circulating the Gold and distilling, till it be
converted
into a thick Oil, splendid as a Ruby, the use of which renews youth,
and
restores debilitated strength. But for Elixir, take it and circulate it
upon Sal Armoniac sublimed and fixed into a citrine colour (N.B.: not
Vulgar
Sal Armoniac) and circulate till it be fixed, then ferment and
multiply,
until this Mercury together with its Earth, flow and remain fixed in
the
Fire, Tingeing every Metal into True Gold. </p>
  <p>This now what I was willing to say concerning Alteration, which
alone
contains the hidden Secrets of Philosophy. Fr our Stone must often die
and be revived and regenerated, and at last attain to the highest
glory;
which we have at present so clearly laid open, that he must be of a
dull
wit who does not perfectly understand it. I have written clearly, and
will
yet write more clearly; but it will make many admire apprehending that
I break the Seal of Hermes. But let those know, that I have written
clearly
to the Sons of Art, to whom I would lay open more, if it were Lawful to
do it publicly, but to the Myso-philosophists and Sophists, these will
be mere Enigmas, in which is more, they will not believe there are so
great
Secrets hidden in Nature. </p>

  </center>
  <p>For the Exaltation of our Body (which we also call Gold) that of
it
may be made a new Heaven and a new Earth, it is necessary that the Body
being already made pure, be again joined with a pure Soul, that so
being
perfectly united, may be exalted and glorified; which glorification,
that
it may be rightly performed, it is requisite that the Body be made pure
by Death and Separation, and that the Soul be likewise purified, to do
which, the Artist must in certain quantity (but cautiously) pour the
Soul
upon the Body, so that the Soul being so joined with the Body, may
carry
it to Heaven; and so both are perfectly divested of all Excrements, and
acquire a very high penetrating Virtue. Both must be freed from
Excrements,
because this Soul (as is sufficiently shown already) needs many
purification,
by Subliming it, that it may be freed from all its Original
Uncleanness,
before they be united, so as they may become one thing by
Glorification.
For if they are conjoined while they are impure, they will never be
united,
because of the Original uncleanness with which they abound, would
hinder
Union; and their Conjunction being hindered, they could never unite,
for
in that Union consists the Glorification, but both, that is to say the
Body and the Soul, are separated from their Original Uncleanness before
they are conjoined, not by one and the same method, but by divers; that
is to say, the Body by Sublimation often reiterated; but it must be
observed,
that the Soul must by little and little be poured upon the Body, and be
cherished by natural heat, till the same hath imbibed all the Body, and
the Soul which is contained within the pores of the Blood, receives a
Sanguine
Body, which it doth receive when the Blood, in which it is contained,
has
imbibed the Body, and so the Soul and Body are united by immediate
Contact,
and being of the same Nature, one as easy ingress into the other, and
then
the natural heat cherishes them so, that they are more and more united,
and by union become one Body different from the former, in which the
Soul
and Body are exalted together. And it is to be noted, that the Body
before
was gross and soul, and the Soul in like manner impure; both which are
now purified and united, which if they be united, by help of the Blood
in which the Soul is contained, are exalted into a fiery Body, much
different
from the former, which is the Son of the Fire, a glorious Sulphur, not
unlike to shining Talc, out of which is immediately made the Physical
Stone.
Now let the Searcher of this Science consider, how great a Work the
glorification
of the body with its Soul is; and let not any one accuse me of
obscurity;
I say, when this Soul, known to all, with the Blood of the Body, are
truly
and really conjoined, then you must take this Matter, and put it in to
a glass vessel well luted, and a glass Alembic very well closed, and
digest
it, than give a strong fire, and so our Sulphur will ascend to the
sides
of the vessel, and will leave a black powder in the bottom, very
volatile
and of no value, which is the damned Earth deprived of all that is good
for any thing. But if this Powder be heavy, it is an evident sign, that
still there remains something good in it, which could not be dissolved,
and then this Body must again be imbibed with the Soul and the Blood
and
again be sublimed, till it ascends white as Snow, and shining, which is
our fiery, foliated Sulphur, which alone we need, to make any Tincture;
to which, for abbreviating the work, we add pure Luna dissolved in the
permanent Water; then we decoct, fix, incere and ferment in a close
Vessel,
till it be completely fixed, pure, flowing and Tingeing. </p>
  <p>Take the dead and living Body, and put it in a glass Vessel, and
our
upon I its Soul till the Body be all imbibed by it, then distill and
sublime;
reiterate this Work often with fresh Water or Soul, till the matter
sublimes
itself clear as a Star, which you must take and put into an Egg with a
long neck in hot Sand; digest it for a week, the next week increase the
Fire, at last increase it more, and so it is fixed; Take this Sublimed
and fixed mercury, and dissolve it in the fire against Nature; cohobate
till both become one Water, in which dissolve Luna, and decoct, imbibe
and fix till they flow, because it Tinges Venus into Luna. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter IX</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Because I have declared to all Lovers of this Science, the
beginning
and end of perfecting our mercury, which is the chief and longest part
of our Elixir, which being had, all the rest may be easily performed;
therefore
I will speak of its perfection and Operation into an Elixir; whose
first
operation to accomplish this end, is thus. Take our Earth very highly
purified,
which is Our Gold, hollow and spongy, and put it onto a glass Vessel,
and
there irrigate it by little and little, with its own subtle Humidity,
which
easily enters this spongy Body so that by means of Circulation, the
Airy
and Fiery part of this Subtle Humidity may incorporate, and be
coagulated,
and be united together with the Earth. Then irrigate again the subtle
Humidity,
and circulate for eight days in a Vessel very well closed (and here
above
all things, beware that you do not irrigate this Earth but by little
and
little, from eight days to eight days, in a very long trituration, so
that
the force of this Water may not suffocate the Virtue of the Earth;
because
the Virtue of the Earth is weak in the beginning of the Imbibition,
which
if it should be suffocated with abundance of water, it would become an
unprofitable mass, void of all Action. </p>
  <p>But the phlegm f our subtle Humidity may be drawn out by Alembic
during
the Circulation. So by reiterate Irrigations and Circulations this
Earth
will become a pure Fire and Aether, and the Artist will then obtain his
desire, when the Earth is rubified by the Spirit and Soul, which be
Irrigation
and Circulation, have united themselves together with the earth; which
if it be distilled, he will have the Blood of the Green Lion, the
Saturnal
Water, which is the first Operation of the mercury, in which the
Spiritual
Substance is transmuted from nature to Nature by means of the Body, so
often, till together with the Body, they constitute the Permanent
Water. </p>
  <p>The Second and last Operation, is that of the Fixation of the
permanent
Water and the glorious Earth, of which the Philosophers say: That it is
a commixtion of qualities, a Copulation of Complexions, a Reconjunction
of things separated, a Coagulation of Principles, a Sisposition of what
is repugnant; which must be done by a gentle Fire, Cherishing the parts
mixt together, and put into a glass Vessel, being first made very pure.
  </p>
  <p>And in the luternal Fire of these parts being excited by a gentle
External,
doth dissolve and decoct them, and by decoction they are again by
little
and little inspissated and made thicker, until a t length they are
wholly
fixed, and remain fixed in the bottom of the Circulatory. </p>
  <p>For the Earth contains in itself a Fiery, most thin, dry and
insensible
Fume, which coagulates the Volatile part, being of its own Nature and
Substance.
This Fume lying hid in he Center of the Earth, by its Action converts
the
other volatile Elements into its own (namely a fixed) Nature; and then
the Motion of these Elements cease because they have attained this
desired
end; which if they be again dissolved by the volatiles, their motion
begins
again, till the fixed have overcome the volatile. Then again motion
ceases,
which if they are dissolved again, they work afresh, and etc. </p>
  <p>Here all operators must observe, that in this operation a Two-fold
Fire
must be used, the one Internal, the other External, which External must
not overpower the Internal; the Internal is a dry Mercurial Ethereal
Nectar,
and our glorious mercury, which vivifies, conserves, and nourishes the
matter, and brings it to perfection; This Fire is not moved but by our
External Agent, which if it be slow in operation, the Internal Fire
lies
still, and produces nothing; but if the External be too strong, either
the Vessels break, or the Matter burns; therefore the Fore must be
warily
applied, so that the Fumes, which lie hid in the Center of our Earth,
may
be moved, and then the Spiritual Humidity will resolve the Earthy
Siccity,
and the Earth will be impregnated by the volatile, and will grow thick;
the Sign whereof is blackness. And if the Spirits of this compound be
more
inspissated, various colours will appear, and by a farther operation,
there
will appear a white colour, afterwards a citrine, and lastly, a red
diaphanous
colour; and after reiterate Operation, the matter will be of easy
fusion,
fixed, and Tingeing all imperfect Metals into pure Gold, which that the
Artist may attain. </p>
  <p>Take our glorious shining Earth, and fix it Philosophically, as
above
we have declared, and put it in a fit glass Vessel, let it be dissolved
there in our Water against Nature which also is called Lunaria, the
Blood
of the Red Lyon, distilled Spirit of Wine, Saturnal Water, our glorious
Mercury; digest the solution for three weeks, then open the Vessel, and
join to it an Alembic, and distill by Fire of Balneum, all insipid
phlegm
that can be distilled, and when it ceases, take away the Alembic, and
shut
the Vessel; put it again to circulate, then all the Humidity, by little
and little will be fixed, and will grown thick like mud of a blackish
colour;
circulate it farther till perfect blackness appear, and by farther
operation
whiteness, and lastly the highest shining redness; which is the fiery
Ruby,
tingeing and healing the Leprous Bodies of Metals; he multiplication
whereof
an Ingenious Operator can easily effect. Namely, if he dissolve the
Stone
of the first Order, completely finished, in our glorious Mercury
decocts,
fixes, and inceres; and so he may multiply it, and very highly exalt
it;
which that they may accomplish, I wish to all, by our Lord Jesus
Christ. </p>
  <p><i>Amen.</i> </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter I</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>I have, in the preceding Book, sufficiently taught, not only the
Theory,
but also the Practice, sufficient for the understanding the operation
of
this Divine Science. But for the more clear understanding it, by divers
Praxes as well in general as in Particular; I have written this Second
Book for the benefit of the Faithful and Worthy, as also of those who
have
attained to some Knowledge of our Mysteries, that they may more easily
obtain their desire. </p>
  <p>And against petty tricking Chymists, who endeavor to make the
Tincture
of the Philosophers, in one Vessel, for very little charges, in one
Furnace
in a short time, and shamelessly, and with a brazen Face, fraudulently
profess this Art, which they are not in the least worthy to know. And
here
I would advise the True and Faithful Searchers of this Art, that they
understand
that there is but one thing in Nature of which all things are made,
which
can be desired in Philosophy; which though sometimes I have called and
shall call Calx Vive, sometimes Tartar, sometimes Venus and other
Names,
yet I say, that only one thing is to be understood, as with me bears
witness,
the Ancient Philosopher Hermes, saying, As all Things were from one by
the mediation of one; so all things proceeded from this one by
Adaptation. </p>
  <p><b>The First Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>The masculine Earth of Sol, of itself, can bear no Fruit, as the
male
without the Female cannot have any offspring, therefore necessarily the
male needs the Female; Our Solar Earth needs the Water, which is its
Female.
Take therefore, in the Name of the Creator of heaven and Earth, this
Solar
Golden and Ruddy, and add to it the water of Dew, which is its Wife and
Mother; for this Earth is generated by the Dew, and put it into a round
glass Vessel, so the Earth will resolve itself in the Dew-Water, and
the
Water will be impregnated with the Golden Seed of the male. Then give a
gentle Fire of Circulation, so the superfluous and stinking sweat will
vanish out of the Vessel, which being gone, if the Female begin to fly
and follow the Sweat, close the glass firmly and continue the Fire, so
the matter, and by long Operations and Continuation of the External
Fire,
the water will extract the Seed of the Earth and grow thick, and wholly
by the farther continuation together with the Earth, will thicken into
a blood red Liquor, which is the first Fruit of the Philosophic Tree.
Take
this and circulate, evaporating its superfluity, adding more water and
circulating, until the Earth with the Water be turned into Air and
Fire.
Then distill, first the Air, which reserve firmly closed up in a glass
vessel. This Air is the White Air, a vivifying and unctuous Air, the
life
Metals. Secondly, distill the Fire, which is Red Vital Fire, a Fire
vivifying
the Souls of metals, keep also this Fire apart. Now rectify first the
White
Air till it be bright and serene as Crystal; in like manner rectify the
Fire till it be like a pure Ruby; Then take the Earth and separate from
it the Water, which rectify and join it partly with the Fire, and
partly
with the Air. Rectify the Earth by drying it gently till it be white.
Then
add to the Earth, first, the Fire conjoined with the Water, and
circulate
the Fire upon the Earth, till the Earth appears plainly dry. Add again
the Fire with the Water, and circulate as before till it again be
plainly
dry; and if all the Fire be coagulated by the Thirsty Earth, the Earth
will be turned into Fire. Now add the Air with the Water, and circulate
till the fiery Earth hath swallowed up the Air; add again Air, and
circulate
till it be again dry. Then add all the remaining part of the Air, and
circulate
for some days, and take out your water, fiery and Airy Earth, and put
in
another Vessel, and give gentle Fire and a certain watery humour will
arise.
Then put an Alembic upon your Vessel, and distill, increasing the Fire,
and so there will pass over, first, an airy, fiery and earthy Water
Splendent
as Luna. </p>
  <p>Then cease, and put to it another Alembic, and distill an airy,
fiery
and watery Earth, which two being had, if the Artist be adapted, he
hath
enough for doing farther things, if he proceed after the following
manner.
Take the airy, fiery and watery Earth and pulverize, grinding it subtly
in a glass mortar, and put it into a glass Vessel, imbibing this Earth
with the airy, fiery and earthy Water, grinding this mass strongly upon
a gentle Fire, till it be like a thin Paste. </p>
  <p>Now distill and circulate it till it be thin, and liquorous; then
distill,
and pour this distilled Water again upon what remains, and distil and
cohobate
until the water with the Earth becomes a fixed Oil, which must be
circulated
upon Gold after this manner. Take Gold calcined most subtly with
Sulphur
Vive, into a purple red Calx, which put into a glass, and pour upon it
of this thin Oil, and circulate in a close vessel till the Oil become
red.
Take this and fix it upon the remaining Earth of Gold, after a
Philosophical
manner, till both are fixed into Powder, which resolves with the
aforesaid
Oil, and convert it by circulation into a fixed Oil, whereof one part
Tines
much Copper into Gold. This manner is very difficult and long, by
reason
of the many Purifications and long Circulations and Distillations and
Conversions
of the Elements, but the following manner is shorter, which is done
with
Calx Vive. </p>
  <p><b>The Second Praxis with Calx Vive ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Calx Vive, calcined to a redness by a strong Fire in a dry
Reverberatory;
put it into a Vessel, with a strong cover, adding Spirit of Wine, and
imbibing
with the said Spirit till it will drink no more, then distil the Phlegm
from the Spirit of Wine, which being passed over, increase the Fire,
and
join another Receiver, and distill the Spirit of Wine from the Calx
Vive;
and when the Calx Vive is plainly dried, then take it and dry it more
in
a glass vessel with a good strong Fire, and being again cooled, add
Spirit
of Wine, separate it by filter, because it is a combustible Sulphur.
And
so cohobate the Spirit of Wine upon the Calx Vive, always separating
the
Phlegm, till it be thick, oily and fat, then cease, and take the
remaining
Calx Vive, and calcine it in a Reverberatory with a strong Fire, until
it be plainly white; put it so white into a strong glass, and imbibe it
with the thick water, reiterating till the water be coagulated by the
Fire
of the Calx Vive; then digest this mass four days, and distill first a
Water which is Aqua Vitae, from Red Wine, Spirit of Wine, rectified,
etc.
And when that is distilled, increase the Fire, and change the Receiver,
and so there will ascend a Volatile Salt, which Salt is the Terrestrial
Fire of the Calx Vive, purified, coagulated, and made Volatile by the
Spirit
of Wine in form of a bright Salt, which the operator must take, and
assating,
calcine and imbibe it with the Aqua Vitae of the Red Wine, and then
dissolve
that Mass, and distill till both become one Water, shining as Crystal;
which is the fiery Mercury of Calx Vive, resolving all metals. </p>
  <p>This Praxis of Calx Vive is shorter than the former, but in
working
it, the Artist ought to be Ingenious, especially in Calcining the Calx
Vive, and imbibing it, which mus be done warily. And to this Praxis the
Vitriolization of Tartar is not Inferior, which is not only useful in
all
Tartarous Diseases, and in resolving their Obstructions, but also in
increasing
the Animas of Metals. </p>
  <p><b>The Third Praxis, of Vitriolate Tartar ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Salt of Tartar very well calcined, and well purified by
Resolutions
and Calcinations till it be Porous; dissolve it by Imbibitions with
Spirit
of Vitriol, then dry and imbibe, and again dry so often, till one part
of the Tartar coagulates two parts of the Spirit of Vitriol. </p>
  <p>Then take it, and powder it, and spread it upon a glass plate, and
set
it in a moist place to resolve into an oily Liquor, which evaporate in
a glass Curcurbit in Balneo till it be like Honey. To this add more of
the Spirit of Vitriol, and dissolve this Honey-like Mass, and when it
is
dissolved, distil off the Spirit of Vitriol, which pour again upon what
remains, cohobate so often till the Tartar, together with the Spirit of
Vitriol, become one Water; which take (for it is the fiery Water of
Tartar
and Vitriol) and distil gently in Balneo, first the burning Spirit of
Vitriol;
then increase the Fire, and change the Receiver, and distil the Oil of
Tartar, which must be rectified, as also the burning Spirit of Vitriol;
which Two, are our Mercuries sufficiently fitted for the Composition of
the Elixir of the first Order. There is yet another manner very Subtle,
which is done by Extraction and Sublimation, but it is very Secret,
which
I will also Communicate to the Worthy, and it is done out of the
Vitriol
of Venus. </p>
  <p><b>The Fourth Praxis of the Vitriol of Venus ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Vitriol of Venus which is made of Verdegrise and distilled
Vinegar,
by Extraction, as is known; Powder it, and put it into a glass Retort
very
well luted, put it into a Furnace with Sand-Fire, and put to it a
Receiver
, and begin to distil first with a gentle Fire till the Phlegm be come
over; then increase the Fore, and when the white fumes begin to distil,
change the Receiver and join a new one, which must be well luted; and
when
the white Spirit is distilled, increase the Fire; and as quick as can
be,
change the Receiver, and distil the Red Oil, which is the Oil of
Verdegris;
increase the fire till the Retort be of a white heat, and when no more
will distill, take off the Receiver, and break the Retort, being first
cooled, and take out the Caput Mortuum, which is obscurely red, and
ponderous,
by reason of the Venus which it contains; powder it, and pour upon it
its
dephlegmated Oil, and also its white Spirit; and when you have poured
on
all the Spirit, close the Vessel and circulate these Liquors upon the
Earth
till they are perfectly united; then distill, and first will come over
a white and gummy Liquor, which is the exuberate water, then increase
the
fire and there will ascend the Sulphur of Venus, subtle and penetrating
all Metals after its Calcination. Take this and powder it, and put it t
the exuberate water, circulating and dissolving till both are turned
into
a glutinous Liquor shining like Talc; which circulate till nothing will
ascend and descend, then distill, and there will distill a serene
Liquor,
which is our triumphant and exuberate Mercury; and when it ceases to
distill,
increase the Fire, and a white Sulphur will distill, which is the
glorious
Sulphur extracted from the Earth of our Venus, and the Feces which
remain
are the Terra Damnata. The following manner is of the Slat of Saturn,
useful
and very profitable upon Metals, by reason of the grain of Gold which
it
contains. </p>
  <p><b>The Fifth Praxis of the Salt of Saturn ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take of the Salt of Saturn very well purified, and mix it with two
parts
of Vitriol Calcined. Put this mixture into a Curcurbit well luted, and
join to it an Alembic, luting it strongly, and distil into a good large
Receiver first with a gentle Fire, and the Water which distills, is
called
the Water and Oil of Nature distilled from the hearth of Saturn, which
rectify well till it is bright, break the Cucurbit, and if the Caput
Mortuum
is red, it is good, if not Calcine it in a Crucible with a gentle fire
till it be red. Take this and separate all heterogeneous things from
it,
as well as may be, after the Vulgar manner, till it be pure; which take
and put into a large glass Vessel, and pour upon it its distilled Oil
in
great quantity, and put the Vessel in a warm place for four or five
hours,
and then filter what is dissolved of the Caput Mortuum, and upon what
remains,
pour new Oil and filter what is dissolved; pour all the Solutions
together,
and distill all the Oil by Retort, so a certain white and subtle Salt
will
remain in the bottom. Take this and dissolve it in new Oil, and
cohobate
this Oil upon the Salt of Saturn, till after the Oil the volatile Salt
of Saturn rises; which purify by four sublimations, every time changing
the Vessel; and taking out that which is pure; and rectify the Oil by
Seven
Distillations. Then conjoin the Salt with the Oil, and digest this Mass
for four weeks in a vaporous Bath, then distill in a retort well luted,
cohobating so often until they are inseparably united. Which Oil is our
mercury, which being decocted with the Anima of Gold, gives great
Tincture
upon Lead. But the following manner gives not place to This. </p>
  <p><b>The Sixth Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Urine putrefied, and inspissate it, out of which so
inspissated,
make a Salt which is an Animal Salt. Distill this in a very strong
Retort,
and what distills rectify seven tomes, till it be pure and very bright,
which keep. </p>
  <p>Take what remains in the Retort and calcine it, and extract out of
it
a Salt with common Water, which Salt must be rectified by Calcinations
till it is white and flows. Take this and Powder it very subtly, and
dissolve
it in the water reserved as above, and when it is dissolved, abstract
all
its Superfluities, seal the Vessel and work the matter by Circulation
of
the Elements of this urine until the matter appear dry by Means of
Circulation,
which dissolve again in the abovesaid Water, and circulate the Solution
by Distillation till all be converted in the bottom of the Vessel into
a very thick and fat Oil, which dry and distil, and there will distill
a two-fold water. One white, the other yellow, each of which rectify
seven
times by itself. Now take the Oil remaining in the Retort from the
Distillations
of the white and yellow Water, and sublime it in a clean Vessel,
increasing
the Fire by degrees, and take what is sublimed, and put to it the
abovesaid
yellow rectified water, and circulate the water with the sublimate till
they are united; in which dissolve Gold, and cohobate the water upon
the
Gold till the Gold be turned into an Oil, which is augmented by the
yellow
water, conjoined with the sublimate, in Infinitum. And it is to be
noted
that after every cohobation of the water upon the Gold, the Phlegm must
be separated; this way is very available to Metals. </p>
  <p><b>The Seventh Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take our Vegetable Body, which is our Gold extracted from the
Minera
of Saturn, Powder it very subtly in a very clean glass, and if it be
one
pound, put to it o our water (which is the Aqua Vitae distilled from
Wine)
two pounds; mix it very well with a glass Pestle, grinding it for two
or
three hours continually, and when the Mass is so mixed, put it in a
good
strong glass, and digest it for a fortnight: Then open the Vessel, and
evaporate the superfluous Water, which is the phlegm if that wonderful
Wine from which the phlegm of that wonderful Wine from which the phlegm
distills first, and when the mass is dry, powder it and again dissolve
it in this Water, and again digest, and again evaporate, and when the
Mass
is dry, yet once more do with it as before, thus put it into a
Cucurbit,
and give a Fire of Sublimation and what is sublimed put together, and
what
remains, work over again with our wonderful Wine, and sublime, and what
is sublimed, put with the former, and so often work the remainder with
our wine, till there remain in the bottom a subtle Powder of no value,
for it is the Terra Damnata, and the Desert laid waste, which cast
away;
but take that which is sublimed, and sublime it seven times by itself;
then Powder it most Subtly, and put it into a glass, and put upon it so
much of our glorious Mercury that it may become a paste, which so work
that out of it by Circulation, may be made a fixed Oil. This Tinges all
impure Metals into Gold or Silver, according as it is fermented. Our
glorious
Mercury is commodiously prepared after the following manner. </p>
  <p><b>The Praxis of the Glorious Mercury ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take our corporeal mercury, which is Animal, Vegetable and
Mineral,
the reason whereof for the present I will not speak of. </p>
  <p>Powder this most subtly, and pour upon it the Water of the Rock in
equal
weight&nbsp; (for this stony Spirit is white, and contains the Soul of
the Elements, and therefore it is called the Blood of nature, Secret,
extracted
from its own Body, Animal and Vegetable) and digest it in Balneo;
Circulating
this Water upon the Mercury till it will work no more; then separate
the
Water from the Earth, and add new, till all which is Homogeneal be
extracted
out of the Body. Then take this water exuberated with the Fire of the
Corporeal
mercury, and circulate it into a black Earth by continual operation,
and
when the Water is so converted into Earth, after it had passed through
all the other Elements, take it and sublime it in a close Vessel upon a
gentle Fire, and what sublimes to the top of the Vessel, will be a
Volatile
Substance shining and ruddy. This is that thing which Tempers the
violence
of our mercury. Take this Substance very pure, and add to it its Water,
and distill the water with it, and all which distills will be bright,
ponderous,
and unctuous, and is our glorious Mercury. </p>
  <p>The following manner is very good, which is done with white Sugar,
which
is brought in great plenty from the East Indies. </p>
  <p><b>The Eighth Praxis of Sugar ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take white Sugar-Candy which grows in the East Indies in long
Canals,
and powdering it subtly, put it in a strong glass, and put to it the
Acid
Spirit of Honey, very highly rectified; and by Circulation, convert the
Sugar with the Spirit of Honey into a viscous Earth, which circulate,
adding
more Spirit of Honey, till it be thin and liquid in a pale colour. Take
this and digest it in Balneo for thirty days, which time being passed,
open the Vessel, and distill off gently all the superfluous phlegm then
change the receiver, and close the joints exceedingly well, distill a
viscid
liquor of Sugar, which pour again upon what remains, and distill the
Liquor,
cohobating so often upon what remains, till it ascends with the Liquor
and leaves the Feces behind, which keep well, and take the Liquor, and
circulate it by itself for seven or eight days in a close Vessel, then
distill gently a clear and bright Liquor, which is one of our
Mercuries;
but what remain is thick as thin Honey, to which put the Feces above
reserved,
grinding both strongly in a Mortar, and being very well mixed, put to
this
our distilled Mercury, and seal up the glass firmly, digesting till our
Mercury by digestion grows red with the Fire of its own Body, then
separate
it, and add new to what remains, proceeding as above said, till it will
no longer grow red; keep what remains, and take the Mercury, and digest
them for two days; then distill with a gentle Fire (luting exceeding
well)
a white Liquor, which being distilled, put your Vessel in Ashes,
increase
the Fire, and distil, and there will distill a thick Liquor very
yellow;
which keep, and rectify very highly in Ashes till it become clear, thin
and bright; then take the Feces and put them to those above reserved;
mix
these well in a glass Mortar, and assate them, in the beginning gently,
then strongly, till after various colours they become yellowish; which
take, and put to them drop by drop of the red rectified Mercury, and
circulate;
when they are dry, add more of the red Mercury drop by drop,
circulating
the Mercury with this Earth so often, till it remains moist by
Circulation;
then seal up the Vessel, and digest it farther. </p>
  <p>Now take Gold calcined, and pour upon it our mercury, and distill
the
mercury so often upon the Gold, till the Gold remains white, with which
Solar Oil the Medicine may be multiplied till it is most strong. </p>
  <p><b>The Ninth Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take the Minera of the red Earth, out of which separate a bloody
and
vaporous Humidity, which Circulate by itself for a long time, till from
these is made one red fume, and another white; rectify each of these by
itself, separating the superfluous and combustible Sulphur. Then take
the
Body well known, and coagulate these fumes upon it by means of a dry
Fire,
and when this mass is like ashes, take it and distill, first a Liquor,
which is Lac Lunae extracted out of the Rays of the Central Luna: and
when
it is distilled, take and rectify it till it shines like Luna in her
bright
Luster (if it be first rectified upon Sulphur Vive sublimed, which must
especially be noted here) this liquor is our vivifying Air, green and
very
powerful in Virtue to multiply Luna, which is of kin to it. Take Luna
first
subtly purified by various labours, and precipitated into a Powder by a
corrosive; of which, with this Lunar Water, make a thick and blue Oil,
by a gentle cohobation of the said Lunar Mercury, upon Luna so
prepared.
And here it is to be noted, that after every Distillation of the
mercury
upon Luna, the phlegm must be separated, which the Mercury during the
Operation,
by its own Virtue attracts. Afterward, decoct that Lunar Oil by a
gentle
heat of external Fire for 190 days, into a white shining Earth, which
must
be multiplied with the said Lunar Oil, till one part tinges five
thousand
parts of Venus into Luna. </p>
  <p>This, Friendly Reader, is what I was willing to say in general, by
divers
Praxes tending tone end, which every one may easily understand, if he
have
but the Knowledge of the Sulphur and Mercury, discovered by me in the
First
Book. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter II</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>I have sufficiently, in the foregoing Chapter, declared the Praxis
in
general, and openly enough to be understood. But now I will speak
particularly
of the Operations, and for the greater Illustration of the said very
clear
generals, that all who are Worthy and Faithful, may understand them. I
know also, that for these Praxes I shall have many ill-willers and
reproachers,
and chiefly those Philosophers, who persuade themselves that the
Tinctures
may be made with very little pain, in one vessel, one Furnace, with one
External Fire, and so deceive, with themselves, many others. But let
these
high nosed Scoffers Know, that the Philosophers&#8217; Stone is a Thing of
higher
moment than they imagine. For it is a difficult Thing, and of deep
Search
to be understood; and of great labour to be accomplished; which they
with
me would acknowledge, if they apprehended the Operations of Nature. </p>
  <p><b>The First Praxis of Mercury ~</b> </p>
  <p>Although this Praxis at the first Sight, may seem ridiculous to
many,
yet it is true if it be understood.&nbsp; Take, in the name of the
Omnipotent
God, of the best mercury, which must be pure, flowing, crystalline, and
very Serene, which you may very well know, if you put it upon Silver;
and
after Evaporation, it leaves behind it a black spot, which is a certain
sigh of Gold --- or if you put it upon a strong fire, it emits green
and
red fumes; if it has these three signs, it is good, and fit for our
work;
which you must purify by subliming it divers times, that at length by a
long time, it may become pure and neat, and free from all corrosive and
phlegmatical Excrements, which take and pour upon calcined Gold,
mingling
and grinding the Mercury with the Gold, till both are very well mixed;
put them upon a gentle Fire, evaporate the superfluous Mercury from the
Calx of Gold, till you see it appear of a red colour, then take it and
grind it subtly in a mortar, and amalgamate it with new mercury,
grinding
without Fire (which is to be noted for this kind of amalgamation is
made
without Fire) and when it is like a Paste, evaporate it again,
reiterating
this Amalgamation with new Mercury, and Evaporation of the Said
Mercury,
and soften till you see the Nature of this Mercury to be sufficiently
introduced
into this Gold, which may be easily discerned. This Gold is
Mercurialized
Gold, which take and digest in a glass firmly closed for some time;
which
being done, take it out and to reduce it proceed thus: Take the
Mercurialized
Gold, and mix it with the subtile and serene Mercury in sufficient
quantity,
and put the mixture into a good strong glass Retort, which close well;
and digest this serene Mercury, circulating it upon the Gold, till you
see no more ascend and descend; and in the bottom of the Vessel you
will
find the Gold corrupted; of a black colour; which take and amalgamate
with
New Mercury, distilling, cohobating and animating the Mercury upon the
Gold, so often till the Gold is plainly reduced into a viscid Water,
which
is its Reduction, and requires a long time; out of which reduced Gold
now
the Elements must be separated. </p>
  <p>Here let all the Ignorant Sophisters and all Chymists be mute, who
endeavor
to make all Tinctures in a short time without any labour. These Idiots
know not, that first there must be a Reduction of Gold into its first
Matter;
namely, a thick splendid and Viscid water abounding with the principles
of compounded Gold. Secondly, the Separation of this reduced Gold, and
Sublimation of the same most fixed Gold, before any profitable Tincture
can be made. Verily a Herculean Work, and most laborious! And not known
but by those who are learned and Expert; which Lully and Geber, most
subtle
Doctors of Alchemy, do sufficiently show; whose divers ways of working
described by them, are to be accounted not Sophistication, as the
Ignorant
Chymic Mob persuade themselves; but for the very truth, let all
Searchers
of the Chymic Art read the writings of the Ancient Sages, who have
created
of Alchemy, from the most Ancient Sages, who treated of Alchemy, from
the
most Ancient Hermes to the most Modern; they will find them all full of
various Purifications, Reductions, Sublimations, Calcinations, and the
like, of the pure Substance of Nature; and also of the Distillations
and
Circulations of the Elements, which how laborious it is, no man who is
wise is ignorant of. For the pure Substance of the Mineral Nature, is
the
Stone of the Philosophers; which before its complete Perfection, is a
rude
and undigested Mass, very much defiled by the Elemental impurity, which
though it may attain the highest Purity (namely, that it became a mere
Fire, for the Stone itself is nothing else but mere Fire concentrated
into
one Thing) it requires very great Labour. But nevertheless (despising
the
Doctrine of the Ancients) these new Chymists and fraudulent gang,
endeavor
to obtain without any Labour and Industry, that which God hath given
only
to the Laborious; but they are deceived, and with themselves deceive
may
Persons who are Ignorant, credulous and Covetous of Gold; wherefore
also
for their sake, the true Art of Alchemy is esteemed as an unprofitable
Juggle. For it is a far other work to divide and sublime Gold than they
fancy; to the operation of which I will now apply myself. </p>
  <p>Take the Gold reduced by Mercury and distil it and there will
distil
a Water of Gold; which being done, the Air of Gold will distill, and
when
this is over, then will distil the bloody and splendid Fire of Gold;
and
the Earth, as the fourth Element, remains in the bottom. Which take and
assate it gently upon a gentle Fire, and when it is assated, take the
distilled
Air and pour it upon the Earth, and circulate till you have conjoined
the
Air and Earth. Then distill, and the Earth will distill in the Belly of
the Air, and be suspended in it. This is a great Mystery, that the
Earth
should be suspended in it. This is a great Mystery, that the Earth
should
be suspended in the Air, and almost incredible, unless it could be
occularly
demonstrated. Now take you Earth suspended in the Belly of the Air, and
decoct it with Fire of Gold till it grow red, which is the great
Elixir,
which may be multiplied infinitely. O Wonderful nature! Who permits the
Earth to be suspended in the Bosom of the Air, and also to inhabit with
the Fire! Thou verily are wonderful, because thy Operations are
wonderful.
Hermes was very well acquainted with thee, when he said, Separate the
Earth
from the Fire, the thin from the Thick, sweetly, and with great
ingenuity.
It ascends from Earth to heaven, and again it descends to the Earth,
and
receives the Virtue of the Superiors and Inferiors; and so the world is
created. This Praxis of mercury (which nevertheless is not that vulgar
Mercury which is sold by the Apothecaries which the Alchymists so
wonderfully
Torture, but another) is very good, and not only the Understanding, but
also to the Working of which I could wish that all Worthy and Pious
persons
might attain; for whose sake I will subjoin the following Praxis for
their
greater illumination in the said Mercurial Praxis. </p>
  <p><b>The Second Praxis of Mars ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Crocus Martis, not vulgar, but calcined, and made purple red
by
Spirit of (also not vulgar) Vitriol, and dissolve that Crocus in new
Spirit
will be very well Tinged; which decant, and circulate so long, till the
tincture by the operation of the Spirit upon it, begins to be Volatile,
then distill, and again pour the distilled water upon the remainder,
reiterating
and cohobating soften, till the Tincture ascend together with the
Water,
which is the Tincture of Mars extracted from the Earth of our Chalybs,
which distill divers times by itself; then take what remains, out of
which
you have extracted the Martial Tincture, and calcine it gently, out of
which so calcined by gentle Coction, by a certain Art extract the Salt,
which purify very carefully, calcining, dissolving and distilling
soften,
till it is pure and passes into red, as the innate colour of this
Martial
Minera, and dissolve it in the said red Tincture, and put both into a
glass
Vessel very well closed, and decoct them both till they are fixed in a
strong Fire. With this Tincture of Mars (circulated upon Gold) you must
ferment, and again fix it; which if it be done thrice (namely fermented
with the fermental Tincture) it will be a particular Elixir, whereof
one
part fixes 1500 parts of Venus into Sol. </p>
  <p><b>The Third Praxis of the Fixed Body ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take the Fixed Body which you very well know (which must be very
pure)
and dissolved, put it presently to the Fire, and diligently the Phlegm,
which cast away, and when a certain acid water distills, change the
Receiver,
and take it and when the Vessels are cool, pour this water again upon
the
remainder, and dissolve it in a warm heat; and when it is dissolved put
it again presently to a distilling Fore, and distill first the Phlegm,
which cast away (for this water in which the Body is dissolved, is like
the Spirit of Wine, for it attracts a Watery Phlegm) and when the acid
water distills, change the Receiver and take it, as you did before.
Continue
this work of cohobating and dephlegming for six times. Then take the
Matter
which is in the Vessel, and is very much corrupted, grind it subtly,
and
put it in a glass vessel, and sublime it by degrees of Fire, and put it
in a glass vessel, and sublime it by degrees of Fire, and take this
sublimed
Mercury and dissolve it into Water with its own Water, and when you
have
this Water, take Luna finely laminated, and cast it into that Water;
and
when it is dissolved, distill the Water from the Luna, and what
distills,
pour again upon the remaining Silver, reiterating so often till you see
the Luna turned into an Oil by Cohobation of this Water upon it. Then
take
this Oil and put it to the Water with which the Luna was turned into an
Oil, and mix them both well, and put them into a strong Vessel strongly
closed, and put it into Ashes, and digest 120 days till they are fixed
into a white powder, which take and dissolve in the Oil with its Water;
and when it is dissolved, digest it after the same manner as you did
before,
reiterating this Work so often, till this Powder flow like Wax, without
fume. And here ii is to be noted, that after the Second Fermentation
with
the Oil, they are fixed in a shorter time. </p>
  <p>And this Tincture tinges much Venus into Luna. </p>
  <p><b>The Fourth Praxis of the Green Lyon ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take the Substance which in the first Book I named the Green Lyon,
for
that is our Gold, living, and green, of a Saline Nature, produced by
Nature
out of the pure Substance of the Elements. Dissolve and congeal this,
so
often reiterating, till it flows without fuming, which that it may be
more
easily brought to pass, this Gold in every Solution must be dissolved
in
its own Water. When this Gold flows as Wax, take it and dissolve it in
that Water in which our glorious earth is resolved, and to very pound
of
Gold put half a pound of the glorious Earth dissolved in its own Water;
and when the Gold is dissolved, digest it for 20 days in a warm place,
and separated (the Feces which during the Circulation, fall to the
bottom)
by Decantation. </p>
  <p>Then take this Liquor and put it into a Retort, and distill with a
very
gentle Fire as much as you can of the Phlegm; and when that it over,
which
you may discern by the taste, put out the Fire and cease Distillation,
and when the Liquor is cold, weigh it, and if it weigh three pounds,
take
vulgar Gold, and make a red Calx of it after the Vulgar manner, and
free
it from all corrosives, dry it, and put it into a circulatory (0f this
calx there must be half a Pound) and put to it the above said three
pounds
of Liquor. Then close the Vessel, and circulate in Balneo for 40 days,
in which time you will see it will be all plainly resolved. Now
distill,
and what you distill, pour again upon what remains, reiterating till
all
what remains, be turned into Oil of a Golden Colour, thick and fat,
which
separate from its Feces by Decantation, and circulate it for 20 days,
in
which time it will become much Thicker and Fatter. </p>
  <p>Of this one part tinges 200 parts of Luna into Gold. Because the
glorious
Earth is necessary to this process, and for the making of it, I have
not
given so particular a manner, I will also add the Praxis of this Divine
Substance, for the sake of all those who seek this Art for the Honor of
God, and the good of their Neighbor. </p>
  <p><b>The Fifth Praxis of the Glorious Earth ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take the black Earth, which is also called Litharge, and put it
into
a Retort well luted, and distill it, and rectify well all which
distils,
then take the Caput Mortuum and powder it very well, for that is our
black
and obscure coloured Laton, which must be whitened, and its blackness
taken
from it, according to the Philosophers, who say, Wash Laton and tear
your
Books, lest your Hearts be broken. </p>
  <p>Take therefore this Laton, and powder it in a glass Mortar, with a
Pestle
of the same mater, and when you have powdered it, assate it gently upon
the Fire, then put it into a glass, and pour upon it that which you
before
distilled; then shut the glass and circulate the matter; and when it is
circulated, distill it, and what you distill is Our mercury. Pour this
again upon what remains, and digest, and then distill, and when all is
distilled, increase the Fire, and our Glorious Earth will sublime,
which
is Our Fire subtilized, Our Sulphur and Our Diana, which being so
prepared,
burns Gold to Ashes, out of which is extracted the Aurum Potabile,
whose
use is very great in restoring lost Strength. </p>
  <p><b>The Sixth Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take the Glorious Earth duly prepared, as much as you please, and
calcine
it gently, and put to this in weight of our Mercury, mix them well,
then
distill with a strong Fire, and urge as much as will ascend, and pour
all
which distills, upon the remaining part, and distill, and with a good
strong
Fire there will distill a thick, clear and gummy Liquor. Circulate this
by itself 25 days; then rectify it by itself four times, the dephlegm
it;
and this is our Mercury triumphant, in which dissolve Gold, and by
circulation
make it an Oil, circulate this Oil till it be a dry matter. Imbibe this
with the above said thick mercury and fix it, which reiterate three
times.
Then take this Mass, and separate it from the Feces, as well as may be,
by Sublimation, and what sublimes, decoct and imbibe with our
Triumphant
Mercury, and fix it soften till it is fixed, flowing and Tinges. This
way
is short, and is very powerful in transmutation of Metals. </p>
  <p><b>The Seventh Praxis of Cinnabar ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take red Cinnabar made of mercury Vive by means of Sulphur, Powder
this
very well, and pour upon it Spirit of Salt very well rectified two
pounds,
and mix them very well (and note, that in the mixing them, the glass
will
grow very hot, which heat comes from the Internal Sulphur and Mercurial
Fire of the Cinnabar) then put it in Balneo and Circulate for a long
time.
Then distill, and pour all the Spirit of Salt which distills, again
upon
the Cinnabar, and distill again, reiterating so often, till the Spirit
of Salt ascends very red as Blood, which distill gently in Balneo, and
the Spirit of Salt will distill, but the Tincture of Cinnabar will
remain,
which keep, and pour the Spirit of Salt to the remaining Cinnabar
again,
and extract the Tincture as you did before, and if all the Mercurial
Sulphur
be so extracted out of the Cinnabar, and the Spirit of Salt also
distilled
from the Tinctures; then keep the Oil of Cinnabar, and pour again the
Spirit
of Salt to the remaining Cinnabar, and digest and distill at last with
a strong Fire, and the Sublimed Mercury will distill like crystal;
which
dissolve in the Oil of Cinnabar, and mix both very well, and distill
them
into one red Liquor which is very precious. </p>
  <p><b>The Eighth Praxis ~</b> </p>
  <p>Make a Spirit of Mercury Vive, and when you have well dephlegmed
and
rectified it, put it into a good strong glass, and put it to the Fire,
and when the Spirit is warm, cast in a little of the Corporeal Mercury,
so often till it becomes thick, then increase the Fire, and all will be
dissolved, then decoct this mixture till it be dry; then take new
Spirit
of Mercury divers times; and if you now see your Mercury like a Rose in
the bottom, then take this Mercury and powder it subtly, and put it
into
a glass firmly closed, and digest it 15 days with a good strong Fire;
and
you will perceive the matter to be fat; which circulate till it be
again
thin, then put it to the Fire, and separate the pure from the impure,
and
distill the pure, and there will distill a very subtle Spirit, and what
remains, will be like Frogs&#8217; Spawn, but whiter and more bright. Now
take
the thin and distilled Spirit, and pour it upon the remaining matter;
digest,
distill, and cohobate, till this thick Oil ascend together with the
Thin
Spirit, and when it is in the Receiver, it swims above the Spirit, and
is bright as Crystal, which Separate, and circulate by itself; then
distill
it, and when it is distilled, circulate it upon Luna, and it will be a
good work. This is what I have spoken particularly. But I hasten to
what
follows, which is the practical way of our Mercury upon the Calx of Sol
and Luna. </p>
  <p><b>Temperate Water ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take our Glorious Earth, which being calcined, circulate with our
mercury,
distilling till they become one Water, bright and clear, which is the
Temperate
Water. </p>
  <p><b>The Use of the Temperate Water ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take Gold and amalgamate it with Mercury, and evaporate the
Mercury,
and calcine the remaining Gold, and edulcorate, till it becomes a very
spongy Powder, and purple red; which put into a circulatory, and pour
upon
it a sufficient quantity of Temperate Water, and work it by
circulation,
Distillation and cohobation till the Gold remains in the bottom in form
of a viscid Calx, and separate the superfluous water. Now when this
Calx
is prepared, the Praxis is to be ordered in the following manner: Take
of this Golden Calx and our Earth, both being very well powdered; put
to
it drop after drop, grinding it, much Mercury as you see is sufficient,
which you may easily see; then take this matter and put it into a glass
Vessel and circulate 20 days, then take it out and put it in Sand, and
distill our Mercury from the Calxes; and that which ascends after the
Mercury
in form of a Crystalline Powder, take and put to what remains, and
dissolve
it in Mercury, and distill, and it will sublime which again put to what
remains, and circulate, and distill, and there will remain the Glorious
Earth of our Gold and of our Earth, conjoined by virtue of the Natural
Fire, which take and reduce by our Mercury into a Tincture. </p>
  <p>Thus far, Friendly Reader, by the Divine Grace I am come; and
have,
with a willing mind, instructed thee by divers Praxes to make our
Golden,
Famous and so celebrated Stone, by which also, if thou be ingenious,
thou
will see what advantage you may receive from them; and how difficult
and
Herculean a Work it is to come at. But that I may conclude this little
Treatise, I will first advise thee to study to know these three
principal
things: </p>
  <p>First, that you know the true Matter, which is only one Matter,
out
of which all our practical ways must be performed. This matter lurks
everywhere,
and in all things, and for that reason it is called the Central Salt of
all things: </p>
  <p>Take this while it may yet properly be called an undetermined Hyle
and
Hidden Salt. </p>
  <p>Secondly, in the mixtion it is to be noted that the water must
predominate
over the Body; for the necessity the Body must first be dissolved in
its
water, and turned into water, before the Body can corporify the water,
and which verily must be done with very great caution, by little and
little
dissolving the Earth; for the Earth is weak in the beginning, and if
you
suffocate it with its water, there will ensue a Sea of Confusion. </p>
  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, the Regimen of the Fire must be observed,
which
must be sometimes gentle, sometimes strong, sometimes temperate,
sometimes
subtle and vaporous, according to the Operation of the Operative
Matter.
The knowledge of this Regimen is a great Secret, which above all things
the Artist must know, if he desires the wished end; Which from the
bottom
of my Heart I wish to all who are Worthy, through our Lord and Savior
Jesus
Christ. </p>

  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>I have in my two preceding Tracts so manifestly declared that Art
which
was kept so secret by the Ancient Philosophers, that they would not
reveal
it, even to their own Sons; both as to Theory and Practice: That any
Man
of a common Capacity, imploring first Divine Assistance and Blessing,
may
easily apprehend it. </p>
  <p>In the first place it is most necessary to understand the Nature
of
the matter, which the Artist worked upon, and its Purities and
Impurities,
and Active and Passive Virtues. </p>
  <p>He who knows these will attain his desired end; For in the right
Knowledge
thereof consists the true Practice. </p>
  <p>These I intend to reveal to all those who do not already know it,
But
yet with such Philosophical Caution, that the Readers hereof may not
with
unwashed hands touch these sacred Mysteries, which Almighty God from
the
Creation of the World to this day has not revealed to any but his
faithful
Servants. </p>
  <p>There are therefore Two chief Principles to be considered, namely
Air
and Fire, as an Agent, and Earth and Water as a Patient. </p>
  <p>Of these four, two of which are only Visible, is made our Mercury,
which
is a perfect Creature, for it contains the Four Elements. </p>
  <p>And here it is to be observed that Water and Earth are manifest to
sight,
and Fire and Air are hidden, which is to be understood of the gross
Matter.
But when they are circulated by the Philosophical Wheel, the Fire and
Air
are made manifest, which is the Philosophical Mercury White and Red. </p>
  <p>For in our Matter are Two Things, namely Purities and Impurities;
the
Impurities are superficial, and must be separated being Feces which
naturally
adhere to the Matter. And if they are not well separated, the Fire
cannot
operate upon the Water, not the Air upon the Earth; but pure Qualities
act one upon the other. The Fire upon the Water, and the Air upon the
Earth,
and not separately, but altogether. For the Air cannot act upon the
Earth
without the Mediation of the Two others; namely Fire and Water, and in
like manner it is to be understood of the others. </p>
  <p>But our Water is not common Water, not our Fire common Fire, for
no
Man is so senseless as to think that Water and Fire can be united. But
our Water is of a Celestial Nature, and therefore our Fire loves it. </p>
  <p>The same is to be understood of the two others, namely Air and
Earth;
Vulgar Earth is leprous, and abounds with Excrements, but our Earth is
Crystalline Green, and therefore it is called Green Gold. And our Air
is
unctuous and therefore contains Fire. </p>
  <p>The Air impregnated with Fire, is Celestial and Solar, and
therefore
has the Virtue of illuminating all Bodies, and of fixing and exalting
their
Souls, of which all Philosophers have spoken, saying, In Mercury is all
that the Wise Men seek. For in it are all the Four Elements in the
highest
Purity, and that is all the Philosophers have desired. Hence it most
clearly
appears, that the Matter of our Mercury is a perfect Body, and contains
all things which are under the Sphere of the Moon, that is to say, it
contains
all things potentially; for it contains the Essences of all things, and
therefore is the first Matter of all Things. </p>
  <p>Out of this Matter purified (for it abounds with Feces) and duly
prepared,
and if I may say so, made Spiritual, is prepared our Mercury, yet this
Matter in its first appearance is not so pure (although it be
potentially
perfect) and yet notwithstanding all the parts of our Stone are hidden
in it, and it is not apparent to sight, so that it cannot show its
Virtue,
made by an ingenious Artists, so that it may become the Mercury of the
Philosophers. </p>
  <p>If it be thus prepared it has the Virtue to vivify, illuminate and
exalt
dead gold, into the highest degree of Tincture, which no other matter
in
the World can do. And here apprehend us right, were I call it a perfect
Body, not because it is by nature brought to a complete Perfection, but
because all Perfection does both inchoate and end in it, and gave it
Power
and Virtue to exalt Gold Radically, according to the Will and Pleasure
of the Omnipotent who created it For if it were not more perfect than
Gold,
how could our Mercury extracted from it, exalt Gold? </p>
  <p>Here it may be perceived that they all incur error, who endeavor
to
make Philosophical Gold our of Minerals, and imperfect Metals, as
Vulgar
Mercury, Sulphur or Antimony. These are not perfect bodies, because the
Fire destroys them, and Gold itself is not by nature made so perfect,
but
that it may be destroyed either by Fire, Water, Air or Earth; therefore
Gold need to exalt its Virtue. </p>
  <p>This is that Miraculous Substance which contains all Things. This
is
that Crystalline Mercury always current, to which no Creature is
altogether
like: for in this, the Forms of Bodies do ascend and descend, as on a
Ladder. </p>
  <p>This is sometimes green, whose spirit if it be set at Liberty from
its
bonds, will reveal all the Essence, which before lay hid in the Center.
But these are secrets to be revealed to none, of which I dare not speak
further. </p>
  <p>I have somewhat deviated from my purpose, which was rather to
explain
the Agent and the Patient, the male and the Female, the moist and the
dry,
which are Water and Earth in their Crudity, the two principle Pillars
of
our Glorious mercury, must of necessity be perfected out of these two,
namely out of the humid and dry nature. The Male and the Female, one
must
operate upon the other, so that the operation being finished, they
might
both become one again. </p>
  <p>And consequently that which was before of a lower form, is exalted
and
made our Mercury, clear and transparent, but how difficult this
operation
is, I will hereafter show. </p>
  <p>The Earth laying in the bottom and purified, is subject to the
continual
operation of the water upon it, wcih when it once ascends on high,
again
it descends to the Bottom by drops, and by gentle Rarefaction is at
last
coagulated. </p>
  <p>At first it appears dry, then moist and viscous, then coloured
like
the Chameleon, which if it be acted upon, by the heat of a Bath, the
Earth
breaks and sublimes into a Water like Silver, which is our Glorious
Mercury.
This is the Star of the Wise Men, which being corrupted with the fiery
Water, affords the Glorious Earth, which Wise Men call Diana. </p>
  <p>But for the better understanding of this it is to be observed,
that
in this Earth called the Green Lion, when it is purified, the form of
Water
is manifested, namely the Soul, which is the Philosophers Sol, and when
the time of operation is over, both of them come forth, the Fire of the
Water, and the Air of the Earth. </p>
  <p>For then their Occult becomes manifest, as above said, for the
Water
is appropriated to the earth, as above said, for the Water is
appropriated
to the Earth, hence the Air of the Earth stirs up the Fire of the
Water,
which before by reason of cold was almost extinguished. </p>
  <p>And therefore it is that Fore doth not appear in crude Water; For
the
Water imprisons it, as the Blood encloses the Vital Spirit. </p>
  <p>This Water is fat as a Subtle Oil, and therefore may be coagulated
by
the Earth, for this was Water before, and therefore s friendly to Water
as abovesaid. And here you may observe the difference between Vulgar
and
Philosophical Waters; but the common Man does not understand the Power
of Nature, and therefore he always errs. </p>
  <p>This Water I have in my first Part called the Spirit of the Rock;
and
it is truly Rocky and Stony, and is coagulated into the Stone of the
Wise
Men. </p>
  <p>Hence the mistake of all those who work in the Vulgar Waters and
Spirits,
is easily discerned; For these cannot be coagulated, though many do
affirm
that they may; but how learned these Doctors are, every day&#8217;s
Experience
shows. </p>
  <p>Hence I understand that Water which in the Second Part I call Dew
Water,
Spirit of Wine, (whose phlegm distilled first) the Oil of Nature, the
Spirit
of Honey, the Crystalline and clear Mercury; this Water I have said is
coagulated by the Earth, and by and with it is converted into a higher
form. </p>
  <p>Here something is to be observed of which very may take no Notice.
This
Water when it is often distilled, and is made clear and Crystalline
doth
then leave behind it a White Earth, which before left a red one, and if
it has come thus far, then this Water is highly exalted in its property
of easily coagulating, and the Colours in the Operation will sooner
appear;
because it is not so crude as it was before, for the continuance of the
Colours proceed from the from the Crudity of the Matter and though it
be
distilled, yet it is in some sort Mature. For even distribution does
Maturate,
although it elevated it, which the Chymists will not believe. For
Maturation
does not differ much from Purification, and pure things approach more
to
maturity than impure things, which the Vulgar also Know, though they
are
not Philosophers, and yet in this Art, it is a great secret, and the
Learned
Doctors do often seem to say the contrary, and from hence it happens
that
the sayings of philosophers are understood by few. </p>
  <p>I have in some measure described the matter and its parts, namely
Water
and Earth, of which the operation of our Mercury consists, now I will
proceed
to the Secret Operations which occur in the practice. </p>
  <p>Water and Earth must be conjoined, namely the Spirit, Soul and
Body;
these three which are involved in dark Feces must be purified, but this
is rather a Regeneration. </p>
  <p>For the Earth must be Crystalline and flowing, the Soul Tingeing
and
resplendent, and the spirit serene and freed from all spots, but to
arrive
thus far is a difficult point. </p>
  <p>The Intention of the Artist in this case, ought to be directed to
this
end that the may make the Water dissolve the Earth, so that the Power
of
this one may be overcome by the other, namely that the Water may
convert
the Earth into its own nature. </p>
  <p>This is the best Operation for by this means the power of the
Earth
is augmented by the Virtue of the Water, that it may be the better
coagulated. </p>
  <p>But here it is to be observed, that this is an operation more
difficult
than the rest, which the Ancient Philosophers called the Conversion of
the Elements, and said that in it consisted all the Art. </p>
  <p>Verily it is difficult to operate with the Elements, yet the
Philosophers
have proceeded so far, that even in their Glasses they can make a
Coagulation
of the Elements in this Praxis of the body is the Agent, though it be
dissolved
into water, for in this Solution the power of the Earth is set free
from
its Bonds, and acts upon the Water, for no Water fan better be
coagulated
than that into which the power of the Earth is introduced, which is
plain
and evident. </p>
  <p>Hence it is that in every Conversion of the Elements, this
Practical
Operation must always be observed, which proceeds the real
Transmutation
of both, namely of the Earth and Water, as we have said, only that the
power of the dissolving Water, may wholly contain the dissolved Earth. </p>
  <p>So that before the real Transmutation there may be made a Solution
per
Minima and this is a great secret known to very few, particularly to
those
who know not the Philosophical Dissolution, and operation before the
Transmutation. </p>
  <p>Here are three things to be noted, first that the Earth must be
light
and porous, and light and not compact and solid; for so the Water doth
better enter it with its subtle humidity and restores the Virtue, which
was lost by Calcination, and augments the innate heat, in a light,
insensible
and friendly way. </p>
  <p>Secondly, that the Earth must be dry and the superfluous humidity,
dulling
the natural heat must be well extracted from the earth by various
solutions
and Coagulations, for these humidities hinder the coagulating Virtue.
And
both these Operations must preceed the Solution. </p>
  <p>Thirdly, above all, care must be taken in the solution of the
Earth
when the same be dissolved gently per Minima, with a long trituration,
so that the virtue of the Water does not too suddenly lay hold on the
Virtue
of the Earth, for the Earth is weakened by divers Calcinations and
purifications,
even to Death; hence proceeds a subtle Error of many in this difficult
solution, in which it must be observed, that they do not debilitate the
Virtue of the Earth by Addition of too much Water, and make a sea of
confusion,
a Pelagus Contserbationis. </p>
  <p>This is what I have to say of Solution. </p>
  <p>Now I will speak of Transmutation. </p>
  <p>It is known that the dry elements mixed per Minima, with the
humid,
are easily altered and corrupted, for they are of one and the same
nature,
the Male and the Female, the one acts upon the other, the Earth upon
the
Water, coagulating the Water into earth, lifting the same up by a
contrary
operation, by means of External Fire. </p>
  <p>Here the Seed of the Earth mixes itself with the Seed of the
Water,
so as they can never be separated, for the seeds do here operate so
long
till they are overwhelmed with the darkness of the night and are
inspissated
into a Viscous Glue, whose Superficies are of a green and livid colour,
as the signs of a sick and languishing Complexion, for it is the
beginning
of Alteration. </p>
  <p>Here the Spirit of the Volatile substance endeavors to free the
Spirit
of the Green Soul from its Corporeal Prison, and to join itself with
it. </p>
  <p>Here the Body so far as it is able resists the Spirit (least this
Volatile
and insatiable Enemy should devour its soul) and carries it into the
Black
Prison; for if this soul be freed from the body, then Blackness appears
not in the Work, it is a sign that the soul which lies hid in the Body,
is not set at Liberty nor dissolved; for that is the Medium which
conjoined
the Spirit, Soul and Body, and causes one to have Ingress into the
other. </p>
  <p>For it is the Workman of Nature, and as long as the soul lies
hidden
in the Inward parts of the Body, it cannot become a Medium of
conjoining
the Spirit with the Body. </p>
  <p>Here give good heed, that you may amend this error, if you happen
to
commit it, but this Body is Salt, this Soul lies therein enclosed, for
it that which must hold together, namely the Spirit, Body and Soul, and
cause that one have ingress into another; but if this is not done,
there
is no Conjunction, which is like Black Pitch. In this Salt is also the
Tincture which is not dissolved, but in this soul, hence it is called
Putrefaction,
but only a solution of the splendor. </p>
  <p>For Salt cannot be putrefied, therefore the putrefaction of the
Philosophers
is described after such wonderful manner, as that it is an Alteration
into
a better form. </p>
  <p>Salt may be altered by the Fire of the living Water, which is the
way
to the Alteration of it. </p>
  <p>Therefore also it is not to be wondered at, that when our Water is
joined
with our Earth, both of them are never at rest, but change from one
Complexion
to another, from one Colour to another, namely, White, Red, and Black,
and infinite other Colours, which alterations ceases not until they
come
to a Resurrection, and become much more powerful in Virtue than they
were
before, because when they are altered, they renew themselves to much
greater
strength, therefore Resurrection is not a new Creation but only an
Exaltation.
I have described this operation practically and largely enough in the
preceding
Books, which Lully has delivered so obscurely, and that not without
reason;
for it is the Key of the Work as he confuses in his Codicil and
Testament,
and that he had revealed to him by his Master. </p>
  <p>But not only Lully has hidden it, but also Ripley, and infinite
other
philosophers being overly envious, and so not willing to reveal so
great
a Treasure, lest Pearls should be cast before Swine. Verily I know none
amongst them all that has so freely opened it with all its
circumstances
as I have. </p>
  <p>For the Ancient and Modern Philosophers were as void of Charity as
they
were abounding in Riches. </p>
  <p>You may abundantly see the Manuductions to this practice, in the
first
Praxis of the Second Book, of the Masculine Earth of Salt (rather Sol)
and water of Dew. Also in the seventh Praxis, of the vegetable Body of
the Minera of Saturn, also in the praxis of the glorious Mercury, of
the
Vegetable, Animal and Mineral body, and the Rock Water. Also in the
eighth
Praxis, of Sugar, and the Spirit of Honey. </p>
  <p>But most clearly in the Second Chapter in the Second Book, of the
Serene
Crystalline Mercury and Calcined Gold, in which every searcher may most
clearly see the Solution of the Body in its Water, per Minima, and its
Transmutation into another Nature, and also its full Exaltation
together
with its Water into the Mercury of the Philosophers. </p>
  <p>Therefore this principal operation of our mercury being known, it
is
also necessary that the Earth and Water, out of which such operation
must
proceed, be exactly known, and from whence they must be had, for these
being unknown, the solution cannot be accomplished. I have said above
that
there is one Matter out of which our Mercury is extracted, which is
divided
into two parts, namely Water and earth by distillation. See this Praxis
in the Second Book, in the Fifth Praxis, where our matter is mixed with
Vitriol Calcined, as a Medium whereby the Water may better leave the
Earth. </p>
  <p>Also in the Sixth Praxis, of Urine. Also in the Ninth Praxis, of
the
Minera of the Red Earth. And in the Second Chapter of the said booking
the Eighth Praxis of the Spirit of mercury, with all requisite
Manuductions,
are perfectly taught. </p>
  <p>The Earth and Water being now had, it is necessary first that both
be
purified; the Water is purified by seven or more Distillations, and is
circulated afterwards into a Quintessence of the First Order. See this
Operation in the Fifth Praxis, Book Two, of the Salt of Saturn, where
the
Water is rectified. Also in the Praxis of Urine were it is seven times
distilled, also in the First Praxis of the Second Chapter in the Second
Book, of the Mercury, where this Water is seven times sublimed in a
long
time, and freed from its Corrosive and Phlegmatic Excrements. This
Water
so prepared in our precedent Book, is called the Spirit of Mercury Vive
--- Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Vitriol, Crystalline and serene Mercury,
Spirit of Honey, the Water of the Rock containing the Soul of the
Elements,
Aqua Vitae, of Red Wine, Dew Water, etc. </p>
  <p>But as to the Earth, that is purified by Calcinations and
Separations,
by means of the Natural Agent, for it must be calcined, digested, made
fluid, and reduced into a Porousness and Redness, which are verily
difficult
Operations, the Praxis of which see in the Second Book, Second Praxis,
of Calx Vive, where this Earth is calcined to a redness by a dry Fire,
the Praxis of which see in the4 Second Book, Praxis of Calx Vive, where
this Earth is calcined to a redness, by a dry Fire. Also in the Third
Praxis,
of the Salt of Tartar, where the earth is calcined into a Porousness.
Also
in Second Chapter of the Second Book, in the Praxis of Mercury, where
the
Earth is amalgamated with the Water and is so often dried till the
Nature
of the Water be sufficiently introduced into it. Also in the Praxis of
the Green Lyon, where the Earth is soften dissolved and purified, till
it flows like Wax. </p>
  <p>This Earth in our Book is called Salt, Red Cinnabar, the Green
Lyon,
Crocus Martis, Gold, White Sugar Candy, Mercury --- the Vegetable Body
from the Minera of Saturn, Salt of Tartar, Calx Vive, etc. </p>
  <p>This operation of the Earth is difficult and Secret and must be
performed
before the Water be joined with it to make our Mercury. The Operation
of
which, the Searcher has here openly discovered to him, and may easily
accomplish,
unless he be an Artist of a dull Capacity. </p>
  <p>Although the pure Earth be joined with the pure Water, per Minima,
and
transmuted into an higher Form, yet our Mercury wants still another
Operation
to its Perfection. For after the Black and White Colours are past over,
the matter must be sublimed and separated from some more subtle
Excrements;
namely from those which were not separated in the former operations. </p>
  <p>This operation you may see, passing in the Practices of the first
and
second Book, then our Mercury will be prepared. </p>
  <p>But before I proceed further, I will reveal a great Secret. Our
actuated
before it be joined with the earth, must be prepared into a
Quintessence,
namely, as it must be blue, green unctuous and ponderous, and not
miscible
with common Water. This admirable secret lurks in Vitriol and Urine;
for
the Golden Seed is in the Vitriol, and the mercurial in Urine. Hence
these
two have great Affinity. Here take notice that the Philosophers do
frequently
say nothing but their uintessence circulated for a long time, mixes
itself
with Gold bodies, as I have said above. This liquor thus circulated
with
Gold bodies, as I have said above. This liquor thus circulated abounds
with a soul of an Earthly substance, therefore the Earth does easily
admit
it. For after both are mixed, the Earth which before was hard black and
light and porous is now become fluid, white and heavy, and compact and
of most easy sublimation. </p>
  <p>And here note that as often as this Liquor is sublimed with the
Earth,
so often it is made more subtle and Vehement in Operation: So that no
liquor
in the whole Mineral Kingdom is so subtle and Vehement: and which is
wonderful
it is scarce discerned in the Glass wherein it is, by reason of the
Fire
which it carries in its belly, and therefore fixes everything with
which
it is mixed. </p>
  <p>I should say more of this glorious substance, if it were lawful to
cast
Pearls before Swine. All mankind loves nothing more than Gold, and
since
that comes now in my way, I will teach the way of making it, out of the
baser Metals: which making many have called transmutation, and that
rightly,
for it is a Transmutation of a baser form into a better, without
hurting
those things which make the Tincture, for where light is introduced,
Darkness
ceases, therefore these three things are to be considered, viz., the
Confection,
the Transmutation and Introduction. </p>
  <p>The ancient Philosophers out of a zealous Piety and Charity made
light
accomp of this Operation, searching a Medicine healthful to mankind,
which
is quite contrary to men of our age, for God is their Idol, and they
despise
Spiritual Treasures, as the rest of the World do. </p>
  <p>The Mercury of the Philosophers being now very well prepared,
rectified
and glorified (for it also needs Glorification) and the Glorious Earth
being in the same manner prepared they must be mixed accordingly to the
proportion of Nature with the souls of Gold by divers operations, in a
long time, till all thicken as may be seen in the first and second
Book;
then take this Matter (for in it lies all which is necessary to this
Work)
and Work it till it grows fulgent as a Pearl --- Then decoct it to
blackness
with a gentle and moderate Fire, then into Whiteness, first passing
through
other colours (which I will not here mention being sufficiently
described
in other Books) and lastly into Redness. </p>
  <p>Work this Stone imbibing it by little and little with the Soul of
the
Gold, till it be absolutely perfect, red and fulgent. </p>
  <p>This operation is plainly described in the first and second Books,
and
therefore I will not here describe it more plainly, since I have done
it
already; not for the sake of such as love Gold, and of those whose
Heaven
is in this present life, but for the sake of good men and well
deserving
in this Art, and of those whose Treasures lies no in the Things of this
World, but in things spiritual and Celestial expecting the last coming
of one Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. </p>
  <p>I have been more prolix in this Discourse than I intended and
therefore
O will hasten to a Conclusion --- but a fear I make music to the Deaf,
for in this Age the World is Governed by Opinion. So many men, so many
opinions, which many times are as absurd, as impossible: so that some
affirm
the White to Black, and yet these are the great Doctors, and wise
Philosophers,
and oftentimes the Expounders and Commentators of the Adepts. </p>
  <p>Vain Ostentation! And foolish Ignorance of Man! O miserable and
empty
Philosophers, fit to be banished and excluded from the Conversation of
Men, and these are to be shunned more than poison for they are the
Corrupters
of true Natural Philosophy, but enough of these Men. </p>
  <p>Now I will speak of Urine and Vitriol, in which that so much
wonderful
secret of our Quintessence lies hid; which few know, and very many will
not believe, for it is hidden by Divine Providence, lest the Ignorant
and
Vulgar should know it as well as the Wise men. </p>
  <p>Vitriol is a salt, which (not without weighty Consideration) is
taken
into the Composition of the Quintessence; For it is a Salt of the
Nature
of Fire, full of Tincture, Red and White, and often black, persevering
in the Fire, of a Vegetable Nature, and therefore it is green and
yields
a green Tincture in Vinegar. Such is our Vitriol, much different from
common
Vitriol, whose qualities are not so noble and powerful, nor so fixed
and
Tingeing as the qualities of this Golden Vitriol. </p>
  <p>For it as so wonderful a Tincture as is scarce credible, because
of
the great Projection, which it makes upon Venus which it turns into
pure
Gold. </p>
  <p>This is such a Tingeing Substance as none in the world is equal to
it;
this Vitriol is found everywhere, and is of most vile price: It is sold
everywhere, and no Creature can live without it; for in it is shut up
that
ethereal Nectar, the nutritive Substance of all things, and here also
fixed,
that it therefore may operate so much the stronger. Behold now I have
clearly
described it, and if you do not apprehend me, you ought to confess
yourself
ignorant, because the Description of this substance is so clear. </p>
  <p>This Vitriol as I have said, has a golden seed, therefore it is
green
to the sight in Virtue, and therefore called the Vegetable Saturnia:
This
Greenness is visible till it is set at liberty from its Bonds: For when
it is set free it is red and no longer green and consequently more
perfect. </p>
  <p>This red spirit is the principal part of our Quintessence, for all
that
is fixed Volatile and dissolved by it (the Fifth Essence) is done by
this
circulated Spirit. Reader, if you know it keep it secret, for it is the
first step to our secret Fountain, and if this green and red Spirit of
Vitriol, be unknown, this Fountain is not found. </p>
  <p>As to what concerned Urine, I will make no large description of
it,
for all men know what Urine is, yea boys and girls know how to
discourse
of it. </p>
  <p>This substance which now I call Urine, because it is so vile, and
to
be found everywhere, and is on the power of all, therefore it is
lightly
esteemed. </p>
  <p>But if Men knew the Virtue and Power of this Urine, they would
seek
it to the end of the Worlds. Therefore wise Men knowing its inward
fiery
and hot, and its outward cold and moist qualities, have called it by
the
name of Urine of Saturn, and this not without weighty reason, which it
is not lawful to reveal to the unworthy. Therefore Geber, speaking of
Sulphur
has partly hinted these Noble qualities which Urine contains, says: ---
  </p>
  <p>By the Most High God it is that which illuminates every Body, and
it
is a Light from a Light and Tincture. </p>
  <p>Verily these are Weighty Words, which do show the splendour, Light
and
Tincture of this Urine. For it is known to Vulgar Chymists, that out of
the Urine, common to Men and Beasts (which nevertheless differs much
from
the Urine of Saturn ) that lucid Liquor called Phosphorus is prepared;
and why should not out of Urine (which inwardly is almost wholly fiery)
be prepared this lucid and splendent Salt, by the Philosophers commonly
called Diana. </p>
  <p>This lucid Salt in our Quintessence is of so great Efficiency,
that
it vivifies and illuminates dead Gold, this Salt before its preparation
is merely phlegmatic, stinking and black (for Urine putrefies grows
black)
but after its preparation and fiery circulation it is sweet smelling,
most
white, flowing and splenent;sometimes also it viscous as Oil (but
selfdom)
for then it is brought to the highest degree of perfection, and
hitherto
few have attained to it. This Oil when it is distilled, gives a Light,
and swims upon the Quintessence, and is endowed with so much purity and
subtlety, that it can scarce be separated from our Glorious Liquor. But
is is separated by a gentle abstraction of the Quintessence, leaving
this
subtle Oil in the bottom of the Cucurbit, which must be once more
rectified,
that it may become more pure. </p>
  <p>This Oil has wonderful Effect in Transmutation upon Mercury, for
it
easily flows, and is of most subtle Penetration. </p>
  <p>These things lie hid in Urine, a subject to vile and despicable,
Secret
of our Quintessence lies hid: For this liquor participates of both
Natures,
the Sulphureous and Mercurial part. </p>
  <p>These are those two Substances, which in my foregoing Books I
called
Sulphur and Mercury, and without which nothing is performed in the
Work. </p>
  <p>Study therefore to know these for they are the Roots of the
Physical
Works, and now I will conclude this discourse. </p>
  <p>Study very diligently what I have said scatteringly in these three
little
Tracts, namely to know the force of nature, its active and passive
power,
and lastly to know thyself. These are the principal materials of this
Art,
which if you take for you Foundation, you will work well; for knowing
the
force of Nature, you will know the possibility; Knowing the Operation,
you will know the theory; Knowing the Active and passive Power, you
will
know the Practice: And knowing yourself, you will find all which you
seek
for, </p>
  <p>These are the Mirrors in which you will see all Things Sublunarly,
and
believe me upon my word, unless these be your Foundations you will find
nothing. For they are the way which leads to the Castle of Wisdom:
Behold
they are difficult ways for Wordlings, into which it will be impossible
for them to enter. Hence comes the small number of Adepts, and
multitudes
of false Philosophers, for the former overcome the difficulty with
humility,
and become Victors, the latter with prided contend for lighter things
and
are overcome. </p>
  <p>Therefore pray unto God the Creator, who is Almighty and Merciful,
and
will not forsake thee, if thou art of a good heart and mind, and will
assuredly
prosperity undertaking. </p>
