<center><b><font size=+1>The Vision of Hermes</font></b></center>

<p>It chanced once on a time, while I was meditating on the things that
are, my thought was raised to a great height, yet my bodily senses had
been put under restraint as in sleep, though not such sleep as that of
men weighed down by fullness of food or bodily weariness. Methought a Being
more than vast, in size beyond all bounds, called out my name and said:
<p>"What would you hear and see, and what have you in mind to learn and
know?"
<p>"Who are you?" said I.
<p>"I am the Pymander, Divine Mind of the Sovereignity, the Shepherd of
Men. I know what you desire, and I am with you everywhere."
<p>"I long to learn the things that are, " I replied, "and comprehend their
nature, and know God. This is what I desire to hear."
<p>"Hold in your mind all you would know," the Shepherd answered back to
me, "and I will teach you."
<p>
<hr WIDTH="61%">

<center><b><font size=+1>The Above and the Below</font></b></center>

<p>Forthwith all things changed in aspect before me and were opened out
in an instant. And I beheld a boundless view: all was changed into Light,
a mild and joyous Light; and I marveled when I saw it. And in a little
while, there came to be in one part a downward-tending darkness, terrible
and grim, and methought it like unto a snake. And thereafter I saw the
darkness changing into a Watery Substance, which was unspeakably tossed
about. Coiling in sinuous folds, it gave forth smoke as from fire; and
I heard it making an indescribable sound of lamentation, for there was
sent forth from it an inarticulate Cry. But from the Light there came forth
a holy Speech, which took its stand upon the Watery Substance, and methought
this Word was the voice of the Light. And the Divine Mind spoke for me
to hear:
<p>"That Light is I, even the One Mind, the first God, who was before the
Watery Substance that appeared out of Darkness, and the Word which came
forth from the Light is son of God. Learn my meaning by looking at what
you yourself have in you, for in you too, the Word is son, and Mind the
father of the Word. They are not separate one from the other, for Life
is the union of Word and Mind. Now fix your thought upon the Light and
learn to know it."
<p>I saw in my mind that the Light consisted of innumerable Powers and
had come to be an ordered world, but a world without the bounds of material
existence. This I perceived in thought, seeing it by reason of the words
that the Divine Mind had spoken to me. And when I was amazed, he spoke
again to me:
<p>"You have seen in your mind the archetypal form, which is prior to the
beginning of things and is limitless."
<p>
<hr WIDTH="61%">

<center><b><font size=+1>The First Emanation: Descent of the Logos</font></b></center>

<p>"But tell me," I asked. "Whence did the elements of nature come into
being?"
<p>"They issued from God’s Purpose," came the answer, "which beheld that
beauteous world and copied it. The Watery Substance, the One Thing, having
received the Word, was fashioned into an ordered world, the elements being
separated out from it. And from the elements came forth the brood of living
creatures. And the One Mind, that Mind of Life and Light, being male and
female both, gave birth to another Mind, which was a maker of things; and
this made out of the elements Seven Planetary Administrators who encompass
with their orbits the world perceived by sense; and their administration
is called Fate.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="61%">
<br><a NAME="4"></a>
<center><b><font size=+1>The Second Emanation: Mind the Maker</font></b></center>

<p>"And forthwith, the Word of God leapt up from the downward-tending elements
of Nature to the pure body of the highest Sphere that had already existed
and united with Mind the Maker, for the Word was of one substance with
that mind too. And the downward-tending elements of Nature were left devoid
of reason, so as to be mere matter.
<p>"Then Mind the Maker united with Reason, and He who surrounds the Spheres
and spins them with His whirl, set turning His formations, and let them
turn from a beginning boundless unto an endless end. For the circulation
of these Spheres begins where it does end in a circle, as Mind does will.
And from the downward-tending elements Nature brought forth lives without
reason; for He did not extend Reason (the Logos) to them. The Air brought
forth things winged; the Water things that swim, and in the Watery Substance,
Earth-and-Water one from another were separated, as Mind the Maker willed.
And from her bosom, Nature produced living things, four-footed animals
and reptiles, beasts wild and tame.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="61%">
<br><a NAME="5"></a>
<center><b><font size=+1>The Third Emanation: The Descent of Man</font></b></center>

<p>"But the One Mind, being both Life and Light, next brought forth Man,
a Being like to Himself, with whom He fell in love, as being His own child;
for it was beautiful beyond compare, the Image of its Sire. In very truth,
God fell in love with His own Form; and on it did bestow all of His own
creations. And when Man gazed upon what Mind the Maker had created in the
region of Fire, he too wished to create and so assent was given him by
the Father. Changing his state to the formative Sphere, where he was to
have his whole authority, Man had in himself all the workings of the archetypal
Administrators. Likewise, they fell in love with him, and each gave him
a share of their own ordering. And after that, Man had well learned their
essence and had become a sharer in their nature. Man then had a mind to
break right through the boundary of their Spheres, and to subdue the might
of that which pressed upon the Fire.
<p>"So he who had the whole authority, having learned the being of the
Administrators, willed to break through the Spheres and showed to downward-tending
Nature God's fair Form. And when Nature saw that Form of beauty that can
never satiate, and Man who now possessed within himself each single energy
of all Seven Administrators as well as God's own Form, she smiled with
love; for it was as though she had seen the image of God's fairest form
upon her Water, His shadow on her Earth.
<p>"He in His turn beholding the Form like to Himself, existing in her,
in her Water, loved it and willed to live in it; and with the will came
actuality, and so Man vivified the Form devoid of reason. And Nature took
the object of her love and wound herself completely round him, and they
were intermingled, for they were lovers. And this is why beyond all creatures
on the earth, Man is twofold: mortal because of body, but because of his
essential Eternal Substance, immortal. Though deathless and possessed of
sway over all, yet does Man suffer as a mortal does, subject to Fate. Thus,
though his true nature is above the Spheres, within the Spheres he has
become a slave. Though male-female, he is from a male-female Mind; and
though he is sleepless from a sleepless Sire, yet is he overcome by sleep.
<p>

<center><b><font size=+1>The First Men</font></b></center>

<p>Thereon I say: "Teach on, Oh Divine Mind of me, for I myself as well
am amorous of the Word."
<p>And the Shepherd said: "This is the mystery kept hid until this day:
Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder, oh so wonderful. For as
he had the nature of the Concord of the Seven, who, as I said to you, were
made of Fire and Spirit. Nature did not delay but immediately brought forth
seven men, in correspondence with the natures of the Seven Administrators,
male-female were they and moving in the air."
<p>"0h Shepherd, " I said, "for now I'm filled with great desire and long
to hear; do not run off!"
<p>"Keep silence," said the Shepherd, "for not as you have I unrolled for
you the first discourse."
<p>"Lo! I am still," said I.
<p>"In such wise then," the Shepherd continued, "the generation of these
Seven came to pass. Earth was as woman, her Water filled with longing;
ripeness she took from Fire, spirit from Ether. Nature thus brought forth
frames to suit the Form of Man. And Man from Life and Light changed into
soul and mind -- from Life to soul, from Light to mind. And thus continued
all the sense-world pairings until the period of their end and a new beginning
arrived. Now listen to the rest of the discourse that you long to hear:
The period being ended, the bond that bound them all was loosened by God's
Will. For all the animals being male-female, at the same time with Man
were loosed apart; some became male, some in like fashion female. And straightaway,
God spoke by His Holy Word (the Logos): 'Increase you in increasing, and
multiply in multitude, you creatures and creations all; and Man that had
Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself is deathless and the
cause of death is love, though Love is All.' When He said this, His forethought
did by means of Fate and the Spheres effect their couplings and their generations
founded. And so all things were multiplied according to their kind. And
he who thus had learned to know himself, had reached that Good that does
transcend abundance; but he who through worldly love that same end leads
astray, he expends his love upon his body -- he stays in Darkness -- and
suffering through his senses the things of Death."
<p>
<hr WIDTH="61%">

<center><b><font size=+1>The Way of Deathlessness</font></b></center>

<p>"What is the fault so great the ignorant commit," I asked, "that they
should be deprived of deathlessness?"
<p>"You seem," the Shepherd cautioned, "not to have given heed to what
you have heard. Did not I bid you think?"
<p>"Yes, do I think, and I remember," I said, "and therefore give you thanks!"
<p>"If you did truly think thereon," said the Shepherd, "tell me: Why do
they merit death who are in ignorance?"
<p>"It is because the gloomy Darkness is the root and base of the material
frame; from it came the Watery Substance from which the body in the sense-world
is composed; and from this body of Death and Darkness does the Water drain."
<p>"Right is your thought," He said. "But how does 'he who knows himself,
go unto Him,' as God's Word had declared?"
<p>And I reply: "The Father of the universals consists of Light and Life,
and from Him, Man was born."
<p>"You are right! Light and Life is the Divine Mind, and from it Man was
born. If then you know that you are yourself of Life and Light, and that
you are made of them, you shall return to Life and Light." Thus did the
Shepherd speak.
<p>"But tell me further, Mind of me," I cried out, "How shall I come to
Life again, for God does say 'the man who had Mind in him, let him learn
to know that he himself is deathless.' Have not all men then Mind?"
<p>"Again you speak well! I, Divine Mind, myself am present with holy men
and good, the pure and merciful men who live piously. To such my presence
becomes an aid, and straightway they gain Gnosis of all things, and win
their Father's love by their pure lives, and give Him thanks, invoking
on Him blessings and entering his Kingdom, intent on Him with ardent love.
And before they give the body up unto its proper death, they turn from
their bodies with disgust from its sensations, from knowledge of what things
they operate. Nay, it is I, the Divine Mind, that will not let the operations
that befall the body work to their natural end. For being the gatekeeper,
I close up all the entrances, and bar the entrance of the base and evil
workings of the senses, cutting off all thoughts of them. But to the Mindless
ones, the wicked and depraved, the envious and covetous, and murderous
and impious, I keep far aloof, yielding my place to the Avenging Daimon,
who sharpening the fire, torments them and adds fire to fire upon them,
and rushes on them through their senses, thus rendering them the readier
for their transgressions of the law, so that they meet with greater torment.
Nor do they ever cease to have desire for their appetites inordinate, insatiably
striving in the Darkness."

<center><b><font size=+1>The Ascent of the Soul to the Eighth Sphere</font></b></center>

<p>"Full well have you taught me all, as I desired, 0h Divine Mind. And
now, " I beseeched Him, "pray tell me further of the nature of the way
to the Life Above."
<p>To this, the Shepherd replied: "When your material body is to be dissolved,
first you surrender the body by itself unto the work of Transformation,
and thus the form you had vanishes, and you surrender your way of life,
void of its energy, back to its own nature. The body's senses next pass
back into their sources, becoming separate, and resurrect as new energies;
and passion and desire too withdraw unto that nature that is void of reason.
And thus it is that man does speed his way thereafter upwards through the
Spheres."
<p>He continued: "To the first zone he gives the energy of growth and waning;
unto the second zone, the devices of evil now de-energized; unto the third,
the guile of the desires de-energized; unto the fourth, his domineering
arrogance, also de-energized; unto the fifth, unholy daring and the rashness
of audacity, de-energized; unto the sixth, striving for wealth by evil
means, deprived of its aggrandizement; and to the seventh zone, ensnaring
falsehood, de-energized. And then, with all the energizings of the Spheres
stripped from him, clothed in his proper Power, he comes to that nature
that belongs unto the Eighth, and there with Those-That-Are is the One
Mind. They who are there welcome his coming with joy; and he, made like
to them that sojourn there, does further hear the Powers who are above
the substance of the Eighth Sphere, singing their praise to God in a language
of their own. And then they, in a band, go to the Father's home; of their
own selves they make surrender of themselves to the Powers, and thus becoming
Powers themselves they are in God. This the good end for those who have
gained Gnosis -- to be made one with God."

<p>"Why should you then delay?" the Shepherd asked me. "Must it not be,
since you have received all, that you should point the way to the world,
that through you the race of mankind may by your God be saved?" And after
he said this, the Shepherd of Men mingled again with the Powers.
<p>But I, with thanks and blessings unto the Father of the universal Powers,
was now freed, full of the power the Shepherd had poured into me, and full
of what he had taught me about the nature of All and of the loftiest Vision.
And I inscribed in my memory the benefaction of the Divine Mind, and I
was exceedingly glad, for I was full with that for which I craved. My bodily
sleep had come to be my soul's wakefulness; and the closing of my eyes,
true vision; and my silence, pregnant with good; and my barrenness of speech,
a brood of holy thoughts. Becoming God-inspired, I attained the abode of
Truth."

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. O my Son, write this first Book, both for Humanity's sake, and for
Piety towards God.
<p>2. For there can be no Religion more true or just, than to know the
things that are; and to acknowledge thanks for all things, to him that
made them, which thing I shall not cease continually to do.
<p>3. What then should a man do, O Father, to lead his life well, seeing
there is nothing here true ?
<p>4. Be Pious and Religious, O my Son, for he that doth so, is the best
and highest Philosopher; and with- out Philosophy, it is impossible ever
to attain to the height and exactness of Piety or Religion.
<p>5. But he that shall learn and study the things that are, and how they
are ordered and governed, and by whom and for what cause, or to what end,
will acknowledge thanks to the Workman as to a good Father, an excellent
Nurse and a faithful Steward, and he that gives thanks shall be Pious or
Religious, and he that is Religious shall know both where the truth is,
and what it is, and learning that, he will be yet more and more Religious.
<p>6. For never, O Son, shall or can that Soul which while it is in the
Body lightens and lifts up itself to know and comprehend that which is
Good and True, slide back to the contrary; for it is infinitely enamoured
thereof. and forgetteth all Evils; and when it hath learned and known its
Father and progenitor it can no more Apostatize or depart from that Good.
<p>7. And let this, O Son, be the end of Religion and Piety; whereunto
when thou art once arrived, thou shalt both live well, and die blessedly,
whilst thy Soul is not ignorant whether it must return and fly back again.
<p>8. For this only, O Son, is the way to the Truth, which our Progenitors
travelled in; and by which, making their Journey, they at length attained
to the Good. It is a Venerable way, and plain, but hard and difficult for
the Soul to go in that is in the Body.
<p>9. For first must it war against its own self, and after much Strife
and Dissention it must be overcome of one part; for the Contention is of
one against two, whilst it flies away and they strive to hold and detain
it.
<p>10. But the victory of both is not like; for the one hasteth to that
which is Good, but the other is a neighbour to the things that are Evil;
and that which is Good, desireth to be set at Liberty; but the things that
are Evil, love Bondage and Slavery.
<p>11. And if the two parts be overcome, they become quiet, and are content
to accept of it as their Ruler; but if the one be overcome of the two,
it is by them led and carried to be punished by its being and continuance
here.
<p>12. This is, O Son, the Guide in the way that leads thither for thou
must first forsake the Body before thy end, and get the victory in this
Contention and Strifeful life, and when thou hast overcome. return.
<p>13. But now, O my Son, I will by Heads run through the things that are:
understand thou what I say, and remember what thou hearest.
<p>14. All things that are, are moved; only that which is not, is unmovable.
<p>15. Every Body is changeable.
<p>16. Not every Body is dissolvable.
<p>17. Some Bodies are dissolvable.
<p>18. Every living thing is not mortal.
<p>19. Not every living thing is immortal.
<p>20. That which may be dissolved is also corruptible.
<p>21. That which abides always is unchangeable.
<p>22. That which is unchangeable is eternal.
<p>23. That which is always made is always corrupted.
<p>24. That which is made but once, is never corrupted, neither becomes
any other thing.
<p>25. First, God; Secondly, the World; Thirdly, Man.
<p>26. The World for Man, Man for God.
<p>27. Of the Soul, that part which is Sensible is mortal, but that which
is Reasonable is immortal.
<p>28. Every essence is immortal.
<p>29. Every essence is unchangeable.
<p>30. Every thing that is, is double.
<p>31. None of the things that are stand still.
<p>32. Not all things are moved by a Soul, but every thing that is, is
moved by a Soul.
<p>33. Every thing that suffers is Sensible, every thing that is Sensible
suffereth.
<p>34. Every thing that is sad rejoiceth also, and is a mortal living Creature.
<p>35. Not every thing that joyeth is also sad, but is an eternal living
thing.
<p>36. Not every Body is sick; every Body that is sick is dissolvable.
<p>37. The Mind in God.
<p>38. Reasoning (or disputing or discoursing) in Man,
<p>39. Reason in the Mind.
<p>40. The Mind is void of suffering.
<p>41. No thing in a Body true.
<p>42. All that is incorporeal, is void of Lying.
<p>43. Every thing that is made is corruptible.
<p>44. Nothing good upon Earth, nothing evil in Heaven.
<p>45. God is good, Man is evil.
<p>46. Good is voluntary, or of its own accord.
<p>47. Evil is involuntary or against its will.
<p>48. The Gods choose good things, as good things.
<p>49. Time is a Divine thing.
<p>50. Law is Humane.
<p>51. Malice is the nourishment of the World.
<p>52. Time is the Corruption of Man.
<p>53. Whatsoever is in Heaven is unalterable.
<p>54. All upon Earth is alterable.
<p>55. Nothing in Heaven is servanted, nothing upon Earth free.
<p>56. Nothing unknown in Heaven, nothing known upon Earth.
<p>57. The things upon Earth communicate not with those in Heaven.
<p>58. All things in Heaven are unblameable, all things upon Earth are
subject to Reprehension.
<p>59. That which is immortal, is not mortal: that which is mortal is not
immortal.
<p>60. That which is sown, is not always begotten; but that which is begotten
always, is sown.
<p>61. Of a dissolvable Body, there are two Times, one from sowing to generation,
one from generation to
<p>death.
<p>62. Of an everlasting Body, the time is only from the Generation.
<p>63. Dissolvable Bodies are increased and diminished,
<p>64. Dissolvable matter is altered into contraries; to wit, Corruption
and Generation, but Eternal matter into its self, and its like.
<p>65. The Generation of Man is Corruption, the Corruption of Man is the
beginning of Generation.
<p>66. That which off-springs or begetteth another, is itself an offspring
or begotten by another.
<p>67. Of things that are, some are in Bodies, some in their Ideas.
<p>68. Whatsoever things belong to operation or working, are in a Body.
<p>69. That which is immortal, partakes not of that which is mortal.
<p>70. That which is mortal, cometh not into a Body immortal, but that
which is immortal, cometh into that which is mortal.
<p>71. Operations or Workings are not carried upwards, but descend downwards.
<p>72. Things upon Earth do nothing advantage those in Heaven, but all
things in Heaven do profit and advantage the things upon Earth.
<p>73. Heaven is capable and a fit receptacle of everlasting Bodies, the
Earth of corruptible Bodies.
<p>74. The Earth is brutish, the Heaven is reasonable or rational.
<p>75. Those things that are in Heaven are subjected or placed under it,
but the things on Earth, are placed upon it.
<p>76. Heaven is the first Element.
<p>77. Providence is Divine Order.
<p>78. Necessity is the Minister or Servant of Providence.
<p>79. Fortune is the carriage or effect of that which is without Order;
the Idol of operation, a lying fantasy or opinion.
<p>80. What is God? The immutable or unalterable Good.
<p>81. What is Man? An unchangeable Evil.
<p>82. If thou perfectly remember these Heads, thou canst not forget those
things which in more words I have largely expounded unto thee; for these
are the Contents or Abridgment of them.
<p>83. Avoid all Conversation with the multitude or common People, for
I would not have thee subject to Envy, much less to be ridiculous unto
the many.
<p>84. For the like always takes to itself that which is like, but the
unlike never agrees with the unlike: such Discourses as these have very
few Auditors, and peradventure very few will have, but they have something
peculiar unto themselves.
<p>85. They do rather sharpen and whet evil men to their maliciousness,
therefore it behoveth to avoid the multitude and take heed of them as not
understanding the virtue and power of the things that are said.
<p>86. How dost Thou mean, O Father?
<p>87. Thus, O Son, the whole Nature and Composition of those living things
called Men, is very prone to Maliciousness, and is very familiar, and as
it were nourished with it, and therefore is delighted with it. Now this
wight if it shall come to learn or know, that the world was once made,
and all things are done according to Providence and Necessity, Destiny,
or Fate, bearing Rule over all: Will he not be much worse than himself,
despising the whole because it was made. And if he may lay the cause of
evil upon Fate or Destiny, he will never abstain from any evil work.
<p>88. Wherefore we must look warily to such kind of people, that being
in ignorance, they may be less evil for fear of that which is hidden and
kept secret.

<p>1. My Thoughts being once seriously busied about the things that are,
and my Understanding lifted up, all my bodily Senses being exceedingly
holden back, as it is with them that are very heavy of sleep, by reason
either of fulness of meat, or of bodily labour. Me thought I saw one of
an exceeding great stature, and an infinite greatness call me by my name,
and say unto me, "What wouldest thou Hear and See? or what wouldest thou
Understand, to Learn, and Know!"
<p>2. Then said I, " Who art Thou?"
<p>"I am," quoth he, "Poemander, the mind of the Great Lord, the most Mighty
and absolute Emperor: I know what thou wouldest have, and I am always present
with thee."
<p>3. Then said I, "I would Learn the Things that art, and Understand the
Nature of them and know God."
<br>"How?" said he.
<p>I answered, "That I would gladly hear.''
<p>Then he, "Have me again in thy mind, and whatsoever thou wouldst learn,
I will teach thee."
<p>4. When he had thus said, he was changed in his Idea or Form and straightway
in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened unto me: and I saw an
infinite Sight, all things were become light, both sweet and exceedingly
pleasant; and I was wonderfully delighted in the beholding it.
<p>5. But after a little while, there was a darkness made in part, coming
down obliquely, fearful and hideous, which seemed unto me to be changed
into a Certain Moist Nature, unspeakably troubled, which yielded a smoke
as from fire; and from whence proceeded a voice unutterable, and very mournful,
but inarticulate, insomuch that it seemed to have come from the Light.
<p>6. Then from that Light, a certain Holy Word joined itself unto Nature,
and out flew the pure and unmixed Fire from the moist Nature upward on
high; it is exceeding Light, and Sharp, and Operative withal. And the Air
which was also light, followed the Spirit and mounted up to Fire (from
the Earth and the Water) insomuch that it seemed to hang and depend upon
it.
<p>7. And the Earth and the Water stayed by themselves so mingled together,
that the Earth could not be seen for the Water, but they were moved, because
of the Spiritual Word that was carried upon them.
<p>8. Then said Poemander unto me, "Dost thou understand this Vision, and
what it meaneth?"
<p>"I shall know," said I.
<p>Then said he, "I am that Light, the Mind, thy God, who am before that
Moist Nature that appeareth out of Darkness, and that Bright and Lightful
Word from the Mind is the Son of God."
<p>9. "How is that?" quoth I.
<p>"Thus," replied he, "Understand it, That which in thee Seeth and Heareth,
the Word of the Lord, and the Mind, the Father, God, Differeth not One
from the Other, and the Unison of these is Life."
<p>Trismegistus. "I thank thee."
<p>Pimander. "But first conceive well the Light in thy mind and know it."
<p>10. When he had thus said, for a long time me looked steadfastly one
upon the other, insomuch that I trembled at his Idea or Form.
<p>11. But when he nodded to me, I beheld in my mind the Light that is
in innumerable, and the truly indefinite Ornament or World; and that the
Fire is comprehended or contained in or by a most great Power, and constrained
to keep its station.
<p>12. These things I understood, seeing the word of Pimander; and when
I was mightily amazed, he said again unto me, "Hast thou seen in thy mind
that Archetypal Form, which was before the Interminated and Infinite Beginning?"
Thus Pimander to me.
<p>"But whence," quoth I, "or whereof are the Elements of Nature made?"
<p>Pimander : "Of the Will and Counsel of God; which taking the Word, and
beholding the beautiful World (in the Archetype thereof) imitated it, and
so made this World, by the principles and vital Seeds or Soul-like productions
of itself."
<p>13. For the Mind being God, Male and Female, Life and Light, brought
forth by his Word; another Mind, the Workman: Which being God of the Fire,
and the Spirit, fashioned and formed seven other Governors, which in their
Circles contain the Sensible World, whose Government or Disposition is
called Fate or Destiny.
<p>14. Straightway leaped out, or exalted itself front the downward born
Elements of God, the Word of God into the clean and pure Workmanship of
Nature, and was united to the Workman, Mind, for it was Consubstantial;
and so the downward born Elements of Nature were left without Reason, that
they might be the only Matter.
<p>15. But the Workman, Mind, together with the Word, containing the Circles
and Whirling them about, turned round as a Wheel his own Workmanships,
and suffered them to be turned from an indefinite Beginning to an undeterminable
End; for they always begin where they end.
<p>16. And the Circulation or running round of these, as the Mind willeth,
out of the lower or downward-born Elements brought forth unreasonable or
brutish creatures, for they had no reason, the Air flying things, and the
Water such as swim.
<p>17. And the Earth and the Water was separated, either from the other,
as the Mind would: and the Earth brought forth from herself such Living
Creatures as she had, four-footed and creeping Beasts, wild and tame.
<p>18. But the Father of all things, the Mind being Life and Light, brought
forth Man, like unto himself, whom he loved as his proper Birth, for he
was all beauteous, having the Image of his Father.
<p>19. For indeed God was exceedingly enamoured of his own Form or Shape,
and delivered unto it all his own Workmanships. But he seeing and understanding
the Creation of the Workman in the whole, would needs also himself Fall
to Work, and so was separated from the Father, being in the sphere of Generation
or operation.
<p>20. Having all Power, he considered the Operations or Workmanships of
the Seven; but they loved him, and every one made him partaker of his own
Order.
<p>21. And he learning diligently and understanding their Essence, and
partaking their nature, resolved to pierce and break through the Circumference
of the Circles, and to understand the Power of him that sits upon the Fire.
<p>22. And having already all power of mortal things, of the Living, and
of the unreasonable Creatures of the World, stooped down and peeped through
the Harmony, and breaking through the strength of the Circles, so shewed
and made manifest the downward-born Nature, the fair and beautiful Shape
or Form of God.
<p>23. Which when he saw, having in itself the unsatiable Beauty and all
the Operation of the Seven Governors, and the Form or Shape of God, he
Smiled for love, as if he had seen the Shape or Likeness in the Water,
or the shadow upon the Earth of the fairest Human form.
<p>24. And seeing in the Water a shape, a shape like unto himself in himself
he loved it, and would cohabit with it; and immediately upon the resolution,
ensued the Operation, and brought forth the unreasonable Image or Shape.
<p>25. Nature presently laying hold of what it so much loved, did wholly
wrap herself about it, and they were mingled, for they loved one another.
<p>26. And for this cause, Man above all things that live upon Earth, is
double; Mortal because of his Body, and Immortal because of the substantial
Man: For being immortal, and having power of all things, he yet suffers
mortal things, and such as are subject to Fate or Destiny.
<p>27. And therefore being; above all Harmony, he is made and become a
servant to Harmony. And being Hermaphrodite, or Male and Female, and watchful,
he is governed by and subjected to a Father, that is both Male and Female
and watchful.
<p>28. After these things, I said: "Thou art my Mind and I am in love with
Reason."
<p>29. Then said Pimander, "This is the Mystery that to this day is hidden,
and kept secret; for Nature being mingled with Man brought forth a Wonder
most wonderful; for he having the Nature of the Harmony of the Seven, from
him whom I told thee, the Fire and the Spirit, Nature continued not, but
forth with brought forth seven Men all Males and Females and sublime, or
on high, according to the Natures of the Seven Governors."
<p>30. "And after these things, O Pimander," quoth I, "I am now come into
a great desire, and longing to hear, do not digress, or run out."
<p>31. But he said, "Keep silence, for I have not yet finished the first
speech."
<p>32. Trismegistus. "Behold, I am silent."
<p>33. Pimander. "The Generation therefore of these Seven was after this
manner, the Air being Feminine and the Water desirous of Copulation, took
from the Fire its ripeness, and from the aether Spirit; and so Nature produced
bodies after the Species and Shape of men."
<p>34. And Man was made of Life and Light into Soul and Mind, of Life the
Soul, of Light the Mind.
<p>35. And so all the Members of the Sensible World, continued unto the
period of the end, bearing rule, and generating.
<p>36. Hear now the rest of that speech, thou so much desirest to hear.
<p>37. When that Period was fulfilled, the bond of all things was loosed
and untied by the Will of God; for all living Creatures being Hermaphroditical,
or Male and Female, were loosed and untied together with Man; and so the
Males were apart by themselves and the Females likewise.
<p>38. And straightway God said to the Holy Word,. Increase in Increasing,
and Multiply in Multitude all you my Creatures and Workmanships. And let
Him that is endued with Mind, know Himself to be Immortal; and that the
cause of Death is the Love of the Body, and let Him Learn all Things that
are.
<p>39. When he had thus said, Providence by Fate and Harmony, made the
mixtures, and established the Generations, and all things were multiplied
according to their kind, and he that knew himself, came at length to the
Superstantial of every way substantial good.
<p>40. But he that through the Error of Love, loved the Body, abideth wandering
in darkness, sensible, suffering the things of death.
<p>41. Trismegistus. "But why do they that are ignorant sin so much, that
they should therefore be deprived of immortality."
<p>42. Pimander. "Thou seemest not to have understood what thou hast heard."
<p>43. Trismegistus. "Peradventure I seem so to thee, but I both understand
and remember them."
<p>44. Pimander. "I am glad for thy sake, if thou understoodest them."
<p>45. Trismegistus. "Tell me, why are they worthy of death, that are in
death?"
<p>46. Pimander. "Because there goeth a sad and dismal darkness before
its Body; of which darkness is the moist Nature, of which moist Nature,
the Body consisteth in the sensible World, from whence death is derived.
Hast thou understood this aright!"
<p>47. Trismegistus. "But why or how doth he that understands himself,
go or pass into God!"
<p>48. Pimander. "That which the Word of God said, say I: Because the Father
of all things consists of Life and Light, whereof Man is made."
<p>49. Trismegistus. "Thou sayest very well."
<p>50. Pimander. "God and the Father is Light and Life, of which Man is
made. If therefore thou learn and believe thyself to be of the Life and
Light, thou shalt again pass into Life."
<p>51. Trismegistus. "But yet tell me more, O my Mind, how I shall go into
Life."
<p>52. Pimander. "God saith, Let the Man endued with a Mind, mark, consider,
and know himself well."
<p>53. Trismegistus. "Have not all Men a mind?"
<p>54. Pimander. "Take heed what thou sayest, for I the Mind come unto
men that are holy and good, pure and merciful, and that live piously and
religiously; and my presence is a help unto them. And forthwith they know
all things, and lovingly they supplicate and propitiate the Father; and
blessing him, they give him thanks, and sing hymns unto him, being ordered
and directed by filial Affection, and natural Love: And before they give
up their Bodies to the death of them, they hate their Senses, knowing their
Works and Operations.
<p>55. "Rather I that am the Mind itself, will not suffer the Operations
or Works, which happen or belong to the body, to be finished and brought
to perfection in them; but being the Porter and Door-keeper, I will shut
up the entrances of Evil, and cut off the thoughtful desires of filthy
works.
<p>56. "But to the foolish, and evil, and wicked, and envious and covetous,
and murderous, and profane, I am far off giving place to the avenging Demon,
which applying unto him the sharpness of fire, tormenteth such a man sensibly,
and armeth him the more to all wickedness, that he may obtain the greater
punishment.
<p>57. "And such a one never ceaseth, having unfulfillable desires and
unsatiable concupiscences, and always fighting in darkness for the Demon
afflicts and tormenteth him continually, and increaseth the fire upon him
more and more."
<p>58. Trismegistus. "Thou hast, O Mind, most excellently taught me all
things, as I desired; but tell me moreover, after the return is made, what
then?"
<p>59. Pimander. "First of all, in the resolution of the material Body,
the Body itself is given up to alteration, and the form which it had, becometh
invisible; and the idle manners are permitted, and left to the Demon, and
the Senses of the Body return into their Fountains, being parts, and again
made up into Operations.
<p>60. "And Anger and Concupiscence go into the brutish or unreasonable
Nature; and the rest striveth upward by Harmony.
<p>61. "And to the first Zone it giveth the power it had of increasing
and diminishing.
<p>62. "To the second, the machination or plotting of evils, and one effectual
deceit or craft.
<p>63. "To the third, the idle deceit of Concupiscence.
<p>64. "To the fourth, the desire of Rule, and unsatiable Ambition.
<p>65. "To the fifth, profane Boldness, and headlong rashness of Confidence.
<p>66. "To the sixth, Evil and ineffectual occasions of Riches.
<p>67. "And to the seventh Zone, subtle Falsehood always lying in wait.
<p>68. "And then being made naked of all the Operations of Harmony it cometh
to the eighth Nature, having its proper power, and singeth praises to the
Father with the things that are, and all they that are present rejoice,
and congratulate the coming of it; and being made like to them with whom
it converseth, it heareth also the Powers that are above the eighth Nature,
singing praise to God in a certain voice that is peculiar to them.
<p>69. "And then in order they return unto the Father, and themselves deliver
themselves to the powers, and becoming powers they are in God.
<p>70. "This is the Good, and to them that know to be deified.
<p>71. "Furthermore, why sayest thou, What resteth, but that understanding
all men, thou become a guide, and way-leader to them that are worthy; that
the kind of Humanity or Mankind, may be saved by God!"
<p>72. When Pimander had thus said unto me, he was mingled among the Powers.
<p>73. But I giving thanks, and blessing the Father of all things, rose
up, being enabled by him, and taught the Nature, of the Nature of the whole
and having seen the greatest sight or spectacle.
<p>74. And I began to Preach unto men, the beauty and fairness of Piety
and Knowledge.
<p>75. O ye People, Men, born and made of the Earth, which have given Yourselves
over to Drunkenness, and Sleep, and to the Ignorance of God, be Sober,
and Cease your Surfeit, whereto you are allured, and invited by Brutish
and Unreasonable Sleep.
<p>76. And they that heard me, come willingly, and with one accord, and
then I said further.
<p>77. Why, O Men of the Off-spring of the Earth, why have you delivered
Yourselves over unto Death, having Power to Partake of Immortality; Repent
and Change your Minds, you that have together Walked in Error, and have
been Darkened in Ignorance.
<p>78. Depart from that dark Light, be Partakers of Immortality, and Leave
or Forsake Corruption.
<p>79. And some of Them That Heard Me, mocking and scorning, went away
and delivered themselves up to the way of death.
<p>80. But others, casting themselves down before my feet, besought me
that they might be taught; but I causing them to rise up, became a guide
of mankind, teaching them the reasons how, and by what means they may be
saved. And I sowed in them the words of Wisdom, and nourished them with
Ambrosian Water of Immortality.
<p>81. And when it was Evening, and the Brightness of the same began wholly
to go down, I commanded them to give thanks to God; and when they had finished
their thanksgiving, everyone returned to his own lodging.
<p>82. But I wrote in myself the bounty and beneficence of Pimander; and
being filled with what I most desired, I was exceeding glad.
<p>83. For the sleep of the Body was the sober watchfulness of the mind;
and the shutting of my eyes the true Sight, and my silence great with child
and full of good; and the pronouncing of my words, the blossoms and fruits
of good things.
<p>84. And thus came to pass or happened unto me, which I received from
my mind, that is, Pimander, the Lord of the Word; whereby I became inspired
by God with the Truth.
<p>85. For which cause, with my Soul, and whole strength, I give praise
and blessing unto God the Father.
<p>86. Holy is God the Father of All Things.
<p>87. Holy is God Whose Will is Performed and Accomplished by His Own
Powers.
<p>88. Holy is God, that Determineth to be Known, and is Known of His Own,
or Those that are His.
<p>89. Holy art Thou, that by Thy Word hast established all Things.
<p>90. Holy art Thou of Whom all Nature is the Image.
<p>91. Holy art Thou Whom Nature hath not Formed.
<p>92. Holy art Thou that art Stronger than all Power.
<p>93. Holy art Thou, that art Greater than all Excellency.
<p>94. Holy art Thou, Who art Better than all Praise.
<p>95. Accept these Reasonable Sacrifices from a Pure Soul, and a Heart
stretched out unto Thee.
<p>96. O Thou Unspeakable, Unutterable, to be Praised with Silence!
<p>97. I beseech Thee, that I may never Err from the Knowledge of Thee,
Look Mercifully upon Me, and Enable Me, and Enlighten with this Grace,
those that .are in Ignorance, the Brothers of my Kind, but Thy Sons.
<p>98. Therefore I Believe Thee, and Bear Witness, and go into the Life
and Light.
<p>98. Blessed art Thou, O Father, Thy Man would be Sanctified with Thee,
as Thou hast given Him all Power.

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The glory of all things, God and that which is Divine, and the Divine
Nature, the beginning of things that are.
<p>2. God, and the Mind, and Nature, and Matter, and Operation, or Working
and Necessity, and the End and Renovation.
<p>3. For there were in the Chaos, an infinite darkness in the Abyss or
bottomless Depth, and Water, and a subtle Spirit intelligible in Power;
and there went out the Holy Light, and the Elements were coagulated from
the Sand out of the moist Substance.
<p>4. And all the Gods distinguished the Nature full of Seeds.
<p>5. And when all things were interminated and unmade up, the light things
were divided on high. And the heavy things were founded upon the moist
sand, all things being Terminated or Divided by Fire; and being sustained
or hung up by the Spirit they were so carried, and the Heaven was seen
in Seven Circles.
<p>6. And the Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars, with all their
Signs, and the Stars were numbered, with the Gods in them. And the Sphere
was all lined with Air, carried about in a circular, motion by the Spirit
of God.
<p>7. And every God by his internal power, did that which was commanded
him; and there were made four footed things, and creeping things, and such
as live in the Water, and such as fly, and every fruitful Seed, and Grass,
and the Flowers of all Greens, and which had sowed in themselves the Seeds
of Regeneration.
<p>8. As also the Generations of men to the knowledge of the Divine Works,
and a lively or working Testimony of Nature, and a multitude of men, and
the Dominion of all things under Heaven and the knowledge of good things,
and to be increased in increasing, and multiplied in multitude.
<p>9. And every Soul in flesh, by the wonderful working of the Gods in
the Circles, to the beholding of Heaven, the Gods, Divine Works, and the
Operations of Nature; and for Signs of good things, and the knowledge of
the Divine Power, and to find out every cunning workmanship of good things.
<p>10. So it beginneth to live in them, and to be wise according to the
Operation of the course of the circular Gods; and to be resolved into that
which shall be great Monuments; and Remembrances of the cunning Works done
upon Earth, leaving them to be read by the darkness of times.
<p>11. And every generation of living flesh, of Fruit, Seed, and all Handicrafts,
though they be lost, must of necessity be renewed by the renovation of
the Gods, and of the Nature of a Circle, moving in number; for it is a
Divine thing, that every world temperature should be renewed by nature,
for in that which is Divine, is Nature also established.

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Yesterday's Speech, O Asclepius, I dedicated to thee, this day's
it is fit to dedicate to Tat, because it is an Epitome of those general
speeches that were spoken to him.
<p>2. God therefore, and the Father, and the Good, O Tat, have the same
Nature, or rather also the same Act and Operation.
<p>3. For there is one name or appellation of Nature and Increase which
concerneth things changeable, and another about things unchangeable, and
about things unmoveable, that is to say, Things Divine and Human; every
one of which, himself will have so to be; but action or operation is of
another thing, or elsewhere, as we have taught in other things, Divine
and Human, which must here also be understood.
<p>4. For his Operation or Act, is his Will, and his Essence, to Will all
Things to be.
<p>5. For what is God, and the Father, and the Good, but the Being of all
things that yet are not, and the existence itself, of those things that
are!
<p>6. This is God, this is the Father, this is the Good, whereunto no other
thing is present or approacheth.
<p>7. For the World, and the Sun, which is also a Father by Participation,
is not for all that equally the cause of Good, and of Life, to living Creatures:
And if this be so, he is altogether constrained by the Will of the Good,
without which it is not possible, either to be, or to be begotten or made.
<p>8. But the Father is the cause of his Children, who hath a will both
to sow and nourish that which is good by the Son.
<p>9. For Good is always active or busy in making; and this cannot he in
any other, but in him that taketh nothing, and yet willeth all things to
be; for I will not say, O Tat, making them; for he that maketh is defective
in much time, in which sometimes he maketh not, as also of quantity and
quality; for sometimes he maketh those things that have quantity and quality
and sometimes the contrary.
<p>10. But God is the Father, and the Good, in being all things; for he
both will be this, and is it, and yet all this for himself(as is true)
in him that can see it.
<p>11. For all things else are for this, it is the property of Good to
be known: This is the Good, O Tat.
<p>12. Tat. --- Thou hast filled us, O Father, with a sight both good and
fair, and the eye of my mind is almost become more holy by the sight or
spectacle.
<p>13. Trismegistus. --- I Wonder not at It, for the Sight of Good is not
like the Beam of the Sun, which being of a fiery shining brightness, maketh
the eye blind by his excessive Light, that gazeth upon it; rather the contrary,
for it enlighteneth, and so much increaseth the light of the eye, as any
man is able to receive the influence of this Intelligible clearness.
<p>14. For it is more swift and sharp to pierce, and innocent or harmless
withal, and full of immortality, and they that are capable and can draw
any store of this spectacle, and sight do many times fall asleep from the
Body, into this most fair and beauteous Vision ; which thing Celius and
Saturn our Progenitors obtained unto.
<p>15. Tat. --- I would we also, O Father, could do so.
<p>16. Trismegistus. --- I would have could, O Son; but for the present
we are less intent to the Vision, and cannot yet open the eyes of our minds
to behold the incorruptible, and incomprehensible Beauty of that Good:
But then shall we see it, when we have nothing at all to say of it.
<p>17. For the knowledge of it, is a Divine Silence, and the rest of all
the Senses; For neither can he that understands that understand anything
else, nor he that sees that, see any thing else, nor hear any other thing,
nor in sum, move the Body.
<p>18. For shining steadfastly upon, and round about the whole Mind it
enlighteneth all the Soul ; and loosing it from the Bodily Senses and Motions,
it draweth it from the Body, and changeth it wholly into the Essence of
God.
<p>19. For it is Possible for the Soul, O Son, to be Deified while yet
it Lodgeth in the Body of Man, if it Contemplate the Beauty of the Good.
<p>20. Tat. --- How dost thou mean deifying, Father!
<p>21. Trismegistus. --- There are differences, O Son, of every Soul.
<p>22. Tat. --- But how dost thou again divide the changes?
<p>23. Trismegistus. --- Hast thou not heard in the general Speeches, that
from one Soul of the Universe, are all those Souls, which in all the world
are tossed up and down, as it were, and severally divided? Of these Souls
there are many changes, some into a more fortunate estate, and some quite
contrary; for they which are of creeping things, are changed into those
of watery things and those of things living in the water, to those of things
living upon the Land; and Airy ones are changed into men, and human Souls,
that lay hold of immortality, are changed into Demons.
<p>24. And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods, for
there are two choirs or companies of Gods, one of them that wander, and
another of them that are fixed. And this is the most perfect glory of the
Soul.
<p>25. But the Soul entering into the Body of a Man, if it continue evil,
shall neither taste of immortality, nor is partaker of the good.
<p>26. But being drawn back the same way, it returneth into creeping things.
And this is the condemnation of an evil Soul.
<p>27. And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance; for the Soul that knows
nothing of the things that are, neither the Nature of them, nor that which
is good, but is blinded, rusheth and dasheth against the bodily Passions,
and unhappy as it is, not knowing itself, it serveth strange Bodies, and
evil ones, carrying the Body as a burthen, and not ruling, but ruled. And
this is the mischief of the Soul.
<p>28. On the contrary, the virtue of the Soul is Knowledge; for he that
knows is both good and religious, and already Divine.
<p>29. Tat. --- But who is such a one, O Father!
<p>30. Trismegistus. --- He that neither speaks, nor hears many things;
for he, O Son, that heareth two speeches or hearings, fighteth in the shadow.
<p>31. For God, and the Father, and Good, is neither spoken nor heard.
<p>32. This being so in all things that are, are the Senses, because they
cannot be without them.
<p>33. But Knowledge differs much from Sense; for Sense is of things that
surmount it, but Knowledge is the end of Sense.
<p>34. Knowledge is the gift of God ; for all Knowledge is unbodily but
useth the Mind as an Instrument, as the Mind useth the Body.
<p>35. Therefore both intelligible and material things go both of them
into bodies; for, of contraposition, That is Setting One against Another,
and Contrariety, all Things must Consist. And it is impossible it should
be otherwise,
<p>36. Tat. --- Who therefore is this material God?
<p>37. Trismegistus. --- The fair and beautiful world, and yet it is not
good; for it is material and easily passible, nay, it is the first of all
passible things; and the second of the things that are, and needy or wanting
somewhat else. And it was once made and is always, and is ever in generation,
and made, and continually makes, or generates things that have quantity
and quality.
<p>38. For it is moveable, and every material motion is generation; but
the intellectual stability moves the material motion after this manner.
<p>39. Because the World Is a Sphere, that is a Head, and above the head
there is nothing material, as beneath the feet there is nothing intellectual.
<p>40. The whole universe is material; The Mind is the head, and it is
moved spherically, that is like a head.
<p>41. Whatsoever therefore is joined or united to the Membrane or Film
of this head, wherein the Soul is, is immortal, and as in the Soul of a
made Body, hath its Soul full of the Body; but those that are further from
that Membrane, have the Body full of Soul.
<p>42. The whole is a living wight, and therefore consisteth of material
and intellectual.
<p>43. And the World is the first, and Man the second living wight after
the World; but the first of things that are mortal and therefore hath whatsoever
benefit of the Soul all the others have: And yet for all this, he is not
only not good, but flatly evil, as being mortal.
<p>44. For the World is not good as it is moveable; nor evil as it is immortal.
<p>45. But man is evil, both as he is moveable, and as he is mortal.
<p>46. But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner, The Mind is in Reason,
Reason in the Soul, the Soul in the Spirit, the Spirit in the Body.
<p>47. The Spirit being diffused and going through the veins, and arteries,
and blood, both moveth the living Creature, and after a certain manner
beareth it.
<p>48. Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood, being deceived
in Nature, not knowing that first the Spirit must return into the Soul,
and then the blood is congealed, the veins and arteries emptied, and then
the living thing dieth: And this is the death of the Body.
<p>49. All things depend of one beginning, and- the beginning depends of
that which is one and alone.
<p>50. And the beginning is moved, that it may again be a beginning; but
that which is one, standeth and abideth, and is not moved,
<p>51. There are therefore these three, God the Father, and the Good, the
World and Man: God hath the World, and the World hath Man; and the World
is the Son of God, and Man as it were the Offspring of the World.
<p>52. For God is not ignorant of R/Ian, but knows him perfectly, and will
be known by him. This only is healthful to man; the Knowledge of God: this
is the return of Olympus; by this only the Soul is made good, and not sometimes
good, and sometimes evil, but of necessity Good.
<p>53. Tat. --- What meanest thou, O Father.
<p>54. Trismegistus. --- Consider, O Son, the Soul of a Child, when as
yet it hath received no dissolution of its Body, which is not yet grown,
but is very small; how then if it look upon itself, it sees itself beautiful,
as not having been yet spotted with the Passions of the Body, but as it
were depending yet upon the Soul of the World.
<p>55. But when the Body is grown and distracteth, the Soul it engenders
Forgetfulness, and partakes no more of the Fair and the Good, and Forgetfulness
is Evilness.
<p>56. The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Body: for when
the Soul runs back into itself the Spirit is contracted into the blood
and the Soul into the Spirit; but the Mind being made pure, and free from
these clothings; and being Divine by Nature, taking a fiery Body rangeth
abroad in every place, leaving the Soul to judgment, and to the punishment
it hath deserved.
<p>57. Tat. --- Why dost thou say so, O Father, that the Mind is separated
from the Soul, and the Soul from the Spirit? When even now thou saidst
the Soul was the Clothing or Apparel of the Mind, and the Body of the Soul.
<p>58. Trismegistus. --- O Son, he that hears must co-understand and conspire
in thought with him that speaks; yea, he must have his hearing swifter
and sharper than the voice of the speaker.
<p>59. The disposition of these Clothings or Covers, is done in an Earthly
Body; for it is impossible, that the mind should establish or rest itself,
naked, and of itself; in an Earthly Body; neither is the Earthly Body able
to bear such immortality; and therefore that it might suffer so great virtue
the Mind compacted as it were, and took to itself the passible Body of
the Soul, as a Covering or Clothing. And the Soul being also in some sort
Divine, useth the Spirit as her Minister and Servant, and the Spirit governeth
the living thing.
<p>60. When therefore the Mind is separated, and departeth from the earthly
Body, presently it puts on its Fiery Coat, which it could not do having
to dwell in an Earthly Body.
<p>61. For the Earth cannot suffer fire, for it is all burned of a small
spark; therefore is the water poured round about the Earth, as a Wall or
defence, to withstand the flame of fire.
<p>62. But the Mind being the most sharp or swift of all the Divine Cogitations,
and more swift than all the Elements, hath the fire for its Body.
<p>63. For the Mind which is the Workman of all useth the fire as his instrument
in his Workmanship; and he that is the Workman of all, useth it to the
making of all things, as it is used by man, to the making of Earthly things
only; for the Mind that is upon Earth, void, or naked of fire, cannot do
the business of men. nor that which is otherwise the affairs of God.
<p>64. But the Soul of Man, and yet not everyone, but that which is pious
and religious, is Angelical and Divine. And such a Soul, after it is departed
from the Body, having striven the strife of Piety, becomes either Mind
or God.
<p>65. And the strife of Piety is to know God, and to injure no Man, and
this way it becomes Mind.
<p>66. But an impious Soul abideth in its own essence, punished of itself,
and seeking an earthly and human Body to enter into.
<p>67. For no other Body is capable of a Human Soul, neither is it lawful
for a Man's Soul to fall into the Body of an unreasonable living thing:
for it is the Law or Decree of God, to preserve a Human Soul from so great
a contumely and reproach.
<p>68. Tat. --- How then is the Soul of Man punished, O Father; and what
is its greatest torment.
<p>69. Trismegistus. --- Impiety, O my Son; for what Fire hath so great
a flame as it? Or what biting Beast doth so tear the Body as it doth the
Soul.
<p>70. Or dost thou not see how many evils the wicked Soul suffereth, roaring
and crying out, I am Burned, I am Consumed, I know not what to Say, or
Do, I am Devoured, Unhappy Wretch, of the Evils that compass and lay-hold
upon me; Miserable that I am, I neither See nor Hear anything.
<p>71. These are the voices of a punished and tormented Soul, and not as
many; and thou, O Son, thinkest that the Soul going out of the Body grows
brutish or enters into a Beast: which is a very great Error, for the Soul
punished after this manner.
<p>72. For the Mind, when it is ordered or appointed to get a fiery Body
for the services of God, coming down into the wicked Soul, torments it
with the whips of Sins, wherewith the wicked Soul being scourged, turns
itself to Murders, and Contumelies, and Blasphemies, and divers Violences,
and other things by which men are injured
<p>73. But into a pious Soul, the Mind entering, leads it into the Light
of Knowledge.
<p>74. And such a Soul is never satisfied with singing praise to God, and
speaking well of all men; and both in words and deeds, always doing good
in imitation of her Father.
<p>75. Therefore, O Son, we must give thanks, and pray, that we may obtain
a good mind.
<p>76. The Soul therefore may be altered or changed into the better, but
into the worse it is impossible.
<p>77. But there is a communion of Souls, and those of Gods, communicate
with those of men; and those of men, with those of Beasts.
<p>78. And the better always take of the worse, Gods of Men, Men of brute
Beasts, but God of all: For he is the best of all, and all things are less
than he.
<p>79. Therefore is the World subject unto God, Man unto the World and
unreasonable things to Man.
<p>80. But God is above all, and about all; and the beams of God are operations;
and the beams of the World are Natures; and the beams of Man are Arts and
Sciences.
<p>81. And Operations do act by the World, and upon man by the natural
beams of the World, but Natures work by the Elements, and man by Arts and
Sciences.
<p>82. And this is the Government of the whole, depending upon the Nature
of the One, and piercing or coming down by the One Mind, than which nothing
is more Divine, and more efficacious or operative; and nothing more uniting,
or nothing is more One. The Communion of Gods to Men, and of Men to God.
<p>83. This is the Bonus Genius, or good Demon, blessed Soul that is fullest
of it! and unhappy Soul that is empty of it!
<p>84. Tat. --- And wherefore Father?
<p>85. Trismegistus. --- Know Son, that every Soul hath the Good Mind;
for of that it is we now speak, and not of that Minister of which we said
before, That he was sent from the Judgment.
<p>86. For the Soul without the Mind, can neither do, nor say any thing;
for many times the Mind flies away from the Soul, and in that hour the
Soul neither seeth nor heareth, but is like an unreasonable thing; so great
is the power of the Mind.
<p>87. But neither brooketh it an idle or lazy Soul, but leaves such a
one fastened to the Body, and by it pressed down.
<p>88. And such a Soul, O Son, hath no mind, wherefore neither must such
a one be called a Man.
<p>89. For man is a Divine living thing and is not to be compared to any
brute Beast that lives upon Earth, but to them that are above in Heaven,
that are called Gods.
<p>90. Rather, if we shall be bold to speak the truth, he that is a man
indeed, is above them, or at least they are equal in power, one to the
other, For none of the things in Heaven will come down upon Earth, and
leave the limits of Heaven, but a man ascends up into Heaven, and measures
it.
<p>91. And he knoweth what things are on high, and what below, and learneth
all other things exactly.
<p>92. And that which is the greatest of all, he leaveth not the Earth,
and yet is above: So great is the greatness of his Nature.
<p>93. Wherefore we must be bold to say, That an Earthly Man is a Mortal
God, and That the Heavenly God is an Immortal Man.
<p>94. Wherefore, by these two are all things governed, the World and Man;
but they and all things else, of that which is One.

<p><b><font size=+1>"That God is not Manifest and yet most Manifest."</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. This Discourse I will also make to thee, O Tat, that thou mayest
not be ignorant of the more excellent Name of God.
<p>2. But do thou contemplate in thy Mind, how that which to many seems
hidden and unmanifest, may be most manifest unto thee.
<p>3. For it were not all, if it were apparent, for whatsoever is apparent,
is generated or made; for it was made manifest, but that which is not manifest
is ever.
<p>4. For it needeth not to be manifested, for it is always.
<p>5. And he maketh all other things manifest, being unmanifest as being
always, and making other things manifest, he is not made manifest.
<p>9. Himself is not made, yet in fantasy he fantasieth all things, or
in appearance he maketh them appear, for appearance is only of those things
that are generated or made, for appearance is nothing but generation.
<p>7. But he is that One, that is not made nor generated, is also unapparent
and unmanifest.
<p>8. But making all things appear, he appeareth in all and by all; but
especially he is manifested to or in those things wherein himself listeth.
<p>9. Thou therefore, O Tat, my Son, pray first to the Lord and Father,
and to the Alone and to the One from whom is one to be merciful to thee,
that thou mayest knowest and understand so great a God; and that he would
shine one of his beams upon thee In thy understanding.
<p>10. For only the Understanding sees that which is not manifest or apparent,
as being itself not manifest or apparent; and if thou canst, O Tat, it
will appear to the eyes of thy Mind.
<p>11. For the Lord, void of envy, appeareth through the whole world. Thou
mayest see the intelligence, and take it in thy hands, and contemplate
the Image of God.
<p>12. But if that which is in thee, be not known or apparent unto thee,
how shall he in thee be seen, and appear unto thee by the eyes?
<p>13. But if thou wilt see him, consider and understand the Sun, consider
the course of the Moon, consider the order of the Stars.
<p>14. Who is he that keepeth order? for all order is circumscribed or
terminated in number and place.
<p>15. The Sun is the greatest of the Gods in heaven, to whom all the heavenly
Gods give place, as to a King and potentate; and yet he being such a one,
greater than the Earth or the Sea, is content to suffer infinite lesser
stars to walk and move above himself; whom doth he fear the while, O Son?
<p>16. Every one of these Stars that are in Heaven, do not make the like,
or an equal course; who is it that hath prescribed unto every one, the
manner and the greatness of their course!
<p>17. This Bear that turns round about its own self; and carries round
the whole World with her, who possessed and made such an Instrument.
<p>18. Who hath set the Bounds to the Sea? who hath established the Earth?
for there is some body, O Tat, that is the Maker and Lord of these things.
<p>19. For it is impossible, O Son, that either place, or number, or measure,
should be observed without a Maker.
<p>20. For no order can be made by disorder or disproportion.
<p>21. I would it were possible for thee, O my Son, to have wings, and
to fly into the Air, and being taken up in the midst, between Heaven and
Earth, to see the stability of the Earth, the fluidness of the Sea, the
courses of the Rivers, the largeness of the Air, the sharpness or swiftness
of the Fire, the motion of the Stars; and the speediness of the Heaven,
by which it goeth round about all these.
<p>22. O Son, what a happy sight it were, at one instant, to see all these,
that which is unmovable moved, and that which is hidden appear and be manifest.
<p>23. And if thou wilt see and behold this Workman, even by mortal things
that are upon Earth, and in the deep. Consider, O Son, how Man is made
and framed in the Womb; and examine diligently the skill and cunning of
the Workman, and learn who it was that wrought and fashioned the beautiful
and Divine shape of Man; who circumscribed and marked out his eyes? who
bored his nostrils and ears? who opened his mouth? who stretched out and
tied together his sinews! who channelled the veins? who hardened and made
strong the bones! who clothed the flesh with skin? who divided the fingers
and the joints! who flatted and made broad the soles of the feet! who digged
the pores! who stretched out the spleen, who made the heart like a Pyramis?
who made the Liver broad! who made the Lights spungy, and full of holes!
who made the belly large and capacious? who set to outward view the more
honourable parts and hid the filthy ones.
<p>24. See how many Arts in one Matter, and how many Works in one Superscription,
and all exceedingly beautiful, and all done in measure, and yet all differing.
<p>25. Who hath made all these things! what Mother! what Father! save only
God that is not manifest! that made all things by his own Will.
<p>26;: And no man says that a statue or an image is made without a Carver
or a Painter, and was this Workmanship made without a Workman? O great
Blindness, O great Impiety, O great Ignorance.
<p>27. Never, O Son Tat, canst thou deprive the Workmanship of the Workman,
rather it is the best Name of all the Names of God, to call him the Father
of all, for so he is alone; and this is his Work to be the Father.
<p>28. And if thou wilt force me to say anything more boldly, it is his
Essence to be pregnant, or great with all things, and to make them.
<p>29. And as without a Maker, it is impossible that anything should be
made, so it is that he should not always be, and always be making all things
in Heaven, in the Air, in the Earth, in the Deep, in the whole World, and
in every part of the whole that is, or that is not.
<p>30. For there is nothing in the whole World, that is not himself both
the things that are and the things that are not.
<p>31. For the things that are, he hath made manifest; and the things that
are not, he hath hid in himself.
<p>32. This is God that is better than any name; this is he that is secret;
this is he that is most manifest; this is he that is to be seen by the
Mind ; this is he that is visible to the eye; this is he that hath no body;
and this is he that hath many bodies, rather there is nothing of any body,
which is not He.
<p>33. For he alone is all things.
<p>34. And for this cause He hath all Names, because He is the One Father;
and therefore He hath no Name, because He is the Father of all.
<p>35. Who therefore can bless thee, or give thanks for thee, or to thee.
<p>36. Which way shall I look, when I praise thee? upward? downward? outward?
inward?
<p>37. For about thee there is no manner, nor place, nor anything else
of all things that are.
<p>38. But all things are in thee; all things from thee, thou givest all
things, and takest nothing; for thou hast all things and there is nothing
that thou hast not.
<p>39. When shall I praise thee, O Father; for it is neither possible to
comprehend thy hour, nor thy time?
<p>40. For what shall I praise thee? for what thou hast made, or for what
thou hast not made! fur those things thou hast manifested, or for those
things thou hast hidden?
<p>41. Wherefore shall I praise thee as being of myself, or having anything
of mine own, or rather being another's?
<p>42. For thou art what I am, thou art what I do, thou art what I say.
<p>43. Thou Art All Things, and there is Nothing Else Thou art not.
<p>44. Thou Art Thou, All that is Made, and all that is not Made.
<p>45. The Mind that Understandeth.
<p>46. The Father that Maketh and Frameth.
<p>47. The Good that Worketh.
<p>48. The Good that doth All Things.
<p>49. Of the Matter, the most subtle and slender part is Air, of the Air
the Soul, of the Soul the Mind, of the Mind God.

<center><b><font size=+1>The Sixth Book.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>called</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>"That in God Alone is Good."</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Good, O Asciepius, is in nothing but in God alone; or rather God
himself is the Good always.
<p>2. And if it be so, then must he be an Essence or Substance void of
all motion and generation; but nothing is void or empty of him.
<p>3. And this Essence hath about or in himself a Stable, and firm Operation,
wanting nothing, most full, and giving abundantly.
<p>4. One thing is the Beginning of all things, for it giveth all things;
and when I name the Good, I mean that which is altogether and always Good.
<p>5. This is present to none, but God alone; for he wanteth nothing, that
he should desire to have it, nor can anything be taken from him; the loss
whereof may grieve him; for sorrow is a part of evilness.
<p>6. Nothing is stronger than he, that he should be opposed by it; nor
nothing equal to him, that he should be in love with it; nothing unheard
of to be angry, with nothing wiser to be envious at.
<p>7. And none of these being in his Essence, what remains, but only the
Good?
<p>8. For as in this, being such an Essence, there is none of the evils;
so in none of the other things shall the Good be found.
<p>9. For in all other things, are all those other things. as well in the
small as the great ; and as well in the particulars as in this living Creature
the greater and mightiest of all.
<p>10. For all things that are made or generated are full of Passion, Generation
itself being a Passion ; and where Passion is there is not the Good; where
the Good is, there is no Passion; where it is day, it is not night, and
where it is night, it is not day.
<p>11. Wherefore it is impossible, that in Generation should be the Good,
but only in that which is not generated or made.
<p>12. Yet as the Participation of all things is in the Matter bound, so
also of that which is Good. After this manner is the World good, as it
maketh all things, and in the part of making or doing it is Good, but in
all other things not good.
<p>13. For it is passible, and movable, and the Maker of passible things.
<p>14. In Man also the Good is ordered (or Taketh Denomination) in comparison
of that which is evil; for that which is not very evil, is here good; and
that which is here called Good, is the least particle, or proportion of
evil.
<p>15. It is impossible therefore, that the Good should be here pure from
Evil; for here the Good groweth Evil, and growing Evil, it doth not still
abide Good; and not abiding Good it becomes Evil.
<p>16. Therefore in God alone is the Good, or rather God is the Good.
<p>17. Therefore, O Asclepius, there is nothing in men (or among Men) but
the name of Good, the thing itself is not, for it is impossible; for a
material Body receiveth (or Comprehendeth), is not as being on every side
encompassed and coarcted with evilness, and labours, and griefs, and desires,
and wrath, and deceits, and foolish opinions.
<p>18. And in that which is the worst of all, Asclepius, every one of the
forenamed things, is here believed to be the greatest good, especially
that supreme mischief the pleasures of the Belly, and the ring-leader of
all evils; Error is here the absence of the Good.
<p>19. And I give thanks unto God, that concerning the knowledge of Good,
put this assurance in my mind, that it is impossible it should be in the
World.
<p>20. For the World is the fulness of evilness ; but God is the fulness
of Good, or Good of God.
<p>21. For the eminencies of all appearing Beauty, are in the Essence more
pure, more sincere, and peradventure they are also the Essence of it.
<p>22. For we must be bold to say, Asclepius, that the Essence of God,
if he have an Essence, is that which is fair or beautiful; but no good
is comprehended in this World.
<p>23. For all things that are subject to the eye, are Idols, and as it
were shadows; but those things that are not subject to the eye, are ever,
especially the Essence of the Fair and the Good.
<p>24. And as the eye cannot see God, so neither the Fair, and the Good.
<p>25. For these are the parts of God that partake the Nature of the whole,
proper, and familiar unto him alone, inseparable, most lovely, whereof
either God is enamoured, or they are enamoured of God.
<p>26. If thou canst understand God, thou shalt understand the Fair, and
the Good which is most shining, and enlightening, and most enlightened
by God.
<p>27. For that Beauty is above comparison, and that Good is inimitable,
as God himself.
<p>28. As therefore thou understandest God, so understand the Fair and
the Good, for these are incommunicable to any other living Creatures because
they are inseparable from God.
<p>29. If thou seek concerning God, thou seekest or askest also of the
Fair, for there is one way that leads to the same thing, that is Piety
with Knowledge.
<p>30. Wherefore, they that are ignorant, and go not in the way of Piety,
dare call Man Fair and Good, never seeing so much as in a dream, what Good
is; but being enfolded and wrapped upon all evil, and believing that the
evil is the Good, they by that means, both use it unsatiably, and are afraid
to be deprived of it; and therefore they strive by all possible means,
that they may not only have it, but also increase it.
<p>31. Such, O Asclepius, are the Good and Fair things of men, which we
can neither love nor hate, for this is the hardest thing of all, that we
have need of them, and cannot live without them.
