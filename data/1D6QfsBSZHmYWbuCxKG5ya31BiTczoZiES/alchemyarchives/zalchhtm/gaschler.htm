<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Application Date: August 28, 1925</font></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to a process
of and means for transforming elementary atoms, particularly of uranium
and thorium with a view to hasten their spontaneous disintegration and
to increase their radioactivity, and the invention consists in subjecting
small quantities of the metal in a vaporizing chamber to a very high pressure
and temperature and in subjecting the metal vapor to the electrostatic
or electrolytic effect of strong, preferably direct currents.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Successful experiments have been
made with an electric energy of about 100 kilowatt-seconds per gram of
uranium or thorium. The electric current can be used for heating of the
metal as well as for the electric splitting up of the atoms.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to generate a very high
pressure during the heating of the metal and to obviate heat and light
radiation as far as possible, a thin filament of metal, weighing about
1 gram, is placed in a duct in a massive block of quartz or granite or
other refractory mineral insulating substance. The two ends of the filament
are extended through the block and clamped between two thick metal plates
which at the same time act as closures for the duct. Terminals are provided
on the metal plate for connection to the electric circuit. The duration
of the individual electric shocks is generally about 1-2 seconds. After
the conclusion of the process, the evaporated metal is recovered mechanically
or chemically and it will be found to be much more radioactive than the
original substance. This change of property may be regarded as due to a
transformation of elements.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The process can be used for the artificial
production of radium and meso-thorium, uranium X, and thorium X. Other
elements than uranium and thorium may be subjected to transformation in
this manner; for instance, mercury may in this manner be turned into gold.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The more the separated metal vapor
comes into contact with the pole surfaces and the higher the electric pressure,
the greater is the transformation effect. It is advisable, therefore, to
employ a heating circuit of low voltage and high amperage, and a separate
electrolyzing circuit of relatively low amperage and very high voltage.
For this purpose a pair of electrodes having a large surface is arranged
in the vaporizing chamber and connected to the high-pressure circuit which,
in order to produce a high resistance, includes a Crooke's of Geissler
tube.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When artificial metals are to be
produced on a large scale, the use of a filament is not practicable as
it requires too frequent replacement. It is therefore better ti supply
metallic vapor through a valve into the space containing the electric arc
and to withdraw it therefrom the same way.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having now particularly described
and ascertained the nature of may said invention and in what manner the
same is to be performed, I declare that what I claim is:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) A process of transforming elementary
atoms, particularly of uranium and thorium, and for producing artificial
radium and meso-thorium, consisting in subjecting small quantities of the
metal in a vaporizing chamber to high pressure and temperature and in subjecting
the separated metal vapor to the electrostatic or electrolytic effect of
strong, preferably direct current, substantially as set forth.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) A process according to Claim
1 in which the heating is effected by means of current of low voltage and
high amperage and the electrostatic or electrolytic splitting up of the
atoms, by means of a current of high voltage and low amperage, electrodes
having a large surface being employed in the high pressure circuit, the
metal, in the form of vapor, being supplied to and withdrawn from the space
containing the electric arc, through the medium of a valve.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) A device for carrying out the
process according to Claim 1, comprising a massive block of stone or other
mineral insulating substance having a duct for the reception of a thin
filament of the metal to be treated, the duct being closed by metal plates
which carry the electric terminals and which clamp the projecting ends
of the filament, substantially as set forth.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Alois Gaschler</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The object of this invention is to
transform materials of relatively low radioactivity into materials of relatively
high radioactivity and in general to increase the radioactivity of such
materials.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of my invention is
to increase the radioactivity of uranium and thorium.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of my invnetion os
to accelerate to a high degree the very slow sprontaneous transformation
of uranium and thorium.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general, in the process of my
invention, a small quantity of metal to be transformed is heated to a high
temperature under high pressure in an enclsoed chamber. The metallic vapor
is dissociated, and is exposed either to high electrostatic, unidirectional
curents at high potentials. The volume of the chamber is usually large
in proportion to the normal volume of the material to be transformed. The
currents and high potentials may be employed concurrent with the heating
step. I have used on the average approximately 100 kilowatt seconds of
electrical energy to produce 1 gram of uranium of thorium.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to produce a very high pressure,
while heating the metal and to avoid as much as possible the loss of energy
by the escape of heat, such as radiation, the metal is formed into a thin
filament weighing about 1 gram. The filament is fixed inside a channel
formed in a mass of insulating material, such as massive quartz, granite,
steatite or other stone or mineral. The two ends of the filament are attached
to two large metallic disks which act also as closing means for the channel.
These disks bear clamps to which leads for the source of current may be
attached. The duration of the current is usually 1-2 seconds. After cooling
the metal may be regained either by mechnaical or chemical means.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tested by different methods the product
obtained proves to be considerably more radioactive than the product before
transformation. This process can also be applied to the rational transformation
of other elements.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The efficiency of the transformation
is all the greater the higher the potential of the current. The efficiency
is also higher, the more the dissociated vapor comes in contact with the
pole faces. In operating this process it is advisable therefore to employ
not only a heating current of low voltage and high intensity but also a
current of small intensity and high voltage. It is therefore advisable
to insert into the chamber a second pair of electrodes of large surface
which is connected to a high tension circuit. A Crooks tube and a rectifier
tube may be empoyed in this circuit as a high tension resistance.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operating on a large scale, instead
of using metallic filaments, the metal to be transformed is introduced
into the chamber containing the electric arc via a valve and is also removed
from this chamber via a valve.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference may also be had to the
accompanying figure for an apparatus capable of carrying out my process.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to this drawing, <i>a</i>
is an earthenware jacket or sheathing, in which there is provided a cavity
or hollow space <i>b</i> for the reception of the metal to be transformed
which metal passes through the cavity <i>b</i> in the form of a filament
<i>c</i>
or, if mercury is involved, fills the passage <i>b</i> so as to form a
continuous conductor from the one metal palte <i>d</i> to the other metal
plate <i>e</i>. These two metal plates <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> are fitted
with the necessary current terminals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above is to be taken as merely
illustrative of my invention and the best mode of operating the same and
not as limiting the invention which is defined in the appended claims.</font>
