  <p><br>
Because many have written of the Philosopher's Stone without any
knowledge
of the art; and the few books extent, written by our learned
predecessors
and true masters hereupon, are either lost or concealed in the
collections
of such (however despised) as are lovers and seekers of natural
secrets,
we have taken a resolution to communicate our knowledge in this matter,
to the intent that those who are convinced the Philosophical Work is no
fiction, but grounded in the possibility of Nature, may be faithfully
directed
in their studies, and have an undoubted criterion to distinguish
between
such authors as are genuine sons of science and those who are spurious,
as writing by hearsay only. </p>
  <p>We shall not on this occasion give a summary of their names who
are
undoubted masters in the art, but shall take occasion to introduce
them,
as it may be necessary, in the following chapters; and as their sense
is
often concealed under a studied ambiguity of expression, we shall, out
of the gift which the Almighty hath dispensed to us, declare plainly,
and
without any reserve, the first matter of the Philosopher's Stone, the
manner
of proceeding through the whole process, both in the Vegetable and
Metallic
Tinctures, beginning with the Vegetable process first, as the most easy
and simple, yet well worthy the attention of all ingenious persons,
particularly
the practical chemists and preparers of medicines. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter II.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Vegetable Tincture, or the Process called
the
Lesser Circulation.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Very few of the true philosophers have touched upon this subject,
for
it seemed trifling in respect to the great work, as the process in
metals
is generally termed; but there is a modern publication in English, a
small
thin duodecimo, without any author's name, having for its title:
Aphorismi,
seu Circulus majus et Circulus minus, wherein the whole process is
plainly
laid down. </p>
  <p>This book is written by an undoubted master in the art; and no
treatise,
ancient or modern, is so explicit in the directions for conducting the
great work. The directions are very short, but much to the purpose,
provided
the reader has an idea what part of the work is alluded to. The author,
agreeable to his title, delivers his doctrine by way of aphorisms. But
to return from this digression. </p>
  <p>We proposed in this chapter to lay open the vegetable process, as
a
clue to the more important work in the mineral kingdom. A certain
person,
who is now living, and advertises balsam of honey, tincture of sage,
etc,
has turned his studies this way; and from his great abilities as a
professed
physician and botanist, has convinced all unprejudiced persons that
noble
tinctures may be extracted from vegetables. We hope this gentleman will
not despise our free communication, both to him and the public, if we
show
the insufficiency of his method, though it is ingenious, while we
establish
the rationale of ours on the never-failing ground of truth and
philosophy. </p>
  <p>He observes, with a precision which can only result from numerous
trials,
that different herbs impart their tinctures in such proportions of
alcohol
as he has found out. It is allowed that the volatile spirit and
balsamic
sulphur are thus extracted; but there are the essential, or fixed, salt
and sulphur of the herb yet left in the process. These require another
management to extract, which he is either ignorant of, or is so
disingenuous
as to conceal from the public; but that so noble a secret may lie open
to all for a general advantage, here follows a plain account of the
vegetable
work. </p>
  <p>Take any herb which is potent in medicine, and either extract the
tincture
with spirit of wine, or distil in the common way; reserve the distilled
water, or tincture, when separated from the feces, for use. Then take
the
feces, or Caput Mortuum, and calcine it to a calx. Grind this to
powder. </p>
  <p>That done, take the water, or tincture, and mix them together;
distil
again, and calcine, forcing the moisture over by a retort, in a wary
process,
calcining and cohobating the spirit on the salt till it attains a
perfect
whiteness and oily nature, like the finest alkali, commonly called
Flemish. </p>
  <p>As your salt requires it in the process, have in readiness more of
the
extracted tincture, or distilled spirit, that you may not work it,
viz.,
the salt, too dry; and yet proceed cautiously, not adding too much of
the
moisture, so that the dealbating, or whitening, may keep visibly
heightening
at every repetition of the process. Frequent experiments may enable you
to push it on to a redness, but a fine yellow is the best of all; for
the
process tends, in its perfection at this period, to a state of dryness,
and must be managed with a strong fire. By following these directions,
you have here the two tinctures in the Vegetable Kingdom, answering to
the white and red tinctures in the mineral. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter III.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Uses of the Vegetable Tinctures, with some
general remarks on their great efficacy in medicine.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>You have, by carefully following our directions above, procured
the
tinctures, white or yellow, in the Vegetable Kingdom. The yellow is
more
efficacious if the work is well performed; either of them, by being
exposed
in the air, will soon run into a thick, essential oil, smelling very
strong
of the plant, and the virtues of any quantity may be concentrated by
often
repeating the circulation. But you have no need of this, unless for
curiosity,
there being in your tinctures a real permanent power to extract the
essential
virtues of any herb you may require on immersion only, where the
essential
salt and volatile spirit, together with the sulphureous oil, are all
conjoined,
floating on the top of your tincture, and the terrestrial feces
precipitated
to the bottom; not as in distillation, or extraction of the tincture
with
alcohol, while the stalk and texture of the plant are entire; no, this
Vegetable Tincture devours the whole substance of the plant, and
precipitates
only the earthy particles acquired in its vegetation, which no degree
of
calcination could push to an alkali, without its essential salt. </p>
  <p>Such is the virtue of our Vegetable Tincture; and if the operation
be
never so often repeated with different herbs, it loses nothing of its
virtue,
or quantity or quality, casting up the virtues of whatever herb is
immersed,
and precipitating the earth as before when both are easily separated
and
the medicine preserved for use. </p>
  <p>Let a medicine, thus prepared, be examined, and the principles by
which
it is extracted, with the general methods of preparation; if the
distilled
water for instance, of any aromatical or balsamic herb, be took, common
experience will convince us that nothing but its volatile parts come
over
the head; but take the Caput Mortuum, and it will calcine after this
process,
and afford an alkali, which proves itself to be an essential salt by
its
pungency, and will, in the air, run to an oil, which is its essential
sulphur.
If you take the tincture extracted with alcohol, it is the same, only
the
more resinous parts of some herbs may enrich the extract, and the
volatile
sulphur giving the color and scent, be retained, which escapes in
distillation;
but the potent virtue or soul of the herb, if we may be allowed the
expression,
goes to the dunghill. It is the same if the expressed juice of the herb
is used; and if taken in powder, or substance, as it is sometimes
prescribed,
but little of its virtue, beyond its nourishing quality, can be
communicated
to the patient, except as a bitter or a vermifuge, in which cases,
perhaps,
it is best by way of infusion. </p>
  <p>Let none despise the operation above laid down, because it is not
to
be found in the ordinary books of chemistry; but consider the
possibility
of Nature, who brings about wonderful effects by the most simple
causes:
neither let any imagine this process so easy as to perform it without
some
trials, patiently attending to her operations and endeavoring to
account
for any deficiency in the course of his work. For this reason it will
be
proper that the artist forms to himself an idea what the intention is
to
procure, how far Nature has prepared his matter to work upon, in what
state
she has left it, and how far it may be exalted above the ordinary point
of virtue, which it could attain in the crude air, and this by the
Philosophic
Art assisting Nature, as a handmaid, with an administration of due
heat,
which is nutritive and not corrosive. </p>
  <p>A recapitulation of the foregoing process, with some remarks on
the
different stages, will be sufficient here to explain our meaning above,
and prepare the reader for what follows concerning the metallic
tincture,
or Stone of the Philosophers. </p>
  <p>The virtues of herbs and simples are confessedly great and
manifold;
among these, some are poisonous and narcotic, yet of great use in
medicine;
none of them but want some preparation or correction. Now the common
ways
of doing this are defective; neither preserving the virtue entire, nor
furnishing any menstruum capable of doing it with expedition and
certainty.
Alcohol, as was before observed, will extract a tincture and
distillation
a spirit. We reject neither of these methods in our work, as they are
useful
to decompound the subject; but we are not content with a part of its
virtues. </p>
  <p>To speak philosophically, we would have its soul, which is in its
Essential
Salt, and its spirit, which is in the Inflammable Sulphur. The body in
which these resided we are not concerned for; it is mere earth, and
must
return from whence it came: whereas the soul and spirit are
paradisiacal,
if the artist can free them from their earthy prison without loss; but
this can only be done by death. Understand us aright. Philosophically
speaking,
no more is meant than decomposition of the subject into its first
principles,
as the uniting them more permanently with an increase of virtue is most
emphatically called a resurrection and regeneration. Now this
decompounding
is to be done with judgment, so as not to corrode or destroy, but
divide
the matter into its integral parts. At this period of the work the
artist
will consider what is further intended, keeping Nature in view, who, if
she is properly assisted in her operations, produces from the
dissolution
of any subject something more excellent, as in a grain of corn, or any
vegetable seed, which by cultivation may be pushed to a surprising
produce;
but then it must die first, as our Blessed Saviour very emphatically
observes:
and let this saying dwell upon the artist's imagination, that he may
know
what he generally intends; for the whole philosophical work, both in
vegetables
and minerals, is only a mortifying of the subject, and reviving it
again
to a more excellent life. </p>
  <p>Now if the intention in the foregoing process was to increase
simply
any vegetable in its kind, the destruction and revivification must
follow
the ordinary course of vegetation by the medium of seed; and Nature can
only be assisted by fertilizing the soil, together with a proper
distribution
of heat and moisture. Yet there are not wanting authors, and
particularly
Paracelsus, who boldly describe processes wherein the vital quality of
the seed has been destroyed by calcination, and yet brought to life
again
at the pleasure of an artist. Such reveries are a scandal to
philosophy,
and a snare to the superficial reader, who is generally more struck
with
impossibilities, roundly asserted, than the modesty of true artists.
These
confess their operations are within the bounds of Nature, whose limits
they cannot surpass. </p>
  <p>The reader, then, will consider that our intention here is not to
increase
the seminal quality, but to concenter, in a little compass, the
medicinal
virtues of a herb. Nature is desirous of this in all her productions,
but
can only rise to such a point of perfection, in her ordinary course,
through
the crudity of the air and fixing power of the elements. Now if we take
the vegetables at that point of perfection to which she has pushed
them,
and farther assist her in decompounding, purifying, uniting, and
reviving
the subject, we obtain, what she could not otherwise produce, a real
permanent
tincture, the quintessence, as it is called, or such a harmonious
mixture
of the four elementary qualities as constitutes a fifth, from
thenceforth
indissoluble, and not to be debased with any impurity. </p>
  <p>But the virtue of this Vegetable Tincture is capable of
improvement
ad infinitum, in its own kind, by adding more of its spirit or
extracted
tinture, and repeating the circulation, which is every time more
speedily
finished, as there is a magnetical quality in the fixed salt, and
essential
oil, which assimilates to itself all the real virtues of what is added,
only rejecting the feculent, earthy qualities; so that in a grain of
the
tincture much virtue may be concentered, not at all corrosive or
ardent,
but friendly to the animal life, and most powerful as a medicine for
disorders
which the herb is appropriated to cure. Nay, something of this nature
was
still sought for by the distillers of ardent spirits, when phlegm has
been
drawn away from the volatile sulphur, till it becames proof spirit, as
it is termed, which will burn dry, a plain indication that it contained
nothing essential in it from the subject out of which it was extracted:
for that which is essential cannot be destroyed by the fire, but is
reddened
to an alkaline salt, having in its center an Incombustible Sulphur,
which,
on exposing to the air, manifests itself both to the sight and touch.
Now,
if this Salt and Sulphur are purified, and the distilled spirit, or
extracted
tincture, added, Nature finds a subject wherein she can carry her
operations
to the highest limit, if an artist furnishes her with proper vessels,
and
a degree of heat suitable to her intentions. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter IV.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Metallic Tincture.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>When we undertook a description of the vegetable process, it was
chiefly
with a view to familiarize the reader to a general idea of the
Philosophic
Work in metals, as both proceed upon the same principles, only the
mercuries
of metals are more difficult to extract, and stronger degrees of heat
are
required, as well as more of the artist's time and patience; neither
can
he succeed in the operation without frequent trials, and a constant
consideration
within
his mind as to what is within the possibility of Nature. </p>
  <p>For this purpose it is necessary to know the composition of
metals,
that he may know how to decompound and reduce them to their first
principles,
which is treated of very mysteriously by the philosophers, and
purposely
concealed, as the right key to unlock all the secrets of Nature. We
shall
be more explicit on this head, for the time draws near when, as
Sendivogius
has observed, the confection of the Stone will be discovered as plainly
as the making of cheese from rennet. But we warn the reader not to
imitate
Midas in the fable, by seeking the noble tincture in metals out of
covetousness;
for the true wise men seek only a medicine for human infirmities, and
esteem
gold but as it furnishes them with the means of independence and the
exercise
of universal beneficence. They communicate their talents, without vain
glory or ostentation, to such as are worthy searchers of Nature, but
concealing
their names as much as possible, while living, as well as their
knowledge
of the mystery from the world. </p>
  <p>We shall herein follow their example, and yet write more plainly
of
the Metallic Process than any of them has hitherto done, knowing that
the
providence of the Most High will effectually guard this Arcanum from
falling
into the hands of covetous gold seekers and knavish pretenders to the
Art
of Transmutation; because the first sort of men will, from their
impatience,
soon leave the simplicity of Nature for processes of more subtlety
invented
by the latter, and adapted to such avaricious views as the other have
formed,
who, judging of things by their own griping dispositions, know not the
noble liberality of Nature, but imagine some gold must be advanced
before
she will replenish their heaps. This is well foreseen by those smoke
sellers,
who receive what they can catch, as if they were her proper agents;
and,
having no conscience to put a stop to their imposition, the deception
is
kept up till all vanishes in smoke. </p>
  <p>Let it be observed, then, that all who have written on the art,
from
undoubted principles, assert that the genuine process is not expensive;
time and fuel, with manual labour, being all allowed for. Besides, the
matter to be wrought upon is easy to procure by the consent of all. A
small
quantity of gold and silver is, indeed, necessary when the stone is
made,
as a medium for its tinging either in the white or red tinctures, which
such pretenders have urged from books of philosophers as a plausible
pretence
to rob the avaricious both of their time and money; but their pretences
are so gross that none can be sufferers in this respect, if they have
not
justly deserved it. </p>
  <p>The reader may then rest assured that this process is not
expensive,
and reject all authors or practitioners who advance anything contrary
to
this established verity, remembering the simplicity of Nature in her
operations,
observing her frugal method in the production, and consummate wisdom in
the dissolution of things; always endeavoring at something perfect in a
new production. And because we are here proposing to help her in a
metallic
process, as before in the vegetable, let us consider a little how she
forms
the metals, in what state she has left them, and what need there is of
the artist's skill to assist her in pushing them to that degree of
perfection
they are capable of attaining. </p>
  <p>All true philosophers agree that the First Matter of metals is a
moist
vapor, raised by the action of the central fire in the bowels of the
earth,
which, circulating through its pores, meets with the crude air, and is
coagulated by it into an unctuous water, adhering to the earth, which
serves
it for a receptacle, where it is joined to a sulphur more or less pure,
and a salt more or less fixing, which it attracts from the air, and,
receiving
a certain degree of concoction from the central and solar heat, is
formed
into stones and rocks, minerals, and metals. These were all formed of
the
same moist vapor originally, but are thus varied from the different
impregnations
of the sperm, the quality of salt and sulphur with which it is fixed,
and
the purity of the earth which serves it for a matrix; for whatever
portion
of this moist vapor is taking along its impurities, is soon deprived of
heat, both solar and central, and the grosser parts, forming a
mucilaginous
substance, furnish the matter of common rocks and stones. But when this
moist vapor is sublimed, very slowly, through a fine earth, not
partaking
of a sulphureous unctuously, pebbles are formed; for the sperm of these
beautiful, variegated stones, with marbles, alabasters, etc., separates
this depurated vapor, both for their first formation and continual
growth.
Gems are in like manner formed of this moist vapor when it meets with
pure
salt water, with which it is fixed in a cold place. But if it is
sublimed
leisurely through places which are hot and pure, where the fatness of
sulphur
adheres to it, this vapor, which the philosophers call their Mercury,
is
joined to that fatness and becomes an unctuous matter, which coming
afterwards
to other places, cleansed by the afore-named vapors, where the earth is
subtle, pure, and moist, fills the pores of it, and so gold is made. </p>
  <p>But if the unctuous matter comes into places cold and impure,
lead,
or Saturn, is produced; if the earth be cold and pure, mixed with
sulphur,
the result is copper. Silver also is formed of this vapor, where it
abounds
in purity, but mixed with a laser degree of sulphur and not
sufficiently
concocted. In tin, or Jupiter, as it is called, it abounds, but in less
purity. In Mars, or iron, it is in a lesser proportion impure, and
mixed
with an adjust sulphur. </p>
  <p>Hence it appears that the First Matter of metals is one thing, and
not
many, homogeneous, but altered by the diversity of places and sulphurs
with which it is combined. The philosophers frequently describe this
matter. </p>
  <p>Sendivogius calls it heavenly water, not wetting the hands; not
vulgar,
but almost like rain water. When Hermes calls it a bird without wings,
figuring thereby its vaporous nature, is it well described. When he
calls
the sun its father and the moon its mother, he signifies that it is
produced
by the action of heat upon moisture. When he says the wind carries it
in
its belly, he only means that the air is its receptacle. When he
affirms
that which is inferior is like that which is superior, he teaches that
the same vapor on the surface of the earth furnishes the matter of rain
and dew, wherewith all things are nourished in the vegetable and animal
kingdoms. This now is what the philosophers call their Mercury and
affirm
it to be found in all things, as it is in fact. This makes some suppose
it to be in the human body, others in the dunghill, which has often
bewildered
such as are fond of philosophical subtleties, and fly from one thing to
another, without any fixed theory about what they would seek, expecting
to find in the Vegetable or Animal Kingdoms the utmost perfection of
the
Mineral. To this mistake of theirs, without doubt, the philosophers
have
contributed with an intention of hiding their First Matter from the
unworthy;
in which they were, perhaps, more cautious than is necessary, for
Sendivogius
declares that occasionally, in discourse, he had intimated the art
plainly
word by word to some who accounted themselves very accurate
philosophers;
but they conceived such subtle notions, far beyond the simplicity of
Nature,
that they could not, to any purpose, understand his meaning. Wherefore,
he professes little fear of its being discovered but to those who have
it according to the good pleasure and providence of the Most High. </p>
  <p>This benevolent disposition has induced him to declare more openly
the
First Matter, and fix the artist in his search of it to the mineral
kingdom;
for, quoting Albertus Magnus, who wrote that, in his time, grains of
gold
were found betwixt the teeth of a dead man in his grave, he observes
that
Albertus could not account for this miracle, but judged it to be by
reason
of the mineral virtue in man, being confirmed by that saying of Morien:
"And this matter, O King, is extracted from thee." But this is
erroneous,
for Morien understood those things philosophically, the mineral virtue
residing in its own kingdom, distinct from the animal. It is true,
indeed,
in the animal kingdom mercury, or humidity, is as the matter, and
sulphur,
or marrow in the bones, as the virtue; but the animal is not mineral,
and
vice versa. If the virtue of the animal sulphur were not in man, the
blood,
or mercury, could not be coagulated into flesh and bones; so if there
were
not a vegetable sulphur in the vegetable kingdom, it could not
coagulate
water, or the vegetable mercury, into herbs, etc. The same is to be
understood
in the mineral kingdom. </p>
  <p>These three kingdoms do not, indeed, differ in their virtue, nor
the
three sulphurs, as every sulphur has a power to coagulate its own
mercury;
and every mercury has a power of being coagulated by its own proper
sulphur,
and by no other which is a stranger to it. </p>
  <p>Now the reason why gold was found betwixt the teeth of a dead man
is
this: because in his lifetime mercury had been administered to him,
either
by unction, turbid, or some other way; and it is the nature of this
metal
to ascend to the mouth, forming itself an outlet there, to be evacuated
with the spittle. If, then, in the time of such treatment, the sick man
died, the mercury, not finding an egress, remained in his mouth between
his teeth, and the carcass becoming a natural matrix to ripen the
mercury,
it was shut up for a long time, till it was congealed into gold by its
own proper sulphur, being purified by the corrosive phlegm of the man's
body; but this would never have happened if mineral mercury had not
been
administered to him. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter V.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Second Matter, or Seed in Metals.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>All philosophers affirm, with one consent, that metals have a seed
by
which they are increased, and that this seminal quality is the same in
all of them; but it is perfectly ripened in gold only, where the bond
of
union is so fixed that it is most difficult to decompound the subject,
and procure it for the Philosophical Work. But some, who were adepts in
the art, have by painful processes taken gold for their male, and the
mercury,
which they knew how to extract from the less compacted metals, for a
female:
not as an easier process, but to find out the possibility of making the
stone this way; and have succeeded, giving this method more openly to
conceal
the true confection, which is most easy and simple. We shall,
therefore,
set before the reader a landmark, to keep him from tripping on this
difficulty,
by considering what is the seed wherein the metals are increased, that
the artist may be no longer at a loss where to seek for it, keeping in
view the writings of our learned predecessors on this subject. </p>
  <p>The seed of metals is what the Sons of Wisdom have called their
mercury,
to distinguish it from quicksilver, which it nearly resembles, being
the
radical moisture of metals. This, when judiciously extracted, without
corrosives,
or fluxing, contains in it a seminal quality whose perfect ripeness is
only in gold; in the other metals it is crude, like fruits which are
yet
green, not being sufficiently digested by the heat of the sun and
action
of the elements. We observed that the radical moisture contains the
seed,
which is true: yet it is not the seed, but the sperm only, in which the
vital principle floats, being invisible to the eye. But the mind
perceives
it, and in a true artist, as a central point of condensed air, wherein
Nature, according to the will of God, has included the first principles
of life in everything, as well animal and vegetable as mineral; for in
animals the sperm may be seen, but not the included principle of
impregnation:
this is a concentered point, to which the sperm serves only as a
vehicle,
till, by the action and ferment of the matrix, the point wherein Nature
has included a vital principle expands itself, and then it is
perceivable
in the rudiments of an animal. So in any seculent fruit (as, for
instance,
in an apple), the pulp or sperm is much more in proportion than the
seed
included; and even that which appears to be seed is only a finer
concoction
of sperm, including the vital stamina; as also in a grain of wheat the
flour is only the sperm, the point of vegetation is an included air,
which
is kept by its sperm from the extremes of cold and heat, till it finds
a proper matrix, where the husk being softened with moisture, and
warmed
by the heat, the surrounding sperm putrefies, making the seed, or
concentered
air, to expand and to burst the husk carrying along in its motion a
milky
substance, assimilated to itself from the putrefied sperm. This the
condensing
quality of the air includes in a film and hardens into a germ, all
according
to the purpose of Nature. </p>
  <p>"If this whole process of Nature, most wonderful in her
operations,
was not constantly repeated before our eyes, the simple process of
vegetation
would be equally problematical with that of the philosophers; yet how
can
the metals increase, nay, how can anything be multiplied without seed?
The true artists never pretend to multiply metals without it, and can
it
be denied that Nature still follows her first appointment? She always
fructifies
the seed when it is put into a proper matrix. Does not she obey an
ingenious
artist, who knows her operations, with her possibilities, and attempts
nothing beyond them? A husbandman meliorates his ground with compost,
burns
the weeds, and makes use of other operations. He steeps his seed in
various
preparations, only taking care not to destroy its vital principle;
indeed,
it never comes into his head to roast it, or to boil it, in which he
shows
more knowledge of Nature than some would-be philosophers do. Nature,
like
a liberal mother, rewards him with a more plentiful harvest, in
proportion
as he has meliorated her seed and furnished a more suitable matrix for
its increase. </p>
  <p>"The intelligent gardener goes farther; he knows how to shorten
the
process of vegetation, or retard it. He gathers roses, cuts salads, and
pulls green peas in winter. Are the curious inclined to admire plants
and
fruit of other climates? He can produce them in his stoves to
perfection.
Nature follows his directions unconstrained, always willing to obtain
her
end, viz., the perfection of her offspring. </p>
  <p>"Open your eyes here, yet studious searchers of Nature! Is she so
liberal
in her perishing productions, how much more in those which are
permanent,
and can subsist in the fire? Attend, then, to her operations; if you
procure
the metallic seed, and ripen that by art which she is many ages in
perfecting,
it cannot fail but she will regard you with an increase proportioned to
the excellency of your subject. </p>
  <p>"The reader will be apt to exclaim here: "Very fine! All this is
well;
but how shall the seed of metals be procured, and whence comes it that
so few know how to gather it?' To this it is answered that the
philosophers
have hitherto industriously kept that a profound secret; some out of
selfish
disposition, though otherwise good men. Others, who wished only for
worthy
persons to whom they might impart it, could not write of it openly,
because
covetousness and vanity have been governing principles in the world:
and,
being wise men, they knew that it was not the will of the most High to
inflame and cherish such odious tempers, the genuine offspring of pride
and self-love, but to banish them out of the earth, wherefore they have
been withheld hitherto. But we, finding no restraint on our mind in
that
respect, shall declare what we know: and the rather because we judge
the
time is come to demolish the golden calf, so long had in veneration by
all ranks of men, insomuch that worth is estimated by the money a man
possesses;
and such is the inequality of possessions that mankind are almost
reducible
to the rich, who are rioting in extravagance, and the poor, who are in
extreme want, smarting under the iron hand of oppression. Now the
measure
of inequality among the rich hastens to its limit, and the cry of the
poor
is come before the Lord: 'Who will give them to eat till they shall be
satisfied?" </p>
  <p>Hereafter the rich shall see the vanity of their possessions when
compared
with the treasures communicated by this secret; for the riches it
bestows
are a blessing from God, and not the squeezing of oppression. Besides,
its chief excellence consists in making a medicine capable of healing
all
diseases to which the human body is liable, and prolonging life to the
utmost limits ordained by the Creator of all things. </p>
  <p>There want not other reasons for the manifestation of the process;
for
skepticism has gone hand in hand with luxury and oppression, insomuch
that
the fundamental truths of all revealed religion are disputed. These
were
always held in veneration by the possessors of this art, as may be seen
from what they have left upon record in their books: and, indeed, the
first
principles of revealed religion are demonstrated from the whole
process,
for the seed of metals is shown in corruption, and raised in
incorruption;
it is sown a natural body, and raised a spiritual body; it is known to
partake of the curse which came upon the earth for man's sake, having
in
its composition a deadly poison, which can only be separated by
regeneration
in water and fire; it can, when it is thoroughly purified and exalted,
immediately tinge imperfect metals and raise them to a state of
perfection,
being in this respect a lively emblem of that seed of the woman, the
Serpent
Bruiser, who, through His sufferings and death, hath entered into
glory,
having thenceforth power and authority to redeem, purify, and glorify
all
those who come unto Him as a mediator between God and mankind. </p>
  <p>Such being our motives, we can no longer be silent concerning the
seed
of metals, but declare that it is contained in the ores of metals, as
wheat
is in the grain; and the sottish folly of alchemists has hindered them
from adverting to this, so that they have always sought it in the
vulgar
metals, which are factitious and not a natural production, therein
acting
as foolishly as if a man should sow bread and expect corn from it, or
from
an egg which is boiled hope to produce a chicken. Nay, though the
philosophers
have said many times the vulgar metals are dead, not excepting gold,
which
passes the fire, they could never imagine a thing so simple as that the
seed of metals was contained in their ores, where alone it ought to be
expected; so bewildered is human ingenuity, when it leaves the beaten
track
of truth and Nature, to entangle itself in a multiplicity of fine-spun
inventions. </p>
  <p>The searcher of Nature will rejoice greatly in this discovery, as
grounded
in reason and sound philosophy, but to fools it would be in vain,
should
even wisdom herself cry out in the streets. Wherefore, leaving such
persons
to hug themselves in their own imaginary importance, we shall go on to
observe that the ores of metals are our First Matter, or sperm, wherein
the seed is contained, and the key of this art consists in a right
dissolution
of the ores into a water, which the philosophers call their mercury, or
water of life, and an earthy substance, which they have denominated
their
sulphur. </p>
  <p>The first is called their woman, wife, Luna, and other names,
signifying
that it is the feminine quality in their seed; and the other they have
designated their man, husband, Sol, etc., to point out its masculine
quality. </p>
  <p>In the separation and due conjunction of these with heat, and
careful
management, there is generated a noble offspring, which they have for
its
excellency called the quintessence or a subject wherein the four
elements
are so completely harmonized as to produce a fifth subsisting in the
fire,
without waste of substance, or diminution of its virtue, wherefore they
have given it the titles of Salamander, Phoenix, and Son of the Sun. </p>

  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter VI.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Dissolution and Extraction of the Seed in
Metals.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>The true Sons of Science have always accounted the dissolution of
metals
as the master key to this art, and have been particular in giving
directions
concerning it, only keeping their readers in the dark as to the
subject,
whether ores, or factitious metals, were to be chosen: nay, when they
say
most to the purpose, then they make mention of metals rather than the
ores,
with an intention to perplex those whom they thought unworthy of the
art. </p>
  <p>Thus the author of the "Philosophical Duet," or a dialogue between
the
stone, gold, and mercury, says: </p>
  <p>"By the omnipotent God, and on the salvation of my soul, I here
declare
to you earnest seekers, in pity to your earnest searching, the whole
Philosophical
Work, which is only taken from one subject and perfected in one thing.
For we take this copper, and destroy it crude and gross body; we draw
out
its pure spirit, and after we have purified the earthy parts, we join
them
together, thus making a Medicine of a Poison. </p>
  <p>It is remarkable that he avoids mentioning the ore, but calls his
subject
copper, which is what they call a metal of the vulgar, being indeed
factitious,
and not fit for the confection of our Stone, having lost its seminal
quality
in the fire; but in other respects it is the plainest discovery extant,
and is accounted to be so by Sendivogius. </p>
  <p>Yet the reader is not to suppose that the ore of copper is to be
chosen
in consequence of that assertion, as preferable to others. No, the
mercury,
which is the metallic seed, is attainable from all, and is easier to be
extracted from lead, which is confirmed by the true adepts, advising us
to seek for the noble child where it lies in a despised form, shut up
under
the seal of Saturn; and, indeed, let it be supposed, for an
illustration
of this subject, that any one would propose to make malt, he may effect
his purpose in the other grains, but barley is generally chosen,
because
its germ is made to sprout by a less tedious process, which is to all
intents
and purposes what we want in the extraction of our mercury: neither are
the proceeding different in both cases, if regard is had to the fixity
of ores, and the ease with which barley gives forth its seminal virtue
from the slight cohesion of its parts. </p>
  <p>Let the artist remark how a maltster manages his grain by wetting,
to
loosen the cohesion of its parts, and leaves the rest to Nature,
knowing
that she will soon furnish the necessary heat for his purpose, if he
does
not suffer it to escape by mismanagement in his laying of his heap too
thin, or raising the fermentation too high by a contrary proceeding, as
it is well known actual fire may be kindled from the fermentation of
vegetable
juices when crude; and ripe corn, under such treatment, would soon be
fit
for nothing but hogs, or the dunghill. Now the intention is to raise
such
a fermentation only as will draw out the vegetable mercury without
spoiling
it, either for the earth, if it was cast there to fructify, or the
kiln,
if it is to be fixed at that precise point, by exhaling the
Adventitious
moisture, and thus preserving the whole strength of its seminal quality
for the purposes of brewing, or making malt spirits. </p>
  <p>Suppose, then, an artist would extract a mineral mercury from the
ores,
and chooses an ore for his subject. He can only assist Nature in the
process
by stirring up a central heat, which she includes in everything not
already
putrefied, as a root of its life, in which it is increased. The medium
by which this central heat is put in motion is known to be
putrefaction;
but the ores of every kind are found to resist putrefaction in all
known
processes extant. They may, indeed, when they have been fluxed in the
fire,
contract a rust from the air, which is a gradual decomposition of their
substance, but this is only the natural decay of a dead body, not the
putrefaction
of
its sperm for the purposes of propagation; and we are sensible from the
heat of furnaces which is required to flux the ores, and the slowness
of
their decay when deprived of their seminal qualities, by fluxation,
that
a heat which would destroy the seed in vegetables may be necessary in
the
first stages of putrefaction for the ores, as they will bear a red fire
without being fluxed or losing anything but their sulphureous and
arsenical
impurities; in short, a matter in itself as much extraneous to the seed
of metals, as the chaff to the wheat; wherefore, a careful separation
of
these by roasting, or otherwise, is deservedly reckoned among the first
operations for the putrefaction of ores, and the rather because that
which
has been calcined, by having its pores opened, is rendered attractive,
both of the air and other menstruums proper for its decomposition. </p>
  <p>Let the artist, therefore, by fire and manual operation, separate
the
impure qualities from his subject, pounding, washing, and calcining,
till
no more blackness is communicated to his menstruum, for which pure rain
water is sufficient. It will be seen on every repetition of this
process,
that what fouls the water is extraneous and the ore yet exists in its
individual
metallic nature, except it is fluxed by a too intense heat, in which
case
it is no longer fit for our purpose; therefore fresh ore is to be used.
  </p>
  <p>The matter being thus prepared, its central fire will be awakened,
if
it is treated properly, according to the process for extracting
quicksilver
from its ores, by keeping it in a close heat, which is continued
without
admission of the crude air, till the radical moisture is elevated in
the
form of a vapor, and again condensed into a metallic water, analogous
to
quicksilver. </p>
  <p>This is the true mercury of the Philosophers, and fit for all
their
operations in the Hermetic Art. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter VII.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Separation and Further Treatment of our
Philosophical
Seed.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>The Putrefaction of our subject being thus completed, it exists
under
two forms; the moisture which was extracted, and the residuum, being
our
Philosophical Earth. The water contains its seminal virtue, and the
earth
is a proper receptacle, wherein it may fructify. Let the water, then,
be
separated and kept for use; calcine the earth, for an impurity adheres
to it which can only be taken away by fire, and that, too, of the
strongest
degree; for here there is no danger of destroying the seminal quality,
and our earth must be highly purified before it can ripen the seed.
This
is what Sendivogius means when he says: Burn the sulphur till it
becomes
Sulphur incombustible. Many lose in the preparation what is of most use
in the art; for our mercury is corrected (healed) by the sulphur, else
it would be of no use. Let, therefore, the earthy part be well
calcined,
and return the mercury on the calcined earth; afterwards draw it off by
distillation; then calcine, cohere, and distill, repeating the process
till the mercury is well corrected by the sulphur, and the sulphur is
purified
to a whiteness, and goes on to red, a sign of its complete
purification,
where you have the Philosophical Male and Female ready for conjunction.
This must now be managed with judgment, as the noble child may be yet
strangled
in the birth; but all things are easy to an ingenious artist, who knows
the proportion of mixture required and accommodates his operations to
the
intention of Nature, for which purpose we shall faithfully conduct him
according to our ability. </p>
  <hr width="62%">
  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter VIII.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Union or Mystical Marriage in the
Philosophical
Process.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>The seed and its earth being thus prepared, nothing remains but a
judicious
conjunction of them together; for it too much moisture prevails, the
philosophical
egg may burst before it can go through the heat necessary for its
hatching.
To speak without a figure. Our subject must now be enclosed in a small
glass vial, made strong enough to bear a due heat, which is to be
raised
gradually to the highest degree: the best form for this vessel being
that
of an oil flask, with a long neck; but these are much too thin in
substance
for this operation. In such a vessel the mixture is to be sealed
hermetically,
and digested so long till it is fixed into a dry concretion; but, if,
as
we observed, the moisture should predominate, there is great danger of
the vessel bursting, with a vapor which cannot be concentered by the
fixing
quality in the matter. The intention is, nevertheless, to fix our
subject
in the heat, and so render its future destruction impossible. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, if the dry, fixing quality of the sulphur
exceeds
so as not to suffer an alternate resolution of its substance into
vapors,
and a re-manifestation of its fixing quality, by causing the whole to
subside
in the bottom of the vessel till the matter again liquefies and
sublimes
(which Ripley has well described), there is danger of the whole
vitrifying;
and thus you shall have only glass instead of the noble tincture. To
avoid
these two extremes it is very proper that the purified earth be reduced
by manual operation to an impalpable fineness, and then its corrected
mercury
must be added, incorporating both together till the earth will imbibe
no
more. This operation will require time, with some degree of the
artist's
patience; for however the humidity may seem disproportionate, on
letting
it rest awhile, a dryness on the surface of your matter will show that
it is capable of imbibing more, so that the operation is to be repeated
till it is fully saturated, which may be known from its bearing the air
without any remarkable change of surface from dry to humid; or, on the
contrary, if so, the conjunction is well made, which is farther
confirmed
if a small portion be spread upon a thin plate if iron, heated till it
flows gently like wax, casting forth the moisture with heat and again
absorbing
it when cold, so as to return to the former consistence; but if a
clamminess
ensures it is a sign you have exceeded in the quantity of humidity,
which
must be extracted by distilling again and repeating the process till it
is right. </p>
  <p>Your sulphur and mercury being thus united, put them into a glass
vial,
before described, in such a quantity as to take up one-third of its
contents,
leaving two-thirds, including the neck, for the circulation of your
matter. </p>
  <p>Secure the neck of your vial with a temporary luting at the first,
and
give a gentle heat, observing whether it sublimes and fixes
alternately.
If it easily sublimes and shows a disposition, at intervals, to subside
at the bottom of the vessel, all is well conducted hitherto; for the
moisture
will first be predominant, which the sulphur can only perfectly absorb
as the heat is increased for the perfect ripening of our Paradisiacal
Fruit.
Therefore, if it manifests a too early disposition for fixing, add more
of the corrected mercury till Luna rises resplendent in her season; she
will give place to the Sun in his turn. This would be the language of
an
adept on this occasion, only suggesting that the female quality in our
prepared seed is first active, while the male is passive, and that it
is
afterwards passive while the male is active, such being the case in all
vegetation; for every germ which is the first rudiments of a herb or
tree,
is predominant in moisture, and then only becomes fixed when it is
fully
concocted in the seed. </p>

  <b><font size="+1">Of the Further Treatment and Ripening of our Seed.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>This is deservedly called the Great Work of the Philosophers; and
the
artist having done his part hitherto, must seal up his glass
hermetically,
an operation which every maker of barometers knows how to perform. </p>
  <p>The glass is then to be put into a furnace with a proper nest
contrived
for
its reception, so as to give a continual heat from the first to the
fourth
degree, and to afford the artist an opportunity, from time to time, of
inspecting every change which his matter assumes during the process,
without
danger of damping the heat and putting a stop to its perfect
circulation.
A heat of the first degree is sufficient at the first, for some months,
in which method much time may be lost by a young practitioner, till he
knows how to handle his matter from experience; but then he is not so
liable
to be disappointed with the bursting of his vessel or the matter
vitrifying. </p>
  <p>Thus you have arrived at the desired seed-time in our
Philosophical
Work, which, though it may appear in the artist's power to ripen,
depends
no less on the Divine blessing than the harvest, which a painful
husbandman
has not the presumption to expect otherwise than from God's
beneficence. </p>
  <p>There are many requisites to entitle anyone to the possession of
our
philosophical harvest, and the true laborers in it have sought for such
persons to whom they might communicate it, by evident testimony of the
senses, after which they account the confection of our Stone an easy
process,
manageable by women and children; but without such a communication,
there
is a necessity that those who would undertake it are endowed by Nature
with an ingenious mind, patient to observe and accurate to investigate
her ordinary appearances which, from their commonness, are less noticed
than such phenomena as are more curious though of less importance; yet
these for the most part employ the precious time of those egregious
triflers,
the modern virtuosi. These smatterers in discovery of a shell or
butterfly
differently streaked from those of the same kind: and all the while
water,
air, earth, fire, with their continual changes and resolutions into one
another, by the medium of our atmosphere, through the efficacy of the
central
and solar heat, are unstudied by these would-be philosophers; so that a
sensible rustic has more real knowledge, in this respect, than a
collector
of natural rarities, and makes a much wiser use of the experiences he
has
acquired. </p>

  </center>
  <p>Supposing such dispositions in the artist as have been previously
laid
down, and the work well performed hitherto, for his direction herein we
shall describe the changes which our subject undergoes during the
second
part of the process, commonly called the Great Work of the
Philosophers. </p>
  <p>Our vessel being warily heated at the first for fear of its
cracking,
an ebullition of the contained matter is brought on, so that the
moisture
is alternately circulated in white fumes above, and condensed below,
which
may continue for a month or two, nay longer, increasing the heat
gradually
to another degree, as your matter discovers a disposition for fixing,
by
the vapor continuing at longer intervals condensed, and rising in a
lesser
quantity, of an ash color, or other dark shades, which it will assume
as
a medium to perfect blackness, the first desirable stage in our
harvest.
Other colors may be exhibited in this part of the work without danger,
if they pass transiently; but if a faint redness, like that of the corn
poppy, continues, the matter is in danger of vitrifying, either from an
impatient urging of the fire, or the moisture not being sufficiently
predominant.
An ingenious artist can remedy this by opening his vessel and adding
more
of the corrected mercury, sealing it up as before; but a novice would
do
much better to prevent it by governing his fire according to the
appearances
of his matter, with judgment and patience, increasing it if the
moisture
manifests its predominancy too long, and slacking if the dry prevails,
till such time as the vapors become dark; and after they have continued
for some time at rest, a pellicle or film on the matter shows its
disposition
for fixing, retaining the vapor captive for some time, till it breaks
through
at different places on its surface (much like the bituminous substance
of coal in a soldering fire), with darker clouds, but quickly
dissipated,
and growing less in quantity, till the whole substance resembles molten
pitch, or the aforesaid bituminous substance, bubbling less and less,
resting
in one entire black substance at the bottom of your glass. This is
called
the blackness of black, the head of the crow, etc., and is esteemed a
desirable
stage in our philosophical generation, being the perfect putrefaction
of
our seed, which will ere long show its vital principle by a glorious
manifestation
of Seminal Virtue. </p>

  <p>When the putrefaction of our seed has been thus completed, the
fire
may be increased till glorious colors appear, which the Sons of Art
have
called Cauda Pavonis, or the Peacock's Tail. These colors come and go,
as heat is administered approaching to the third degree, till all is of
a beautiful green, and as it ripens assumes a perfect whiteness, which
is the White Tincture, transmuting the inferior metals into silver, and
very powerful as a medicine. But as the artist well knows it is capable
of a higher concoction, he goes on increasing his fire till it assumes
a yellow, then an orange or citron color; and then boldly gives a heat
of the fourth degree, till it acquires a redness like blood taken from
a sound person, which is a manifest sign of its thorough concoction and
fitness for the uses intended. </p>

  <p>Having thus completed the operation, let the vessel cool, and on
opening
it you will perceive your matter to be fixed into a ponderous mass,
thoroughly
of a scarlet color, which is easily reducible to powder by scraping, or
otherwise, and in being heated in the fire flows like wax, without
smoking,
flaming, or loss of substance, returning when cold to its former
fixity,
heavier than gold, bulk for bulk, yet easy to be dissolved in any
liquid,
in which a few grains being taken its operation most wonderfully
pervades
the human body, to the extirpation of all disorders, prolonging life by
its use to its utmost period; and hence it has obtained the appellation
of "Panacea," or a Universal Remedy. Therefore, be thankful to the Most
High for the possession of such an inestimable jewel, and account the
possession
of it not as the result of your own ingenuity, but a gift bestowed, of
God's mere bounty, for the relief of human infirmities, in which your
neighbor
ought to share jointly with you, without any grudging or sinister
views,
according to the charge delivered to the Apostles: Freely have you
received,
freely communicate, remembering at the same time not to cast your
pearls
before swine; in a word, to withhold the manifestations of Nature you
are
enabled to exhibit, by the possession of our Stone, from the vicious

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter XIII.</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">Of the Transmutation.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>It is much to be lamented that the seekers of natural knowledge in
this
art propose, principally, the Science of Transmutation as their
ultimate
view, and overlooking the chief excellency of our Stone as a medicine. </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding this grovelling spirit, we shall commit the issue
to
His Providence, and declare the Transmutation (which, indeed, the
philosophers
do) openly, after which we shall describe the further circulation of
our
Stone for an increase of its virtues, and then make an end of our
treatise. </p>
  <p>When the artist would transmute any metal --- for instance, lead
---
let a quantity be melted in a clean crucible, to which let a few grains
of gold in filings be cast; and when the whole is melted, let him have
in readiness a little of the powder, which will easily scrape off from
his "stone," the quantity inconsiderable, and cast it on the metal
while
in fusion. </p>
  <p>Immediately there will arise a thick fume, which carries off with
it
the impurities contained in the lead, with a crackling noise, and
leaves
the substance of the lead transmuted into most pure gold, without any
kind
of sophistication; the small quantity of gold added, previous to
projection,
serves only as a medium to facilitate the transmutation, and the
quantity
of your tincture is best ascertained by experience, as its virtue in
proportioned
to the number of circulations you have given after the first has been
completed. </p>
  <p>For instance: when you have finished the stone, dissolve it in our
mercury
again, wherein you have previously dissolved a few grains of pure gold.
This operation is done without trouble, both substances readily
liquefying.
Put it into your vessel, as before, and go through the process. There
is
no danger in the management, but breaking your vessel; and every time
it
is thus treated its virtues are increased, in a ratio of ten to one
hundred,
a thousand, ten thousand, etc., both in medicinal and transmuting
qualities;
so that a small quantity may suffice for the purposes of an artist
during
the remaining term of his life. </p>
