<p>When Phebus was entered the signe of the ramm,
<br>In the month of march when all Doth springe,
<br>Lying in my bed, an old man to me came.
<br>Laying his hand on my buysy head slumbringe,
<br>"I am," he said, "Tyme, producer of cunninge.
<br>Awake &amp; rise, prepare thy selfe quickly;
<br>My entent is to bring thee to the Campe of philosophy.
<p><b>2</b>
<p>"Bloomes &amp; blossomes plentiful in that feild
<br>Bynn pleasantly flourishinge, vernant with collers gay.
<br>Lively water fountaines, eke beastes both tame &amp; wild
<br>Overshadowed with trees fruitful, &amp; on every spray
<br>Melodiously singinge, the birdes doe sitt &amp; say:
<br>'Father, sonn, &amp; holy ghoste, to one god in persons three;
<br>Impery &amp; honor be to the holy trinitye.'"
<p><b>3</b>
<p>Lo! thus when he had said, I arose swiftly,
<br>Doeing on my clothes in haste with agility.
<br>Towardes the camp, wee went, of philosophi,
<br>The wonderful sightes there for to see.
<br>To a large greate gate, father tyme first brought me,
<br>Which closed was; then he to me saide,
<br>"Each thing his time hath; be thou nothing Dismaied."
<p><b>4</b>
<p>The great admiracion I tooke into my selve,
<br>With sore &amp; huge perturbacions of minde,
<br>Beholdinge the gate fastned with lockes twelve.
<br>I fantasied but smalle that time should be my freind.
<br>"Why studiest thou, man," quoth he; "art thou blind?"
<br>With a rodd he touched me, whereat I Did Downe fall
<br>Into a straunge sleepe, &amp; In a Dreame he showed me all.

The Dreame of Mr Blomefeild</h3></center>
<b>5</b>
<p>Audite somnium meum quod vidi.
<br>The Mt yeere of Christ, D L &amp; seven,
<br>In the month of March, asleep as I did lye,
<br>Late in the night, of the clocke about eleven,
<br>In spiritu rapt I was, soodenly into heaven;
<br>Where I saw sittinge in most glorious maiesty
<br>Three beholding, I adored but one in deitye:
<p><b>6</b>
<p>A Spirit incircumscript with burninge heate incombustible;
<br>Light of brightnes permanent, as fountaine of all light;
<br>Three knit in one, with glory incomprehensible,
<br>Which to behold I had a greate Delighte.
<br>This trulye to attayne surmounted my might;
<br>But a voice from that glorious brightnes to me saide,
<br>"I am one god of Immeasurable maiesty: be not afraide."
<p><b>7</b>
<p>In this vision so cleare, that it selfe did so extend
<br>With a voice most pleasant, being three &amp; one,
<br>Pearsed my minde, &amp; taught me to comprehende
<br>The darke sayinges of philosophers each one:
<br>The altitude, latitude &amp; profundity of the stone
<br>To be three in substance &amp; one in essence,
<br>A most heavenly treasure procreate by quintessence.
<p><b>8</b>
<p>The studied I what quintessence should be;
<br>Of visible thinges apparant to the eye
<br>The fifth being, even a straunge privity
<br>In every substance resting invisibly.
<br>The invisible godheade is the same, thought I,
<br>Prime cause of beinge &amp; the prime essence,
<br>And of this macrocosm the most suffren quintessence.
<p><b>9</b>
<p>This is the heavenly and secret potencyall
<br>That Devided is, &amp; resteth indivisible
<br>In all thinges animall, vigitall, &amp; minerall;
<br>Whose vertue in them, &amp; strength, is invisible.
<br>From god it cometh, &amp; god maketh it sencible
<br>To some preelect; to other doth it denay.
<br>As I sate thus museinge, a voice to me did say:
<p><b>10</b>
<p>"Study thou no more of my being, but stedfastly
<br>Beleeve this trinity equally knit in one.
<br>Further of my Secretes to muse is but folly,
<br>Passing thy capassity, &amp; all human reason."
<br>The heavens closed up againe in that season.
<br>Then father Tyme set me at the gate,
<br>And Delivered me a key to enter in thereat:
<p><b>11</b>
<p>The key of knowledge &amp; excellent Science,
<br>Whereby all secretes of philosophi are reserate:
<br>The Secretes of nature sought out by Diligence,
<br>Voidinge fables envious of fooles inveterate:
<br>With recipe &amp; Decipe, this science is violate.
<br>Therefore to me this key he did Dispose,
<br>The secretes of this art to open &amp; Disclose.
<p><b>12</b>
<p>This said father Tyme, this key when he mee tooke:
<br>"Unlock," quoth he, "this gate by thy selve."
<br>And then upon him sorrowfully Did I looke,
<br>Saying that one key undoe could not lockes twelve.
<br>"Whose axe is sure," quoth he, "both the head &amp; helve,
<br>Hold will together till the tree Downe fall.
<br>So open thou the first locke, &amp; thou hast opened all."
<p><b>13</b>
<p>"What is this first locke named, tell me then,
<br>I Pray thee," said I, "and what shall I it call?"
<br>"It is," quoth he, "the secret of all the wise men,
<br>Chaos; in the bodies called the first originall,
<br>Prima materia, our mercury, our menstruall,
<br>Our vitrioll, our sulphur, our lunary most of price.
<br>Put the key in the locke, &amp; it will open with a trice.
<p><b>14</b>
<p>Then the key of knowledge buysily I tooke in hand,
<br>And began to search the hollownes of the locke;
<br>The wardes thereof I scare did understand,
<br>So craftily conveid they were in their stocke.
<br>I proved every way; at the last I did unlocke
<br>The crafty ginnes thus made for the nonce,
<br>And with it, the other lockes fell open all at once.
<p><b>15</b>
<p>At this gate opening, even in the entry
<br>A number of philosophers in the face I mett,
<br>Workeing all one way the secretes of philosophy
<br>Upon Chaos Darke, that amongst them was sett.
<br>Sober men of liveing, peaceable &amp; quiet,
<br>They buysily Disputed de materia prima,
<br>Reiecting cleane away simul stulta et frivola.
<p><b>16</b>
<p>Heere I saw the father of philosophers, Hermes.
<br>Heere I saw Aristotle with cheere most Iocunde.
<br>Heere I saw Morien &amp; Senior in turba more &amp; lesse;
<br>Geber, Democritus, Albert, Bacon, &amp; Ramond;
<br>The monke, &amp; the chanon of Bridleington so profound;
<br>Workeing most soberly, who said unto me:
<br>"Beware though beleeve not all that thou dost see,
<p><b>17</b>
<p>"But if thou wilt enter this camp of philosophy,
<br>With thee take time to guide thee in the way;
<br>For by pathes &amp; broade waies, Deep vallyes &amp; hils high
<br>Here shalt thou finde with sightes pleasant &amp; gay.
<br>Some thou shalt finde which unto thee shall say,
<br>'Recipe this &amp; that,' &amp; with a thowsand thinges more
<br>Decipe thy selfe &amp; others as they have done before."
<p><b>18</b>
<p>Then father Tyme &amp; I by favour of these men,
<br>Such sightes to see, passed foorth toward the campe
<br>Where wee met Disguised philosophers ten,
<br>With porfiries &amp; morters, ready to grind &amp; stamp;
<br>Their heades shakeing, their hands full of the cramp;
<br>Some lame with spasums, some febull, wann, &amp; blind,
<br>With arsneck &amp; sulphur, to this art most vnkind.
<p><b>19</b>
<p>These were Broke the preste &amp; yorke in cotes gay,
<br>Which robbed king Henry of a million of gold;
<br>Martin pery, mayre, &amp; thomas De Lahaye,
<br>Saying that the king they greatly enrich would.
<br>They wispered in his eare, &amp; this tale him told:
<br>"Wee will worke for your highnes the Elixer vite,
<br>A princely worke called opus regale."
<p><b>20</b>
<p>Then brought they in the vicar of Maldon
<br>With his lyon greene, that most royall secret,
<br>Richard record &amp; little Master Edon
<br>(Their mettals by corrosives to calcinate &amp; fret);
<br>Hugh oldcastle &amp; Sir Robert greene with them mett,
<br>Rosting &amp; broileinge all thinges out of kinde,
<br>Like philosophers left off with loss in the end.
<p><b>21</b>
<p>Yet brought they forth thinges beautifull to sight,
<br>Deluding the king thus from day to day;
<br>With copper cytrinate for the red, and albefied for the white,
<br>And with mercury rubified in a glass full gay.
<br>But at the last, in the fire, it went away.
<br>All this was because they never knew the verity
<br>Of altitude, latitude, &amp; profunditye.
<p><b>22</b>
<p>Thence father Tyme brought me to a wildernes,
<br>Into a thicket haveing by pathes many a one.
<br>Steps &amp; footinges I saw there more &amp; lesse,
<br>Wherein the foresaid men had wandered &amp; gone.
<br>There I saw Marcasites, minerals, &amp; many a stone,
<br>As yrides, talke, &amp; alom lay digged from the ground,
<br>The mines of leade &amp; Iron that they had out fownde.
<p><b>23</b>
<p>No marvell I trow, though they were much set by,
<br>That with so greate riches could endue a kinge.
<br>So many sundry waies to fill up his treasurie
<br>With filthy matter, great charges in to bring:
<br>The very next way a prince to bring to begginge,
<br>And make a noble realme &amp; common wealth decay.
<br>These are royall philosophers the cleane contrary way.
<p><b>24</b>
<p>From thence foorth I went, Tyme beinge my guide,
<br>Through a greene wood where birdes sang clearly,
<br>Tyll wee came to a feild, pleasant, large, &amp; wide,
<br>Which he said was called the camp of philosophy.
<br>There downe we sate, to heere the sweete harmony
<br>Of the divers birdes in their sweete notes singinge,
<br>And to receive the flavour of the flowers springinge.
<p><b>25</b>
<p>Heere Iuno, heere Pallas, heere Apollo doe Dwell;
<br>Heere true philosophers take their dwelling place.
<br>Heere duly the muses nine drinck of pirenes well.
<br>No bosting broyler heere the art can deface.
<br>Heere lady philosophi hath her royall palace,
<br>Holding her court in her high consistory,
<br>Sitting with her councelers most famous of memory.
<p><b>26</b>
<p>Thus one said unto me (an ancient man was he),
<br>Declareing forth the matter of the stone,
<br>Saying that he was sent thither to comfort me,
<br>And of his religion for to chuse me to be one.
<br>A cloth of tyssew he had him upon,
<br>Verged aboute with pearles of collers fresh &amp; gay.
<br>He proceeded with his taile, &amp; againe thus did say:
<p><b>27</b>
<p>"Heere all occult secretes of Nature knowne are;
<br>Heere all the elementes from thinges are drawne out.
<br>Heere fire, air, &amp; water in earth are knit together;
<br>Heere all our secret worke is truly brought aboute.
<br>Heere you must learne in thy busines to be stout:
<br>Night &amp; day thou must tend thy work buysily,
<br>Haueing constant pacience &amp; never to be weary."
<p><b>28</b>
<p>As we sate talkeing by the rivers running cleere,
<br>I cast my eye aside, &amp; there I did behold
<br>A lady most excellent, sitting in her arbor,
<br>Which clothed was in a robe of fine gold,
<br>Set about with stones &amp; pearles many fold.
<br>Then asked I father Tyme what hee should be.
<br>"Lady philosophy," quoth he, "most excellent of beauty."
<p><b>29</b>
<p>Then I was stricken with an ardent avidity
<br>The place to approche to, where I saw that sight.
<br>I rose up to walk, &amp; the other two went before me
<br>Against the arbor, till I came foorth right.
<br>Then we all three, humbly as we might,
<br>Bowed down our selves to her with humility,
<br>With greate admiracion extolling her felicity.
<p><b>30</b>
<p>Shee shewed her selue both gentill &amp; benigne:
<br>Her gesture &amp; countenace gladdid our cominge.
<br>From her seate imperiall, shee did her selfe incline,
<br>As a lady loveing perfect wisedome &amp; cunninge.
<br>Her goodly poems her beauty was surmountinge:
<br>Her speech was decorate with such auriate sentence,
<br>Far above excelling famous tullye's eloquence.
<p><b>31</b>
<p>The father tyme unto the Lady saide,
<br>"Pleaseth your highnes this poore man to heere,
<br>Him to assist with your most gracious aide?"
<br>Then she commanded him with me to draw neere.
<br>"Son," said the lady, "be thou of good cheere.
<br>Admitted thou shalt be amongst greate &amp; smale,
<br>A disciple to be of my secretes all."
<p><b>32</b>
<p>Then she committed me vnto Ramon Lully,
<br>Commanding him my simplenes to instructe,
<br>And in her secretes to induce me fully:
<br>Into her privy garden, for to be my conducte.
<br>First into a towre, most beautifull constructe,
<br>Father Ramond brought me, &amp; thence immediately
<br>He led me to her garden, planted most deliciously.
<p><b>33</b>
<p>Among the faire trees, one tree in especiall,
<br>Most vernant &amp; pleasant, appeared to my sight.
<br>A name inscribed, "the tree philosophical,"
<br>Which to behold I had great delight.
<br>Then to philosophy my troth I plight,
<br>Her maiesty to serve, &amp; to take greate paine,
<br>The fruites of that tree with Ramond to attaine.
<p><b>34</b>
<p>Then Raymonde shewed me budes fiftene
<br>Spring of the tree, &amp; fruites fiftene mo.
<br>"Of the which," said he, "proceedeth that wee doe mean,
<br>That all philosophers covet to attaine to,
<br>The blessed stone, one in number &amp; no mo:
<br>Our great Elixer most high of price,
<br>Our azoc, our Adrope, our basilicke, our cockatrice.
<p><b>35</b>
<p>"This is our antimony &amp; our red leade,
<br>Gloriously shineing as Phebus at midday.
<br>This is our crowne of glory &amp; Diadem of our head
<br>Whose beames resplendent shall never fade away.
<br>Who attaineth this treasure never can decay:
<br>It is a Iewell so abundant &amp; excellent,
<br>That one graine will endure ever to be permanent.
<p><b>36</b>
<p>"I leave thee heere now, our secretes to attaine.
<br>Look that thou earnestly my counsell doe ensue:
<br>There needes no blowing at the cole be, nore paine,
<br>But at thine owne ease here maist thou continue.
<br>Old, Ancient writers beleeue which are true,
<br>And they shall thee learne to pass it to bringe.
<br>Beware therefore of many, &amp; hold thee to one thinge.
<p><b>37</b>
<p>"This one thing is nought els but the lyon greene,
<br>Which some fooles imagine to be vitrioll roman.
<br>It is not that thing that the philosophers meane,
<br>For nothing to us any corosive doe pertaine.
<br>Understand, therefore, or else thy hand refraine
<br>From this hard science, lest you doe worke amiss.
<br>For I will tell the truth; marke now what it is:
<p><b>38</b>
<p>"Greene of collor our lyon is not truly,
<br>But vernant &amp; greene, evermore endurringe.
<br>In his most bitternes of death, he is lively;
<br>In the burning fire he is evermore springinge.
<br>Therefore the Salamander, by the fire liveing,
<br>Some men doth him call, &amp; some another name:
<br>The mettalline menstruall, it is even the same.
<p><b>39</b>
<p>"Some call it allso a substance exuberate.
<br>Some call it mercury of mettalline essence;
<br>Some, limus deserti, from his body evacuate;
<br>Some, the eagle flyinge from the north with violence.
<br>Some call it a tode for his great vehemence.
<br>But few or none at all doe name it in his kind:
<br>It is a privy quintessence; keepe it well in minde.
<p><b>40</b>
<p>"This is not in sight, but resteth invisible
<br>Tyll he be forced out of Chaos darke,
<br>Wher he remaineth ever indivisible.
<br>And yet in him is foundacion of our worke;
<br>In our lead it is, so that thou it marke:
<br>Dryve it out of him, so out of all other.
<br>I can tell thee no better if thou were my brother.
<p><b>41</b>
<p>"This Chaos Darke the mettals I doe call,
<br>Because as in a prison it resteth them within.
<br>The secret of nature they keepe in thrall
<br>Which by a meane wee doe out twine;
<br>The workeing whereof the easlier to begin,
<br>Lift up thy head and looke upon the heaven,
<br>And I will learn thee truly to know the planetes seven.

Incipit Theorica per Wll Blomefild</h3></center>
<b>51</b>
<p>We intend now, through grace Devine,
<br>In few wordes of Chaos to write;
<br>Light from darknes to cause foorth to shine,
<br>Long before hidden, as I shall recyte.
<br>In every thing unknown, it is requisite
<br>A secret to search out which is invisible,
<br>Materiall of our mastery, a substance invincible.
<p><b>52</b>
<p>Because I should not seeme to disclose
<br>Long hidden treasure unto me committed
<br>Of my lord god, therefore plaine of Chaos
<br>My purpose shalbe there of to be acquited.
<br>For Daungerous burdens are not easily lighted.
<br>In faith, therefore, my selfe I shall endevor
<br>Lightly to Discharge me, before god for ever.
<p><b>53</b>
<p>Devoutly, therefore, o lord unto thee I call:
<br>Send me thy grace to make explanacion
<br>Of Chaos. For thou art opener of secretes all,
<br>Which ever art ready to heare the exclamacion
<br>Of thy meeke servantes, which with harty humiliacion
<br>To thee doe apply: send me now thy grace,
<br>Of thy secretes to write in due order, time, &amp; place.
<p><b>54</b>
<p>Chaos is no more to say (this is doubtelesse,
<br>As Ovid witnesseth in his metamorphosyn)
<br>But a certaine rude substance, indigestaque moles,
<br>Haveing divers natures resting it within,
<br>Which with the contrarie, wee may out twine
<br>By philosopher's arte. Who so the feate doth know,
<br>The fower elementes from Chaos can out drawe.
<p><b>55</b>
<p>This Chaos, as all thinges, hath Dimencions three,
<br>Which well considered shall follow the effect:
<br>That is, altitude, latitude, &amp; profunditye,
<br>By the which three all the matter is detect.
<br>Unto these dimencions who hath not a respect
<br>Shall neuer Devide this Chaos in his kinde,
<br>But after his labour, shall find fraud in the end.
<p><b>56</b>
<p>Chaos is to us the vine tree, white &amp; red.
<br>Chaos is each beest, fowle, &amp; fish in his kinde.
<br>Chaos is the ore &amp; mine of tinn &amp; leade,
<br>Of gold and silver that we doe out finde,
<br>Iron &amp; Copper, which thinges doe binde
<br>And hold our sight &amp; wittes to them bounde;
<br>The secret hidd in them, that wee ne understand.
<p><b>57</b>
<p>Out of this mistie Chaos, the philosophers expert
<br>Do a substance out draw, called a quintessence,
<br>Craftely deviding the fower elementes by art,
<br>With greate wisedome, study, &amp; dilegence.
<br>The which high secret hath a divine influence
<br>That is supernaturall (of fooles thought impossible),
<br>An oyle or much like, called incombustible.
<p><b>58</b>
<p>The mastery of this plainly to shew thee,
<br>In forme here after I will it Declare,
<br>Setting foorth heere the philosopher's tree,
<br>Wherein the whole art now I shall compare.
<br>In this faire tree sixteene fruites are,
<br>More pretious then gold in thy stomacke to digest.
<br>Put thy hand therto, &amp; taste of the best.
<p><b>59</b>
<p>And leste the fault should imputed be
<br>In me or in other that of this art do write,
<br>I set before thee the true figure of the tree,
<br>Wherein orderly this art I will recyte.
<br>Understand my sentence that thou maist worke right,
<br>Considering as I said that Chaos is all thing
<br>That we begin of, the true way of workinge.
<p><b>60</b>
<p>Put case thy Chaos be animall, vigetall, or minerall;
<br>Let reason guide thee to worke after the same.
<br>If thou workest out of kind, then loosest thou all;
<br>For nature with nature ioyeth &amp; maketh true game.
<br>Worke animall with his kind, &amp; keep thee out of blame;
<br>Vigetall &amp; minerall in their order Dew,
<br>Then shalt thou be taken for a philosopher trew.
<p><b>61</b>
<p>When thou hast fownde what it is indeede,
<br>Then knowest thou thy forme, what by reason it must be.
<br>Search it wittyly &amp; Draw from him his seede.
<br>There is then thy altitude superficiall to see;
<br>The latitude anon shall appeare: beleeue mee.
<br>When thou hast Devided the elementes asunder,
<br>Then the profundity amongest them lyeth hid under.
<p><b>62</b>
<p>Here is materia prima et corpus confusum,
<br>But not yet the matter which philosophers Doe treate.
<br>Yet the one conteineth the other in somme,
<br>For forma, materia, et corpus together are knite.
<br>With the menstruall water thou must them frett,
<br>That the body first be finely calcinate,
<br>After dissolved &amp; purely evacuate.
<p><b>63</b>
<p>Then is he the trew mercury of philosophers,
<br>Unto the mastry apt, needful, &amp; serviable.
<br>More of this thing I need not much rehearse,
<br>For this is all the secret most commendable.
<br>Materia prima it is called multiplicable,
<br>The which by art must be exuberate:
<br>Then is it the matter that mettals were of generate.
<p><b>64</b>
<p>Sulphur of nature, &amp; not that which is common,
<br>Of mettals must be made if that thou wilt speede;
<br>Which will turn them to his kind every each one.
<br>His tincture into them abroad he will spreade.
<br>It will fix mercury common at thy neede,
<br>And make him apt, true tincture to receive.
<br>Worke as I have told thee, &amp; it shall not thee deceive.
<p><b>65</b>
<p>Then of Sunn &amp; moone make your oile incombustible
<br>With mercury vegitable or els with lunary.
<br>Incerate therewith, &amp; make thy sulphur possible
<br>To abide the fire, &amp; allso thy mercury
<br>Be fixt &amp; flowinge. Then hast thou wrought truly,
<br>And so hast thou made a worke for the nonce,
<br>And gotten a precious stone of all stones.
<p><b>66</b>
<p>Fix it up now with perfect Decoction,
<br>And that with easy fire &amp; not vehement,
<br>For fear of induracion or vitrificacion,
<br>Lest you loose all &amp; thy labour be mispent.
<br>With eight Daies &amp; nightes this stone is sufficient:
<br>The greate Elixer, most high of price,
<br>Which Ramond calleth his basilicke &amp; cockatrise.
<p><b>67</b>
<p>To this excellent worke greate cost neede not to be:
<br>Many glasses or pots about it to breake.
<br>One glas, one furnace, &amp; no mo of necessity;
<br>Who mo doth spoile, his wittes are but weake.
<br>All this is stilled in a limbecke with a beacke
<br>(As touching the order of distillacions),
<br>And with a blind head in the same for solucions.
<p><b>68</b>
<p>In this thy mercury taketh his true kinde.
<br>In this he is brought to multiplication.
<br>In this made he is Sulphur: beare it in mind.
<br>Tincture here in he taketh, &amp; inceration.
<br>In this the stone is brought to his perfect creacion,
<br>In one glas, one thing, one fire, &amp; no moe.
<br>This worke is complete: Da gloriam deo.

Incipit Practica: per Wll. Blomefild</h3></center>
<b>69</b>
<p>Wee have declared sufficiently the theoricke,
<br>In wordes misticall makeing Declaration.
<br>Let us now proceede plaine with the practicke,
<br>Largely of the matter to make explanacion.
<br>I will, therefore, that thou marke well my narracion,
<br>As true disciples my doctrine ye attend:
<br>My testament &amp; last will to you I doe commend.
<p><b>70</b>
<p>Be you holy, therefore, sober, honest, &amp; meeke.
<br>Love god &amp; your neighbor; to the poore be not unkinde.
<br>Overcome sathan; god's glory see you seeke.
<br>My sonn, be gentle to all men, as a freind;
<br>Fatherles &amp; widdowes have ever in thy minde.
<br>Innocentes love as brothers; the wicked Doe eschew.
<br>Let falsehood &amp; flattery goe, lest that thou it rew.
<p><b>71</b>
<p>Devoutely serve god, call Daily for his grace.
<br>Worship him in spirrit, with hart contryte &amp; pure;
<br>In no wise let sathan thy prayers deface.
<br>Looke thou be stedfast in faith &amp; trust most sure.
<br>Long sufference &amp; patience with thee let long endure;
<br>In all adversitye be gentle in thy hart
<br>Against thy foe: so shalt thou him convert.
<p><b>72</b>
<p>Most hartily therefore, o lord, to thee I call,
<br>Beseeching thee to ayd me with thy heavenly grace.
<br>Lovingly thy spirit upon me let Down fall,
<br>Overshadowing me that I at no tyme trespas.
<br>My lord &amp; my god, graunt me to purchase
<br>Full knowledge of thy secretes, with thy mercy to winn.
<br>Intending the truth, this practice I beginn.
<p><b>73</b>
<p>Listen now, my Sonn, &amp; thy eares encline.
<br>Delight have thou to learne this practice, sage and true.
<br>Attend my sayinges &amp; note well this Discipline,
<br>These rules following: Doe as it doth ensue:
<br>This labor once begun, thou must it Continue
<br>Without teadious sluggerdy &amp; slothfull wearynes;
<br>So shalt thou thereby acquire to thee right riches.
<p><b>74</b>
<p>In the name of God, this secret to attaine,
<br>Ioyne thou in one body with a perfect unity
<br>First the red man &amp; the white woman, these twaine.
<br>One of the man's substance, &amp; of the woman's three;
<br>By liquifaction together ioyned they must be:
<br>The which coniunction is called Diptatyve,
<br>That is made betweene man &amp; wife.
<p><b>75</b>
<p>Then after that they be one body made,
<br>With the sharp teeth of a Dragon finely
<br>Bring them to dust. The next must be had:
<br>The true proportion of that dust truly
<br>In a true ballance, waying it equally
<br>With three times as much of the firy dragon fell,
<br>Mixing all together: then hast thou done well.
<p><b>76</b>
<p>Thy substance together thus proporcionate,
<br>Put into a bed of glas with a bottome large &amp; round,
<br>There in due time to dye, &amp; be regenerate
<br>Into a new nature: three natures in one bound.
<br>Then be thou glad that ever thou it found,
<br>For this is the Iewell that shall stand thee most in stead,
<br>The crowne of glory &amp; diademe of thy head.
<p><b>77</b>
<p>When thou hast thus mixed thy matter as is said,
<br>Stop well thy glas, that the dragon goe not owt;
<br>For he is so subtill that if he be overlayde
<br>With fyre unnaturall (I put thee owt of dowbte),
<br>For to escape he wyll search all abowte.
<br>Therefore with gentyll fyre, looke that thou kepe it in:
<br>So shalt thou of him the whole maistry wynne.
<p><b>78</b>
<p>The whole maistery here of, Duly to fullfill,
<br>Set thy glas &amp; matter upon the athanor,
<br>One furnace called the philosopher's Dunghill.
<br>With a temperate heate workeing evermore,
<br>Night &amp; day continually have fuell in store,
<br>Or turfe, or saw Dust, or dry chipped segges,
<br>That the heate be equipolent to the henn upon her eggs.
<p><b>79</b>
<p>Such heate continuall, looke that it doth not lacke.
<br>Forty Dayes long for their perfect unition
<br>In them is made, for first it turneth blacke.
<br>This colour betokeneth the right putrifaction.
<br>This is the beginning of perfect conception
<br>Of your infant into a new generacion:
<br>A most precious Iewell for our great consolation.
<p><b>80</b>
<p>Forty dayes then more, thy matter shall turne white
<br>And cleere as pearles, which is a declaracion
<br>Of voideing away of his cloudes, darke, &amp; night.
<br>This sheweth our infante's organisacion,
<br>Our white elixer, most cleere in his carnacion.
<br>From white unto all coloures without faile,
<br>Like to the rainbow or to the peacocke's taile.
<p><b>81</b>
<p>So foorth augment thy fire continually;
<br>Under thy matter easely they must be fedd.
<br>Till those colours begon, rule it wisely;
<br>For soone after appeareth yellow, the messenger to red.
<br>When that is come, then hast thou well sped,
<br>And hast brought forth a stone of price,
<br>Which raymond calleth his basylicke &amp; cockatrice.
<p><b>82</b>
<p>Then forty Daies to take his whole fixation:
<br>Let it so stand in heate most temperate,
<br>That in that time you spare the firmentation
<br>To encrease him withall. That it be not violate,
<br>Beware of fire &amp; water, for that will it suffocate.
<br>Take one to an hundreth unto this confection,
<br>And upon crude mercury make thy proiection.
<p><b>83</b>
<p>One of the stone, I meane, upon an hundreth fold
<br>(After the first &amp; second right fermentation)
<br>Of mercury crude, turneth it to fine gold:
<br>As fine &amp; as good, as naturall in ponderacion
<br>(The stone is so vehement in his penetracion);
<br>Fixt &amp; fusible, as the goldsmithe's sowder is.
<br>Worke as I have said, &amp; you cannot Doe amisse.
<p><b>84</b>
<p>Now give thankes to the blessed trinity
<br>For the benefit of this pretious stone,
<br>That with his grace so much hath lightened thee,
<br>Him for to know, being three in one.
<br>Hold up thy handes to his heavenly throne;
<br>To his maiesty let us sing hosanna:
<br>Altissimo Deo sit honor et gloria.
<p>Amen.
