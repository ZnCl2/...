two of <i>Paracelsus</i> <i>Principals</i>.</font></b></center>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>There bee two <i>Great</i> <i>Families</i> of <i>Things</i>; You may
terme them by severall Names; <i>Sulphureous</i> and <i>Mercureall</i>,
which are the <i>Chymists</i> Words: (For as for their <i>Sal</i>, which
is their Third Principle, it is a Compound of the other two;) <i>Inflammable</i>,
and
<i>Not Inflammable;</i> <i>Mature</i> and <i>Crude;</i> <i>Oily</i>
and <i>Watry</i>. For wee see that in <i>Subterranies</i> there are, as
the <i>Fathers</i> of their <i>Tribes</i>, <i>Brimstone</i> and <i>Mercury</i>:
In <i>Vegetables</i>, and <i>Living</i> <i>Creatures</i> there is <i>Water</i>
and <i>Oile</i>: In the <i>Inferiour</i> <i>Order</i> of <i>Pneumaticalls</i>
there is <i>Aire</i> and <i>Flame</i> : And in the <i>Superiour</i>, there
is the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Starre</i>, and the <i>Pure</i> <i>Sky</i>.
And these Paires, though they be unlike in the Primitive Differences of
Matter, yet they seeme to have many Consents: For <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Sulphure</i>
are principall Materialls of <i>Metalls</i>; <i>Water</i> and <i>Oyle</i>,
are principall Materialls of <i>Vegetables</i>, and <i>Animals;</i> And
seeme to differ but in <i>Maturation</i>, or <i>Concoction:</i> <i>Flame</i>
(in Vulgar Opinion) is but <i>Aire</i> <i>Incensed;</i> And they both have
Quicknesse of Motion, and Facilitie of Cession, much a like: And the <i>Interstellar
Sky</i>, (though the Opinion be vaine, that the <i>Starre</i> is the
<i>DenserPart</i>
of his <i>Orbe</i>,) hath notwithstanding so much Affinity with the <i>Starre</i>,
that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the <i>Starre</i>. Therefore,
it is one of the greatest <i>Magnalia Naturae</i>, to turne <i>Water</i>
or <i>Watry</i> <i>Iuyce</i> into
<i>Oile</i> or
<i>Oily</i> Juyce: Greater
in Nature, than to turne <i>Silver</i>, or <i>Quick-silver</i>, into <i>Gold</i>.
<p>The Instances we have, wherein <i>Crude</i> and <i>Watry</i> Substance
turneth into <i>Fat</i> and <i>Oily</i>, are of foure kindes. First in
the
<i>Mixture</i> of <i>Earth</i> and <i>Water</i>; which mingled by the
help of the Sunne, gather a Nitrous Fatnesse, more than either of them
have severally; As we see, in that they put forth <i>Plants</i>, which
need both Juyces.
<p>The Second is in the <i>Assimilation</i> of <i>Nourishment</i>, made
in the <i>Bodies</i> of <i>Plants</i>, and <i>Living</i> <i>Creatures;</i>
Whereof <i>Plants</i> turne the Juyce of meere <i>Water</i> and <i>Earth</i>,
into a great deale of <i>Oily</i> <i>Matter</i>: <i>Living</i> <i>Creatures</i>,
though much of their <i>Fat</i>, and <i>Flesh</i>, are out of <i>Oily Aliments</i>,
(as
<i>Meat</i>, and <i>Bread</i>,) yet they Assimilate also in a Measure
their
<i>Drink</i> of <i>Water</i>, &amp;c. But these two Wayes of <i>Version</i>
of <i>Water</i> into <i>Oyle</i>, (namely by <i>Mixture</i>, and by <i>Assimilation)</i>
are by many Passages, and Percolations, and by long Continuance of soft
<i>Heats</i>,
and by Circuits of Time.
<p>The third is in the <i>Inception</i> of <i>Putrefaction; As</i> in <i>Water
Corrupted;</i> And the <i>Mothers</i> of <i>Waters</i> <i>Distilled;</i>
Both which have a kinde of <i>Fatnesse</i>, or <i>Oyle</i>.
<p>The Fourth is in the <i>Dulcoration</i> of some <i>Metalls;</i> As <i>Saccharum
Saturni</i>, &amp;c.
<p>The Intension of <i>Version</i> of <i>Water</i> into more <i>Oyly Substance</i>,
is by <i>Disgestion</i>; For <i>Oile</i> is almost Nothing else but <i>Water
Disgested;</i> And this <i>Disgestion</i> is principally by <i>Heat</i>;
Which <i>Heat</i> must be either <i>Outward</i>,or <i>Inward:</i> Againe,
it may be by Provocation, or Excitation; Which is caused by the Mingling
of Bodies already <i>Oily</i>,or <i>Disgested;</i> For they will somewhat
Communicate their Nature with the rest. <i>Disgestion</i> also is strongly
effected by direct <i>Assimulation</i>, of <i>Bodies</i> <i>Crude</i> into
<i>BodiesDigested;</i>
As in <i>Plants</i>,and <i>Living Creatures</i>,whose Nourishment is farre
more Crude than their Bodies: But this <i>Disgestion</i> is by a great
Compasse, as hath beene said. As for the more full Handling of these two
Principles, whereof this is but a Taste; (the Enquiry of which is one of
the Profoundest Enquiries of Nature,) We leave it to the <i>Title</i> of
<i>Version</i>
of <i>Bodies</i>; And likewise to the <i>Title</i> of the
<i>FirstCongregations</i>
of <i>Matter;</i> Which like a Generall Assembly of Estates, doth give
Law to all <i>Bodies</i>.
