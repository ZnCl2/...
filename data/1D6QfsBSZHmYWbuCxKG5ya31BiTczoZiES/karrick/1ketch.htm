  <hr width="62%"></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">October 28, 1932</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As per your verbal request at
your
meeting March 30, 1932, we are submitting the following report relative
to plans and estimates for a pilot plant to treat coal by the Karrick
Process.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You will recall that under our
instructions
we were to make a study of the possibility of building a pilot treating
plant for the sum of $50,000 mentioned at the meeting as an approximate
total cost of said plant. With this figure in mind we proceeded with
the
work, Mr Grover Wardrop doing the designing with the close supervision
of Mr Karrick and with such assistance as I could render. Also Mr C. N.
Stutz and Mr Wm. Larson, senior civil engineering students assisted
materially
in compiling data and in computations, and their thesis now in the
Engineering
Library at the University of Utah is a valuable treatise on this
subject.
We also refer you to the thesis by Mr Schmutz of the School of Business
on the oil reserves and oil shales of Utah, which is now in the
University
library. During the time that Mr Wardrop worked on this project, Mr
Karrick
carried on further coal tests in the laboratory at the University, and
was assisted by Dr C.R. Kinney of the Chemistry Department, verifying
and
demonstrating the various steps of the process of various Utah coals.
Arrangements
were thus made for Mr Karrick and Mr Wardrop to have close contact
throughout
the work.</font> </p>

  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Smoke Elimination for Salt
Lake
City ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No arguments need be given
relative
to the economic importance of smoke elimination for Salt Lake City. The
exodus of many of our best citizens from Salt Lake in recent years
because
of the intolerable smoke condition in the minter months makes it
imperative
that a complete solution of this problem be effected at once if we are
to maintain even normal growth for our city. We have gas for those who
can afford it, we have stokers for some residences and apartment
houses,
but we still have smoke produced by kitchen ranges, heating stoves and
hand-fired furnaces to such an extent that already in 1932 the familiar
black blanket of dense smoke has appeared, much to the disgust of
everyone.
No one who can afford to move out will live here under such conditions.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Present Heating &amp;
Cooking
Equipment in SLC ~</b> [ Table not included here ]</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The obvious conclusion from the
above
data is that a suitable solid smokeless fuel must be provided if the
smoke
cloud is to be eliminated.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To build a pilot plant for the
treatment
of Utah coals, and to run such a plant for a year or two, we believe,
would
contribute largely to the solution of SLC&#8217;s smoke problem and add
valuable
information toward the development of Utah&#8217;s greatest resource. A
slight
change in the market favoring better prices for coal, oil and gasoline
would at once make this type of development very attractive. The cost
per
ton capacity for this small pilot plant is high and the labor cost is
high,
but the capacity could be doubled at comparatively small cost and we
believe
the operation would then be more economical. However, we have confined
this report to a pilot plant of smallest practical capacity to
represent
commercial operations. This was done in order to keep within your
instructions
as nearly as possible, and to determine facts that might guide us later
in the design of a large commercial plant. We do not believe it
practicable
to design a large commercial plant until a pilot plant is run long
enough
to ascertain all the facts. We know of no other way to get these facts.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is likely that Utah coal
fields
will eventually be large users of power, and this power could be a
by-product
of this process of treating coal in Carbon County. The large amount of
gas thus produced could be converted into power and the gas also used
in
the mining towns and for future industries.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the importance of
the
experiment to the State of Utah, we recommend that steps be taken to
finance
such a plant as is herewith described.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In conclusion we wish to state
that
this report could not have been prepared without the help of Mr
Karrick,
who has furnished practically all the data relative to the process.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the first attempt to
make
plans and specifications for a commercial sized coal plant using the
Karrick
process.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Location of Plant ~</font></b>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After preliminary studied of
the
possible sites for the plant it soon became apparent to us that the
proper
place to build such a plant is in Carbon County near the mines.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">[Freight] rates on coal from
the
mines to the plant and on the treated coal from the plant to SLC were
the
basis for selecting the Carbon county site.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Type of Plant ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We propose to build a plant to
treat
one carload of coal per day. The coal is to be dumped into track
hoppers
on plant spur as shown in plant layout, then elevated to screen, sized
and thence taken to bins over retorts. The retorts to be charged by
weigh-lorry
on weigh. Retorts will drop treated coal into car which is drawn up
incline
over screen where coal is sized and delivered into finished bins from
which
it falls by gravity to railroad cars for shipping.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The building is a steel frame
with
corrugated iron roof and siding housing elevator, bins, retorts,
boiler,
generator, superheater, and condensers.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Process ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treating process in this
pilot
plant contemplates the treatment of 2" slack. This must be purchased
with
the understanding that it will contain the normal distribution of sizes
with not over 25% below 3/8". In this plant we will use the fines for
boiler
fuel. The superheater will be fired by gas formed by the distillation
of
the coal. The combustion chamber of this superheater is designed to
burn
either gas or fine coal fed by a stoker. The above percentage of fines
is ore than sufficient to take care of the plant fuel requirements.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The screens divide the dust
free
coal into three sizes of approximately equal amounts.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5,000 pounds of sized coal is
charged
into each of the retorts with the largest size forming the bottom third
of the charge, the second size forming the middle portion, and the
smallest
size forming the top third of retort charge. The retort is closed and
the
coal is then ready for treatment by low temperature carbonization.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The carbonization is affected
by
internal application of heat, superheated steam being the distilling
medium.
The superheated steam is derived from the boiler. After expanding the
steam
through the 50 kw turbo-generator it is passed through a separately
fired
superheater and thence into the top of the retort. From the top of the
retort the steam passes down through the charge thereby surrounding the
coal and heating all the lumps uniformly. The steam is delivered into
the
retort at temperatures between 900 degrees and 1400 degrees F, the
temperature
depending upon the yield and character of products desired. The steam
is
generated at 200 pounds pressure in the boiler and expands to 35 lbs
pressure
in passing through the turbine, and further expands to 10 lbs pressure
in the superheater and enters retort at this pressure.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The steam on passing through
the
charge distills the oil and gas from the coal, beginning at top of
charge
and passes continuously down to the bottom of the retort. The released
gas and oil vapors mix with the steam and pass down and out of the
retort
through bottom connections to the condensers. When the distillation
zone
has passed approximately 2/3 the way down from the top of the charge,
the
flow of superheated steam is diverted into another retort, and
saturated
steam becomes superheated on entering the highly heated toper of the
charge
and on passing down serves to transfer the heat down through the charge
and complete the distillation of the lower portion of the charge, thus
effecting economy in the use of superheated steam.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The hot volatiles and steam
coming
from the first retort, as the distillation zone approached the bottom,
are diverted into the base of a third retort containing a new charge of
coal, thus serving to preheat the fresh charge. The saturated steam
passing
into the top of the first retort simultaneously serves to cool the
distilled
coal. The flow of this steam is continued, however, after the
distillation
has been completed and until most of the sensible heat has been
transferred
into the charge of fresh coal in the adjacent retort. The cooled charge
of treated coal is now dumped from the first retort and a fresh charge
introduced. The superheated steam is now diverted from the second to
the
third retort whereupon saturated steam is introduced into the second
retort
and the issuing hot volatiles pass into the first retort to preheat the
fresh charge. Thus the cycle of preheating, distilling, and
dry-quenching
is continuous and with minimum consumption of fuel and superheated
steam.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above is a description of
the
ideal heat cycle but in the design and proposed operation of the pilot
plant we propose to simplify the plant by omitting a part of the cycle.
Since we will have an excess of fuel under the above plan of operation
of the pilot plant, there is no immediate necessity of extreme steam
economy.
Therefore we propose to cool the charge solely by the use of wet steam
which will be obtained largely from one of the condensers which
operates
on the evaporator principle. That is, as one charge is being distilled,
the previous charge will be undergoing dry-quenching as indicated
above.
Under this plan water may be atomized and carried with the steam into
the
charge being cooled. When the treated coal has been cooled to below 400
degrees F it will not ignite on exposure to air. After the charge is
cooled
it is dropped into car and taken to bins as described.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Equipment ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All equipment is described in
the
rough draft of specifications hereto attached. These specifications
give
sizes and general information but owing to limitation of funds for this
work they are not in sufficient detail to use in present form to
request
bids.</font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Basis of Design</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Superheater ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This unit was designed for a
capacity
of 1,500 lb of steam per hour superheating same from the temperature of
turbine exhaust at 35 lb to 1400 degrees F and 10 lb&nbsp; pressure.</font>
  </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Retorts ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The estimate includes one spare
retort,
a total of four, but three only are used simultaneously. Assume 40 tons
slack coal received. Ten tons of fines less than 3/8" to be used for
fuel
for process; 30 tons to be treated, each retort being charged four
times
in 24 hours. Retort capacity of untreated coal 5000 lb each; weight of
treated charge 3333 lb.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Time of Cycle ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(a) Superheated steam flows
through
charge for 3 hours (distilling)</font> <br>
  <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(b) Cooling steam flows through
charge about 2 hours (preheating and dry-quenching)</font> <br>
  <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(c) Discharging and charging, one
hour.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Total time of cycle, 6 hours.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The retorts to be of 1/2" steel
and
not lined in this pilot plant. The retorts are provided with a flexible
top and bottom support so as to allow for vertical and lateral movement.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The design and estimate also
provides
for corrosion resisting metals in the superheated steam lines and
valves.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apparatus has bee provided for
supporting
charge in retort during distillation to regulate compression of charge
and to assist in discharge of treated coal.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Condensers ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A steam-jacketed hot condenser
receives
the evolved gases and vapors directly from the retort and serves to
condense
the high boiling oil which are heavier than water. This condenser also
functions as an evaporator and produces a part of the cooling steam.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A second cold condenser
containing
water completes the condensation of the oils lighter than water and the
remaining steam.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two condensers function
together
as a means of readily separating the oil and water, the total crude oil
having a specific gravity approximately the same as water.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These two crude oil condensates
may
be combined or stored separately, depending on the products desired.</font>
  </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Power ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We contemplate using a 50 kw,
3600
rpm AC generator unit. The coiler steam at 200 lb pressure will be
expanded
through the steam turbine and exhaust at 35 lb pressure. This steam
then
enters the superheater and becomes the process steam for the coal
treating
operation. This 50 kw unit will thus utilize the steam required in
processing
the coal and will supply ample power for all of the pilot plant
requirements.</font> </p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">[Not include here ~ local

  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Refinery ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the building of this pilot
is
to obtain results, we recommend that it include a refinery to produce
the
finished oil products that can be marketed in Carbon County. Laboratory
results in the State and Federal investigation have proved conclusively
that good quality products can be obtained from the oil. A large part
of
the revenue must come from the refinery products and the main
justification
for this report and further consideration of the subject is the fact
that
the Utah coal fields are in reality one of the largest proven oil
fields
in the United States. A slight change in our economic conditions
affecting
oil markets favorably might easily make the results that may be
obtained
from this complete pilot plant of immense importance to the future of
Utah.
Further we believe that by placing the refinery at the plant the
operation
of this small pilot plant will be self-sustaining as shown by the
estimates,
and may therefore be prolonged to any desired length of time, thus
making
it possible to study the various phases of the problem, quality of
products,
markets, reaction of the public to the use of the smokeless fuel and
other
products, or community needs.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our estimate therefore includes
the
necessary equipment for a 20 bbl per day refinery. The yield of oil is
about 30 gal per ton of coal treated. The operation of this refinery
will
coordinate well with the operation of the treating plant, requiring
very
little additional labor.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note the only products for
revenue
considered in the estimates are treated coal, gasoline and kerosene.
There
are other products that will be produced in the refinery: One ton per
day
oil carbon; 15,000 cu ft of 1300 Btu gas; and about one bbl of cresols.
Ammonia gas or ammonium sulfate may also be obtained.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gas ~</font></b> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the details of the pilot
plant
operation have been perfected sufficiently, then steps should be taken
to connect the plant by gas lines to [towns]. This pilot plant will
provide
adequate 1000 Btu gas.</font> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Quality of Fuel Product ~</font></b>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to work done at

at Pittsburgh with the raw coal and with the treated coal from Utah,
showed
under a wide range of firing conditions an increased heating efficiency
from 10% to 30%. In other words, the treated coal will in no case give
as low heating efficiency (heat delivered to the house) as with raw
coal
and on an average, will give 20% more actual delivered heat.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The treat coal burns very much
like
anthracite but it is easily ignited and nis very satisfactory for
kitchen
ovens. It is an ideal fuel for fireplaces.</font> </p>
