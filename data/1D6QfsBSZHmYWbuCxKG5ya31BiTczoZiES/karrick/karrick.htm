    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America</b>
        has been called the Saudi Arabia of Coal because it contains 28%
        of Earth's known reserves, enough to last more than a thousand
        years. Coal accounts for 90% of our national energy reserves,
        but only 30% of our energy consumption. Coal is a logical target
        for a national effort to achieve energy independence. The
        environmental hazards of burning coal limits, however, its use
        in raw form. It is therefor urgent that we develop the
        production of synthetic liquid fuel from coal. America alone of
        the major industrial nations has increased its reliance on
        Middle East oil since the OPEC embargo of 1973.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early in 1980, President
          Carter gained Congressional approval of a $20 billion synfuel
          program including an Energy Mobilization Board to cut
          bureaucratic red tape and speed the approval of high-priority
          projects including plants to manufacture oil from coal and
          shale. The U.S. Department of Energy placed great emphasis on
          the Bergius process (direct liquefaction by hydrogenation) to
          produce synfuel. The Bergius process has been justly
          criticized by ecologists and economists; it is impossibly
          expensive, impractical, and dangerous, consumes a lot of
          water, and its waste products pose a grave threat to the
          environment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Bergius process combines
          heated hydrogen under 3000-5000 psi pressure with coal to
          produce oil. The synthesis requires about 7000 cu. ft.
          hydrogen per barrel of oil it produces, plus 1500 cu. ft. of
          hydrogen per 1000 cu. ft. of synfuel it produces.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is ironic that the major
          source of chemical hydrogen is natural gas. In terms of
          industrial chemical requirements and economics, natural gas
          has served this need well. But where hydrogen is considered as
          a means of conserving fossil fuels or producing synfuel, a
          much less costly and more abundant source must be sought. The
          logical choice is water, and an intensive search is underway
          to find economical ways of splitting that molecule to generate
          hydrogen and "hyfuel".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A far superior method exists
          to manufacture oil from coal. It is a little-known but very
          attractive, proven method called Low-Temperature Carbonization
          (LTC). The process was perfected by Lewis C. Karrick, an oil
          shale technologist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines in the 1920s.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">LTC is a pyrolysis process
          that involves heating coal, shale, lignite, or any other
          carbonaceous material, including garbage) to about 800<sup>o</sup>
          F. in the absence of oxygen. Oil is thus distilled from the
          material, rather than burning as it would if oxygen were
          present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After treatment by the
          Karrick process, a ton of coal will yield up to a barrel of
          oil, 3000 cu. ft. of rich fuel gas, and 1500 lb. of solid
          smokeless char (semi-coke). The economics of the process are
          such that the oil is obtained for free! The smokeless char is
          an excellent substitute for coal in utility boilers, and for
          coking coal in steel smelters. It yields more heat than raw
          coal, and it can be converted to water gas. That gas can be
          converted to oil by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis-process. The
          coal gas produced by Karrick-LTC yields more BTUs than natural
          gas because it contains a greater amount of combined carbon,
          and there is less dilution of the combustion gases with water
          vapor. The phenolic wastes are used by the chemical industry
          as feedstock for working up into plastics, etc.. The process
          produces no pollutants other than carbon dioxide.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electrical energy can be
          co-generated at minimal cost, in addition to coal products. A
          Karrick-LTC plant with a daily capacity of 1000 tons would
          produce enough steam to generate 100,000 KW-hours of
          electrical power at no extra cost other than the capital
          investment in electrical equipment and steam temperature
          losses in the turbines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No such claims can be made
          for any other coal or shale oil project in practice or theory.
          Nor can anyone demonstrate any other process that is
          manufacturing oil, gas, and semi-coke from coal commercially
          and without government subsidy, as is was done in England by
          the National Coal Carbonizing Co., Ltd. For 40 years, until
          the NCCC became catastrophically involved in North Sea oil in
          the 1970s, the company operated five LTC retorts producing
          Rexco-brand smokeless fuel (plus oil and gas) for use in
          England's official clean air zones. Other LTC plants have been
          operated in Estonia and a few other countries, but they are
          obsolete or are over-managed (as in India).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lewis Cass Karrick did not
          invent LTC of coal; he perfected it. In America before 1860,
          more than 50 plants were extracting oil and gas from coal.
          Boston had five LTC plants that produced oil and gas for heat,
          light, axle grease, and paraffin. But by 1873, the surfeit of
          Rockefeller's then-cheap petroleum had forced the last
          coal-oil plant to shut down. Free enterprise could revive the
          art, for the Karrick process is most amenable to private
          enterprise initiative. Oiligarchists fear this possibility and
          have very nearly entirely suppressed this elegant technology.
          According to Webster, suppress means "to keep from public
          knowledge --- to refrain from divulging."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1926, Secretary of
          Commerce Herbert Hoover (who later became President) made
          Karrick custodian of the government's coal-oil research data.
          Hoover advised Karrick to file patents, thus rendering the
          broadest public service and giving the government full credit.
          Sixteen patents were issued to Karrick outright. One, covering
          the underground distillation and gasification of coal and oil
          shale, was held jointly with brother Samuel, and another with
          Douglas Gould. All of the patents have expired since then.
          Karrick died in 1962. The patents now are in the public
          domain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As soon as Karrick and his
          associates proved they could produce oil from coal cheaper
          than the oil wells could pump it (plus gain major yield of gas
          and semi-coke), the government stopped all work on the
          processes at the pilot plants in Rifle, Colorado, and
          dismantled them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why? The major companies
          that mined coking coal for use by the steel-smelting industry
          pressured the Bureau of Mines to suppress Karrick's LTC
          process. It was feared that the cheap semi-coke char would
          replace coking coal and thus devalue hundreds of thousands of
          acres of coking-coal reserves, held by the coal-mining
          industry and worth billions of dollars. Coking coal cannot be
          used for LTC processing because it agglomerates upon heating
          and plugs the retort. Coking-coal comprise less than 5% of our
          national coal reserves and are in short supply. The other 95%
          are non-coking coals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1926, Germany's I.G.
          Farben chemical combine announced the invention of the Bergius
          process for making synthetic liquid fuel from coal by
          hydrogenation. But as Farben's president explained to a
          committee of the Reichstag, "The field of petroleum industry
          is so tremendous, and is so absolutely under the command of
          three large concerns, that the consideration of a new
          production in the fight against these concerns would have been
          very difficult... and the financial needs... beyond any
          expectation." The German corporate directorate concluded that
          in order to ensure the development of the Bergius process,
          their best course of action was to cooperate with Standard
          Oil.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After months of talks
          between Karrick and patent broker Leo Ranney (and on the very
          day in 1929 that Standard Oil announced that it had paid $35
          million for the Bergius process), SO officials tendered
          Karrick the positioned of vice-president and chief engineer,
          plus 1/3 of the stock in a chartered subsidiary entitled Oil
          &amp; gas Development Company. In exchange, Karrick was to
          relinquish control of his patents and supporting data. Thus,
          the oil cartel was on the verge of controlling both methods of
          converting coal into oil: Bergius hydrogenation and Karrick
          LTC.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Federal anti-trust lawyers
          advised Karrick not to sign with Standard Oil. They believed
          that the cartel intended to suppress his patents until they
          had expired and the country had run out of oil. Only then
          would they implement Karrick's LTC technology, particularly
          the underground gasification of coal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Karrick was advised to
          return to Utah to teach and develop his methods at the
          University of Utah. He founded the Utah Research Foundation
          for the endowment of the University of Utah, and several
          student theses were written about the research they developed.
          In 1934, one of Karrick's students, S. Clark Jacobson,
          received the Mechanical Engineering Honor for the best
          undergraduate thesis of the year, bestowed by the Utah Chapter
          of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The thesis,
          co-authored with George Carter, was abstracted in several
          scientific and industrial journals. <b>(1)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So-called experts have
          criticized that a commercial-scale plant designed according to
          the principles established by Karrick would not be practical
          or mechanically feasible. Yet in fact, no difficulty
          whatsoever was encountered with the successful operation of
          the pilot plant built by Karrick and his students at the
          University of Utah, as they showed in their graduate theses.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A witness for the Bureau of
          Mines told the Senate Interior Affairs Committee that the
          Karrick retort is fundamentally different in construction and
          operation from any other design. The retort was used to
          process large amounts of bituminous material, and appeared to
          have the best record of performance of any available retort
          that had been developed. Every variety and mixture of shale
          available was used, and all types of charges were retorted
          successfully. The last run was made with the worst coking
          shale available. Although two-thirds of the spent shale was in
          the form of large clinkers, the retort was discharged easily.
          The KLTC retort is self-cleaning, has no moving parts, is
          automated, and is continuous feeding. <b>(2)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is further possible to
          make watergas in the Karrick retort. The LTC char is
          especially well suited for the purpose. In other LTC
          processes, the feedstock must be brought to an incandescent
          state in a separate operation. The charge in a Karrick retort
          is in an incandescent state at the end of a run, and means of
          removing the water-gas are an integral part of the design.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1947, after completing
          commercial-scale runs on Appalachian coal, Karrick presented
          the Keynote address to the Convention of the Ohio Society of
          Professional Engineers. He said, "Great coal-oil and shale-oil
          industries have existed and do now exist in foreign countries,
          and many successful plants have existed in the state of Ohio
          and other states. Recent studies have shown that oil from
          coals of Ohio can be manufactured by distillation, not
          hydrogenation, at less than the average price of petroleum."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ohio bituminous coal then
          was selling for $3.50/ton, and natural crude was selling at
          the Persian Gulf for 34 cents per barrel, and domestic crude
          for around $2.53. The economics of the Karrick process were
          such that he was able to claim:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If the solid smokeless fuel
          residue from the LTC process was assumed to sell at the same
          price as the average price of prepared sizes of raw coal, then
          the cost of the crude oil would be zero dollars per barrel.
          This condition now exists in Ohio, and there can be made
          available plenty of low-cost fuel, excellently suited for
          domestic uses and industrial plants as a by-product of the
          manufacture of oil from coal. Also, the gas made from coal by
          these distillation methods is of about the same heating value
          as average natural gas."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The economic claims for LTC
          coal-oil processes have been demonstrated on a commercial
          scale in England by the National Coal Carbonizing Co., Ltd.,
          which manufactured the Rexco brand of char in its Snibston
          plant at Coalsville, Leicestershire. The NCCC developed five
          LTC plants in Scotland and England, producing smokeless fuel
          for industrial and domestic use in England's official
          clean-air zones. The highly-efficient plants carbonized 1,000
          tons of coal daily, 750 tons of which a recovered as smokeless
          char. The NCCC's 35-ton capacity retorts also produced 3
          million cubic feet of fuel gas and between 650-700 barrels of
          oil daily. No smoke or odor were discernible. The tars and
          phenol wastes were sold to the chemical industry as feedstock
          for plastics. The Rexco process was patented by Wallace, and
          is not to be confused with that of Karrick.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conveying and processing
          part of the plant involves the services of three men and a
          supervisor per shift. All were easily trained from scratch.
          Adding a few more retorts in line would not require any
          additional personnel. NCCC's Snibston plant originally was
          designed for six retorts, but the sixth was not installed
          because the British government limited NCCC's coal
          allocations. Unfortunately, NCCC became involved in Britain's
          North Sea oil project and was forced to cease its LTC
          operations in the 1980s due to political and economic
          machinations. The coampany's coal gasification plant now is a
          toxic cleanup site.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The official DOE position on
          LTC maintains the lie that "about 50% of the energy in feed
          coal remains in the total residue or char, and this residue is
          no better than the original." If the char is no better than
          the original coal, then why is it that in Britain's industrial
          centers, where the burning of non-smokeless fuel is
          prohibited, birds and plants that have not been seen for 100
          years have returned?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The DOE and oiligarchists
          discourage private enterprise and venture capital by issuing
          absurd, false statements about the technical and economical
          feasibility of Karrick's LTC technology. The DOE has
          suppressed the truth about the commercial capability of KLTC
          and its environmental advantages. Meanwhile, the major oil
          companies have been subsidized with billions of dollars to
          hydrogenate coal, even though the Bergius process and its
          variations will cost the public at least twice as much per
          barrel as OPEC charges.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Enter Harlan Trott, who for
          more than 20 years was a staff member of the <i>Christian
            Science Monitor</i>. He also served as chief of the<i> CSM</i>'s




          San Francisco bureau,. His articles also have appeared in such
          journals as <i>The American Banker</i>, <i>The London
            Observer</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, and others. Harlan
          Trott met Lewis Karrick in 1949:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Mr. Karrick was calling our
          home office, protesting and claiming that the Bureau of Mines
          was suppressing this technology, this cheaper and more
          efficient method to produce coal-oil. The editors picked me to
          talk with Mr. Karrick and see if we could sort out the facts.
          I thought it wouldn't take very long to do this, so I made
          arrangements for Mr. Karrick to come into the office around
          3:30 in the afternoon there in Washington. I figured he'd be
          out of the way by four o'clock and I'd get ahead of the crowd
          going home to Alexandria. Mr. Karrick came in at the appointed
          time and we started talking. And then I suddenly noticed the
          city lights had come on and the office was deserted. We
          discovered it was about eight o'clock. I had been spellbound
          by this story he had to tell about oil from coal and the way
          he alleged it had been suppressed. We went out and had a quick
          bite to eat and came back to the office and talked until about
          11:30 that night. And then I made a report, evaluated and
          sorted out the information, and suggested to the editors that
          we write a story about it. So the <i>Monitor </i>gave me
          about three months to concentrate and dig into this thing from
          all angles, and then we went to press and came out with a
          full-page copyright story in the March 20, 1950 issue of the <i>Christian




            Science Monitor</i>."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The perceptive and
          challenging story aroused so much attention and controversy,
          the Bureau of Mines felt obliged to publish a 5,000-word
          statement, full of misinformation, in which emphatic mention
          was made of the supposed "high cost of first producing the
          high-temperature steam to be used in carbonizing the coal and
          then condensing it to recover the tar product."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On May 12, 1950, two months
          after the publication of Trott's article, Lewis Karrick set
          the record straight when he testified at a Congressional
          hearing on the future use of the Minnesota peat bogs as an
          energy resource:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The simple and relatively
          inexpensive processes developed by me in the government
          service during the 1920s were designed for use as adjuncts to
          steam power plants so that there would be no need to invest
          new capital to produce steam. The LTC process would use
          off-peak steam from the power plant.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When you heat coal just to
          the temperature we call 'destructive distillation', oils form.
          If you don't let the temperature rise above that point, which
          is the same temperature used in cracking petroleum (700<sup>o</sup>-800<sup>o
          </sup>F.), you get oil from coal, not tar."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If the Bureau of Mines
          recognized this as oil instead of appearing dumb and calling
          it tar, then it should have been developed under the Synthetic
          Liquid Fuels Act. We can crack it into 50-odd percent
          gasoline, which is very good gasoline. It is better oil than
          you can get out of shale oil. It gives you as much oil per ton
          and gives you valuable by-products of smokeless fuel, which
          makes it cheaper than shale oil. So by not calling it oil,
          which it is if shale-oil is oil, its development has been
          obstructed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The present Bureau of mines
          won't recognize this cheap source of oil. They will spend vast
          sums of money on the German methods, but not a cent on
          distilling oil out of coal by the way we made oil in the U.S.
          once.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In fact, all the oil in the
          U.S. was made out of coal up to the time of the first oil well
          in 1859. There were 55 companies at one time, all listed in
          one of our government publications, manufacturing all of the
          oil used in the U.S., and it was not coal tar, it was oil!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When I was in the shale oil
          work and had the title of shale oil technologist for the
          bureau of Mines, we estimated that we could distill the oil
          shales underground and produce oil for a good deal less than a
          dollar a barrel, or if we used either of the two commercial
          plants that we built at Rifle, Colorado (1920-1926), we could
          make oil for $1.50 or $2 a barrel with either of those
          processes. Those are the figures, and we can prove it now.
          Since then, I have directed research at the School of Mines
          and Engineering in Utah for 8 years to prove these things, to
          offset information put out by the Bureau of Mines and others
          to the effect that you can't do it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Capital costs would be
          somewhere around $2,000 to $2,500 per ton of daily capacity,
          present prices [1950]. When we first figured this back in the
          Bureau of Mines, way back in 1927 to 1930 when we finished
          this study, it was as low as $800.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Rocky Mountain coals... all
          yield from 35 to 45 gallons of oil per ton. You could get from
          2,000 to 2,700 cubic feet of gas out of it, but we learned to
          heat until just the last trace of oil is out. Then it can't be
          made to smoke under any conditions. It burns with a very long,
          clear blue flame. The gas yields can be varied. The more gas
          you drive out of this smokeless fuel, the lower the BTU of the
          gas; so you can boost it up to 6,000 cubic feet of 800 BTU gas
          per ton of coal processed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Then it was demonstrated
          that all of the solid smokeless fuel could be made into
          water-gas. In that case you could get about 40,000 cubic feet
          of 300 to 350 BTU gas from a ton of processed coal. And out of
          that water-gas you could make four barrels of oil by the
          Fischer synthesis process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If you use some other gas
          such as hydrogen, rather than steam to distill oil from coal,
          that gas will be permanently mixed with the gas you make from
          coal and will make the new gas very low in BTU's and probably
          not salable. If you were to use a gas in place of steam, it
          would take power to compress the gas to force it to circulate
          through the coal. The power used to compress the hydrogen
          probably will be steam, and you would use nearly as much steam
          just to circulate the gas as you would if you used steam in
          the first place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The thing to do is to
          distill the oil out of the coal, while making a smokeless fuel
          and high-BTU gas. In a national crisis you would quickly go to
          converting this reactive, solid smokeless fuel to oil... Those
          who have been using this smokeless fuel (i.e., industries and
          power plants) will then go to burning raw coal for the
          duration of the emergency. That's the way we think the
          national fuel economy ought to be handled..."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And yet, even after such
          explicit and unarguable testimony, the Bureau of Mines refused
          to change its position which defines coal-oil as tar.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Harlan Trott's article in
          the <i>Christian Science</i> <i>Monitor</i> was read by
          Hubert Humphrey, then freshman Senator from Minnesota. In
          testimony at a Congressional hearing on July 13, 1950,
          Humphrey stated that he had read Trott's article and discussed
          it with eminent scientists at the University of Minnesota and
          at the School of Mines at Rapid City, South Dakota. Humphrey
          said that he had come to be dissatisfied with the attitude
          which the Bureau of Mines held toward the Karrick LTC process:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Mr. Karrick believes that
          the merits of his cheap, domestic oil-from-coal process are
          unlikely to interest oil companies, or the Department of the
          Interior for that matter, until the companies run out of
          sources of cheap foreign oil."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shortly after the <i>Monitor





          </i>published Trott's article about the Karrick process, Trott
          received a hand-written note from Watson Snyder, the Justice
          Department's chief oil investigator, saying:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The world oil cartel
          prevents the cheap production of oil from coal as it might
          bring about a reduction in prices in the U.S."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1952, the governmental
          suppression of the truth about the Karrick process
          precipitated a crisis of confidence within the Bureau of
          Mines. In an effort to clarify the technical controversy over
          the relative merits of hydrogenation and LTC of coal, Dr.
          Eugene Ayres (Director of Research of the Chemical Division of
          Gulf Oil and the foremost fuel economist on President
          Eisenhower's cartel-stacked Paley Commission) was invited to
          address 30 members of the Bureau of Mines coal research staff
          over dinner at the Cosmos Club in Washington DC. Dr. Ayres
          proceeded to refute every point of the Bureau's position
          against Karrick's work in no uncertain terms:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The hydrogenation of coal
          is unnecessary and too expensive in terms of dollars and coal,
          and the process uses much precious water. About half of the
          thermal value of coal is destroyed in the Bergius process.
          Hydrogenation need not be used to any large extent in the
          future because there exist simple, continuous LTC techniques
          (such as the Bureau of Mines developed) in which moderate
          yields of oil are accompanied by major yield of char
          (smokeless fuel). The oil can be converted to liquid fuels
          while the char is an excellent fuel for steam boilers in
          electrical generating plants. The Karrick-LTC method ---
          including the conversion of oil to motor fuel --- destroys
          only 25% of the thermal value --- half as much as the Bergius
          hydrogenation process."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to Dr. E.R.
          Mellinger, a leading expert on LTC, the Karrick process has a
          cyclic efficiency higher than 90%.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1933, Germany imported
          85% of its oil, but Hitler then instituted the most intensive
          synfuel program ever attempted. By the end of the WW2, Nazi
          Germany produced 75% of its own fuel by means of both the
          Bergius process and LTC of coal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Harlan Trott located
          documents recording the opinion of Dr. Adolf Thau, Germany's
          leading synfuel expert. In 1945, Dr. Thau told Dr. Frank Reed
          of the U.S. Technical Oil Mission, which went to Germany to
          study the Nazi's synfuel technology, that the Bergius process
          was "very expensive and accident-prone due to hydrogen
          explosions... Based on the coal introduced, only a very small
          amount of oil was obtained. Far better results were obtained
          by the simpler LTC methods." Dr. Thau produced a copy of a
          statement made in 1944 by British Minister of Fuels David
          George, disclosing that "oil from coal produced at home during
          the war had displaced fuel oil to a large extent in Great
          Britain... Further development of LTC is expected by the coal
          industry as a result of the experiences gained during the war,
          while the prospects for the hydrogenation of coal are judged
          less positively." Dr. Thau told Dr. Reed that, "The facts
          stated by the British government are fully confirmed by the
          experience gained in Germany."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Despite all the facts to the
          contrary, the DOE assiduously ignores the Karrick LTC process:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A major emphasis... is
          being placed on the hydrogenation of coal because [the DOE
          believes] this type of process can produce the maximum yield
          of liquid fuel products. Hydrogenation promises to be the most
          efficient and economical means of making synfuel..."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Federal government built
          a $10 million, 30,000 barrel/day pilot plant to test the
          Bergius hydrogenation process, but the Secretary of the
          Interior ordered the plant dismantled in 1953, saying it was
          "useless to keep trying to get more than a quart of water in a
          quart jar." Yet again, in 1978, Congress awarded a $75 million
          grant to Gulf Oil Company for development of the Bergius
          process, which cannot be made to stand on its own financial
          feet. Much more public money has been wasted on the same folly
          since then. Oiligarchists insist that the public must
          subsidize the program, which only the largest corporations are
          sophisticated, experienced, and foolish enough to exploit in
          this pork-barrel fashion. The oil cartel finds it easy and
          profitable to obtain Federal funds for the Bergius process,
          rather than institute the free Karrick-LTC technology.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During an interview with
          this writer in March 1980 at radio station KPFA (94.1 FM,
          Berkeley CA), Harlan Trott said:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You see, the threat here,
          to the oil cartel, is decentralization. Karrick-LTC lends to
          independent local control. Any co-op in this country wherever
          there's a coal mine can do this. In effect, every coal tipple
          can be an oil well."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To illustrate the point, Mr.
          Trott told of a group of merchants in Sydney, Australia, who
          cooperated during World War 2 to make shale oil to supply
          their needs. Australia was then on strict gasoline rationing.
          The group selected the Karrick-LTC process and purchased for
          $10,000 the 30-ton capacity retort developed by Karrick for
          the Santa Maria Railroad at Casmalia, CA. The group began
          distilling oil from shale near Sydney, and they were so
          successful that they installed two more retorts without
          employing extra help. The co-op also developed adapters to
          allow the use of shale-oil on their fleet of trucks. In
          England today, some trucks are operated by char-fueled steam
          power at one-fourth the cost of gasoline. During the 1930s,
          Karrick's students at the University of Utah drove their cars
          on gasoline made from coal in their campus pilot plant..</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1979, one of Karrick's
          students, Biard Anderson, was interviewed on a tv program at
          the NBC studio in Salt Lake City. The moderator asked, "Do you
          envision this [Karrick-LTC] process being used in conjunction
          with power generating plants?" Anderson replied:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I can see that somebody
          like Utah Power and Light could take coal on its way to the
          generating plant, process and take the oil and gas out, and
          then send the smokeless coal on, and burn that. And I believe
          that they could sell the oil and gas at a profit. In other
          words, it could be that they can't afford to burn the raw coal
          anymore."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lewis Karrick's patents have
          expired and now are in the public domain. They can be used by
          anyone, and no one can monopolize them. The process is
          relatively cheap, and does not need to be subsidized. The
          construction of a Karrick-LTC plant would cost only a quarter
          as much as a Bergius hydrogenation plant. Yet the technology
          lies utterly dormant today, no thanks to its suppression by
          oiligarchists.</font> </p>
