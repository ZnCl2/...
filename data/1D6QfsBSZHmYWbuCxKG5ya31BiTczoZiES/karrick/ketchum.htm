              Coal by the Karrick Plant</font></i></b>

              Committee</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>October 28, 1932 </p>
      <p>As per your verbal request at your meeting March 30, 1932, we
        are submitting the following report relative to plans and
        estimates for a pilot plant to treat coal by the Karrick
        Process. </p>
      <p>You will recall that under our instructions we were to make a
        study of the possibility of building a pilot treating plant for
        the sum of $50,000 mentioned at the meeting as an approximate
        total cost of said plant. With this figure in mind we proceeded
        with the work, Mr Grover Wardrop doing the designing with the
        close supervision of Mr Karrick and with such assistance as I
        could render. Also Mr C. N. Stutz and Mr Wm. Larson, senior
        civil engineering students assisted materially in compiling data
        and in computations, and their thesis now in the Engineering
        Library at the University of Utah is a valuable treatise on this
        subject. We also refer you to the thesis by Mr Schmutz of the
        School of Business on the oil reserves and oil shales of Utah,
        which is now in the University library. During the time that Mr
        Wardrop worked on this project, Mr Karrick carried on further
        coal tests in the laboratory at the University, and was assisted
        by Dr C.R. Kinney of the Chemistry Department, verifying and
        demonstrating the various steps of the process of various Utah
        coals. Arrangements were thus made for Mr Karrick and Mr Wardrop
        to have close contact throughout the work. </p>
      <p>This report includes the following drawings: [Drawings not
        included here; they were too pale to photocopy (at the
        University of Utah Special Collections)] Location Plan ~ General

        Plat. </p>
      <p><b>Smoke Elimination for Salt Lake City ~</b> </p>
      <p>No arguments need be given relative to the economic importance
        of smoke elimination for Salt Lake City. The exodus of many of
        our best citizens from Salt Lake in recent years because of the
        intolerable smoke condition in the minter months makes it
        imperative that a complete solution of this problem be effected
        at once if we are to maintain even normal growth for our city.
        We have gas for those who can afford it, we have stokers for
        some residences and apartment houses, but we still have smoke
        produced by kitchen ranges, heating stoves and hand-fired
        furnaces to such an extent that already in 1932 the familiar
        black blanket of dense smoke has appeared, much to the disgust
        of everyone. No one who can afford to move out will live here
        under such conditions. </p>
      <p><b>Present Heating &amp; Cooking Equipment in SLC ~</b> [ Table
        not included here ] </p>
      <p>The obvious conclusion from the above data is that a suitable
        solid smokeless fuel must be provided if the smoke cloud is to
        be eliminated. </p>
      <p>To build a pilot plant for the treatment of Utah coals, and to
        run such a plant for a year or two, we believe, would contribute
        largely to the solution of SLC’s smoke problem and add valuable
        information toward the development of Utah’s greatest resource.
        A slight change in the market favoring better prices for coal,
        oil and gasoline would at once make this type of development
        very attractive. The cost per ton capacity for this small pilot
        plant is high and the labor cost is high, but the capacity could
        be doubled at comparatively small cost and we believe the
        operation would then be more economical. However, we have
        confined this report to a pilot plant of smallest practical
        capacity to represent commercial operations. This was done in
        order to keep within your instructions as nearly as possible,
        and to determine facts that might guide us later in the design
        of a large commercial plant. We do not believe it practicable to
        design a large commercial plant until a pilot plant is run long
        enough to ascertain all the facts. We know of no other way to
        get these facts. </p>
      <p>It is likely that Utah coal fields will eventually be large
        users of power, and this power could be a by-product of this
        process of treating coal in Carbon County. The large amount of
        gas thus produced could be converted into power and the gas also
        used in the mining towns and for future industries. </p>
      <p>In view of the importance of the experiment to the State of
        Utah, we recommend that steps be taken to finance such a plant
        as is herewith described. </p>
      <p>In conclusion we wish to state that this report could not have
        been prepared without the help of Mr Karrick, who has furnished
        practically all the data relative to the process. </p>
      <p>This is the first attempt to make plans and specifications for
        a commercial sized coal plant using the Karrick process. </p>
      <p><b>Location of Plant ~</b> </p>
      <p>After preliminary studied of the possible sites for the plant
        it soon became apparent to us that the proper place to build
        such a plant is in Carbon County near the mines. </p>
      <p>[Freight] rates on coal from the mines to the plant and on the
        treated coal from the plant to SLC were the basis for selecting
        the Carbon county site. </p>
      <p><b>Type of Plant ~</b> </p>
      <p>We propose to build a plant to treat one carload of coal per
        day. The coal is to be dumped into track hoppers on plant spur
        as shown in plant layout, then elevated to screen, sized and
        thence taken to bins over retorts. The retorts to be charged by
        weigh-lorry on weigh. Retorts will drop treated coal into car
        which is drawn up incline over screen where coal is sized and
        delivered into finished bins from which it falls by gravity to
        railroad cars for shipping. </p>
      <p>The building is a steel frame with corrugated iron roof and
        siding housing elevator, bins, retorts, boiler, generator,
        superheater, and condensers. </p>
      <p><b>Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>The treating process in this pilot plant contemplates the
        treatment of 2" slack. This must be purchased with the
        understanding that it will contain the normal distribution of
        sizes with not over 25% below 3/8". In this plant we will use
        the fines for boiler fuel. The superheater will be fired by gas
        formed by the distillation of the coal. The combustion chamber
        of this superheater is designed to burn either gas or fine coal
        fed by a stoker. The above percentage of fines is ore than
        sufficient to take care of the plant fuel requirements. </p>
      <p>The screens divide the dust free coal into three sizes of
        approximately equal amounts. </p>
      <p>5,000 pounds of sized coal is charged into each of the retorts
        with the largest size forming the bottom third of the charge,
        the second size forming the middle portion, and the smallest
        size forming the top third of retort charge. The retort is
        closed and the coal is then ready for treatment by low
        temperature carbonization. </p>
      <p>The carbonization is affected by internal application of heat,
        superheated steam being the distilling medium. The superheated
        steam is derived from the boiler. After expanding the steam
        through the 50 kw turbo-generator it is passed through a
        separately fired superheater and thence into the top of the
        retort. From the top of the retort the steam passes down through
        the charge thereby surrounding the coal and heating all the
        lumps uniformly. The steam is delivered into the retort at
        temperatures between 900 degrees and 1400 degrees F, the
        temperature depending upon the yield and character of products
        desired. The steam is generated at 200 pounds pressure in the
        boiler and expands to 35 lbs pressure in passing through the
        turbine, and further expands to 10 lbs pressure in the
        superheater and enters retort at this pressure. </p>
      <p>The steam on passing through the charge distills the oil and
        gas from the coal, beginning at top of charge and passes
        continuously down to the bottom of the retort. The released gas
        and oil vapors mix with the steam and pass down and out of the
        retort through bottom connections to the condensers. When the
        distillation zone has passed approximately 2/3 the way down from
        the top of the charge, the flow of superheated steam is diverted
        into another retort, and saturated steam becomes superheated on
        entering the highly heated toper of the charge and on passing
        down serves to transfer the heat down through the charge and
        complete the distillation of the lower portion of the charge,
        thus effecting economy in the use of superheated steam. </p>
      <p>The hot volatiles and steam coming from the first retort, as
        the distillation zone approached the bottom, are diverted into
        the base of a third retort containing a new charge of coal, thus
        serving to preheat the fresh charge. The saturated steam passing
        into the top of the first retort simultaneously serves to cool
        the distilled coal. The flow of this steam is continued,
        however, after the distillation has been completed and until
        most of the sensible heat has been transferred into the charge
        of fresh coal in the adjacent retort. The cooled charge of
        treated coal is now dumped from the first retort and a fresh
        charge introduced. The superheated steam is now diverted from
        the second to the third retort whereupon saturated steam is
        introduced into the second retort and the issuing hot volatiles
        pass into the first retort to preheat the fresh charge. Thus the
        cycle of preheating, distilling, and dry-quenching is continuous
        and with minimum consumption of fuel and superheated steam. </p>
      <p>The above is a description of the ideal heat cycle but in the
        design and proposed operation of the pilot plant we propose to
        simplify the plant by omitting a part of the cycle. Since we
        will have an excess of fuel under the above plan of operation of
        the pilot plant, there is no immediate necessity of extreme
        steam economy. Therefore we propose to cool the charge solely by
        the use of wet steam which will be obtained largely from one of
        the condensers which operates on the evaporator principle. That
        is, as one charge is being distilled, the previous charge will
        be undergoing dry-quenching as indicated above. Under this plan
        water may be atomized and carried with the steam into the charge
        being cooled. When the treated coal has been cooled to below 400
        degrees F it will not ignite on exposure to air. After the
        charge is cooled it is dropped into car and taken to bins as
        described. </p>
      <p><b>Equipment ~</b> </p>
      <p>All equipment is described in the rough draft of specifications
        hereto attached. These specifications give sizes and general
        information but owing to limitation of funds for this work they
        are not in sufficient detail to use in present form to request
        bids. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Basis of Design</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Superheater ~</b> </p>
      <p>This unit was designed for a capacity of 1,500 lb of steam per
        hour superheating same from the temperature of turbine exhaust
        at 35 lb to 1400 degrees F and 10 lb&nbsp; pressure. </p>
      <p><b>Retorts ~</b> </p>
      <p>The estimate includes one spare retort, a total of four, but
        three only are used simultaneously. Assume 40 tons slack coal
        received. Ten tons of fines less than 3/8" to be used for fuel
        for process; 30 tons to be treated, each retort being charged
        four times in 24 hours. Retort capacity of untreated coal 5000
        lb each; weight of treated charge 3333 lb. </p>
      <p><b>Time of Cycle ~</b> </p>
      <p>(a) Superheated steam flows through charge for 3 hours
        (distilling) <br>
        (b) Cooling steam flows through charge about 2 hours (preheating
        and dry-quenching) <br>
        (c) Discharging and charging, one hour. </p>
      <p>Total time of cycle, 6 hours. </p>
      <p>The retorts to be of 1/2" steel and not lined in this pilot
        plant. The retorts are provided with a flexible top and bottom
        support so as to allow for vertical and lateral movement. </p>
      <p>The design and estimate also provides for corrosion resisting
        metals in the superheated steam lines and valves. </p>
      <p>Apparatus has bee provided for supporting charge in retort
        during distillation to regulate compression of charge and to
        assist in discharge of treated coal. </p>
      <p><b>Condensers ~</b> </p>
      <p>A steam-jacketed hot condenser receives the evolved gases and
        vapors directly from the retort and serves to condense the high
        boiling oil which are heavier than water. This condenser also
        functions as an evaporator and produces a part of the cooling
        steam. </p>
      <p>A second cold condenser containing water completes the
        condensation of the oils lighter than water and the remaining
        steam. </p>
      <p>The two condensers function together as a means of readily
        separating the oil and water, the total crude oil having a
        specific gravity approximately the same as water. </p>
      <p>These two crude oil condensates may be combined or stored
        separately, depending on the products desired. </p>
      <p><b>Power ~</b> </p>
      <p>We contemplate using a 50 kw, 3600 rpm AC generator unit. The
        coiler steam at 200 lb pressure will be expanded through the
        steam turbine and exhaust at 35 lb pressure. This steam then
        enters the superheater and becomes the process steam for the
        coal treating operation. This 50 kw unit will thus utilize the
        steam required in processing the coal and will supply ample
        power for all of the pilot plant requirements. </p>
      <p><b>Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>[Not include here ~ local information, not pertinent] </p>
      <p><b>Fire Protection ~</b> </p>
      <p>[Not include here ~ local information, not pertinent] </p>
      <p><b>Refinery ~</b> </p>
      <p>If the building of this pilot is to obtain results, we
        recommend that it include a refinery to produce the finished oil
        products that can be marketed in Carbon County. Laboratory
        results in the State and Federal investigation have proved
        conclusively that good quality products can be obtained from the
        oil. A large part of the revenue must come from the refinery
        products and the main justification for this report and further
        consideration of the subject is the fact that the Utah coal
        fields are in reality one of the largest proven oil fields in
        the United States. A slight change in our economic conditions
        affecting oil markets favorably might easily make the results
        that may be obtained from this complete pilot plant of immense
        importance to the future of Utah. Further we believe that by
        placing the refinery at the plant the operation of this small
        pilot plant will be self-sustaining as shown by the estimates,
        and may therefore be prolonged to any desired length of time,
        thus making it possible to study the various phases of the
        problem, quality of products, markets, reaction of the public to
        the use of the smokeless fuel and other products, or community
        needs. </p>
      <p>Our estimate therefore includes the necessary equipment for a
        20 bbl per day refinery. The yield of oil is about 30 gal per
        ton of coal treated. The operation of this refinery will
        coordinate well with the operation of the treating plant,
        requiring very little additional labor. </p>
      <p>Note the only products for revenue considered in the estimates
        are treated coal, gasoline and kerosene. There are other
        products that will be produced in the refinery: One ton per day
        oil carbon; 15,000 cu ft of 1300 Btu gas; and about one bbl of
        cresols. Ammonia gas or ammonium sulfate may also be obtained. </p>
      <p><b>Gas ~</b> </p>
      <p>When the details of the pilot plant operation have been
        perfected sufficiently, then steps should be taken to connect
        the plant by gas lines to [towns]. This pilot plant will provide
        adequate 1000 Btu gas. </p>
      <p><b>Quality of Fuel Product ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to work done at Pittsburgh the following is a
        comparison of quality of raw and treated King Coal No. 1 mine: </p>
      <p>Quality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raw Coal&nbsp; Treated Coal <br>
        BTU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12750&nbsp;&nbsp;
        12500&nbsp; Loss 2% <br>
        Volatiles&nbsp;&nbsp; 43%&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% <br>
        Ash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.5%&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% <br>
        Combustion Efficiency 45%&nbsp;&nbsp; 60%&nbsp; Increase 33% </p>
      <p>Actual househeating studies made at Pittsburgh with the raw
        coal and with the treated coal from Utah, showed under a wide
        range of firing conditions an increased heating efficiency from
        10% to 30%. In other words, the treated coal will in no case
        give as low heating efficiency (heat delivered to the house) as
        with raw coal and on an average, will give 20% more actual
        delivered heat. </p>
      <p>The treat coal burns very much like anthracite but it is easily
        ignited and nis very satisfactory for kitchen ovens. It is an
        ideal fuel for fireplaces. </p>
