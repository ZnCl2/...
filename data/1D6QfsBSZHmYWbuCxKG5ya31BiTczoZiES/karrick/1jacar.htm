      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ashley (11) states that,
          "Cannel coal is a massive, non-caking, tough, clean block coal
          of fine, even, compact grain, dull luster, commonly conchoidal
          cross fracture, having a low fuel ration, a high percentage of
          hydrogen, easy ignition, long yellow flame, black to brown
          greasy streak, and moderate ash, which is pulvurent in
          burning. It is essentially a rock derived by solidification
          and partial distillation or oxidation of water-laid deposits
          consisting of or containing large quantities of plant spores
          and pollen grains and more or less comminuted remains of low
          orders of water plants and animals".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">David White (12, in writing
          about his microscopical study of the Utah cannel coal, says,
          "The fuel contains very little if any vestiges of the cell
          structures of higher plants, being made up largely of
          lemon-yellow, more or less lenticular, or globular,
          translucent bodies embedded in a brownish black groundmass of
          somewhat flocculent aspect. Some of the translucent matter is
          probably resinous, while it is possible that some of the
          lemon-yellow substance, less in quantity may be gelatinous,
          tough that is not at all certain. On the whole, the
          microscopical composition of the coal is essentially that of a
          high-grade cannel".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is generally accepted
          that bituminous coals resulted from woody materials whereas
          cannel coals appear to have been formed from decayed spores,
          pollen, leaves and the cuticle material from plants, thus
          these waxy ingredients account for the high oil yield which is
          possible from most cannel coals, being usually two to three
          times the yield from bituminous coals. The same organic
          constituents are largely responsible for the oil obtainable
          from oil shales.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cannel coal is adapted to
          the common uses of bituminous coals excepting coke
          manufacture. It is especially an ideal fireplace fuel and for
          a long period has been accepted as a "deluxe" fuel for this
          purpose. It is very clean to handle, attractive in appearance,
          ignites very easily, gives a cheerful, large, bright,
          orange-colored flame, and the ash is in pulvurent form. It
          burns without disintegration and therefore does not yield as
          much smoke as the common high volatile bituminous coals, thus
          making for a very popular domestic fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of the high volatile
          content and high candle power of the volatiles, cannel coal
          has been in use extensively in former years in the eastern USA
          for coal gas enrichment. In the early days in Utah, cannel
          coals and oil shale were imported from Australia for use in
          the first gas plant to increase the candle power of the city
          gas. The principal use of cannel coal in the USA in past years
          was for the production of oil for refining into the common oil
          products. As early as 1846 oil was manufactured from coals and
          in the year 1860, when the first reqal discovery of petroleum
          occurred, there were 55 coal-oil plants operating in the US,
          the largest having a distilling capacity of 6000 barrels of
          oil per day. Kerosene (coal oil), light lubricants, greases,
          and wax were the principal refined producrts, gasoline having
          no market value at that time. Most of the plants were in
          Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, although one large
          plant was in Boston. The principal cannel coal deposits are in
          Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio,
          Tennessee, Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Texas and Utah.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the visit to the cannel
          coal deposit in 1932 information was obtained by the writers
          showing that the coal deposit was sufficiently extensive and
          accessible to large markets by truck and rail to justify its
          early development. It was also concluded that because of the
          pronounced superiority of this coal as compared with all other
          local coals for domestic fuel and as a source of road oil and
          motor fuel -- that a need existed and an impetus could be
          given the development of this Utah resource if a study were
          made of the processing of the slack coal from the deposit.
          Consequently a study was planned of the heat requirements in
          treating this coal as well as an investigation of the products
          formed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Advantage was taken of the
          studies made of this coal in 1920 by the State of Utah and the
          Federal Government in which laboratory processing data were
          obtained (9) and by which excellent yields and quality of oil
          were obtained. The destructive distillation method used steam
          as the heat transferring fluid, the exhaust steam from power
          plant engines or turbines being superheated and then passed
          directly through bodies of sized, dust-free coal. This method
          [the Karrick LTC Process] (13) had subsequently been developed
          (5) for commercial uses and appeared to have many advantages,
          so it was adapted for the thesis study of the cannel coal. In
          designing the test apparatus the primary objects were to
          minimize radiated heat losses under all processing conditions
          and then take temperature and heat-flow data throughout the
          coal charges and the apparatus, thus permitting a correlation
          of products obtained with the most economical use of heat.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This coal treating method
          used is one of a group being offered to the Utah Research
          Foundation [by Lewis C. Karrick].</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the purpose of carrying
          out this investigation, a small distilling plant was
          constructed. Figures 2 and 3 are, respectively, a schematic
          plant layout and a photograph of the test setup.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The plant, Figure 2,
          consisted of a gas-fired superheater (a), a coal retort (b),
          and the condensers (c), (d), and (e).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The combustion chamber (f)
          of the superheater was constructed of common brick. Heating
          gas was supplied from the gas line through the control valve
          (g) an was measured in meter (h). The manometer (i) provided
          the operator with an instantaneous sight control of the volume
          of gas delivered to the two burners. These burners consisted
          of the nozzles (j) and the air and gas mixing tubes (k).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Above one end of the
          combustion chamber an supported from the wall by mean of a
          bracket, was the steam superheating coil consisting of
          approximately one hundred feet of 1/2" standard pipe formed
          into a coil 15" in diameter and 48" high. This coil was hung
          in the annular space between the cylindrical column (1) and
          the heat-insulating outer wall (m) so that the hot gases from
          the combustion chamber passed at high velocity over the coil
          counterflow to the steam. The outer wall was 4" thick and was
          comprised of two sheet metal casings filled with diatomaceous
          silica earth. This structure was supported on a frame work,
          about 10 ft above the floor. At the inlet to the insulating
          coil there were provided a steam gauge to show the pressure of
          the steam as it entered the coil, a steam-flow regulating
          valve, and a steam separator with a drain as shown on the
          drawing, Figure 2.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coal-distilling retort
          (b) consisted of a thin-walled cylinder (n) of 18-gauge black
          iron with welded seams, 5" in diameter and 8 ft high. On the
          top and bottom ends of the retort were welded 5" pipe
          couplings with screw plugs to serve as removable closures. At
          the top of the retort a flexible connection with the
          superheater was provided from a multiple-elbow assembly of
          1/2" fittings and nipples, thus relieving strains on the
          superheater and retort caused by changes of length with
          temperature. To further obviate any strains to the connection
          between the retort and superheater, the retort was made
          stationary by suspending it from a wall bracket with wires
          connected to arms welded to the top of the retort. Changes in
          length of the retort thus took place downwardly. Likewise a
          flexible multiple-elbow vapor outlet of 3/4" fittings was
          provided at the bottom of the retort leading into the
          condenser (c), this also preventing strains to the equipment
          due to thermal expansion. The retort was well-insulated
          against heat losses by surrounding the retort with a sheet
          iron jacket (o), spaced 6" from the retort and filling this
          annular space (p) with diatomaceous earth. The insulating
          material and jacket were supported 2 ft above the floor by a
          circular steel plate. The lower 4" of the retort and the vapor
          connections protruded through this plate allowing free
          vertical movement of the retort by thermal expansion and easy
          access to the lower retort plug for discharging the treated
          coal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The superheated steam
          connections from the superheater into the top of the retort
          were buried in the same insulating material up to the top of
          the 5" coupling. The remaining exposed portions of the retort
          and plug were buried under a layer of ground asbestos-magnesia
          insulating material which was removed while the retort was
          being charged. A low-pressure steam gauge (q) was screwed into
          the charging plug and served to indicate the back pressure in
          the top of the retort above the coal. The lower plug was not
          covered, the coal being supported well up within the insulated
          retort shaft.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Six thermocouples
          (abbreviated to TC on Figure 2) were placed in firm contact
          with the retort walls through holes in the retort casing at
          16" intervals, beginning at the bottom of the retort; also one
          thermocouple was inserted in the superheated steam connection
          at the top of the retort. The thermocouple leads were run to
          the selective switch board ® from which connections were made
          to the potentiometer (s).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vapors from the bottom of
          the retort were carried to the top of the condenser (c)
          through a vertical 3/4" pipe. The condensed vapors were
          removed at the drain provided, and the remaining vapors were
          then carried out from the top of the second tube of this
          condenser to the condensers (d) and (e).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Condenser (c) consisted of
          two vertical 2" pipes (t) 6 ft long, joined at their lower
          ends and containing a spiral metal ribbing which caused
          rotation of the vapor stream and impingement of condensed
          particles against the tube walls. Each pipe was surrounded by
          a steam jacket of 4" pipe with steam inlets, blow off,
          pressure gauge and valves for regulating the steam pressure,
          and therefore the temperature on the 2" tube walls. An oil
          drain was provided in the bottom of the connection between the
          two 2" tubes. This condenser thus provided a means of
          condensing out of the vapor stream only the high-boiling oil
          vapors while preventing any condensation of water vapor. By
          thus removing the high-boiling oils, which were found to be
          heavier than water, the remaining oils and water could be
          condensed together in another condenser and thence separated
          by decantation. Without this selective condensation this crude
          oil, which has approximately the same specific gravity as
          water, could have been separated from the water only with
          great difficulty.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Condensers (d) and (e)
          consist of two coils of 2" pipe placed in series occupying
          separate compartments in the condenser box (u). Cooling water
          flowed counter direction to the vapors being cooled, the
          condensate from condenser (d) being maintained above 70° F so
          as to prevent the waxy oil condensed from congealing and
          clogging the coils. The oil and water condensates of condenser
          (d) were drawn off under a liquid seal and the remaining
          vapors and gases were passed into condenser (e) surrounded by
          cold water so as to condense the light oils, the latter being
          collected in a container shown. The non-condensable gases were
          measured in the meter (v) and were then burned at torch (w).</font>

          sample of raw coal which had been previously sized was charged
          into the retort and the upper end of the retort closed and
          insulated with ground asbestos-magnesia material. The
          superheater fuel gas was then ignited and the superheater
          allowed to warm up. In the meantime, the steam separator drain
          was adjusted, condenser (c), Figure 2, was heated by raising
          its steam jacket pressure to 5 lb gauge, then condenser (d)
          was heated by bubbling steam into its cooling water in order
          to raise its temperature between 70° C and 80° C where it was
          maintained thereafter throughout the run by regulating the
          rate of flow of cooling water, and condenser (e) was cooled by
          turning cold water into its condenser box.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After containers had been
          placed under the condensate drains from each condenser, the
          meter (v) for registering generated gas flow was read and the
          retort temperatures were taken and recorded. The saturated
          steam was then admitted to the superheater at a pressure of 20
          psi. The meter (h) registering the flow of gas supply to the
          combustion chamber, was read simultaneously with the
          admittance of steam. The superheated steam pressure indicate
          by gauge (q) at the top of the retort was then read and all
          readings were taken and recorded at 15 minute intervals during
          the superheated steam period. This is the period during which
          superheated steam was being used for distilling the charge.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the beginning of each run
          a large volume of gas was supplied to the combustion chamber
          in order to obtain a rapid rise in the temperature of the
          superheated steam up to the predetermined distilling
          temperature (*1), and thereafter the gas supply was regulated
          at frequent intervals to maintain this temperature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(*1 ~ The final distilling
          temperature is the approximately constant temperature at which
          the superheated steam was maintained during the superheated
          steam period.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When generated fixed gases
          from the coal began issuing from the torch (w) they were
          ignited, the time was noted and meter (v) read. Condensed
          steam and the medium gravity oils were collected from
          condenser (d) in an oil separator, from which the water was
          driven off and measured for the duration of the superheated
          steam period.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The superheater gas supply
          was then shut off at either of the following two instants;
          first, at the time when the rate of evolution of the coal gas
          began to decline which accompanied a change of flame
          coloration from orange to light yellow, indicating nearly
          complete distillation of the charge; and second, the time at
          which it was estimated, by observing the rise of temperature
          indicated by the various thermocouples that the upper part of
          the retort and contents had reached a high enough temperature
          and contained enough heat to raise the lower portion of the
          retort to a temperature slightly above 360° C (the initial
          distilling temperature). It had proved that this final
          temperature would complete the distillation at the base of the
          charge and that it would be attained during the dry-quenching
          period and thus decrease the length of the superheated steam
          period.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Superheated steam of high
          initial temperature was used to cool the retort and its
          contents during the time designated as the "dry-quenching
          period", that is, the period in which steam was passed through
          the superheater and retort with the superheater fuel gas
          supply discontinued. Obviously, the residual heat within the
          superheater kept the steam superheated to some degree after
          the heating was stopped. This method of cooling was used in
          all runs except Test # 8 in which the retort and contents were
          cooled by the method set forth in the description for that
          test. The retort temperatures during the first part of the
          cooling period were read at 5 minute intervals in order to
          obtain more complete data on the rapid temperature changes
          that occurred during this time. Thereafter readings were taken
          every 15inutes as before. At the instant the evolution of
          generated fixed gases ceased, the time and meter (v) were
          read.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When all the thermocouples
          indicated temperatures throughout the retort approximating
          250° C the steam was shut off and the coal residue was dropped
          out of the retort by removing the lower retort plug. This
          temperature has been demonstrated to be sufficiently low to
          prevent ignition of the discharged residue. A few moments were
          allowed for the condensers (c), (d), and (e) to drain, then
          the oil condensates were mixed together and stored for further
          study.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each crude oil sample was
          distilled under pressure in a 2 gal still for the purpose of
          determining the water contained as emulsion in the crude oil.
          Thus the amount of dry crude oil was determined and recorded.
          Analytical distillation analyses have previously been made on
          the crude oil from this coal which had been produced by the
          same destructive distillation treatment, and consequently it
          was not necessary to make these analyses. However, the yield
          of crude oil and its properties were found to be identical in
          all the 8 runs and therefore a sample was subjected to a
          cracking and refining study. The distillation and cracking
          analyses determined from this sample are recorded herein. [Not
          included here]</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The thermal value of an
          average sample of the generated fixed gases taken during a
          typical test run was also determined.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Test Run # 1:</b> The
          retort was charged with 50 lb of coal sized to 1" to 1/2",
          which was distilled with superheated steam at 650° C (1202°
          F).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The accompanying temperature
          curves and operating data show that superheated steam first
          entered the retort at 244° C and was then raised to 650° C by
          the end of the first hour, whereupon its temperature was
          maintained substantially constant throughout the remainder of
          the "superheated steam period". By the end of this period,
          namely, 2 hours and 12 minutes, the formation of fixed gases
          had practically stopped, indicating that oil generation had
          practically ceased, whereupon the superheated steam was shut
          off.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this test run an
          investigation was made of the thermocouples and each was found
          to indicate the same temperatures immediately before and after
          the flow of steam was stopped. This proved that the couples
          were reading the true temperature of the retort and contents
          at each of the respective points throughout the length of the
          retort shaft. Couple 6 was out of service during this run.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The dry-quenching steam was
          then admitted into the top of the retort and its flow
          continued until all thermocouples indicated temperatures
          within the retort approximating 250° C. This preliminary run
          was made for the purpose of observing the operating
          characteristics of the retort and to obtain the accompanying
          data, so no heat economies in the use of superheated steam
          were attempted.</font> </p>

          probably from errors in observed exit steam temperatures. This
          amounts approximately to 4,000 Btu the heat imparted to the
          insulation, assuming the 2" layer of insulation next to the
          retort fluctuates about 500° F in heating and cooling, and is
          unaffected beyond a point 2" from the retort, also 2000 Btu
          lost by radiation. This total of 6000 Btu subtracted from the
          9910 Btu shown in the unaccounted for heat in the "Tabulated
          Results" for Test 6, still leaves 3910 Btu unaccounted for
          which must be the heat lost from the very high temperature
          surfaces at the top of the retort and probably errors in the
          observed temperatures of the discharged steam and volatiles.

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>General:</b> The purpose
          of the foregoing curves is to show the instantaneous
          temperatures and particularly the rate of change of
          temperature, of the superheated steam and the coal throughout
          the retort during the progress of the test runs. The
          thermocouples placed at regular intervals along the length of
          the retort, as previously described, are numbered from 1 to 6
          inclusive, the one at the vapor outlet being designated as #
          1. The temperature of the superheated steam as it entered the
          retort was determined by thermocouple # 7.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Except for the graph
          representing conditions of test # 8 in which the charge was
          preheated and finally dry-quenched with relatively
          low-temperature superheated steam, the curves herein presented
          are substantially of the same general shape (*1). Throughout
          all of the tests, it is interesting to note the consistent
          lagging of the temperature near 100° C, as indicated
          particularly by thermocouples # 1, 2, and 3 during the first
          part of the superheated steam period when the coal in the
          lower zones was being heated up by condensation of the steam,
          following this the subsequent rate of temperature increase as
          indicated by the slope of the curves, and then the crossing of
          the curves as the retort is cooled, ultimately resulting in
          reversing the final arrangement of the curves.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Coal Size vs Distilling
            Period:</b> Tests # 1 and # 5 show the influence of the size
          of coal on the length of time required for distillation at the
          same final distilling temperature. The charge used in Test #1
          was sized up to -1" to 1/2", and that used in Test # 5 to
          -1/2" to 1/4". Comparison of the distilling periods as
          indicated on the curves shows the period in #5, exceeding by 2
          minutes that in #1 in which the larger coal was used. This
          appears to be in a direction contrary to the expected results.
          However, it was observed that this cannel coal tended to
          fracture when it was crushed, into flat laminated pieces which
          were thin in section and yet large enough in the other
          dimensions to be withheld by a 1/2" mesh. Hence, the larger
          size of coal was usually no thicker in its smallest dimensions
          than the smaller size and will distill in like periods of
          time, also the pieces became porous with many small cracks
          parallel to the bedding plane which made them permeable to the
          superheated steam. This effect would not be measurable in
          treating coal lumps of much larger sizes. Also it should be
          noted that the distillation progressed down through the 8-ft
          column of coal, in both instances, at the rate of 1 ft in each
          10-minute interval. Or, if we consider the range of
          temperature within which the coal is distilled as 360° C to
          450° C, then in each instance the average period that the coal
          particle is undergoing distillation is 20 minutes. Previous
          work, however, has demonstrated that coal of the two sizes
          used will actually distill in less than 20 minutes, and
          therefore the distilling period is in these tests entirely
          governed by the rate of heat supply and not by coal particle
          size. With coal charges composed of lumps having minimum
          dimensions of 1" the effect of lump size on distilling rate
          would be important. Lumps 1" minimum diameter will require
          approximately 1 hr to distill and 2" lumps nearly 3 hr under
          the above conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Superheated Steam Periods
            vs Economy:</b> The charge used in Test # 5 was heated until
          after the end of the distilling period, while in Test # 6 the
          heating gas supply of the superheater was shut off before
          distillation was completed in an effort to use the steam most
          economically (note the length of superheated steam period in
          each case). An inspection of the curves for Tests # 5 and # 6
          shows that using the same final distilling temperature (650°
          C) and securing complete distillation in both cases, the
          superheated steam period was 20 minutes shorter in Test # 6 in
          which steam economy was practiced than in Test # 5. Obviously,
          then it is distinctly advantageous from the standpoint of
          economy to shut off the superheater gas supply before
          distillation is complete, since the same end conditions of
          distillation result. The practical application of the economy
          would be to divert the superheated steam into another retort
          at this moment. Curves for Tests # 2 and # 3 show a similar
          saving of superheated steam at a higher final distilling
          temperature (760° C).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Distilling Period vs
            Final Distilling Temperature:</b> Tests # 3 and # 4 were
          both run with an attempt to secure superheated steam economy,
          but different superheated steam temperatures were used, # 4
          being 535° C and # 3 being 760° C. By reference to the curves
          it is seen that the distilling period for # 4 at the lower
          temperature is 8 minutes longer than&nbsp; # 3. It will also
          be noted, however, that the rate of temperature increase as of
          thermocouple # 7, indicated by the slope of the curve, is much
          slower than in Test # 3 than in Test # 4. Hence if superheated
          steam had raised to its final temperature in equal periods of
          time, then, with the same flow of steam, the distilling period
          of Test # 3 at the higher distilling temperature would have
          been much further reduced. It may be concluded, therefore,
          that the higher superheated steam temperatures will decrease
          the length of the distilling period as well as the consumption
          of superheated steam.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Generation of Water Gas:</b>
          It was found in the runs using superheated steam at
          temperatures of 650° C and above, that large quantities of gas
          were generated, as may be seen by reference particularly to
          the data sheet of Test #3, the steam temperature of which was
          760° C. This gas was identified by the flame color and
          behavior in burning as blue water gas produced by the
          combination of the chemically reactive coal residue with the
          highly heated steam, in accordance with the following
          reactions:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">C / H<sub>2</sub>O = CO / H<sub>2</sub></font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">C / 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub>
          / 2H<sub>2</sub></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mixed with this gas was also
          some of the gas formed from the residual volatiles of the coke
          residue consisting of methane and hydrogen, also possibly some
          distillation gases.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Preheating Effects:</b>
          The curves for Test # 8 show that thermocouple (TC) # 1 and #
          2 reached a temperature of 135° C in 70 minutes while the
          preheating of the charge with superheated steam at 300° C was
          in progress. In Test # 3 made at 760° C the curves show that
          these TCs did not reach this same temperature until 55 minutes
          of the superheated steam period. Also in Tests # 2 and 7 made
          at 760 C at the end of 65 minutes of the superheated steam
          periods, these TCs indicated 250° C. It will be noted further
          that in dry-quenching the charges in all the various tests the
          lowest temperature reached by the steam leaving the retort, TC
          # 1, was approximately 250° C.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore it is obvious that
          by the proposed method of using this steam leaving the retort,
          during the dry-quenching period, for preheating a fresh coal
          charge in another retort, that much high-temperature steam
          would be saved. The superheated steam period was 70 minutes in
          Test # 8, 95 minutes in Test # 7, 85 minutes in Test # 2, and
          100 minutes in Test # 2. Had it been that the superheated
          steam used in Test # 8 was initially at 760° C, as would be
          the case in a commercial plant where the steam at constant
          temperature is diverted from one retort to the next, it is
          probable that the superheated steam period and the preheating
          period would each have been 60 minutes or less, making a total
          period of 120 minutes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are good evidences why
          the entire outflow of steam, oil vapors, and gases from the
          base of one retort should pass through the next retort of
          fresh coal enroute to the condensers, thus serving to preheat
          the new coal with both the exit superheated steam and the
          dry-quenching steam, and continuing until the new charge has
          stored within it the greatest quantity of heat. In the case of
          cannel coal, from which the coal residue will not have
          extensive market value because of its high ash content, the
          final cooling of the residue to a safe temperature for storing
          might be advantageously done by discharging it and spraying
          with water. This procedure serves to keep the retorts free for
          distilling purposes during the greatest percentage of their
          time, which would not be the case if they were used to serve
          as dry-quenching chambers. In the case of coals such as the
          Carbon County coals from which the smokeless fuel residue is
          the important product desired, the coke should be dry-quenched
          with steam in the retorts to the safe storage temperature,
          thus keeping the product physically dry. In this procedure,
          the dry-quenching steam might best be derived by recovering
          the sensible and latent heat of the volatiles issuing from one
          retort by condensing them in an evaporator type of condenser,
          the new low-pressure steam then being passed through the coal
          residue immediately following the diverting of the superheated
          steam into the next retort.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Distilling Graded Sizes
            of Coal:</b> As shown above, there was no reduction in time
          consumed in distilling the charges comprising the different
          sizes of cannel coal, this being because of the fact that the
          largest lumps used, mainly -1" to 1/2", actually required much
          less time to distill them than the time for the distilling
          heat wave (360° C to 450° C) to pass entirely through the
          retort from top to bottom. Had the lumps been over 1" in
          minimum dimensions a coal charge of the height, or even
          greater or less height, and with the same flow of steam, would
          have consumed more time. However, there is the practical
          consideration to be met as to the best way to effectively
          distill the maximum quantity of the slack coal at the proposed
          cannel coal mine. It would appear from the foregoing data that
          the slack coal should be screened to several sizes and these
          placed severally into the retort with the coarsest at the base
          and the finest dust-free size, say 1/4" to 1/8", at the top as
          applied in Test # 7. The size from dust up to 1/8" would then
          serve for stoker fuel under the boiler or for heating the
          separately fired superheater. In a stoker this high
          oil-yielding fuel should undergo combustion much like an oil
          fire. In the treatment of carbon slack the physical
          properties, crushing strength and insipient fusibility of the
          coal while undergoing distillation, requires that the retort
          charge be composed of stratified layers with the coarsest
          (strongest) lumps at the base of the charge so as to avoid
          crushing and yet compress slightly while improving the density
          and hardness of the smokeless product.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Retort Insulation &amp;
            Temperature Gradients:</b> Figure 4 shows the temperatures
          along the retort surface and at 6 equidistant points
          throughout the thickness of the insulating wall at the
          thermocouples positions shown in Figure 2. These measurements
          were taken during Test # 7 after the production of oil had
          ceased and the retort had therefore been receiving heat for
          approximately 1-1/2 hr. The temperature readings on the retort
          wall were taken after the flow of steam had been shut off.
          Each thermocouple starting with # 1 was read and then moved
          out 1" from the wall into the insulation. After # 7 was read a
          second reading was made of # 1 and it was then moved out
          another inch. Thus the measurements were taken out to and
          including the surface temperature of the insulating wall, the
          entire set of temperature readings requiring about 50 minutes.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is recommended that the
          temperature gradient through the wall at each thermocouple
          position should be a curve of logarithmic form if the
          temperature of the heat-receiving surface had been constant.
          This, however, was not the case since during the progress of
          the distillation al points along the retort had been gradually
          rising in temperature in accordance with the records shown in
          Test # 7 graphs. Consequently it may be stated that the points
          on each thermocouple curve above the abscissa, Figures 1 to 6,
          are instantaneous records of the temperature of the insulating
          material, which is the additive effect of an infinite series
          of heat impulses, of increasing potential, moving out through
          the insulating wall. Therefore the curve is steeper than if
          the temperatures had been stationary. The temperature of the
          outer surface will, of course, move up and down as the waves
          of heat pass down the retort in successive distillation tests.
          The figure shown on Figure 4 for the surface temperature was
          used in calculating the heat loss.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Yield of Products:</b> It
          will be observed by referring to the data on each sheet that
          the oil yield was the same in all instances within the range
          of possible experimental error in collecting the oil and its
          distillation to remove the contained water. It is logical to
          conclude that the yields actually were the same considering
          that the particles of coal throughout the charge experienced
          practically the same rate of rise of temperature in all tests
          while passing through the distillation range (360° C to 450°
          C). Although the contents of the retort were heated hotter in
          some tests, this occurred after the oil was removed and
          carried out of the retort. (Ref. 14)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The average yield of crude
          oil in this study was 64 gal per ton of coal; that reported by
          Allen 68.8 gal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The latter analysis was made

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An engineering investigation
          has been made of a valuable natural resource of the State of
          Utah, the cannel coal body in the Zion Canyon-Cedar Breaks
          area of southern Utah. The availablility of this undeveloped
          body is noted, also its probable economic importance to the
          State. Attention is now directed to the potential usefulness
          of this great body, offering many new Mechanical, Mining, and
          Chemical Engineering studies for engineering students of the
          University, also as a source of revenue for the Utah Research
          Foundation which has just been created.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A "heat and products" study
          has been made in the destructive distillation of this cannel
          coal. Superheated steam was used as the heat-transferring
          fluid, wherein the heat units involved have been measured and
          their distribution traced during the mechanism of the heat
          transfer while heating. Also while abstracting heat,
          "dry-quenching" the residue, with low temperature steam. The
          quantity of coal gas and the semi-coke were determined, also
          the crude oil product was refined into desirable petroleum
          derivatives.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Steam from turbine exhaust
          or other economical source, when reheated, provides an
          effectual way of transferring the necessary heat into batches
          of dust-free slack coal and accomplishing very rapid
          distillation. Important economies in steam consumption are
          obtained, (1) by preheating the coal, (2) by using maximum
          steam temperature, (3) by using physically dry coal, (4) by
          reducing heat absorption in walls of retort by using retort
          covering of low conductivity and heat capacity, therefore by
          using large diameter charge of coal to minimize surface loss
          factor, (5) by reducing radiation losses, (6) by utilizing the
          heat stored in top portion of coal charge to distill by
          transfer of its heat to the lower portion of coal charge, (7)
          by using sensible heat of coal residue to preheat new coal,
          (8) by condensing the issuing steam and oil vapors in an
          evaporator and using the new steam generated to dry-quench and
          preheat other new coal charges, (9) by using very tall retorts
          full of properly sized coal. The data indicate that the small
          diameter retort used in these studies can apply economies and
          distill coal with less than one pound of steam per pound of
          coal treated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This cannel coal, unlike the
          fusing types of bituminous coking coals, has the desirable
          physical property of holding its form without crushing or
          cohesion while passing through the treatment. The solid
          residue is active chemically, though high in ash, and should
          be a good smokeless domestic fuel or fuel for industrial gas.
          The crude oil was readily cracked into a color-stable,
          non-gumforming gasoline with small refining loss.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The slack coal should
          provide a permanent supply of low-priced city gas and diesel
          powerplant oil, also motor fuel and road oil, and develop a
          new coal mining industry of a remarkable coal with steady
          employment for labor in southern Utah.</font> </p>
