      <p><b>3.&nbsp;<a name="3"></a>History Low Temperature
          Carbonization</b> </p>
      <p>Low Temperature Carbonization (LTC) of coal is not new. A great
        deal of scientific and technological work has been done on this
        form of coal processing in Germany, England, and USA. It is
        closely allied with the principles embodied in the industries
        which produce oil shale in Scotland and Australia. The subject
        began to receive governmental aid about 1906 and since then a
        great number and variety of processes have been developed, and
        patents issued. The most promising processes of treating coal
        have been developed to meet the needs of certain localities,
        viz., types of coals and economic factors. </p>
      <p>The principle products of LTC are smokeless fuel, tar-oils and
        gas. From Utah coals particularly there may be produced tar
        acids, resins, and ammonia products. The quantities and
        characteristics of each of these products obtained from
        carbonization varies more with the type of coal used than with
        the method of heating. However, the temperature and time of
        heating greatly influence the yield and character of all the
        products. Hence the problem lies in developing a method of
        heating the coal which will best suit the particular needs. </p>
      <p>There are two general methods of supplying heat, viz., external
        and internal heating. In the external heating method the coal to
        be treated is placed in an airtight cylinder of small diameter
        and heat applied to the outside. The volatile matters that are
        expelled are generally let off at one end if the cylinder is
        horizontal or at the top if vertical; although one important
        process was a perforated vapor takeoff centrally placed in which
        the vapors pass, and from which they are conducted out of either
        end of the retort. </p>
      <p>In the internal method of heating coal, some inert gas that
        will not react with the coal when heated, and preferably will
        not dilute the gases, is passed through the charge to transmit
        heat to it. In a number of process, producer gas is used as the
        internal heating agent but this obviously gives a resulting gas
        of low fuel value. </p>
      <p>Several of the processes that are developed by Mr Karrick from
        his studies of treating Utah coals differs from former processes
        in the type of heating medium used and the method of its
        application and the type of equipment. In one of the Karrick
        Processes superheated steam is used to transmit the heat to the
        sized, dust-free coal. Vertical metal cylinders insulated on the
        outside are used for retorts. The treating of Utah coal is
        easily accomplished by this method because (1) its highly
        volatile content of oils and gases are rapidly carried away with
        the steam into zones of low temperature; (2) Utah coal does not
        fuse nor disintegrate ion heating and hence allows the steam to
        distribute itself evenly throughout the charge during the entire
        process; (3) the rate and temperature of the heat applied
        controls the density of the treated coal product; (4) the oils
        and gas given off can be separated easily from the steam by use
        of fractionating condensers. </p>
      <p>Mr Karrick worked on two general methods of treating Utah coals
        by this type of processing, viz., continuous and batch method.
        Figure 1 [Not included] is a sketch of the setup used in the
        continuous method at Pittsburg. The drawings in the back show
        the setup used in the batch method. </p>
      <p><b>4.&nbsp;<a name="4"></a>Process for Continuous Method</b> </p>
      <p>Magazine "e" delivers the sized and dust-free coal to be
        carbonized to the retort. The upper part of the vertical metal
        carbonizing chamber "g" is 10 feet high and 5 inches inside
        diameter increasing to 7 inches at "h" where superheated steam
        from the generator "a" is introduced through a manifold. Lower
        section "i" of the carbonizing chamber is 3.5 ft long and is
        externally heated electrically; "j" is the feeding mechanism
        used to discharge the devolatilized coal. "K" is a condenser for
        the heaviest oils, "l" is an air-cooled condenser which removes
        the tar and the steam; "n" is a scrubber and "o" is a gas meter.
      </p>
      <p>The carbonizing chamber and supply bin was filled with sized
        coal and superheated steam was run upwardly through the charge
        until the temperature of the coal had reached the value for
        normal operation. The feeding mechanism was then started and all
        the charge passed through the retort. A quantity of coal was
        placed in the bin sufficient to occupy 3 hours of continuous
        carbonization was usually used. </p>
      <p>In a commercial plant the retorts would be about 3 feet in
        diameter and 20 feet high. The superheated steam would enter at
        a temperature of 1200° degrees F under a pressure sufficiently
        high to overcome the friction of passage through the charge.
        Approximately one-half to one pound of superheated steam would
        be used for each pound of coal treated. Before discharging the
        product into cars or onto a conveyer belt below the retort
        saturated steam would be passed into the bottom of the lower bin
        and up through the charge in "p" so as to re-use this heat and
        reduce the temperature of the devolatilized smokeless coal. </p>
      <p><b>5.&nbsp;<a name="5"></a>Process for the Batch Method</b> </p>
      <p>In this method the retorts are metal cylinders 3 feet in
        diameter and 20 feet high with a capacity of 2-1/2 tons each,
        insulated on the outside with diatomaceous earth. The steam
        enters the charge through a manifold at the top of the retort
        and is led off at the bottom. In the batch method the coal is
        dried and preheated to 300°-600° F in the bunkers with flue
        gases. Superheated steam at a temperature 1000°-1400° F and
        under a pressure of several lb/sq inch blows through the charge
        from 2-3 hours depending upon the preheat of the coal and the
        size of the lumps. During this period the upper 2/3 of the
        charge is carbonized. Then the superheated steam is shut off and
        switched over into another retort and saturated steam is blown
        in for a period of 2-3 hours. Also oil may be vaporized or
        sprayed into the top of the retort at the end of the carbonizing
        period. The heat contained in the upper 2/3 of the charge is
        sufficient to superheat the entering saturated steam so that the
        lower third of the charge is carbonized by this reclaimed heat,
        while the oil vapors may also be cracked into gasoline. Either
        water or very wet steam is then passed into the charge to cool
        it down to 400 F or below before discharging. </p>
      <p>In the batch process the coal is charged into the retorts in
        several graded sizes varying in the case of Utah slack coal from
        1-5/8" to 3/8" diameter. The coarsest material is placed on the
        bottom with the finest on top. Large sizes of crushed power
        plant coal may also be treated by this method or by the
        continuous process. </p>
      <p>The product at the end of the carbonization period is emptied
        into cars or onto a conveyer and is taken to the storage bins
        where it may be further screened into its different marketable
        sizes ready for shipment. The gas and oils are carried out with
        the steam and are separated in the condenser and separator
        units. </p>
      <p>This type of crude oil produces a large quantity of carbon when
        it is cracked so that by passing the crude through the hot coke,
        causes a large part of the carbon to be released to be
        precipitated on the treated coal. The crude oils therefore are
        topped and the heavier portion is then passed down over the hot
        coke and the light vapors produced are condensed and run into
        storage tanks. The gas is separated and stored in a gas
        holder&nbsp; ready for purification and distribution. </p>
      <p>In a commercial the steam will be generated from the coal which
        is under 3/8" in diameter comprising part of the shipments of
        coal delivered to plant for treatment. The superheater will be
        fired either with the gas that comes from the process or with
        the fine coal, either stoker fired or with pulverized coal
        burners. </p>
      <p>A small demonstration unit of the batch type is being used at
        the University of Utah for the purpose of producing test samples
        of smokeless fuels from the principal coal mines of the state.
        Representative samples of coal form Wyoming and Idaho also have
        been treated, the smokeless fuel product from each having been
        used in domestic heating appliances and were found to have the
        desirable kindling and burning properties. </p>
      <p>His plant comprises a vertical steel cylinder into which sized,
        dust-free coal is charged, the coal being introduced so that the
        small lumps form the upper layers and the large lumps the base
        of the charge. The heating is accomplished by an atmosphere of
        superheated steam which flows down through the coal and in
        contact with the lumps. </p>
      <p>Steam is supplied from the power plant and is superheated for
        use in the coal-treating unit by passing it through a spiral
        coil of 50 feet of 1/2" stainless steel pipe. The coil is set
        vertically in the annular space between a central core and an
        outer insulating wall. The steam flows downwardly through the
        coil while the heating gases pass upwardly around the coil
        counter-flow to the steam. The heating gases are derived from
        burning gas in a combustion chamber in communication with the
        superheater chamber. The flow of the steam is controlled by a
        regulating valve and pressure gauge at the inlet of the
        superheater while the burning of varying amounts of gas makes
        possible the heating of the steam to temperatures as high as
        1600° F if desired. </p>
      <p>In about 40 test runs recently made, the rate of oxidation of
        the hottest portion of the superheater tubing indicated that
        replacement of the hot end of the coil would not be required for
        possibly 200-250 hours. A new section of the coil recently
        installed was coated with an aluminum preparation which is
        claimed to resist oxidation at 1100° F. In larger units now
        being contemplated the hottest elements will be of calorized
        (aluminum impregnated) steel tubing which resists oxidation
        exceptionally well at 1600° F over long periods. </p>
      <p>The steam passes out of the bottom of the retorting chamber
        mixed with the lubricated gases and oil vapors from the coal. It
        then passes into a "hot" condenser which permits the condesation
        only of the oils and resins that are heavier than water, and
        also prevents condensation of any of the steam. This condenser
        consists of two 7-feet lengths of 2" pipe set vertically and
        connected together at the bottom and having an oil drain at the
        lowest point. Inside the 2" pipes are twisted metal ribbons
        which fill the pipes giving a whirling motion to the stream of
        vapors and gases, thus causing efficient contacting of the
        fluids with the condenser walls. Outside of these pipes are 3"
        steam jackets 6-1/2 ft long with inlet and outlet control valves
        and a pressure gauge. By adjusting the steam pressure in the
        jacket the temperature of the condenser surface is readily
        controlled to condense out any portion desired of the heavy
        (high-boiling) oil. The steam enters the top of one branch of
        this condenser, then passes down and up the other branch and out
        at its top. </p>
      <p>Following the "hot" condenser is a "cold" condenser consisting
        of a vertical water tank 10" diameter and 20' long in which is a
        double copper coil taken from a gas water-heater. The vapors
        pass down through this coil which is surrounded by a flow of
        cold water.&nbsp; The condensed oil and water flow out of the
        condenser at its lowest point and thereby effects condensation
        by concurrent flow of the condensing vapors and condensed
        products which effects more efficient condensation of the
        lightest volatiles. The cooling water is coldest at the outlet
        portion of the condenser. </p>
      <p>The condensed products pass form the "cold" condenser into an
        oil-water separator. This device is designed to permit long
        aquescent flow of the oil and water so as to enable then to
        separate well by difference in specific gravity. The device is a
        cylindrical tank set vertically, 12" diameter, and 6' high, and
        contains a spiral vertical wall starting at the center and
        passing 6 times around, thereby forming a continuous channel 1"
        wide by 6" deep and about 10 ft long. The oil and water enter by
        a drop-pipe at the center of the lid and pass through the spiral
        channel and are decanted through two goose-neck outlet pipes at
        the top and bottom of the outer wall of the tank, the water
        flowing out at the lower opening and the oil at the top opening.
        Receivers are provided for these products, also for the "hot"
        oil condensate. </p>
      <p>The incondensable oil is burned at the top of a gas off-tube,
        or chimney, in the lid of the separator. </p>
      <p>In normal operation of this LTC unit, a charge of about 15 lb
        of coal, sized to minus 1/5" plus 3/8", is placed in the retort
        with the fine coal on top and the coarse coal at the bottom. The
        lid is fastened down with a gasket and bolts making it
        gas-tight. The gas fire is started and within 10 minutes the
        steam attains a temperature of 1100° F, which temperature
        usually is used, this being below the temperature (1200° F) at
        which water gas begins to form from the reaction of the steam
        and the active low-temperature coke, also the temperature at
        which vapor-phase cracking of the oil vapors begins to occur.
        Higher temperatures are used when either of the above reactions
        are desired. </p>
      <p>With 15 lb of coal in the retort, and a flow of approximately ½
        lb of steam per minute at 1000° F to 1150° F, the charge of coal
        is distilled to a smokeless condition in 60-90 minutes. The
        treated coal, now rendered smokeless, is then dry-quenched by
        passing saturated steam through the charge. </p>
      <p>If the coal is preheated, the distillation time and the
        quantity of steam is reduced. Also, the heat lost from the
        retort walls, trough insufficient insulation, is excessive and
        can be cut down greatly. With cooling water entering the "cold"
        condenser at 700° F and leaving at 120° F, there is required 14
        lb of cooling water per minute or 1.7 gallons. Usually the
        superheated steam flow is continued until the distillation zone
        has passed 2/3 the way down the retort and then saturated steam
        is substituted. The latter steam becomes superheated in the top
        part of the treated coal and thence carries on the distilling to
        the bottom of the retort. This technic has the advantage of
        dry-quenching the treated coal while simultaneously completing
        the distillation. </p>
      <p><b>6.&nbsp;<a name="6"></a>Products Obtained From LTC Karrick
          Process</b> </p>
      <p>The desiderata of LTC are: </p>
      <p>(1) The production of a popular smokeless fuel suitable for
        domestic and other purposes and at attractive prices. </p>
      <p>(2) The maximum production of oil of low specific gravity which
        can be easily refined into suitable products for local markets.
      </p>
      <p>(3) The maximum production of gas of high calorific value. </p>
      <p><b><i>Smokeless Fuel</i></b>: The smoke from fuel is due to
        soot which is unburned carbon and heavy tars that come mainly
        from incomplete burning of the oils and tars formed in the
        heating of the coal. When the volatile matter in Utah coal is
        reduced so that the coke contains 1% or less by weight, the
        resulting product is a smokeless fuel. The combustible nature of
        the carbon in the coal is not affected by LTC where the carbon
        is changed to a graphitic form which is difficult to ignite and
        burn in household types of heating equipment. </p>
      <p>The ignition point of low temperature coke is practically the
        same as the coal from which it was made. The product resembles
        anthracite coal very much in its burning properties, although it
        ignites somewhat more readily and is freer burning. It burns
        with a shnort blue flame with no smoke and gives off a great
        deal of heat in the form of radiation. It has a much higher
        efficiency in burning than ordinary coal. The product looks very
        much like the coal from which it was made, but only weighs
        60-75% as much. </p>
      <p><b><i>Oils</i></b>: When LTC of Utah coal is carried on until
        the product has less than 18% volatile matter remaining the
        yield of crude oils obtained will be approximately 30 gal per
        ton of coal treated. When this oil is cracked it yields 10 gal
        gasoline, 800 cu ft of 1300 Btu gas and 90-100 lb oil coke. The
        gasoline obtained resembles the present form of the best ethyl
        or other high anti-knock gasoline; "The chemical properties of
        oils arising out of the high olefinic content fit them for use
        in high compression motors" -- (<i>Composition of Light Oils of
          LTC</i>, by R.L. Brown and R.V. Cooper in <i>Industrial &amp;
          Engineering Chemistry</i>). The oil coke is a very high
        quality product which can be mixed with low-temperature coke and
        sold for domestic fuel. </p>
      <p><b><i>Gas</i></b>: The analysis of the gases obtained in the
        LTC studies of Utah’s coals by Mr Karrick in the large-scale
        experiments conducted at the Pittsburgh experimental Station and
        were reported by F.E. Frey and W.P. Yent are given in Table 1.
        From the inspection of the last two items in each column it can
        be seen that as the temperature of the steam is raised the
        volume of gas produced is increased with a corresponding
        decrease in the Btu value. The calculated Btu given for
        temperature of 1115° F seems to be in error. If this is the
        case, then with a temperature of 1115° F a gas with a Btu value
        of 1000 Btu per cu ft could be obtained. Also, at 1200° F the
        fuel value should be about 9800 Btu/cu ft. </p>
      <p>If the product is not heated to a temperature above 1200° F the
        gas formed is a truly low-temperature gas, but if 1200° F is
        exceeded steam and coal react with each other and form water
        gas. This gas has theoretically a Btu value of from 217-324 Btu
        per cu ft depending on the amounts of H2, CO and CO2 formed,
        hence it is a diluent and may be undesirable. Also when this gas
        is produced the quantity of low-temperature coke obtainable is
        diminished. This gas is very good for household use having a
        calorific value comparable with natural gas and burns with an
        inoffensive odor. </p>

      </p>
      <p><b><i>Heat Exchange</i></b>: There are several methods of
        regulating the transfer of heat, to the coal for carbonization,
        and away from it after the process sis completed. Among some of
        the methods that have been investigated are the following: </p>
      <p>First: <br>
        <i>Assumptions</i> -- <br>
        (1) Coal dried and preheated to 300° F in bunkers <br>
        (2) Superheated steam (1400° F) <br>
        (3) Period of superheating: 2 hours <br>
        (4) Coal carbonized 2/3 of way down at end of 2 hours <br>
        (5) Steam leaves at average temperature of 800° F <br>
        (6) Each retort holds 5000 lb coal <br>
        (7) Coal cooled with saturated steam. </p>
      <p>Heat lost per lb of superheated steam = ( 1400 - 800 ) / 0.5 =
        300 Btu. <br>
        Heat taken up by coal that is carbonized in upper 2/3 of retort
        = <br>
        2/3 x 500 x 2/3 (*a) x 0.20 (*b) [ 1200 - 933 (*c) / 2 ] - 300 ]
        = 340,000 Btu. <br>
        Heat taken up by coal in lower 1/3 of retort = <br>
        5000 x 1/3 x 0.31 (d) [ 866 (*e) – 300 ] = 292,000 Btu <br>
        Total heat taken up by coal = 632,000 Btu. <br>
        (*a) Spec. weight of the coke = 2/3 sp wt of coal; (*b) sp heat
        of coke = 0.20; (*c) temperature at 2/3 point is 933 F; (*d) sp
        heat of coal = 0.31; (*e) average temperature in lower 1/3 of
        retort. </p>
      <p>Number of lb superheated steam required = 632,000 / 300 = 2106
        lb. <br>
        Heat given off by coke in upper 2/3 when cooled to 400° F = <br>

        Total heat given off = 567,000 Btu </p>
      <p>Heat taken up per lb of saturated steam when heated from 225° F
        to 400° F = <br>

      <p>Number taken up per lb of saturated steam required = <br>
        567,000 / 87.5 = 6430 lb </p>
      <p>Total weight of water required in the form of steam = 8536 lb </p>
      <p>Heat given up per lb by the steam when cooled and condensed
        from 800° F to 190° F = <br>
        [ ( 800 - 220 ) x 0.5 / ( 1100 - 190 ) ] = 1100 Btu/lb. </p>
      <p>Heat given up by a superheated steam = 1100 x 2106 = 2,320,000
        Btu </p>
      <p>Heat given up by saturated steam if cooled and condensed from
        400° F to 190° F = </p>
      <p>[ ( 400 - 220 ) x 0.5 / ( 1100 - 190 ) ] x 6430 = 5,787,000 </p>

      <p>Rate = 71,036 / 2 x 62.5 x 3600 = 0.158 cu ft/sec. </p>
      <p>Second: <br>
        <i>Assumptions</i> -- <br>
        (1) Coal dried and preheated to 300° F in bunkers. <br>
        (2) Superheated steam at 1400° F is passed into charge for 2
        hours. <br>
        (3) Heat is transferred from one retort to another by passing
        the gases out of the bottom of the hot charge up through the
        bottom of the cold charge. </p>
      <p>Temperature gradient in charge before the superheated steam is
        turned will vary from 500° F at bottom to 400° F at top. </p>
      <p>Heat given up by superheated steam when cooled from 1400° F to

      <p>The remaining heat above 400° F will have to be removed by
        water or saturated steam. </p>
      <p>Heat given up by steam when cooled and condensed from 800° F to
        190° F = <br>
        ( 800 - 220 ) x 0.5 / 970 / 30 = 1290 Btu per lb steam. </p>
      <p>Heat taken up per lb of condensing water used when it is heated
        from 70° F to 190° F = 120 Btu. </p>
      <p>/\ Number of lb of condensing water required = 1290 x 2750 /
        120 = 29,800 lb. </p>
      <p>Third: <br>
        <i>Assumptions --</i> <br>
        (1) Coal dried and preheated in bunkers with flue gases to 300°
        F. <br>
        (2) Heat supplied by superheated steam running for 2 hours at
        same rate as the superheated steam and finished cooling with
        water. <br>
        (3) Charge cooled with saturated steam running for two hours at
        same rate as the superheated steam and finished cooling with
        water. <br>
        (4) Temperature at 2/3 point when superheat is shut off is 900°
        F. The amount of heat required to carbonize upper 2/3 = <br>
        ( 1050 - 300 ) x 0.2 = 150 Btu/lb of coke </p>
      <p>Amount of heat taken up in upper 2/3 = <br>
        5000 x 2/3 x 2/3 x 150 = 333,330 Btu </p>
      <p>Amount of heat taken up in lower 1/3 = <br>
        5000 x 1/3 x 0.3 ( 650 - 300 ) = 275,000 Btu </p>
      <p>/\ Total heat supplied = 608,333 Btu. </p>
      <p>Heat taken out of superheated steam when it is cooled from
        1400° F to 800° F = <br>
        ( 1400 - 800 ) x 0.5 = 300 Btu/lb </p>
      <p>Number of lb superheated steam required to carbonize the coal =
        <br>
        608,333 / 300 = 2026. 67 lb. </p>
      <p>Heat given up by coal in lower 1/3 of retort when cooled to
        400° F = <br>
        5000 x 1/3 x 0.31 ( 850 - 400 ) = 225,000 Btu </p>
      <p>/\ Total heat given up by coal = 514,000 Btu </p>
      <p>Heat taken up by saturated steam when it is heated from 225° F
        to 400° F = <br>
        175 x 0.5 = 87.5 Btu </p>
      <p>If 2026.67 lb saturated steam are introduced, heat taken up = <br>
        2026.67 x 87.5 = 177,000 Btu. </p>
      <p>Amount of heat left in charge to be removed = <br>
        514,000 - 177,000 = 337,000 Btu. </p>
      <p>Latent heat of water = 1000 Btu/lb. </p>
      <p>/\ Amount of water needed to finish the quenching = <br>
        337,000 / 1000 = 337 lb. </p>
      <p>Total water needed in form of steam and water = 4390.34 lb. </p>
      <p>Heat given up per lb of steam when cooled and condensed from
        800° F to 190° F = 1290 Btu per lb of steam. </p>
      <p>/\ Number of lb of condensing water required = <br>
        1290 / 120 x 2026.67 x 2 = 43,500 lb. </p>
      <p>In the first method of heat transfer, no additional apparatus
        is needed to extract the heat from the charge before taking it
        from the retorts. However, a great deal of water will be
        necessary for the procedure. </p>
      <p>The second method makes the most economical use of heat
        possible. It requires the least amount of steam and water but
        does require the installation of additional apparatus in the
        form of pumps and insulated piping. </p>
      <p>The third method is similar to the first except that water is
        used for part of the quenching. The main objection to this
        method over the first method is the additional piping required
        and also the inexact method of determining the quantity of water
        needed to just quench the product and not leave it wet. In a
        small plant such as the one designed for a test plant, the first
        or third methods of heat transfer would be used. But in a large
        installation the second method would be justified and most
        economical. </p>
      <p><b>8.&nbsp;<a name="8"></a>Design of Unit Plant</b> </p>
      <p>Since Mr Karrick’s return from Pittsburgh, where he carried on
        extensive research work on Utah coals for the production of a
        smokeless fuel, he has been advocating the building of a
        commercial plant. In a discussion of the possibilities of
        producing smokeless fuel, at one of the Smoke Abatement
        Committee’s meetings, it was decided that without plans,
        specifications, and estimates of construction and operating
        costs being drawn up, no accurate knowledge of the economics of
        Mr Karrick’s project could be obtained. The Committee finally
        agreed to instruct the Research Department of the University of
        Utah to prepare plans for the smallest sized unit of a treating
        plant that could use commercial sized retorts and other
        equipment. $50,000 was suggested as the appropriate cost of such
        a plant. </p>
      <p>Under the direction of Mr Karrick, Mr Wardrop and Dean Ketchum,
        a unit plant has been designed to be presented to the Smoke
        Abatement Committee. </p>
      <p><i>Location of Plant</i><b>: </b>From economic considerations
        as well as convenience and desirability, a location for the test
        plant has been selected at Spring Glen, Utah…. [ etails not
        included here ]. </p>
      <p><i>Building Requirements</i>: In building a unit plant for
        demonstration purposes it is very desirable to construct it as a
        large commercial plant would be constructed only smaller in
        size. Or, in other words, the handling of the coal, the oil, the
        smokeless fuel, and the gas will be handled in the same manner
        as in a commercial plant. The coal will come in car loads lots,
        unloaded, stored and charged into the retorts with mechanical
        equipment. The products will be led off, separated, and refined
        ready for market. Everything will be run in a systematic orderly
        manner so that information regarding any part of the process can
        be obtained and experimental work done to improve the processing
        or the products produced. </p>
      <p>This grouping of the entire process together is very important
        on a test plant of this sort because: </p>
      <p>(1) It is very difficult to get cost data where the processing
        is scattered out. </p>
      <p>(2) It is very difficult to keep account of all products
        produced, such as the gas, tar acid, resins, etc., that are
        produced when the crude oil is cracked and refined. </p>
      <p>(3) The cost of shipping crude oil great distances prohibits
        its refining. </p>
      <p>(4) It makes possible the study of the byproducts and methods
        of processing. </p>
      <p>The plant is designed for minimum operation cost, hence all
        materials will be handled mechanically to do away with hand
        operations as much as possible. In deciding on the capacity of
        the plant, an arbitrary figure was chosen at about one carload
        per day. This gives 30 tons to be treated and 10 tons to be used
        as fuel under the boilers every 24 hours. </p>
      <p>In buying the coal to be treated, it will be specified that the
        slack shall not have over 25% that will pass through a 3/8”
        screen. It will be necessary to make these specifications
        because in ordinary 1-5/8” slack over 68% will pass through a
        3/8” screen, as shown on the screen data curves. This, however,
        will not place any rigid requirements on the mining interests,
        but will keep the mine sweepings out of the coal purchased. </p>
      <p>The accompanying flow sheet shows what products go into the
        process and what products come out. Drawings of the plant
        arrangement and of the apparatus used are included in the back.
        [Not available] </p>
      <p>The track hopper is of the standard Jeffery type, with a
        capacity of 80 tons or two carloads. This capacity will, with
        the bunkers full, provide for a 3-day run without replenishment.
        A standard Jeffery elevator is used to raise the coal from the
        hopper to the screens, 65 feet above the tracks. It has a
        capacity of 5 tons per hour so that the bunkers can be filled in
        8 hours or during one shift. </p>
      <p>The screens are of the shaker type and with the same capacity
        as the elevator. They divide the coal into 4 sizes: one below
        3/8” diameter and three over 3/8”. </p>
      <p>The four bunkers each have a capacity of 10 tons so that a car
        of coal can be screened into them at one time. The three bunkers
        that feed the retorts are equipped with hot gas heaters that
        allow the hot flue gases from the superheater to blow up through
        the coal to dry and partly heat it before it is charged into the
        retorts. The bunkers are made of steel plates with sloping
        bottoms that direct the coal to the spouts. </p>
      <p>A steel monorail larry car of about one ton capacity is used to
        load the retorts. It is operated by hand from the loading
        platform. There are three steel retorts with accommodations
        provided for one more. They are 3 feet in diameter and 15 feet 9
        inches high with a capacity of 2-1/2 tons each. The retorts are
        made of ½”steel plate and insulated on the outside with 12” of
        diatomaceous earth, that is held in position by another metal
        cylinder. In order to take care of the thermal expansion, the
        retorts are hung from the top and rest on a ball bearing with
        side supports and a spring arrangement, as shown in the detailed
        sketch, to keep them straight. The coves for the top and bottom
        openings are designed to allow for no leakage of steam during
        expansion by having a knife edge around the lid press against a
        ring of asbestos packing. The bottom of the retort had to be
        contracted so that the bottom door would not be too heavy. A
        door the same size as the cross-section of the retort would
        weigh 1000 lb, and hence would be too heavy to manage by hand. A
        chain with crossbars on is hung down through the center of the
        charge. When the charge is ready to be taken out, the chain is
        jerked up, with a hoist, which loosens the charge so that it
        will fall out. </p>
      <p>The steam is led in at the top through a specially designed
        connection and valve to take care of the thermal expansion, as
        shown in detailed drawing. The steam and gas are led through a
        hot condenser where the heavy oils are taken out. The gases then
        go to the cold condenser where the steam and oils are condensed
        and the gas led off. The condensed liquid then goes to the
        separator where the crude oil and waste water are separated. The
        gas is first scrubbed and then stored in a gas holder. The crude
        oil is taken to the crude storage tanks before being cracked and
        refined </p>
      <p>The hot condenser reduces the temperature of the steam and
        gases from 800° F to 240° F and is designed to handle 2000 lb of
        steam per hour. In this condenser about 630,000 Btu are removed
        per hour. The cold condenser is designed to reduce the
        temperature of the gases to 120° F. Its capacity is for 2000 lb
        per hour. The condensing water used enters at 70° F and leaves
        at 120° F. About 18 gal per minute of condensing water will be
        required. </p>
      <p>The smokeless fuel is dropped into cars beneath the retorts and
        then hoisted to the storage bins where it is screened into 3
        marketable sizes before going into covered bins ready for
        shipment. Each of the 3 bins will have a capacity of about 30
        tons. </p>
      <p>The superheated steam supplied to the retorts comes from a
        gas-heated superheater. The superheater is 6’8" x 5’11" x 15’ 6"
        and is made of refractory brick. The pipes have a heating
        surface of 880 sq. ft and a capacity of 1500 cu ft per hour and
        a steam velocity of 240 ft/sec. In the lower 3-1/2 feet 1-1/2"
        calorized pipe which is good for 1600° F without corroding is
        used. In the upper 8-1/2 feet standard 1-1/2" steam pipe is
        used. Arrangement of the tubing, as shown in the detailed
        drawings, is made so tha the pipes can be repaired when they
        become corroded, by having valve arrangements at the bottom to
        shut off any section independent of the rest of the superheater.
        The pipes have RR unions on the bends with loose bricks opposite
        them in the walls so that the pipes can be removed. </p>
      <p>A 50 kw turbine generator set will be used to supply light and
        power to the plant. </p>
      <p>In the test plant a large quantity of gas (3000 cu ft/ton) is
        produced during the treatment. </p>
      <p>As a supplementary source of revenue we have planned to
        distribute this gas [locally -- section not included here] </p>
      <p>It would be wise to consider a distributing system for gas when
        a plant is built. </p>

      <p>Utah has a natural resource, coal, which in its dormant state
        means little but if developed will give to Utah a gigantic
        industry. </p>
      <p>Although Utah has a huge supply of coal, its present method of
        use is undesirable. The burning of coal by hand-fired burners
        has created the smoke menace. To surmount this problem, a plan
        has been presented, namely the Karrick process of
        low-temperature carbonization. In this process, valuable oil,
        gasoline, and gas are obtained from the coal, leaving a
        desirable low-priced smokeless fuel. </p>
      <p>From the figures given, it is seen that the process is
        justifiable, economical, and scientifical. A commercial test
        plant can be built which will, without a doubt, pay dividends. </p>
      <p>As a sideline a distributing system of the gas obtained from
        the treating of the coal can be constructed to a benefit. </p>
      <p>It is our sincere recommendation that such a plant as herein
