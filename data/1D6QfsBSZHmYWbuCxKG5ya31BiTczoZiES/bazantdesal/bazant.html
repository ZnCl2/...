      <i>Diagram of the new process shows how a shockwave (red line) is
        generated in salty water flowing through a porous medium, with a
        voltage applied to membranes (green) at each side of the vessel.
        The shockwave pushed the salt ions off to one side of the flow,
        leaving fresh water at the other side, where it can be separated
        out.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Researchers say the new desalination method could be useful
        for cleaning the contaminated water generated by hydraulic
        fracturing, or fracking. Shown here is a holding pit for
        fracking water.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      As the availability of clean, potable water becomes an
      increasingly urgent issue in many parts of the world, researchers
      are searching for new ways to treat salty, brackish or
      contaminated water to make it usable. Now a team at MIT has come
      up with an innovative approach that, unlike most traditional
      desalination systems, does not separate ions or water molecules
      with filters, which can become clogged, or boiling, which consumes
      great amounts of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, the system uses an electrically driven shockwave within a
      stream of flowing water, which pushes salty water to one side of
      the flow and fresh water to the other, allowing easy separation of
      the two streams. The new approach is described in the journal
      Environmental Science and Technology Letters, in a paper by
      professor of chemical engineering and mathematics Martin Bazant,
      graduate student Sven Schlumpberger, undergraduate Nancy Lu, and
      former postdoc Matthew Suss.<br>
      <br>
      This approach is “a fundamentally new and different separation
      system,” Bazant says. And unlike most other approaches to
      desalination or water purification, he adds, this one performs a
      “membraneless separation” of ions and particles.<br>
      <br>
      Membranes in traditional desalination systems, such as those that
      use reverse osmosis or electrodialysis, are “selective barriers,”
      Bazant explains: They allow molecules of water to pass through,
      but block the larger sodium and chlorine atoms of salt. Compared
      to conventional electrodialysis, “This process looks similar, but
      it’s fundamentally different,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      In the new process, called shock electrodialysis, water flows
      through a porous material —in this case, made of tiny glass
      particles, called a frit — with membranes or electrodes
      sandwiching the porous material on each side. When an electric
      current flows through the system, the salty water divides into
      regions where the salt concentration is either depleted or
      enriched. When that current is increased to a certain point, it
      generates a shockwave between these two zones, sharply dividing
      the streams and allowing the fresh and salty regions to be
      separated by a simple physical barrier at the center of the flow.<br>
      <br>
      “It generates a very strong gradient,” Bazant says.<br>
      <br>
      Even though the system can use membranes on each side of the
      porous material, Bazant explains, the water flows across those
      membranes, not through them. That means they are not as vulnerable
      to fouling — a buildup of filtered material — or to degradation
      due to water pressure, as happens with conventional membrane-based
      desalination, including conventional electrodialysis. “The salt
      doesn’t have to push through something,” Bazant says. The charged
      salt particles, or ions, “just move to one side,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      The underlying phenomenon of generating a shockwave of salt
      concentration was discovered a few years ago by the group of Juan
      Santiago at Stanford University. But that finding, which involved
      experiments with a tiny microfluidic device and no flowing water,
      was not used to remove salt from the water, says Bazant, who is
      currently on sabbatical at Stanford.<br>
      <br>
      The new system, by contrast, is a continuous process, using water
      flowing through cheap porous media, that should be relatively easy
      to scale up for desalination or water purification. “The
      breakthrough here is the engineering [of a practical system],”
      Bazant says.<br>
      <br>
      One possible application would be in cleaning the vast amounts of
      wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This
      contaminated water tends to be salty, sometimes with trace amounts
      of toxic ions, so finding a practical and inexpensive way of
      cleaning it would be highly desirable. This system not only
      removes salt, but also a wide variety of other contaminants — and
      because of the electrical current passing through, it may also
      sterilize the stream. “The electric fields are pretty high, so we
      may be able to kill the bacteria,” Schlumpberger says.<br>
      <br>
      The research produced both a laboratory demonstration of the
      process in action and a theoretical analysis that explains why the
      process works, Bazant says. The next step is to design a scaled-up
      system that could go through practical testing.<br>
      <br>
      Initially at least, this process would not be competitive with
      methods such as reverse osmosis for large-scale seawater
      desalination. But it could find other uses in the cleanup of
      contaminated water, Schlumpberger says.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike some other approaches to desalination, he adds, this one
      requires little infrastructure, so it might be useful for portable
      systems for use in remote locations, or for emergencies where
      water supplies are disrupted by storms or earthquakes.<br>
      <br>
      Maarten Biesheuvel, a principal scientist at the Netherlands Water
      Technology Institute who was not involved in this research, says
      the work “is of very high significance to the field of water
      desalination. It opens up a whole range of new possibilities for
      water desalination, both for seawater and brackish water
      resources, such as groundwater.”<br>
      <br>
      Biesheuvel adds that this team “shows a radically new design where
      within one and the same channel ions are separated between
      different regions. … I expect that this discovery will become a
      big ‘hit’ in the academic field. … It will be interesting to see
      whether the upscaling of this technology, from a single cell to a
      stack of thousands of cells, can be achieved without undue
      problems.”<br>

      Weatherford International, the USA-Israel Binational Science
      Foundation, and the SUTD-MIT Graduate Fellows Program.<br>

      Most electrochemical processes, such as electrodialysis, are
      limited by diffusion, but in porous media, surface conduction and
      electroosmotic flow also contribute to ionic flux. In this
      article, we report experimental evidence for surface-driven
      overlimiting current (faster than diffusion) and deionization
      shocks (propagating salt removal) in a porous medium. The
      apparatus consists of a silica glass frit (1 mm thick with a 500
      nm mean pore size) in an aqueous electrolyte (CuSO4 or AgNO3)
      passing ionic current from a reservoir to a cation-selective
      membrane (Nafion). The current–voltage relation of the whole
      system is consistent with a proposed theory based on the
      electroosmotic flow mechanism over a broad range of reservoir salt
      concentrations (0.1 mM to 1.0 M) after accounting for (Cu)
      electrode polarization and pH-regulated silica charge. Above the
      limiting current, deionized water (≈10 μM) can be continuously
      extracted from the frit, which implies the existence of a stable
      shock propagating against the flow, bordering a depleted region
      that extends more than 0.5 mm across the outlet. The results
      suggest the feasibility of shock electrodialysis as a new approach
      to water desalination and other electrochemical separations.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Rising global demand for potable water is driving innovation in
      water treatment methods. Shock electrodialysis is a recently
      proposed technique that exploits deionization shock waves in
      porous media to purify water. In this letter, we present the first
      continuous and scalable shock electrodialysis system and
      demonstrate the separation of sodium, chloride, and other ions
      from a feed stream. Our prototype continuously removes over 99%
      (and up to 99.99%) of salt from diverse electrolytes over a range
      of concentrations (1, 10, and 100 mM). The desalination data
      collapse with dimensionless current, scaled to charge advection in
      the feed stream. Enhanced water recovery with increasing current
      (up to 79%) is a fortuitous discovery, which we attribute to
      electro-osmotic pumping. These results suggest the feasibility of
      using shock electrodialysis for practical water purification
      applications.<br>

      A liquid electrolyte can be desalinated and purified using a
      system that includes a first electrode and a configuration
      selected from (a) a second electrode and at least one distinct
      ion-selective boundary and (b) a second electrode that also serves
      as the ion-selective boundary. The ion-selective boundary is
      contained in the liquid conduit adjacent to a porous medium that
      defines pore channels filled with the liquid and that have a
      surface charge, and the charge of the ion-selective boundary and
      the surface charge of the pore channels share the same sign. A
      liquid including at least one charged species flows through the
      pore channels, forming a thin diffuse electrochemical double layer
      at an interface of the liquid and the charged surface of the pore
      channels.; A voltage differential is applied between the
      electrodes across the porous medium to draw ions in the liquid to
      the electrodes to produce brine at the electrodes and to create a
      shock in the dissolved-ion concentration in the bulk volume of the
      liquid within the pore channels, wherein a depleted zone with a
      substantially reduced concentration of dissolved ions forms in the
      liquid bulk volume between the shock and the ion-selective
      boundary.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      In this century, the shortage of fresh water is expected to
      surpass the shortage of energy as a global concern for humanity,
      and these two challenges are inexorably linked. Fresh water is one
      of the most fundamental needs of humans and other organisms. Each
      human needs to consume a minimum of about two liters per day, in
      addition to greater fresh-water demands from farming as well as
      from industrial processes. Meanwhile, techniques for transporting
      fresh water or for producing fresh water via purification and
      desalination of seawater, brackish water, waste water,
      contaminated water, etc. tend to be highly demanding of increasing
      scarce supplies of affordable energy.<br>
      <br>
      The hazards posed by insufficient water supplies are particularly
      acute. A shortage of fresh water may lead to famine, disease,
      death, forced mass migration, cross-region conflict/war (from
      Darfur to the American southwest), and collapsed ecosystems. In
      spite of the criticality of the need for fresh water and the
      profound consequences of shortages, supplies of fresh water are
      particularly constrained. 97.5% of the water on Earth is salty,
      and about 70% of the remainder is locked up as ice (mostly in ice
      caps and glaciers), leaving only 0.75% of all water on Earth as
      available fresh water.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, that 0.75% of available fresh water is not evenly
      distributed. For example, heavily populated developing countries,
      such as India and China, have many regions that are subject to
      scarce supplies. Further still, the supply of fresh water is often
      seasonally inconsistent. Typically confined to regional drainage
      basins, water is heavy and its transport is expensive and
      energy-intensive.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, demands for fresh water are tightening across the
      globe. Reservoirs are drying up; aquifers are falling; rivers are
      drying; and glaciers and ice caps are retracting. Rising
      populations increase demand, as do shifts in farming and increased
      industrialization. Climate change poses even more threats in many
      regions. Consequently, the number of people facing water shortages
      is increasing.<br>
      <br>
      Even when fresh water is available, billions of people live with
      unacceptable levels of contamination. There is a growing need for
      water purification systems that can remove not only common ions,
      but also various dangerous trace impurities such as arsenic,
      copper, radioactive particles, fertilizers, bacteria, viruses,
      etc. many of which are difficult to eliminate efficiently with
      traditional filters and membranes. Cheap, low-power, portable
      systems could have a major impact on public health, if they could
      be easily deployed to remote or under-developed locations with
      poor or nonexistent water distribution infrastructure.<br>
      <br>
      Massive amounts of energy are typically needed to produce fresh
      water from seawater (or to a lesser degree, from brackish water),
      especially for remote locations. Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently
      the leading desalination technology, but it is energy intensive
      and still relatively inefficient due to the large pressures
      required to drive water through semi-permeable membranes and their
      tendency for fouling. In large-scale plants, the energy/volume
      required can be as low as 4 kWh/m&lt;3 &gt;at 30% recovery,
      compared to the theoretical minimum around 1 kWh/m&lt;3&gt;,
      although smaller-scale RO systems (e.g., aboard ships) can have
      much worse efficiency, by an order of magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than extracting pure water, electrochemical methods, such
      as electrodialysis (ED) and capacitive desalination (CD), extract
      just enough salt to achieve potable water (&lt;10 mM). Current
      large-scale electrochemical desalination systems are less
      efficient than RO plants at desalinating seawater (e.g., 7
      kWh/m&lt;3 &gt;is the state of the art in ED), but become more
      efficient for brackish water (e.g., CD can achieve 0.6
      kWh/m&lt;3&gt;). These electrochemical methods also offer
      advantages for efficient high-recovery purification of partially
      or completely desalinated water, by expending energy mainly to
      remove just the undesirable particles, rather than most of the
      water molecules, from the solution. Existing ED and CD methods,
      however, do not reach the same level of water purity as RO, since
      some undesirable particles can flow past the electrodes or
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Described herein are methods and apparatus for desalination (salt
      removal) and liquid purification (particulate removal) using
      macroscopic porous media and membranes, exploiting the formation
      of sharp gradients in salt concentration, which we call
      “desalination shocks”, driven by surface conduction and
      electro-osmotic flow. Various embodiments of the apparatus and
      method may include some or all of the elements, features and steps
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      In the apparatus, a conduit is provided for liquid flow
      therethrough, and at least two electrodes are configured to drive
      ionic current in liquid flowing from an inlet port to a
      desalinated/purified liquid outlet port in the conduit. At least
      one ion-selective boundary (e.g., ion-exchange membrane) is
      configured to conduct the ionic current and selectively transmit
      or remove counter-ions while blocking co-ions from the liquid, and
      at least one porous medium is adjacent to the ion-selective
      boundary (i.e., the porous medium is not necessarily in contact
      with the ion-selective boundary; though if separated, the
      separation distance is very small, of the order of the screening
      length, e.g., of the order of 2-100 nm in aqueous solutions) and
      on an opposite side of the ion-selective boundary from the second
      electrode in the conduit. The porous medium has a surface charge
      with a sign that is the same as the sign of the co-ions to enable
      conduction of an ionic surface current (in the double layers)
      carried by the counter-ions and consequent production of a region
      of desalinated/purified liquid, wherein the desalinated/purified
      liquid outlet port is positioned to extract the
      desalinated/purified liquid from the porous medium. The method and
      apparatus involve the formation of a sharp salt concentration
      gradient (i.e., a “desalination shock”) in a region of the porous
      medium near the membrane. The desalination shock enables
      membrane-less separation (i.e., where ions can be separated and
      removed in the porous medium without needing a physical barrier or
      membrane at the separation location). In this shock region, the
      rate of change in salt concentration as a function of distance
      from the membrane is substantially greater than it is elsewhere
      across the continuous pore channels in the porous medium. A
      depleted region of lower salinity (e.g., fresh water) is thereby
      produced in the bulk liquid between the shock region and the
      membrane. In addition to classical bulk diffusion, ion transport
      from the liquid is enhanced by surface conduction within the
      screening cloud (or double layers) within the pores, and the
      removal of, e.g., fresh water from the depleted region can be
      driven by electro-osmotic and/or pressure-driven flow.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, one of the electrodes can serve as the
      ion-selective boundary. For example, a porous metal electrode can
      store counterions capacitively in its double layers, while
      rejecting co-ions. An electrode undergoing electrodeposition of
      metal ions (or other electrochemical adsorption/deposition
      processes) can achieve the same result. In a particular example,
      the ion-selective boundary is a copper cathode that removes copper
      ions from a copper chloride aqueous solution in a packed bed of
      silica microspheres by electrodeposition. This removal of the
      copper ions triggers the same “desalination shock” phenomenon in
      the porous medium leading to over-limiting current and
      desalinating the copper chloride solution.<br>
      <br>
      Multiple assemblies can be stacked in parallel to boost the flow
      rate. As in traditional electrodialysis, brine can be produced in
      the electrode compartments by redox reactions and removed by
      pressure-driven flow, though the porous medium in this apparatus
      provides a new method of fresh water recovery and particle
      filtering.<br>
      <br>
      These methods and systems can be applied in low-cost, low-voltage,
      macroscopic systems to produce useful flow rates for both
      small-scale and large-scale applications and can be used with a
      variety of water sources, including seawater, brackish water,
      sewage, industrial wastewater, contaminated drinking water,
      oil-well wastewater and agricultural wastewater, or with other
      liquids. In one example, the apparatus is powered by a battery or
      by solar panels coupled with the system. Suitable applications
      include small-scale uses in remote regions with limited access to
      fresh water and energy and/or in the military, wherein the
      apparatus can be transported by individual soldiers or groups of
      soldiers, or in a vehicle. In other embodiments, the system can be
      coupled with the electrical grid for large-scale fresh-water
      production. The system can be used for a variety of purposes,
      including desalination and purification of sea water or brackish
      water, as well as ionic liquids or electrolytes that are not
      water-based (such as alcohol-based electrolytes, organic
      electrolytes, surfactant-stabilized colloids or micelles in
      non-polar solvents, etc.), or cleaning porous materials or soils
      by flowing a liquid therethrough and extracting ions and
      counter-ions from the porous material through the system.<br>
      <br>
      The methods and systems can also provide ultra-filtration with
      reduced membrane filtering; and fresh water produced with these
      methods and systems can be free of negatively charged impurities
      (such as most dirt and viruses), allowing only positively-charged
      particles that fit through the pores (e.g., having a diameter less
      than 100 nm) to pass through the shock region. Accordingly, the
      porous medium and shock region can also protect the membrane
      surface from fouling by preventing particles from reaching the
      membrane. The porous medium can also be of an inexpensive
      composition and, in particular embodiments, is easy to clean or
      replace (whereas, the membrane, if fouled, typically is
      comparatively difficult to clean and expensive to replace).<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 1 shows the basic elements of a desalination and

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIGS. 7 and 8 show periodic repetitions of the elements
        above in parallel stacks, to achieve larger flow rates. FIG. 7
        shows an alternating stack of combined elements from FIG. 5.
        FIG. 8 shows an alternating stack of the components in FIG. 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 9 shows a periodic repetition of structures comprising
        APM and CPM sandwiched between AEM and CEM.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 10 shows a sandwich structure of FIG. 9 with a plot of
        the transient salt concentration profile in one APM/CPM section.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 11 shows a stack of alternating CPM/CEM layers leading
        to membrane-less separation of salt in the CPM layers.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 12 shows a CPM sandwiched between two CEM layers with
        a plot of the steady salt concentration profile in the CPM.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 13 shows a cylindrical configuration of the system
        shown in FIG. 11.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 14 shows a cylindrical configuration of the system
        shown in FIG. 9.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 15 shows a system with a heterogeneous porous medium,
        wherein the shock region is pinned at the interface between a
        finer-pore zone and a larger-pore zone.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 16 shows a system with a heterogeneous porous medium
        that includes a lower-surface-charge zone and a
        higher-surface-charge zone.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 17 shows a first method of fresh water recovery by
        allowing fresh liquid to escape via a gap in the sidewall of the
        conduit near the CPM/CEM interface and over the depleted zone in
        the cationic porous medium.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 18 shows a complete shock membrane apparatus,
        exploiting the desalination method of FIG. 1 and the water
        recovery method of FIG. 17. A weak pressure-driven flow is
        imposed (e.g., by gravity) to remove brine from the anode and
        cathode compartments and augment the electro-osmotic flow
        through the cationic porous medium driving fresh liquid out near
        the cation exchange membrane.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 19 shows a second method and apparatus of water
        recovery, using transverse-pressure-driven flow in the cationic
        porous medium. The shock traverses some or all of the cationic
        porous medium while bending in the flow, and the depletion zone
        extends to the side of the cationic porous medium, where fresh
        liquid is removed.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 20 shows another method and apparatus for water
        recovery, again using pressure-driven flow—here with both
        anionic-porous-medium and cationic-porous-medium elements in
        contact. The two shocks emanating from the two membranes collide
        prior to the side exit to allow easy removal of fresh liquid.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 21 shows an embodiment of the apparatus in FIG. 17,
        including a sandwich of the different elements, cut to have the
        same cross section and glued together.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 22 shows a third method of water recovery, wherein one
        membrane-and-electrode assembly, the CEM/cathode (or AEM/anode),
        is placed on the side of the porous cationic (or anionic) porous
        medium, transverse to the other electrode, the anode (or
        cathode). The geometry allows electro-osmotic flow transverse to
        the membrane to contribute directly to water recovery, aided by
        possible pressure-driven flow along the same axis.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 23 shows another embodiment of the apparatus of FIG.
        22, where the CPM/CEM/cathode assembly has the form of a coaxial
        tube. Fresh water emerges along the axis from the opposite end
        of the cationic-porous-medium core, while brine is produced in
        the outer annulus of the tube from the cathode, as well as on
        the front end of the tube, from the anode.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 24 shows the liquid flows for the system illustrated
        in FIG. 14.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIGS. 25 and 26 illustrate the trade-off between flow rate
        and desalination factor via the slow flow rate in FIG. 25, which
        allows the shock to extend past the outlet into the brine
        channel, in comparison with the high flow rate in FIG. 26, which
        causes the shock to leave the porous medium in the fresh water
        outlet, along with salty or unpurified input fluid.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIGS. 27 and 28 illustrate the trade-off between water
        recovery (Qfresh/Qin) and desalination factor by controlling the
        outlet flow rate ratio (Qfresh/Qbrine), wherein FIG. 27 shows
        excellent desalination at low water recovery (and at high energy
        cost/volume), while the system in FIG. 28 produces much more
        salt in the fresh water outlet with high water recovery.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 29 illustrates principles of water purification by
        desalination shocks. Large particles are filtered by size before
        entering the porous medium. Sufficiently small co-ionic
        particles end up rejected by charge to the brine outlet stream.
        Only sufficiently small counterion-ionic particles can make it
        to the fresh outlet stream.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 30 shows another embodiment of the element in FIG. 1,

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The foregoing and other features and advantages of various aspects
      of the invention(s) will be apparent from the following,
      more-particular description of various concepts and specific
      embodiments within the broader bounds of the invention(s). Various
      aspects of the subject matter introduced above and discussed in
      greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways,
      as the subject matter is not limited to any particular manner of
      implementation. Examples of specific implementations and
      applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Unless otherwise defined, used or characterized herein, terms that
      are used herein (including technical and scientific terms) are to
      be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their
      accepted meaning in the context of the relevant art and are not to
      be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless
      expressly so defined herein. For example, if a particular
      composition is referenced, the composition may be substantially,
      though not perfectly pure, as practical and imperfect realities
      may apply; e.g., the potential presence of at least trace
      impurities (e.g., at less than 1 or 2% by weight or volume) can be
      understood as being within the scope of the description; likewise,
      if a particular shape is referenced, the shape is intended to
      include imperfect variations from ideal shapes, e.g., due to
      machining tolerances.<br>
      <br>
      Although the terms, first, second, third, etc., may be used herein
      to describe various elements, these elements are not to be limited
      by these terms. These terms are simply used to distinguish one
      element from another. Thus, a first element, discussed below,
      could be termed a second element without departing from the
      teachings of the exemplary embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      Spatially relative terms, such as “above,” “upper,” “beneath,”
      “below,” “lower,” and the like, may be used herein for ease of
      description to describe the relationship of one element to another
      element, as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that
      the spatially relative terms, as well as the illustrated
      configurations, are intended to encompass different orientations
      of the apparatus in use or operation in addition to the
      orientations described herein and depicted in the figures. For
      example, if the apparatus in the figures is turned over, elements
      described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would
      then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the
      exemplary term, “above,” may encompass both an orientation of
      above and below. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (e.g.,
      rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially
      relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Further still, in this disclosure, when an element is referred to
      as being “on,” “connected to” or “coupled to” another element, it
      may be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or
      intervening elements may be present unless otherwise specified.<br>
      <br>
      The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
      particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting of
      exemplary embodiments. As used herein, singular forms, such as “a”
      and “an,” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless
      the context indicates otherwise. Additionally, the terms,
      “includes,” “including,” “comprises” and “comprising,” specify the
      presence of the stated elements or steps but do not preclude the
      presence or addition of one or more other elements or steps.<br>
      <br>
      In the following examples, we assume without loss of generality
      that the liquid is water containing dissolved salts and charged
      impurities to be removed by the apparatus and methods described
      herein. It will be understood that the same apparatus and methods
      can be applied by those skilled in the art to other liquids
      containing dissolved ions and/or charged impurity particles. Some
      examples are given below, after embodiments are specified, in
      detail, for the applications dealing with desalination and
      purification of aqueous solutions.<br>
      <br>
      A desalination and purification system 10 is shown in FIG. 1. A
      cationic porous medium (CPM) 12 with negatively charged pore
      channels 14 is in contact with a cation exchange membrane (CEM)
      16. A liquid including co-ions and oppositely charged
      counter-ions, charged impurities and/or charged droplets flows
      left-to-right as shown through the cationic porous medium 12.
      Direct electric current is passed from the cationic porous medium
      12 through the cation exchange membrane 16, and a desalination
      shock forms at the CPM/CEM interface and propagates into the
      cationic porous medium 12, leaving behind a depleted region of
      fresh water (the term, “fresh water,” as used herein, can
      represent potable water having less than approximately 10 mM of
      dissolved salts). Particles suspended in the input stream are also
      rejected by size or charge at the entrance to the cationic porous
      medium (at the left side of the cationic porous medium 12 in FIG.
      1) and are further rejected by the shock within the cationic
      porous medium 12. The direction of flow for anions and cations in
      the system are shown with respective arrows. Though a gap for
      liquid flow is shown here between the anode 19 and the cationic
      porous medium 12, the anode 19 and cationic porous medium 12 can
      be in flush contact in other embodiments, and the source liquid
      can be directly injected into the porous medium 12.<br>
      <br>
      The porous medium 12 has a rigid structure and has ideally a high
      surface charge. In one embodiment, the cationic porous medium 12
      is a porous glass frit with approximately 1-micron pores, and the
      cation exchange membrane 16 is formed of a
      sulfonated-tetrafluroethyele-based fluoropolymer-copolymer
      (commercially available as a NAFION membrane from E. I. du Pont de
      Nemours and Company), which is assembled together with a porous
      cathode 18. Alternatively, the cationic porous medium 12 can take
      many other naturally occurring or artificially fabricated forms,
      such as the following:<br>
      <br>
      electrochemically prepared porous materials, such as anodic
      aluminum oxide with parallel nanopores;<br>
      fused or packed beds of silica beads, latex spheres, or other
      colloid particles (see embodiment, discussed below);<br>
      zeolite materials;<br>
      other types of porous glass or ceramic frits;<br>
      porous polymer materials,<br>
      functionalized polymers with large negative surface charge,<br>
      cross linked polymers; or<br>
      porous metals or semiconductors with oxide coatings.<br>
      The cationic porous medium 12 can also be made from any of the
      following:<br>
      polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),<br>
      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),<br>
      other elastomeric materials,<br>
      etched or milled glass,<br>
      silicon or other semiconductors, or<br>
      other solid materials with micro/nano-fabricated artificial pore
      networks extending therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      The porous material may also contain ion-exchange resins or
      nanoporous materials to enhance counterion conductivity to the
      counterion-selective boundary. This will promote desalination
      shocks leading to strong salt depletion in the larger pores if the
      conduction paths for counterions have few interruptions. If,
      however, as in packed beds of ion-exchangers, the conduction paths
      terminate and produce transient enrichment and depletion regions
      at the pore scale, then mixing due to concentration polarization
      and nonlinear electro-osmotic flows can prevent the formation of
      desalination shocks, or cause them to widen, thereby lowering
      their salt separation efficiency. For this reason, particular
      embodiments include porous materials that have pore thicknesses
      that mostly fall into an optimal range of negligible double-layer
      overlap and suppressed convection within the pores (e.g., 100 nm
      to 10 microns in aqueous solutions). The microstructure can also
      be anisotropic to optimize surface conduction to the membrane,
      while allowing for transverse flow to extract the desalinated
      fluid, as described below.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the cationic porous medium 12 is a
      packed bed of microspheres formed, e.g., of silica or latex. The
      microspheres can be loaded by flow into a tube 58 and condensed
      toward the end by centrifuge. This method also allows for easy
      porosity grading or other control of the spatial variation in
      microstructure of the cationic porous medium 12, by varying the
      loading strategy or type of particles. For example, finer
      particles can be employed (thereby reducing pore volume) in
      regions of the system where restricted fluid flow is desired.
      Accordingly, the packed bed of particles can have non-uniform
      porosity, surface charge, or microstructure on a scale at least an
      order of magnitude greater than average particle diameter to
      promote increased liquid flow through particular regions of the
      system. In other embodiments, the surface charge or microstructure
      can be substantially varied in different regions to control the
      spatial distribution of fluid flow through the system. Pressure
      buildup, however, may disrupt the packing and interfere with
      stable shock formation.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the same types of materials can also be used in an anionic
      porous medium 13 (see FIG. 5), with positive surface charge, such
      as positively charged polymeric porous materials, positively
      charged self-assembled monolayers or thin films on porous
      substrates, or artificially prepared surfaces by polymeric
      layer-by-layer deposition, starting from any of the cationic
      porous media listed above. With any of these cases of cationic or
      anionic porous media, the surface charge, surface ionic mobility,
      and/or electro-osmotic slip mobility can be enhanced by surface
      treatments, films, coatings, or self-assembled molecular layers.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate the principles behind the formation of the
      desalination shock, a channel for electrolyte liquid flow through
      the pore channels 14 in the cationic porous medium 12 is shown in
      FIGS. 3 and 4. As shown in FIG. 3, the pore walls 20 of the
      cationic porous medium 12 have a negative charge and attract
      excess positive ions from the liquid to form double layers 24 at
      the interfaces of the pore walls 20 and the liquid 22. Typically,
      the double layers 24 are thin compared to the channel thickness.
      The pore channels have a sufficient diameter, hp (e.g., at least
      50 nm in water, or more generally, greater than the Debye length),
      to prevent overlap of double layers on opposite sides of the pore
      channel. The liquid volume 26 bounded by the double layers 24 is
      termed the “bulk liquid.” More precisely, when the excess salt in
      the double layers 24, relative to the quasi-neutral solution, is
      subtracted, what remains is the effective volume of bulk
      electrolyte 26 filling the pores. As shown, the pore size, hp, is
      greater than the Debye screening length, λD; and λD is below 1 nm
      in seawater and can be as large as 100 nm in deionized water.<br>
      <br>
      The pore channel 14 can be conceptually divided into three
      regions, as shown in FIG. 4. The liquid in the bulk volume 26 has
      a high charge content, or ionic conductivity, on the left side (as
      shown) where the initial liquid is introduced; as a result,
      electric current flows primarily through the bulk liquid here. In
      the center is a “shock region” 28 in which current flows shift
      from being primarily in the bulk liquid volume 26 (on the left
      side) to being primarily in the double layer 24 (to the right).
      The bulk liquid volume 26′ in the region 30 to the right of the
      shock region 28 is depleted (i.e., has a very low content of
      charged ions, particles or droplets); consequently, the electrical
      resistance in the bulk liquid volume 26′ in the depleted region 30
      is lower than the electrical resistance along the double-layer
      interface 24. Accordingly, this depleted bulk liquid volume 26′
      can be regarded as being desalinated and/or purified compared with
      the initial liquid fed into the system 10. The fundamental
      mechanism for the formation of the depleted region 30 is surface
      conduction through the double layers 24, which becomes
      increasingly important compared to classical diffusion in the bulk
      liquid 26/26′, as the salt concentration is reduced by the
      ion-selective surface (of the membrane 16 or electrode 18). The
      basic physics of desalination shocks are described in A. Mani and
      M. Z. Bazant, “Desalination Shocks in Microstructures,” which was
      included in the parent provisional application (U.S. Ser. No.
      61/356,769).<br>
      <br>
      An alternative embodiment of the system is shown in FIG. 5,
      wherein the pore walls 20 of an anionic porous medium 13 have a
      positive charge, thereby attracting a thin layer of negatively
      charged ions from the liquid 22 at the interface of the pore walls
      20 and the liquid 22. In this embodiment, the membrane is an
      anionic exchange membrane 17 to facilitate the transport of
      negatively charged ions therethrough. During the passage of direct
      current from the anion exchange membrane through the anionic
      porous medium, a desalination shock forms in the porous medium,
      again leaving behind a depleted zone of desalinated and purified
      (“fresh”) liquid (e.g., fresh water).<br>
      <br>
      In additional embodiments, as shown in FIG. 6, a combination of
      cationic and anionic shock elements, including both cationic and
      anionic exchange membranes 16 and 17 and adjacent porous media 12
      and 13 can be provided. These elements can be periodically
      repeated in a stack configuration. Though gaps are shown between
      the cationic porous medium 12 and the anionic porous medium 13 in
      FIGS. 6 and 7; these layers can be in direct contact in other
      embodiments. Stacked configurations are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.
      The stacked system of FIG. 7 includes both anionic and cationic
      media and membranes, while the stacked system of FIG. 8 includes
      only cationic media and membranes, along with anodes 19 and
      cathode 18.<br>
      <br>
      Another stack configuration is shown in FIG. 9, which includes a
      serial repetition of sandwiches of an integrally coupled anionic
      porous medium 13 and a cationic porous medium 12 between an anion
      exchange membrane 17 and a cation exchange membrane 16, wherein
      negative charges flow to the left toward the anode 19 and positive
      charges flow to the right toward the cathode 18. This structure
      is, in some ways, similar to a standard electrodialysis structure,
      except that the dialysate channels are filled with anionic porous
      medium 13/cationic porous medium 12 sandwich structures. In
      contrast to electrodialysis, these porous media are used to
      produce desalination shocks that drive localized “membrane-less”
      desalination and purification processes within the porous media.<br>
      <br>
      One anionic porous medium 13/cationic porous medium 12 sandwich
      structure from FIG. 9 is shown in FIG. 10 along with the transient
      salt concentration profile across the structure at constant
      current. The following four regions are shown in the corresponding
      plot of salt concentration (c0) versus horizontal coordinate:
      region 63 (initial depletion by diffusion), region 65 (shock
      propagation), region 67 (shock collision), and region 69
      (exponential relaxation to complete desalination).<br>
      <br>
      A stack of alternating cationic porous media 12/cation exchange
      membranes 16 are shown in FIG. 11, wherein anions migrate across
      the layers toward the anode 19, while cations migrate toward the
      cathode 18. This embodiment exemplifies “membrane-less separation”
      of salt in the cationic porous media 12 layers, as shown in FIG.
      12. In FIG. 12, one layer of porous medium 12 from FIG. 11 is
      shown sandwiched between a pair of adjoining cation exchange
      membranes 16, and the salt concentration across this structure is
      plotted above. As shown in the plot, a depletion (desalinated)
      zone 30 of relatively pure water is formed on the right side of
      the cationic porous medium 12, while a brine zone 35 with a high
      salt concentration is formed on the left side of the cationic
      porous medium 12. The initial salt concentration (c0) of the
      liquid is shown with the hashed line in the plot. This embodiment
      clearly shows the difference between desalination shock
      propagation and standard electrodialysis because it uses only one
      type of membrane, augmented by a porous material of the same
      surface charge. The desalination shock phenomenon leads to
      depletion of both cations and anions in the same location. In
      contrast, electrodialysis involves two different types of
      membranes, a cation-exchange membrane of negative internal charge
      to extract the cations and anion-exchange membrane of positive
      internal charge to extract the anions.<br>
      <br>
      The various designs shown herein can be fabricated with the same
      sequence of structures along the current path but in alternative
      geometries. For example, the structure of FIG. 11 is reconfigured
      in FIG. 13 into a cylindrical configuration, while the structure
      of FIG. 9 is likewise reconfigured into a cylindrical
      configuration in FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      In the various systems shown herein, heterogeneous porous
      materials (with spatially varying properties) can be used to
      control the location of the shock. For example, the shock 28 can
      be pinned at the interface between two regions of cationic porous
      media 12 with differently sized particles. As shown in FIG. 15,
      the top region 81 of the cationic porous medium can have larger
      particles and pores, while the bottom region 83 of the cationic
      porous medium can have finer particles and pores, with the shock
      28 pinned at the interface of regions 81 and 83. In the embodiment
      of FIG. 16, the shock 28 is pinned at the interface of a
      lower-surface-charge region 85 and a higher-surface-charge region
      87. In this way, the shock 28 can be “aimed” at splitting of the
      brine and fresh water outgoing streams (discussed, below), such
      that the desalinated liquid covers the fresh-water outlet, helping
      to optimize operation of the system.<br>
      <br>
      Recovery of desalinated water 32 is shown in FIG. 17. The recovery
      method exploits the pressure build-up in front of the membrane 16
      due to electro-osmotic flow to eject fresh water from the
      depletion zone 30, behind the shock region 28 and in front of the
      membrane 16. The flow 34 is driven by electro-osmosis, wherein the
      liquid flow 34 through the system 10 coincides with the electric
      current flow 36 in the system 10, though the liquid flow 34 can be
      augmented by a pressure-driven flow to enhance the flow rate
      through conduit 31. In this design, removal of desalinated water
      32 through outlet port 33 transverse to the current direction near
      the cation exchange membrane 16 may be enhanced by reduced
      porosity, increased pore size, or anisotropic porous
      microstructures of the cationic porous medium 12 in the region
      near the membrane 16 compared with elsewhere in the porous medium
      12. This shows the potential importance of graded or non-uniform
      microstructures in shock membrane systems.<br>
      <br>
      A system schematic diagram for shock desalination and purification
      using electro-osmotic flow (EO flow) is shown in FIG. 18, though
      the electro-osmotic flow can be supplemented with pressure-driven
      flow. Most impurity particles entrained in the incoming sea water
      or brackish water 38 fed through liquid inlet port 40 pass through
      the channel 50 between the anode 19 and the cationic porous media
      12 to a brine output 42 ejected through a waste liquid outlet port
      44. Additional impurity particles are filtered by the porous media
      12. Cationic ions in the liquid pass from left to right and exit
      through the cation exchange membrane 16 into channel 50 to a brine
      output 46 through outlet port 48. An additional pressure-driven
      liquid flow is provided through channel 50 flush the brine 46
      through the outlet port 48.<br>
      <br>
      Another method and system for water recovery driven by transverse
      pressure-driven flow (downward flow of sea water inputs 38, as
      illustrated, without EO flow) is shown in FIG. 19. The components
      of this system can also be periodically repeated in a parallel
      stack to boost flow rate. In this embodiment, the shock region 28
      angles diagonally across the cationic porous medium 12. In
      alternative embodiments, the gaps 50 adjacent to the anode 19 can
      be replaced with additional cationic porous medium; in particular
      embodiments, the additional cationic porous medium that replaces
      the gap can have a different porosity than the rest of the
      cationic porous medium 12.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the desalination and purification system
      including both cationic and anionic elements with no gap there
      between is shown in FIG. 20. Here, sea water 38 is pressure-driven
      into the system through inlet port 40; the inlet port 40 includes
      a filter 52 for screening out large particles 54 from entering the
      system. The sea water flows through downward through both the
      anionic porous medium 13 and the cationic porous medium 12.
      Smaller particles 56 that pass through the filter 52 at the inlet
      port 40 pass through channels 50 at the perimeter of the apparatus
      to flush out anions that pass through the (porous) anode 19 on the
      left and to flush out cations that pass through the (porous)
      cathode 18 on the right as brine output 46.<br>
      <br>
      In the recovery methods of FIGS. 17-20, there may be additional
      outlet ports for co-flowing waste water (ahead of the shock region
      28, away from the ion-selective surface), which is separated from
      the indicated outlet port for fresh water (behind the shock,
      closer to the ion-selective surface).<br>
      <br>
      A portable, low-power, small-scale embodiment of the shock
      desalination and purification system of FIG. 18 is shown in FIG.
      21. In this embodiment, the cationic porous media is porous glass
      frit with a pore size of 1 micron. The cation exchange membrane is
      a NAFION membrane, and the cathode is porous.<br>
      <br>
      Another method of water recovery, shown in FIG. 22, involves
      repositioning one electrode (e.g., the anode 19) to drive
      electro-osmotic flow, which can be enhanced by applied pressure,
      into a porous material (e.g., a cationic porous medium 12)
      surrounded by the membrane/electrode assembly (e.g., a
      cation-exchange membrane 16 and a cathode 18). A tubular
      configuration of this embodiment is shown in FIG. 23.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid flows for the system of FIG. 14 are shown in FIG. 24.
      At left, the input stream (e.g., sea water) 38 enters the system;
      and at right, desalinated and purified (fresh) water 32 is
      extracted between concentric flows of brine 42 and 46 from the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      System optimization based on a trade-off between flow rate and
      desalination factor is shown in FIGS. 25 and 26. A low flow rate
      is used in FIG. 25, wherein the shock 28 extends past the fresh
      water outlet 33 yielding good desalination (i.e., low salt
      concentration in the “fresh” water 32). At high flow rates, as
      shown in FIG. 26, the shock stays close to the cathode 18 and
      salty inlet water 38 ends up in the “fresh” water output 32
      exiting port 33. The slow flow system of FIG. 25 also has a power
      requirement that is higher than that of the fast flow system of
      FIG. 26.<br>
      <br>
      System optimization based on a trade-off between water recovery
      (Qfresh/Qin) and desalination (and power requirement) is shown in
      FIGS. 27 and 28 by controlling the outlet flow ratio
      (Qfresh/Qbrine), with Qin, I, etc., fixed. Low water recovery
      (Qfresh/Qin) is achieved in FIG. 27, though excellent desalination
      is achieved at high energy cost/volume. High water recovery
      (Qfresh/Qin) is achieved in FIG. 28, though a substantial amount
      of salt ends up in the fresh water output 32.<br>
      <br>
      Principles of water purification and disinfection by desalination
      shocks are illustrated in FIG. 29. In this embodiment, the
      cationic porous medium 12 provides (ultra) filtration by size. The
      shock 28 rejects anionic particles 57 into the brine output 42.
      Consequently, the fresh water output 32 from the system contains
      only very small positively charged particles, which tend to be
      rare in water. Alternatively, where an anionic porous medium is
      used, cationic particles are rejected into the brine output, and
      the fresh water output includes only very small negatively charged
      particles. Moreover, all particles reaching the fresh water outlet
      experience large electric fields (e.g., &gt;100 V/mm) in the low
      conductivity desalinated region behind the shock, thereby
      providing an effective means of disinfection. Such fields are
      sufficient to kill or neutralize living microorganisms, bacteria,
      fungi, spores, cells, viruses, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the outlet stream with higher concentrations
      of salt and co-ionic particles is a desirable product stream in
      continuous chemical processing, e.g., to produce more concentrated
      solutions of acids, electrolytes, colloidal particles, quantum
      dots, or small biological molecules or micro-organisms. In such
      embodiments, the lower concentration stream may be considered as
      waste.<br>
      <br>
      A schematic illustration of a shock desalination and purification
      system 10 is shown in FIG. 30. The components include a porous
      medium 12 in the form of silica glass frit with a mean pore size
      whose order of magnitude is 1 micron in water (somewhat larger
      than the maximum Debye length) and an electrode membrane assembly,
      wherein the membrane 16 is a 2-mm-thin NAFION membrane (NR-212).
      Fused quartz glasses are used as packaging materials. The size of
      this prototype system is about 1 cm×1 cm×2 cm
      (cross-section×length). In this embodiment, the liquid (e.g., sea
      water) 38 enters through an aperture in the anode 19 and exits
      through an aperture in the cathode 18; and a voltage source 62 is
      coupled with the anode 19 and with the cathode 18 to drive current
      through the system 10.<br>
      <br>
      In a simple, steady-state, one-dimensional model, an ionic
      solution is in porous media between an electrode and an
      ion-selective surface (membrane or electrode). The boundaries are
      assumed to be porous to allow for analyte flow, where the velocity
      is assumed to be uniform plug flow. At one end, the concentration
      of analyte is held constant; and at the other end, the cation is
      consumed by the ion-selective surface due to the applied current.
      Three dimensionless groups represent the physics in this model:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      where i is the applied current density, L is the distance between
      electrodes, D is the diffusivity, C0 is the original concentration
      of analyte, U is the flow velocity and s is the surface charge per
      volume of the pores.<br>
      <br>
      Numerical simulations based on this theory are presented, as
      follows. The plot in FIG. 31 shows how the conductivity profile,
      which is proportional to charge concentration, changes as higher
      voltages are applied between the two electrodes for a constant
      Peclet (Pe) number; the chart shows plots for the following
      voltages: 5.0 volts (plot 64), 1.0 volts (plot 66), 0.5 volts
      (plot 68), and 0.1 volts (plot 70). A potential is applied at x=1,
      and the cation species are consumed at a rate proportional to the
      resulting current. After the applied voltage reaches a critical
      value, a depleted region develops and grows with higher voltages.
      The plots in both FIGS. 31 and 32 are for a fixed surface charge
      density to initial bulk concentration ratio, γ, set to
      10&lt;−2&gt;. FIG. 32 shows the conductivity profile for Pe values
      of 0 (plot 72), 5 (plot 74), and 10 (plot 76), where voltage
      remains constant, though flow rate is varied. As the dimensionless
      velocity, Pe, increases, the depleted region contracts toward the
      membrane. If the flow rate continues to increase, the depleted
      region will disappear altogether.<br>
      <br>
      Classically, when super-limiting currents are applied, the
      resulting voltage will increase towards infinity as the system
      tries to satisfy the applied boundary condition. However, based on
      this theory, under the right conditions, the applied voltage will
      level off to a stable, steady-state value, as seen in FIG. 33.
      This figure includes V-I curves for varying surface charge
      densities ( ) and Pe numbers. Specifically, surface charge
      densities (and Peclet numbers are plotted as follows:<br>
      <br>
      =0.0001 and Pe=0 (plot 78), =0.0001 and Pe=5 (plot 80), and
      =0.0001 and Pe=10 (plot 82),<br>
      =0.001 and Pe=0 (plot 84), =0.001 and Pe=5 (plot 86), and =0.001
      and Pe=10 (plot 88),<br>
      =0.01 and Pe=0 (plot 90), =0.01 and Pe=5 (plot 92), and =0.01 and
      Pe=10 (plot 94),<br>
      =0.1 and Pe=0 (plot 96), =0.1 and Pe=5 (plot 98), and =0.1 and
      Pe=10 (plot 100).<br>
      <br>
      The jump in voltage corresponds to a depletion region developing.
      As Pe increases, the overall behavior remains the same; but the
      location of the “jump” (i.e., a voltage plateau) occurs at higher
      currents. As surface charge, decreases, the system approaches the
      classic case of diffusion-limited current, where the voltage goes
      to infinity.<br>
      <br>
      With the development of steady-state depletion regions, where the
      depleted region represents desalinated water, this method may be
      used for desalination. To evaluate the viability of this method
      for water desalination, the energy/volume of a sample system was
      considered. A simple one-dimensional model was used to predict the
      energy efficiency (contour lines) of purification via a shock
      membrane for seawater desalination for different applied voltages
      at different flow rates, or Peclet numbers, UL/D. In FIG. 34,
      energy/volume is plotted under varying conditions for 0.5M
      saltwater. The theoretical energy/volume limit is 1 kWh/m&lt;3
      &gt;and is represented by the left-most line 102. Line 104 is the
      contour of 4 kWhr/m&lt;3&gt;, which is the best case scenario for
      reverse osmosis. The straight, angled lines are contours of the
      degree of depletion at the end of the channel, where the lines
      represent from 1% depleted (line 106), 0.1% depleted (line 108),
      and 0.01% depleted (line 110). In order to achieve higher
      depletion, higher voltages or lower velocities can be employed.
      These lines, in conjunction with the physical limit of about 1V
      (in water), demonstrate some of the design constraints for this
      problem. While this method could compete with reverse osmosis at
      low flow rates, it may also be beneficial to create a small,
      portable system with higher water production for a slightly higher
      energy cost.<br>
      <br>
      The larger the surface charge ( ) on the porous material is, the
      stronger the nonlinear force will be, resulting in higher currents
      at lower voltages. In FIG. 33, the voltage vs. current curves
      increase sharply as the system approaches depletion (around I=1
      for Pe=0), and then the slope decreases corresponding to the
      depleted region. The value of the voltages in the depleted region
      can change over orders of magnitude depending on the surface
      charge. As a result, it is advantageous to use a porous material
      with a high surface charge.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, under optimal conditions, a desalination system
      would not be run with large depletion regions. It is more
      efficient (see FIG. 34) to operate under the lowest voltages
      possible. Therefore, the system can be optimized so that the
      depletion region is as small as possible while still maintaining
      good water recovery by balancing flow rate and applied voltage.
      Increasing the flow rate improves efficiency and decreases the
      depleted region (see FIGS. 31 and 32), making water recovery
      difficult. Increasing the applied voltage increases the depletion
      region but decreases the efficiency. Consequently, optimization of
      water production and efficiency may depend on these factors.<br>
      <br>
      Though water desalination and purification have been specifically
      discussed, the systems and methods can likewise be used with other
      liquids in other contexts, such as for the segregation of
      surfactant-stabilized colloids or inverse micelles in a non-polar
      solvent, where an electrode is substituted for the membrane. For
      example, electrophoretic displays, such as the displays produced
      by E-Ink (Cambridge, Mass.) for the Amazon Kindle electronic
      reader include black and white, oppositely charged colloidal
      particles suspended in a liquid near a transparent electrode. When
      a voltage is applied, black or white particles crowd on the
      electrodes and change the color of the “pixel.” The pixel is a set
      of oil droplets squashed between parallel plate electrodes.
      Accordingly, the electrolyte in this embodiment is a non-aqueous,
      non-polar solvent. The charged particles can be either
      surfactant-stabilized colloids, which would not dissolve in oil
      without the surfactant molecules, or inverse micelles (i.e.,
      clumps of surfactants). In this context, the system can be used to
      reduce/control the concentration of charged particles in a
      controlled way, in a large-scale continuous process, e.g., in the
      production of electronic inks.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the methods and apparatus of the invention
      can be used to continuously produce an outlet stream of increased
      concentration of dissolved salts or small, charged impurities,
      such as nanoparticles, quantum dots, colloidal particles, organic
      molecules, minerals, biological molecules, small proteins, DNA,
      microorganisms, cells, and viruses. The higher concentration of
      salt or impurities can be used to enhance the sensitivity (signal
      to noise ratio) of detection methods downstream of the device. The
      same method and apparatus can also be used to continuously
      increase the concentration of charged particles in chemical
      mixtures, colloids, electrolytes, acids, etc., in applications
      such as water softening, food processing, and chemical production.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the methods and apparatus of the invention
      can be used in conjunction with an electrodeposition/dissolution
      cell, where the ion-selective surfaces are electrodes rather than
      ion-exchange membranes. For example, the electrolyte can be an
      aqueous solution of cupric chloride (CuCl2), and the
      cation-exchange membrane can be replaced by a metallic copper
      cathode, polarized by an applied voltage to deposit copper from
      solution (Cu&lt;+2&gt;+2 e&lt;−&gt;→Cu). The anode can also be
      made of copper, and the reverse reaction (dissolution) will occur
      in response to the voltage to produce cupric ions. In this
      situation, a cationic porous medium placed in contact with the
      cathode will lead to the formation of desalination shocks and
      allow the passage of over-limiting (or super-limiting) current.
      This system will also deplete the salt concentration and remove
      impurities from the region between the shock and the electrode.
      The same procedure can be applied to any electrochemical cell,
      wherein electrodes act as ion-selective surfaces depleting the
      local salt concentration.<br>
      <br>
      In other embodiments, the methods and apparatus can be used for
      disinfection. The electric fields can be very large near the shock
      region 28 where water is extracted. Most biological impurities
      have negative charge in water and will be rejected by charge and
      by size from a cationic porous medium 12. Accordingly, biological
      organisms can be removed from the liquid stream using this
      apparatus and methods. Likewise, other contaminants, such as heavy
      ions, can be removed from a liquid stream using the apparatus and
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental:</b><br>
      <br>
      Our basic strategy to extract pure water behind desalination
      shocks is illustrated in FIGS. 30 and 35-37, along with the first
      experimental prototype. The experimental setup, as shown in the
      schematic illustration of FIG. 30, includes a sandwich structure
      of a 1-mm-thick, 1-cm-radius porous silica glass frit 12
      (commercially available with submicron pores—in this case, with
      pore widths ranging from 50 nm to 1 micron) against a NAFION
      membrane 16, supported by a plastic mesh with solution reservoirs
      50 leading to metal electrodes on either side. The frit/membrane
      assembly is packed in a hard plastic with screws to form tight
      seals at the outer edges. Fresh water 32 is continuously extracted
      from the depleted zone 30 within the glass frit 12, which passes
      over-limiting current through the NAFION membrane 16. Brine 42 and
      46 is produced in the anode and cathode compartments 50 and
      removed by a slow pressure-driven flow. A cross-sectional CAD
      drawing of the structure is provided in FIGS. 35 and 36.<br>
      <br>
      For continuous water extraction, a ̃100-micron-thick circular
      orifice on the frit side wall up to the membrane interface leads
      to an O-ring channel where fresh water collects before it proceeds
      through an outlet valve 33. The outlet flow 32 can be precisely
      controlled by a syringe pump with velocity precision down to
      microns/sec, although eventually the device may operate using
      spontaneously generated electro-osmotic flows in the glass frit
      12, without needing any externally applied pressure. Solution
      conductivities in different locations are measured by impedance
      spectroscopy, either by extracting a sample into a capillary with
      electrode caps, or by making electrical measurements with in situ
      electrodes. pH levels will also be monitored.<br>
      <br>
      As a model system with simple chemistry, a prototype apparatus,
      shown in FIG. 37, was used in first experiments involving aqueous
      copper sulfate solutions with copper electrodes 18 and 19
      undergoing deposition/dissolution reactions. In that case, the
      copper cathode 18 is in direct contact with the membrane/frit
      assembly, and we find that uniform deposition occurs without
      forming dendrites up to several volts. The anode 19 is a copper
      ring on the other side of the anodic reservoir feeding the glass
      frit from the back. In a more general setup, the electrodes are
      separated from the reservoirs and catalyze water electrolysis
      reactions away from the membrane, as in electrodialysis systems.<br>
      <br>
      The preliminary copper sulfate results in FIGS. 38-40 are
      promising and show good agreement with our theoretical
      predictions. The observed current-voltage relation in steady state
      with zero net fluid flow fit our analytical formula, thus
      supporting the hypothesis of over-limiting current carried by
      surface conduction in our submicron channels. This is already an
      important result, since we have demonstrated over-limiting current
      by a new mechanism in a nano-porous medium where convection is
      suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      Our first proof-of-concept desalination experiment to extract
      water from copper sulfate solution in the frit was also
      successful, using only 1.5 Volts. A simple measure of the energy
      efficiency from the data yields the following:
      energy/volume=power/flow rate=(2 mA*1.5V)/(2 μL/min)=23
      kWh/m&lt;3&gt;, which is satisfactory considering that the process
      had not yet been optimized.<br>
      <br>
      The data from our first attempt at continuous desalination of
      “brackish copper sulfate” (100 mM) is shown in FIG. 38, showing
      the conductivity decrease by up to a factor of 20 at low flow
      rates (down to “potable” levels) in a device with a 500 micron gap
      on a 1 mm glass frit. Using a smaller gap should dramatically
      improve the energy efficiency and concentration reduction. FIGS.
      39 and 40 plot the impedance spectra for the input and output
      solutions, respectively via copper probe electrodes showing the
      increase in bulk resistance before and after passing through the
      device, indicating strong depletion of the mobile ions.<br>
      <br>
      In this first device, the outlet gap of 500 microns (half of the
      frit thickness of 1 mm) was overly wide, thereby allowing much of
      the concentrated diffusion layer to exit the frit along with the
      depleted zone. As a result, the salt (copper sulfate)
      concentration was only reduced by a factor of 20 from brackish
      levels (100 mM) to potable levels (&lt;10 mM), but we expect
      better results from a planned device with a 100 micron gap. The
      theory predicts that the depleted zone will reach a salt
      concentration comparable to the number of surface charges per
      volume in the porous medium, which is &lt;0.1mM.<br>
      <br>
      A simple conservation analysis for thin desalination shocks gives
      an ultimate efficiency of E/V=P/Q≈t_c0eV, where t_is the co-ion
      transference number, c0 the salt concentration, and V the applied
      voltage. For small applied voltages, near the thermal voltage V=25
      mV, the predicted energy density of shock-membrane purification
      approaches the thermodynamic lower bound, set by the osmotic
      pressure (0.7 kWh/m&lt;3 &gt;for seawater). In this limit,
      however, the shock width becomes comparable to the depletion zone
      width, which interferes with the recovery of the fresh water, due
      to excessive mixing of the fresh and salty regions, which makes
      sense, since we cannot beat thermodynamics. Careful engineering of
      this system, however, will help to optimize the trade-off between
      efficiency, flow rate, and water recovery, and reach useful
      performance metrics for applications.<br>
