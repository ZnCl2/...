      <p>The Marcus Device is a claimed anti-gravity device. Marcus
        Hollingshead is said to have invented a rotating magnetic field
        device. </p>
      <p>Marcus Hollingshead is a British inventor who in November 2002
        claimed to have developed a device capable of overcoming the
        force of gravity. He referred to this effect as gravitational
        lensing as he thought the term anti-gravity inaccurate. However,
        the veracity of Hollingshead's claims are in question despite
        approximately 30 pages of detailed construction and experimental
        notes posted to online groups. During that time he was at the
        center of intense scrutiny and became something of a phenomenon
        in alt.sci (alternative science) arenas. Hollingshead's claims
        were unusual in that he: </p>
      <p>1. Claimed to have invented (and tested at the University of
        Cambridge) a 160 kg working prototype (iteration #161) capable
        of lifting 2040 Kg of weight while utilizing 4.1 kVA of power
        (about 5.6 horsepower). </p>
      <p>2. Publicly posted detailed written descriptions (but no
        photos) of the dimensions, materials and construction techniques
        employed to construct the most recent versions of his device.
        Several individuals generated 3D computer visualizations from
        his instructions and found the dimensions to be consistent. </p>
      <p>3. Claimed that the original intent of the device was not
        "antigravity" (a term he disliked) but to model geomagnetic
        forces in the Earth, and that as an inventor he professed no
        real idea of the theoretical physics behind its operation. </p>
      <p>Hollingshead first became known by posting results of his
        experiments on the BBC science message boards in November of
        2002. He claimed that he had created a device that accidentally
        had collapsed a Black and Decker Workmate table. After modifying
        and restarting, it allegedly lifted off from his workbench. </p>
      <p>The configuration of the devices #161 and #162 (generically
        known to Hollingshead as "bob") was six rings arranged in three
        pairs, each interlinked pair slightly offset from each other and
        centered around one of three axes: X, Y or Z. The rings in each
        pair were counter-rotated at 4200 rpm. Rings were wound with
        wire in a bifilar/caduceus manner. Twelve stubs, coil-wound
        short lengths of rods with flat points, were attached to the
        inner circumference of each ring and pointed inward. </p>
      <p>At the center of the device was positioned a charged
        multi-layered spherical capacitor (called the RP, for Reference
        Point). Each coil ring had its own drive and power supply and
        was powered through a continuous electrical contact. Power to
        the stub coils was separate from the rings and capable of being
        timed to coincide with the approach and retreat from its closest
        point to the RP. </p>
      <p>Hollingshead posted that if all the rings are powered and spun
        in balance there is no net movement of the device. However, a
        spherical field would form around it, noticeably darkening and
        blurring the contained zone to a point where the RP is no longer
        distinguishable and producing a shell coronal effect
        (purple/violet) in the dark. This field was one of the first
        non-propulsive "HAFF" fields produced by the device. It has been
        suggested but not verified that the acronym HAFF may stand for
        Hollingshead Anomalous Force Fields, of which Hollingshead
        reports there are seven. </p>
      <p><i>Reported Field Effects</i> </p>
      <p>Hollingshead describes several distinct field effects produced
        by his devices. Below is a collection of effects in
        Hollingshead's own words as reportedby Tim Ventura in American
        Antigravity </p>
      <p><i>Shield Effect</i> </p>
      <p>The shield effect is a slowly expanded spherical field that is
        produced by an altered rp and slower increased power and spin
        changes. This is complete enough a field to form a vacuum and
        strong enough to be hit with a rubber mallet and chair. </p>
      <p><i>Tractor Effect</i> </p>
      <p>It's possible to produce a 'pull' field effect as well as a
        'push'. So far I've been able to focus it for a short period of
        time on a 5 inch cube of wood 1.8 metres away and then drag the
        wood back towards the device by 30cm or so, by decreasing the
        focus range but keeping the power stable. </p>
      <p><i>Temperature Effect</i> </p>
      <p>There are some things that you have to keep an eye out for,
        such as icing up of the rp - but I hope to correct that by
        heating the outer shell as per a suggestion by Colin. </p>
      <p><i>Vacuum Effect</i> </p>
      <p>Vacuum is a deliberate effect of a slowly increased spherical
        shield, not normally present in moving variants. </p>
      <p><i>Gravity Effect</i> </p>
      <p>The device acts to produce a regular gravitational field - the
        field strength is increased until there is equivalence with
        earths gravitational influence. Power beyond that is 'lensed' to
        produce movement the lensing is caused by increasing power above
        G threshold in one or more of the coils (providing they are not
        opposites). </p>
      <p>Hollingshead reported that if the device were powered up and
        power to a ring pair were increased, then movement of the device
        would occur in that direction, even when the direction was
        counter to the force of gravity. </p>
      <p><i>Speculative Physics</i> </p>
      <p>In his audio interview with Tim Ventura in September of 2004
        Hollingshead says that there are changes in the nucleus of the
        iron atoms within the RP (composed of layers of purified iron
        and kapton as the dielectric). The forces "push protons into
        becoming neutrons" and soon the iron core is no longer pure
        iron. </p>
      <p>Note:&nbsp; it is true that an antineutrino (nubar ?-)
        colliding with a proton (p+) will yield a neutron (n0) and a
        positron (e+), or, ?- + 1p+ —&gt; 1no + oe+. If a positron
        speeds away, there must be something that flies out in the
        opposite direction, since it has been determined that the
        positron momentum is not balanced by recoil of the proton. A
        neutrino, answering this requirement, is thus also emitted. This
        suggests the iron atoms become an isotope of manganese. </p>
      <p>The result, says Hollingshead, is the release of energy and
        production of a local gravity lensing effect. However he reports
        that the diminution of iron in the RP results in nuclear
        byproducts and a reliable gravity lensing effect for a duration
        of only 2,000 hours. </p>
      <p>Iron comes in four stable isotopes, the most common of which is
        Fe-56, comprising 91.7% of most terrestrial samples. There is
        also Fe-54 at 5.8%, Fe-57 at 2.2% and Fe-58 at .28%. If a proton
        of Fe-56 is pushed to become a neutron the result is Mn-56
        (Manganese with 25 protons and 31 neutrons). Mn-56 is
        radioactive and has a half-life of about 2.5 hours. Thus, an
        "RP" would be rendered into a radioactive (hazardous) material.
        This isotope may be the undesired "by-product" Marcus refers to
        in the interview. </p>
      <p>Hollingshead's method of producing his effect through the
        spinning of electromagnetic fields appears to not follow the
        work of researchers Ning Li and Eugene Podkletnov who also
        reported propulsive effects, though by the spinning of
        superconducting magnets. However, recent ESA-sponsored research
        by Tajmar, et al (see External links) has produced
        gravitomagnetic effects through the spinning of superconducting
        magnets composed of either nobium or lead (dissimmilar to Li and
        Podkletnov's apparatus) and the artificial gravity field
        produced was reversible when spin was reversed, similar to
        Hollingshead's reversible effects. </p>
      <p>Tajmar's experimental results have recently been tied to
        Burkhard Heim's Heim Theory of six elemental forces of nature by
        Walter Dröscher and Jochem Häuser. In Heim's theory
        gravito-photons, as of yet unobserved particles, would
        theoretically allow the conversion of an electromagnetic field
        into a gravitational-like field. Gravito-photons come in at
        least two types: one exhibiting repulsive gravitational effects
        and the other attractive gravitational effects. </p>
      <p><i>Trustiworthiness Questioned</i> </p>
      <p>A number of incidents have allegedly taken place that cast
        further doubt on Hollingshead's claims. Paul Horwood (moderator
        of Antigravity_open-source group), one of the original few to
        discuss the invention with Marcus on the BBC boards and to
        create their own Yahoo group, says: "On all the times I saw him,
        I did not see the device (and I saw him 3 times and spoke to him
        on those occasions). The only time that looked promising, I went
        to Marcus's house and waited outside for him all day (8 hours in
        all!) and he did not turn up, or return home." </p>
      <p>There was to have been a demonstration in early 2003 at
        Chepstow racecourse, a large building for internal practice of
        horse jumping. But the demo was cancelled at the last minute as
        many uninvited "guests" turned up with cameras. Writer Nick Cook
        of Jane's Defence Weekly (JDW) indicated that he'd dropped by
        unannouced to get some footage after Marcus had cancelled his
        first public demonstration (to which Cook had been invited).
        Cook reported that Marcus relayed a story about "the government
        confiscating his work" and turned Cook away at the door. </p>
      <p>Later that Spring demonstration versions of the device were to
        have been sent to test areas in Europe and North America. Photos
        of the device were also to have been sent, but neither devices
        nor photos were received. </p>
      <p>On several occasions, Marcus claimed that it was a hoax.
        However, he later recanted both that it was a hoax and that the
        government had confiscated his work, saying that he did it to
        avoid the intense scrutiny he was receiving (which included
        receiving several thousand emails a day, according to Tim
        Ventura of American Antigravity). </p>
      <p>According to Paul Horwood, Hollingshead now claims he has a
        number of engineers working on the device at Thornbury just
        outside Bristol, Somerset under a contract with the European
        Space Agency (ESA) to produce propulsion and that he has over 50
        million pounds in investment. This area, including Filton, is
        heavily invested in the aerospace industry, including BAE
        Systems. </p>

      <p>Tim Ventura writes (greenglow yahoo group): Dear All: </p>
      <p>I've just completed a 1/2 hour audio interview with Marcus
        Hollingshead -- the inventor of the controversial "Marcus
        Device". It was a brief, off-the-cuff overview of his remarkable
        technology, and I hope to follow up with a more in-depth
        interview in the near future. I'm busy collecting questions for
        the follow-up, which I hope will be as informative as the first.

      <center><b>The Marcus Device Controversy</b>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Tim Ventura</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This overview of the Marcus device began as an email response
        to a request for information on the Marcus device -- a device
        created by inventor Marcus Hollingshead that encountered more
        than its share of publicity and controversy between November
        2002 and march 2003, before Hollingshead went silent and
        withdrew from public scrutiny. </p>
      <p>The problem with Marcus has been that he was pressured by way
        too many people, way too fast to produce results. I started
        talking to him in November, and he's always sounded like an
        honest, rational man with a good heart. The problem is that once
        people started to hear his private claims that he could lift
        something like 2 tons of weight, things kind of went south. </p>
      <p>It's not really anything that one person in particular did --
        at least not from what I gather. I talked to him on the phone
        several times, and found the man to be intelligent, well-spoken,
        and generally altruistic. The problem arose when his daily email
        jumped to several thousand pieces per day. </p>
      <p>Also, while people in general have been very well-meaning, they
        are desperate to solve many of our current energy-problems, and
        when Marcus appeared with a potential solution it kind of got <br>
        out of control. Pretty soon film crews were showing up at his
        house unannounced, and he was getting unwanted phone calls from
        people who'd looked up his number online. While he seemed <br>
        to enjoy conversations with the people in his working group
        online, having lots of unknown persons call wanting proof about
        what his device might do can be a scary proposition at best,
        People in the Antigravity group started getting itchy because
        he'd promised proof but hadn't delivered, and it degenerated
        from honest speculation in early January 03 to outright
        name-calling in late February. </p>
      <p>In my opinion, its really a problem of a "social dynamic" at
        work here -- too many people, with too much access, all at once.
        This also correlates to the type of person that different people
        are. <br>
        For instance, I am a very open person, and I really don't value
        my privacy a heck of a lot -- therefore, when TV crews drop by
        with 5 minutes notice (and they have), I tend to just let them
        in for a demo. However, Marcus, who is much more of a private
        person, seems to have become a bit overwhelmed at this
        proposition. </p>
      <p>Also, keep in mind that I had initiated working with the media
        because I felt that it was time for the excellent work in the
        Lifters groups to see the light of day. There was some debate
        about <br>
        this, but the Lifters group as a whole has greatly benefited
        from being about to tell people about this new technology. </p>
      <p>Marcus hadn't actually "gone public" about his work. He had
        leaked information about his research to a few people, and from
        there it was leaked to several others, who in turn told their <br>
        friends about it. Kinda like a chain-letter, except that in this
        case there was a real person on the end of it that was affected
        by all of the publicity. </p>
      <p>His inbox overnight went from 10 to 1000 email messages -- he
        had to take on a second email address just to remain in contact
        with the people that he usually talked to from before the
        publicity. Unlike the Lifter technology, which has hundreds of
        people that can talk about how it&nbsp; works and where it came
        from, Marcus technology was represented solely by himself. That
        means that everything surrounding his device came back
        ultimately to him alone. Without any real group ownership of the
        expertise behind the device As I said before, Marcus was new to
        the publicity, and didn't have time to prepare the resources
        that the rest of us have had to answer questions, provide demo
        materials, etc. Naudin and Saviour have a masterful manner with
        regard to teaching people about Lifter technology, but they've
        had years to prepare this information and perfect a method of
        presenting it to people. Most of us in the AG groups tend to
        proselytize for the technologies that we believe in. I know that
        I do, and if you haunt the newsgroups much you'll notice that
        everybody there believes in something and can go on for months
        non-stop telling the world about it (again, I do this). </p>
      <p>Marcus, however, doesn't really have this personality -- he's
        more of a "take it or leave it" type of person. For me, this was
        another indicator that he was the "real deal". You have to
        understand that I have never seen working prototype pictures of
        the Marcus device, and all that I had to go on was the feeling
        that I got from interacting with him on the phone and online.
        The fact that he didn't try to "sell me" on the idea was a big
        plus. He told me about the device, and his story was always
        consistent. The other people that he talked to also had a
        consistent story -- I haven't talked to anybody and heard a
        different version than I heard from Marcus himself. That's a big
        plus from the credibility perspective. </p>
      <p>Again, its the social dynamic here that soured Marcus to
        things. For instance, Nick Cook indicated that he'd dropped by
        unannouced to get some footage with Bruce Goodison after Marcus
        had cancelled his first public demonstration. Cook had been
        looking for evidence like the rest of us had that Marcus had
        something real, and not just a "vaporware" claim about a new
        technology that might not have even existed. Marcus fabricated a
        cheap story about "the government confiscating his work" and
        turned Cook away at the door, which is the point at which Nick
        became soured to the idea himself. I talked to Marcus about this
        much later on, and he indicated that he'd just made up a story
        on the spot to get Nick to leave. It had nothing to do with
        either Nick or Bruce Goodison -- they're both excellent
        journalists with lots of experience, integrity, and a desire to
        help the world by spreading news about new technologies. The
        problem is that at the time when they'd dropped by, Marcus was
        getting tons of unsolicited email (much of it literally
        demanding a demonstration) as well as unsolicited phone calls
        from people he'd never even talked to instantly asking him for
        both video footage as well as a demonstration of the device in
        public. Marcus initial goal (from when I started talking to him
        in November) was to gradually ease into working with the public
        to tell them about the technologies he was working on.
        Unfortunately, I probably aggravated the issue a great deal,
        because his early descriptions of the technology might have gone
        unnoticed if it hadn't been for some of the things he'd
        mentioned about his research. </p>
      <p>When I read Marcus' firsts posts on the device, my very first
        thought about his claims was that they were bogus. Judging from
        the reaction of the Antigravity newsgroup, I gathered that a few
        other people also had that same initial reaction. The reason
        might be a little selfish -- after you hear claims but don't see
        results for a long enough period of time, you tend to protect
        yourself emotionally by becoming skeptical to the idea that
        somebody can be lifting hundreds of pounds of weight using a
        completely new and revolutionary technology. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, something that Marcus had said resonated with me.
        I remember that he was talking about his results being based on
        a study of the Earth's fields, which is something that I'd read
        about myself during the college years. Telsa had done a lot of
        work involving the Earth's electrical and magnetic-fields, and
        I'd always felt that this research might come in handy later as
        a potential basis for Antigravity research. However, I didn't
        have any specific ideas, and began asking Marcus questions
        offline to find out more about his research. So in terms of
        helping to make things more public I have some guilt about
        helping things get out of control for the poor fellow, because
        instead of being able to ask small questions in public without
        much public knowledge about what he was doing or how he was
        doing it, all of a sudden I was putting pieces together online,
        which tended to bring him into more of a public focus. All of
        the little questions that he'd asked innocently enough to
        different people in the newsgroups now came into some type of
        focus in mid-December as indicators that he was working on a new
        and radically different technology. </p>
      <p>In reality, I'm nobody special, so I think that perhaps this
        would have happened in any event no matter what my reaction
        would have been. Certainly I'm not the only person that took an
        early interest in his work, and from what I learned later he'd
        already been a little bit too honest in the BBC online newsgroup
        before he ever became involved with the Antigravity newsgroups.
        From January to mid-February Marcus became like somewhat of an
        addiction in the newsgroups. This was a strange phenomenon to
        watch, but if he didn't answer questions in the newsgroups for
        even a day people started asking whether he'd been kidnapped or
        the government had assassinated him. </p>
      <p>You have to understand that most inventors tend to segregate
        their time into "public" and "private". I do, Naudin does, heck
        -- pretty much everybody does this. When you talk to the public
        about what you've built, you really get into it -- but when you
        are actually working on it, you tend to hole up in the garage
        and put the entire world on "ignore" until you've finished with
        whatever it is that you're doing. <br>
        It's not uncommon for me to take an entire week and hole up in
        the garage without talking to anybody. It can be very rewarding
        to emerge later with a completed project, and usually I have a
        few hundred photos that I can post online to answer questions.
        Naudin is even worse -- he'll go a few weeks without really
        talking to anybody, but in his case he'll emerge from his lab
        with a 15-page spread detailing a completely new technology.
        It's because without the ability to focus and concentrate you're
        pretty much stuck on being able to develop a new idea. </p>
      <p>In the case of Marcus, his research time went from "whenever he
        wanted to work on it" to "highly-measured". Imagine having to
        tell people when you want to take a couple of days to work with
        something he claimed he'd been working on at leisure for 7+
        years. Suddenly it appears that his time isn't his own, and that
        if he doesn't make sure that everybody knows he'll be away from
        the computer the entire online community is going to start
        having panic attacks that he was snatched by 'The Men in Black'.
        I know that it sounds like I am playing up the publicity aspect
        of Marcus research, but I'm really not. Nobody, and I mean
        NOBODY, had any idea how big it would get, and how fast. I
        typically get about 40 to 50 emails per day. A lot of those are
        spam from people who get my email address online and want to
        sell me HgH or Viagra (?), and I typically delete those
        immediately. The rest are honest questions from persons like
        yourself that I can answer easily and in a straightforward
        manner. Last year I went on the Art Bell radio show and Wired
        Magazine Online did a feature about Lifter technology within a
        1-month period of time. Even at that point I was only getting
        maybe about 300 emails per day -- and most of them were easy to
        answer, because I'd already written a detailed article that
        explained a lot about how the technology worked. The people that
        I couldn't help went to Naudin's site, and many more went to the
        Lifters online community with its (back then) 700+ members. We
        were sitting pretty on the media front -- we had the ability to
        handle the amount of attention that we were getting, and we were
        able to tell a lot of people about the new technologies as a
        result. </p>
      <p>Marcus literally blew us all away. I KNOW that he wasn't lying
        about the volume of email that he was getting, because his email
        box would fill up to "over mailbox limit" about halfway through
        each passing day. This is within a 1-month period of time that
        it did this. Marcus really started to get publicity in late
        November 2002, and it built up over a few week period of time.
        By mid-December, he had a healthy following in the Antigravity
        newsgroup and people in the 5 or 10 other AG newsgroups were
        develping more than just a passing interest. Great stuff for
        Marcus -- he'd thought that he was the only person doing this
        research, and it turned out that lots of people shared this
        common interest with him. We had lots of really valuable and
        productive exchanges. </p>
      <p>Marcus bided his time working on the projects -- he'd initially
        stated that he could lift around 200 pounds of weight with his
        November version (prototype #161, if I remember correctly). He
        didn't have a digital camera, and he didn't want to publish
        photos until he had a better prototype anyways. That was OK with
        me -- I'm used to working with a variety of inventors and came
        to realize a long time ago that everybody has their own style. I
        was content to wait until Marcus had additional data, and the
        only thing that I insisted upon was that sooner or later he
        ante-up and provide some photographic evidence. </p>
      <p>Despite lacking photos or video evidence, Marcus did have
        documentation. In fact, he wrote more documentation about his
        device than I'd ever hoped to receive. He cranked out about the
        equivalent of 30-pages of "real" documentation in a very
        detailed form within 1-month, and had the email equivalent of
        many more pages in postings about how the device worked online.
        The compilation that I sent you earlier contains what Jerry
        Montgomery was able to put together from Marcus postings, and
        that's based solely on newsgroup correspondence taking place
        within a 1-month period of time. At that point Marcus had
        already been publishing details online for about 2.5 months. </p>
      <p>Despite the incredible amount of published data that Marcus was
        able to complete, in some ways it made things worse for him than
        not having anything at all. The reason was the nature of his
        research. My work, currently focused on Lifters, was in a
        technology that's easy to explain -- the device is built like
        this, it works like that, and it can be described in a manner
        similar to some other thing ....basic, easy to explain, and easy
        to compare. </p>
      <p>After all, Lifters have been accused by science of being
        ion-wind devices. If nothing else, rebutting this claim gives us
        someplace to start -- something to compare against to provide
        people with an idea about how the device works. Additionally, we
        had TONS of video and photographic evidence to back up our
        claims. We had so much data that the entire group was running
        out of places to store it online. On the CD-Rom's that I sell on
        the AAG site, I now have </p>
      <p>300+ megs of data -- much of it being photographic and video
        evidence regarding how the Lifters work. That 300 megs is mostly
        just my own research -- Naudin probably has a stack of CD's as
        tall as a book-case containing the work from his website... </p>
      <p>In Marcus case, the documentation that he provided made things
        worse because his technology is so utterly different. It's not
        ion-wind, nor the Biefeld-Brown effect, nor apparently the
        Searle effect. In fact, the more than you tried to pin down
        exactly what it was, the harder it became to describe it. </p>
      <p>Also, its not like he could simply fall back onto describing
        the construction of the device -- reason being that it contained
        a series of interrelated coils with a unique configuration that
        were intrinsically tied to the operation of the device. Every
        time he wrote a detailed summary of the construction of the
        device, we'd come away with more questions than we'd started out
        with. After a time I gave up trying to understand how it was
        constructed, because I only had bits and pieces. </p>
      <p>Marcus was using an arrangement of 6-coils, and what are
        described as "bifilar windings". Essentially, this means that
        you wind two wires together around a coil and then tie one of
        the ends to together, making the two wires essentially one long
        wire wound "against itself" down the length of the armature its
        on. There are 6 of these armatures on the device, mounted around
        a central RP (or reference point). </p>
      <p>Marcus created all of the terminology for these parts -- this
        lends additional credibility to the idea that he'd had 7 years
        of experience with it. These are ideas that you just don't "make
        up" for publicity. For instance, the bifilar windings on the
        armature-coils are self-cancelling fields, and even a
        basic-electronics education will tell you that. However, the
        interesting thing is that once you really start to get into the
        advanced "post-scientific" research on magnetic fields you start
        to see self-cancelling magnetic coils all over the place. The
        reason is apparently that while the "B-field" of the coils
        cancel, the "A-field" that Tom Bearden keeps talking about
        doesn't -- which means that you can isolate the really
        interesting effects from the coil without having to deal with
        the high field-intensity effects from normal electromagnetism. </p>
      <p>Marcus had described these six armatures as being activated in
        a series, or order, to obtain results. Each of the coils was
        spun by an electric motor mounted on the armature, and when the
        coil was spun up to a certain speed and "stubs" mounted a
        periodic intervals on the side of the armature were fired in
        sequence the antigravity effect was created. </p>
      <p>Marcus Antigravity effect was a directional force that was
        applied in a unique manner depending on which coils were
        activated. This means that by activating (for instance) coils 1
        and 3, he could create an antigravity effect AND move the device
        left -- or something to that effect. Turning on and off each set
        of coils gave him movement on one axis of thrust, which
        corresponded to X, Y, or Z in a standard 3-D geometric graph.
        Since you can move in either direction down any given axis of
        thrust, this means that you have 6 axis of movement height (up
        and down), width (left or right), and depth (forward or
        backward). His device provided movement on any axis by either
        one coil or an arrangement of coils. </p>
      <p>For a while Marcus didn't want to talk about side effects, but
        I pressured him into it. The reason was that I have seen
        side-effects that were pretty darned strange in a number of
        different experiments, and I was willing to bet that if I
        pressured him a bit he'd talk about what he'd seen but didn't
        want to reveal (for fear that people wouldn't take him
        seriously). It turns out that I was right..... </p>
      <p>Marcus had talked about the RP, or "Reference Point" upon
        several occassions. This is a multi-layered device that acts
        somewhat like a capactive element. It sits in the direct center
        of the Marcus device, and it IS the reference-point for the
        entire device. The RP is manufactured from cast-iron, and Marcus
        says that he has a local company build them for a few bucks each
        by pouring iron into a mold based on one of his designs. </p>
      <p>You can active the RP at the same time that you activate the
        coils. You have coils rotating around the RP, with "stubs" on
        the coils firing periodically at points corresponding to spots
        on the surface of the RP. Meanwhile, you also have an electrical
        charge on the RP itself, which means that there are a lot of
        elements interacting at once to create a very complex dynamic.
        One of the interesting side effects was a darkening and
        "blurring" effect of the RP, as if light was being reflected off
        it. Another was a Star-Trek like "force shield" around the RP.
        These ONLY occurred when ALL of the coils were activated at
        once. Also note that since the coils are opposing in nature (one
        for each direction on each axis), that when you are creating the
        force field effect the device cannot be levitating. However, the
        device is operational, and you have a force-field that you can
        apparently bounce a heavy hammer off of without being able to
        penetrate it (Marcus description). </p>
      <p>Another interesting note is that the force-field effect can be
        modified to create a vacuum. I'm not sure how Marcus noticed
        this, but he'd said that it appeared to create a vacuum inside
        of the field's boundaries during operation. Interestingly, it
        also ran VERY cold -- apparently down to a hundred degrees below
        zero, but only within the localized boundaries of the field. I
        am not a professional physicist, but this is something that has
        been reported with the Searl effect and several other
        experiments, and the reason that I believe it occurs is because
        you are taking the kinetic energy of the devicem as well as some
        of the kinetic energy of its molecules (ie: heat energy), and
        injecting it into another dimension. After all, anytime we
        directly modify a gravitational field we are creating a
        dimensional effect, but in normal life we don't notice it
        because the boundaries between gravitational fields are very
        gradual. </p>
      <p>Well, in the Marcus device the boundary between gravitational
        fields is not a several thousand mile-long gradient like the
        Earth's field is -- instead of you have a gradient perhaps
        10-times more intense focused within a 3 to 4 inch area. That
        means that you area creating essentially a rift in time and
        space (self-healing) that is kept open by the energy that you're
        pumping into the device. </p>
      <p>To the best of my knowledge, this is the most accurate
        description that I have seen yet for why his device does this.
        Marcus himelf couldn't explain why these effects occurred, and
        to be honest I scared him more than a little when I told him my
        theory. </p>
      <p>In the hypothesis that I just put forth on the origin and
        functionality of the Marcus device effect, the interesting this
        is that there really isn't a direct correlation between input
        energy and the effect itself. That's because you aren't using
        the input energy to actually cause an effect -- you are
        essentially using the input energy to translate the device into
        another dimension ( although it is still partially within ours).
      </p>
      <p>Einstein called these "frames of reference". The idea is that
        the energy input is used only in putting the device into another
        frame of reference, but that any interaction between us and our
        "normal" frame would have to be modified for any interactions
        with the "modified" frame. </p>
      <p>Again, this takes place in normal physics -- but usually it
        involves motion, and normally it takes place over a vastly
        larger gradient of time/space/whatever. The difference between
        two frames is the difference between two locomotives moving at
        different speeds -- the energy input goes into accelerating each
        locomotive up to that speed, but the actual work performed if
        those two trains interact is solely a product of the frame of
        inertial reference (mass &amp; velocity = energy). </p>
      <p>Another excellent example is a helium-balloon. You put the
        energy into condensing the helium and pumping it into the
        balloon, but it's not the helium that creates lift --it's the
        surrounding atmosphere. In a very real sense a helium balloon
        gets its energy from the surrounding environment. The energy
        that you put into "maintaining flight" in a helium balloon is
        only the strain on the fabric used in holding the helium into
        the confines of the bag that encloses it. With the Marcus
        device, I'd bet money that its not the input energy creating
        these effects -- it's instead the difference in frames of
        dimensional/inertial reference between "our" environment and the
        "device's" environment, whatever that difference may be. </p>
      <p>You see, even though this sounds like a load of BS, magnetism
        isn't real. This isn't an idea that I'm making up -- in fact,
        it's an entire chapter in the physics 101 textbook kicking
        around downstairs in my house. Take two magnetic fields, and
        project them in the same direction at the same speed. Field A
        can't interact with Field B, because neither of the fields
        really exists -- they are merely ripples on a pond, and that
        pond is the background of the time-space continuum. </p>
      <p>People that believe in relativistic gravitational effects take
        for granted that things like this happen -- after all, gravity
        isn't a force per se in relativity -- only a modification of the
        dimensions of time-space. Well, most people don't realize that
        Einstein based his theory of gravitational force on his study of
        magnetism. Magnetism is the same thing -- its a modification of
        the fabric of time-space. </p>
      <p>Take the two magnetic fields that didn't interact from a moment
        ago, and now change the direction that one of them is travelling
        in. Suddenly, the two fields that coudn't even see each other a
        moment ago now create an incredible "torque" - this is the same
        thing that we see in bar-magnets and electric motors. This is
        the "torsion field" research that Russia spent millions of
        dollars on in the cold-war, because they understood that
        magnetism is the MOST misunderstood force in the Universe. </p>
      <p>Bar magnets are different than pure fields because they are
        composed of the discrete fields of thousands of tiny magnetic
        "domains". That's why the fields from bar-magnets are never
        "invisible" to each other -- its because that the fields in bar
        magnets are too jumbled to ever really "line up" to the point of
        being invisible. Pure fields can do this, however, reinforcing
        the supremacy of Einstein's relativistic effects with relation
        to electromagnetism. </p>
      <p>Anyhow, that's about it for now -- I will try to come up with a
        more detailed picture for you on this if you like, but I expect
        that you will probably have more questions about Marcus theory
        and device in near future. It's a very complex idea underlying
        his research, but the basis of it is the idea of "rotating
        magnetic fields". </p>
      <p>If you want to do additional research on your own into related
        fields of study, I would definitely look up "relativity and
        magnetism" -- it provides an excellent example of how to
        visualize relativity theory in the study of magnetic field
        interactions. This is something that electronics engineers
        aren't taught, which is why you've never heard of this in an
        engineering sense before. However, in physics is a well-known
        concept, although most physicists prefer to work with quantum
        mechanics rather than relativity these days. </p>
      <p>In terms of rotating magnetic fields, you can look up "torsion
        fields" - again, the Russians have the best understanding of
        advanced torsion field physics, although their best material
        probably hasn't been translated yet. Additionally, rotating
        magnetic fieds are the basis for the Searle Effect and the Hamel
        device. </p>
      <p>Marcus was intrigued by Searle's claims, because they appear to
        have matched many of his own results. Interestingly, Marcus had
        developed his work within an "intellectual vacuum" and had never
        heard of Searle before I told him about the similarities.
        Nevertheless, force-fields, ice-cold operating temperatures, and
        antigravity seem to be a pervasive similarity between all manner
        of experiments that have been reported using rotating magnetic
        fields. I'd assumed that Searle's claims were bunk, but after
        hearing about similar effects from Marcus' research its led to
        to reconsider some of the criticism surrounding Searle lately. </p>
      <p>One a final note -- one group that may lend additional
        credibility to this research is Godin and Roschin in Russia.
        They obviously benefit from the years of knowledge that the
        Russians accrued in magnetic field systems theory, and they
        attempted a replication of the Searle effect device some years
        back (and claimed to get some results). I hear that they have
        been working on a revised version of their experimental setup
        recently and hope to have even better results in the very near
        future. </p>
      <p>Kinda makes you wonder, huh? </p>

      <p>Hi Group, (Andrew, Colin, Jaro, Jean, Jerry, Michael, and Tim)
      </p>
      <p>To answer Andrews questions - (by the way this stuff is in the
        pack as well). The dimensions are variable - according to the
        version involved. Put simply -- What is isn't - It isn't a
        levitator based on the ‘Townsend’ or ‘Biefield-Brown’
        principles, nor a ‘Searle’ engine, nor is it based on
        superconductors, very high voltages or very large spinning
        masses. </p>
      <p>161 is comprised of 7 charged components, 2 drive mechanisms -
        one primary one backup - and that’’s it. 6 of the charged
        devices are coils - the other is a sphere comprising a number of
        layers some metallic some dielectric. </p>
      <p>161 is a 500mm cube, 162 a 700mm cube and 163 a 42mm cube. </p>
      <p>161 is rated up to 6.75Kw, 162 to 15.3Kw and 163 to 500W(0.5Kw)
        161 is tested to lift over 5200Kg to date 161 is tested to
        accelerate at over 60m/s^2 Some elements are made for me by
        engineering prototyping firms. </p>
      <p><i>Description</i> </p>
      <p>Toroid --&nbsp; The coils can be thought of as rings
        (simplistic view), more a sort of modified toroidal coil. If you
        imagine the core is a ring of mild steel with a bifilar winding
        then you are close. One winding is pulsed +ve/-ve the other
        -ve/+ve offset by 90 degrees. If you imagined the toroid had a
        central hub (it doesn't) much as a car wheel then the toroid
        ring spins around its virtual hub at a speed of approx 4,200
        rpm. The coils are mounted in individually fixed drive units on
        the outer edge of the device. The drives house the power take
        off brushes and drive cogs that spin the toroid in place. </p>
      <p>All six coils are 'linked' much as the two links of a chain,
        but all six are linked together and not in series.
        Asymmetrically placed for each coil is the charged fixed device
        termed the ‘rp’. All six coils are free to rotate without
        impacting each other and each pass very close to one side of the
        ‘rp’. </p>
      <p>No one coil can be made separately and then added. The cores
        are first linked and precision welded then heated to yellow heat
        for an hour, annealed and cooled, then the inner stubs are
        attached with an insulating spacer. The stubs are wound and then
        each of the coils is wound. The coils are then balanced (for
        weight) </p>
      <p>Each coil is held at the furthest point away from the rp in an
        adjustable drive capable of spinning them up to 5000rpm
        (4,200rpm is sufficient). The drive is mounted and connected to
        each of the coils from an external cuboid frame which is also
        used to mount the centrally charged device (rp - reference
        point). Adjustment is made so that the coils do not interfere
        with each other and run as close as is possible to the rp. The
        coils spin around a virtual hub -- in plane -- much as a bicycle
        wheel would do if the back of a bicycle is held up and the wheel
        is spun. But of course the hub is virtual. </p>
      <p>The coils are adjusted so that they pass very close on one side
        of the rp. (loop position rp) </p>
      <p><i>Stubs</i> </p>
      <p>Within the inner circumference are 12 small insulated coils
        perpendicular to the toroid which are appositionally pulsed --
        depending on their spin position relative to the ‘rp’.(diagram
        loop 4stub shows just 4 of the 12 stubs) </p>
      <p>The first versions that produced MAJOR effects were all 6 coils
        intertwined. (reason is position re rp) I am sure there are
        other configurations however. Each pair of coils is set in
        either x/y/or z plane but each pair are obviously slightly out
        of plane to provide clearance. +ve rotate clockwise -ve
        anticlockwise. Push follows left-hand rule, Pull follows Right
        hand rule (rp polarity reversed) ‘Rp’. Rp is physically at the
        center can be a sphere or pointed shape </p>
      <p><i>Materials</i> </p>
      <p>Toroid --&nbsp; purified Iron. (the latest versions anyway as
        I've had them cast molded)(variants include steel welded) [3%
        silicon iron (note this is the same as transformer steel] </p>
      <p>Stubs -- purified Iron (Variants Aluminum)&nbsp; ‘RP’ </p>
      <p>Core -- Purified Iron Core (variants steel, aluminium, copper,
        gold plated copper) </p>
      <p>Dielectric -- Kapton (variants - silicon rubber, ptfe, wafer
        ptfe, pe foam). Dielectric strengths from 1Kv to 12Kv/mm </p>
      <p>Shell -- Purified Iron sphere shell (sectional) (variants
        -aluminium, steel, gold plated carbon fibre, copper, gold plated
        copper) </p>
      <p>Windings -- Toroid: 15cm torus is 12awg 90 turns. 10/12 AWG
        bonded bifilar double wound helical 90degree offset. Windings
        are 30degree to edge, second winding begins one quarter diameter
        (90 degrees) after the commencement of the first. Each Bifilar
        winding is 90 degrees offset </p>
      <p>Think of a helix, with an out of plane pitch 30 degrees off
        perpendicular to plane, so as you commence with two wires,
        beside each other originally then one passes to the right, one
        to the left of the plane, and then back up and over again. The
        windings are 120 turns bifilar (helical) on 161 (12 AWG). The
        windings are 210 turns bifilar (helical) on 162 (10 AWG) </p>
      <p>Jaro </p>
      <p>"Windings are 30degree to edge, second winding begins one
        quarter diameter (90 degrees) after the commencement of the
        first." </p>
      <p>30 degrees probably means the section of the toroid ring
        between the snubs, but does the second winding refer to the
        second wire (bifilar means 2 wires), or does it refer to winding
        on the next 30 degrees of the toroid ring? Or do you wind one
        winding first, and then on top of it a second winding, as
        opposed to winding the two wires at the same time, next to each
        other? </p>
      <p>Oh, I think I'm beginning to get it. You wind one winding
        first, and then start the second one quarter diameter of the
        toroid ring further, but I'm still unsure about the 30 degrees
        to the edge. And I assume that 90 turns means 90 turns of each
        of the 2 wires, not total. </p>
      <p>Hi -- sorry if it’s not clear. Simplest bifilar arrangement is
        to take TWO single strands (not bonded bifilar) and hold them so
        that when you commence winding around the torus you are winding
        TWO wires in parallel - so the simplest way of thinking of it is
        as winding a PAIR of wires not just one. In the ones sent there
        are actually 4 wires (2 pair of bonded bifilar) You'll notice
        one wire is green one red for each winding pair -- these are
        parallel connected - I have tried series connected as well. The
        TWO pairs of bonded bifilar are a counter-wound caduceus (think
        DNA) coil. These are series connected -- again I have tried
        parallel. </p>
      <p>30 degrees to edge isn't any too clear - I'm sorry - imagine
        you are looking down on the top of a torus so that it looks just
        like a rectangular section. If you commence winding so that the
        wire is being wound (approx.) + 30 degrees from perpendicular to
        the long axis (or the plane of the torus) then you've got it. </p>
      <p>Sorry - meant to say that for the helically wound the cross
        overs are top and bottom -- so there are precisely STRAIGHT
        lines of bumps - on the upper and lower median of the <br>
        torus. Sort of like a spine. </p>
      <p>Windings -- 34Awg 10strand Litz heavy pol. Turns 8 (variants 4,
        12, 16) </p>
      <p>Toroid --&nbsp; Toroid is a circular flattened ring (variants
        from 15cm up to 50cm in diameter) Six coils intertwined. Two
        coils make up the -x/+x -- think of them as left and right. Two
        coils make up the -z/+z -- think of them as near and far. Two
        coils make up the -y/+y -- think of them as up and down. Weight
        of each coil is about 0.7 Kg or 1.5 lbs. x sectional ratio is,
        width = 1.5* depth (15cm torus 18mm*12mm) </p>
      <p>Stubs --&nbsp; Stubs are flat pyramid bullet nosed cylinders.
        Height 8mm (variants 6mm) Diameter for use on 15cm Torus =12mm
        (variants 10mm 8mm and flat topped). Stubs are arranged on the
        inner circumference of each torus perpendicular to the plane of
        the torus. There are 12 stubs on each torus. They are arranged
        30degrees separation. The stubs are insulated from the main
        torus by a 0.5mm insulator disc. </p>
      <p>‘Rp’-- Rp is physically 18mm in diameter (variants 16mm, 20mm
        10mm+, 12 section 16mm)(8Kv/mm variant 18mm) parabolic section
        18mm, point (variant spherical base 12mm -- virtual sphere 18mm)
      </p>
      <p>Core -- diameter is always at least 5mm less than overall
        spherical (parabolic concave 7mm less) </p>
      <p>Dielectric -- varies 1mm to 1.5mm (point variant 2mm -.5mm at
        point) </p>
      <p>Shell --&nbsp; 1.5mm thick. </p>
      <p>Mounting -- Toroids Each Torus is clamped within a 4 wheeled
        curved drive - the drives can be powered individually or in
        groups of three. The drives clamp the torus at the furthest
        point from the ‘rp’. The torus's are always driven (for lift and
        motion) +ve clockwise, -ve anticlockwise. </p>
      <p>Studs --&nbsp; Stubs are point powered in pairs at the point
        where two stubs exactly bracket the ‘rp’ at their closest point.
      </p>
      <p>‘Rp’ -- ‘Rp’ is held by six insulated arms woven through the
        torus sets. </p>
      <p>Drives --&nbsp; Toroids Torus drives are tooth belt and geared
        drives (2 motors 165) producing maximum rotational speed of
        torus of 4500rpm - (4220 is sufficient for reliable results)
        Torus is housed and clamped in position by the drive unit which
        is adjustable. The drive unit provide power t.o.'s for the stubs
        and torus coil. For each pair one MUST rotate clockwise, its
        partner counter clockwise. </p>
      <p>Stubs ...&nbsp; So one power take off is for the stubs </p>
      <p>Power ---&nbsp; Elements Voltage applied to all components 210V
        AC Freq 420Hz (variations 220V, 240V, Freq 60Hz, 120Hz, 240Hz
        330Hz) All produce similar (although variably efficient)
        results.&nbsp; Therefore 8 circuits required. Any standard power
        controls/meters for each Capable of handling the power
        requirements are suitable. 15cm (165 variant) has a maximum
        tested power of 3.8Kva (1.7Metric Tonne lift) Toroids All torus
        coils are powered independently Toroidal inductance depends on
        dimensions and material used 165 (15cm) 90 turns. 161 is wound
        120 turns, 162 wound 200 turns. </p>
      <p>Stubs --&nbsp; All stubs are powered exactly the same and at
        the same power (motion variant only). The drive unit provide
        power t.o.'s for the stubs and torus coil. Stubs are powered in
        steps but all powered equally. Each stub is fired twice per
        revolution. Power to stubs is never (for motion) more than one
        half balance on 15 cm torus sets balance power is 0.58Kva power
        to stubs is therefore 0.29 Kva (210V). (161 balance = 0.72Kva) </p>
      <p>‘Rp’ -- All torus coils are powered independently as is the rp.
        Electrical connections are by means of the arms. Polarity can be
        reversed on the ‘rp’. Charged negatively antigravity, positively
        stronger gravity </p>
      <p><i>Actions</i> </p>
      <p>1. Lift and drive capability </p>
      <p>2. Rapid temperature reduction around the rp -- Approx
        100Kelvin when in motion. </p>
      <p>3. Loss of reflected light from the rp. Increasing amounts of
        power (in balance -- i.e., no movement) leads to a gradual
        darkening around the rp -- eventually to the point where the rp
        is <br>
        no longer distinguishable. </p>
      <p>4. Inertia less movement -- instant change of direction for the
        device and anything contained directly in the field -- not true
        for carried objects that are too large to be so contained. </p>
      <p>5. Fixed device (prevented from moving) is capable of exerting
        a force on unattached objects - pushing them away. </p>
      <p>6. Field is capable of being broadened and weakened or narrowed
        and amplified - termed gravitational lensing. </p>
      <p>7. The field is capable of producing an air tight 2.2m diameter
        spherical vacuum. Maximum lift achieved 5220Kg - power required
        6.2Kva (vs 161) Maximum Accn (nonload) 61.2m/ssqd (vs 161) </p>
      <p>There is quite a bit more but that covers most things. </p>
      <p>Spherical field effect is a production of a standard spherical
        rp but with all stubs powered and toroids powered beforehand -
        toroids and ‘rp’ are then spun and powered in phase to produce
        shield field. </p>
      <p>Pull is reverse polarity on ‘rp’ and right hand rule(not left
        hand rule ) for spin on toroids. </p>
      <p>The device acts to produce a regular gravitational field - the
        field strength is increased until there is equivalence with
        earths gravitational influence. Power beyond that is 'lensed' to
        produce movement the lensing is caused by increasing power above
        G threshold in one or more of the coils (providing they are not
        opposites). </p>
      <p>Is that sufficient for now Andrew? - if I've missed any let me
        know what you need. </p>
      <p>Marcus </p>
      <p><b>Anomalous Effects</b> </p>
      <p>1. If power is increased to all coils and rp in equal amounts,
        the device does not move, BUT the area surrounding the rp
        becomes darker and darker, until at high power loads the rp is
        no longer discernible. If the lighting levels are low it is
        possible to make out a shell coronal effect (purple/violet), a
        sort of hollow ball of plasma surrounding the rp but spaced out
        from it a few cm's. At very high balanced power the corona
        appears 'pinched' in towards the rp in the interstices of the
        coils. This affects radio and other e-m wave forms directed
        through the rp. Not seen when the device is moving at all. </p>
      <p>2. When moving or producing an effect like the laser-lensed
        field or spherical shield field, the temperature of the rp drops
        suddenly to approx 100K (-173C). The only tests I have on this
        are for 161 and the original rp only showed a lesser drop until
        the rp was improved constructionally. This might get even lower
        as the device is improved. </p>
      <p>3. Turns are immediate, if you take the device up and produce a
        +X vector, then switch immediately to a +z vector the turn is
        immediate. Carrying a large load this is not true. It appears
        anything small enough to be held within the field can be
        inertially compensated for. It does not 'turn' like a car, but
        just processes sideways, instead of forwards. </p>
      <p>4. A two chambered vessel held within the field, one chamber
        holding liquid, divided from the other chamber with no liquid
        shows that anything carried within the field effect also is
        subject to inertialess turns. </p>
      <p>5. The spherical field produces a perfect vaccuum as it is
        powered up and formed. It also forms a barrier that can be
        physically felt and hit. </p>
      <p>6. The beamed field effect can be used to knock things over or
        knock a hole through thin sheet copper. </p>
      <p>7. Two devices can be used in close conjunction with each other
        with no obvious interference. </p>

      <p>Vacuum is a deliberate effect of a slowly increased spherical
        shield, not normally present in moving variants. </p>
      <p>… Just to correct: <br>
        The shield effect is a slowly expanded spherical field that is
        produced by an altered rp and slower increased power and spin
        changes. This is complete enough a field to form a vacuum and
        strong enough to be hit with a rubber mallet and chair. So sorry
        - not really an anomalous effect - just one we hadn't discussed.
        Since then I've refined the design to the point where 161's
        balance power is about 1.2Kva - with 162 I hope to have this
        down nearer 1Kva. </p>
      <p><b>University Testing</b> </p>
      <p>Current tests on 161 at Cambridge have shown a lift capacity of
        2040 Kilos for an overall input power of 4.152 Kva. Or approx
        5.6 Horsepower.&nbsp; Overall weight inclusive of 161 was 2162
        Kilos therefore overall gross efficiency was 520 Kilo/Kva approx
        470 Kilos/Hp. </p>

        <p><i><b>Gregory Daigle</b> examines Marcus Hollingshead's
            'gravity-lensing' device</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>Gravity research is hot. Today, a satellite circles far above
        the earth measuring the effects of Einstein's Theory of General
        Relativity. Using rotating spheres ten thousand times smoother
        than a billiard ball in a near-perfect vacuum, the Gravity Probe
        B experiment is gathering data to prove (or disprove) if
        speeding objects drag space-time with them in gravitational
        fields. </p>
      <p>In an adjacent area of research, several labs in Europe and the
        U.S. are vying to be the first to detect gravity waves. British
        oddsmakers Ladbrokes gives 6 to 1 odds that gravity waves will
        be detected by 2010 and several labs say it will happen even
        sooner. Other researchers are less interested in detecting
        gravity than in generating gravity. In other words --
        antigravity. </p>
      <p>As a youngster I read about "cavorite" the antigravity metal
        discovered by Mr. Cavor and which propelled a spacecraft in H.G.
        Wells' Edwardian science fiction novel "First Men in the Moon."
        Until now antigravity has existed only in the domain of cartoons
        and science fiction. But in November of 2002 one inventor made
        public that he had stumbled upon a method to produce and control
        gravity. Lots of gravity! If successful it would change nearly
        every aspect of society and how we perceive our place in a three
        dimensional world. </p>
      <p>Like Mr. Cavor, Marcus Hollingshead is a British inventor. But
        before we stereotype him, he is also an IT consultant and was
        trained as a biochemist. In November of 2002 he began posting
        the results of his 12+ years of "tinkering" with geomagnetic
        models of the Earth on the Yahoo Magnetic-Levitation online
        newsgroup (which is no longer active). What he reported to other
        newsgroup members seemed fantastic and more in the realm of
        science fiction. <br>

      <p>His posts described a series of experimental devices quaintly
        known as "Bob." An early Bob crushed his Black and Decker
        workmate table when it was switched on. Redesigns produced a Bob
        that produced a "darkening halo effect" around its center when
        its fast-rotating rings were powered in balance. When out of
        balance -- it levitated! </p>
      <p>At first Hollingshead assumed that the forces being manipulated
        were magnetic. But a professor from Cambridge acting as a
        reviewer for his patent attorney countered that it was, " ...
        motive power without apparent thrust ...", "A new form of
        propulsion...", "... characteristics appropriate to an
        anti-gravity device ...". Over a few months in late 2002 and
        early 2003 fellow experimenters coaxed the reticent Hollingshead
        to reveal increasingly detailed accounts of his construction and
        experiments with his most recent Bobs (now renamed versions 161
        and 162). And then -- silence. </p>
      <p>Since March of 2003 little mention of his ongoing work has made
        it to the newsgroups. Small wonder. At the peak of his postings
        he was inundated by thousands of emails a day. Over 100
        uninvited "guests" showed up at Chepstow racecourse in February
        2003 for a supposedly private demonstration of his technology to
        Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines, Nick Cook of Jane's
        Defense Weekly and others. This caused him to shun inquiries,
        falsely report that his device had been confiscated by the
        government and, alternately, that the whole thing was just a
        hoax. </p>
      <p>This despite his already having posted on newsgroups pages
        worth of descriptions and engineering specifications for his
        version 161, providing enough data for many enthusiasts to build
        their own computer models. And those computer models all seemed
        to fit together to form a complex-but-not-implausible design
        looking somewhat like a ringed Ptolemaic model of the solar
        system with an iron sphere at its center where the Earth would
        be. So were his claims real? </p>
      <p><b>American Antigravity</b> </p>
      <p>Tim Ventura, editor of the newsgroup American Antigravity,
        keeps track of online newsgroup topics such as "tensor fields,"
        "lifters" and other "electro-gravitic" oddities which are the
        focus of enthusiasts ranging from weekend hobbyists to certified
        engineers. His experience has given him a good sense of each
        claimant's level of credibility -- and many are lacking. </p>
      <p>You can often identify those with empty claims by their
        inconsistent facts or their requests for additional funding to
        pursue unspecified research. To be sure, not all those seeking
        support for research are scammers. Some are legitimate
        researchers in the physical sciences working with accredited
        universities. At least one researcher held enough sway to be
        contracted both through NASA (in their Breakthrough Propulsion
        Physics Project) and to ESA (the European Space Agency). </p>
      <p>In these past few years Ventura has had several communications
        with Marcus Hollingshead and conducted one of the most recent
        and in-depth interviews with him. Ventura gauges his consistency
        and credibility as high. "[He] always sounded like an honest,
        rational man with a good heart," said Ventura. Being neither a
        physicist nor having publicly solicited funding, Hollingshead
        was and still is an enigma. </p>
      <p>In one recorded interview (.WMA) Hollingshead described himself
        to Ventura as "a complete layman [in terms of physics]", and
        that when it comes to what's happening in the physics realm, "I
        really don't understand it." Apparently straight talk from an
        inventor who describes his discovery as "actually more of an
        accident." But what he lacks in formal training in the physical
        sciences, he compensates with quiet persistence and constant
        tinkering with his device. </p>

      <p>What makes the "Marcus Device" (not to be confused with the
        pulp novel by Ib Melchior) work? </p>
      <p><b>The Marcus Device</b> </p>
      <p>Along with the strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and
        electromagnetic force, gravity is one of the four fundamental
        forces in nature. Like electromagnetic force (light, radio
        waves, etc.) gravity gets weaker with the square of the
        distance. You move it twice as far away and its force is one
        quarter of what it had been. Move it four times as far and it
        diminishes to a sixteenth the force. But gravity initially
        starts off far, far weaker than the other forces. How much
        weaker? If electromagnetic force had a value equal to 1.0 you
        would have to move the decimal point 36 places to the left
        before you matched the weakness of gravity. It's a billion,
        billion, billion, billion times weaker! </p>
      <p>The force of gravity affects all matter with mass.
        Electromagnetic force affects just electrically charged
        particles. Imagine how dramatically everyday life has changed
        since the harnessing of magnetic fields in the late 1880s for
        industrial and domestic purposes. These range from multi-story
        dynamos for producing electricity, particle accelerators, vacuum
        pumps, huge electric motors to drive industry -- down to modest
        home appliances such as refrigerators, vacuum cleaners or
        clothes dryers. </p>

      <p>How the Marcus Device creates "gravity-lensing" (a term
        Hollingshead prefers to "antigravity") is not well established.
        The nature of gravity itself is not well known. Several theories
        are in play: string theory, loop quantum gravity -- but no
        proposed theory has suggested that such a device was within
        reach. </p>
      <p>Physically, the first generation of his devices that produced
        gravity-lensing fields consisted of six rotating flattened
        rings. The rings were arranged in offset pairs, each rotating
        counter to the other. One pair was oriented in the x-y plane,
        another pair oriented at 90 degrees to that plane (x-z) and the
        third pair in the y-z plane. None of the rings had hubs. They
        were all powered by a set of roller-clamps, not unlike the
        wheels on a roller coaster car. That left the center to be
        occupied by a spherical capacitor (called the "RP" -- for
        Reference Point) composed of layers of metal and non-conducting
        material. </p>
      <p>Recall that Hollingshead was originally trying to simulate the
        generation of magnetic fields in the earth's core. In emulating
        the circulation of local magnetic zones he studded the rings
        with pyramid-shaped stubs wound as electromagnets. All the rings
        were wound with criss-crossing wires to cancel any overall
        electromagnetic fields. Then he spun the rings at over 4,000
        RPMs, timing the stubs to fire at specific intervals and
        connected it all to a high voltage power source capable of
        various frequency outputs. Obviously this configuration was not
        only dangerous to operate but also not one a mere weekend
        hobbyist is likely to replicate. </p>
      <p>What's going on at an atomic level? Hollingshead (and the
        Cambridge physicist) suggests that the RP focuses the fields
        generated by his device and pumps electrons into the nucleus of
        the iron atoms in the RP. In capturing the electron a proton is
        converted to a neutron and an atom of iron (Fe) becomes an atom
        of manganese (Mn). The RP becomes a source of gravitational
        energy just as a light bulb can be described as a source of
        light (electromagnetic) energy. The RP gradually loses its
        ability to focus the fields because it is increasingly composed
        of manganese rather than iron. This diminishing effect has
        contributed to some of the delays in bringing the technology to
        market. </p>
      <p><b>HAFF</b> </p>
      <p>Ventura and others have persuaded Hollingshead to reveal
        details (PDF) of recent iterations of his device. These include:
      </p>
      <p># Replacement of its fast-spinning rotating rings with a new
        solid state design <br>
        # 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms of lift <br>
        # Seven distinctly different field effects (named "HAFF" 1
        through 7) </p>
      <p>If you think that overcoming gravity through gravity-lensing
        sounds like science fiction, then the seven HAFF field effects
        associated with gravity-lensing are even more fantastic. Five of
        these fields: HAFF1, HAFF3, HAFF4, HAFF6 and HAFF7 have very
        practical applications. The others are still shrouded in
        secrecy. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="gdaigle4.jpg" height="337" width="266"><br>

          <i>©2005 Paul Horwood (2005)</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>HAFF3 relates to thrust, traction and propulsion -- just the
        thing for providing lift for different forms of transportation
        in the air or in orbit. This is the only field effect generated
        while the device is in motion. The other field effects occur
        when the device is stationary. </p>
      <p>HAFF4 constrains atomic motion and reduces temperatures 100
        degrees K or more. This makes it suitable for transporting
        granular material that would otherwise shift its load, or bulk
        material degraded either by chemical reaction or internally
        produced heat. </p>
      <p>HAFF6 produces standing fields, shearing fields and membrane
        fields. Shear fields are suitable for manufacturing processes
        such as punching, shearing and forming of sheet material.
        Standing fields are suitable for well walls, windows, flood
        defenses (are you listening New Orleans?). Membrane fields
        reportedly can be struck with a mallet and the mallet bounces
        off. HAFF6 fields reportedly can be breached with HAFF1 fields.
      </p>
      <p>Less physical in their outcomes are HAFF7 fields which
        influence light and electromagnetic fields. Potential
        applications from these fields include lens optics, light
        sculptures and 3D displays. </p>
      <p><b>Social Sea Changes</b> </p>
      <p>The demonstration of controlled gravity-lensing would be a sea
        change in everyday life. There isn't a part of our society that
        wouldn't be affected. Preparing the next generation of
        engineers, planners and designers to employ HAFF fields would be
        the first step. How would we imagine the "antigravity" age?
        Then, how do we design it? </p>
      <p>Science fiction writer-critic Ed Bryant was once quoted to have
        said, "If this were 1890, it would take an inventor to predict
        the automobile, and it would take a real visionary to predict
        highways and gas stations. But it would take a science fiction
        writer to predict the traffic jam." </p>
      <p>Demonstrating a gravity-lensing generator today would be the
        equivalent of demonstrating an electric generator in the early
        1800s. It changes the rules. What will be the everyday
        applications of this technology in transportation, architecture
        and manufacturing? How will such a technology change social
        institutions, commuting, privacy or land ownership rights? How
        does a potentially disruptive and destabilizing technology
        establish itself without the creative destruction of existing
        industries? And how long before it just becomes part of the
        background of everyday living? </p>
      <p>When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web it took
        entrepreneurs almost no time to imagine the social impact of
        browsers and Web sites. If gravity-lensing is successfully
        demonstrated it could be adopted faster than was the Web. </p>
      <p>No doubt there will also be a Web extension for gravity
        devices, though its difficult to imagine now what it would be.
        Like the Web's spawning of "i" devices (iMac, iTunes, iPod) and
        "e" services (email, e-commerce, e-learning, e-government),
        start looking for "g" devices and services to proliferate. </p>
      <p><b>Public Policy</b> </p>
      <p>If gravity-lensing is demonstrated then public policy planning
        can not afford to wait for wide public acceptance. Every
        industry potentially threatened by it would begin lobbing for
        state legislation restricting use and protecting existing
        commercial interests. Recently, citywide wireless broadband
        technologies have similarly been blocked by protectionist state
        legislation backed by threatened cable and telecom providers. </p>
      <p>Federal and international regulations should be established to
        develop standards for usage. International bodies overseeing
        transportation, trade, manufacturing and other arenas should
        seek coordination of oversight. Each nation, province, state,
        even local municipalities would need to develop plans for
        embracing a technology that could potentially disrupt their
        economic base in unforeseen ways. </p>
      <p>Just navigating those waters would be a growth industry. But
        it's also an opportunity for institutes and schools of public
        policy, technology management, transportation, architecture and
        design to anticipate, forecast, and get ahead of a pending
        (gravity) wave. </p>
