        <p><b>Gillbert Darida</b> </p>
        <p><b>in <i>The Invention Encyclopedia, </i>pp. 204-207 (
            1930, Geo. Constantinescu, Ed. )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>"The Earth has its own negative electricity, in the soil, and
        the atmosphere which surrounds the Earth is charged with
        positive electricity. The electric potential (the voltage)
        increases with the altitude, so we can say that the electric
        force is proportional to the atmospheric altitude (after
        Franklin, Quetelet, Lord Kelvin, Mascart, Joubert and other
        scientists). </p>
      <p>The recent observations demonstrate that the air at 6000-7000
        meters in altitude, is very highly charged with positive
        electricity, which could be explained by the friction between
        the external photosphere and the upper atmosphere of Earth,
        which rotates at a speed of more than 100,000 Kilometer per
        hour. </p>
      <p>In that way, the Earth works like an electrostatic generator
        with electric charging by influence --- the upper atmosphere is
        positively charged by influence and the Earth crust obtains the
        negative polarity. </p>
      <p>Between the two environments, the air and the soil, and inside
        the low atmosphere, in conditions of good weather, there are
        sbout 800 positive ions and also, 680 negative ion (and
        electrons) in just one square-centimeter of normal ionised air.
      </p>
      <p>The Earth behaves like an huge electric armature negatively
        charged, which repels the electrons and attracts the positive
        ions. That positive ions' attraction determinates an electric
        current, also called "convective current". That's like an
        invisible continous bombardment, subject to daily and seasonal
        variations, which could be aproximated at <b>3 x 10 ^ -16
          Amperes per square-centimeter,</b> and that is a total value
        of 1500 Amperes for the entire surface of the Earth. <br>
        The question is --- how does this current always maintains the
        same direction ? We can suppose that the natural radioactive
        emissions of the soil is responsable for this. We also know that
        radioactive emissions of the Earth works usually near the soil
        surface, and that explains the ionisation phenomenona inside
        caves. </p>
      <p>The ionisation of the low atmosphere could also be the effect
        of the radioactive emissions of the Earth, especially when the X
        radiation works. Also, the Earth atmosphere is ionisated by the
        external radiation proceeding from the Sun and from the space
        environment, especially the action of ultraviolet radiation and
        the electron fascicles emitted by the Sun surface, at the
        temperature of 6000 deg. Celsius. </p>
      <p>The capture of atmosphere electricity has been used in France,
        with aerial cables mounted on the Mont Blanc, and also in
        Germany --- with conductive cables carried by the captive
        baloons. </p>
      <p>The atmosphere electricity collect system invented by eng.
        Jules Guillot is most ingenious and it relies on "the <b>electric







          siphon</b>" [ <i>m.n. --- the discharging devices or
          spark-gap used today from the protection of aerial electric
          cables against the atmospheric electricity ; Jules Guillot has
          thought to recuperate and to use that electricity </i>]. </p>
      <p>His method consisted in the direct "pumping" of the atmosphere
        electricity using a collecting device which had two antennae and
        several collecting rods. </p>
      <p>One antenna is <b>vertical</b> and it has a lot of <b>rods</b>
        scattered like an opened <b>fan</b>, with the tips against the
        <b>zenith</b>, for collecting the <b>negative</b> electricity
        which comes from the air ; the <b>horizontal</b> antenna is
        orientated against the <b>South</b> and its role is to collect
        the <b>positive</b> electricity. </p>
      <p>The air electricity seems to have the double-polarity, as we
        can see at two electrised clouds when between them apears the
        electric discharge. The air could have different electric
        charging and the ionisation processus of atmosphere is very
        heterogenous. The inventor Guillot used <b>two separated and
          insulated armatures with the positive armature against the
          South</b> ( more precisely, against the <b>Equator</b>...)
        and the <b>negative</b> armature against the <b>zenith</b>. </p>
      <p>We can see in the scheme : </p>
      <p>1,- the device P is the "<b>collector apparatus</b>" having <b>15-20
meters








          height</b> ; it also has a lot of <b>rods</b> which are
        scattered <b>fan</b>-like, all this on top of an <b>iron
          pillar</b> ; and also an <b>horizontal antenna</b> S oriented
        against the <b>South</b> ; the two antennae are disposed at <b>90








          deg. angle</b> forming the two armatures where the electrical
        tension must apear. As the <b>height</b> of the pillar <b>increases</b>,
        the <b>voltage</b> increases more and more ; </p>
      <p>2,- a system of <b>lightning-rods</b> ( p1, p2, p3 ) for
        protection against discharges of atmospheric electricity during
        storms; </p>
      <p>3,- the regulator system (<b>voltage regulator</b>, etc) R ; </p>
      <p>4,- the electric <b>resistors</b> ( Cn ) for absorbing the
        parasite currents ; </p>
      <p>5,- the "electric siphons" which have the role of making a
        magnetic field as a good environment for the transport of the
        ionized fluid, absorbing the electricity from the air ; the E1
        and E2 are their regulator devices ; </p>
      <p>6,- an <b>auxilliary continous current power supply</b> which
        send the current against an special <b>excitation coil</b>,
        used as starting device ; it works only when the system is
        starting. <br>
        This collector device works very good for lighting and heating.
        The device made by Guillot had <br>
        <b>20 meters height</b> on the total surface of <b>3
          square-meters</b>. Also, J.Guillot used and electrical
        transformer for the industrial utilization of this "collector"
        --- as power supply for industrial electric engines." </p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">Combined Apparatus for Capture of
                Atmospheric Electric Currents with Immediate
                Implementation</font></b> </p>
          <p><b>25 January 1924</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>We know that earth with its constitution, its rotation and
          movement in space, provides the electricity in the atmosphere.
          The electrical currents escape into space or largely
          accumulate towards the equator, as a result of the greater
          periphery of the globe. </p>
        <p>In the atmosphere, there are two clearly distinct poles,
          i.e., clouds that can be electrically positive or negative;
          everything in nature shows this, otherwise it would be
          difficult to explain the lightning that occurs between the
          clouds and which are none other than contrary cloud electrical
          charges discharged by too close proximity. </p>
        <p>The invention relates to a set of devices capable of
          capturing the atmospheric electricity. </p>
        <p>So far, all searches made for this purpose has been to
          capture the atmosphere, i.e., that brought together into one
          system to capture two poles and opposes&nbsp; effect has been
          to destroy or cancel each other leaving the amount as the
          difference of the strongest to weakest. </p>
        <p>It is therefore easy to understand why, considering the two
          poles of air as about equal, it is almost impossible to
          measure some potential with the land, the highest on the
          lowest remaining which can be positive or negative, copper
          being the strongest of one or other of these polarities. </p>
        <p>It is on this basis that all research until now have been
          made, and that is why we must consider that all the time,
          between the two poles captured in the atmosphere and not in
          any mixture of systems uptake, it is possible to obtain
          tension and intensity, a considerable and measurable&nbsp;
          power captured separately between the two poles&nbsp; and
          remaining isolated from one another until their utilization .
        </p>
        <p>In accordance with this invention, this collection is made by
          attraction of primary electrical currents in teh atmosphere,
          either positively or negatively charged, by an antenna
          that&nbsp; has two points absolutely isolated from one
          another, where one points to the zenith to attract negative
          electricity, and the other turned south, toward the equator to
          draws in the masses grouped in this area. </p>
        <p>This shows and proves the existence of atmospheric electrical
          currents, and that it is possible to capture them with
          specially designed equipment primarily acting as regulators,
          as the persistent difficulty encountered so far in realizing
          their capture lies with large variations of tension in which
          the current atmosphere is present in space, for each of the
          poles, and an overload could inevitably fatal. </p>
        <p>The patent in its present form of presentation does not cover
          the regulators or devices that are anticipated in the system,
          because they can be designed in different ways and give the
          same result, but covers the application and grouping of
          equipment operating as automatic relays with variable
          influence to limit current tension to that chosen for
          utilization. </p>
        <p>These devices have a role associated with an overflow
          reservoir outside carrying excess liquid; these regulators
          will divert the excess voltage flows to ground. </p>
        <p>We can still absorb these regulators having filters because
          they have the sole purpose of diverting the post being used ,
          currents that are not yet known but likely that we will call
          for simplicity,&nbsp; abnormal currents. [sic...] </p>
        <p>The patent also covers systems for regulating currents,
          applied to each of the poles because it is recognized that the
          shape and tension of the currents of the two poles are not
          equivalent. </p>
        <p>The method of capture is by special antenna has directed two
          points in the atmosphere, as will be stated after this, with
          Boot ecoulement prior to the current atmosphere is also of
          great importance. </p>
        <p>Finally, the current atmospheric reception is adequate even
          with the installation of a post, which can be expected at any
          location without the need for special altitude, as has been
          attempted in previous efforts. </p>
        <p>We refer to the attached drawings:. </p>
        <p><b>Figure 1</b> represents in elevation and side view an

        <p>The necessary arrangements to capture atmospheric current
          form is as follows: </p>
        <p>1. The <b>antenna</b> in figure 1 is formed with two peaks:
          the 1 is <b>steel</b>, supported by a <b>bronze ring</b>
          2,&nbsp; surrounded by a <b>spiral form</b> 3; this point is
          oriented for attracting the <b>zenith</b> layers of <b>negative








            electricity</b> and the other edge 4 contains <b>copper
            coils</b> 6, and is oriented <b>south</b> to the <b>equator</b>
          to draw in the masses grouped in this area. To use this
          antenna it suffices to be raised on a mast or <b>pole</b> to
          a height a little higher than that of surrounding houses. </p>
        <p>2. On the table <b>lightning arrestors</b>, contained 4,
          forms of 7 <b>copper horns</b> used to absorb large
          atmospheric discharges by certain time, as it would be
          dangerous to allow movement in the devices regulators. </p>
        <p>3. On a table of <b>two</b> symmetrical systems <b>regulators</b>,
          Figure 3, one for each pole, to obtain and allow a
          regularization of large excesses in the current tensions, by
          automatically absorbing surges before passing over the
          surfacea chosen for the desired use. These regulators are
          represented on the drawing by the references R, R1, R2, R3,
          R4. </p>
        <p>4. In the <b>resistance</b> panel in communication with
          regulators, these resistances are formed as <b>spiral coils
            or screens</b> 8, <b>tubes 9 of glass filled with fine coal
            dust , aluminum powder, sulfur and fine copper dust</b>.
          Finally, <b>two </b>special 10 <b>processors</b> and
          constitutes <b>layers</b> of metal&nbsp; forming an <b>absorbant</b>
          for harmful or abnormal currents. </p>
        <p>5. As a source of energy formed <b>auxiliary batteries</b>
          11 and <b>Ruhmkorff coils</b> 12 to get into the antenna
          sufficient attraction by means of an adjustment of intensity,
          which once it begins, allows the constant flow of atmospheric
          current in the system. </p>
        <p>In considering Figure 3, which represents a sort of an
          installation scheme of the device, the reception of
          atmospheric electrical current will, as set out above,
          producing a priming of these currents. This boot is made in
          launching the system which is double to answer each of the
          poles, the current batteries 11 through 12 and reels going to
          the antenna. </p>
        <p>This boot will continue until the disposal of electrical
          current atmosphere is evident by the one or more table lamps L
          of resistance shown in Figure 5. </p>
        <p>Once the lights illuminate it is advisable to charge the
          batteries to boot. Natural flow and constant currents will be
          captured by the regulators , Figure 3; they will regularize in
          tension and in amperage and then directed to use in table
          lamps. </p>
        <p>It has been said above that regulators R, etc., are intended
          and designed to automatically eliminate earth surge currents
          capture and abnormal currents that cannot yet be level but
          that these regulators could be replaced by devices with the
          same function. </p>
        <p>There is therefore no need to describe in detail and
          especially the claims. We only specify that these regulators
          must be proper protection for the purposes described above. </p>
