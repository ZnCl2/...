        </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>David Jones</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Two books have now been written on the daring raid which
        rescued 103 hijack hostages from Entebbe Airport on July 3,
        1976. Numerous interviews and official explanations have been
        given, yet the puzzle remains. </p>
      <p>How did the Israeli rescue mission manage to elude the radar of
        six nations lying beneath or alongside the flight path,
        including that of Uganda? </p>
      <p>The answer to the Entebbe mystery may lie with a 64-year-old
        Canadian appliance repairman and heart patient. </p>
      <p>The first hint of Sid Hurwich's connection with the raid
        filtered out last June at a ceremony in Toronto's Besh Tzedec
        synagogue, where Hurwich was presented with the award of
        Protectors of the State of Israel on behalf of the Zionist
        Organization of Canada for a secret military device he had given
        Israel seven years earlier. </p>
      <p>Six weeks later an item appeared in the <i>Toronto Star</i>
        linking the Hurwich device to the raid on Entebbe. The wire
        services picked it up and the story took off round the world. </p>
      <p>The most detailed account appeared in <i>Foreign Report</i>, a
        confidential diplomatic journal produced by England's
        prestigious <i>Economist</i> magazine. </p>
      <p>In an unsigned article apparently based on Israeli sources, the
        publication reports that "all that could be learned officially
        was that [Hurwich's] invention had been used in the Israeli raid
        at Entebbe last year." The article claims the invention "sends
        out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of magnetic
        fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and
        mechanical devices. </p>
      <p>On the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams
        could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and
        complete radar systems. </p>
      <p>The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that
        would make whole zones safe from bombs or missiles. </p>
      <p>The Israeli's will not divulge what tests have been run, or how
        the Hurwich ray has been developed. </p>
      <p>According to his daughter, Sylvia Winkler, Hurwich "was around
        9 when he started buying broken bicycles and putting them
        together, and when anybody threw out appliances, he would pick
        them up and put them together." </p>
      <p>By 1934, with no training beyond high school, Hurwich had won a
        reputation as the first private appliance repairmen in Canada -
        before that only the manufacturers did repairs. </p>
      <p>By the beginning of the Second World War he was known as a man
        "able to fix just about anything." Ontario Hydro pulled strings
        to keep him out of the army and built a public service
        department around him. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with government restrictions on metals used in
        appliances, the repair business took off. By 1947 he had built
        it up into Shock Electric, which remains one of the largest
        businesses of its kind in Toronto. </p>
      <p>In another building, he started SidCo Company, devoted to
        making electrical parts. When a heart attack in 1950 just about
        killed him, he sold the business and went into a comfortable
        retirement at the age of 36. </p>
      <p>The idea for the Hurwich ray came to him one evening in 1969 as
        he read about a rash of robberies from bank night-deposit
        vaults. "It just clicked what to do," Hurwich says. </p>
      <p>"I picked up the phone to the police --- I knew a lot of the
        boys --- and I told them I think I can stop those thieveries in
        about half an hour." </p>
      <p>Hurwich went to work in his basement with $50 worth of spare
        parts, and within a week had assembled a working model to test
        his theory. </p>
      <p>Inspector Bill Bolton, then head of the police hold-up squad,
        assembled police and bank security officials at Hurwich's home.
      </p>
      <p>"All I can recall," says Bolton "is that it was under the table
        - the device, whatever it was - and there was a bedspread over
        the table. </p>
      <p>He froze my service revolver! You couldn't pull the trigger,
        You couldn't lift it up off the table and even on the table, you
        couldn't pull the trigger". </p>
      <p>Hurwich continues: "And then I said 'Now take a look at your
        watches.'" I remember one of them said, "When did this happen?"
        and I said, "The minute you walked through that door. You walked
        in there about 25 minutes ago. Now look at your watches. You're
        late about 25 minutes." </p>
      <p>As the security officers filed out of his home, Hurwich's wife
        overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about
        the device. </p>
      <p>"That was the first time it ever entered my mind for war or
        army purposes or anything like that," Hurwich says. He went back
        to work in his basement. When he felt the device was ready he
        contacted a brother living in Israel. </p>
      <p>Hurwich had never been to Israel himself but he felt "they
        needed it more than anybody, what with the Arabs saying they'd
        push everyone into the sea." Hurwich received a visit shortly
        afterward from two high-ranking Israeli officers. </p>
      <p>After a brief demonstration they walked out with the working
        model and every plan and design Hurwich had. - (Small enough to
        carry by hand?) </p>
      <p>Hurwich insists his device is not really an invention. He says
        he simply "took one of the oldest BASIC principles of
        electricity and put it to a different use." </p>
      <p>Which principle he won't say, just as he refuses to discuss how
        the device works. It only works on objects that will carry a
        current, he says. It can be aimed and its range depends on its
        power source. </p>
      <p>"Any magnet will stop a watch," explains Dr. Howard White, a
        Toronto consulting engineer. "It sounds to me like a very
        high-intensity electromagnetic field that he is able to project,
        but I don't know how he is generating it." </p>
      <p>White shakes his head skeptically. "From jamming a few guns to
        jamming electronic equipment at long range is a very large leap.
        But anything's possible." </p>
      <p>Hurwich has never patented the device --- he doesn't believe in
        patents. "It's so easy to copy," he says. "I've copied things
        from patents. Just make a few minor changes where they'd have a
        tough time in court proving I'd broken the patent." Nor has he
        received any money for his invention. </p>
      <p>Oppenheimer and Co. of New York wrote recently to "offer any
        service to assist you in determining the commercial feasibility
        of your work, and exploring avenues to bring your work to useful
        commercial purposes." </p>
      <p>Hurwich says, "At this stage money doesn't enter my mind. I am
        not a youngster and I can't take it with me." </p>
