      </center>
      <p>Rudolf W. Gunnerman has a tiger by the tail --- the Exxon
        tiger. If the technology that the 66-year-old inventor has spent
        $6 million and the past seven years developing lives up to his
        claims, cars and trucks could one day be running on a fraction
        of the gasoline and diesel fuel they now use. Ditto for buses,
        planes, trains, and anything else powered by an
        internal-combustion engine --- from lawn mowers to huge
        electrical generators. </p>
      <p>Gunnerman claims to have a technology that enables engines to
        burn a mixture of half fuel, half water. Yes, water. What's
        more, he says, the mixture gets 40% better mileage from the
        gasoline it contains and emits significantly less pollution
        because engines run cooler. In particular, tailpipes emit
        virtually no nitrogen oxides --- the principal source of smog. </p>
      <p>Sound crazy? Maybe, but Caterpillar Inc. is so intrigued that
        in early July it formed a joint venture with A-55 LP,
        Gunnerman's tiny, nine-person company in Reno, Nev. A-55 is
        short for aqueous 55%, the amount of water by weight in the
        patented fuels. But the key ingredient is 0.5% of a secret
        emulsifier that enables fuel and water to mix --- and stay
        mixed. Gunnerman financed his work with royalties from other
        patents, especially those covering the making of pellets for
        woodstoves. </p>
      <p><i>NICKEL CATALYST.</i> </p>
      <p>Caterpillar won't discuss the terms of the deal, except to say
        it will contribute staff and resources to the new venture,
        called Advanced Fuels LLC. "It's certainly very exciting
        technology", says James E. Sibley, Cat's technical manager and
        acting general manager of the joint venture. "But a lot of work
        still needs to be done, and a lot of surprises can always crop
        up as you go to product development.'' </p>
      <p>Why does the fuel result in better mileage? Gunnerman believes
        the water gets broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, and the
        hydrogen contributes energy to the combustion process. That's
        because there is one additional trick in his patented process: A
        small piece of nickel must be attached to the crown of each
        piston or the top of the cylinder heads. The nickel seems to act
        as a catalyst in "dissociating" the water, says Gunnerman. </p>
      <p>Hogwash, says David B. Kittelson, a mechanical engineering
        professor at the University of Minnesota. Researchers have been
        burning 50%- water fuels since the 1940s, and "there's this myth
        that you're burning the water". Actually, he says, the water
        just allows the engine to run hotter and not melt. World War II
        bombers wouldn't have been able to get off the runway without
        their water-injection turbochargers. </p>
      <p>Still, Gunnerman's invention has done well in recent tests.
        Reno used it to power a city bus for five months. The Air Force
        put six vehicles through a 14-week obstacle course at its
        Elmendorf base in Alaska. And the Minnesota Transportation Dept.
        hosted an event last December featuring five vehicles that
        journeyed 2,000 miles from Reno. </p>
      <p><i>MILES TO GO.</i> </p>
      <p>In Reno, city bus No.405 began making its daily runs with
        Gunnerman's blend on Oct. 5, 1993. It racked up 11,292 miles by
        Feb. 22, when the engine was removed and shipped to Caterpillar
        for study. Bruce Anderson, maintenance superintendent of Reno's
        Regional Transportation Commission, kept tabs on performance and
        found a 29% increase in mileage per gallon of diesel fuel ---
        with no unusual problems. </p>
      <p>In Minnesota, Gregory Felt, chief operations engineer for the
        state's Transportation Dept., admits he was "the biggest skeptic
        around". So he asked Gunnerman's team for a live demo: Mix up a
        fresh batch with local tap water and diesel fuel. When the blend
        was used to fire up a model 453 engine from Detroit Diesel Inc.,
        "it had the cleanest exhaust I've ever seen coming out of a
        diesel", says Felt. "If it really does what it seems, this is
        big.'' </p>
      <p>How big? "If this proves out, it could reduce the U.S. trade
        deficit by almost half, by eliminating the need to import oil",
        says John D. Peters, who tracks emerging transportation
        technology for Minnesota. </p>
      <p>Converting an existing gasoline engine to run A-55 fuel would
        cost less than $500, Gunnerman predicts --- including a new
        fuel-injection control chip that could be programmed to detect
        the presence or absence of water and adjust operations
        accordingly. That way, drivers could fill up with regular
        gasoline if they couldn't find A-55. </p>
      <p>Gunnerman's next project: a fuel that would eliminate gasoline
        altogether. He calls it "X fuel". It's a mix of naphtha and
        water. Naphtha comes out of the process of refining oil earlier
        than gasoline, so it costs 50% less. It 's enough to send the
        Exxon tiger into a tizzy. </p>

        <h3>Half Gas, Half Water: Does It Work?</h3>

      <p>RENO, Nev. -- It seems too good to be true, but rigorous tests
        under way in Nevada, California and Illinois show a breakthrough
        fuel that is more than half tap water could power the nation's
        vehicles, train s and gas-powered aircraft by century's end. </p>
      <p>The milky fuel was developed by Reno inventor Rudolf Gunnerman
        and is being pushed through the federal fuels-testing labyrinth
        by Gunnerman and diesel giant Caterpillar Inc. It has passed
        every test thrown at it. </p>
      <p>In virtually all categories, it tops conventional gasoline and
        diesel as a clean, cheap and safe fuel that can be used in
        almost any combustion engine. If it works --- and disinterested
        outsiders who have tested it say it may --- drivers could see
        the price of gasoline cut more than half. </p>
      <p>"Everybody said it cannot work, that I'm a fraud", the
        German-born inventor said, beginning an interview with the
        obligatory denial that he's a crackpot. </p>
      <p>No one's laughing now: Nevada last November certified the
        water-based fuel as a "clean alternative fuel", meaning it can
        be used to meet federal mandates requiring clean fuels in fleets
        and other vehicles. </p>
      <p>The Energy Department is awaiting test data from trials run by
        Caterpillar before passing judgment. If DOE reaches the same
        conclusion as Nevada, Gunnerman's concoction could be used as a
        clean fuel in a ll states. </p>
      <p>Emission trials in Nevada show the fuel not only surpasses
        Environmental Protection Agency tailpipe standards, but also the
        next two rounds of tough California Air Resources Board
        standards reaching deep into the next century. </p>
      <p>Tests show a 60 percent drop in EPA-monitored emissions of such
        pollutants as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide
        or NOX, a component of smog. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is made out of a plentiful clear liquid,
        naphtha, produced in early stages of petroleum refining,
        skipping the later processes that produce various grades of
        diesel and gasoline. </p>
      <p>The fuel can be interchanged with today's conventional fuels,
        meaning converted vehicles can run on either fuel with no change
        in performance but improved mileage and substantial exhaust
        reductions. </p>
      <p>Other benefits that have surfaced in development and field
        trials of the "A-21" (aqueous fuel for the 21st century) fuel: </p>
      <p>At the refinery, naphtha, used today as a hardener in road
        tars, is siphoned off and trucked or piped to a blending
        facility to be mixed with water to produce the fuel. That
        eliminates up to 90 percen t of refinery pollutants. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Naphtha is easier to extract from sources such as oil
        shale and sand tars, meaning those hard-to-work sources could be
        exploited. As the amount of petroleum in gasoline falls, so do
        oil imports. </p>
      <p>Once mixed with the water and a tiny amount of an agent to keep
        the naphtha and water from separating, the fuel has a vapor
        pressure of about one-fifth that of gasoline. That means
        vapor-recovery systems won't be needed at the pump. Because
        gasoline vapor is what catches fire, this fuel is virtually
        immune to explosions and fire. </p>
      <p>The fuel can be used in any diesel or spark-ignited engine.
        That includes train locomotives, which currently use a billion
        gallons of fuel a year; certain aircraft; recreational vehicles;
        and diesel g enerators, which must be limited today due to their
        high emissions. </p>
      <p>Gunnerman, who spent eight years finding a way to keep water
        and fuel blended, admits the new A-21 fuel might still be
        dismissed as a fraud if not for the considerable clout of
        Caterpillar, which is bank ing on the fuel to help it win back
        diesel business lost to Detroit through the years. </p>
      <p>He said his giant partner "has been very helpful in
        legitimizing me... It's easier if 52,000 people are out there
        fighting the battle with you". </p>
      <p>His company, A-55 Limited Partnership, joined Caterpillar's
        Engine Division in 1994 to form Advanced Fuels, a venture to
        test and market the new fuel. </p>
      <p>Tests on a city bus in Reno, on a free-standing power generator
        that for four months has been feeding electricity to Reno's
        electric grid, on generators at Cat's Illinois plants, and now
        in public and pr ivate vehicle fleets in Sacramento show A-21
        works as claimed. </p>
      <p>"The Advanced Fuels joint venture is one we entered into
        because we believe this fuel is one of the most promising
        alternative fuels that's out there today", said Caterpillar
        spokeswoman Marsha Hausser. She said Caterpillar is testing
        other fuels, but "we've been pleased with the test results we
        have seen so far. We do have more tests to conduct, and we want
        to verify in our minds in the long term that this is a viable
        alternative. </p>
      <p>"Any time you have an alternative that is cleaner burning, less
        flammable, and allows you to operate an engine more efficiently,
        that's a significant advance", Hausser said. Test results remain
        confidential, she said. </p>
      <p>Alan Stout of EPA's National Fuel and Emissions Laboratory in
        Ann Arbor, Mich., said his lab has been watching the A-21 story
        develop. While he questioned whether this new fuel could replace
        conventional fuels in the short term, he said EPA continues to
        monitor tests on fleets. </p>
      <p>The most frequently heard concern is that, with so much water,
        A-21 might be prone to freezing or cold-start problems. After
        testing earlier formulas, enough antifreeze was added that test
        vehicles have not had problems in the cold. Industry analysts
        also say it may require a small amount of ethanol in the blend
        for storage in tanks to winterize it for temperatures of at
        least 40 below zero. </p>
      <p>Examining a prototype "automated blending facility" that is
        about to start mixing 40,000 gallons of fuel daily, Gunnerman
        said the major hurdle before the fuel will start showing up at
        gas stations is Energy Department certification that it
        qualifies as a clean alternative fuel. </p>
      <p>"How fast we'll do it will not depend alone on Cat and us",
        Gunnerman said. "It will also depend on DOE and EPA and how fast
        we can push it". </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a novel aqueous fuel for an internal
        combustion engine and to a novel method of combusting such fuel
        in an internal combustion engine as well as to a novel fuel
        mixture which results from the introduction of the aqueous fuel
        into the combustion chamber of an internal combustion chamber in
        the presence of a hydrogen-producing catalyst. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>There is a need for new fuels to replace diesel and gasoline
        for use in internal combustion engines, especially engines used
        in motor vehicles. Internal combustion engines operating on
        gasoline and diesel fuel produce unacceptably high amounts of
        pollutants which are injurious to human health and may damage
        the earth's atmosphere. The adverse effects of such pollutants
        upon health and the atmosphere have been the subject of great
        public discussion. Undesirable pollutants result from combustion
        of carbonaceous fuel with combustion air that contains nitrogen.
        The relatively large amounts of air used to combust conventional
        fuels is therefore, a primary reason for unsatisfactory levels
        of pollutants emitted by vehicles with internal combustion
        engines. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>A novel fuel and fuel mixture, and novel method of combustion,
        have been discovered which will reduce pollutants produced by
        internal combustion engines operated with conventional
        carbonaceous fuels such as gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene
        fuels, alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol, and mixtures
        thereof. The new fuel mixture is also much less expensive than
        carbonaceous fuel such as gasoline or diesel fuel because its
        primary ingredient is water. The term "internal combustion
        engine" as used herein is intended to refer to and encompass any
        engine in which carbonaceous fuel is combusted with oxygen in
        one or more combustion chambers of the engine. Presently known
        such engines include piston displacement engines, rotary engines
        and turbine (jet) engines. </p>
      <p>The novel aqueous fuel of the present invention has less than
        the potential energy of carbonaceous fuels but is nonetheless
        capable of developing at least as much power. For example, an
        aqueous fuel of the invention comprising water and gasoline has
        about 1/3 the potential energy (BTU's) of gasoline, but when
        used to operate an internal combustion engine, it will produce
        approximately as much power as compared with the same amount of
        gasoline. This is indeed surprising and is believed to be due to
        the novel fuel mixture that results from the release of hydrogen
        and oxygen and the combustion of hydrogen when the novel aqueous
        fuel is introduced to a combustion chamber of an internal
        combustion engine and combusted with relatively small amounts of
        combustion air in the presence of a hydrogen-producing catalyst
        by the novel method of the present invention. </p>
      <p>In its broadest aspects, the aqueous fuel of the present
        invention comprises substantial amounts of water, e.g., up to
        about 70 to about 80 percent by volume of the total volume of
        aqueous fuel, and a gaseous or liquid carbonaceous fuel such as
        gasoline, ethanol, methanol, diesel fuel, kerosene-type fuel,
        other carbon-containing fuels, such as butane, natural gas,
        etc., or mixtures thereof. In utilizing this fuel with the novel
        method of the present invention, aqueous fuel and combustion air
        are introduced into the engine's fuel introduction system, for
        receiving and mixing fuel and combustion air and introducing the
        fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber(s). Such systems
        may include a conventional carburetor or fuel injection system.
        Although it is not necessary for the practice of the invention,
        when using an engine with a carburetor, the combustion air may
        be preheated to from about 350°&nbsp; F. to about 400°&nbsp; F.
        as it enters the carburetor. When using an engine with a fuel
        injection system, the combustion air may be preheated from about
        122° F. to about 158°&nbsp; F. as it enters the fuel injection
        system. The air/fuel mixture is introduced into the combustion
        chamber or chambers and combusted in the presence of a
        hydrogen-producing catalyst which facilitates the dissociation
        of water in the aqueous fuel into hydrogen and oxygen so that
        the hydrogen is combusted with the carbonaceous fuel to operate
        the engine. </p>
      <p>The term "hydrogen-producing catalyst" is used herein in its
        broadest sense. A catalyst as generally defined is a substance
        that causes or accelerates activity between two or more forces
        without itself being affected. In the present invention it is
        known that without this substance present in the combustion
        chamber, as described herein, combustion of the aqueous fuel
        does not take place in such a way as to produce the desired
        degree of power to operate the internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that
        upon generation of an electric spark in a combustion chamber
        with a wet atmosphere in the presence of poles formed of
        hydrogen-producing catalyst, the electrical discharge
        electrifies the mass of water present in liquid or gaseous form,
        e.g., steam vapor, to enable the electric charge to travel to
        the negatively charged catalytic poles to effect discharge of
        the electric charge. Dissociation of water molecules appears to
        occur upon exposure of the mass of water molecules to the
        electric charge in combination with the heat of combustion
        resulting from combustion of the carbonaceous material component
        of the aqueous fuel during the compression stroke which, along
        with combustion of released hydrogen, provides the power to
        operate the engine. </p>
      <p>Although in the presently preferred embodiment it is preferred
        to use two catalytic poles of hydrogen-producing catalyst, one,
        or more than two poles, also may be used to disperse the
        electric charge. In addition, although the normal spark of
        standard motor vehicle spark plug systems generating about
        25,000 to 28,000 volts may be used, it is presently preferred to
        generate a hotter spark, e.g., generated by about 35,000 volts.
        Electric spark generating systems are available of up to 90,000
        volts and it appears that higher voltages result in better
        dissociation of water molecules in the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>As indicated previously, one of the advantages of the invention
        is that internal combustion engines may be operated with novel
        fuels and fuel mixtures that require significantly less
        combustion air for combustion of the fuel in the engine's
        combustion chamber. For example, gasoline used as fuel for an
        internal combustion engine employing a carburetor generally
        requires an air to fuel ratio of 14 to 16:1 to produce
        satisfactory power output to operate the engine and power a
        motor vehicle. Alcohol, such as pure ethanol, may utilize an air
        to fuel ratio of 8 or 9:1 for satisfactory performance of the
        same engine. In contrast to such conventional fuels, the aqueous
        fuel of the present invention utilizes a lesser, controlled
        amount of combustion air. It has been determined that it is
        critical for the practice of the invention to employ an air to
        fuel ratio of not greater than 5:1 for equivalent satisfactory
        performance of an internal combustion engine. The preferred air
        to fuel ratio in accordance with the invention is from 0.5:1 to
        about 2:1; with an optimum air to fuel ratio in the range of
        0.5:1 to 1.5:1 and, most optimally 1:1. </p>
      <p>The reason that the aqueous fuel and the fuel mixture of the
        present invention can produce satisfactory internal combustion
        engine results is that in practicing the invention hydrogen and
        oxygen are released in the combustion chamber. The hydrogen and
        oxygen result from dissociation of water molecules and the
        hydrogen is combusted along with the carbonaceous fuel of the
        aqueous mixture. The result is that comparable engine power
        output is achieved with less carbonaceous fuel and less
        combustion air than can be achieved using conventional
        combustion of the same carbonaceous fuel with greater amounts of
        combustion air. </p>
      <p>It is further noted that with the aqueous fuel of the present
        invention the water component vaporizes as steam in the
        combustion chamber. Steam expands to a greater extent than air
        and the combustion chamber can be suitably filled with less
        combustion air. Thus, the water component of the fuel transforms
        to steam which expands in the combustion chamber and replaces a
        portion of the combustion air used in combusting conventional
        fuels in the engine's combustion chamber. The expansion of the
        steam together with the combustion of the hydrogen released by
        dissociation of the water molecules results in generation of the
        required power output necessary for satisfactory operation of
        the engine. </p>
      <p>It has been previously pointed out, that the amount of
        combustion air provided in the combustion chamber for combustion
        with the aqueous fuel of the invention must be critically
        controlled so that an air to fuel ratio of not greater than 5:1
        is present during combustion. It has been determined that if too
        much air, i.e., greater than a ratio of air to fuel of 5:1, is
        introduced with the aqueous fuel into the combustion chamber,
        incomplete combustion of the carbonaceous fuel results because
        of the excess of oxygen in the combustion chamber. Excess oxygen
        over that required to combust the carbonaceous fuel results when
        the ratio of air to fuel is too high due to a combination of the
        amount of oxygen released from dissociation of the water
        molecules and the additional oxygen present in an excessive
        amount of combustion air. Incomplete combustion of the
        carbonaceous fuel results in unsatisfactory performance of the
        engine as well as excess emission of undesirable pollutants. By
        reducing the amount of combustion air required for combustion in
        the combustion chamber, less nitrogen is present in the
        combustion chamber to combine with oxygen and form undesirable
        NOX pollutants emitted during engine operation. Thus, one
        important advantage of the invention is the considerable
        reduction in NOX and other undesirable emission pollutants over
        that which are produced by conventionally operated internal
        combustion engines using conventional carbonaceous fuels such as
        gasoline, diesel fuel, etc. in internal combustion engines. </p>
      <p>It is also noted that since hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen are
        present in the fuel mixture to be combusted in the combustion
        chamber of an internal combustion engine, in accordance with the
        invention, circumstances may arise in which too little water in
        the aqueous fuel would be unsatisfactory. For example, where the
        carbonaceous fuel has a low inherent energy output, i.e. low
        potential energy of BTU output per unit volume, greater amounts
        of water may be desirable because the release of hydrogen and
        oxygen by dissociation of water molecules and combustion of the
        hydrogen will usefully increase the total energy output of the
        carbonaceous fuel and water mixture. For this reason, a lower
        limit of between 20 and 25% water, e.g., greater than 20% water,
        is established as the useful, practical, minimum amount of water
        in the aqueous fuel mixture of the present invention so as to
        accommodate a greater variety of carbonaceous fuels within the
        scope of the invention. The upper limit of 70% to 80% water is
        established because a minimum amount of gaseous or liquid
        carbonaceous fuel is need to initiate the reaction, triggered by
        a spark generated in the combustion chamber that dissociates the
        water molecules in the combustion chamber. It has been
        determined that from 30,000 BTU energy/gal. of fuel to 60,000
        BTU energy/gal. of fuel is preferred for the water dissociation
        reaction. </p>
      <p>The aqueous fuel of the present invention comprises water from
        greater than about 20 percent to about 70 to 80 percent by
        volume of the total volume of the aqueous fuel and, preferably,
        a volatile liquid carbonaceous fuel, such as a fuel selected
        from the group consisting of alcohols, e.g., ethanol or
        methanol, gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene-type fuel, or mixtures
        thereof. Alcohols such as ethanol and methanol generally contain
        small percentages of water when produced commercially and, of
        course, include oxygen and hydrogen in the molecular structure.
        Commercial grades of ethanol and methanol are marketed in terms
        of a proof number, such as for example, 100 proof ethanol. One
        half the proof number is generally an indication of the amount
        of ethanol present, i.e., 100 proof ethanol contains 50 vol
        percent ethyl alcohol and 50 percent water; 180 proof ethanol
        contains 90 percent of ethyl alcohol and 10 percent of water,
        etc. </p>
      <p>The aqueous fuel of the present invention is believed to be
        usable in all internal combustion engines, including
        conventional gasoline or diesel powered internal combustion
        engines for use in automobiles, trucks and the like, using
        conventional carburetors or fuel injection systems as well as
        rotary engines and turbine (jet) engines. The invention is
        believed to be useable in any engine in which volatile liquid
        carbonaceous fuel is combusted with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in
        one or more combustion chambers of the engine. </p>
      <p>Few modifications are necessary to make such engines usable
        with the fuel of the present invention. For example,
        installation of a hydrogen-producing catalyst in the combustion
        chamber or chambers of the engine, such as described elsewhere
        herein, to act as a catalyst in the dissociation of water
        molecules to yield hydrogen and oxygen must be made. In
        addition, suitable means to supply and control the input,
        quantity and flow, of combustion air and fuel to the combustion
        chamber(s) is important for optimum engine operation. It is
        noted in this regard that the air:fuel ratio is a significant
        factor in effecting combustion in the chamber(s). It is also
        desirable, from a practical point of view, to make the fuel
        supply and fuel storage systems of rust proof materials. A
        higher voltage electric spark system than generally used in
        internal combustion engines of motor vehicles operated with
        conventional carbonaceous fuels, e.g., gasoline, is also
        preferred. Systems to provide a "hotter spark" are available
        commercially, such as from Chrysler Motor Company. As a further
        modification to optimize use of the invention, it is desirable
        to employ a computer assisted electronically controlled system
        to supply fuel to fuel injectors during the intake stroke of the
        internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>The dissociation of water molecules, per se, is well known. For
        example, the thermo-dynamics and physical chemistry of
        water/steam dissociation are described in the text entitled
        "Chemistry of Dissociated Water Vapor and Related Systems" by M.
        Vinugopalan and R.A. Jones, 1968, published by John Wiley &amp;
        Sons, Inc.; "Physical Chemistry for Colleges", by E.B. Mellard,
        1941, pp 340-344 published by McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.,
        and "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry", by F. Albert Cotton and
        Geoffrey Wilkinson, 1980, pp 215-228; the disclosures of which
        are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>Although not required for the practice of the invention, a
        heater to preheat the combustion air for the engine and a heat
        exchanger to use the hot exhaust gases from the engine to
        preheat the combustion air after the engine is operating, at
        which time the heater is shut off, may also be installed.
        Although the presently preferred embodiment of the invention
        does not require preheating combustion air and/or fuel,
        combustion air for the engine may be preheated before it is
        introduced into a carburetor or fuel injection system. When
        using an engine with a carburetor, the combustion air may be
        preheated to from about 350.degree. F. to about 400.degree. F.
        as it enters the carburetor. When using an engine with a fuel
        injection system, the combustion air may be preheated from about
        122.degree. F. to about 158.degree. F. as it enters the fuel
        injection system. In such cases, the aqueous fuel of the present
        invention is introduced into the carburetor or fuel injection
        system and is mixed with a controlled amount of combustion air.
        The aqueous fuel is preferably introduced into the carburetor or
        fuel injection system at ambient temperatures. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, introduced into the carburetor or
        fuel injection system at ambient temperatures and the air/fuel
        mixture is then introduced into the combustion chamber or
        chambers where a spark from a spark plug ignites the air/fuel
        mixture in the conventional manner when the piston of the
        combustion chamber reaches the combustion stage of the
        combustion cycle. The presence of a hydrogen-producing catalyst
        in the combustion chamber is believed to act as a catalyst for
        the dissociation of water molecules in the aqueous fuel when the
        spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture. The hydrogen and oxygen
        released by dissociation are also ignited during combustion to
        increase the amount of energy delivered by the fuel. It has been
        observed in experiments using 100 proof alcohol as the engine
        fuel that the engine produced the same power output, i.e., watts
        per hour, as is produced with the same volume of gasoline. This
        is indeed surprising in view of the fact that the 100 proof
        ethanol has a theoretical energy potential of about 48,000 BTU's
        per gallon, with a usable potential of about 35,000 to 37,500
        BTU's per gallon, as compared to gasoline, which has an energy
        potential of about 123,000 BTU's per gallon, nearly three times
        as much. The fact that the lower BTU ethanol is able to generate
        as much power as a higher BTU gasoline suggests that additional
        power is attributable to the liberation, i.e., dissociation and
        combustion of hydrogen and oxygen from the water. </p>
      <p>Inasmuch as 100 proof ethanol has been found to be a
        satisfactory fuel in using the method of the present invention,
        it is apparent that other suitable fuels may be made by blending
        by use of other alcohols and by blending alcohols with gasoline,
        kerosene type fuels or diesel fuel, depending on whether the
        fuel is to be used in a gasoline, turbine or diesel powered
        engine. Experimental work also indicates that 84 proof (42
        percent water) ethanol may also be used as a fuel and it is
        believed that aqueous fuels containing as much 70 to 80 percent
        water may be used. </p>
      <p><b>THE ENGINE WITH CARBURETOR</b> </p>
      <p>To demonstrate one embodiment of the present invention, an
        engine was selected which also had the capacity to measure a
        predetermined workload. The engine selected was a one-cylinder,
        eight horsepower internal combustion engine connected to a 4,000
        watt per hour a/c generator. The engine/generator was
        manufactured by the Generac Corporation of Waukesha, Wisconsin
        under the trade name Generac, Model No. 8905-0(S4002). The
        engine/generator is rated to have a maximum continuous a/c power
        capacity of 4,000 watts (4.0 KW) single phase. The engine
        specifications are as follows: </p>

      <p>A heat exchanger was installed on the engine to use the hot
        exhaust gases from the engine to preheat the air for combustion.
        A platinum bar was installed at the bottom surface of the engine
        head forming the top of the combustion chamber. The platinum bar
        weighed one ounce and measured 2-5/16 inches in length, 3/4
        inches in width, and 1/16 inch in thickness. The platinum bar
        was secured to the inside of the head with three stainless steel
        screws. </p>
      <p>A second fuel tank having a capacity of two liters was secured
        to the existing one-liter fuel tank. A T-coupling was inserted
        into the existing fuel line of the motor for communication with
        the fuel line for each fuel tank. A valve was inserted between
        the T-coupling and the fuel lines for each fuel tank so that
        either tank could be used separately to feed fuel to the
        carburetor or to mix fuels in the fuel line leading to the
        carburetor. </p>
      <p><b>TEST RUNS</b> </p>
      <p>A series of tests were performed to determine if 100 proof
        ethanol (50% ethanol by volume, balance water) could be used in
        the motor which was modified as described above, and if so, to
        compare the performance of the 100 proof ethanol with the same
        amount of gasoline. </p>
      <p>Two liters of unleaded gasoline were poured into the second
        fuel tank with the valve for the second tank in the closed
        position. Three and eight tenths liters of 100 proof ethanol
        were poured into the one gallon fuel tank with the valve in the
        closed position. The valve for the gasoline tank was opened so
        that the engine could be initially started on gasoline. </p>
      <p>Within three minutes of starting the motor, the combustion air
        entering into the carburetor was measured at 180°&nbsp; F. At
        this point, the fuel valve under the ethanol tank was opened and
        the valve under the gasoline tank was closed. At that point, the
        temperature of the air entering the carburetor had risen to
        200.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Ethanol was now the primary fuel in the motor which exhibited a
        certain amount of roughness during operation until the choke
        mechanism was adjusted by reducing the air intake to the engine
        by approximately 90 percent. Immediately thereafter, two, 1800
        watt, heat guns, having a rated heat output of 400°&nbsp; F,
        were actuated and used to heat the combustion air as it entered
        the carburetor. The temperature of the air from the heat guns
        measured 390°&nbsp; to 395°&nbsp; F. </p>
      <p>After the engine ran on ethanol for approximately 20 minutes,
        the heat measurement in the incoming combustion air stabilized
        between 347°&nbsp; F. and 352°&nbsp; F. The engine was run on
        the 100 proof ethanol fuel for 40 additional minutes, for a
        total of one hour, until two liters of ethanol had been used.
        The valve under the ethanol tank was then closed and the engine
        was turned off by opening the choke. Eighteen hundred
        milliliters of ethanol were left remaining in the tank. </p>
      <p>The choke was then reset to the 90 percent closed position, and
        the engine was started once again. The engine responded
        immediately and ran as smoothly on 100 proof ethanol as it did
        during the one-hour operation. </p>
      <p>The engine was stopped and started in the same manner on three
        separate occasions thereafter with the same results. </p>
      <p>While operating the engine on 100 proof ethanol, the power
        output on the generator was measured and indicated that the
        ethanol produced 36,000 watts of power during a one-hour period
        using two liters of ethanol having energy potential of about
        48,000 BTUs per gallon. </p>
      <p>After the engine had stopped running on ethanol, it was
        operated again with the two liters of gasoline in the gasoline
        tank. Forty seven minutes into the test, the engine stopped
        because it ran out of gasoline. Measurements taken on the
        generator indicated that, when the engine was operated on
        gasoline, it was producing power at a rate of 36,000 watts per
        hour for 47 minutes, using two liters of gasoline having an
        energy potential of about 123,000 BTUs per gallon. </p>
      <p>Comparing these power measurements indicates that two liters of
        100 proof ethanol produced the same amount of power as two
        liters of gasoline. This is surprising inasmuch as the gasoline
        has about 2.5 times as many BTUs as the same amount of 100 proof
        ethanol. This indicates that the extra power from the ethanol
        must be due to the liberation and combustion of hydrogen and
        oxygen from the relatively large amounts of water in the fuel. </p>
      <p>Although gasoline was used as the starter fuel to preheat the
        engine and, thus, generate hot exhaust gases to preheat the
        combustion air, the use of the gasoline as the starter fuel for
        preheating is not necessary and could be replaced with an
        electrical heat pump to preheat the combustion air until the
        heat exchanger can take over and preheat the combustion air,
        whereupon the electrical heat pump would turn off. </p>
      <p>The above tests comparing the use of the 100 proof ethanol and
        gasoline were repeated on three subsequent occasions, each with
        the same results. </p>
      <p>A second series of tests were run which were identical to the
        above, except for the use of 84 proof ethanol (42 percent ethyl
        alcohol and 58 percent water) in place of the 100 proof ethanol.
        However, after running about 30 seconds on the 84 proof ethanol,
        the engine stopped abruptly and released a fair amount of oil
        under high pressure from the main bearing in the main engine.
        The engine was restarted and abruptly stopped again after
        operating for about 20 seconds. </p>
      <p>The above stoppage appears to have been due to preignition of
        the hydrogen and/or oxygen during the up-stroke period of the
        piston which caused pressure build-up in the crank case, which
        in turn forced oil under pressure through the main bearing. The
        pressure inside the combustion chamber appears to have been
        relieved through the piston rings into the crank case, and then
        relieved through the main bearing. </p>
      <p>The premature ignition of the hydrogen and/or oxygen was
        probably caused by generating a larger amount of oxygen and
        hydrogen which did not occur when using 100 proof ethanol having
        a lesser amount of water. </p>
      <p>The preignition problem is believed to be curable by using an
        engine having a shorter piston stroke to reduce the dwell time
        of the fuel, including hydrogen and oxygen, in the combustion
        chamber, or by adjusting the carburetor or the electronically
        controlled fuel injection system to help reducing dwell time to
        avoid generating excessive amount of hydrogen and oxygen. The
        engine used in the experiment had a relatively long piston
        stroke of 6 inches. For the conditions described above, the
        piston stroke should be no more than about 1 1/2 inches or less
        to avoid the preignition problem in that particular engine. </p>
      <p><b>ENGINE WITH ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM</b>
      </p>
      <p>A series of tests were run on an engine having an
        electronically controlled fuel injection system to determine if
        that would solve the preignition problem discussed above. The
        engine used for this purpose was a 3-cylinder turbo charge
        electronically controlled internal combustion engine from a 1987
        Chevrolet Sprint which had been driven about 37,000 miles. </p>
      <p>The head was removed from the motor block and cleaned to remove
        carbon deposits. Three platinum plates were attached to the
        inside of each head so as not to interfere with valves moving
        inside the heads during operation. Each platinum plate was 1
        centimeter in length and width and was 1/32 of an inch in
        thickness. Each platinum plate was attached to a head with one
        stainless steel screw through the center of each piece. Carbon
        deposits were cleaned off each piston head and the engine was
        reassembled using new gaskets. </p>
      <p>The combustion air intake hose which exits from the turbo and
        leads to the injector module was divided in the middle and
        attached to a heat exchanger to cool the combustion air
        delivered to the injector. The heat exchanger was bypassed by
        using two Y-junctions on either side of the heat exchanger and
        by putting a butterfly valve on the side closest to the turbo so
        that the hot air stream could be diverted around the heat
        exchanger and introduced directly into the injector module. All
        pollution abatement equipment was removed from the engine but
        the alternator was kept in place. The transmission was
        reattached to the engine because the starter mount is attached
        to the transmission. The transmission was not used during the
        testing. This engine was inserted into a Chevrolet Sprint car
        having a tailpipe and muffler system so that the engine was able
        to run properly. The catalytic converter was left in the exhaust
        train but the inside of the converter was removed as it was not
        needed. Two one-gallon plastic fuel tanks were hooked up to the
        fuel pump by a T-section having manual valves so the fuel to the
        fuel pumped could be quickly changed by opening or closing the
        valves. </p>
      <p><b>TEST RUNS</b> </p>
      <p>A series of test runs were performed to determine how the
        engine as modified above would run using a variety of fuels. </p>
      <p>The first test utilized 200 proof methanol as a starter fluid.
        The engine started and operated when the fuel pressure was
        raised to 60 to 75 lbs. When using gasoline, the fuel pressure
        is generally set at 3.5 to 5 lbs. </p>
      <p>While the engine was running on the 200 proof methanol, the
        fuel was changed to 100 proof denatured ethanol and the motor
        continued operating smoothly at 3500 revolutions per minute
        (rpm). After about two minutes the test was stopped and the
        engine shut down because the fuel hoses were bulging and became
        unsafe. These hoses were replaced with high pressure hoses and
        the plastic couplings and the T's were also replaced with copper
        couplings and T's. A new pressure gage was attached. During the
        testing, it was noted that the fuel mixture needed more
        combustion air and that the computerized settings of the engine
        could not be adjusted to provide the additional air. To overcome
        this, the air intake valve was opened. </p>
      <p>After these modifications, a new series of tests were performed
        using 200 proof methanol in one of two fuel tanks. The engine
        started on the 200 proof methanol and the rpm setting was
        adjusted to 3500. The engine was allowed to run for a few
        minutes. During that time, the fuel pressure was adjusted and it
        was noted that 65 lbs. of pressure appeared to be adequate. A
        thermocouple was inserted close to the injector module and
        provided a reading of 65°&nbsp; C. after about 5 minutes. </p>
      <p>A fuel mixture comprising 500 ml of distilled water and 500 ml
        of 200 proof methanol were put into the second fuel tank this
        fuel and was used to operate the engine. Without changing the
        air flow, the temperature of the combustion air rose from
        65°&nbsp; to 75°&nbsp; C. after about 1 minute. The rpm reading
        dropped to 3100 rpm. The engine ran very smoothly and was turned
        off and restarted without difficulty. </p>
      <p>The next step in the test series was to determine how
        variations in the water content of the fuel effected engine
        performance. Using 199 proof denatured ethanol as starter fuel,
        the engine started immediately. The fuel pressure setting was
        reduced from 65 lbs. to 50 lbs, the combustion air measured
        65°&nbsp; C., the rpm's measured 3500, and the engine ran
        smoothly. </p>
      <p>The fuel was then changed into 160 proof denatured ethanol. The
        fuel pressure was maintained at 50 lbs. The combustion air
        temperature was measured at 67°&nbsp; C., the rpm's decreased to
        3300, and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, the fuel was changed to 140 proof denatured
        ethanol. The combustion air temperature rose to 70°&nbsp; C.,
        the rpm's rose to 3500, and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, the fuel was changed to 120 proof denatured
        ethanol. The combustion air temperature increased to 73°&nbsp;
        C., the rpm's decreased to 3300, and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, the fuel was changed to 100 proof denatured
        ethanol. The combustion air temperature increased to 74°&nbsp;
        C., the rpm's decreased to 3100, and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, the fuel was changed to 90 proof denatured
        ethanol. The combustion air temperature remained at 74°&nbsp;
        C., the rpm's reduced to 3100, and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>After 10 minutes, the fuel was changed to 80 proof denatured
        ethanol. The combustion air temperature raised to 76°&nbsp; C.
        and the rpm's reduced to 2900. At that point, an infrequent
        backfire was noted in the engine. 100 proof denatured ethanol
        was then used as the primary fuel and the bypass to the heat
        exchanger was closed. The combustion air temperature rose to
        160°&nbsp; C. and during the next minutes increased to 170° C.
        The rpm's increased to 4000 rpm and the engine ran smoothly. </p>
      <p>Another series of tests were run with the engine adjusted to
        operate at 3500 rpm's and with the heat exchanger removed so
        that neither the fuel or combustion air were preheated and thus
        were at ambient temperatures. The engine was started with 200
        proof ethanol as the fuel and as soon as the intake air
        temperature at the injector module had risen to about 50°&nbsp;
        C., the fuel was changed to 100 proof ethanol and the engine ran
        smoothly. The intake air temperature rose to 70°&nbsp; C. where
        it stabilized. The engine was turned off, restarted and
        continued to run smoothly. By adjusting and opening the air
        intake, the rpm could be increased to over 4000. By slightly
        closing the same air intake, the rpm could be reduced to 1500.
        At both ranges of rpm, the engine ran smoothly and was turned
        off and restarted without difficulty and continued to run
        smoothly. </p>
      <p>The rpm of an engine using the method and fuel of the present
        invention may be regulated by regulating the amount of air flow
        into the combustion chamber. In a conventional gasoline powered
        engine, the engine rpm is regulated by regulating the amount of
        gasoline that is introduced into the combustion chambers. </p>
      <p>It is evident that the invention involves the use of an aqueous
        fuel which may comprise large amounts of water in proportion to
        volatile carbonaceous fuel. A particularly effective aqueous
        fuel comprises a mixture of approximately 70% water and 30%
        carbonaceous fuel. The thermal energy of the carbonaceous fuel,
        e.g., gasoline, is reduced from the fuels high energy value,
        approximately 120,000 BTU's per volume gallon in the case of
        gasoline, to a BTU content of approximately 35,000 BTU's per
        volume gallon for the 70% water, 30% gasoline mixture. This BTU
        content of the water/gasoline mixture is sufficient to maintain
        a reaction in the combustion chamber of an internal combustion
        engine, such that the water molecule is dissociated and the
        hydrogen molecule (H<sub>2</sub>) is separated from the oxygen
        molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) and the so produced hydrogen gas is
        utilized as a primary power source to move the pistons inside an
        internal combustion engine upon combustion. The invention is
        applicable with a variety of volatile carbonaceous fuels,
        including diesel oil or kerosene, and those fuels can be also
        mixed with up to 80% water (e.g., diesel or kerosene) to achieve
        the same reaction to dissociate hydrogen and oxygen to release
        hydrogen gas to power an internal combustion engine in the
        presence of a hydrogen-producing catalyst. </p>
      <p>For this reaction to take effect, it is necessary to equip each
        combustion cavity inside the internal combustion engine with at
        least one, but preferably two, and maybe more, poles of hydrogen
        producing catalyst, with a melting point above the temperature
        of combustion. Useful catalysts include Ni, Pt, Pt-Ni alloys,
        Ni-stainless steel, noble metals, Re, W, and alloys thereof,
        which may be utilized as a hydrogen producing catalyst in the
        form of catalytic metal poles. Combustion and dissociation is
        initiated by a spark which may be created by a conventional
        electric spark generation system such as is used with
        conventional motor vehicle engines. </p>
      <p>As a further examples of the invention, using fuel and
        combustion air at ambient temperatures I took 3 liters of
        unleaded gasoline (87 octane) with a BTU content of about
        120,000 BTU's per gallon and 7 liters of tap water. I added 10
        ml of surfactant (detergent) into this mixture in a first test
        to enhance mixing of the water with the gasoline. This procedure
        was followed to produce additional mixtures with 25 ml and 40 ml
        of surfactant to obtain the water/gasoline mixture. The same
        procedure was also followed with using tap water which was
        filtered through a deionization unit and charcoal filter to
        remove the chlorine and other impurities present in the water. </p>
      <p>Each of the above described mixtures was then tested in a 4
        cylinder, 2.5 liter internal combustion engine equipped with
        injectors, which were attached to a fuel rail. The fuel used
        during those tests was disbursed to the fuel rail through a
        Bosch multi-port pressure measuring device. The engine was also
        equipped with a fuel carburetor. The carburetor is only used for
        the air intake into the engine as the air/fuel ratios are
        substantially lower and differ with the various fuels used; for
        example, starting at 0.75:1 with the 50/50 water/alcohol mixture
        and from 1:1 to 3:1 for the 70% water/30% gasoline mixture.
        Normally, a gasoline engine using gasoline as fuel utilizes an
        air fuel ratio of 14 to 1. Such an engine is equipped with a
        cylinder but is changed to accept two 1/2 inch diameter nickel
        bolts or screws, as the hydrogen-producing catalyst, with the
        screw part being of 1/4 inch diameter to practice the invention.
        The nickel bolts were placed 1/2 inch apart on top of the
        piston. In another modification I placed a flat piece of
        aluminum (6-inches by 12-inches) inside and on top of the engine
        head. I drilled and tapped three 3/4 inch holes into the cover
        of the engine head in a horizontal position approximately 3 1/2
        inches apart. I screwed some copper adapters into those holes.
        The adapters are connected with each other by a 3/4 inch copper
        pipe which was fitted into the muffler. This device carries the
        exhaust gas from the engine and I have found that it is
        sufficient to take out water vapors (steam) from the head,
        otherwise the water vapor will accumulate in the engine and
        crankcase oil, which is not desirable. </p>
      <p>Each of the above mentioned fuel mixtures where tested while
        the engine was in neutral so as not to move the car and were
        found to be capable of self starting the engine by just turning
        the ignition key of the car. It was not necessary to use a
        secondary fuel to start the engine. </p>
      <p>The 2.5 liter engine utilized in those tests was in a standard
        2.5 liter Chrysler turbo injection engine with the turbo and all
        smog and pollution abatement equipment removed. This engine also
        had a factory installed 3-speed automatic transmission with a
        gear ratio of 1:3.09. </p>
      <p>The same test series as mentioned above was also performed
        utilizing the same internal combustion engine and car, with
        approximately from 20% to 25% diesel and 75% to 80% water, with
        the same results. Additional tests were conducted with from 20%
        to 25% kerosene fuel and from 75% to 80% water where like
        results were also obtained. </p>
      <p>In another test series, I used a 70% water/30% gasoline
        emulsified mixture as the only fuel to power the engine in a
        test "City Car", which I developed for testing purposes. This
        car is a 4 door, 5 passenger front wheel drive car with a net
        weight of 2,500 pounds. In tests I was able to drive this car
        with the above mentioned fuels from 0 to 60 miles per hour in
        about 6 seconds. I tested the car to a top speed of 75 miles per
        hour but the car could be driven substantially faster. </p>
      <p>As discussed above, I have also determined that it is important
        to control the air to fuel mixture to obtain optimum results. In
        one test, I ran a 14:1 air fuel ratio, the same as
        conventionally used with gasoline, and this resulted in an
        incomplete combustion within the engine and large amount of
        water and fuel mixture exiting the tail pipe. The same occurred
        using an air to fuel mixture of 7:1. These tests were conducted
        using water and gasoline at a 70% to 30% mixture, water and
        diesel at a 75% to 25% mixture and water and kerosene at a 75%
        to 25% mixture. The incomplete combustion began to subside to
        satisfactory levels with air to fuel ratios of 3:1 or less.
        Outer limits and optimum properties are easily determined for
        any given aqueous fuel mixture using the procedure described
        above but the air to fuel ratio should not exceed 5:1. </p>
      <p>I have also found that a wetting agent or surfactant may be
        desirable. One such agent which has proved to be useful has a
        trade name of Aqua-mate2 manufactured or distributed by Hydrotex
        in Dallas, Texas. Obviously, other wetting agents available
        commercially that help disperse carbonaceous fuels in water are
        also usable. </p>
      <p>I additionally conducted tests on all three above described
        fuels using 50% water and 50% carbonaceous fuel, e.g., oil based
        fuel, which was adequately dispersed in the water. These tests
        also allowed the engine to run very satisfactorily. </p>
      <p>Another car test is in progress using 50% water and 50%
        alcohol, with an energy content of 35,000 BTU's per gallon. Test
        results of 20 miles per gallon of actual driving have been
        achieved. With proper fuel management in the engine, efficiency
        can be effectively increased significantly upwards to 30 miles
        per gallon or more. </p>
      <p>The benefits of the invention are substantial since about a 70%
        reduction of air pollutants is obtained with a total elimination
        of NOX. There is also a 70% reduction of the fuel price to drive
        a vehicle through reduction in the amount of gasoline used.
        Furthermore, there are other substantial advantages; such as
        possible reduction of elimination of need for oil imports. </p>
      <p>Other gaseous or liquid carbonaceous fuels may be used,
        including gaseous fuels such as methane, ethane, butane or
        natural gas and the like which could be liquified and
        substituted for ethanol and methanol as used in the present
        invention, or used in gaseous form. </p>
      <p>The present invention could also be used in jet engines, which
        is another form of internal combustion engine. </p>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Crude oil fractions, fossil fuels, and organic
        liquids in general in which it is desirable to reduce the levels
        of fused-ring compounds, aromatics, and olefins are combined
        with an aqueous phase to form an emulsion and treated with
        ultrasound with the effect of opening rings in the fused-ring
        compounds, saturating aromatics, and converting the olefins to
        paraffins. In fossil fuels and crude oil fractions, the process
        raises the API gravity, and in diesel fuels, the process raises
        the cetane index and thereby improves performance. In fuels and
        fractions with sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing
        components, the process reduces the level of these compounds.
        The process can be performed both with and without the added
        presence of hydrogen peroxide. The invention is performed either

        <b>Abstract:</b> An aqueous fuel for an internal combustion
        engine is provided. The fuel comprises water from about 20
        percent to about 80 percent by volume of the total volume of
        said fuel, and a carbonaceous fuel selected from the class
        consisting of ethanol, methanol, gasoline, kerosene fuel, diesel
        fuel, carbon-containing gaseous or liquid fuel, or mixtures
        thereof. A method for combusting an aqueous fuel in an internal
        combustion engine is provided. The method produces approximately
        as much power as the same volume of gasoline. The method
        comprises introducing air and aqueous fuel into a fuel
        introduction system for the engine. The fuel comprises water
        from about 20 percent to about 80 percent by volume of the total
        volume of the fuel, and a carbonaceous fuel from ethanol,
        methanol, gasoline, kerosene fuel, diesel fuel,
        carbon-containing gaseous or liquid fuel, or mixtures thereof,
        and introducing and combusting said air/fuel mixture in a
        combustion chamber or chambers in the presence of a hydrogen
        producing catalyst to operate the engine. </p>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Ultrasound for use in chemical reactions is
        generated by an electromagnet formed from an ultrasound
        transducer whose central feature is a loop of magnetostrictive
        material wound with coils oriented to produce an oscillating
        magnetostrictive force when an oscillating voltage is applied.
        The oscillations in the transducer loop are transmitted to an
        ultrasonic horn that is immersed in a reaction medium where the
        ultrasonic vibrations are transmitted directly to the reaction
        mixture. </p>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Liquids are treated by ultrasound in a
        flow-through reaction vessel with an elongate ultrasonic horn
        mounted to the vessel with one end of the horn extending into
        the vessel interior. The liquid flow path inside the vessel is
        such that the entering liquid strikes the end of the horn at a
        direction normal to the end, then flows across the surface of
        the end before leaving the vessel. The end surface of the horn
        is positioned in close proximity to the entry port to provide a
        relatively high surface-to-volume ratio in the immediate
        vicinity of the horn end. In a further improvement, the horn is
        joined to an ultrasonic transducer through a booster block that
        provides an acoustic gain to the ultrasonic vibrations, and the
        booster block is plated with a reflective metal to lessen any
        loss of ultrasonic energy being transmitted to the horn. </p>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Petroleum residua are combined with water or an
        aqueous solution to form an emulsion which is then treated with
        ultrasound at a sufficient intensity and for a sufficient period
        of time to cause a conversion of the heavy hydrocarbon
        components of the residua to lighter components, thereby
        shifting the entire boiling point curve to lower boiling points.
        This allows one to draw a greater proportion of usable oil from
        the residua. </p>
