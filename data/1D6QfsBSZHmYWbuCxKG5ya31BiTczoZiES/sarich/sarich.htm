      <p><b><i>Invention Intelligence</i> (July 1978)</b> </p>
      <p>Ralph Sarich, inventor of an orbital internal combustion
        engine, has no developed a simple, low cost direct petrol
        injector for automobile engines.Called the orbital injector, the
        new device does nto require high precision manufacture -- which
        is the main reason for the high produciton cost of conventional
        fuel injectors. </p>
      <p>"The orbital injection metering prototypes are being built in
        simple machine tools -- for example, 100 times less stringent in
        manufacturing accuracy and 30 times less demanding in relation
        to surface finish than currently available commercial systems:,
        Mr Sarich said. "This means that the proportional manufacturing
        time of current fuel injector is at least 56 times higher than
        the Orbital's and, therefore, significantly more expensive." </p>
      <p>Mr Sarich claims that the Orbital injector atomizes fuel more
        effectively than systems used in existing motor cars.
        Atomization of fuel is an extremely critical factor in engine
        performance. </p>
      <p>Mr Sarich came up with the direct fuel injector while looking
        for a solution to problems in the orbital engine which he is
        still developing. He had been seeking a method to reduce fuel
        wastage due to quenching adn distribution, which increased the
        carbon emissions. </p>
      <p>The new fuel injector is not yet in commercial production.
        Discussions were to be held with major manufacturers of fuel
        injection systems to weigh up the commercial potential of the
        Orbital injector system. </p>
      <p>It is expected that two-stroke as well as four-stroke engines
        will gain subtantial benefits from the orbital system because of
        its capability of injecting suitably atomized fuel into the
        cylinder after the exhaust port is closed. Normally, a
        considerable loss of fuel into the exhaust occurs during the
        fuel/air induction cycle of operation. </p>
      <p>Prof Robert Brown, hed of Mechanical Engineering at the
        University of Western Australia, has acclaimed Mr Sarich's
        direct petrol injector. He says Mr Sarich's system has overcome
        the problems of precision engineering until now associated with
        fuel injection systems. "As with may good innovations, this new
        development is essentially very simple and one is left asking
        the question: Why was it not developed previously?", Prof Brown
        said. </p>
      <p>Mr Sarich is aware that he has developed his direct petrol
        injector at an opportune time. An estimated 3 million petrol
        injector systems are expected to be sold in the united States
        alone in 1983. </p>
      <p>But he is chiefly pleased because his innovation represents
        another step towards developing his orbital engine to the point
        where it could be commercially exploited. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A method of injecting liquid fuel to
        an engine which includes delivering a quantity of fuel into a
        conduit and propelling the fuel along the conduit by a pulse of
        gas under sufficient pressure to discharge the fuel from an open
        nozzle into an engine induction passage, or combustion chamber.
        The pressure and quantity of gas are preferably sufficient to
        cause the fuel to issue from the nozzle at or near sonic speed.
        The duration of the pulse of gas may be varied with a variation
        in the quantity of fuel to improve the fuel metering accuracy
        with engine load changes. </p>
      <p><b>THE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the delivery of measured quantities
        of liquid fuel into the induction passage of an internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>The various fuel injection systems currently in use, in
        internal combustion engines, operate on the basis of a column of
        liquid between the point of application of the injection force
        to the fuel and the delivery nozzle. These systems rely on the
        adding of a metered quantity of fuel to the upstream end of the
        column to displace an equal quantity of fuel from the nozzle at
        the downstream end of the column. In order to achieve the
        required accuracy in the quantity of fuel delivered from the
        nozzle, the column of fuel must be free of gas, due to its
        compressible nature. </p>
      <p>It is also necessary for the nozzle to be selectively opened
        and closed to maintain the gas-free state of the column of fuel
        between successive deliveries, or to ensure sufficient delivery
        pressure for continuous systems, to maintain the gas-free state
        of the fuel line. </p>
      <p>These selectively openable nozzles are required to be high
        precision components in order to maintain metering integrity
        and/or consistent spray characteristics. Hence, manufacturing
        cost is high and susceptibility to fouling by foreign materials
        in the fuel is prevalent. Additionally durability is a potential
        problem due to the frequency of opening of the nozzle for either
        a pulsed or continuous metering system. (In the latter case, the
        natural vibrational frequency of a spring-loaded nozzle is
        excited even though output is nominally continuous.) </p>
      <p>U.K. Patent No. 2,023,226 involves continuous injection of a
        fuel/air mixture into the inlet manifold of an internal
        combustion engine. Compressed air and fuel are delivered
        separately to a mixing chamber immediately adjacent the
        injection nozzle, and the pressure in the mixing chamber
        actuates the valve in the nozzle to effect injection of the
        fuel/air mixture to the engine. The mixing chamber in the nozzle
        incorporates a porous sintered element, but it is believed this
        feature does not contribute significantly to proper atomization
        of the fuel. The required atomization is apparently achieved by
        the pressure drop through the valve, and the consequent sonic
        velocity. This injection system does not employ a constantly
        open injection nozzle, nor is the fuel conveyed to the nozzle by
        individual shots of air. </p>
      <p>German Patent No. 314,252 employs a constantly open nozzle and
        high pressure air to effect injection of fuel through the
        nozzle. A fuel dispensing surface (grid) is provided between a
        fuel storage chamber and the delivery nozzle, to assist
        atomization of the fuel. The disclosure relates to injectors for
        diesel engines, and it is not disclosed that the high pressure
        air contributes to atomization of the fuel. </p>
      <p>Australian Patent No. 237,354 discloses an injection system
        wherein a constant supply of fuel is delivered to a constantly
        open nozzle as a continuous flow. There is no air associated
        with the conveying of the fuel to the respective nozzles, or the
        delivery of the fuel from these nozzles. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide
        a method of injecting metered quantities of fuel into an engine
        induction passage, that at least, reduces the above referred to
        problems in currently known methods. </p>
      <p>With this object in view there is provided a method of
        delivering liquid fuel to an internal combustion engine
        comprising delivering a pre-determined quantity of liquid fuel
        into a conduit, admitting a gas to the conduit upstream of the
        quantity of fuel at a pressure and for a period sufficient to
        propel the quantity of fuel through the conduit and discharge
        the fuel through a fixed size constantly open nozzle at the
        downstream end of the conduit. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, by this method each measured quantity of fuel is
        transported through the conduit and delivered from the nozzle
        independently, avoiding the necessity of maintaining the conduit
        full of fuel and free of gas, as required in the currently used
        systems. </p>
      <p>It has been found that if the gas pressure and nozzle design is
        selected so the air issues therefrom at or near sonic speed, a
        high degree of atomization of the fuel can be achieved. </p>
      <p>Preferably the conduit is selected so that the frictional drag
        between the fuel and the internal surface of the conduit will
        result in at least a portion of the fuel forming an emulsion
        with the propelling gas, during passage through the conduit.
        This emulsion is characterized by a high surface area to volume
        ratio. </p>
      <p>The motion of the liquid fuel through the conduit will be
        resisted by shear stresses at the conduit walls, and under the
        action of these stresses, the inner core of liquid fuel will
        progress faster than that fuel at the walls. The velocity of the
        gas being faster than the liquid fuel at the walls creates shear
        stresses over the liquid surface, breaking off droplets and
        entraining them in the gas flow creating the mixture of gas and
        liquid fuel. </p>
      <p>The variables of gas pressure, conduit length and conduit
        diameter may be varied within respective ranges to achieve the
        desired mixing of the fuel and air. However, the provision of a
        minimum gas dose relative to the quantity of fuel makes the
        determination of conduit diameter, one of ensuring the smallest
        diameter which will pass the gas and fuel in the time available.
        In this way the maximum surface to volume ratio is obtained and
        hence maximum break-up of droplets. Empirical tests define a
        satisfactory minimum gas dose. </p>
      <p>Preferably the nozzle is of a construction that creates a film
        of fuel immediately prior to discharge from the nozzle, at least
        in the lower portion of the range of discharge rates encountered
        during operation, that is then broken up into fine droplets
        prior to issuing from the nozzle. The breaking up is largely
        achieved by the movement of the propelling gas past a surface in
        the nozzle, which surface is in use, wetted by a film of fuel.
        This may be effected by providing, in the path of the fuel, a
        surface that diverges in the direction of movement of the fuel
        through the nozzle. Conveniently, the surface is generally
        conical and leads to an annular discharge port in the nozzle. </p>
      <p>The creating of the film of fuel has the effect of increasing
        the surface area of fuel in contact with the propelling gas to
        assist atomization. When handling quantities of fuel in the
        lower portion of the nozzle range, the film of fuel will not
        fully occupy the passage through the nozzle and therefore
        portion of the propelling gas will flow over the exposed surface
        of the fuel film. The shear stresses created on the surface of
        the film will break off droplets of fuel to further promote
        atomization of the fuel. </p>
      <p>The fuel film is created by virtue of the change of direction
        of movement of the fuel by the presence of the divergent
        surface, which for convenience is frusto-conical and terminates
        in an annular delivery opening. The fuel with its implicit
        inertia will impinge on the cone surface and will spread
        thereover by virtue of its tendency to continue to travel in its
        initial trajectory before meeting the surface. </p>
      <p>As a guide to the surface area to be provided on the cone, the
        area is normally made sufficient to allow approximately half of
        the normal fuel pulse dose to be resident thereon, assuming a
        film thickness equal to the width of the annular delivery
        opening. The final design may be empirically determined to
        optimise the nozzle shape. </p>

      </center>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows one design of a nozzle having a frusto-conical
        film forming surface and an annular delivery opening. The nozzle
        body 5 is adapted at one end 6 to be coupled to a flexible fuel
        line. At the other end the body has an internal tapered bore 7
        communicating with the passage 8 extending from the one end 6 of
        the body. The deflector member 9 is mounted in the bore 7 and
        has an external tapered surface 10. The angle of the tapered
        bore 7 is less than the angle of the surface 10 so that the
        annular passage 11 formed therebetween is tapered towards the
        annular delivery opening 12. </p>
      <p>In one specific construction of the nozzle the taper of the
        bore 7 is 6.degree. and the taper of the external surface 10 is
        8.degree.. The width of the annular opening is in the range of
        0.1 to 0.15 mm at the exit. The axial length of the annular
        passage formed between the tapered surfaces is 10 to 12 mm. </p>
      <p>As can be seen in FIG. 2, a section view along the line 2--2 in
        FIG. 1, the shank 4 of the deflector member 9 is received in a
        central bore 3 with four bores 2 spaced thereabout to provide
        paths for the flow of fuel and gas to the nozzle. The bores 2
        intersect the central bore 3 and the shank 4 is a press fit with
        the lands formed by the intersecting bores 2 and 3. </p>
      <p>In an alternate construction as shown in FIG. 3, the nozzle has
        a parallel bore 15 of approximately 1.5 mm diameter and 1.0 to
        2.0 mm long. This bore opens at the forward end into a co-axial
        expansion chamber 16 of a diameter of 6.0 mm and a length of 5.0
        mm. The face 17 of the chamber through which the bore enters is
        in a plane at right angles to the bore and chamber axis. The
        high rate of expansion produced by the high velocity air and
        fuel issuing from the bore 15 into the chamber, produces fine
        atomization of the fuel. </p>
      <p>In use it has been found that each of the nozzles illustrated
        achieve improved atomization if the gas speed at the exit from
        the annular opening 11 (FIG. 1) or bore 15 (FIG. 3) is sonic or
        of that order. This speed can be achieved if the pressure drop
        across the nozzle opening is of 1 BAR or more. </p>
      <p>The measured quantity of fuel may be measured and delivered
        into the conduit for delivery to either of the nozzles shown in
        FIGS. 1 and 3, by the metering apparatus disclosed in the
        applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945, the disclosure in which is
        hereby incorporated herein by reference, and hereinafter
        described with reference to FIGS. 4 to 7 of the accompanying
        drawings. </p>
      <p>The metering apparatus comprises a body 110, having
        incorporated therein six individual metering units 111 arranged
        in side by side parallel relationship. The nipples 112 and 113
        are adapted for connection to a fuel supply line and a fuel
        return line respectively, and communicate with respective fuel
        supply and return galleries 60 and 70 provided within the block
        110 for the supply and return of fuel from each of the metering
        units 111. Each metering unit 111 is provided with an individual
        fuel delivery nipple 114 to which a line may be connected to
        communicate the metering unit with the injection nozzle. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows the metering rod 115 extending into the air supply
        chamber 119 and metering chamber 120. Each of the six metering
        rods 115 pass through the common leakage collection chamber 116
        which is formed by a cavity 116 provided in the body 110 and the
        coverplate 121 attached in sealted relation to the body 110. The
        function and operation of the leakage collection chamber is no
        part of this invention and is described in greater detail in
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945. </p>
      <p>Each metering rod 115 is hollow and is axially slidable in the
        body 110 and the extent of projection of the metering rod into
        the metering chamber 120 may be varied to adjust the quantity of
        fuel displacable from the metering chamber. The valve 143 is at
        that end of the metering rod located in the metering chamber, is
        supported on the rod 143a and is normally held closed by the
        spring 145, located between the upper end of the hollow rod 115
        and valve rod 143a, to prevent the flow of air through the
        hollow bore of the metering rod 115 from the air supply chamber
        119 to the metering chamber 120. Upon the pressure in the
        chamber 119 rising to a predetermined value the valve 143 is
        opened so air will flow from chamber 119 to the metering chamber
        through hollow rod 115, and thus displace the fuel therefrom.
        The quantity of fuel displaced by the air is the fuel located in
        the chamber 120 between the point of entry of the air to the
        chamber, and the point of discharge of the fuel from the
        chamber, that is the quantity of fuel between the air admission
        valve 143 and the delivery valve 109. </p>
      <p>Each of the metering rods 115 are coupled to the crosshead 161,
        and the crosshead is coupled to the actuator rod 160 which is
        slidably supported in the body 110. The actuator rod 160 is
        coupled to the motor 169, which is controlled in response to the
        engine fuel demand, to adjust the extent of projection of the
        metering rods into the metering chambers 120, and hence the
        position of the air admission valve 143 so the metered quantity
        of fuel delivered by the admission of the air is in accordance
        with the fuel demand. </p>
      <p>The fuel delivery nipples each incorporate a pressure actuated
        delivery valve 109 which opens in response to the pressure in
        the metering chamber 120 when the air is admitted thereto from
        the air supply chamber 119. Upon the air entering the metering
        chamber through the valve 143 the delivery valve 109 also opens
        and the air will move towards the delivery valve displacing the
        fuel from the metering chamber through the delivery valve. The
        valve 143 is maintained open until sufficient air has been
        supplied to displace the fuel between the valve 143 and 109 from
        the chamber along the delivery line 108 and through the nozzle
        18, which is preferably a nozzle as described with reference to
        FIGS. 1 and 2 or 3. </p>
      <p>Each metering chamber 120 has a respective fuel inlet port 125
        and a fuel outlet port 126 controlled by respective valves 127
        and 128 to permit circulation of fuel from the inlet gallery 60
        through the chamber 120 to the outlet gallery 70. Each of the
        valves 127 and 128 are connected to the respective diaphragms
        129 and 130. The valves 127 and 128 are spring-loaded to an open
        position, and are closed in response to the application of air
        under pressure to the respective diaphragms 129 and 130 via the
        diaphragm cavities 131 and 132. Each of the diaphragm cavities
        are in constant communication with the air conduit 133, and the
        conduit 133 is also in constant communication with the air
        supply chamber 119 by the conduit 135. Thus, when air under
        pressure is admitted to the air supply chamber 119 and hence to
        the metering chamber 120 to effect delivery of fuel, the air
        also acts on the diaphragms 129 and 130 to cause the valves 127
        and 128 to close the fuel inlet and outlet ports 125 and 126. </p>
      <p>The control of the supply of air to the chamber 119 through
        conduit 135 to the diaphragm cavities 131 and 132 through
        conduit 133 is controlled in time relation with the cycling of
        the engine therefor the solenoid operated valve 150. The common
        air supply conduit 151, connected to a compressed air supply via
        nipple 153, runs through the body with respective branches 152
        providing air to the solenoid valve of each metering unit. </p>
      <p>Normally the spherical valve element 159 is positioned by the
        springs 160 to prevent the flow of air from conduit 151 to
        conduit 135. When the solenoid is energised the force of the
        springs 160 is released from the valve element 159 which is
        displaced by the pressure of the air supply so air will flow
        from conduit 151 to conduit 135 and 133. </p>
      <p>The operation of the solenoid valve 150 may also be controlled
        to vary the duration of the period that air is supplied to the
        air chamber 119 and cavities 131 and 132, to ensure the fuel
        displaced from the metering chamber is delivered through the
        nozzle 18. </p>
      <p>The admission of the air to the metering chamber may be
        controlled by an electronic processor, activated by signals from
        the engine that sense the fuel demand of the engine. The
        processor may be programmed to vary the frequency and duration
        of admission of the air to the metering chamber. </p>
      <p>Full details of the operation of the metering apparatus can be
        obtained from applicants U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945 previously
        referred to herein. </p>
      <p>The quantity of air used to propel each measured quantity of
        fuel is conveniently the same for all quantities of fuel within
        the range required for a particular engine. The use of a
        constant quantity of air simplifies the construction of the
        metering apparatus and the control equipment used therewith. </p>
      <p>In applying the present invention to a four cylinder 1600 cc
        capacity engine 4,000 mm.sup.3 of air measured at S.T.P. per
        metered pulse to each cylinder is used throughout the full range
        of fuel supply which ranges from 4 to 80 mm.sup.3 per metered
        pulse. These volumes correspond to a 4 mg of air with 3 to 60 mg
        of fuel per injection. Under normal operating conditions, the
        amount of fuel may range from 5 to 30 mg per injection. It is
        considered preferable for the volumetric ratio of gas to fuel
        (volume at S.T.P.) be at least 50 to 1. If the ratio is
        significantly less than 50:1 it has been found that there is a
        delay in the response of the engine to changes in the metered
        quantity of fuel delivered. </p>
      <p>It is believed that a high ratio of air to fuel reduces the
        amount of fuel that is left as a residue on the conduit and
        nozzle walls. The greater the amount of air passing through the
        conduit after each metered quantity of fuel, the less is the
        amount of fuel remaining on the wall of the conduit. </p>
      <p>It is also believed that fuel stripped from the wall of the
        conduit by the continuing flow of air, after the delivery of the
        main portion of the fuel, is more finely atomized and thus
        improved combustion efficiency. </p>
      <p>It is therefore advantageous to use a volumetric air to fuel
        ratio substantially greater than 50:1, and, from a performance
        point of view only, it would be preferable to increase the ratio
        of air to fuel. This can be achieved by the use of suitable
        control equipment that varies the period that air is admitted to
        the conduit as the fuel quantities increase. Also it is
        desirable to increase the period that air is admitted during the
        starting of the engine because of the improved atomisation
        achieved with the greater quantity of air. </p>
      <p>It has been found experimentally that incorporating the present
        invention in a fuel injection system for a 1600 cc capacity four
        cylinder engine and injecting methanol as fuel at a volumetric
        air-fuel ratio of 50:1 gives a measured spray from an injector
        nozzle as illustrated in FIG. 1 of 20 microns (Sauter) mean
        droplet diameter, and with a volumetric air-fuel ratio of 400:1
        gives a mean diameter of 5 microns. This is of an order of
        magnitude finer than existing systems and it will be appreciated
        that the finer atomisation gives benefits in many ways to an
        engine's operation. </p>
      <p>As an example, the above conditions would allow better cold
        starting of an engine running on 100% methanol, a capability
        unmatched by existing injection systems. </p>
      <p>In the above description the propelling gas has been referred
        to as air, however the use of air is not essential for the
        operation of the invention. In practice it is proposed to use a
        fuel-air mixture to propel the fuel, the proportions of fuel and
        air effectively being unimportant. Further details of the use of
        the fuel-air gas mixture are disclosed in the applicant's U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,519,356 based on Australian Patent Application No. PF
        2126/81 and hereinbefore referred to. </p>
      <p>As disclosed in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945, FIG. 6
        represents an enlarged sectional view of metering rod 115. The
        rod is formed from a tubular member 640 having a valve seat
        insert 641 in the lower end and a spring seat insert 642 in the
        supper end. The valve element 643 is carried by the valve stem
        644 which extends axially through the tubular member 640. The
        spring 145 is located within the upper end of the tubular member
        640 about the stem 644, and co-operates with the second spring
        seat 646 attached to the end of the stem 644. Diametrically
        opposite openings 647 are provided in the wall of the tubular
        member 640 so as to provide a free communication between the air
        supply chamber 119 and the interior of the tubular member 640 as
        seen in FIG. 6. The spring element 145 is pre-stressed to
        normally hold a valve element 143 against the seat 641, and upon
        the pressure in the air supply chamber 119 reaching a
        pre-determined pressure, the valve element 143 will be moved
        clear of the valve seat 641 so that air may pass from the air
        supply chamber 119 through the tubular member 640 into the
        metering chamber 120. </p>
      <p>Individual solenoid valves may be provided for each metering
        unit 111 or two or more metering units may be controlled by the
        same solenoid valve depending upon the number of metering units
        incorporated in the body 110 and the timing cycle of the
        cylinders of the engine to which the fuel is being metered. In
        the current embodiment an individual solenoid valve 150 is
        provided for each metering unit. The valve element of the
        solenoid valve 150 is held in position to isolate the air supply
        duct 151 from conduit 135 when the solenoid is activated, and at
        the same time the conduit 135 is connected to the vent 155. When
        the solenoid is de-activated, the pressure of the air in the
        supply duct 151 will move the valve element into a position so
        as to isolate the conduit 135 from the vent 155 and couple the
        air supply duct 151 to the conduit 135. Thus, in this position
        the compressed air is supplied to the diaphragm cavities 131 and
        132. Each of the diaphragm cavities are in constant
        communication with the air conduit 133 and the conduit 133 is
        also in constant communication with the air supply chamber 119
        by the conduit 135. </p>
      <p>The bearings 517 and 518, which slidably support the metering
        rod 115, are not intended to provide a seal against the leakage
        of air or fuel from the air supply or metering chambers.
        Accordingly, the fit between the metering rod 115 and bearings
        517 and 518 may be selected so that frictional resistance to the
        sliding of the metering rod is very low. </p>
      <p>The air and fuel leakage is collected in the chamber 116 and is
        drained therefrom through the conduit 71 into the cavity 472
        which communicates with the fuel return nipple 113. The conduit
        73 provides communication between the diaphragms 129 and 130, on
        the side opposite to the cavities 131 and 132, and the chamber
        116. This allows drainage of fuel that leaks between the stems
        of the valves 127 and 128 and their guides, so as to avoid an
        accumulation of liquid in this area that would prevent correct
        operation of the diaphragms 129 and 130 to close the valves 127
        and 128. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the collection of the fuel leakage
        and the feeding of it to the fuel return nipple and hence
        returned to the fuel supply. This avoids pollution of the
        atmosphere by the leaked fuel, and contributes to the overall
        efficiency of the engine. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, the control of the degree of
        projection of the metering rods 115 into the respective metering
        chambers 120, is regulated by the actuator 160 slidably
        supported in the body 110 parallel to the metering rods 15. The
        actuator rod 160 is connected to each of the metering rods 115
        by the cross-head 161. The cross-head 161 is secured in a fixed
        location on the actuator rod 160 by the set screw 762 and the
        return spring 763 located about the actuator rod 160 is seated
        in the recess 764 in the body and abutts the undersurface of the
        central portion of the cross-head 161. The spring 763 is
        stressed so as to urge the actuator rod 160 to the cross-head
        161, and hence each of the metering rods 115, in an upward
        direction as viewed in FIGS. 4 and 5, to thereby reduce the
        degree of projection of the metering rods 115 into the metering
        chambers 120, and hence increase the quantity of fuel to be
        delivered during each injection cycle. The diaphragm seal 771
        isolates the motor 169 from fuel or fuel vapour that may be
        present in the 116. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of this invention is directed to the metering
        and delivery of fuel to an internal combustion engine, and in
        particular concerns those systems, such as previously described,
        employing a pulse of gas to deliver and/or inject a metered
        quantity of fuel. The invention has particular applicability to
        the fueling of engines for vehicles that experience frequent and
        substantial transient load conditions. </p>
      <p>There is an increasing requirement for less expensive, and more
        fuel efficient, fuel injection systems for internal combustion
        engines. Conventional fuel injection systems have previously
        required a high pressure fuel pump, and high differential
        pressure metering apparatus, in order to achieve an acceptable
        degree of fuel atomisation and hot fuel handling ability. Both
        these requirements result in a high cost of componentry due to
        the high standard of engineering required in production, the
        close tolerances on manufacturing dimensions, and use of
        expensive materials of construction. </p>
      <p>The use of pneumatic fuel metering was described in the SAE
        technical paper 820351 by Mackay, and further details may be
        found in United Kingdom Patent Nos. 2,018,906 and 2,103,501 and
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945. Such use significantly alleviates the
        problems described above. </p>
      <p>In the methods of pneumatic fuel metering and injection
        described in the above documents, a metered quantity of fuel
        located in a chamber is expelled from that chamber by a pulse of
        gas at high pressure for delivery to the engine. Such delivery
        is preferably via flexible tubing to the engine's inlet
        manifold, but may alternatively be delivered directly into the
        combustion chamber. Existing systems operate by providing gas at
        an elevated pressure upstream of a valve at the gas inlet port
        of the chamber, and opening that valve in response to
        instruction from a programmed electronic controller. The period
        of valve opening has previously been maintained constant for all
        metered quantities of fuel to be delivered from the chamber by
        the gas pulse, the system being designed so the period is
        sufficient to deliver the required metered quantity of fuel at
        maximum fuel demand of the engine. The period of valve opening
        was controlled by a constant width pulse from the electronic
        controller. </p>
      <p>However, for acceptable operation of a given engine, the system
        must be able to handle a wide range of fuel quantities. Under
        steady state operation (i.e. constant speed and load) a fuel
        metering and delivery system requires a turn-down ratio of about
        5 to 1, but on abrupt load increases the engine can require, for
        a very short period, up to twice as much fuel than that at wide
        open throttle. </p>
      <p>Current evidence suggests that although a constant gas pulse
        width is sufficient to expel the required amount of fuel from
        the chamber, the quantity of air actually delivered with the
        metered quantity of fuel significantly decreases with increased
        metered fuel quantities. This decrease in air quantity is
        thought to be due to inertia and viscosity effects of the
        increased quantity of fuel, and has a detrimental effect on the
        quantity of fuel actually delivered, the quality of the fuel air
        mixture preparation and spray pattern delivered to the engine. </p>
      <p>It is therefore another object of the present invention to
        provide a method of delivering fuel to an engine by the use of a
        compressed gas which will give improved engine response in
        transient load conditions. </p>
      <p>The present invention therefore further proposes a method of
        delivering fuel to an engine by the admission of compressed gas
        to a chamber to displace a metered quantity of fuel therefrom,
        and varying the mass of gas admitted with variations in the fuel
        demand so that as the fuel demand increases the mass of gas
        increases. </p>
      <p>The increasing of the mass of gas admitted to the chamber to
        displace the metered quantity of fuel, as the quantity of fuel
        increases, results in additional energy per unit weight of fuel
        being available to displace the fuel from the metering chamber
        and transport the fuel to and through the injection nozzle. </p>
      <p>Also the increased mass of gas will assist in the atomisation
        and spray formation of the fuel issuing from the nozzle. Subject
        to the degree of increase in the gas mass relative to the fuel
        quantity, the specific energy remaining in the gas at the nozzle
        may also increase with the increase in fuel quantity, and if not
        increased should at least be maintained substantially constant
        for the major part of the range of fuel quantities within normal
        operating conditions. </p>
      <p>The variation of the gas mass may be in accordance with a
        linear relation to the variation in fuel quantity, or any other
        selected relation. </p>
      <p>The mass of gas delivered to the metering chamber is influenced
        by the pressure and temperature of the gas at entry to the
        metering chamber. However, from practical considerations it is
        not convenient to vary either the pressure or temperature,
        particularly having regard to the requirement of effecting the
        variation in a time interval of a few milliseconds. The most
        convenient means of varying the mass of gas is to vary the time
        period during which the gas is admitted to the metering chamber.
      </p>
      <p>More specifically there is provided a method of delivering fuel
        to an engine comprising establishing a metered quantity of fuel
        in a chamber, said chamber having a gas supply port and a fuel
        delivery port, and displacing the fuel from said chamber through
        said fuel delivery port and delivering the fuel through a nozzle
        to the engine, said displacement and delivery of the fuel being
        effected by admission of gas to the chamber through said gas
        supply port, wherein the mass of gas admitted is varied in
        accordance with the fuel demand of said engine. </p>
      <p>As is known, when a fluid and particularly a liquid flows
        through a conduit a layer of the liquid is formed on the
        internal surface of the conduit. The thickness of the layer is
        dependent on a number of factors including the viscosity of the
        liquid, the velocity of flow, and the surface finish of the
        conduit. As the velocity of the liquid decreases the thickness
        of the layer increases, and thus in the fuel metering systems of
        the type under consideration, if the velocity of the fuel
        delivery decreases the quantity of fuel in the stationary layer
        increases. </p>
      <p>It is therefore seen that if there is an increase in the fuel
        quantity without a corresponding increase in the gas mass
        propelling the fuel, a portion of the increase in fuel quantity
        may not be delivered to the engine, but is consumed in
        increasing the stationary layer. Accordingly, by increasing the
        mass of air propelling the fuel as the fuel quantity is
        increased, a decrease in fuel velocity may be avoided and the
        thickness of the stationary layer remains substantially
        constant. </p>
      <p>It is possible to reduce the thickness of the layer if the
        increase in the air mass is sufficient to increase the velocity
        of the fuel. This can be beneficial in two ways. Increasing the
        gas mass without an increase in the metered quantity of fuel
        will increase the fuel velocity and consequently reduce the
        layer thickness. In this way a limited increase in fuel quantity
        delivered to the nozzle can be achieved without changing the
        actual metered quantity. This manner of increasing fuel supply
        to the engine can be useful where the fuel demand increase is
        relatively small and of short duration. </p>
      <p>Secondly, if the increase in the gas mass is associated with an
        increase in metered quantity of fuel, and is sufficient to
        increase the overall fuel velocity, then a reduction of the fuel
        layer thickness may result, thus further increasing the quantity
        of fuel delivered through the nozzle. This may be used to
        advantage when there is a large or rapid increase in the fuel
        demand. </p>
      <p>The quantity of fuel may be metered upon introduction to the
        chamber, or may be metered by and/or during the course of the
        admission of gas to the chamber. </p>
      <p>This further aspect of the invention is more readily understood
        from the following description with reference to FIGS. 8 to 11
        of the accompanying drawings. In the drawings: </p>

        constructional features and components with the apparatus shown
        in FIGS. 4 to 7 and the same reference numbers are used for
        these common features and components. Refer now to FIG. 8
        comprises a body 110, having incorporated therein four
        individual metering units 111 arranged in side by side
        relationship. This apparatus is thus suitable for use with a
        four cylinder engine, with each metering unit 111 dedicated to a
        separate cylinder. The nipples 112 and 113 are adapted for
        connection to a fuel supply line and a fuel return line
        respectively (not shown), and communicate with respective fuel
        supply and return galleries 60 and 70 provided within the body

        units 111. </p>
      <p>Each metering unit 111 is provided with an individual fuel
        delivery nipple 114 to which is connected a respective metered
        fuel delivery conduit 108 which conducts the individually
        metered quantities of fuel to an injector nozzle 18. The nozzle
        is located at a suitable position to deliver the fuel to the
        engine, such as inserted in the inlet manifold of the engine
        near the respective cylinder air inlet valve. Further details of
        the apparatus are given in our abovementioned U.S. patent
        application No. 4,554,945. </p>
      <p>The body 110 is preferably positioned close to the injector
        nozzle 18, and the metered fuel delivery conduits 108 are
        suitable tubing of approximately 1.8 mm diameter, and from 10 to
        40 cm in length varying with the distance to each cylinder. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows in section one metering unit 111, having a
        metering rod 115 extending into both the air supply chamber 119
        and metering chamber 120. Each of the four metering rods 115
        pass through the common leakage collection chamber 116, which is
        formed by a cavity provided in the body 110 and the coverplate
        121 attached in sealed relation to the body 110. The function
        and operation of the leakage collection chamber 116 is no part
        of this invention and is described in greater detail in the
        abovementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,945. </p>
      <p>Each metering rod 115 is hollow, and is axially slidable in the
        body 110, the extent of projection of the metering rod into the
        metering chamber 120 being varied to adjust the quantity of fuel
        displacable from the metering chamber 120. The valve 143, at
        that end of the metering rod located in the metering chamber
        120, is supported by the rod 143a and normally held closed by
        the spring 145, located between the upper end of the hollow rod
        115 and valve rod 143a. The flow of air through the hollow bore
        of the metering rod 115 from the air supply chamber 119 to the
        metering chamber 120 is controlled by the valve 143. Upon the
        pressure in the air supply chamber 119 rising to a predetermined
        value the valve 143 is opened to permit air to flow from the air
        supply chamber 119 to the metering chamber 120 through hollow
        rod 115, to displace the fuel from the metering chamber 120. </p>
      <p>The quantity of fuel displaced by the air is that fuel located
        in the metering chamber 120 between the point of entry of the
        air to the metering chamber, and the point of discharge of fuel
        between the air admission valve 143 and the delivery valve 109
        at the opposite end of the metering chamber 120. </p>
      <p>Each of the metering rods 115 are coupled to the crosshead 161,
        as shown in more detail in FIG. 7, and the crosshead is coupled
        to the actuator rod 160 which is slidably supported in the body
        110. The actuator rod 160 is coupled to the motor 169, which is
        controlled in response to the engine fuel demand, to adjust the
        extent of projection of the metering rods 115 into the metering
        chambers 120, and hence the position of the air admission valves
        143 so, the metered quantity of fuel delivered by the admission
        of the air is in accordance with the fuel demand. The motor 169
        may be a reversible linear type stepper motor such as the 92100
        series marketed by Airpax Corp. </p>
      <p>The fuel delivery valves 109 are each pressure actuated to open
        in response to the pressure in the metering chamber 120, when
        the air is admitted thereto from the air supply chamber 119.
        Upon the air entering the metering chamber 120 through the valve
        143, the delivery valve 109 also opens, and the air will move
        towards the delivery valve displacing fuel from the metering
        chamber through the delivery valve. The air admission valve 143
        is maintained open until sufficient air has been supplied to
        displace the fuel between the valve 143 and 109 from the
        chamber, and to provide additional air to transfer the fuel
        through the conduit 108 to the nozzle 18, and to atomisation the
        fuel as it is delivered through the nozzle. </p>
      <p>Each metering chamber 120 has a respective fuel inlet port 125
        and a fuel outlet port 126 controlled by respective valves 127
        and 128 to permit circulation of fuel from the inlet gallery 60,
        through the metering chamber 120, to the outlet gallery 70. Each
        of the valves 127 and 128 are connected to the respective
        diaphragms 129 and 130. The valves 127 and 128 are spring-loaded
        to an open position, and are closed in response to the
        application of air under pressure to the respective diaphragms
        129 and 130 via the diaphragm cavities 131 and 132. Each of the
        diaphragm cavities are in constant communication with the air
        conduit 133, and the conduit 133 is in constant communication
        with the air supply chamber 119 by the conduit 135. </p>
      <p>Thus, when air under pressure is admitted to the air supply
        chamber 119 and hence to the metering chamber 120 to effect
        delivery of fuel, the air also acts on the diaphragms 129 and
        130 to cause the valves 127 and 128 to close the fuel inlet and
        outlet ports 125 and 126. </p>
      <p>The control of the supply of air to the chamber 119 through
        conduit 135, and to the diaphragm cavities 131 and 132 through
        conduit 133, is regulated in time relation with the cycling of
        the engine by the solenoid operated valve 150. The common air
        supply conduit 151, connectable to a compressed air supply via
        nipple 153, runs through the body 110 with respective branches
        152 providing air to the respective solenoid valve 150 of each
        metering unit 111. </p>
      <p>Normally the spherical valve element 159 is positioned, under
        action from springs 170, to prevent the flow of air from conduit
        151 to conduit 135, and to vent conduit 135 to atmospheric via
        vent port 161. When the solenoid is energised the force of the
        spring 170 acting on the valve element 159 is relieved, and the
        valve element is displaced by the pressure on the air supply to
        permit air to flow from conduit 151 to conduits 135 and 133. </p>
      <p>The timing of the energizing of the solenoid 150 in relation to
        the engine cycle may be controlled by a suitable sensing device
        activated by a rotating component of the engine, such as the
        crankshaft or flywheel or any other component driven at a speed
        directly related to engine speed. A sensor suitable for this
        purpose is an optical switch including an infra-red source and a
        photo detector with Schmitt trigger. </p>
      <p>Previously it has been proposed that the duration of
        energization of the solenoid 150 be a fixed period, independent
        of fuel quantity to be delivered and engine speed. This fixed
        period was selected to suit the maximum fuel demand when the
        engine is operating at maximum engine speed. </p>
      <p>The most convenient manner of controlling the operation of the
        solenoid 150 is an electronic controller, which provides a pulse
        of electrical energy of fixed duration to the solenoid
        irrespective of the engine fueling requirements. However, in
        using that form control in practice, it has been found that the
        actual quantity of air passed with the fuel through the injector
        nozzle 18 per fuel delivery tends to reduce with increasing fuel
        delivery levels. </p>
      <p>This is believed to be due to changes in inertia and viscosity
        effects arising with the increased fuel level. This can be
        compensated for by the present invention by increasing the
        length of time the electrical energy is applied to the solenoid
        150 at the higher fuelling levels, thus increasing the time
        during which gas enters the metering chamber 120 and so
        increasing the mass of air available to pass along the fuel
        conduit and through the delivery nozzle. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 is a logic diagram representing a typical mode of
        operation of the electronic controller 192 (FIG. 8) to effect
        variation of the period that the solenoid 150 is energised in
        proportion to the metered quantity of fuel to be delivered to
        meet the engine fuel demand. The controller 192 is programmed
        with the required relationship between metered fuel quantity and
        air mass per injection cycle. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 8 the actuator rod 160 carries a wiper arm 190
        which co-operates with a stationary resistance strip 191 mounted
        in the body 110. The wiper and resistance strip forming a feed
        back potentiometer 198. The actuator rod 160 is coupled to the
        metering rods 111 and varies the extent of projection of the
        metering rods into the metering chambers 120, and hence varies
        the metered quantity of fuel delivered. Accordingly, the
        position of the wiper arm 190 on the resistance strip 191 and
        hence the output of the feed-back potentiometer is directly
        proportional to the metered quantity of fuel being delivered. </p>
      <p>The electronic controller 192 is programmed to receive at a
        regular interval of voltage reading from the potentiometer 198
        and thereby determine the position of the actuator rod 160 and
        hence the size of the metered quantity of fuel. The readings
        from the resistor are conveniently made at half milli-second
        intervals. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIG. 9, having received the voltage reading
        from the potentiometer the controller 192 determines the period
        of energization of the solenoid 150 required for the metered
        quantity of fuel corresponding to the position of the actuator
        rod 160. If at the time of the controller making the
        determination the engine is in that part of the engine cycle
        when fuel is being delivered, then the controller will make an
        adjustment to the remaining period of energization. If as a
        result of this adjustment the period of energization is reduced
        to zero, then the controller will switch off the solenoid
        energizing channel so that delivery of fuel and gas will cease.
        However, if the remaining period is not reduced to zero then the
        solenoid will continue to be energized and fuel and gas will
        continue to be delivered. At the next half milli-second period
        the sequence is repeated. </p>
      <p>Reverting to the determination of the period of energizing of
        the solenoid, if at that time the engine is not in that part of
        its cycle when fuel is to be delivered, the newly determined
        period of energization is stored. If within the then current
        half milli-second interval the engine enters the part of its
        cycle when fuel is to be delivered, then the solenoid will be
        energized for the newly determined period. In the event that the
        engine does not enter the part of its cycle for the delivery of
        fuel during the half milli-second interval, then at the end of
        that period the sequence is repeated as above explained. </p>
      <p>Commercially available componentry can be arranged and
        programmed to perform the functions required to fulfill the
        above discussed logic diagram. Also other factors may be
        introduced to vary the period that the solenoid is energized. In
        automotive applications one factor that may be taken into
        account is the voltage of the electrical energy source to
        operate the solenoid. </p>
      <p>The voltage of the battery provided in an automobile may vary
        significantly under operating conditions from the nominal rated
        12 volts. Significant drop in voltage can occur at times when
        high loads are applied to the battery, such as cranking the
        engine during start-up. In order to compensate for this drop in
        voltage available to energize the solenoid, the period of
        energization may be extended. </p>
      <p>The electronic controller 192 may thus incorporate a function
        to compare the actual voltage available to the solenoid against
        the battery rated voltage and if the actual voltage is below
        rated, an extension of the period of energization of the
        solenoid may be made. The degree of extension of the period
        relative to the drop in voltage may be pre-programmed into the
        electronic controller. </p>
      <p>The period of energization of the solenoid may be expressed by
        the formula </p>
      <p>Where </p>
      <p>PW.sub.e is actual period of energization </p>
      <p>PW.sub.o is a basic period of energization </p>
      <p>PW.sub.bv is battery voltage compensation period </p>
      <p>PW.sub.ACT is actuator rod position compensation period </p>
      <p>Typically PW.sub.o is the period of energization at noload on
        the engine and may be of the order of 12 to 15 milli-seconds,
        and the maximum increase in response to the actuation rod
        position may be 5 to 10 milli-seconds, the increase being linear
        over the range of movement of the actuator rod. The increase in
        energization period for decline in battery voltage may be of the
        order of 0.5 milli-seconds per volt. The increase of 5 to 10
        milli-seconds for actuation rod position is for full fuelling
        under transient load condition and is considerably greater (of
        the order of 50%) than that required under full-open-throttle
        steady conditions. The total time per cycle that the solenoid
        may be energised is of course limited by the cycle time of the
        engine and the time required to fill the metering chamber with
        fuel, the latter being of the order of 8 milli-seconds. </p>
      <p>It is desirable from combustion efficiency consideration for
        injection of the fuel to terminate at a fixed point in the
        engine cycle. Accordingly, when the period of energization of
        the solenoid is varied the termination point of the energization
        remains fixed and the additional time is obtained by advancing
        the initiation point of the energization. FIG. 11 of the
        drawings shows a typical variation in the duration of
        application of the air to the fuel being delivered in relation
        to the output of the potentiometer that is directly related to
        the quantity of fuel being delivered. </p>
      <p>In the preceding description the period of energization of the
        solenoid has made the variable in response to variations in
        metered quantities of fuel. However, it is to be understood that
        the purpose in varying that period is to achieve a corresponding
        variation in the mass of air available to effect the delivery of
        the metered quantity of fuel. As the pressure of the air supply
        is maintained constant by suitable pressure regulators, and in
        practical terms temperature variations normally encountered do
        not significantly influence the density of the air, the mass of
        air delivered to the metering chamber is directly related to the
        period that the air is available via the solenoid valve 150. </p>
      <p>When the engine is under transient conditions, requiring a
        rapid increase in fuelling, it can be difficult to control a
        fuel metering and injection system to deliver the optimum amount
        of fuel. From commencement of a transient the first one or two
        cycles of each cylinder should preferably have a higher fuel
        loading than when operating at the same throttle opening for
        steady state operation. This immediate enrichment of the fuel
        mixture is required to give the engine an acceptable rapid
        response when the throttle is suddenly opened. It has now been
        found that an acceptable transient response can be obtained from
        an engine utilizing the fuel metering system described above by
        increasing the mass of the air available to deliver the fuel
        that is not dependent on any increase in the metered quantity of
        fuel. </p>
      <p>During operation of an engine, the internal surfaces of the
        fuel delivery path, comprising delivery conduit 108 and
        associated injector nozzle 18, remain wetted by the fuel after
        each delivery of fuel and air through the nozzle 18 to the
        engine. During substantially smooth engine operation (i.e.
        steady state or light acceleration or deceleration) this
        residual wetting of the internal surfaces has no significant
        effect on the operation of the engine, as the amount of fuel
        retained by lthe wet surfaces remains substantially constant
        while the amount of air used for each delivery is constant. </p>
      <p>FIG. 11a illustrates the desired sequential fuel deliveries
        from the nozzle 18, for an engine transient requiring an
        immediate increase in fuel rate between deliveries 5 and 6. FIG.
        11b shows typical delivered fuel quantities where the fuel
        metering and injection system is arranged so that each of the
        twelve deliveries of fuel are propelled by the same mass of air.
        The degree of residual wetting of delivery line 108 is increased
        for increased metered quantities of fuel, and the amount of fuel
        delivered from the injector nozzle is seen to increase gradually
        between deliveries 5 and 9. From the first delivery at the new
        fuel metering rate, the amount of fuel delivered from nozzle 18
        would be less than the metered quantity determined at the
        position of the metering rod 115 in the metering chamber 120,
        because the mass of air available cannot immediately handle the
        increased quantity of fuel, and there is an increase in the
        residual wetness on the internal surfaces. However, the amount
        of fuel retained wetting delivery line 108 is a function both of
        the quantity of fuel metered at the metering chamber, and of the
        mass of the air used to deliver the metered fuel along the
        conduit and out of the nozzle. </p>
      <p>Consider now FIG. 11c where each delivery is derived from the
        same metered quantity of fuel being in the metering chamber 120.
        However, the mass of air for delivery 6 has been made larger
        than the others, by energizing the solenoid for a longer period.
        Delivery 6 ejects more fuel from the nozzle 18 than delivery 5,
        as it has reduced the quantity of fuel wetting the inner
        surfaces of delivery line 108. Further, delivery 7 passes
        correspondingly less fuel than delivery 5 as some fuel will be
        left in the delivery line 108 rewetting the surfaces.
        Subsequently delivery using the normal mass of air will deliver
        an amount of fuel from the nozzle corresponding to the metered
        quantity available in the metering chamber 120. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 11d this illustrates a repeat of the
        engine transient conditions of FIG. 5a except the system is now
        arranged so that the increased amount of fuel is propelled by an
        increased mass of air. Delivery 6, being the first delivery at
        the increased metered quantity of fuel and mass of air, will
        leave the delivery line 108 slightly less wet than the preceding
        delivery 5, while following pulses 7-8-9 etc., will maintain
        that reduced degree of wetting. The effect on delivered fuel
        quantities can be seen in FIG. 11d. The transient fuel
        enrichment is evident. It will be appreciated that this
        arrangement provides also the desirable fuel enleanment on
        deceleration transients due to the delivery line 108 entering a
        stage of increased residual wetting. </p>
      <p>The use of the capability of reducing the wetness of the
        internal surface of the fuel delivery conduit is preferably in
        combination with the increase in metered quantity of fuel as
        represented by FIG. 11d particularly when the engine is
        experiencing a severe transient condition. However, either
        capability may be used individually. The electronic controller
        192 may be arranged to respond to a transient condition sensed
        by a factor other than the actuator rod position in order to
        implement operation of the wetness reduction capability, such as
        by sensing the rate of change of the throttle position. </p>
      <p>It will however be appreciated that the invention described
        herein is not restricted to the particular apparatus described
        in detail above, but is applicable to all fuel metering and/or
        delivery systems utilizing a pulse of gas to propel a metered
        quantity of fuel for delivery to an engine. </p>
      <p>The metered quantity of fuel will depend on engine load,
        transient state, engine cylinder size, and selected operating
        air/fuel ratio, and may typically range from a few milligrams up
        to say 100 milligrams (or more) per injection. Correspondingly,
        the preferred mass of air delivered to the metering chamber per
        injection may vary over the range 2 milligrams to 10 (or more)
        milligrams per injection. An approximate volumetric ratio of air
        to fuel measured at S.T.P. is 50:1. Air supply pressures are
        regulated but metering operation may be achieved typically using
        supply pressures over the range 200 kPa to 1000 kPa (or even
        higher). Practically, the minimum pressure is determined by the
        need to operate valves, and to supply sufficient air mass, so
        that 400 kPa is a more usual value. Similarly, maximum pressures
        tend to be determined according to the need for simple and
        efficient supply sources. In an automotive application a single
        stage compressor would be desired, effectively limiting maximum
        pressures to around 800 kPa. </p>
      <p>Under some engine operating conditions it may be desirable to
        increase the mass of air per injection even though there is no
        corresponding increase in fuel quantity. One such condition may
        be during start-up of the engine particularly under cold start
        conditions. The additional air will contribute to improved
        atomization, particularly when the engine is cold and
        vaporization is not assisted by the heat of the engine. </p>
      <p>The engine condition in response to which the mass of air is
        varied may be timed from start-up so the air mass decreases as
        the time after start-up increases until the air mass falls to a
        predetermined limit. If the engine condition is temperature,
        again the air mass will decrease as the temperature increases
        until a predetermined limit is reached. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The fuel injection apparatus includes fuel a fuel metering
        chamber, an air supply chamber and a further chamber formed in a
        rigid body. A metering member is slidable within the fuel and
        gas chambers and passes through the further chamber. The amount
        of fuel fed to the metering chamber via valve means is
        controlled by the position of the metering member. An increase
        in pressure in the air supply chamber opens a valved passage in
        the metering member and the air expels the fuel from the
        metering chamber via check valve means. The further chamber
        collects any leakage of air or fuel past bearing means that
        receives the metering member. <br>
