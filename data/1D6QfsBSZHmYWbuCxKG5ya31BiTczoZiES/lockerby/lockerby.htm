    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Wings which redirect air to waggle
      sideways could cut airline fuel bills by 20% according to research
      funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
      (EPSRC) and Airbus in the UK.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The new approach, which promises to
      dramatically reduce mid-flight drag, uses tiny air powered jets
      which redirect the air, making it flow sideways back and forth
      over the wing. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The jets work by the Helmholtz
      resonance principle --- when air is forced into a cavity the
      pressure increases, which forces air out and sucks it back in
      again, causing an oscillation – the same phenomenon that happen
      when blowing over a bottle.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dr Duncan Lockerby, from the
      University of Warwick, who is leading the project, said: “This has
      come as a bit of a surprise to all of us in the aerodynamics
      community. It was discovered, essentially, by waggling a piece of
      wing from side to side in a wind tunnel.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“The truth is we’re not exactly sure
      why this technology reduces drag but with the pressure of climate
      change we can’t afford to wait around to find out. So we are
      pushing ahead with prototypes and have a separate three year
      project to look more carefully at the physics behind it.”</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Simon Crook, EPSRC Senior manager for
      aerospace &amp; defence, said: "This could help drastically reduce
      the environmental cost of flying. Research like this highlights
      the way UK scientists and engineers continue to make significant
      contributions to our lives."</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Notes for editors:</strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The UK aviation industry has announced
      targets to reduce emissions per passenger km by 50% by 2020.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Part of these savings will be made
      from lighter aircraft plus improvements in engines and fuel
      efficiencies but drag friction is also a major factor in fuel
      consumption during flights.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Engineers have known for some time
      that tiny ridges known as ‘riblets’ - like those found on sharks
      bodies - can reduce skin-friction drag, (a major portion of
      mid-flight drag), by around 5%. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But






        the new micro-jet system being developed by Dr Lockerby and his
        colleagues could reduce skin friction drag by up to 40%,</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The research, being carried out with
      scientists at Cardiff, Imperial, Sheffield, and Queen's University
      Belfast, is still at concept stage although it is hoped the new
      wings could be ready for trials as early as 2012. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If successful this technology could
      also have a major impact on the aerodynamic design and fuel
      consumptions of cars, boats and trains.<br>

      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;">Airbus's aim to reduce fuel burn per passenger km by at
        least 50% by 2020 will be difficult to achieve without a 30 to
        50% reduction in skin-friction drag / the drag arising from the
        friction generated on the aircraft's surface by the direct
        action of the air flow. We propose, therefore, to investigate
        novel, practical, effective flow-control techniques for
        achieving this aim.</span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;"></span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;">Skin-friction drag in turbulent boundary layers is
        governed by the flow physics very close to the surface in a
        region of the flow field known as the viscous sublayer. The
        generation of wall friction is also known to be quasi-cyclic. An
        essential characteristic of this cycle and the near-wall flow
        physics are streaks of low- and high-speed flow and their strong
        interaction with wave-like disturbances. The resulting evolution
        of the streaks and their explosive growth are intimately
        connected with the generation of wall friction and thereby drag.</span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;"></span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;">Most researchers focus on these sublayer streaks
        because they are very closest to the wall and amenable to
        wall-based actuation and sensing. We estimate, however, that
        there are O(109) sublayer streaks over the fuselage of an Airbus
        A340-300 at any instant during cruise. Others have made similar
        estimates. This enormous number makes it utterly impractical to
        implement an active control strategy targeting streaks
        individually. But disrupting the cycle in a global untargeted
        way is feasible. Riblets (minute peaks and troughs running in
        the flow direction with crossflow spacing of about 1/3 of a
        human hair width) do this by disrupting streak growth, in effect
        by regularizing and partially stabilizing them. But conventional
        riblets only deliver less than 1.5% drag reduction in flight
        tests, although 6% is achieved in idealized laboratory
        experiments. Unless this poor performance can be greatly
        improved, riblets are of little practical interest. Spanwise
        oscillations have been studied recently and shown to be much
        more effective than riblets at reducing skin-friction drag.
        Again these appear to work by forcing the streaks into more
        stable orientations. But this technique requires substantial
        power input. Given the cyclic process described above, another
        option is to disrupt the interaction of the waves and streaks
        with randomized perturbations. This was tried by Sirovich et al.
        who obtained 12% drag reduction in experimental flow studies
        with randomized surface roughness elements. This approach has
        not really been further investigated, although disrupting the
        wave-streak interaction with randomized perturbations is likely
        to be much more effective than riblets.</span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;"></span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;">We propose to investigate: (i) the use of randomized
        distributions of small-scale Helmholtz resonators that create
        strong microjets without any power input; thus are likely to be
        more effective than roughness elements or riblets; (ii)
        conventional riblets localize the streaks, thus combining them
        with resonators could be much more effective than riblets alone;
        (iii) improving effectiveness with unconventional riblets; e.g.,
        wavy riblets mimicking spanwise oscillations and other 3D
        patterns. Our study will be based on our simplified theoretical
        model of the sublayer streaks which can be used at flight
        Reynolds number. </span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;"></span><br>
      <span id="lblAbstract" class="DetailValue" style="font-weight:
        normal;">Helmholtz resonators hold great promise as passive
        control devices because: (i) the control disturbance produced is
        proportionately much greater than for roughness elements,
        including riblets; (ii) they require no power input; and (iii)
        consisting simply of a cavity with a necked exit orifice, they
        are straightforward to manufacture at MEMS (micro) scale.</span><br>

      <br>
      <span id="lblFinalReportSummary" class="DetailValue"
        style="font-weight: normal;">Airbus is seeking to develop
        technologies that will enable the ACARE VISION 2020 targets to
        be met, allowing sustained air travel growth whilst having zero
        additional environmental impact. Achieving this requires a 50%
        reduction in both fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. To meet
        the target of reducing fuel burn per passenger km by at least
        50% by 2020 will be difficult without a 30 to 50% reduction in
        skin-friction drag.</span><br>
      <span id="lblFinalReportSummary" class="DetailValue"
        style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br>
      <span id="lblFinalReportSummary" class="DetailValue"
        style="font-weight: normal;">At Warwick and Cardiff, we have
        developed efficient numerical methods to explore a range of
        novel, but practical, passive control strategies (i.e. those
        requiring no power input) capable of reducing skin-friction drag
        on passenger jet aircraft. Importantly, these simulation tools
        are capable of modelling basic configurations at flight-scale
        Reynolds numbers (far beyond the reach of conventional
        computational methods). Using these techniques, the
        characteristics of critical near-wall flow structures
        ('streaks') at cruise conditions have been estimated, and a very
        substantial drag reduction (~40%) has been demonstrated using
        spanwise flow oscillations at the flight scale. Passive means
        for creating spanwise oscillations have been explored, and the
        potential of using Helmholtz resonators (small plenum chambers,
        sunk beneath the aircraft surface) to generate oscillating jets
        has been identified. Low-speed Direct Numerical Simulations
        (coupled with an actuator model) have shown that, driven by
        boundary-layer pressure fluctuations, a strong and coherent jet
        flow is generated through the orifice of the resonator - such a
        response, in ensemble, could be harnessed to create spanwise
        forcing without the need for electrical input. The key
        achievements, which directly shape and support the follow-on
        EPSRC/Airbus project "Scalable Wirelessly Interconnected
        Flow-Control Technologies (SWIFT)" EP/G038686/1, are: </span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>&nbsp; -- A
      theoretical analysis is described that determines the conditions
      for Helmholtz resonance for a popular class of self-contained
      microjet actuator used in both synthetic- and pressure-jump
      (pulse-jet) mode. It was previously shown that the conditions for
      Helmholtz resonance are identical to those for optimizing actuator
      performance for maximum mass flux. The methodology is described
      for numerical-simulation studies on how Helmholtz resonance
      affects the interaction of active and nominally inactive micro-jet
      actuators with a laminar boundary layer. Two sets of numerical
      simulations were carried out. The first set models the interaction
      of an active actuator with the boundary layer. These simulations
      confirm that our criterion for Helmholtz resonance is broadly
      correct. When it is satisfied we find that the actuator cannot be
      treated as a predetermined wall boundary condition because the
      interaction with the boundary layer changes the pressure
      difference across the exit orifice thereby affecting the outflow
      from the actuator. We further show that strong inflow cannot be
      avoided even when the actuator is used in pressure-jump mode. In
      the second set of simulations two-dimensional Tollmien–Schlichting
      waves, with frequency comparable with, but not particularly close
      to, the Helmholtz resonant frequency, are incident on a nominally
      inactive micro-jet actuator. The simulations show that under these
      circumstances the actuators act as strong sources of 3D
      Tollmien–Schlichting waves. It is surmised that in the real-life
      aeronautical applications with turbulent boundary layers broadband
      disturbances of the pressure field, including acoustic waves,
      would cause nominally inactive actuators, possibly including
      pulsed jets, to act as strong disturbance sources. Should this be
      true it would probably be disastrous for engineering applications
      of such massless microjet actuators for flow control. <br>
