      <br>
      Scientists have developed a device that uses beams of electricity
      to extinguish flames<br>
      <br>
      It's certainly an established fact that electricity can cause
      fires, but today a group of Harvard scientists presented their
      research on the use of electricity for fighting fires. In a
      presentation at the 241st National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the
      American Chemical Society, Dr. Ludovico Cademartiri told of how
      they used a unique device to shoot beams of electricity at an open
      flame over one foot tall. Almost immediately, he said, the flame
      was extinguished. On a larger scale, such a system would minimize
      the amount of water that needed to be sprayed into burning
      buildings, both saving water and limiting water damage to those
      buildings.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently, it has been known for over 200 years that electricity
      affects fire – it can cause flames to change in character, or even
      stop burning altogether. According to Cademartiri, a postdoctoral
      fellow in the group of Prof. George M. Whitesides at Harvard
      University, what hasn't been looked into much is the science
      behind the relationship. It turns out that soot particles within
      flames can easily become charged, and therefore can cause flames
      to lose stability when the local electrical fields are altered.<br>
      <br>
      The Harvard device consists of a 600-watt amplifier hooked up to a
      wand-like probe, which is what delivers the electrical beams. The
      researchers believe that a much lower-powered amplifier should
      deliver similar results, which could allow the system to worn as a
      backpack, by firefighters. It could also be mounted on ceilings,
      like current sprinkler systems, or be remotely-controlled.<br>
      <br>
      Cademartiri believes the technology would work best for fires in
      confined spaces, such as aboard submarines, but not so much for
      wide-open areas like forests. As it was additionally found that
      electrical waves can affect the heat and distribution of flames,
      he also thinks their discovery could be used to boost the
      efficiency of devices that involve controlled combustion, such as
      engines, power plants, and cutting and welding torches.<br>

      Fighting out of control fires could become faster and more
      eco-friendly with an unusual technique that snuffs out flames
      using blasts of electrical waves.<br>
      <br>
      ANAHEIM, March 27, 2011 — A curtain of flame halts firefighters
      trying to rescue a family inside a burning home. One with a
      special backpack steps to the front, points a wand at the flame,
      and shoots a beam of electricity that opens a path through the
      flame for the others to pass and lead the family to safety.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists today described a discovery that could underpin a new
      genre of fire-fighting devices, including sprinkler systems that
      suppress fires not with water, but with zaps of electric current,
      without soaking and irreparably damaging the contents of a home,
      business, or other structure. Reporting at the 241st National
      Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS),
      Ludovico Cademartiri, Ph.D., and his colleagues in the group of
      George M. Whitesides, Ph.D., at Harvard University, picked up on a
      200-year-old observation that electricity can affect the shape of
      flames, making flames bend, twist, turn, flicker, and even
      snuffing them out. However, precious little research had been done
      over the years on the phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      “Controlling fires is an enormously difficult challenge,” said
      Cademartiri, who reported on the research. “Our research has shown
      that by applying large electric fields we can suppress flames very
      rapidly. We’re very excited about the results of this relatively
      unexplored area of research.”<br>
      <br>
      Firefighters currently use water, foam, powder and other
      substances to extinguish flames. The new technology could allow
      them to put out fires remotely — without delivering material to
      the flame — and suppress fires from a distance. The technology
      could also save water and avoid the use of fire-fighting materials
      that could potentially harm the environment, the scientists
      suggest.<br>
      <br>
      In the new study, they connected a powerful electrical amplifier
      to a wand-like probe and used the device to shoot beams of
      electricity at an open flame more than a foot high. Almost
      instantly, the flame was snuffed out. Much to their fascination,
      it worked time and again.<br>
      <br>
      The device consisted of a 600-watt amplifier, or about the same
      power as a high-end car stereo system. However, Cademartiri
      believes that a power source with only a tenth of this wattage
      could have similar flame-suppressing effect. That could be a boon
      to firefighters, since it would enable use of portable flame-tamer
      devices, which perhaps could be hand-carried or fit into a
      backpack.<br>
      <br>
      But how does it work? Cademartiri acknowledged that the phenomenon
      is complex with several effects occurring simultaneously. Among
      these effects, it appears that carbon particles, or soot,
      generated in the flame are key for its response to electric
      fields. Soot particles can easily become charged. The charged
      particles respond to the electric field, affecting the stability
      of flames, he said.<br>
      <br>
      “Combustion is first and foremost a chemical reaction – arguably
      one of the most important – but it’s been somewhat neglected by
      most of the chemical community,” said Cademartiri. “We’re trying
      to get a more complete picture of this very complex interaction.”<br>
      <br>
      Cademartiri envisions that futuristic electrical devices based on
      the phenomenon could be fixed on the ceilings of buildings or
      ships, similar to stationary water sprinklers now in use.
      Alternatively, firefighters might carry the flame-tamer in the
      form of a backpack and distribute the electricity to fires using a
      handheld wand. Such a device could be used, for instance, to make
      a path for firefighters to enter a fire or create an escape path
      for people to exit, he said.<br>
      <br>
      The system shows particular promise for fighting fires in enclosed
      quarters, such as armored trucks, planes, and submarines. Large
      forest fires, which spread over much larger areas, are not as
      suitable for the technique, he noted.<br>
      <br>
      Cademartiri also reported how he and his colleagues found that
      electrical waves can control the heat and distribution of flames.
      As a result, the technology could potentially improve the
      efficiency of a wide variety of technologies that involve
      controlled combustion, including automobile engines, power plants,
      and welding and cutting torches, he said.<br>
      <br>
      The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (U.S. Department of
      Defense) and the U.S. Department of Energy funded this study.<br>

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>According to various aspects of the present application,
      methods and apparatuses for manipulating flames are provided. The
      manipulation may take various forms, including, but not limited
      to, extinguishing a flame, suppressing a flame, bending a flame,
      controlling mixing of the flame, and concentrating the flame. Such
      manipulation may be useful in various applications in which
      control of a flame is desired.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first aspect of the present application, a flame
      may be manipulated by applying an electric field to the flame. The
      electric field may be a time-varying electric field, and in some
      embodiments may be an oscillating electric field (e.g.,
      oscillating between a positive electric potential and a negative
      electric potential).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, in some embodiments the electric field may have a
      gradient associated therewith, rather than being a uniform
      electric field. In some embodiments, the electric field may
      exhibit a gradient in three dimensions, though not all embodiments
      are limited in this respect. Thus, according to a non-limiting
      embodiment of the present aspect, a flame may be manipulated with
      an oscillating gradient electric field. The electric field may be
      applied to the flame with one or more electrodes, as non-limiting
      examples.<br>
      <br>
      The aspects described above, as well as additional aspects, are
      described further below. These aspects may be used individually,
      all together, or in any combination of two or more, as the
      technology is not limited in this respect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Manipulation of Flames Using Time- Varying Electric Fields</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to a first aspect, manipulation of flames is
      accomplished using time- varying electric fields. In one
      embodiment, the time-variation may be sinusoidal, and the electric
      field may be an oscillating electric field. The electric field
      may, in some embodiments, have a gradient, which may facilitate
      achieving certain types of manipulation. Various non-limiting
      examples are described further below.<br>
      <br>
      Manipulation of flames using a time- arying electric field may
      depend, at least partially, on some parameters of the flame as
      well as some parameters of the electric field. For example, flame
      parameters which may influence whether, and to what extent, the
      flame may be manipulated by application thereto of a time-varying
      electric field include the amount of soot in the flame and the
      size of the flame source (e.g., the size of the burner used to
      create the flame if a burner is used) Parameters of the electric
      field that may impact the effectiveness of manipulation include
      the field strength, field gradient, and field frequency (e.g., in
      those embodiments in which an oscillating electric field is used).
      The distance of the electric field source (e.g., an electrode)
      from the flame as well as the electrode configuration may also
      impact the effectiveness of manipulation.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants have appreciated that flames are charge neutral
      polarizable media. The effect of electric field stimulation on a
      flame can be understood by considering the concentration of ions
      that is present in most flames, which may range, for example, from
      approximately 10&lt;8&gt; to approximately 10&lt;11&gt; ions per
      cubic centimeter (ions/cm&lt;3&gt;). Despite their low
      concentration, the driven motion of these ions in response to an
      external electric field, and the consequent transfer of momentum
      to neutral molecules, imparts upon the flame a collective
      behavior. For sufficiently strong electric fields, this process
      can result in macroscopic gas flows-so-called ionic or electric
      wind-with speeds of up to ten meters per second. When placed in
      the proximity of a flame, the resulting gas flows may serve to
      manipulate the flame. However, not all embodiments described
      herein relating to manipulation of flames with electric fields are
      limited to manipulation arising from generation of an electric
      wind, as other physical mechanisms may also or alternatively be
      implicated. In fact, in at least some embodiments, manipulation of
      a flame is achieved without an ionic wind.<br>
      <br>
      According to one non-limiting embodiment, a flame may be
      extinguished by application thereto of a time-varying gradient
      electric field. The electric field may be applied by an electrode
      placed in proximit to the flame. Various types of electrodes may
      be used. According to one embodiment, a rod-shaped electrode may
      be used (e.g., a wand-shaped electrode). According to one
      embodiment, a point electrode, e.g., from a wire, may be used.
      According to another embodiment, a wire electrode may be used.
      Alternatively, plate shaped electrodes may be used in some
      embodiments. The electrode may be covered/insulated in some
      embodiments, for example to minimize or prevent formation of a
      corona on the electrode. The electrode may have any suitable size,
      shape, and material to provide a desired electric field. As will
      be appreciated from the following non-limiting examples,
      manipulation of flames (e.g., extinction) may be achieved 5
      according to some non-limiting embodiments with one or more
      electrodes (e.g., with one electrode, two electrodes, three
      electrodes, or more). Extinction may occur when lift off is
      achieved, which may represent the displacement of the combustion
      zone of the flame from the burner<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the electrode (or electrodes) used to apply a
      time-varying<br>
      <br>
      10 electric field may be stationary. In other embodiments, the
      electrode(s) may be mobile.<br>
      <br>
      Further explanation of a non-limiting example of the use of mobile
      electrodes to apply a time-varying electric field to a flame is
      provided in FIG. 13.<br>
      <br>
      A non- limiting example of a configuration in which a flame may be
      extinguished using an oscillating gradient electric field is
      illustrated in FIG. 1. The illustrated system 100 includes a
      chamber 102, an electrode 104, a counter electrode 106, an
      electric signal source 108, a burner 110, and a flame 112.
      Diffusers 114 are also included to introduce oxygen into the
      chamber. A sheath 116 (e.g., made of borosilicate glass or any
      other insulating material) encloses at least one end of electrode
      104 proximate the flame. The electrode 104 may be spaced from the
      flame by a distance [delta].<br>
      <br>
      20 A non- limiting example of a suitable configuration for the
      electrode 104 and sheath 116 is illustrated in FIGs. 11A and 11B,
      which include various dimensions. It should be appreciated that
      other configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      As shown, the flame 112 may be deflected from the vertical 118 by
      an angle a in response to application thereto of an oscillating
      gradient electric field from the electrode<br>
      <br>
      25 104. The electric field may have any suitable frequency and
      magnitude to deflect the flame by a desired angle a, as the
      various aspects described herein are not limited to use of
      electric fields having any particular magnitude and or frequency.
      For purposes of explanation, some non-limiting examples arc
      described further below.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the illustrated electrode
      configuration is non-limiting.<br>
      <br>
      30 While a wire-shaped electrode is illustrated, other shapes may
      be used, including rod- shaped electrodes, and in some embodiments
      plate shaped electrodes, though these are only non-limiting
      examples. In the illustrated configuration, the resulting electric
      field may exhibit a gradient in three dimensions, though not all
      embodiments are limited in this respect. The configuration may
      allow for achieving larger fields strengths and/or field gradients
      than may be possible in configurations in which the electric field
      gradient is limited to only two dimensions. Thus, a configuration
      in which a gradient is exhibited in three dimensions may
      facilitate achieving various types of manipulation of a flame,
      such as extinction.<br>
      <br>
      Also worth noting is that in some embodiments (e.g., the
      configuration of FIG. 1), the flame may be positioned
      substantially between the electrode and the counter electrode (e g
      , the flame may be located on a line between the electrode and the
      counter electrode) Such a configuration may facilitate achieving
      the types of manipulation described herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A non- limiting example of the operation of system 100 is now
      provided for purposes of illustration. It should be appreciated
      that the manner of operation and the specific parameters listed
      are non-limiting.<br>
      <br>
      The methane burner 110 was enclosed in a 0.1 m&lt;3&gt; cubic
      chamber 102 of 0.5 cm- thick panels of ROB AX(R), a refractory,
      electrically insulating, and highly transparent glass ceramic. The
      top panel was instead a glass-filled PTFE sheet (0.32 cm x 61 cm x
      61 cm) with a hole 120 (15 cm diameter) in its center, which
      served as a chimney for the combustion products. The burner
      comprised a cylindrical tube of machinable A1203 (0.32 cm inner
      diameter; 2 cm outer diameter; 25 cm in length) and was lodged
      tightly into a hole in the center of the bottom panel of the
      chamber. Methane was introduced from the bottom hole of the burner
      through a one-way valve, and the flow was monitored by a gas flow
      meter. The methane flow was kept at 5 0+-23 ml/min for all
      experiments reported here.<br>
      <br>
      Air was introduced into the system via two flexible bubble
      diffusers (Flexible Bubble Wand, Marineland), which lined the
      bottom inside perimeter of the chamber. The diffusers were covered
      with a PTFE mesh (635um x 127um rhombic-shaped holes) to further
      diffuse the inlet air flow and connected to a compressed air tank
      through a flow meter. The air flow rate was maintained at 19+-2
      1/min for all experiments.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode 104 was a Pt wire (0.5 mm diameter) with a rounded
      parabolic-like tip created via chemical etching, though the
      aspects described herein as utilizing a rounded parabolic-like
      electrode are not limited to the manner in which the electrode is
      created. Furthermore, other electrode geometries are also
      possible, as a rounded parabolic-like electrode tip is a
      non-limiting example. The electrode was encased in custom-made
      borosilicate glass sheath (2 mm thick on the sides of the wire, 5
      mm thick at the tip). The purpose of the sheath was to (i)
      electrically insulate the flame from the electrode (e.g., to
      prevent arc formation between the electrode and the flame) and
      (ii) to prevent the formation of the so-called ionic wind
      emanating from the corona discharge at the electrode tip. The
      electrode was connected to an AC power amplifier (TREK 30/20A),
      driven by a signal generator (Agilent 33220A). The amplifier's
      output current and voltage were monitored with an oscilloscope
      (Tektronix TDS 2024D)<br>
      <br>
      The electrode 104 was positioned horizontally at a height of 1.5
      cm above the burner 110, and its tip was oriented towards the
      center of the burner (cf. Fig. 1) The sheathed electrode was
      supported by a stack of glass slides positioned 7 cm from the
      burner and fastened with insulating tape.<br>
      <br>
      The counter electrode 106 was a 45 cm x 45 cm x 1 cm aluminum
      plate, fastened to the interior side of the chamber opposite the
      electrode and the flame. The distance between the electrode tip
      and the plate was [delta] = 25.5 cm.<br>
      <br>
      Before an experiment, the interior of the chamber was cleaned of
      soot. The flame and the air flow were turned on at least one hour
      before the beginning of the experiment to allow the thermalization
      of the setup. The temperature at the internal surface of the side
      panels of the box was found to stabilize at 39+-2 [deg.]C.<br>
      The flame was subjected to AC fields using a sinusoidal waveform
      of various amplitudes (15-30 kV) and frequencies (10-2000 Hz). The
      distance between the tip of the electrode (i.e., the outer surface
      of the glass sheath) and the mouth of the burner was varied from 6
      to 15 mm.<br>
      <br>
      For a constant voltage and a distance [delta] &lt; 11 mm, as the
      frequency of the oscillation of the voltage (and therefore the
      electric field) was increased, the flame was increasingly
      deflected. This deflection of the body of the flame is constant in
      time and no obvious turbulence is observed. As the frequency is
      further increased and the deflection approaches 90[deg.] the flame
      is extinguished with increasing probability.<br>
      <br>
      For a given voltage, V, frequency, f, and distance, [delta], the
      angle of deflection a and the probability of extinction, P, were
      measured. Movies (at 1 frame per second) were collected of all
      events. The angle of deflection a of the flame for a certain set
      of experimental parameters was determined by averaging all of the
      stills (still images) from all events performed under those
      conditions. The resulting image was then analyzed to determine the
      major axis of "inertia" of the flame. The manner of analysis is
      described in the Appendix of the present application, though it
      should be appreciated that the various aspects of the technology
      described herein are not limited to the manner in which deflection
      is calculated, or to calculating deflection of the flame at all.<br>
      <br>
      The probability of extinction, P, was estimated as the fraction of
      successful extinction events (within a set of 10-30) following the
      application of the field for 10 sec. If the flame was extinguished
      by the field, it was reignited, and the flame was left burning
      undisturbed for 30 seconds before attempting another extinction
      event If the flame was not extinguished by the field within 10
      seconds following the application of the field, the field was
      turned off. The flame was then left undisturbed for 30 seconds
      before starting another event. These 30 second pauses between
      events prevented correlation between events.<br>
      <br>
      Manipulation of flames using time- varying electric fields may
      apply to various flame types (i.e., flames resulting from
      combustion of various types of fuels), unless otherwise stated,
      including liquid, gas, and solid flames, flames categorized as
      National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Class A (e.g., paper,
      wood, plastic, etc.), Class B (liquid and gaseous fuel sources),
      and or Class C, flames from gels, or any other types of flames.
      Ethanol, methanol, toluene, and hexane are non-limiting examples
      of liquid flame types to which one or more aspects of the present
      application may apply. In some embodiments, diffusion flames may
      be used. In some embodiments, flames having conductive
      particulates may exhibit the greatest degree of response to an
      applied electric field. The breadth in flame types to which the
      presently described techniques may apply is due at least in part
      to the fact that oscillating gradient electric fields operate on a
      minority component of the flame which has a characteristic which
      is shared across flames of the most diverse kinds: electric
      charge, and not on parameters such as fuel and oxidizer
      availability, heat, or the radical chain reaction. Thus, again,
      ethanol, methanol, toluene, and hexane are only non-limiting
      examples of fuel sources to which aspects of the present
      application may be applied. Other types of flames are also
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      The electric field may have any suitable magnitude and frequency
      to extinguish a given flame. In some embodiments, such as that of
      FIG. 1, the electric field may be an alternating current (AC)
      electric field having a sinusoidal waveform. The signal generating
      the electric field may have any suitable voltage to generate a
      suitable magnitude electric field. As a non-limiting example, the
      voltage of the applied signal maybe between 15-30 kV, between
      10-50 kV (e.g., 10 kV, 15 kV, 20 kV, etc.), between 20-25 kV, or
      have any other suitable value. The frequency of oscillation of the
      applied signal (the signal applied to the electrode 104), and
      therefore of the electric field itself, maybe, for example,
      between 10-2000Hz, between 100-50000 Hz, between 100-300 Hz,
      between 300-600 Hz, between 400-500 Hz, between 100-1000 Hz (e.g.,
      100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, 600 Hz, etc.), or any
      other suitable value, as these are non- limiting examples.
      According to a non-limiting embodiment, an electric field having
      the following parameters may be used to manipulate, and in some
      instances extinguish, a flame: E = 1 MV/m, dE/dr = 10&lt;8&gt;
      V/m&lt;2&gt;, and f = 1000 Hz). Other values are possible.<br>
      <br>
      The electric field may have any suitable gradient. According to
      some embodiments, the gradient may be a three-dimensional
      gradient, while in others the gradient may exist in fewer than
      three dimensions (e.g., two dimensions). The gradient may range,
      in some non-limiting embodiments, between approximately dE/dr =
      10&lt;6&gt; V/m&lt;2&gt; and dE/dr = 10&lt;10&gt; V/m&lt;2&gt;
      (e.g., dE/dr = 10&lt;7&gt; V/m&lt;2&gt;, dE/dr = 10&lt;8&gt;
      V/m&lt;2&gt;, dE/dr = 10&lt;9&gt; V/m&lt;2&gt;, etc.). Other
      gradient values are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      The distance from the electrode generating the electric field to
      the source of the flame (e.g., to a burner when a burner is used)
      may take any suitable value. According to some embodiments, the
      closer the electric field source is to the flame the more easily
      the flame may be extinguished. Accordmg to some embodiments, the
      source electrode may be between approximately 5 mm and 30 mm from
      the source of the flame (e.g., between 6 mm and 15 mm, between 10
      mm and 25 mm, etc.), or any other suitable distance.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the electric field characteristics and the distance
      from the electrode to the flame on the deflection and extinction
      of flames is illustrated in some non-limiting example graphs, and
      now explained. Generally, both the angle of deflection, a, and the
      probability of extinction, P, increase with increasing frequency.
      More specifically, the dependence of P on frequency exhibits a
      threshold-like behavior, whereby the flame is reliably
      extinguished primarily, and in some situations only, above a
      certain "critical" frequency, which we define as the frequency at
      which P = 50%.<br>
      <br>
      FIGs. 2 and 3 illustrate data indicative of this generalization.
      Figure 2 shows a graph of the values of P and a (in degrees) as a
      function of frequency (in Hz) for V= 20 kV and [delta]= 6 mm.
      Above the graph is a set of three pictures of the flame 210 taken
      at the indicated frequencies (20 Hz, 310 Hz, and 400 Hz), showing
      the increasing deflection in the flame 210 with increasing
      frequency. The positions of the burner 212 and of the electrode
      214 are also indicated.<br>
      <br>
      The probability of extinction, P, increases with increasing
      voltage of the applied signal, and therefore with increasing
      electric field strength. FIG. 3 illustrates a graph showing a
      non-limiting example of data supporting this statement. This plot
      shows the dependence on frequency (in Hz) of the probability of
      extinction, P, of a methane/air conical diffusion flame as a
      function of the peak voltage of the sinusoidal voltage signal
      applied to the electrode. No extinction was observed for V &lt; 16
      kV within the range of frequencies experimentally tested.<br>
      <br>
      The critical frequency, decreases with increasing voltage (see
      also FIG. 4, which shows the dependence of the critical frequency
      (in Hz) at which flame extinction ensues on the peak voltage (in
      kV) applied to the electrode, as obtained from the data shown in
      FIG. 2), in a manner that can be fitted by a decaying exponential
      (see FIG. 4):<br>
      <br>
      (fc = ae&lt;"bv&gt;, where [3/4] is the critical frequency, V is
      the voltage of the applied signal, a = 1.1 X 10&lt;5&gt; Hz and b
      = 0.28 V&lt;"1&gt;) or with a power law (see FIG. 4) (fc =
      cV&lt;d&gt; with c=3.2 X 10&lt;9&gt; Hz and d=5.4).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates dependence on frequency (in Hz) of the
      probability of extinction, P, of a methane/air conical diffusion
      flame as a function of the distance between the tip of the metal
      electrode and the mouth of the burner. The data represent five
      distances: 6 mm, 10 mm, 11 mm 12.5 mm and 15 mm. It can be seen
      that P decreases with increasing distance. The extinction behavior
      is similar for [delta] = 6, 10, and 11 mm, while there is no
      extinction for [delta] &gt; 12.5 mm. While at 11 mm of distance,
      the response of the flame to the field is repulsive, at 12.5 mm
      the response is a mixture of attractive and repulsive, with the
      flame becoming shorter and wider, as if stretched horizontally by
      the field. The critical frequency of suppression may be
      independent of distance, as long as the distance is sufficiently
      small to elicit the suppressive "response" (see Fig. 6, which
      shows the dependence of the critical frequency (in Hz) on the
      distance (in mm) between the tip of the Pt electrode and the mouth
      of the burner as obtained from the data shown in Figure 4). Such
      behavior may arise from a very sharp distance dependence (e.g., a
      power law with large exponent) of the effective force operating on
      the flame.<br>
      <br>
      Extinction of a flame by application of a time-varying electric
      field thereto, when P = -50%, may progress in stages. The flame is
      initially strongly deflected (-70-90 degrees). The flame loses all
      traces of soot emission (possibly due to cooling, or more
      plausibly due to the efficient removal of soot particles from the
      hot zone). The flame front oscillates erratically at about 2-5 cm
      from the burner, as if pushed by two opposing driving forces. On
      one side the flame propagation which drives the flame front back
      to the burner. On the other side, the effective force generated by
      the electric field is pushing it away from the burner. This
      behavior fades as P increases to 100% with increasing frequency.
      In such conditions extinction happens within the first second of
      the application of the field At frequencies much lower than the
      critical frequency (P~0), the flame remains "attached" to the
      burner and is only deflected.<br>
      <br>
      Though the various aspects described herein are not limited to
      utilizing any particular physical mechanism for extinguishing
      flames, it is noted that in at least some embodiments the
      extinction of the flame may be caused at least in part by forcing
      the combustion region away from the fuel source using an
      oscillating gradient electric field. The electric field may
      accelerate the ions within the flame, resulting in a transfer of
      momentum having a non-zero net average, and thus leading to
      repulsion of the flame from the electrode applying the electric
      field. When the speed of repulsion of the flame is less than the
      speed of propagation of the flame to the burner, the flame may not
      be extinguished but rather may be deflected. When the speed at
      which the flame is projected away from the burner (the fuel
      source) is greater than the speed at which the flame can propagate
      to the burner (which happens to be approximately 1 m/s for a
      CH^air diffusion flame), the flame may be blown off the fuel
      source and thus extinguished.<br>
      <br>
      The behavior of flames in response to the application of a
      time-varying electric field may be due, at least in part, to the
      Ponderomotive Force. The Ponderomotive force, Fp, may take the
      form:<br>
      <br>
      where m and q are, respectively, the mass and charge of the
      particle, E0 is the magnitude of the electric field given by
      K(r,t) = E0(r) cos(ait), and [lambda] is a damping factor which
      accounts for the viscous drag due to the surrounding fluid (e.g.,
      air).<br>
      <br>
      The Ponderomotive Force may cause ions of either polarity
      (positive or negative) to be repelled from the electrode applying
      the oscillating gradient electric field. The particles may
      oscillate and drift towards regions of low electric field density.
      When the amplitude of the oscillations is small with respect to
      length scales of the electric field gradients, the oscillation
      center moves as if acted upon by a force, which is the so-called
      Ponderomotive Force. The Ponderomotive force acts symmetrically on
      both positive and negative charged species, may require
      oscillating electric fields in at least some situations, and
      generally increases with increasing field gradients. The
      Ponderomotive Force may also act most effectively in at least some
      embodiments on large particles, such as soot in a flame<br>
      <br>
      It is also noted that the manipulation of flames using oscillating
      gradient electric fields, as described herein, need not require
      contact between the electrode(s) applying the electric field and
      the flame.<br>
      <br>
      As should be appreciated from the foregoing, application of a
      time-varying gradient electric field may bend (or deflect) a
      flame, for example prior to extinguishing the flame. Thus,
      according to one embodiment, a flame may be manipulated by bending
      the flame via application of a time-varying (e.g., oscillating)
      gradient electric field thereto. The field have any suitable
      frequency, magnitude, gradient, and spacing from the flame to
      generate a desired degree of bending. Similarly, a flame may be
      squashed (e.g., minimized) or stretched if a time-varying electric
      field is applied parallel to the direction of the flame.<br>
      <br>
      According to another non-limiting embodiment, mixing of a flame
      may be controlled at least in part by application thereto of a
      time-varying gradient electric field. As explained previously,
      application of a time- varying gradient electric field to a flame
      may generate motion of ionic particles within the flame, which may
      itself give rise to collective motion of the flame, for example as
      a result of ionic particles of the flame transferring momentum to
      neutral particles of the flame. The resultant motion may enhance,
      or alternatively suppress depending on the conditions, mixing of
      the flame. Thus, various applications in which control over flame
      mixing is desired may be realized.<br>
      <br>
      According to another non-limiting embodiment, concentration of a
      flame may be achieved by application of a time- varying gradient
      electric field thereto. FIG. 7 illustrates a non-limiting example
      of a configuration which may be used. As shown, an electric field
      source may be configured substantially parallel to the direction
      of flow of the flame. For example, a burner 702 may have an
      electrode 704 configured with respect thereto such that an
      electric field 706 is generated in a direction substantially
      parallel to the direction of propagation of the flame 708. A
      time-varying applied signal 710 (e.g., an alternating current (AC)
      signal) may be applied to the electrode to generate the electric
      field. A grid 712 may be positioned a distance d from the top of
      the burner. The distance d may be between approximately 5-15 cm
      (e.g., 10 cm), or have any other suitable value, as these are
      non-limiting examples. Application of the electric field may
      result in concentration of the flame across a smaller area of the
      grid 712 than would occur absent the electric field. Thus, in some
      non-limiting embodiments, the width (from left to right in FIG 7)
      of the flame 708 may be greater when no electric field is applied
      than when the electric field 706 is applied (i.e., the electric
      field 706 may "shrink" the width of the flame, thus concentrating
      the flame). A non-limiting example of operation of the
      configuration of FIG. 7 is now described, together with results
      therefrom in FIGs. 8A-8D.<br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      FIGs. 8A-8D illustrate the setup of an apparatus conforming to the
      general configuration of FIG. 7, and which may be used to
      concentrate a flame. The bottom photograph in each of FIGs. 8A-8D
      illustrates the physical setup, showing a perspective view of the
      metal grid. The dark spot in the center of the metal grid
      represents the area of the grid contacted by the flame. As
      described further below, it can be seen that the area changes
      depending on the parameters of the applied electric field. The top
      image in each of FIGs. 8A-8D represents a thermal image taken of
      the metal grid for the corresponding physical setup.<br>
      <br>
      The setup comprises a ceramic burner flowing ~ 1 L/min of methane.
      The methane is lit. The flame is then arrested by the thick metal
      grid placed flat above the flame. The grid functions as the
      ground, while a ring electrode is applied to the burner.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8A illustrates the scenario in which no electric field is
      applied. The maximal temperature observed on the top of the grid
      was 631[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8B illustrates the scenario in which a voltage of 18 kV at
      100 Hz is applied to the ring electrode surrounding the burner, as
      mentioned previously in the manner illustrated by the
      configuration of FIG. 7. Thus, an electric field is applied to the
      flame. The maximal temperature increased by approximately 100
      degrees to 731[deg.] C (which appeared to be the equilibrium)
      compared to that of FIG. 8A within 40 seconds. In these conditions
      there is the occurrence of slight sparking between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      To verify if the sparks are responsible for this increase in
      temperature, the conditions of FIG. 8C and 8D were tested. FIG. 8C
      illustrates a scenario in which no 5 electric field is applied, as
      in FIG. 8A. FIG. 8D illustrates the scenario in which a voltage of
      9 kV at 100 Hz (a voltage at which no sparking occurred) is
      applied to the ring electrode surrounding the burner. The
      temperature still increased by 50 degrees compared to that of FIG
      8C in approximately 40 seconds<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it should be appreciated from FIGs. 8A-8D and the data
      illustrated therein 10 that according to one or more embodiments a
      flame may be concentrated over a smaller area when an electric
      field is applied.<br>
      <br>
      According to another non-limiting embodiment, a flame may be
      stabilized by the 15 application of a time-varying electric field,
      and in some instances a time- varying gradient electric field,
      thereto. The flame may be stabilized in that its ability to remain
      in existence when it otherwise would be extinguished may be
      increased. A non-limiting example of a configuration resulting in
      stabilization of a flame is that illustrated in FIG. 7.
      Application of the electric field to the flame as illustrated may
      allow the flame to exist at 20 higher fuel flow rates than would
      be possible absent the electric field. The electric field may have
      any suitable strength and frequency to accomplish this result.<br>
      <br>
      According to another non-limiting embodiment, an electric field
      may be used to suppress a flame. The electric field may, for
      example, be configured to create a boundary between a fuel source
      and a flame, such that the fuel source does not ignite. A non- 25
      limiting example is illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      As shown, a flame 902 may be positioned near a fuel source (e.g.,
      a burner) 904. The fuel 906 emitted by the fuel source 904 may
      initially propagate toward the flame 902. However, application of
      a time-varying gradient electric field, in the manner described
      previously herein, from an electrode 908 (as a result of
      application of an applied signal 30 910) may prevent the flame
      from igniting the fuel source, thus suppressing the flame.<br>
      <br>
      The electric field may create an outflow from the flame (in the
      direction of the arrows) which may divert the fuel from the flame.
      This, however, is a non-limiting example. According to another
      non-limiting embodiment, a time-varying electric field may be used
      to increase the flow and nebulization of a fluid. A non-limiting
      configuration is illustrated in FIG. 10. As shown, container 1002
      may include a fuel 1004 and a plume 1006. Application of a
      time-varying gradient electric field thereto in the manner
      previously described herein, using an electrode 1008 may increase
      the plume.<br>
      <br>
      According to another non-limiting embodiment, a Davy Lamp
      configuration is used to manipulate a flame. In some such
      embodiments, a flame arrester grid may be used as one electrode A
      combination of thermal quenching and electric fields may be used
      to extinguish the flame. FIG. 12 illustrates a non-limiting
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 12, the apparatus 1200 may include a first
      electrode 1202 and a second electrode 1204. A power supply 1206
      may apply a voltage difference between the electrodes 1202 and
      1204.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode 1202 may be a metal mesh structure having a mesh
      size sufficient to allow a fuel source to pass through. In some
      non-limiting embodiments, the electrode 1202 may be considered a
      flame arrestor grid, as will be further appreciated from the
      discussion below. The mesh size should be such that liquid can
      rapidly pass through, but not so large that the flame is not
      quenched (as described below). Non-limiting examples for suitable
      mesh sizes are between 1 mm and 1cm.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode 1204 may be any suitable electrode formed of any
      suitable material. The power supply 1206 may apply a direct
      current (DC) or AC signal to the electrodes 1202 and 1204.
      Non-limiting examples of suitable voltages for AC signals include
      greater than 5 kV at a frequency greater than 1 Hz (e.g., between
      1 Hz and 1 kHz, or even greater). Non-limiting examples of
      suitable DC signals include -5 kV, between 5 kV and 50 kV, 50 kV,
      greater than 50 kV, or any other suitable voltages.<br>
      <br>
      If fuel on the electrode 1202 catches fire 1208, a suitable
      electric potential may be applied to the electrode 1202 by the
      power supply 1206. The fire may be extinguished, for instance
      because contact with the electrode 1202 may thermally quench the
      fire 1208 resulting in extinguished fuel 1210 passing through the
      mesh of electrode 1202 to the electrode 1204. The thermal
      quenching may separate the flame from the liquid fuel and allow
      the liquid fuel to pass through the mesh. The electric field from
      the electrode 1202 may also facilitate extinguishing the flame, in
      addition to the thermal quenching. For instance, the flame may be
      extinguished in approximately 1/3 the time as would occur without
      the field (e.g., in approximately 4 seconds compared to 12 seconds
      which may be required without the electric field). Applying the
      electric field may also stabilize the flame.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes 1202 and 1204 may take any suitable configuration
      with respect to each other. For example, they may be separated by
      between 1 mm and 1 meter, greater than 1 m, or any other suitable
      distance. The electrode 1204 may be below the electrode 1202 or
      above it, as the relative orientation is not limiting.<br>
      <br>
      The configuration of FIG. 12 may be used in various products. For
      example, a floor or flooring system may be constructed in the
      configuration illustrated Other applications are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, an electrode may be moved relative to a
      flame, for example by swiping the electrode across a flame. A
      non-limiting example of a suitable configuration is illustrated in
      FIG. 13. As shown, the apparatus 1300 includes a fuel source 1302
      (e.g., gal, liquid, solid, etc.) which may create multiple flames
      1304. Ten flames 1304 are shown, but the number is non-limiting,
      and may even include only a single flame in some embodiments. An
      electrode, such as the sheathed wire electrode of FIGs. 11A and 1
      IB may be oriented as indicated at 1306 (i.e., with the electrode
      oriented into and out of the page) and may be moved in the
      direction indicated by arrow 1308 across the flames. The electrode
      may be connected to a current source (AC or DC) of any suitable
      potential (e.g., greater than 5kV in some non-limiting
      embodiments). Moving the electrode in the direction shown may
      deflect the flames and may extinguish the flames in some
      embodiments (e.g., with an oscillating signal of approximately 1
      kHz and electric potential greater than 30 kV, as non-limiting
      examples). The closer the electrode is to the origin of the
      flames, the greater the likelihood of extinguishing the flames.
      For example, positioning the electrode within approximately 1 cm
      of the flame origin may increase the likelihood of extinguishing
      the flames.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that various types of
      manipulation of flames using electric fields may be achieved. In
      some non-limiting embodiments, the electric fields may be
      oscillating electric fields having a gradient in three dimensions
      (referred to herein as "three-dimensional gradient fields"). In
      some embodiments, the electric fields are generated using fewer
      than three electrodes. The electrode(s) may be insulated to
      prevent generation of an ionic wind. Thus, the manipulation
      described according to various embodiments may be achieved without
      the need for an ionic wind. Various techniques for manipulating
      flames have been described. As mentioned previously, it should be
      appreciated that the various aspects described herein may be used
      individually or in any combination of two or more, unless
      otherwise stated.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned previously, one or more aspects of the present
      application may relate to manipulation of flames, and the
      manipulation may take one or more of various forms. Non-limiting
      examples of manipulation may include extinguishing a flame,
      suppressing a flame, bending a flame, controlling the mixing
      within the flame, and concentrating the flame However, other forms
      of manipulation may also be possible, and the various aspects
      described herein are not limited to any particular form of
      manipulation unless otherwise stated.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as mentioned previously, the aspects described herein may
      apply to various flame types (i.e., flames resulting from
      combustion of various types of fuels), unless otherwise stated.
      For example, ethanol, methanol, toluene, and hexane are
      non-limiting examples of fuel sources to which aspects of the
      present application may be applied. Other types of flames are also
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, various benefits may be realized by the application of
      one or more of the aspects described (though it should be
      appreciated that not all aspects necessarily provide each
      benefit). For example, one or more aspects may be used to put out
      a fire without the need for adding a suppressant (e.g., a chemical
      suppressant), which may reduce damage to items (e.g., personal and
      real property) as well as avoiding the need for toxic chemicals.
      In some embodiments, a fire may be put out from a distance.
      Moreover, manipulation of flames of different compositions may be
      achieved with the same technique of manipulation. Other aspects
      may provide improved combustion, e.g., more efficient combustion
      with the production of fewer combustion byproducts. Various other
      benefits, alternatively or in addition, may be realized by one or
      more aspects, as those listed are non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      One or more aspects and embodiments of the present application
      involving the performance of methods may utilize program
      instructions executable by a device (e.g., a computer, a
      processor, or other device) to perform, or control performance of,
      the methods. In this respect, various inventive concepts may be
      embodied as a computer readable storage medium (or multiple
      computer readable storage media) (e.g., a computer memory, one or
      more floppy discs, compact discs, optical discs, magnetic tapes,
      flash memories, circuit configurations in Field Programmable Gate
      Arrays or other semiconductor devices, or other tangible computer
      storage medium) encoded with one or more programs that, when
      executed on one or more computers or other processors, perform
      methods that implement one or more of the various embodiments
      discussed above. The computer readable medium or media can be
      transportable, such that the program or programs stored thereon
      can be loaded onto one or more different computers or other
      processors to implement various ones of the aspects discussed
      above. In some embodiments, computer readable media may be
      non-transitory media.<br>
      <br>
      Having thus described several aspects and embodiments of the
      technology, it is to be appreciated that various alterations,
      modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those
      skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and
      improvements are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the
      technology. <br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings provide
      non-limiting examples only.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the
      purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The
      use of "including," "comprising," or "having," "containing,"
      "involving," and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass
      the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as
      additional items.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Quantifying Flame Deflection</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to measure the angle of deflection, the flame is filmed
      during the application of the electric field using a digital
      camera at a frame rate of 1 fps. The frames are then superimposed
      on one another to create a composite, grayscale image as shown
      below.<br>
      <br>
      The angle of deflection is then measured by c<b>a</b>lculating the
      principle axes of "inertia" of the flame's image. First, the
      center of "mass" is calculated as<br>
      where My is the intensity of pixel (ij). The inertial tensor is
      then calculated as<br>
      <br>
      The eigenvectors of the inertial tensor represent the "principle
      axes" of the flame; the one of interest, v, points along the long
      axis of the flame. The angle of deflection is then calculated as
      [Theta] = tan&lt;"&gt;'(¦ vx Iv ¦).<br>
