      <div align="center"><big><b>Lonnie Johnson takes a different road
            to alternative energy</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by </b><br>

        <b>Marcia Wade Talbert</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>With a mind toward energy independence, President Barack
      Obama’s administration has made it a priority to put 1 million
      electric cars on the road in the next four years. Atlanta-based
      scientist Lonnie G. Johnson has been working toward that goal for
      nearly 20 years. In fact, he was trying to construct a device to
      produce alternative sources of energy when he unexpectedly
      invented the Super Soaker water gun in 1989.<br>
      <br>
      But Johnson, a former NASA scientist with a bachelor’s degree in
      mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in nuclear
      engineering, hopes his legacy will stand for something far more
      important than a children’s toy. He has put much of the money he
      made from the Super Soaker into two projects: the lithium air
      battery and the JTEC (Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter)
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The lithium air battery reacts to oxygen from its surroundings
      instead of reacting to corrosive metal materials that are stored
      inside traditional batteries. It is lighter than conventional
      battery cathode materials and lasts longer since oxygen is an
      unlimited reactant. Last year Johnson and his team became the
      first researchers to use a rechargeable lithium air battery to
      power a device. They started small by powering a remote control
      car—a suitable choice since the objective is to one day power
      electric vehicles. Johnson calls the lithium air battery “a game
      changer,” claiming it can power a vehicle for more than 1,000
      miles on a single charge. By comparison, the Chevy Volt has a
      16-kWh lithium-ion battery that lasts only 40 miles before it
      switches to its gas engine.<br>
      <br>
      “Lithium air is a very complicated technology. The great challenge
      for vehicle electrification—of getting people off of petroleum—is
      getting a battery that is powerful enough, cheap enough, and
      lightweight enough to rival gasoline in terms of its energy
      density,” says James Greenberger, executive director of the
      National Alliance of Advanced Technology Batteries. “Lonnie is
      unquestionably one of the leading scientific minds working on that
      problem.”<br>
      <br>
      Johnson’s other endeavor, the JTEC engine, which is still in the
      development phase, could potentially convert heat from the sun
      into electricity that is able to power entire cities, says
      Johnson. Popular Mechanics magazine awarded Johnson with the
      Breakthrough Award for the JTEC in 2008, and Paul Werbos, a
      program director at the National Science Foundation, believes that
      the engine could be worth trillions of dollars one day.<br>
      <br>
      Still, obtaining funding to advance both the JTEC and the lithium
      air battery has been a challenge. Johnson’s companies have
      received contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense and the
      Department of Energy to develop the two technologies, but the
      support has been insignificant considering the president’s goal
      toward energy independence, he says. “More emphasis needs to be
      placed on these particular technologies because they are in a
      class all by themselves.”<br>

      </b>The performance of conventional lithium battery systems is
      limited by the fundamental capacities of both the cathode and
      anode used in these batteries. The best cathode materials in
      lithium ion batteries have a specific capacity of less than
      200mAh/g. The most widely used anode material, graphitic or soft
      carbon, has a specific capacity of 372mAh/g. Metal/air batteries
      have a much larger specific energy than most of the available
      primary and rechargeable batteries. These batteries are unique in
      that the active cathode material (oxygen) is not stored in the
      battery. Oxygen from the environment is reduced at a catalytic air
      electrode surface forming either an oxide or peroxide ion that
      then reacts with cationic species in the electrolyte.Among various
      metal/oxygen batteries, Li/O2 couple is especially attractive
      because it has the potential of the highest specific energy
      (5,200Wh/kg) among all the known electrochemical couples.<br>
      <br>
      The specific energy of lithium air batteries is expected to be an
      order of magnitude larger than that achievable using conventional
      lithium or lithium ion batteries. Excellatron has expanded its
      technology base to lithium air batteries. Until now,
      commercialization of these batteries has been hindered by several
      problems such as corrosion and low capacity. The unique technology
      developed by Excellatron has overcome these problems and pushed
      Li/Air batteries closer to practical applications. Recently, we
      have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a rechargeable
      lithium/oxygen battery, and Li/Air demonstration samples have been
      successfully delivered to a customer.<br>

      <b>Advantages</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Metal/air batteries have a much higher gravimetric energy density
      than most available primary and rechargeable batteries.&nbsp;
      These batteries are unique in that the cathode active material is
      not stored in the battery.&nbsp; Oxygen from the environment is
      reduced at a catalytic air electrode surface forming either an
      oxide or peroxide ion that then reacts with cationic species in
      the electrolyte, metal air batteries have a much higher
      gravimetric energy density than that achieved by metal
      oxide/carbon couples.&nbsp; The Li/O2 couple is especially
      attractive because it has the potential for the highest
      gravimetric energy density (11,238 Wh/kg exclude oxygen and 5,200
      Wh/kg include oxygen) among all the known electrochemical
      couples.&nbsp; Even considering a 50% weight contribution from
      other inactive materials (including the cathode, separator,
      electrolyte, and packaging), the gravimetric energy density of the
      lithium air battery is still much larger than that achievable
      using conventional lithium or lithium ion batteries. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications &amp; Products</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The electrochemical coupling of a reactive anode to an air
      electrode provides a battery with an inexhaustible cathode and,
      potentially, very high specific energy and energy density.&nbsp;
      The most important advantage of a metal/air battery is that its
      active cathode, oxygen, is not carried inside of the
      battery.&nbsp; Instead, oxygen is extracted from the surrounding
      ambient environment when it is used.&nbsp; This unique property of
      metal/air batteries results in a huge advantage in their specific
      energy (Wh/kg) that is critical for applications that are very
      sensitive to weight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      Known for &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Super Soaker<br>
      <br>
      Lonnie George Johnson (born October 6, 1949 in Mobile, Alabama) is
      an American engineer. Johnson invented the Super Soaker water gun,
      which was the top selling toy in the United States in 1991 and
      1992.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Engineering firms</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1980 Johnson formed his own law firm and licensed the Super
      Soaker water gun to Larami Corporation. Two years later the Super
      Soaker generated over $200 million in retail sales and became the
      best selling toy in America. Larami Corporation was eventually
      purchased by Hasbro, the second largest toy manufacturer in the
      world. Over the years, Super Soaker sales have totaled close to
      one billion dollars. Johnson reinvested a majority of his earnings
      from the Super Soaker into research and development for his energy
      technology companies - "It's who I am, it's what I do."[2]
      Currently, Johnson holds over 80 patents, with over 20 more
      pending, and is the author of several publications on spacecraft
      power systems.[3][4]<br>
      Energy technology<br>
      <br>
      Two of Johnson’s companies, Excellatron Solid State and Johnson
      Electro-Mechanical Systems (JEMS), are developing energy
      technology. Excellatron is introducing thin film batteries, a new
      generation of rechargeable battery technology. JEMS has developed
      the Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter System (JTEC), listed
      by Popular Mechanics as one of the top 10 inventions of 2009. JTEC
      has potential applications in solar power plants and ocean thermal
      power generation. It converts thermal energy to electrical energy
      using a non-steam process which works by pushing hydrogen ions
      through two membranes, with significant advantages over
      alternative systems.[5][6]<br>

      and/or lithium carbon lanthanum zirconium oxide. A solid state
      composite separator contains an electronically insulating
      inorganic powder dispersed in an amorphous, inorganic, ionically
      conductive metal oxide. Methods for preparing the composite
      cathode and composite separator are provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] A battery cell is a particularly useful article that
      provides stored electrical energy which can be used to energize a
      multitude of devices, including portable devices that require an
      electrical power source. A battery cell, which is often referred
      to, somewhat inaccurately, in an abbreviated form as a "battery,"
      is an electrochemical apparatus typically formed from at least one
      electrolyte (also referred to as an "electrolytic conductor")
      disposed between a pair of spaced apart electrodes. The electrodes
      and electrolyte are the reactants for an electrochemical reaction
      that causes an electric current to flow between the electrodes
      when respective current collectors in contact with the electrodes
      are connected to an external circuit containing an object or
      device (generally referred to as the "load") to be powered. The
      flow of electrons through the free ends of the electrodes is
      accompanied and caused by the creation and flow of ions in and
      through the electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Typically, battery performance is enhanced by improving
      upon one or more of the individual components, such as the
      electrodes and/or electrolyte, and/or improving the interaction
      between or among the components of the battery. Materials that
      serve as electrolytes may have several different forms. For
      example, an electrolyte material may be a liquid, a solid, or a
      material such as a paste that has characteristics of both a liquid
      and a solid. In addition to electrodes and electrolyte, batteries
      may also contain a separator component, which separates the
      electrodes from one another. Separation of the electrodes prevents
      the undesirable conduction of electrons directly between the
      electrodes, called short circuiting. Typically, some type of solid
      material that is capable of creating and maintaining physical
      spacing between electrodes is used as a separator.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In recent years, much consideration has been given to
      so-called "solid-state" batteries, in which no liquids are
      employed in the electrodes or electrolyte. In solid-state
      batteries, the functions of separating electrodes (separator
      function) and of serving as a medium for the conduction of ions
      between electrodes (electrolyte function) are carried out by a
      single component. Thus, a solid ionically conductive electrolyte
      often serves as both a separator and as an electrolytic conductor.
      Very recently, solid ionically conductive materials, such as
      ionically conductive metal oxides, and amorphous ionically
      conductive metal oxides in particular, have been investigated for
      use as solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries. However, some
      solid ionically conductive materials have flaws, such as cracks in
      the material, which may adversely impact battery performance.
      Solid ionically conductive materials are often produced from
      precursors via a process that may cause cracks to be formed in the
      final product. Such cracks may inhibit the optimum transport of
      ions through the solid electrolyte. In addition, cracks may
      provide pathways for the transport of electrons between
      electrodes, thereby producing short- circuits that may cause the
      cell to fail. Thus, it can be appreciated that it would be useful
      to develop a solid ionically conductive electrolyte, suitable for
      use in solid-state batteries, in which flaws are sufficiently
      diminished or eliminated and cell performance is enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Thin film sputtered cathode materials are currently being
      used in state of the art thin film solid-state lithium and lithium
      ion batteries. Because lithium atoms generally have low diffusion
      coefficients in active cathode materials, the capacity of thick
      layer cathodes can only be shallowly, not fully, accessed during
      charge/discharge cycles of the battery. As a result, lithium ions
      can only move a limited distance from their entrance point into
      the cathode material at reasonable charge discharge rates. This
      shallow access dramatically reduces the volumetric and gravimetric
      energy density of the resulting batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Current thin film solid-state lithium-ion battery
      technology employs expensive substrates, including noble metals,
      and uses expensive sputtering processes to form the cathode
      material coatings. Despite high cost, high temperature-stable
      noble metals, such as gold, are utilized to retain the electronic
      conductivity of the current collectors required in such cells
      under the high temperature (&gt;850[deg.]C) procedures used to
      crystallize films and/or layers of the cathode materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Accordingly, cost effective solid-state lithium batteries
      containing high capacity cathodes are highly desirable.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b>¦</b><b><br>
      </b>0020] The invention is directed to a high capacity solid state
      composite cathode, a high capacity solid-state rechargeable
      lithium battery containing the cathode, and methods for their
      manufacture. The invention is also directed to a composite solid
      separator or electrolyte containing a solid ionically conductive
      material, a high capacity solid state rechargeable lithium battery
      containing the separator, and methods for their manufacture. The
      term '"battery" technically refers to a combination of two or more
      cells, but is commonly used to refer to a single cell.
      Accordingly, for the purposes of this disclosure, the term
      "battery" refers to both a single cell and a battery containing
      multiple cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The hereby disclosed invention and process apply
      particularly to oxide electrodes in lithium and lithium ion
      batteries which are mostly applied as cathodes, although there are
      examples of oxide anodes, such as lithium titanium oxide (LTO).
      Thus, for the purposes of this disclosure, the term "cathode" may
      be understood to refer not only to a cathode per se, but also to
      any active oxide electrode, even if it is used as an anode in a
      battery due to its low voltage. Additionally, although lithium
      batteries contain an anode made of pure lithium and lithium ion
      batteries contain an anode made of lithium-containing material,
      the terms "lithium battery" and "lithium ion battery" are used
      interchangeably in this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solid State Composite Cathode</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] The high capacity solid state composite cathode according
      to the invention comprises a an active cathode material dispersed
      in an amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal oxide. The
      active cathode material (powder), such as, for example, LiCo0 2 or
      LiNio 33Coo.33Mno.33O2 (NCM), has preferably been treated to
      remove passivating surface impurities or coatings (films).
      Preferred amorphous inorganic ionically conductive materials
      include lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) and/or amorphous
      lithium carbon lanthanum zirconium oxide (LCLZO). Optionally, the
      cathode further comprises an electronically conductive material,
      such as carbon black or carbon nanotubes, dispersed in the
      amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal oxide. As described
      in more detail below, the cathode is preferably formed by
      combining the active cathode material, precursors of the amorphous
      inorganic ionically conductive metal oxide, and optionally
      electronically conductive material, to form a slurry, and forming
      a film from the slurry, such as by casting. A heating and curing
      process converts the precursors into the amorphous material having
      the cathode active material dispersed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] When used to form a battery, the film may be cast from the
      slurry as a layer on a thin electronically conductive substrate,
      such as a metal foil, to serve as the current collector. The
      amorphous ionically conductive material will then function as both
      the electrolyte and the binder.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The active cathode material component of the composite
      cathode structure is prepared from a commercially available active
      cathode powder, such as LiCo0 2or NCM, commercially available from
      Pred Materials International (New York, NY). Other oxide active
      intercalation material powders known in the art or to be developed
      for use in lithium or lithium ion batteries would also be
      appropriate. The commercial powder is preferably washed in alcohol
      (such as isopropanol, for example) and dried by heating at about
      200 to 650[deg.]C for about two hours in an oxygen atmosphere,
      ozone-rich air or air. Such treatment results in a material which
      is at least substantially free of surface impurities.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It has been found that commercially available cathode
      powders have reacted with moisture in the air, resulting in the
      formation of thin passivating layers, such as lithium carbonate,
      lithium hydroxide, and/or lithium oxide, on the surface of the
      cathode materials. These thin passivating layers (typically much
      less than 1 micron in thickness) have high impedance, and act as a
      barrier to the passage of lithium ions. Accordingly, it has been
      found that treating commercially available cathode powders to
      remove the surface impurities results in a superior battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The second component of the composite cathode preferably
      contains amorphous LLZO and/or LCLZO, which provides high ionic
      conductivity to the cathode and serves as the cathode binder.
      These materials are described in United States Patent Application
      Publications Nos. 2011/0053001 and 2012/0196189, the disclosures
      of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety .
      These application publications are hereinafter referred to as "the
      &lt;v&gt;001 application publication" and "the [Iota] 89
      application publication," respectively. For the purposes of this
      disclosure, the term "LLZO" may be understood to refer to LLZO
      and/or LCLZO. It is also within the scope of the invention to
      utilize alternative amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal
      oxides instead of or in addition to the LLZO. For example,
      appropriate amorphous inorganic materials are those in which one
      or more of the elements in LLZO has been partially or completely
      replaced by a different element, such as replacing zirconium with
      tantalum. Such alternative materials are also described in the
      '001 and [Iota]89 application publications and all of the
      materials described therein are also within the scope of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The inorganic metal oxide, such as the preferred amorphous
      LLZO/LCLZO, is preferably combined with the cathode material as
      precursors, that is, compounds of lanthanum, lithium, and
      zirconium. Preferably, a precursor solution of such compounds
      which may be preferably applied by sol gel techniques is employed.
      For example, appropriate precursor solutions for LLZO and LCLZO
      are described in detail in the '001 and ' 189 application
      publications, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by
      reference in their entirety. In a preferred embodiment, the
      solution of precursors contains a lanthanum alkoxide, a lithium
      alkoxide, and a zirconium alkoxide dissolved in a solvent, such as
      an alcohol. Preferred precursors include lithium butoxide,
      lanthanum methoxyethoxide, and zirconium butoxide, and a preferred
      solvent is methoxyethanol. These precursor components are
      exemplary, not limiting, and alternative precursor solutions arc
      also within the scope of the invention, provided that they contain
      the required lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen components
      in appropriate concentrations. It is also within the scope of the
      invention to prepare more than one solution, such as three
      solutions each containing one o f the desired lithium, lanthanum,
      or zirconium compounds. If an amorphous metal oxide other than or
      in addition to the preferred LLZO/LCLZO is to be contained in the
      final cathode, the appropriate precursor solution(s) should
      contain the desired components in appropriate concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In a preferred embodiment, the composite cathode also
      contains an electronically conductive material and/or at least one
      additional ionically conductive material in powder form. Such
      materials are also combined with the active cathode material and
      amorphous material precursor and will be dispersed in the
      amorphous material after casting, for example, and heating
      (curing). Exemplary electronically conductive materials comprise
      carbon, preferably commercially available standard acetylene
      black, carbon nanotubes, or a mixture thereof. The ionically
      conductive powder may be a single material or a combination of
      materials. Examples of suitable ionically conductive powders
      include, but are not limited to, lithium aluminum germanium
      phosphate (LAGP), lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP),
      LLZO/LCLZO, or lithium lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO). Thus, in a
      preferred embodiment, two forms of LLZO may be used to produce the
      composite cathode: fully formed LLZO powder (amorphous or
      crystalline) and a LLZO precursor solution which will become
      amorphous LLZO after casting and curing. ¦0029] A preferred
      composite cathode is formed from a slurry that contains about 3g
      of NCM, about 3 ml LLZO sol gel precursor solution (as described
      in the '001 and [Iota] 89 application publications), about 0.75 g
      of LAGP, and about 0.02 g of acetylene black. More generally, the
      solids portion of the slurry preferably comprises about 80 to 100%
      cathode powder, about 0 to 30% LAGP, and about 0 to 3% carbon, all
      percentages being by weight. The ratio of the liquid portion (LLZO
      sol gel precursor solution) to the solid portion of the slurry is
      preferably about 75 to 200% (in milliliters) liquid to about 100%
      (by weight in grams) solids.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The term "slurry" may be understood to encompass materials
      having a range of viscosity, and may include a damp powder, a
      thick paste, a thin paste, a free flowing material, a thick
      liquid, a thin liquid, etc. After combining the active material
      with a solution containing the precursor compounds, the majority
      of the solvent may be evaporated to concentrate the slurry into
      the form of a thicker material, such as a paste. It is also within
      the scope of the invention to combine the precursor compounds with
      the active material (and optionally additional components, as
      previously described) using only a minimal amount of solvent
      necessary for mixing of the components.<br>
      <br>
      [0031 J The components of the cathode slurry may be mixed or
      energy milled in an inert environment to obtain a homogeneous
      mixture and then formed into a film, such as by casting or
      calendaring using known techniques. The method of mixing the
      components is not critical and may be determined or adjusted by
      routine experimentation. The film, which may also be referred to
      as a sheet or wafer, may be thick or thin, and may have a
      thickness of about 1 micron to about 1 mm. When the slurry is in
      the form of a thick paste or damp powder, for example, the film
      may also be formed by compacting or pressing it into a rigid or
      semi-rigid structure, such as a sheet or wafer, using a press or
      other device which applies pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] When preparing a battery, the film may be cast or
      calendered onto a thin electronically conductive substrate,
      preferably an inexpensive thin metal foil substrate, as a coating
      or layer. The substrate, which will serve as a current collector
      in the battery, preferably has a thickness of about 5 microns to
      about 50 microns, more preferably about 5 microns to about 30
      microns. A preferred substrate is aluminum foil. It is within the
      scope of the invention to utilize other substrates, including
      other metal substrates, such as nickel foil, in place of aluminum,
      provided that they provide the same advantages. Specifically,
      other flexible foils exhibiting high electronic conductivity, such
      as metalized non-metal foils, composite foils, and other foils
      known in the art or to be developed which have similar properties
      are also within the scope of the invention. Preferably the coating
      composition is coated on the substrate to form a layer having a
      thickness of about 5 to 50 microns. [0033J Finally, as described
      in more detail below, the film (which may be self-supporting or
      supported on a substrate) is heated (cured) to convert the
      precursors into the amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal
      oxide having the active material (and optional additional
      components) dispersed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It is also within the scope of the invention to include
      additional layers in the cathode. For example, multiple layers of
      cathode composition, such as from the slurry as described above,
      having a thickness of about 5 to about 50 microns may be applied
      to the cathode film. Additionally, one or more compacting steps or
      calendering steps may be performed after application of the
      materials onto the substrate to facilitate the formation of a
      smooth surface battery. One or more layers of LLZO (deposited by
      sol-gel techniques from a precursor solution) may also be applied
      onto the composite cathode to further increase the ionic
      conductivity. Advantageously, the cathode according to the
      invention is formed using only low temperatures processing (up to
      about 350[deg.]C). Solid State Battery<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A high capacity rechargeable lithium solid state battery
      according to an embodiment of the invention contains, in addition
      to the previously described cathode, a thin solid electrolyte,
      such as amorphous LLZO and/or lithium phosphorus oxynitride
      (LiPON), and/or a thick solid electrolyte, such as an amorphous
      LLZO based-composite separator, either of which (or their
      combination) is deposited onto the previously described cathode,
      and a lithium-based anode, such as a metal current collector,
      silicon, lithium, a lithium alloy, or lithium titanium oxide
      (LTO). Other battery parts well known in the art may also be
      included, such as current collectors) and outside casing. If only
      a metal current collector, such as a copper film, is utilized, the
      lithium anode will be formed upon initial charging of the battery
      as lithium is plated between the current collector and the
      separator. Thus, both lithium and lithium-ion batteries are within
      the scope of the invention. During synthesis of the battery,
      processing is performed at low temperatures (up to about
      350[deg.]C), which further reduces the cost of the battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Additionally, the invention is directed to a solid state
      lithium or lithium ion battery comprising a composite solid state
      anode, a cathode, and a separator, in which the composite solid
      state anode is as described previously. In other words, solid
      state lithium or lithium ion batteries according to the invention
      comprises a composite solid state electrode according to the
      invention, a counter electrode, and a separator.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As previously explained, when forming the batteries
      according to the invention, the composite electrode may be cast or
      applied directly onto an electronically conductive substrate
      serving as a current collector. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] A schematic of an exemplary solid state lithium battery
      according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 1. As
      shown in Fig. 1, a portion of the lithium battery 1 contains a
      composite cathode 2 containing cathode powder, LLZO, and
      optionally carbon, a separator 4, and a lithium-based anode 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Also within the scope of the invention are complex two
      battery cell structures containing a single cathode current
      collector (thin metal foil substrate) and complete cells
      constructed on both sides of the substrate, as shown in Fig. 2. As
      shown in Fig. 2, a lithium battery 8 contains an aluminum foil
      current collector 16 sandwiched between two composite cathodes 14,
      two solid state separators 12, and two lithium anodes 10. A copper
      current collector 18 is present on the external surface of one of
      the lithium anodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Solid state lithium batteries according to the invention
      exhibit high capacity during cycling by deep harvesting the active
      cathode material due to the presence of a highly conducting
      LLZO/LCLZO or analogous network in the cathode structure. In
      addition to providing an enhanced ion conduction network in the
      cathode structure to facilitate this deep accessing of the active
      cathode materia!, LLZO or analogous material also binds the
      cathode material, providing structural integrity to the cathode
      without requiring high temperature sintering or any other high
      temperature processing step.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The batteries of the invention thus provide numerous
      advantages relative to prior art batteries, including high
      capacity, deep access of the cathode, low cost, low temperature
      processing, smooth surface cathodes (leading to better uniformity
      and coverage by the solid electrolyte separator film), and the
      ability to scale up to large size batteries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cathode and Battery Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] The methods for producing the cathode and battery according
      to the invention preferably involve at least the following steps,
      which will be described in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      However, some of these steps, while preferred, are not critical,
      and other steps may be combined or modified based on routine
      experimentation. The method steps include:<br>
      <br>
      (1) preparing an active cathode material substantially free from
      surface impurities;<br>
      <br>
      (2) preparing precursor compounds for an amorphous inorganic
      ionically conductive metal oxide, such as an LLZO/LCLZO precursor
      solution;<br>
      <br>
      (3) preparing a slurry containing the active cathode material and
      the precursor compounds;<br>
      <br>
      (4) forming a film from the slurry;<br>
      <br>
      (5) exposing the film to ozone-rich, low humidity air,<br>
      <br>
      (6) heating the film at about 70 to 130[deg.]C in ozone-rich, low
      humidity air,<br>
      <br>
      (7) heating the film at about 280 to 350[deg.]C in low humidity
      air to form a cathode; <br>
      <br>
      (8) depositing a solid electrolyte separator layer on the cathode;
      and<br>
      <br>
      (9) depositing a lithium-based anode on the electrolyte layer to
      form the battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Importantly, at least steps (4) to (6) are preferably
      performed in an ozone-rich, low humidity environment. The term
      "ozone-rich" refers to an environment containing at least about
      0.05 ppm ozone and the term "low humidity" describes an
      environment having less than about 30 percent relative humidity
      (RH).<br>
      <br>
      <b>(1) Active Cathode Material Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [004 1 The first step in the method of the invention involves
      preparing an active cathode material or powder that is preferably
      substantially free from passivating surface films (surface
      impurities). The material is prepared from a commercially
      available cathode powder, such as L1C0O2 or NCM, available from
      Pred Materials International (New York, NY). Other oxide active
      intercalation material powders known in the art or to be developed
      for use in lithium or lithium ion batteries would also be
      appropriate. The powder is first washed in alcohol (such as
      isopropanol, for example) and dried by heating at about 200 to
      650[deg.]C for about two hours in an oxy gen atmosphere,
      ozone-rich air, or air. The isopropanol washing is preferably
      performed by placing the cathode active powder in a pan, pouring
      the alcohol over the powder until all of the powder has been
      submerged in the liquid, briefly mixing the powder in the liquid,
      pouring off the excess liquid, and placing the wet powder in a
      furnace for the heating step.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As previously explained, it has been found that treating
      commercially available cathode powders to remove the passivating
      surface impurities, such as lithium carbonate, lithium oxide, and
      lithium hydroxide, which act as a high impedance barrier, results
      in a superior battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The active intercalation material is preferably NCM or
      LiCo0 2. However, other oxide electrode materials may also be used
      to form a composite solid state electrode according to the
      invention. For example, LTO is an oxide intercalation material
      that is generally considered to be an anode material due to its
      low voltage. Accordingly, LTO powder may also be used as an active
      material to form a composite solid state electrode in the same
      manner as described for the formation of a solid state cathode.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Amorphous Ionically Conductive Material Precursor Solution
      Preparation<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The second step in the method involves preparing precursor
      compounds for the amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal
      oxide, preferably a solution of such precursors.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the step involves preparing a solution
      of LLZO/LCLZO precursors, namely, compounds containing lanthanum,
      lithium, and zirconium which may be preferably applied by sol gel
      techniques. For example, appropriate precursor solutions for LLZO
      and LCLZO are described in detail in the '001 and ' 189
      application publications. In a preferred embodiment, the solution
      contains a lanthanum alkoxide, a lithium alkoxide, and a zirconium
      alkoxide dissolved in a solvent, such as an alcohol. Preferred
      precursors include lithium butoxide, lanthanum methoxyethoxide,
      and zirconium butoxide, and a preferred solvent is methoxyethanol.
      These precursor components are exemplary, not limiting, and
      alternative precursor solutions for LLZO/LCLZO are also within the
      scope of the invention, provided that they contain the required
      lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen components in
      appropriate concentrations. It is also within the scope of the
      invention to prepare more than one solution, such as three
      solutions each containing one of the desired lithium, lanthanum,
      or zirconium components. If an amorphous material other than or in
      addition to LLZO/LCLZO is to be contained in the final cathode,
      the appropriate precursor solution(s) should contain the desired
      components in appropriate concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The precursor solution may be prepared by mixing the
      components in any sequence at room temperature. Preferably, the
      thoroughly-mixed precursor solution is maintained in an inert en
      vironment for about one to 1.5 hours to help facilitate
      substantially complete dissolution of the components. An "inert
      environment" may be understood to refer to a nitrogen or argon
      environment in which the moisture is low enough that lithium
      components are not degraded due to moisture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(3) Slurry Preparation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] After preparing the precursor compounds and active cathode
      material, the next step in the method involves forming a slurry
      containing these components. The slurry may be simply prepared by
      combining appropriate amounts of solution and active material and
      mixing, such as by energy milling in an airtight jar for about 60
      to about 100 minutes, or until the resulting mixture is
      homogeneous by visible inspection. However, such a method of
      slurry preparation is by no means limiting and any appropriate
      method of mixing and slurry preparation is also within the scope
      of the invention. As previously explained, the slurry is
      preferably prepared in an inert (nitrogen or argon filled)
      environment. In a preferred embodiment, no additional solvent is
      added to form the slurry other than the solvent present in the
      precursor solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Each of the slurry components will play a distinct role in
      the final cathode. Specifically, the active cathode material
      intercalates lithium, and the precursors to LLZO/LCLZO or similar
      material functions as an ionically conductive component and, after
      curing, as a solid electrolyte and as a binder for the cathode.
      [0051] In a preferred embodiment, the slurry contains a third
      component, which provides electronic conductivity to the cathode.
      This component is a carbon material, such as the preferred
      commercially available standard acetylene black and/or carbon
      nanotubes, although other carbon materials which would provide the
      same function would also be appropriate. It is also within the
      scope of the invention to include more than one type of
      electronically conductive material. When carbon is included in the
      slurry, it may be necessary to add additional solvent in order to
      facilitate the formation of a homogeneous suspension. The added
      solvent is preferably the same solvent contained in the precursor
      solution, such as the preferred methoxyethanol. The amounts of
      carbon (and optionally solvent) to be added may be determined by
      routine experimentation in order to maintain the same viscosity of
      the suspension<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Additionally, it is also within the scope of the invention
      to include an additional powder in the slurry to further improve
      the ionic conductivity. Such additional powders may- include, for
      example, LATP (lithium aluminum titanium phosphate), LAGP (lithium
      aluminum germanium phosphate), LLZO/LCLZO powder, or another
      oxide/phosphate based ionically conductive powder. It may be
      advantageous to replace some of the precursor solution, such as
      the preferred LLZO/LCLZO precursor solution, with one or more of
      these powders to increase the ionic conductivity, yield a compact
      structure, and reduce the drying time needed due to the decrease
      in the amount of solvent present from the precursor solution.
      Thus, in a preferred embodiment, LLZO is present in two forms in
      the cathode slurry: a fully formed LLZO powder (amorphous or
      crystalline) and a LLZO precursor solution which will become
      amorphous LLZO after casting and curing.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A preferred slurry contains about 3 g of NCM, about 3 ml
      LLZO precursor solution (as described in the '001 application
      publication), about 0.75 g of LAGP and about 0.02 g of acetylene
      black. More generally, the solids portion of the slurry preferably
      comprises about 80 to 100% cathode powder, about 0 to 30% LAGP,
      and about 0 to 3% carbon, all percentages being by weight. The
      ratio of the liquid portion (LLZO precursor solution) to the solid
      portion of the slurry is preferably about 75 to 200% (in
      milliliters) liquid to about 100% (by weight in grams) solids.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The term "slurry" may be understood to encompass materials
      having a range of viscosity, and may include a damp powder, a
      thick paste, a thin paste, a free flowing material, a thick
      liquid, a thin liquid, etc. After combining the active material
      with a solution containing the precursor compounds, the majority
      of the solvent may be evaporated to concentrate the slurry into
      the form of a thicker material, such as a paste. It is also within
      the scope of the invention to combine the precursor compounds with
      the active material (and optionally additional components, as
      previously described) using only a minimal amount of solvent
      necessary for mixing of the components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(4) Forming a Film</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0055] The next step in the method involves forming a film from
      the slurry, such as by casting or calendering. The film preferably
      has a thickness of about 1 micron to about 1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It is within the scope of the invention to form a film that
      will be self-supporting and free standing, or to form a film from
      the slurry on a substrate, preferably a thin, electronically
      conductive substrate such as the preferred thin aluminum foil
      substrate, to form a layer or coating. Aluminum has several
      advantages, including being light weight and inexpensive, in
      contrast with more expensive metal substrates utilized in
      traditional batteries. The aluminum foil or other substrate
      preferably has a thickness of about 5 microns to about 50 microns,
      more preferably about 5 microns to about 30 microns. It is within
      the scope of the invention to utilize other substrates, such as
      other metal and non-metal electronically conductive substrates,
      including nickel foil, in place of aluminum, as long as they
      provide the same advantages and can withstand the curing
      processing temperature and environment. Preferably, the metal foil
      is cleaned prior to casting, such as by wiping with alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The casting is preferably performed by tape casting on a
      standard flat casting table. The method of tape casting is well
      known in the art and need not be described. Appropriate conditions
      for the tape casting are known in the art or may be determined by
      routine experimentation. The casting is preferably performed in an
      ozone-rich and low humidity environment, as previously described.
      The slurry may also be applied by other means, such as
      calendering, using known techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Additionally, if the slurry is relatively viscous, such as
      a thick paste or damp powder, a film may be formed by compacting
      the slurry, such as under pressure with a press or other device
      known in the art, to form a rigid or semi-rigid structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(5) - (7) Forming the Cathode</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0059] After film forming, the film is preferably exposed to low
      humidity, ozone-rich air, such as for about one hour, heated at
      about 70 to 130[deg.]C in ozone-rich, low humidity air, such as
      for about one hour, and then heated at about 280 to 350[deg.]C in
      low humidity air, such as for about one hour to form a cathode.
      More preferably, the first heating step is performed at about 75
      to 90[deg.]C, more preferably about 80[deg.]C, and the second
      heating step preferably performed at about 300 to about
      310[deg.]C. The specific drying and heating times and temperatures
      may be varied, but are preferably performed at no higher than
      about 350[deg.]C. It is also within the scope of the invention to
      omit the first exposure step and proceed with the two heating
      steps after casting. After these heating steps, the cathode is now
      complete.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Importantly, the lower temperature heating is preferably
      performed in an ozone-rich (containing at least about 0.05 ppm
      ozone) and low humidity (less than about 30 percent relative
      humidity) environment, and the higher temperature heating is
      performed in low humidity air. Without wishing to be bound by
      theory, it is believed that the lower temperature heating gently
      evaporates the alcohol components from the precursor solution
      without destroying the soft and sensitive structure of the solid
      material. Subsequently, the higher temperature heating step serves
      to solidify the active material in the amorphous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] It is also within the scope of the invention to perform
      additional steps during production of the cathode. For example,
      after film forming and before heating, in a preferred embodiment,
      a layer or film of LLZO precursor solution may be spin coated onto
      the cast film. Upon subsequent heating to about 70 to 130[deg.]C
      and drying at about 280 to 350[deg.]C. this additional LLZO layer
      helps to improve the ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity
      of the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] It is also within the scope of the invention to perform a
      compacting step to compact the film. If compacting is performed,
      it is preferably performed after the lower temperature heating
      step but before the higher temperature heating step. It has been
      found that after heating to about 350[deg.]C, an amorphous solid
      material has been formed, and compacting is not possible without
      cracking of the material. Compacting may be performed by any
      method known in the art, such as calendering, and may be performed
      in an inert or low humidity environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] If compacting is performed, it is also within the scope of
      the invention to subsequently spin coat an additional layer of
      amorphous inorganic ionically conductive metal oxide, such as an
      LLZO/LCLZO layer (from a precursor solution) onto the cathode,
      followed by two heating steps as previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the method comprises
      casting forming a film from the slurry, optionally applying a
      layer of amorphous LLZO/LCLZO from a precursor solution, drying at
      about 70-130[deg.]C, compacting the slurry and LLZO/LCLZO layer,
      and applying a second layer of LLZO/LCLZO from a sol-gel precursor
      solution and drying, followed by a final heating step at about
      280-350[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(8) Depositing Electrolyte Separator Layer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] To form a battery, a separator (electrolyte) layer is
      subsequently deposited onto the completed cathode, more preferably
      onto a completed cathode/current collector combination.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, the cathode may be formed directly on an
      electronically conductive substrate, such as a metal foil, which
      serves as the current collector. Alternatively, the cathode may be
      formed as a self-supporting, free-standing structure. If so, a
      current collector may be coated onto the cathode using known
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The specific electrolyte material used for the separator is
      not critical, and may be one known in the art or to be developed
      for solid-state batteries. In preferred embodiments, the
      electrolyte is preferably a layer of lithium phosphorus oxynitride
      (UPON), which may be vacuum sputtered to a thickness of about 1.5
      to 2 microns, or a layer of LLZO deposited from a sol-gel
      precursor solution to a thickness of 1-2 microns, exposed to low
      humidity, ozone-rich air, and heated at about 70-130[deg.]C and
      then at about 280-350[deg.]C as previously described. The
      separator may also be the composite separator described in more
      detail below. Other methods for depositing solid electrolyte
      separator materials on top of a solid cathode are well known in
      the art and need not be described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(9) Depositing Lithium Anode</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0067] Finally, a lithium-based anode (preferably about 2 microns
      in thickness) is deposited on the electrolyte (separator) layer to
      complete the solid-state battery. The anode may be any anode
      material known in the art or to be developed, such as a metal
      current collector, silicon, lithium, a lithium alloy, or lithium
      titanium oxide (LTO). If only a metal current collector, such as a
      copper film, is utilized, the lithium anode will be formed upon
      initial charging of the battery as lithium is plated between the
      current collector and the separator. Methods for depositing anode
      materials on top of a solid electrolyte are well known in the art
      and need not be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] According to the invention, high capacity solid-state
      batteries are achieved by deep accessing the cathode material,
      which is made possible by the presence of a highly ionically
      conducting network, such as an LLZO/LCLZO network, in the cathode
      structure. Processing of the cathode at low temperature (about
      350[deg.]C), compared with high temperature processed (sintered)
      cathodes, is enabled by utilizing a highly ionically conductive
      amorphous material, such as LLZO, as a binder. This low
      temperature processing helps reduce the cost of solid-state
      battery manufacturing. The use of inexpensive thin aluminum foil
      as a substrate in the battery, rather than expensive substrates
      such as gold, is also possible because of the low temperature
      processing. Finally, the ability to achieve a smooth cathode
      surface leads to better uniformity and coverage of the separator
      film. This method also allows scale up of the size of the battery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solid State Composite Separator</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0069] The solid state composite separator according to the
      invention is formed from a composite ionically conductive solid
      material. Because this ionically conductive solid material is
      capable of serving as both a separator and an electrolyte, it may
      be understood that the description of "separator" in this section
      also refers to an "electrolyte." The ionically conductive material
      is a composite comprising an inorganic powder dispersed in a
      binder of amorphous, inorganic, ionically conductive metal oxide,
      such as LLZO/LCLZO. To form a working battery, the separator is
      cast onto a cathode, which serves as a substrate for the
      separator. The presence of the inorganic powder increases the
      thickness of the layer of amorphous material, thus reducing
      defects induced by debris which are present in very thin films,
      and which destroy their functionality as separators. Thus, the
      presence of the inorganic powder increases the reliability of the
      amorphous material and provides a better separator material.
      Inorganic Powder<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A variety of inorganic powders, both amorphous and
      crystalline, are appropriate for use as the inorganic powder in
      the invention provided that the powder is an electronic insulator.
      Preferred powders include LLZO, which is ionically conductive, and
      aluminum oxide, which is non-conductive.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Other electronically insulating materials may also be used
      alone or in combination, provided that they bond well with the
      binder, described below. Exemplary non- conductive inorganic
      powders include, without limitation, inorganic single
      metal/multi-metal/non-metal oxides, carbides, phosphates, and
      nitrides, such as AI2O3, TiO?, ZnO, Si0 2, BaTiO^, L1AIO3, BC, BN,
      etc. Appropriate particle sizes may be selected based on routine
      experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] It is also within the scope of the invention to include an
      ionic ally -conductive inorganic powder in addition to or instead
      of the electronically insulating powders described above to
      enhance the ion-transport capability of the separator. While not
      required, inclusion of one or more ionically conductive inorganic
      powders is advantageous and a preferred embodiment of the
      invention. Exemplary ionically conductive inorganic powders
      include, for example, crystalline or amorphous LLZO. crystalline
      or amorphous LCLZO, lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP),
      lithium aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP) and lithium lanthanum
      titanium oxide (LLTO). The inorganic powders listed above are
      exemplary, not limiting, and it i s also within the scope of the
      invention to utilize other inorganic powder materials that are
      known in the art or to be developed which would provide the same
      benefits as the materials described herein. Appropriate particle
      sizes may be selected based on routine experimentation .<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ionically Conductive Metal Oxide</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] Presently preferred inorganic, amorphous, ionically
      conductive metal oxide materials include amorphous LLZO and
      amorphous LCLZO as previously described, that is, a solution
      containing precursor compounds. It is also within the scope of the
      invention to utilize alternative amorphous inorganic ionically
      conductive materials instead of or in addition to the LLZO. Other
      preferred materials are also amorphous, oxide-based compounds. For
      example, appropriate amorphous inorganic materials are those in
      which one or more of the elements in LLZO has been partially or
      completely replaced by a different element, such as replacing
      zirconium with tantalum, provided that the resulting material
      exhibits the desired properties. Such alternative materials are
      also described in the '001 and [Iota] 89 application publications
      and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      ¦0074] The ionically conductive material is preferably prepared
      from a sol gel precursor solution containing the desired elements,
      as previously described. Specifically, the preferred LLZO/LCLZO is
      preferably prepared from a solution containing compounds of
      lanthanum, lithium, and zirconium which may be preferably applied
      by sol gel techniques. For example, appropriate precursor
      solutions for LLZO and LCLZO are described in detail in the '001
      and ' 189 application publications. In a preferred embodiment, the
      solution contains a lanthanum alkoxide, a lithium alkoxide, and a
      zirconium alkoxide dissolved in a solvent, such as an alcohol.
      Preferred precursors include lithium butoxide, lanthanum
      methoxyethoxide, and zirconium butoxide, and a preferred solvent
      is methoxyethanol. These precursor components are exemplary, not
      limiting, and alternative precursor solutions are also within the
      scope of the invention, provided that they contain the required
      lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen components in
      appropriate concentrations. It is also within the scope of the
      invention to prepare more than one solution, such as three
      solutions each containing one of the desired lithium, lanthanum,
      or zirconium components. If an amorphous material other than or in
      addition to LLZO/LCLZO is to be contained in the final cathode,
      the appropriate precursor solution(s) should contain the desired
      components in appropriate concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Separator and Method of Formation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0075¦ The separator according to the invention may be formed by
      any known method for dispersing a powder into primary
      ingredient(s) or precursor(s) and for producing a substantially
      solid medium in which the particles of powder will be dispersed. A
      preferred method for producing the separator involves first
      creating a slurry by mixing together the inorganic powder with one
      or more liquid precursor(s) of the amorphous, inorganic ionically
      conducting material, then forming a film of the slurry. Finally,
      the film is subjected to a thermal curing process (heating)
      whereby the precursors are converted into the amorphous ionically
      conductive material. These steps are described in detail above
      with respect to the preparation of the composite cathode;
      differing only in the fact that the electronically insulating
      inorganic powder is used instead of the cathode active material
      and optional electronically conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] When LLZO or LCLZO is utilized as the amorphous ionically
      conductive metal oxide, the drying and curing process preferably
      involves two sequential heating steps that are performed in
      specific ozone and humidity atmospheres, as described previously.
      When alternative inorganic ionically conductive materials are
      utilized, appropriate slurry components and reaction conditions
      may be determined by routine experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      [00771 For forming a battery comprising the composite separator,
      the film from the slurry of inorganic pow &lt;!&gt;der and
      precursor of amorphous ionically conductive metal oxide is cast
      onto an electrode, typically a cathode, which serves as a
      substrate, and then dried and cured as previously described to
      form the composite separator on the electrode. Appropriate
      electrodes are well known in the art and need not be described.
      However, it is also within the scope of the invention to produce
      the separator as a free-standing, self-supporting structure by
      forming a self-supporting film from the slurry, as previously
      described with respect to the composite cathode. It is also within
      the scope of the invention to utilize the composite cathode
      according to an embodiment of the invention, described previously,
      in the battery. Subsequently, the battery may be produced from the
      separator/electrode combination using known methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In a composi te separator according to an embodiment of the
      invention, particles of electronically insulating inorganic powder
      are dispersed in a medium comprising an amorphous, inorganic,
      ionically conductive metal oxide serving as a binder for the
      powder. The dispersion of inorganic powder may be uniform or may
      be random and non-uniform without adversely affecting the
      effectiveness of the separator. The separator is a separator in
      the functional and traditional sense of serving to separate
      electrodes from one another; however, the separator is also an
      electrolyte (or electrolytic conductor) because it comprises
      predominantly ionically conductive material. The separator is
      substantially free of cracks because inorganic powder has been
      added to the amorphous, inorganic, ionically conductive metal
      oxide, which would typically be used alone to form a separator.
      The added inorganic powder changes the structural and chemical
      composition of the mixture of precursors for the amorphous,
      inorganic, ionically conductive metal oxide such that cracks are
      not typically formed during the process of forming the final
      product. Because the amorphous, inorganic material is ionically
      conductive, it serves the dual purpose of binder for the inorganic
      powder and electrolyte for the transport of ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The separator according to the invention is suitable for
      use in a cell (or battery) comprising a cathode and an anode
      separated by a separator. The invention is particularly suitable
      for use in a lithium battery, in which the lithium ions will be
      transported through the separator/electrolyte. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] This invention will now be described in connection with the
      following, non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1 : Preparation of Composite Cathode and Lithium
        Battery</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0081] A dried cathode material (NCM) (obtained from Pred
      Materials International (New York, NY)) was washed in isopropanol
      and dried at 200[deg.]C in an ozone-rich air environment for about
      two hours. A LLZO sol gel precursor solution was prepared by
      dissolving about 4.5 grams of a lanthanum methoxyethoxide solution
      (about 12% by weight in methoxyethanol), about 0.65 gram of
      lithium butoxide and about 0.77 gram of a zirconium butoxide
      solution (about 80% by weight in butanol) in about 5 grams of
      methoxyethanol (all chemicals obtained from Gelest, Inc.
      (Morrisville, PA) or Alfa Acsar). The thoroughly-mixed precursor
      solution was left in a bottle in an inert environment for about 1
      to 1.5 hours to help facilitate substantially complete dissolution
      of the lithium butoxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In an inert environment, a slurry was prepared by combining
      6 g of the dried cathode material, 1.2 g LAGP (electrolyte
      powder), 6 ml of the LLZO sol-gel precursor solution, and 0.03 g
      acetylene black (obtained from Alfa Aesar), and then energy milled
      for about 80 minutes in an airtight jar. A thin aluminum foil
      (approximately 50 [mu][eta][iota]) was cleaned using isopropanol,
      and the slurry was then cast onto the cleaned foil and exposed to
      an ozone-rich and low humidity air environment for about one hour.
      To the exposed cathode structure, more LLZO sol gel solution was
      infiltrated by spin coating and again exposed to ozone-rich and
      low humidity air environment for about one hour. Subsequently, the
      coated substrate was heated to 80[deg.]C for about one hour in the
      ozone-rich and low humidity air environment. Thereafter, it was
      calendered for compaction and surface smoothcning. To this, an
      extra layer of LLZO sol gel layer was spin-coated, exposed at
      ambient temperature for one hour and then heated at 80[deg.]C for
      one hour, all in the ozone-rich and low humidity air environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] To complete production of the cathode, the resulting
      structure was heated to 300[deg.]C in air for about one hour. On
      this novel cathode-separator combination, a thin layer of LiPON
      (1.5 - 2 micron thick) electrolyte was sputtered. Finally, an
      approximately 2-micron thick lithium anode was evaporated on the
      LiPON to complete the solid-state battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Analysis of the resulting low cost solid-state lithium
      battery demonstrated that high capacity was achieved and that deep
      cathode material was accessed during charge-discharge cycling.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Preparation of Composite Separator </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0085] Aluminum oxide powder from Sigma- Aldrich in the form of
      nanoparticles (size -60 nm) was dried at about 150[deg.]C under
      vacuum for about 24 h. About 2g of the dried A1 20 3powder was
      mixed with 2ml of LLZO sol gel precursor solution as described in
      Example 1 into an energy milling jar. The jar was air tight sealed
      in the inert environment and was energy milled for about 80 min. A
      45-micron thick aluminum foil was prepared by wiping with
      isopropanol and drying at about 80[deg.]C for about one hour. The
      homogeneously milled slurry was cast onto the clean and dried foil
      inside an ozone-rich (at least 0.05 ppm) and low humidity (less
      than about 30 percent relative humidity) air environment to form a
      sheet. The sheet was let to dry and cure for about one hour in the
      ozone-rich and low humidity air environment. Subsequently, the
      sheet was compacted using a clean roller inside the same air
      environment. Thereafter, one square inches pieces were cut from
      the sheet and further cured at about 80[deg.]C for about one hour
      in an ozone-rich and low humidity air environment. The pieces of
      the sheet were heated at 300[deg.]C for about one hour in air,
      thus forming a sample of composite separator.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The ionic conductivity of the composite separator pieces
      was measured using a Solectron Si 1260 Impedance Analyzer. The Al
      foil substrate served as one electrode for the measurement while
      the other electrode was formed by sputtered gold. The impedance
      spectrum of the composite separator sample (Fig. 3) demonstrates
      ionic conduction and a lack of short circuits.<br>

      An impregnated solid state composite cathode is provided. The
      cathode contains a sintered porous active material, in which pores
      of the porous material are impregnated with an inorganic ionically
      conductive amorphous solid electrolyte. A method for producing the
      impregnated solid state composite cathode involves forming a
      pellet containing an active intercalation cathode material;
      sintering the pellet to form a sintered porous cathode pellet;
      impregnating pores of the sintered porous cathode pellet with a
      liquid precursor of an inorganic amorphous ionically conductive
      solid electrolyte; and curing the impregnated pellet to yield the
      composite cathode.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Solid-state lithium batteries have recently garnered a
      great deal of attention due to their many advantages over
      batteries that use liquid electrolytes. Safety is a major issue
      with liquid electrolyte batteries and constrains the use of
      batteries in some applications, such as the car industry. Benefits
      of solid-state batteries include improved safety and longer life
      because they do not contain any combustible organics and can
      operate at high temperatures, if needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Some of the major drawbacks in solid-state battery
      development have included achieving high energy density and
      capacity, which are inhibited by factors such as thickness of the
      cathode, the percentage of the cathode that can be accessed during
      discharge, and the rate at which the cathode can be accessed. The
      percentage of the cathode that can be accessed during
      charge/discharge is limited because lithium atoms generally have
      low diffusion coefficients in active intercalation cathode
      materials, so that lithium ions can only move a very limited
      distance from their entrance point into the intercalation material
      during a given period of time. In order to access the full
      capacity of a thick cathode at reasonable charge and discharge
      rates, the cathode must be rich in lithium ion conducting pathways
      that are connected and stretch throughout the body of the cathode.
      This goal is easily achievable using an organic liquid electrolyte
      which fills the pores of the cathode, providing the desired ionic
      pathways, but at a significant safety risk. The ability to replace
      the liquid electrolyte with a chemically stable and safe solid
      electrolyte, while maintaining the same high access of the liquid
      electrolyte battery, has been one of the main objectives of all
      solid state battery development.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Active cathode materials are generally oxides or
      oxide-based materials, such as transition metal oxides, phosphates
      and silicates. Large solid structures of these materials are
      usually prepared by sintering the corresponding powders. It would
      be expected that sintering an active cathode powder with a lithium
      ionically conductive solid electrolyte powder would form a high
      access cathode structure. However, it has been found that
      sintering a cathode material with a solid electrolyte normally
      induces solid-state reactions between the cathode and electrolyte,
      and may result in electrochemical deactivation of the interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Many attempts have been made to develop and commercialize
      solid-state lithium batteries with high access, capacity, and
      energy density. For example, Nagata and Nanno {Journal of Power
      Sources; 174; 832-837 (2007)) attempted to eliminate the
      solid-state reaction between cathode and electrolyte and the
      resulting deactivation of the interface by utilizing lithium
      aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP) as an electrolyte and lithium
      iron phosphate or lithium cobalt phosphate as an cathode active
      material. They were able to sinter the two materials without
      observing any significant additional new material phase at the
      interface between the cathode and electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      However, in this method, the active cathode material was not
      sintered to itself to form excellent electrical conductivity
      because there were other LATP particles in the cathode. In
      addition, the final sintered structure was still very porous, and
      thus exhibited undesirably low density and low performance.
      Sintering of LATP powder with lithium cobalt oxide (L1C0O 2)
      powder was also reported, in which a new material phase was
      detected after the sintering, most likely making the interface
      electrochemically inactive. The resulting structures displayed
      very low performance as electrodes in electrochemical cells. It
      was concluded that a sintering process could be used to construct
      all solid state batteries, but only by selecting appropriately
      matched materials, not for general cathode/solid electrolyte
      material combinations.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Sun et al. {Journal of Power Sources; 196; 6507-651 1 (201
      1 )) report making an all solid lithium ion electrode by sintering
      at 950[deg.]C lithium titanium oxide (LTO) as an active material
      component, lithium lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO) as a Li ion
      conducting electrolyte component, and silver as an electronically
      conducting component. Both the active and the electrolyte
      materials were titanium oxides, thus representing a special
      matching materials case. In addition, the reported battery cycling
      results were only for a liquid electrolyte, not a solid
      electrolyte, thus preventing any real insight into the quality of
      the cathode for an all solid state battery. The LTO electrode has
      relatively low voltage and is frequently used and/or envisioned to
      be used as an anode in a battery, although its Li intercalation
      mechanism corresponds to a cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Kotobuki et al. {Journal of the Electrochemical Society,
      157 (4); A493-A498 (2010)) fabricated a sintered electrode by
      first forming a honeycomb structure of LLTO electrolyte,
      infiltrating the honeycomb pores with suspensions of lithium
      cobalt oxide and/or lithium manganese oxide particles, then
      sintering at &gt; 700[deg.]C. The produced battery cells were able
      to be cycled, but showed unacceptably high interface impedance of
      over 20 kOhm-cm &lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Machida et al. {Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 149
      (6) A688-A693 (2002)) also studied an all solid-state battery
      containing lithium cobalt nickel oxide as an active cathode
      material and an amorphous sulfide electrolyte. These cathode and
      electrolyte materials were milled and pressed into pellets along
      with acetylene black, i.e., no sintering was performed to compact
      the cathode and electrolyte material powders. A working battery of
      these materials was assembled by compacting and maintaining them
      under constant pressure of 300MPa (3000 atm). The metallic fixture
      required to apply and maintain this high pressure severely reduces
      the volumetric and gravimetric capacities and energies of the
      battery, making it impractical.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Lee et al. {Journal of Ceramic Processing Research; Vol. 8,
      No. 2, pp. 106-109 (2007)) studied the production of lithium
      cobalt oxide (LiCo0 2) thick cathode films using screen-printing
      to produce an all solid-state micro-battery. Lee et al. mixed a
      sol gel precursor of L1C0O 2with LiCo0 2powder and then screen
      printed, achieving crack-free cathodes greater than 10
      [mu][iota][eta] in thickness. However, for characterization
      purpose, the cell was analyzed using a liquid electrolyte for a
      lithium ion battery. It was concluded that even though liquid
      electrolyte was used for cycling and there were no signs of cracks
      due to cycle stress of the half cells tested, the cathode had good
      potential to form an all solid state battery. However, the
      sintered thick cathode described by Lee et al. consisted solely of
      lithium cobalt oxide, which is an active intercalation cathode
      material. No solid electrolyte (to provide ionically conductive
      pathways) was used in the battery cell fabrication or testing.
      Thus, the cell of Lee et al. was not an all solid state battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Other experimental work has focused on developing novel
      materials and structures for solid-state lithium cathodes,
      particularly with an emphasis on improving stability and
      structure. For example, Thackeray et al. (U.S. Patent Application
      Publication No. 2004/0081888 Al and U.S. Patent No. 7,732,096)
      describe stable cathode materials with various transition metal
      oxides.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Finally, Johnson et al. (U.S. Patents Nos. 6,242,129 and
      7,540,886) disclose methods of manufacturing thin film lithium
      batteries. The thin film lithium batteries have high
      charge/discharge rates and operate over a wide temperature range,
      but their energy density and specific energy are low, due to the
      unavoidable presence of an inactive but prohibitively large
      substrate. Johnson et al. (U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
      2009/0092903) also disclose a solid state battery that consists of
      a sintered composite cathode and a sintered composite or Li metal
      anode. The sintered composite electrodes consist of an active
      intercalation material and a Li ion conducting solid electrolyte
      material. [0013] The sintered electrodes described above, which
      exhibit favorable properties, also exhibit either higher interface
      resistance than desirable between the active intercalation
      material and the solid electrolyte material or belong to a
      specially matched pair of active and electrolyte materials (LTO
      and LLTO, as an example). Most of the high specific capacity
      active materials are oxides of cobalt, manganese, nickel and their
      combinations. However, because there are no known high Li
      ionically conductive solid electrolytes that are based on Co/Mn/Ni
      oxides, no matched active material/solid electrolyte pair exists.
      It is thus difficult to achieve high performance all solid state
      lithium ion batteries using sintering, and there remains a need in
      the art for improved, low cost, high access cathodes (and low
      voltage oxide electrodes such as LTO) for all solid state
      batteries.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE&nbsp; INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] This invention is directed to a process for producing an
      impregnated, sintered composite cathode, such as for use in an all
      solid state battery, the cathode produced by the process, and a
      solid state battery containing the cathode. The process for
      producing the cathode involves four basic steps: preparing pellets
      from an active (intercalation) cathode material, sintering the
      pellets at high temperature to form a sintered porous cathode
      pellet structure, impregnating the pores with a liquid precursor
      of an inorganic amorphous ionically conductive solid electrolyte,
      and drying and curing the impregnated material to convert the
      precursor into an inorganic amorphous solid electrolyte and yield
      the composite cathode. Each of these process steps will be
      described in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The hereby disclosed invention and process apply
      particularly to oxide electrodes in lithium and lithium ion
      batteries which are mostly applied as cathodes, although there are
      examples of oxide anodes, such as lithium titanium oxide (LTO).
      Thus, for the purposes of this disclosure, the term "cathode" may
      be understood to refer not only to a cathode per se, but also to
      any active oxide electrode, even if it is used as an anode in a
      battery due to its low voltage. Additionally, although lithium
      batteries contain an anode made of pure lithium and lithium ion
      batteries contain an anode made of lithium-containing material,
      the terms "lithium battery" and "lithium ion battery" are used
      interchangeably in this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pellets from Active Cathode Powder</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] The first step in the method for producing the composite
      cathode involves preparing pellets from an active (intercalation)
      cathode material, such as an active powder. For forming a cathode,
      the active cathode powder for use in the invention is preferably
      LiMni/3 ii 3Coi 30 2 ("NCM"), which is commercially available,
      such as from Pred Materials International (New York, NY). Other
      oxide active intercalation material powders known in the art, such
      as LiCo0 2, or to be developed for use in lithium or lithium ion
      batteries would also be appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Active intercalation materials, particularly those used in
      cathodes of lithium or lithium ion batteries, are generally
      electronically conductive, including the preferred NCM and LiCo0
      2.<br>
      <br>
      However, other oxide electrode materials may also be used to form
      a composite solid state electrode according to the invention. For
      example, LTO is an oxide intercalation material that is generally
      considered to be an anode material due to its low voltage. Because
      LTO is not electronically conductive, an electronically conductive
      material, such as silver, should be added to LTO to form the
      sintered composite structure. It is also within the scope of the
      invention to add silver (or another suitable electronically
      conductive material) to the active intercalation material prior to
      sintering, even if it is electronically conductive, to enhance the
      electronic conductivity of the composite all solid state
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] To form the pellets, a slurry is first prepared by mixing
      the cathode powder with solvents, such as xylene and ethanol,
      binder(s), such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB), and/or plasticizer(s),
      such as butyl benzyl phthalate. A preferred mixture contains about
      150 g of active cathode powder, about 30 g of xylene, about 30 g
      of ethanol, about 7 g of PVB, and about 3.5 g of butyl benzyl
      phthalate. Other solvent, binder and plasticizer materials may be
      used in different material proportions provided that they form a
      slurry whose properties, such as viscosity, are suitable for tape
      casting as described in "Tape Casting: Theory and Practice" (R. E.
      Mistier and E.R. Twiname (Wiley-ACS, 2000)), which is herein
      incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The combination of powder, solvents, binder(s), and/or
      plasticizer(s) is mixed thoroughly, such as by ball milling, to
      form a homogeneous slurry, then cast into a sheet by tape casting
      on a standard flat casting table. The method of tape casting is
      well known in the art and need not be described. Appropriate
      conditions for the tape casting are known in the art or may be
      determined by routine experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The resulting sheet is then dried, such as for about two
      hours at room temperature, and rolled. In order to obtain
      uniformity and desired density, the sheet is folded and calendered
      (compacted), such as between rollers, to the desired thickness,
      preferably about 6 mil (150 microns), but generally in the
      approximate range of about 40 to 500 microns. The resulting
      uniform sheet is then punched into pellets of a desired size and
      heated to remove the organic components. For example, the sheet
      may be punched into pellets of about 3/4" diameter using a round
      puncher and heated at about 400[deg.]C in air for about two hours
      in order to remove the organic components from the pellets. These
      pellet diameters and heating conditions are merely exemplary, and
      other pellet diameters, shapes, thicknesses, techniques for
      compacting the sheet, punching the pellets, and heating protocols
      to remove the organics are also within the scope of the invention.
      Additionally, it is also within the scope of the invention to
      prepare cathode shapes other than pellets, such as sheets, wafers,
      or other shapes, provided that such shapes will function as
      desired, such as in a battery. If the composite cathode is desired
      in sheet or wafer form, it is not necessary to punch pellets from
      the sheet as previously described. Rather, the whole sheet itself
      may be sintered, as described below, to form the cathode.
      Accordingly, the description herein of pellets may be understood
      to encompass other cathode shapes as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sintering of Pellets</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0035] The pellets prepared from the active cathode powder are
      next sintered at a high temperature of about 800-1100[deg.]C,
      preferably about 900[deg.]C, in either oxygen or air, for about
      ten minutes to about twelve hours, preferably about one hour, to
      produce a self supporting porous cathode pellet structure. The
      sintering process (time and temperature profiles) is controlled so
      that the resulting structure will have sufficient porosity to
      allow for impregnation with the electrolyte solution. [0036] The
      sintered porous pellet structure has good cathode powder
      particle-to-particle contact because the particles merge during
      sintering. The cathode pellet also forms electronically conductive
      pathways because the active cathode materials are usually
      electronic conductors. If a particular oxide electrode material is
      not an electronic conductor (such as LTO), a suitable
      electronically conductive additive (silver, for example) may be
      added to the slurry to form the electronically conductive pathways
      in the sintered pellets.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Another notable feature of the sintered cathode pellet is
      that it is very uniform due to the tape casting method and the
      calendering process. This uniformity provides a good structure to
      fill with electrolyte in the subsequent step and yield an
      excellent composite high access cathode. SEM images of the surface
      and cross section structure of an exemplary sintered cathode
      material are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, which clearly
      show the uniformity of the porous structure. The typical density
      of the sintered cathode pellet without solid electrolyte is
      estimated from SEM images of its surface and cross section to be
      about 60%. However, the porosity may be greater or less than this
      amount and this density (porosity) is exemplary, not limiting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Impregnation of Porous Pellet Structure</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] For an all solid state lithium or lithium ion battery to
      have high access, capacity, and energy density, it must have
      effective pathways for the lithium ions and electrons to move
      throughout the body of the cathode during charge and discharge of
      the battery. As previously explained, the sintered porous pellets
      have effective electron pathways. In order to provide effective
      ionic pathways in the body of the cathode pellet of an all solid
      state battery, it is necessary to fill the pores of the pellet
      with a solid inorganic electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Thus, the next step in the method involves filling the
      pores in the sintered pellet with a liquid precursor solution of
      an inorganic amorphous ionically conductive solid electrolyte to
      form ionic pathways. Preferred solid electrolytes for use in the
      invention are amorphous lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO),
      lithium carbon lanthanum zirconium oxide (LCLZO), and lithium
      lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO). LLZO and LCLZO are described in
      United States Patent Application Publications Nos. 2011/0053001
      and 2012/0196189, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated
      by reference in their entirety. These application publications
      will hereinafter be referred to as "the '001 publication" and "the
      [Iota]89 publication," respectively. For the purposes of this
      disclosure, the term "LLZO" may be understood to refer to LLZO
      and/or LCLZO. It is also within the scope of the invention to
      utilize alternative amorphous inorganic ionically conductive
      materials instead of or in addition to the LLZO. Other preferred
      materials are also amorphous, oxide-based compounds. For example,
      appropriate amorphous inorganic materials are those in which one
      or more of the elements in LLZO has been partially or completely
      replaced by a different element, such as replacing zirconium with
      tantalum. Such alternative materials are also described in the
      '001 and [Iota] 89 application publications and all of the
      materials described therein are also within the scope of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The process of inserting an inorganic solid electrolyte
      into the pores of the sintered pellets begins by impregnating the
      cathode pores with an inorganic solid electrolyte precursor
      solution and then curing the solution to form the solid inorganic
      electrolyte. This process has its challenges. A main challenge is
      due to surface tension of the electrolyte precursor solution. The
      surface tension controls the wetting of the cathode surface by the
      precursor solution ,which is necessary to fully impregnate the
      cathode pores. It has been found that the surface tension of the
      preferred LLZO precursor solution is adequate for wetting the
      porous sintered cathode pores.<br>
      <br>
      Another challenge is due to high shrinkage of the electrolyte
      precursor when forming the solid inorganic electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] According to an embodiment of the invention, the pores of
      the sintered porous cathode are first evacuated to remove all of
      the air, such as, for example, with a small vacuum pump. The pores
      are then impregnated with a precursor solution for the inorganic
      solid amorphous electrolyte. For example, appropriate precursor
      solutions for LLZO and LCLZO are described in detail in U.S.
      Patent Application Publications Nos. 201 1/0053001 and
      2012/0196189. In a preferred embodiment, the solution contains a
      lanthanum alkoxide, a lithium alkoxide, and a zirconium alkoxide
      dissolved in a solvent, such as an alcohol. Preferred precursors
      include lithium butoxide, lanthanum methoxyethoxide, and zirconium
      butoxide, and a preferred solvent is methoxyethanol. These
      precursor components are exemplary, not limiting, and alternative
      precursor solutions are also within the scope of the invention,
      provided that they contain the required lithium, lanthanum,
      zirconium, and oxygen components in appropriate concentrations. It
      is also within the scope of the invention to prepare more than one
      solution, such as three solutions each containing one of the
      desired lithium, lanthanum, or zirconium components. If an
      amorphous material other than or in addition to LLZO/LCLZO is to
      be contained in the final cathode, the appropriate precursor
      solution(s) should contain the desired components in appropriate
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Appropriate precursor solutions for LLTO, another preferred
      electrolyte, are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 8,21 1
      ,496, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference
      in its entirety. These precursor solutions are exemplary, not
      limiting, and even the preferred LLZO and LCLZO may be applied
      from alternative precursor solutions, provided that they contain
      the required lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen components
      in appropriate concentrations.<br>
      Impregnation is preferably performed by casting the solution over
      the surface of the pellet, so that the solution impregnates the
      evacuated pores by capillary action.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] It has been found that the preferred LLZO precursor
      solution, which is prepared from commercially available metal
      precursors, some of which (such as lanthanum methoxyethoxide and
      zirconium butoxide) are obtained in solution, exhibits high volume
      shrinkage of about 90% when cured to form an amorphous solid LLZO
      electrolyte. This high shrinkage is inconvenient because it
      requires many impregnation cycles of the pores with the precursor
      solution in order to reach an adequate level of pore filling,
      defined by formation of fast lithium ion conductive pathways
      through the amorphous solid electrolyte that is present in the
      pores. It has been found that a number of the impregnation steps
      may be eliminated by utilizing a condensed (concentrated)
      precursor solution (containing less solvent than the original
      precursor solution but the same amounts of the other components)
      that shrinks less during the curing process than the dilute
      solution. If the precursor solution for the solid electrolyte is
      prepared in more concentrated form, it is not necessary to perform
      such a condensation step.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Condensation of the precursor solution may be accomplished
      by heating a dilute precursor solution, such as the LLZO precursor
      solution previously described, in an inert environment, such as
      nitrogen or argon. A preferred heating temperature is about
      80[deg.]C, although it may vary in a wide range from about room
      temperature to about 100[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] High ionic conductivity of the amorphous electrolyte is
      necessary for its successful application in a lithium ion battery.
      The ionic conductivity of amorphous LLZO/LCLZO samples prepared
      from condensed precursor solutions having different condensation
      levels was measured in order to determine the optimal condensation
      level.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] It was found that condensing the LLZO precursor solution in
      ozone maintains the high ionic conductivity, allowing for the use
      of a more concentrated solution to fill the pores of the cathode
      and reducing the number of impregnations necessary to achieve the
      desired ionic conductivity levels. Consequently, if the precursor
      solution is determined to be too dilute (resulting from the fact
      that the desired precursors are commercially obtained in
      solution), the precursor solution is preferably condensed prior to
      impregnation into the pores of the sintered cathode. If the LLZO
      precursor solution described previously is utilized, it is
      preferably condensed by about 25% to about 50%. However, it is
      preferred to prepare a more concentrated precursor solution so
      that the condensation process is not required, yet high
      conductivity and low shrinkage can still be achieved. [0047] The
      SEM image of a cathode partially filled with solid LLZO
      electrolyte is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the amorphous
      solid electrolyte partially fills the pores or coats the NCM
      sintered particles, based on the amorphous material seen in the
      image, forming continuous pathways for lithium ions. It is not
      necessary to completely fill the pores with solid electrolyte; the
      pores only need to be partially filled to establish the desired
      high conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Curing the Electrolyte</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] The final step in the process of producing an impregnated
      sintered composite solid state cathode involves curing the liquid
      precursor solution of the inorganic amorphous solid electrolyte by
      drying and heating the impregnated pellets. For example, drying
      and heating may be effected by maintaining the samples in an
      ozone-rich and low humidity air environment for about one hour
      followed by heating at approximately 70 to 130[deg.]C, more
      preferably about 75 to 90[deg.]C, most preferably about 80[deg.]C
      for about 30 minutes, preferably in an ozone-rich air and low
      humidity environment, followed by heating at approximately 280 to
      350[deg.]C, more preferably about 300-310[deg.]C for about 30
      minutes in low-humidity air. The specific drying and heating times
      and temperatures may be varied, but are preferably performed at no
      higher than about 350[deg.]C. Importantly, the lower temperature
      curing is performed in an ozone-rich (preferably containing at
      least about 0.05 ppm ozone) and low humidity (preferably less than
      about 30 percent relative humidity) environment, and the higher
      temperature heating is performed in low humidity air. The
      resulting composite solid state cathode containing impregnated
      amorphous solid electrolyte may be used to form a solid state
      battery, but is not limited to this application.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As previously explained, the method for producing an
      impregnated sintered composite solid state cathode may also be
      used to produce any other electrode in which the active material
      operates by intercalation and can be sintered. For example,
      lithium titanium oxide (LTO) is an intercalation oxide that can be
      sintered, and the above described impregnation and curing steps
      may be used to form a functional electrode from a sintered LTO
      pellet. The LTO electrode is used as an anode in a battery due to
      its low voltage, although in every other way it is and behaves as
      a cathode.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Composite Solid State Cathode</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] The invention is also directed to an impregnated sintered
      solid-state composite cathode, such as for an all solid state
      battery. The composite cathode contains a sintered active
      intercalation material having pores impregnated with an inorganic
      ionically conductive amorphous solid electrolyte. The active
      intercalation material is sintered in the form of a compact porous
      structure and is preferably in the form of sintered pellets
      prepared from an active cathode powder, as previously described.
      However, the invention is not limited to composite cathodes in the
      shape of pellets. Rather, it is also within the scope of the
      invention for the composite cathode to be the shape of a sheet,
      wafer, or any other shape, provided that it contains the desired
      components and will function as desired, such as in a battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Active intercalation materials, particularly those used in
      cathodes of lithium or lithium ion batteries, are generally
      electronically conductive. However, other oxide electrode
      materials may also be used to form a composite solid state
      electrode according to the invention. For example, LTO is an oxide
      intercalation material that is generally considered to be an anode
      material due to its low voltage. Because LTO is not electronically
      conductive, an electronically conductive material, such as silver,
      must be added to LTO to form the sintered structure. It is also
      within the scope of the invention to add silver (or another
      suitable electronically conductive material) to the active
      intercalation material even if it is electronically conductive to
      enhance the electronic conductivity of the composite all solid
      state structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The inorganic amorphous solid electrolyte in the solid
      state cathode is most preferably amorphous solid LLZO and/or
      LCLZO, as previously described. Preferably, the inorganic
      amorphous solid electrolyte is impregnated into the pores of the
      sintered cathode as a liquid precursor solution and then subjected
      to a thermal drying and curing process to convert the precursor
      solution into the amorphous solid electrolyte. Although LLZO and
      LCLZO are most preferred, it is also within the scope of the
      invention to utilize other inorganic ionically conductive
      materials, provided that they can be impregnated into the pores of
      the cathode as a liquid and then solidified after a relatively low
      temperature curing process. For example, a mixed electronic/ionic
      conductor, such as amorphous LLTO, may also be used to impregnate
      the electrode pores in another preferred embodiment. Other
      preferred amoiphous inorganic materials are oxide-based materials.
      Further, other appropriate amorphous inorganic materials are those
      in which one or more of the elements in LLZO has been partially or
      completely replaced by a different element, such as replacing
      zirconium with tantalum. Such alternative materials are also
      described in the '001 and ' 189 application publications and all
      of the materials described therein are also within the scope of
      the invention. [0053] As previously explained, the invention is
      also directed to other solid state composite electrodes, such as
      anodes, which have the same structure as described above with
      respect to the cathode. In particular, an LTO electrode having an
      impregnated sintered structure is also included in the invention.
      [0054] The cathodes and low voltage oxide electrodes according to
      the invention thus fulfill a need in the art for improved, low
      cost, high access electrodes, which may be used in the production
      of all solid state batteries. Solid State Battery<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Finally, the invention is directed to a solid state lithium
      or lithium ion battery comprising an impregnated sintered
      composite solid state cathode, an anode, and a separator, in which
      the composite solid state cathode is as described previously. The
      separator may be any solid electrolyte known in the art or to be
      developed, such as UPON, crystalline LLZO, amorphous LLZO, etc.
      The anode may be any anode material known in the art or to be
      developed, such as lithium metal, alloys thereof, and LTO. Methods
      for depositing the solid electrolyte separator and anode materials
      on top of a solid cathode are well known in the art and need not
      be described. Methods for producing solid state batteries from
      cathode, anode, and separator components are also well known in
      the art and also need not be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Additionally, the invention is directed to a solid state
      lithium or lithium ion battery comprising an impregnated sintered
      composite solid state anode, a cathode, and a separator, in which
      the composite solid state anode is as described previously. In
      other words, a solid state lithium or lithium ion battery
      according to an embodiment of the invention comprises an
      impregnated sintered composite state electrode as described
      previously, a lithium-containing counter electrode, and a
      separator.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The invention addresses problems with prior art electrodes
      by providing a freestanding high-access cathode structure with
      thickness of 1 [Omicron][Omicron][mu][eta][iota] or greater, if
      desired. The invention also overcomes disadvantages of prior art
      electrodes with regard to low energy density and access of the
      cathode, thus improving capacity and rate capability of the
      resulting battery. Specifically, enhancing access of the cathode
      by providing ionic and electronic pathways for lithium ions and
      electrons to travel during the charge and discharge processes is
      achieved by filling the pores of a highly electronically
      conductive cathode with a highly ionically conductive material,
      such as amorphous LLZO. This is effectively achieved by
      concentrating an electrolyte precursor solution, such that
      shrinkage after curing is much less than a regular unconcentrated
      precursor solution of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Another problem addressed by the present invention is that
      of solid-state reactions when sintering the cathode material and
      the solid electrolyte. This problem is resolved by first sintering
      the cathode to obtain excellent electronic conductivity, and then
      filling the pores of the sintered cathode with a liquid precursor
      solution of the amorphous solid electrolyte, which cures in the
      pores to form the solid amorphous electrolyte and the composite
      solid state structure. By this method, a safe solid state cathode
      having higher access, capacity and energy density compared to
      currently available cathodes is obtained. The invention also
      provides low voltage cathodes, such as LTO, which may be used as
      anodes in solid state batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The current invention is thus an improvement on both liquid
      electrolyte and thin film batteries whereby a novel freestanding
      cathode, between about 50 and 400[mu][eta][iota] thick, is
      fabricated with enhanced safety, access, capacity and energy
      density by a low-cost process.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] This invention will now be described in connection with the
      following, non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1 : Preparation of Cathode Pellet</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0061] A slurry was prepared from 150 g of cathode powder (NCM),
      obtained from Pred Materials International (New York, NY), about
      30 g of xylene, about 30 g of ethanol, about 7 g of PVB, and about
      3.5 g of butyl benzyl phthalate. The combination of powder,
      solvents, binder(s), and plasticizer(s) was mixed thoroughly by
      ball milling to form a homogeneous slurry, then cast into a sheet
      by tape casting on a standard flat casting table.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The resulting sheet was dried for about two hours at room
      temperature, folded, and calendered (compacted) between rollers
      using a roller-compactor apparatus to the desired thickness of
      about 6 mil (150 microns). The resulting uniform sheet was then
      punched into pellets of about 3/4" diameter using a round puncher
      and heated at about 400[deg.]C in air for about two hours in order
      to remove the organic components from the pellets. The pellets
      were then sintered at 900[deg.]C in oxygen for about one hour to
      produce a self supporting porous cathode pellet structure. SEM
      images of the sintered porous pellets are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A LLZO sol gel precursor solution was prepared by
      dissolving about 9 grams of a lanthanum methoxyethoxide solution
      (about 12% by weight in methoxyethanol), about 1.3 grams of
      lithium butoxide and about 1.54 gram of a zirconium butoxide
      solution (about 80% by weight in butanol) in about 10 grams of
      methoxyethanol. The precursor components were obtained from either
      Gelest or Alfa Aesar. The thoroughly-mixed precursor solution was
      left in a bottle in an inert environment for about 1 to 1.5 hours
      to help facilitate substantially complete dissolution of the
      lithium butoxide. The solution was then condensed to 75%o
      condensed precursor solution by heating at 80[deg.]C for about 3
      hours. [0064] The pores of the sintered porous cathode were
      evacuated with a small vacuum pump to remove the air, then
      impregnated with the LLZO precursor solution by casting the
      solution over the surface of the pellets, so that the solution
      impregnated the evacuated pores by capillary action.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Finally, the precursor solution was dried and cured by
      maintaining the impregnated pellets in an ozone-rich (at least
      0.05 ppm) and low humidity (less than about 30%) air environment
      for about 1 hour, heating at approximately 80[deg.]C for about 30
      minutes in an ozone-rich air and low humidity environment,
      followed by heating at approximately 300[deg.]C for about 30
      minutes in air. The SEM image of a cross section of an LLZO
      impregnated sintered pellet is shown in Fig. 3. EXAMPLE 2:
      Comparison of Precursor Solution Concentration<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Measurements were performed by spin coating differently
      condensed precursor solutions onto glass substrates with
      conductive aluminum strips. After curing of the spin-coated layers
      by the regular LLZO curing process, a second layer of gold
      contacts was sputtered on top.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The impedance of the resulting amorphous LLZO films was
      measured using an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
      instrument. The EIS data for the amorphous LLZO films prepared
      from 25%, 50% and 75% condensed precursor solutions (75%
      represents the highest concentration) are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and
      6, respectively. The resistance used to calculate the conductivity
      of the LLZO films is taken at the high frequency real axis
      intercept of the Nyquist plot, which is more clearly shown in the
      inset of the graphs. Using this resistance and the thickness and
      the geometry of the sample, the conductivity may be estimated.
      Fig. 7 is a graph of the conductivity of the amorphous films for
      the three concentration levels of the precursor solutions as a
      function of concentration. It can be seen that the ionic
      conductivity decreases as the concentration level increases,
      although it did not change drastically from the 25% to the 50%
      condensed solution (6E-4 S/cm vs. 5E-4 S/cm). The conductivities
      of the 25% and 50% condensed solutions are both adequate for use
      in all solid state lithium batteries.<br>

      2011/0053001 , the amorphous solid LLZO drying and gelling
      environment is controlled by relative humidity, ambient
      temperature, and ozone level. Accordingly, the influence of ozone
      on the LLZO precursor solution condensation process was tested to
      ensure mutual compatibility. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plot for an

      [0069] It was found that the ionic conductivity of this amorphous

      A method for forming an amorphous ionically conductive metal
      oxide, such as lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO), by
      chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as well as to the ionically
      conductive material formed by the method, are provided. Such a
      material may be utilized as a solid electrolyte and/or as a solid
      separator in an all solid state lithium battery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] This invention relates to a method for forming an amorphous
      ionically conductive metal oxide, such as lithium lanthanum
      zirconium oxide (LLZO), by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as
      well as to the ionically conductive material formed by the method.
      Such a material may be utilized as a solid electrolyte and/or a
      solid separator in an all solid state, or ceramic, battery cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] A battery cell is a particularly useful article that
      provides stored electrical energy that can be used to energize a
      multitude of devices, particularly portable devices that require
      an electrical power source. A battery cell, which is often
      referred to in an abbreviated form as a "battery," is an
      electrochemical apparatus typically formed of at least one
      electrolyte (also referred to as an "electrolytic conductor")
      disposed between a pair of spaced apart electrodes. Upon
      completion of a circuit between the electrodes, the battery
      discharges electrical current as ions flow from a negative
      electrode (anode) to a positive electrode (cathode).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Rechargeable batteries, also known as secondary batteries,
      are useful because the energy available for discharge can be
      replenished by reversing the flow of current between the
      electrodes such that ions flow from the positive cathode to the
      negative anode. The type of electrolyte used in rechargeable
      batteries is important. It is desirable to utilize an electrolyte
      that promotes optimum transport of ions but that is compatible
      with the electrode materials and does not adversely affect
      performance over time or contribute to safety issues. For example,
      lithium is a desirable anode material because it possesses high
      energy density. However, the use of lithium as an anode material
      has presented problems because many materials that are otherwise
      very effective as electrolytes react adversely with lithium. As
      another example, many ionically-conductive liquids are effective
      for ion transport but contribute to diminished performance over
      time and safety issues.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the context of the present invention, all solid state
      batteries are batteries that contain solid electrodes and solid
      inorganic electrolytes. All solid state lithium and lithium-ion
      batteries typically contain at least three major components: (1) a
      cathode, normally made of transition metal oxide powder (such as
      lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, or lithium
      manganese nickel cobalt oxide). The cathode material may be
      sintered to achieve the required electronic conductivity and
      structural integrity or it may be mixed with carbon or graphite
      powder to provide electronic conductivity and act as a binder for
      structural integrity, (2) an anode, made of Li, a Li alloy, or
      another material capable of intercalating lithium, such as carbon,
      silicon, lithium titanium oxide, etc., and (3) a solid electrolyte
      that also serves as a separator between the cathode and anode.<br>
      <br>
      Although lithium batteries contain an anode made of pure lithium
      and lithium ion batteries contain an anode made of
      lithium-containing material, the terms "lithium battery" and
      "lithium ion battery" are used interchangeably in this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The solid electrolyte is a key element in an all solid
      state lithium or lithium ion battery. For optimal battery
      performance, the solid electrolyte should have high Li ion
      conductivity but negligible electronic conductivity, have long
      term chemical stability against chemical reactions with metallic
      lithium, and have high voltage stability (higher than 5.5V). (See,
      for example, Kotobuki et al; J.Electrochem. Soc. 157, A1076- 1079
      (2010)). Using a solid electrolyte in a lithium battery eliminates
      the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer
      between Li metal and liquid electrolyte. In liquid electrolyte
      systems, a SEI film forms during the first electrochemical charge
      due to the electrochemical reduction of species present in the
      electrolyte. (See Xu Kang, Chem. Rev, 104, 4303-4417 (2004)). Its
      formation causes irreversible battery capacity loss associated
      with the active lithium consumption during the initial SEI layer
      formation. Additional SEI layer growth in subsequent
      charge-discharge cycles further lowers the battery capacity by
      irreversible depletion of the active lithium, also limiting the
      cycle life of the battery. Accordingly, utilizing a solid
      electrolyte in an all solid state battery will allow a battery to
      reach high energy density and utilize metallic lithium anode
      without detriment to the battery operation. In addition, using an
      inorganic oxide as an electrolyte prevents loss of oxygen from the
      cathode materials at high charge voltages, thereby increasing the
      stability of the cathode and improving the cycle life of the
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Different types of materials have been reported as Li-ion
      conducting materials, including Li3N, Li-P-alumina, LiSi04,
      L13PO4, LiSICON (lithium superionic conductors, e.g., Lii4Z
      Ge40i6), lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON), lanthanum lithium
      titanate (LLTO), lithium titanium phosphate (LTP), lithium
      aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP), and garnet-like crystalline
      structure compounds having the formula LisLa3M20i2 (M=Nb, Ta) or
      Li7La3Zr20i2. (See Ramzy et al.; Applied Materials &amp;
      Interfaces 2, 385-390 (2010)). A limitation of the reported
      compounds is that they have either high ionic conductivity or high
      electrochemical stability, but not both. <br>
      <br>
      [0009] Crystalline Li7La3Zr20i2 (cLLZ) has been recently reported
      as a new type of garnet-like structure with high lithium-ion
      conductivity and stability with lithium metal. (See Murugan et
      al.; Ang w. Chem. Int. Ed. 46, 7778-7781 (2007) and Kokal et al.;
      Solid State Ionics, 185, 42-46 (201 1)). This powder material has
      been synthesized by a solid-state reaction or sol-gel high
      temperature synthesis and sintered into a pellet for
      characterization, reportedly having high ionic conductivity in the
      10&lt;"4&gt; to 10&lt;"3&gt; S/cm range. cLLZ has also been
      reported to be stable with molten lithium and when exposed to air
      and moisture. Thus, it appears that cLLZ satisfied all the major
      criteria for a lithium ion solid electrolyte. However, in an
      attempt to cycle a LiCo02/cLLZ/Li cell, the discharge capacity was
      very low, much lower than expected based on the quantity of LiCo02
      cathode involved, which was mostly attributed to the high
      interfacial resistance between the cLLZ pellet and electrodes. A
      study of the interface between LiCo02 and cLLZ revealed the
      formation of a thick intermediate layer of La2Co04 at the
      &lt;?LLZ/LiCo02 interface that was believed to be created by a
      mutual diffusion of elements during deposition and processing at
      700[deg.]C (Kim et al.; J. of Power Sources, 196, 764-767 (201
      1)). This diffusion layer undergoes further changes during
      electrochemical charge-discharge cycles and severely limits the
      performance of the solid state battery. Thus, lowering the
      deposition temperature can substantially decrease or eliminate the
      diffusion process and lower the interface resistance.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 201 1/0053001 of
      Babic et al. describes a novel lithium ionic conductor material,
      amorphous lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (aLLZO), which
      exhibits high ionic conductivity (~10&lt;"3&gt; S/cm), high
      transport number (~1), is stable with metallic lithium, and has a
      high voltage stability window (up to 10V). The aLLZO film taught
      in the '001 publication is prepared from a sol-gel process,
      yielding crack-free and precipitate-free sol gel aLLZO films with
      a smooth surface. However, some pinholes can occur during film
      nucleation and could propagate without filling in as the layer
      thickness increases. Since even a single remaining pinhole may
      result in the failure of a cell, a second continuous layer of
      solid electrolyte may be applied. For example, a thin layer of
      lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) (2 [mu][eta][iota]) may be
      used to fill the pores in electrolyte films. However, such films
      require expensive vacuum equipment for sputtering and are unstable
      in air (Nimisha et al., Solid State Ionics 185, 47-51 (201 1)),
      making sample handling and transferring during manufacturing very
      complicated and expensive.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Thus, alternative solid electrolyte materials for high
      performance all solid state batteries are desirable. Such
      materials would desirably provide a high level of ion transport,
      be defect free, and be effective for charge and discharge but not
      interact adversely with lithium, adversely affect performance over
      time, or contribute to safety issues.<br>

      A rechargeable lithium air battery comprises a non-aqueous
      electrolyte disposed between a spaced-apart pair of a lithium
      anode and an air cathode. The electrolyte includes including a
      lithium salt and an additive containing an alkylene group or a
      lithium salt and an organosilicon compound. The alkylene additive
      may be alkylene carbonate, alkylene siloxane, or a combination of

      may be vinylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, or a combination of
      vinylene carbonate and butylene carbonate. The alkylene siloxane
      may be a polymerizable silane such as triacetoxyvinylsilane. In
      preferred embodiments, the organosilicon compound is a silane
      containing polyethyleneoxide side chain(s).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] A battery cell is a particularly useful article that
      provides stored electrical energy which can be used to energize a
      multitude of devices requiring an electrical power source. A
      battery cell, which is often referred to, somewhat inaccurately,
      in an abbreviated form as a "battery," is an electrochemical
      apparatus typically formed of at least one electrolyte (also
      referred to as an "electrolytic conductor") disposed between a
      pair of spaced apart electrodes. The electrodes and electrolyte
      are the reactants for a chemical reaction that causes an electric
      current to flow between the electrodes when the electrode ends
      that are not in contact with the electrolyte are connected to one
      another through an object or device (generally referred to as the
      "load") to be powered. The flow of electrons through the free ends
      of the electrodes is accompanied and caused by the creation and
      flow of ions in and through the electrolyte under a reaction
      potential between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In a non-rechargeable battery cell, the chemical reaction
      that produces the flow of electric current also causes one or more
      of the reactants to be consumed or degraded over time as the cell
      discharges, thereby depleting the cell. In contrast, in a
      rechargeable battery cell, after the cell has partially or fully
      discharged its electrical potential, the chemical reaction may be
      reversed by applying an electric current to the cell that causes
      electrons to flow in an opposite direction between the electrodes
      and an associated flow of ions. Thus, it can be appreciated that
      rechargeable battery cells are extremely useful as a source of
      electrical power that can be replenished.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] A problem in utilizing rechargeable batteries is that it is
      often difficult to return the reactants to their original, pre-use
      state, that is, the pristine or ideal (or as close as possible)
      condition that the reactants are in before the cell is used. This
      problem relates to specific problems associated with returning
      each individual reactant to its original state.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Lithium air batteries are attractive batteries because they
      provide high energy density from easily-obtainable and inexpensive
      electrode reactant materials, namely, lithium and air. In a
      lithium air battery, lithium serves as the anode and the cathode
      is formed of a light-weight, inexpensive substrate that is capable
      of supporting a catalyst for facilitating oxygen's role as a
      reactant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A problem with rechargeable lithium air batteries is that
      they are particularly difficult to recharge multiple times due to
      the characteristics of lithium. Specifically, it is often
      difficult to return the lithium anode to its pre-discharge
      condition because of imperfections formed on the surface of the
      anode during the discharge-recharge cycling. Imperfection problems
      include a roughening of the surface of the anode and the formation
      of pores in the anode. Another serious imperfection problem is
      that the surface of the lithium anode that is in contact with the
      electrolyte may be degraded by the formation of dendrites.
      Dendrites are thin protuberances that can grow upon and outwardly
      of a surface of an electrode during recharging of the cell.
      Recharging causes a re-plating of the lithium anode. Not only do
      dendrites inhibit proper plating or re-plating of the electrode,
      but also, one or more branches of dendrites may grow long enough
      so as to extend through the electrolyte between the anode and
      cathode and thereby provide a direct connection that can
      electrically short circuit the cell. An electrical short is
      undesirable in and of itself but, in addition, the current passing
      through an electrical short may cause the temperature through the
      electrolyte to increase to a point wherein the electrolyte is no
      longer effective and/or the electrolyte and/or the cell itself may
      ignite. Thus, known lithium air batteries have a very limited
      useful life. It can thus be appreciated that it would be useful to
      develop a rechargeable lithium air battery cell that can be
      discharged and recharged effectively many times.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A concern in recharging a rechargeable battery is how much
      electrical energy will be required to restore the battery to its
      pre-discharged state and potential. This level of electrical is
      typically greater than the electrical energy initially provided by
      the battery. However, it is desirable that the electrical energy
      required to recharge a rechargeable battery be minimized so as to
      reduce the cost of operation and to prevent damage to the battery.
      Thus, it can be appreciated that it would be useful to develop a
      rechargeable lithium air battery in which the voltage level and
      amount of energy required to recharge the battery are minimized.
      The excess energy required during recharge is associated with a
      difficulty in reversing the reactions that take place in an air
      cathode. Reactions in the cathode are plagued with parasitic
      reactions involving the electrolyte. These reactions can consume
      the electrolyte and cause degradations in performance. Therefore,
      a more stable electrolyte is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Most battery systems developed to date are based on
      aqueous-based alkaline electrolytes. A popular example is the
      zinc/oxygen battery that is in commercial use for hearing aids.
      Electric Fuel Corp. produces primary zinc air batteries for
      cellular phone applications. Electrically rechargeable zinc air
      batteries use bifunctional oxygen electrodes so that both the
      charge and discharge processes take place within the battery
      structure. AER Energy Resources, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.) designed an
      electrically rechargeable zinc air cell; however, the cyclability
      of this battery is too low to satisfy the requirements of many
      commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the
      development of lithium oxygen batteries. To overcome water
      corrosion problems, non-aqueous electrolytes typically used in
      lithium and lithium ion batteries have been utilized. For example,
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,209 describes a lithium oxygen battery based
      on an organic electrolyte using carbon powder as an air electrode
      and cobalt phthalocyanine as a catalyst. The battery was shown to
      have an open-circuit potential of approximately 3V and an
      operating voltage between 2.0 to 2.8V.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Although the '209 patent suggests that the lithium/oxygen
      batteries were rechargeable, no more than two complete cycles were
      reported. On the other hand, the formation of Li2O2 in the
      discharged air electrode was observed by chemical titration
      analysis, but the disappearance of Li2O2 in the recharged (not
      original) air electrode was not shown. Therefore, the
      rechargeability of this lithium oxygen battery is not conclusive.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The discharge mechanism of a lithium oxygen battery is
      primarily the deposition of Li2O2 in the carbon-based air
      electrode. Since the reduction of O2 to O&lt;2-&gt; occurs only in
      the presence of a catalyst, the product is often the peroxide,
      O2&lt;2-&gt;. The reactions of lithium with oxygen are:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      2Li+O2-&gt;Li2O2 E[deg.]=3.10 V<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      4Li+O2-&gt;2Li2O E[deg.]=2.91V<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Before completely forming peroxide, an oxygen molecule can
      reduce to form a superoxide radical which links with one lithium
      cation, forming lithium superoxide. This intermediate can
      precipitate within the cathode, forming peroxide, which may
      support ongoing cycling or attack carbonate based solvents through
      nucleophilic mechanisms, thus choking off cycling. Lithium
      superoxide is not a stable compound and will convert to peroxide,
      but this in part depends upon the stability of the solvent. The
      superoxide reaction is expected to proceed as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      O2+Li&lt;+&gt;+e&lt;-&gt;-&gt;LiO2<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      2LiO2-&gt;Li2O2+O2<br>
      <br>
      [0013] There remains a need in the art for further improvements in
      battery structure to maximize the potential of rechargeable
      lithium air and lithium oxygen batteries.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0034] Embodiments of the present invention are described herein.
      The disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention
      that may be embodied in various and alternative forms, and
      combinations thereof. As used herein, the word "exemplary" is used
      expansively to refer to embodiments that serve as illustrations,
      specimens, models, or patterns. The figures are not necessarily to
      scale and some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show
      details of particular components. In other instances, well-known
      components, systems, materials, or methods have not been described
      in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.
      Therefore, at least some specific structural and functional
      details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting,
      but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis
      for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overview</b><br>
      <br>
      [0035] As an overview, the invention teaches a first electrolyte
      for a rechargeable battery that has a lithium anode and an air
      cathode, which improved electrolyte helps to increase the useful
      life and effectiveness of the battery. This electrolyte according
      to the invention also optimizes (lowers) the level of charge
      voltage required by the battery during recharging, thereby further
      increasing the usefulness of the battery. The electrolyte is also
      stable in the presence of the superoxide radical.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Non-aqueous electrolytes are often used with lithium cells
      to avoid undesirable reactions between lithium and water-based
      electrolytes. However, in a cell, a film will typically form on a
      lithium electrode immersed in a non-aqueous electrolyte. These
      films form when the lithium metal immersed in the non-aqueous
      liquid electrolyte generally reacts with the electrolyte solvent,
      the electrolyte salt, and trace impurities or dissolved gases to
      form the film. Rather than leaving the nature of the surface film
      that forms to chance, in one embodiment, the invention modifies
      the film by introducing additives to the electrolyte solution.
      These additives are tailored to react with the electrode surfaces
      and form a surface stabilizing film that is conducive to lithium
      cycling. This electrolyte of the invention changes the chemical
      composition of the film such that it adopts characteristics that
      inhibit the growth of dendrites on the lithium electrode. The
      invention thus converts the natural presence of the film to a
      beneficial use in fighting dendrite growth. To convert the film to
      a desirable composition, the invention uses as additives a class
      of organic compounds that are capable of being dissolved in the
      electrolyte solution and capable of polymerizing when placed in
      contact with lithium metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] A second electrolyte according to the invention contains an
      organosilicon compound. These compounds have been found to improve
      the reversibility of batteries. Silicon-based electrolytes are
      advantageous due to high conductivity, safety, and favorable
      electrochemical and chemical properties. The premise behind
      organosilicon based electrolytes is that they are not susceptible
      to nucleophilic attack, but maintain properties needed for lithium
      air cycling. Thus, silicon-containing electrolytes represent a
      growing area of interest as a means for improving the safety of
      lithium air batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As a further aspect of this overview and introduction, it
      is to be noted that the air cathode that is utilized in the
      invention comprises a porous substrate which supports a material
      that serves as a catalyst to facilitate oxygen's role in the
      electrochemical reaction that produces energy. In a lithium air
      battery, oxygen is the cathode reactant for the overall
      electrochemical reaction that creates electricity. Oxygen is
      placed in condition for reacting at the substrate that forms the
      cathode support member. The cathode may employ a catalyst that
      facilitates oxygen's participation in the electrochemical
      reaction. The oxygen may be in an isolated (or pure state), or the
      cathode may use oxygen that is present in ambient air. The oxygen
      in ambient air is a natural component of air. Hence, the use of
      the term "air battery" or "lithium air battery." For the purposes
      of this disclosure, the term "lithium air battery" may also be
      understood to encompass "lithium oxygen batteries." In both
      systems, lithium reacts with oxygen, forming Li2O or Li2O2. The
      distinction between lithium air and lithium-oxygen batteries is
      the type of oxygen source that is used: oxygen from a tank or
      oxygen from air. The electrolytes according to the invention are
      appropriate for both types of systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Invention Described in Detail</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] Although the term "battery" technically may more properly
      define a combination of two or more cells, it has come to be used
      popularly to refer to a single cell. Thus the term battery by
      itself is sometimes used herein for convenience of explanation to
      refer to what is actually a single cell. The teachings herein that
      are applicable to a single cell are applicable equally to each
      cell of a battery containing multiple cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals
      indicate like elements throughout the several views, the drawings
      illustrate certain of the various aspects of exemplary
      embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Referring first to FIG. 1, therein is illustrated a
      schematic representation of a rechargeable battery cell 10
      according to an embodiment of the invention. A non-aqueous
      electrolyte 16 is disposed between a spaced-apart pair of a
      lithium anode 12 and an air cathode 14. The electrolyte 16
      includes a lithium salt and further includes an additive
      comprising an alkylene compound or includes an organosilicon
      compound according to the invention, as described in more detail
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Referring now to FIG. 2, therein is illustrated a schematic
      representation of a rechargeable battery cell 20 according to a
      second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a
      separator 25 is disposed between and separates a lithium anode 22
      and an air cathode 24. The separator 25 is infused with a
      non-aqueous electrolyte 26. The electrolyte 26 includes a lithium
      salt and further includes an additive comprising an alkylene
      compound or includes an organosilicon compound according to the
      invention, as described in more detail below. The lithium anode 22
      adjoins an anode current-collector 30. The anode current-collector
      30 may be formed of copper metal or a copper alloy.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] An anode current-collector rod 32 is disposed in contact
      with the anode current-collector 30 and provides an anode
      connecting point for the cell 20. The anode current-connector rod
      32 may be formed of a copper-based material such as copper metal
      or a copper alloy. A cathode current-connector rod 34 is disposed
      in contact with the air cathode 24 and provides a cathode
      connecting point for the cell 20. The cathode current-connector
      rod 34 may be formed of an aluminum material, such as aluminum
      metal or an aluminum alloy (aluminum fused with zinc or copper,
      for example), or may be carbon mesh or an alternative carbon
      material. The above structures may be supported by a base 40 of
      rigid, non-reactive, non-electrically conductive material, such as
      the polymer sold in block form under the brand name Teflon(R).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] All of the various components described above in the second
      embodiment of the rechargeable cell 20 may be secured in a housing
      50 forming a container. The components may be secured together and
      to the housing 50 by various securing mechanisms such as nuts 42,
      44 that help secure the lower ends of the current-collector rods
      32, 34 to the base 40 and nuts 48 that help secure the upper ends
      of the current-collector rods 32, 34 to the housing. Spacer
      elements 46 press the electrode stack together while allowing
      oxygen to reach the cathode 24. The anode current-collector rod 32
      extends through and helps secure the position of the separator 25
      and the anode current-collector 30 while the cathode
      current-collector rod 34 extends though and helps secure the
      position of the separator 25 and air cathode 24. The anode 22 is
      secured at least in part by being sandwiched between the separator
      25 and anode current-connector 30. The housing 50 may contain a
      quantity of oxygen or air 52 for reaction with the air cathode 24.
      The housing 50 may have an orifice or aperture 54 through which
      oxygen or ambient air 52 is introduced into the interior of the
      housing 50. A removable orifice cover 56 may be used to seal the
      orifice 54 until injection of oxygen or air is desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In either the first or second embodiment described above,
      the lithium anode 12, 22 is formed of lithium metal, a
      lithium-metal based alloy, a lithium-intercalation compound, or
      lithium titanate (Li2TiO3). As used herein, the term
      "lithium-intercalation compound" means those substances having a
      layered structure that is suitable for receiving and storing
      lithium compounds for later use (such as in a reaction). Thus,
      these materials may also be considered "lithium-storage
      materials." These lithium-intercalation, or lithium-intercalating
      compounds, are typically types of carbon. Lithium titanate
      functions similarly to a lithium-loaded intercalation compound
      when used as an anode material in a battery cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The air cathode 14, 24, described in more detail below, is
      predominantly a porous substrate, and may be infused with an
      oxygen-reduction catalyst to facilitate the oxygen reaction at the
      air cathode. Suitable oxygen-reduction catalysts comprise at least
      one of electrolytic manganese (IV) dioxide, ruthenium (IV) oxide,
      copper (II) oxide, copper (II) hydroxide, iron (II) oxide, iron
      (II,III) oxide, cobalt (II,III) oxide, nickel (II) oxide, silver,
      platinum and iridium.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The separator 25 is preferably made of a non-conductive
      polymer. The non-conductive polymer material may be porous, for
      example, in the nature of a sponge, so as to effectively hold the
      electrolyte described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] An embodiment of a cell constructed in accordance with the
      teachings of the invention is sealed in an enclosure wherein
      oxygen or air is injected to a predetermined pressure. Suitable
      operating pressure is in the range from about 0.1 atm to about 100
      atm, and an optimum range is from about 0.5 atm to about 20 atm.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Referring to FIG. 3, a cell assembly 120 is comprised of a
      lithium metal, lithium alloy, or lithium intercalation anode 112
      that is sandwiched between two separators 125. The anode terminal
      130 is connected to the specific anode. The separators 125 may be
      composed of a conductive or non-conductive polymer and may be
      porous or nonporous. Air electrodes 114 are adhered to the
      separator via chemical bonding (such as surface modifications or
      doping) and/or physical bonding (such as by using pressure or
      gluing agents). The air electrode 114 is comprised of a carbon
      component, a polymer binder component, and a catalyst component.
      Specific additives such as lithium peroxide may or may not be
      included. The cathodes are connected via electrical structure 136.
      The cathode terminal 134 is either connected to the cathode via
      chemical or physical processes or may be embedded within the
      cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Reference is now made generally to FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, which
      are schematic representations of a cell assembly 120 placed within
      a bag container 200 to form a completed, sealed cell 300 in
      accordance with the present invention. First, reference is made
      specifically to FIG. 4, in which a bag 200 made of multilayer
      polymer and metal laminate is pre-sealed completely on three sides
      and has a fourth side that is partially pre-sealed. A suitable
      polymer is polypropylene, such as the thin-sheet polypropylene
      product manufactured and sold by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and
      Company under the trademark DuPont(TM) Surlyn(R). In FIG. 4,
      sealing is indicated by spaced-apart double lines with
      cross-hatching which double lines extend across the lower-most
      edge 210 and parallel side edges 212, 214. The fourth side, which
      is an upper-most edge in the orientation of FIG. 4, has an opening
      216 along a portion of its length adjacent a sealed portion 218 of
      the upper-most edge. The partially-sealed bag essentially forms a
      pouch that is open at the top. An inner seal 220 extends parallel
      to one sealed side edge 212 for a substantial distance. The inner
      seal 220, parallel side edge 212 and partial seal 218 of the
      upper-most edge form a substantially U-shaped cavity. The
      upper-edge partial seal 218 seals a shaft 232 of a hypodermic
      needle 230 in the U-shaped cavity. The hypodermic needle 230 has
      an uppermost end 234 that is adapted for receiving an instrument
      for injection of a gas. The uppermost end 234 is particularly
      adapted for receiving a syringe (not shown) through which oxygen
      or air (that contains oxygen) is infused into the hag 200. Prior
      to placement of the needle 230 in the bag 200, the upper end 234
      of the needle 230 may be sealed with epoxy or by other known means
      to prevent moisture from being introduced into the bag (because of
      the undesirable interaction of water with lithium). After ensuring
      that the cathode is not peeling from the separator, the cell
      assembly 120 is soaked in the electrolyte for at least 5 to 10
      minutes, and then inserted (as shown by the direction arrow 3)
      into the preassembled pouch/partially sealed bag 200 with the
      anode current-collector tab 130 and the cathode current-collector
      tab 134 extending outwardly of the upper edge of the bag 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Referring now to FIG. 5, after the cell assembly 120 has
      been inserted, the bag container 200 is sealed across the
      current-collector mesh tabs, thus forming the completed upper-most
      seal 226. The fully-sealed bag 200 is then removed from the glove
      box and oxygen or air is injected into the bag. For example, a
      syringe (not shown) may be connected to the upper end 234 of the
      needle 230 so as to penetrate the sealed (epoxy or otherwise)
      opening and inject oxygen or air 5 into the bag 220.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Referring now to FIG. 6, after oxygen 5 has been injected
      into the bag 200, the partial inner seal 220 is fully extended
      between the upper-most sealed edge 226 and lower-most sealed edge
      210 of the bag 200, thus segregating the needle shaft 232. Sealing
      may be accomplished through use of a heat-sealing device commonly
      known as an impulse sealer. The needle-containing portion of the
      bag then may be removed by simple cutting, trimming, or other
      conventional means leaving a completed, sealed cell 300 in
      accordance with the teachings of the invention.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Electrolytes Containing Alkylene Additive</b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] In one embodiment, the invention modifies the lithium film
      that forms on a lithium electrode to produce a film that is
      conducive to lithium cycling (that is, discharging and recharging
      the cell). The film is modified by providing an electrolyte
      containing one or more additives that react with the electrode
      surfaces to form a surface-stabilizing film that is conducive to
      cycling.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] An electrolyte for a battery cell typically comprises a
      salt dissolved in a solvent, often water. The invention employs a
      non-aqueous, organic-solvent-based electrolyte including a lithium
      salt and an alkylene additive. A non-aqueous electrolyte is used
      to avoid the damaging effects that water has upon lithium.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A suitable lithium salt for producing the electrolyte
      comprises at least one of lithium hexafluorophosphate, lithium
      tetrafluoroborate, lithium hexafluoroarsenate, lithium
      perchlorate, lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide, lithium
      bis(perfluoroethylsulfonyl)imide, lithium triflate, lithium
      bis(oxalato)borate, lithium
      tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate, lithium bromide, and
      lithium iodide. For convenience, the following table provides

      [0056] To form the electrolyte solution, one or more of the above
      salts is dissolved in a solvent. Salt concentrations may range
      from 0.01-5 molar, but the preferred range is 0.5-1.5 molar.
      Examples of suitable solvents include two solvent mixtures: 1:2

      ether") and 1:2 (w:w) propylene carbonate and 1,2-dimethoxyethane
      (PC:DME).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Other suitable electrolyte solutions that may be employed
      in the invention are electrolyte solutions that are typically used
      for lithium-ion batteries. Such electrolyte solutions contain
      solvents that are based upon carbonates, esters, ethers, amines,
      amides, nitriles and sulfones. Such solvents include propylene
      carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl
      carbonate, ethylene carbonate, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diethyl
      carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, gamma-butyrolactone, sulfolane,
      1,3-dioxolane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, diglyme,
      tetraglyme, diethyl ether, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran,
      tetrahydropyran, pyridine, n-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfone,
      ethyl methyl sulfone, ethyl acetate, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl
      sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and methyl formate.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Suitable proportions of alkylene additives range from less
      than 1% up to 10% by weight based on the weight of the electrolyte
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The additive for the non-aqueous, organic-solvent-based
      electrolyte comprises an alkylene compound. Suitable alkylene
      compounds are capable of dissolving in the electrolyte solution
      and also capable of polymerizing when coming into contact with
      lithium metal. Suitable alkylene compounds are alkylene
      carbonates, alkylene siloxanes, and combinations of alkylene
      carbonate and alkylene siloxane.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Suitable alkylene carbonates are vinylene carbonate,
      butylene carbonate, and a combination of vinylene carbonate and
      butylene carbonate. Vinylene carbonate, which for convenience is
      sometimes herein abbreviated as "VC," has the following structural
      formula:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0061] A suitable alkylene siloxane is a polymerizable silane such
      as triacetoxyvinylsilane. Triacetoxyvinylsilane, which for
      convenience is sometimes herein abbreviated as "VS," has the
      following structural formula:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Organosilicon-Containing Electrolyte</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] In a second embodiment, the electrolyte used in the lithium
      air cell contains at least one organosilicon compound. Such
      compounds have been found to improve the reversibility of
      batteries. Silicon-based electrolytes are advantageous due to high
      conductivity, safety, and favorable electrochemical and chemical
      properties. Thus, silicon-containing electrolytes represent a
      growing area of interest as a means for improving the safety of
      lithium air batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Preferably, the organosilicon compound is a silane compound
      or a siloxane compound. The term "siloxane" technically describes
      a class of compounds containing alternate silicon and oxygen atoms
      with the silicon atoms bound to hydrogen atoms or organic groups.
      Silanes are compounds containing silicon-carbon bonds, analogous
      to alkanes. However, the terms "silane" and "siloxane" are often
      used interchangeably and incorrectly in the literature, and, for
      the purposes of this disclosure, these terms are not meant to be
      limited to the literal definitions thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Preferred organosilicon compounds for use in the
      electrolyte according to the invention are those containing
      polyethylene oxide (PEO) side chains. Most preferred organosilicon
      compounds are trimethylsilane compounds having Formula (1) below,
      in which "n" is an integer representing the number of ethylene
      oxide units in the molecule and may range from 1 to about 20.
      Other preferred compounds are silanes containing more than one PEO
      side chain on the central silicon atom, including silanes having
      two, three, and four PEO side chains on the central silicon atom.
      Substituents on the silicon which are not PEO side chains may be
      hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups having at
      least one carbon atom (methyl), or other substituted or
      unsubstituted organic groups. It is also within the scope of the
      invention for the electrolyte to contain more than one
      organosilicon compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The electrolyte further contains a salt, preferably a
      lithium salt as previously described. Preferred salts are LiBOB
      and LiTFSI. In a preferred embodiment, the electrolyte contains
      only the organosilicon compound with salt dissolved therein,
      preferably at a concentration of about 1 molar. No additional
      solvent is present in the electrolyte in a preferred embodiment.
      The electrolyte may contain additional organosilicon compound(s)
      and/or task specific additives in amounts of up to about 10 weight
      percent based on the total weight of the electrolyte. Such
      additives are known in the art or may be determined by routine
      experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Anode, Air Cathode, and Separator: General Construction and
        Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      [0066] Suitable anode materials include, but are not limited to
      lithium metal, lithium-metal-based alloys (for example, Li-Al,
      Li-Sn, and Li-Si), lithium-intercalating compounds that are
      typically used in lithium ion batteries (such as but not limited
      to graphite, mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) carbon, and soft carbon),
      and lithium titanate, which is also frequently used in lithium ion
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The invention also encompasses cathode materials and air
      cathodes, such as for lithium air and/or lithium oxygen batteries.
      An air electrode according to the invention contains a
      carbon-based porous electrode (containing cathode active material,
      binder, and optionally oxidation reduction catalyst) and the
      non-aqueous electrolyte containing a lithium salt and an
      organosilicon compound or an alkylene additive according to the
      invention. Exemplary and preferred lithium salts, organosilicon
      compounds, and alkylene additives have been previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The air cathode may be infused with or contain an oxidation
      reduction catalyst to facilitate oxygen reduction at the air
      cathode. Suitable oxidation reduction catalysts comprise at least
      one of electrolytic manganese (IV) dioxide, ruthenium (IV) oxide,
      copper (II) oxide, copper (II) hydroxide, iron (II) oxide, iron
      (II,III) oxide, cobalt (II,III) oxide, nickel (II) oxide, silver,
      platinum and iridium.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] An exemplary reversible air cathode according to the
      invention initially contains about 14% lithium peroxide (Li2O2);
      however, the cell will operate effectively if the air cathode
      contains from about 0.5% to about 50% Li2O2. The addition of
      lithium peroxide to the air cathode helps facilitate the
      preservation of initial porosity of the air cathode. The lithium
      peroxide initially attaches to the porous structure of the
      substrate and then, when the cell is charged, the lithium peroxide
      participates in a chemical reaction that causes it to vacate the
      porous substrate, thereby increasing the porosity of the
      substrate. The lithium peroxide thus helps preserve the intended
      initial porosity by essentially serving as a placeholder for open
      space in the air cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Battery capacity increases with increasing proportion of
      active carbon and porosity. Suitable porous cathode active
      materials include but are not limited to Calgon(TM) carbon
      (activated carbon), carbon black (such as Timcal Super P Li
      carbon), metal powders (such as Ni powder), activated carbon
      cloths, porous carbon fiber papers, and metal foams.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Suitable binders for the carbon electrodes include, but are
      not limited to, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyimide (PI),
      polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fluoropolymer resin,
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoropolymer resin, Teflon(R) AF
      amorphous fluoropolymers (Teflon(R) is a registered trademark of
      E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), and fluorinated ethylene
      propylene (FEP).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The separator included in the battery according to the
      invention is preferably made of a non-conductive polymer. The
      non-conductive polymer material may be porous, for example, in the
      nature of a sponge, so as to effectively hold the electrolyte
      described herein. Appropriate separator materials are well known
      in the art and need not be described. Thus, a battery according to
      the invention contains, in a preferred embodiment, electrolyte
      between the cathode and the anode, as well as electrolyte
      contained in the separator and in the air cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The term "air" as used herein is not intended to be limited
      to ambient air, but includes other combinations of gases
      containing oxygen as well as pure oxygen. As previously noted
      herein, oxygen is a reactant in the electrochemical process of the
      invention and references to the term "air" are meant to imply that
      it is the oxygen in air that is applicable. Thus this broad
      definition of "air" applies to all uses of that term herein,
      including but not limited to lithium air, air battery, air
      cathode, and air supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] It is to be understood that the described invention may
      include a battery that has not yet formed the active material of
      the anode or a battery which includes a preformed anode containing
      active material. When the battery does not yet include active
      anode material, the active anode material is formed upon initial
      charging of the battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The invention provides a lithium air battery (battery cell)
      having an electrolyte that is non-volatile, stable in contact with
      metallic lithium, stable against cathode oxidation during lithium
      air charging and able to improve the round-trip charge/discharge
      efficiency. The invention also provides a battery having an
      electrolyte that contains at least one organosilicon compound,
      which provides high conductivity, safety, and favorable
      electrochemical and chemical properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0076] The invention will now be described in connection with the
      following, non-limiting examples. It should be understood,
      however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details
      set forth in the example. Parts and percentages set forth herein
      are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Production of Air Cathode using PVDF Resin Binder</b><br>
      <br>
      [0077] Cathodes were prepared by milling 3 g KS10 graphite
      (carbon), 3 g Super P(R) Li (carbon black, Timcal SA/Timcal
      AG/Timcal Ltd Corporation of Switzerland), 0.75 g vapor-grown
      carbon fiber (VGCF) 24 LD carbon fiber (such as the carbon
      nanofibers manufactured by Pyrograf Products, Inc., an affiliate
      of Applied Sciences, Inc.), 2.09 g Kynar(R) PVDF, 1.16 g EMD
      (electrolytic manganese dioxide, MnO2), and 70 g ZrO2 milling
      media with 130 mL acetone in a ZrO2 jar at 300 rpm for 17.5 hours
      in a planetary mill. The milling media was removed by passing the
      resulting slurry through a wire screen. Cathodes were cast by
      spreading the slurry at a depth of 20 mil wet thickness onto a 19
      cm*39 cm sheet of 0.2 oz/yd&lt;2 &gt;(6.8 g/m&lt;2&gt;) non-woven
      carbon veil. The cathodes were allowed to dry under a cover with a
      [1/4]'' wide slot down the center, and cut into individual
      cathodes using a punch. The cathodes were then weighed and a group
      having a narrow mass range was selected to minimize variation due
      to the cathode during observation and testing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Production of Air Cathode using PTFE Resin Binder</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] An air cathode was prepared using a fluoropolymer resin
      binder as a negatively charged, hydrophobic colloid, containing
      approximately 60% (by total weight) of 0.05 to 0.5 [mu]m
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin particles suspended in water
      containing approximately 6% (by weight of PTFE) of a nonionic
      wetting agent and stabilizer. To produce a Teflon(R)-bonded cell,
      a Calgon(TM) carbon (activated carbon, Calgon Carbon
      Corporation)-based air cathode was prepared by first wetting 14.22
      g of Calgon(TM) carbon (activated carbon), 0.56 g of Acetylene
      Black (carbon black pigment), and 0.38 g of electrolytic manganese
      dioxide with a 60 ml mixture of isopropanol and water (1:2 ratio).
      The electrolytic manganese dioxide is an oxygen-reduction
      catalyst, optimally provided in a concentration of 1% to 30% by
      weight; ruthenium oxide, silver, platinum, or iridium could have
      been used as alternatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Next, 2.92 g of Teflon(R) 30 (60% Teflon(R) emulsion in
      water) were added to the above mixture, mixed, and placed in a
      bottle with ceramic balls to mix overnight on a roller-run jar
      mill. Alternatively, the slurry could be planetary milled for 6
      hours. After mixing, the slurry/paste was dried in an oven at
      110[deg.] C. for at least 6 hours to evaporate the water and yield
      a dry, fibrous mixture. The dry mixture was again wetted by a
      small quantity of water to form a thick paste, which was then
      spread over a clean glass plate (or polyester sheet). The mixture
      was kneaded to the desired thickness as it dried on the glass
      plate. After drying, it was cold pressed on an
      Adcote(TM)-brand-adhesive-coated aluminum mesh at 4000 psi for 3
      minutes. To remove any cracks in the paste, the cathode assembly
      was passed through stainless steel rollers. The cathode was then
      cut into smaller pieces such that the active area of the cathode
      was 2'' by 2''. A small portion of the aluminum mesh was exposed
      so that it could be used as the cathode current-collector tab.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Cell Assembly</b><br>
      <br>
      [0080] Cell assembly was performed inside of an argon-filled glove
      box to reduce or eliminate undesirable effects on the lithium
      electrode that are caused by water (particularly water vapor, or
      moisture, in air).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The cathode was wetted by a non-aqueous, organic-solvent
      based electrolyte including a lithium salt and an alkylene
      carbonate and/or an alkylene siloxane additive. Specifically, the
      electrolyte contained lithium hexafluorophosphate dissolved in a
      mixture of propylene carbonate and dimethyl ether to a 1 molar
      concentration (1M LiPF6 in PC:DME). A pressure-sensitive, porous
      polymeric separator membrane, such as Policell type B38 (product
      of Policell Technologies, Inc.) was loaded with a non-aqueous,
      organic-solvent based electrolyte including a lithium salt and an
      alkylene additive (vinylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, or an
      alkylene siloxane such as triacetoxyvinylsilane. The
      electrolyte-loaded separator membrane was placed on the cathode
      with the shiny side of the membrane facing away from the cathode.
      Next, thin lithium foil was placed on the shiny side of the wetted
      separator, and a 1.5 cm by 4 cm strip of copper mesh is placed
      along one edge of the thin lithium foil (to serve as an anode
      current-collector tab), away from the aluminum-mesh cathode
      current-collector tab. Another cathode piece wetted by the
      electrolyte and covered with a second electrolyte-loaded separator
      was placed directly on top of the lithium foil and copper-mesh
      strip. This is an example of a "double-cell assembly," illustrated
      schematically in FIG. 3, because there is a single substantially
      planar anode flanked on either side by a substantially planar
      cathode. FIG. 3 illustrates the arrangement of a pair of
      spaced-apart air cathodes 114, each having a separator 125
      separating the cathodes 114 from the centrally-disposed, thin
      lithium foil anode 112. An anode current-collector tab 130 extends
      from the anode 112. A cathode current-collector tab 134 extends
      from one of the cathodes 114 and a cathode current-collector
      connector 136 connects the current collector portions of the
      cathodes 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The double-cell assembly was laminated on a hot press at
      100[deg.] C. and 500 lb pressure for 30 to 40 seconds. After the
      sample was withdrawn from the press, the heat-activated separator
      bound the sample together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Production of Completed, Enclosed Cells</b><br>
      <br>
      [0083] Completed, enclosed cells were produced comprising a cell
      assembly placed in an enclosure with an electrolyte and then
      activated for use. The cell assembly comprises the
      cathode-anode-separator assembly, such as the double-cell assembly
      described above. Although the example described above is based
      upon a double cell, the teachings of the invention are equally
      applicable to a single-cell configuration or a multiple-cell
      configuration other than the single anode-dual cathode
      configuration described. The completed cells were also assembled
      in a glove box to isolate the components.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Various samples of completed cells were prepared for
      testing, in which the liquid electrolyte employed contained no
      additive or one of two general types of additives: (a) 2% by
      weight VS (triacetoxyvinylsilane, a polymerizable silane according
      to the invention) or (b) 5% by weight VC (vinylene carbonate, an
      alkylene carbonate additive).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Liquid electrolytes used for testing were 1 M solutions of
      lithium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI) or lithium
      hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6). The lithium salts were used in
      solvent mixtures containing a 1:2 (w:w) ratio of propylene
      carbonate and tetraglyme (PC:Tetraglyme) or a 1:2 (w:w) ratio of
      propylene carbonate and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (PC:DME). Cells
      constructed in accordance with the teachings of the invention were
      sealed in an enclosure wherein oxygen or air was injected to a
      predetermined pressure, preferably about 0.1 atm to about 100 atm,
      and more preferably about 0.5 atm to about 20 atm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Testing of Inventive and Comparative Cells</b><br>
      <br>
      [0086] Embodiments of cells incorporating the teachings of the
      invention and comparative cells were tested to compare their
      performances. Three performance characteristics were tested: Rest
      Voltage Before Cycling, Discharge Voltage During Second Cycle, and
      Charge Voltage During Second Cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIGS. 7-9 are box-plot graphs of data recorded for these
      three characteristics. A "cycle" that is referred to in the
      testing described herein refers to the period in which a
      fully-charged cell is discharged to a predetermined level and then
      re-charged to maximum capacity. Charge to more than 4.6V will
      enhance the desired decomposition of Li2O2. Suitable voltage
      ranges for charging and discharging are 4 to 4.8V for charging and
      3 to 1.5V for discharging. Increasing charging voltage
      significantly increases the reversibility of the battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The results of testing were compared and analyzed utilizing
      the statistics methodology known as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
      Measurements taken during the second cycle exhibited differences
      that were considered to be statistically significant and have been
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Referring to FIG. 7, therein is shown a box-plot graph of
      rest voltage, in volts (V), before cycling for cells tested. The
      rest voltage (V) for each cell was recorded at the end of the
      initial rest (or "pre-charging" period, prior to the first
      discharge). Cells containing the VS additive and the VC additive
      showed increases in rest voltage relative to the non-additive
      cells, which increases are statistically significant by ANOVA.
      Although the rest voltage for the VS sample appears higher than
      for VC in the box plot of FIG. 7, review using ANOVA principals
      indicates that they are statistically indistinguishable.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Referring now to FIG. 8, therein is shown a box-plot graph
      of discharge voltage (V) during the second cycle. This is a
      representation of the average voltage discharged or dissipated in
      the second cycle. Battery cells that did not contain an additive
      according to the present invention gave a statistically higher
      voltage than cells containing the VC additive according to the
      invention. However, discharge voltage for cell embodiments
      containing the VS additive according to the invention were
      indistinguishable from discharge voltage for cells containing no
      additive and the discharge voltage for cell embodiments containing
      the VC additive according to the invention was indistinguishable
      from the discharge voltage for cells containing the VS additive
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Referring now to FIG. 9, therein is shown a box-plot graph
      comparing charge voltage (V) during a second cycle, that is, the
      voltage (V) that was required to fully charge the cells. The
      charge voltage for the second cycle was lowest for cell
      embodiments containing VC additive, second lowest for cell
      embodiments containing VS additive, and highest for cells
      containing no additive.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] When the VS additive was utilized in combination with a
      nonvolatile, liquid electrolyte such as 1 M LiTFSI in 2:1
      (PC):tetraglyme, the VS additive served to increase the round-trip
      efficiency by reducing the charge voltage. Round-trip efficiency
      is a tool that may be used to compare the effectiveness of one
      rechargeable cell to another. Round-trip efficiency may be
      described as a ratio of the total discharge energy Edis
      (watt-hours) that is dissipated by a cell during a cycle as
      compared to the total energy Ech (watt hours) required to be
      applied to fully re-charge a cell after discharge during a cycle.
      The relationship may be described mathematically as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] wherein<br>
      n=cycle number<br>
      Edis=Total energy discharged during the cycle "n."<br>
      Ech=Total energy that is applied to re-charge a battery cell at
      the end of the preceding cycle, that is "n-1."<br>
      <br>
      [0096] As noted above, Round-Trip Efficiency is expressed as a
      percentage (%).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The invention provides a cell that requires a lesser amount
      of charge energy Ech, thus increasing the round-trip efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Comparative Example 1<br>
      <br>
      [0098] For testing, a standard carbon based cathode was coupled to
      lithium metal anode via a porous propylene separator (Celgard) to
      form a lithium/oxygen battery. The electrolyte solution was
      comprised of propylene carbonate (PC) and tetraglyme in a specific
      ratio with LITFSI at one molar. As shown in FIG. 10, the cell
      showed a symmetric charge/discharge voltage vs. time profile,
      indicating reversibility. However, over the course of 20 cycles,
      the fade rate of this cell was near 50% per 20 cycles. Upon
      disassembly of the battery, the cell components and both
      electrodes appeared to be intact, which indicated that the fading
      mechanisms were related to the electrolyte solution.<br>

      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation and Testing of Inventive Cell Containing
        PEO-Silane Electrolyte</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0099] A battery cell was prepared in which an air cathode was
      cycled versus lithium metal anode using an electrolyte containing
      an organosilicon compound having Formula (1) in which n=2
      (obtained from Argonne National Labs, IL.) The electrolyte was
      composed of LiTFSI salt dissolved in 1NM2 organosilicon solvent to
      1 molar. The cycling data was recorded on a Maccor battery tester
      and is presented in FIG. 11. Virtually no observable fading
      occurred over the first 20 cycles. Without wishing to be bound by
      theory, it is believed that this stability is due to the stability
      of the silane solvent from nucleophilic attack by the superoxide
      anion. The superoxide anion is present in the cell because it
      participates in charge and discharge electrochemical reaction in
      Li-O2 cells. In the case of PC based electrolyte solvents, the
      superoxide anion nucleophilically attacks ethereal carbon in PC
      leading to its decomposition. The effect is especially pronounced
      at higher cell voltages.<br>

      An anode environment mitigates undesired effects of oxygen upon
      the anode of a lithium-oxygen electrochemical cell. As a means of
      mitigating oxygen effect, a lithium anode and an air cathode are
      separated from one another by a lithium-ion-conductive electrolyte
      separator including material having low oxygen permeability that
      reduces the amount of oxygen that contacts the anode. As another
      means of mitigating oxygen effect, a cell comprises
      lithium-affinity anode material capable of receiving and retaining
      lithium in a state that is not significantly adversely affected by
      the presence of oxygen during cell charging and recharging and an
      air cathode separated by a lithium-ion-conductive electrolyte
      separator. Lithium-affinity material is capable of drawing lithium
      thereinto during charging of the cell and retaining the lithium
      substantially until discharge of the cell. A cell having a
      lithium-affinity anode may also have a lithium-ion-conductive
      electrolyte separator including material having low oxygen
