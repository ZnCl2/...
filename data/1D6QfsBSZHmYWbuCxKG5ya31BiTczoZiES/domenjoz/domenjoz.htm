      <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Pulsating
        through the air in much the same manner as employed by the
        jellyfish in propelling itself through water, a weird parachute
        artillery spotter is expected by its inventor, John A. Domenjoz
        of New York City, to supersede the ordinary kite-balloon in
        observation work during war.<br>
        <br>
        Greater maneuverability with resultant greater safety for the
        pilot, economy, and the elimination of ground crews are among
        the advantages claimed for this type of craft.<br>
        <br>
        The parachute artillery spotter consists of a flexible canopy
        mounted on a rigid annular frame, the upper portion being
        capable of an up and down motion which is obtained by means of a
        crank and piston rod. Driving power for the piston is supplied
        by a moderate sixes gasoline engine. A complicated set of valves
        centered about a circular aperture in the top of the canopy
        controls the air pressure exerted with the descendig stroke. In
        an emergency a parachute will lower the craft safely.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">This invention relates to
      aeronautical machines and in general is a power actuated apparatus
      of a type to take the place of the observation balloon for
      military use and consists of an improved design adn arrangement,
      inexpensive in its initial cost and in its operation and which
      possess many important advantages over the customarily employed
      observation balloon particularly as to maneuverability so as to
      materially improve the safety factor for the pilot and the
      machine.<br>
      <br>
      An important feature of the present invention consists of an
      improved motor driver means for obtaining the ascensional force
      comprising a flexible motive canopy, preferably of fabric and in
      the general form of a parachute, connected to be operated by a
      motor to operate in the nature of a flexible piston to produce
      power or lifting stroke as the result of suction above and
      pressure on the air beneath the motive canopy. The canopy is
      secured at its outer margin to a rigid frame or carrier for the
      motor and pilot and its central portion is connected to be
      vertically reciprocated by the motor and is provided with a
      one-way valve or shutter operative to close on the descending
      stroke of the canopy thus under the action of the motor to create
      an ascensional force governed by the speed of the motor. The pilot
      can thus readily control the elevation of the machine by varying
      the speed of the motor and additional means for vertical
      maneuvering is proivided in the form of a manually operated air
      valve to permit rapid change of elevation when desired while
      maintaining motor speed for prompt checking of the descent upon
      release of the valve.<br>
      <br>
      Further important features include the provision of a
      supplemental, readily releasable, parachute to check the descent
      upon failure of the motor thereby with safety allowing the use of
      a motive canopy of lesser diameter than would otherwise be
      practicable.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing and other important features and advantages of the
      present invention will be more fully understood by reference to
      the accompanying drawing wherein like reference characters are
      applied to the corresponding parts in the several views.<br>

      <br>
      In the approved construction embodying the features of my
      invention as shown in Figs. 1 to 4, a rigid carrier is shown
      comprised of a rectangular wherry 1 housing a driving motor m of
      the internal combustion type and having a compartment 2 for the
      pilot. The wherry is rigidly connected at each corner by means of
      posts or rods 4, with the annulus 5 formed to provide anchoring
      means for the outer margin of a flexible motive canopy 6, the
      central portion of which is connected to be vertically
      reciprocated by the motor m. To this end, the fly wheel 8 of the
      motor is provided with a crankpin 9 pivotally connected by pitman
      10 to vertically movable rod 11 fitted within a vertical bearing
      or bracket 12 supported at the top of the wherry. The rod 11 is
      pivotally conected as shown to the tubular extension rod 14 which
      is pivotally connected at 15 to a central hub of a movable annulus
      16; the hub portion as shown being connected by radial spokes 17
      to the annulus. Accordingly, operation of the motor will transmit
      a vertical reciprocating motion to the movable annulus 16 to which
      the inner margin of the flexible canopy is attached so that the
      canopy is vertically reciprocated from its inner margin.<br>
      <br>
      The movable annulus 16 is also formed with an upper hub portion 18
      supported by radial spokes 19 defining segmental openings 20
      adapted to be closed by segmental shutters 21 pivotally supported
      at 23 on the hub 18 in position to open upon swinging downwardly
      and inwardly and upon upward movement to close the openings 20 by
      engagement with the spokes 19 and under surface of the annulus.
      Each of the shutters is as shown provided with weighted rods 24
      affixed upon its upper surface and inwardly curved to obtain a
      counter balanced and improved shutter action. The hub 18 is also
      formed as shown with central openings 26 closed by a spring
      pressed valve 27 to which a cable 28 is attached and carried
      downwardly within the rod 14 to a point accessible to the
      operator. The flexible motive canopy 6 is secured to the
      respective rigid annulus 5 and the movable annulus 16 by means of
      cables 30 and 31 about which its margins are wrapped and secured.
      At 32 there is provided a suitable slide bearing for the rod 14
      supported upon spoke members 33, and 34 indicates tension
      connecting wires between the annulus and the wherry.<br>
      <br>
      The flexible motive canopy 6 is formed of a suitable fabric such
      as rubberized canvas in circular dome contour and of such diameter
      as required to produce the desired ascensional force when its
      central portion is vertically reciprocated by the motor, it being
      understood that upon the upward stroke of the motor and annulus 16
      the shutters 21 will open responsive to air pressure from above as
      shown in Fig. 1 wherein the parts are shown at the end of the up
      stroke and that upon the dowward stroke of the annulus 16 the
      shutters will automatically close so that upon the downward stroke
      a strong ascensional force is created as a result of suction above
      the motive canopy and air pressure beneath. Fig. 2 illustrates the
      position of the parts at the end of the power stroke.<br>
      <br>
      As will be understood from the structure described the elevation
      of the machine may be readily controlled by the throttling of the
      motor and for more rapid descent the pilot may at will open the
      valve 27.<br>
      <br>
      In Figs. 5 to 7, I have shown a desirable modified construction
      wherein for the purpose of added safety in the event of stoppage
      of the motor there is provided a supplemetnal parachute which may
      be manually released thus to supplement the parachute effect of
      the motive canopy and accordingly allow of the employment of the
      canopy of minimum dimensions with full parachute protection. As
      shown, the supplemental parachute is carried by the movable
      annulus 16 which is of modified form omitting the valve of the
      first described structure and having its upper hub portion
      provided with a cylindrical housing 40 for the supplemental
      parachute 41 folded in the usual manner with its outer margin
      connected by cords 42 to the housing at 43 while the inner
      marginal portion is folded over and into a central tube 44 and is
      connected to an ejector member 45 of tubular form slidably fitted
      at its bottom portion within a cylinder 47 secured to the lower
      hub 15 of the annulus. Beneath the ejector 45 there is positioned
      a compression spring 48 and the ejector member is held in position
      against the influence of the spring by a latch 49 from which an
      operating cable 50 is extended downwardly and accessible to the
      pilot. The ejector member has pivotally secured thereto at its
      upper portion at 52 an umbrella-like pilor parachute 53 to assit
      the full ejection of the parachute 41. The top of the housing 40
      is normally closed by pivoted flaps 54 pivoted at 55. The movable
      annulus as shown is further modified by the arrangement of a
      double series of air valve sutters 56-57 pivoted at 58-59 upon the
      annulus member. In emergency as will be understood the operator
      releases the hatch 49 allowing the spring to upwardly eject the
      parachute 41 with the pilot parachute assisting as shown in Fig.
      6.<br>
      <br>
      My improved machine, as will readily be appreciated, is
      particularly adapted for military observation with materially
      increased safety to the pilot as compared to the free balloon and
      further is advantageous by reason of compactness and portability,
      is economical as compared to the gas balloon. Its motive canopy is
      at all times available as a parachute for safety and with the
      manually controlled valve is active as a balanced parachute for
      improved control in maneuvering of the machine. As will be
      unerstood varied modification may be made in my improved machine
      without departing from the invention as defined in the appended
      claims... [ Not included here ]<br>
