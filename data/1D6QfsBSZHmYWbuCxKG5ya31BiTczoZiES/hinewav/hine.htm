            10,000 Mile Journey<br>
            <br>

      <br>
      The Mars rover Curiosity may be the most famous robot on – or off
      – the planet but an ocean-going bot named Papa Mau just set a
      world’s record for robot-kind by traveling more than 10,000 miles
      from San Francisco to Australia powered only by waves and
      sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid Robotics, the Silicon Valley startup that makes the
      surfboard-sized robot called a Wave Glider, announced Wednesday
      that Papa Mau arrived off the coast of Queensland, Australia, on
      Nov. 20 after surviving storms, sharks and 25-foot surf while its
      solar-powered sensor arrays collected terabytes of data on ocean
      and atmospheric conditions during the year-long journey.<br>
      <br>
      “The vehicle actually surprised me by the condition it was in when
      we pulled it out,” Graham Hine, Liquid Robotics’ senior vice
      president of product management, told me Wednesday.&nbsp; “The
      paint was scuffed and there was some wear on the bushings but
      other than that and a few critters attached here and there it
      could have kept going.”<br>
      <br>
      “We haven’t pushed the absolute endurance of these vehicles even
      with this ocean crossing,” he added, noting that barnacles, a crab
      and a spiny worm had hitched a ride on Papa Mau. “We would like to
      go further.”<br>
      <br>
      As I wrote last year in a feature story on Liquid Robotics, the
      company has deployed Wave Gliders around the world where they are
      undertaking missions for climate scientists, oil companies and the
      U.S. military:<br>
      <br>
      Packed in their 7-by-2-foot titanium-framed fiberglass bodies are
      terabytes of cellphone flash storage, a dual-core ARM processor
      running open Linux software, a battery pack, sensor arrays, a GPS
      unit, and wireless and satellite communications systems. It’s all
      powered by two off-the-shelf solar panels that cover the top of
      the Glider.<br>
      <br>
      But it is what’s unseen 23 feet below the ocean’s surface that
      makes the Wave Glider a perpetual motion green machine and that
      its investors are gambling will mint money from oil companies,
      scientists and the military. Tethered to the floating vehicle are
      six three and-a-half-foot “fins” attached to a rudder. As the fins
      tap the energy generated by the up-and-down motion of ocean waves,
      they move to propel the robot at speeds of up to 2 knots. No
      fuel—fossil or otherwise—required.<br>
      <br>
      The Wave Glider’s capacity to operate autonomously at sea for
      months on end gathering data from uncharted reaches of the ocean
      has attracted $40 million in funding, including $22 million from
      VantagePoint Capital Partners, a leading Silicon Valley green tech
      investor, and oil industry services behemoth Schlumberger.<br>
      <br>
      PacX, as Liquid Robotics calls the Pacific Ocean crossing, was
      conceived to demonstrate the Wave Gliders’ endurance while
      collecting data for scientists.<br>
      <br>
      Four Wave Gliders departed San Francisco on Nov. 17, 2011, for
      Hawaii where Papa Mau and a companion robot, Benjamin, headed to
      Australia while two others, Piccard Maru and Fontaine Maru, set
      off for Japan.<br>
      <br>
      Benjamin currently is passing the island nation of New Caledonia
      about 750 miles east of Australia and is expected to complete its
      journey early next year.<br>
      <br>
      The Japan-bound robots weren’t so lucky. Both experienced rudder
      problems that left them adrift. Hine says a ship has picked up
      Fontaine Maru and is bringing it back to the Liquid Robotics
      R&amp;D facility in Hawaii.<br>
      <br>
      “We want to see if we can modify it and restart its voyage to
      Japan,” he says. “We don’t know if there was something about the
      Japan crossing that caused the failure of if it was something with
      the units themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Papa Mau faced its own challenges, including long stretches of
      cloudy days that made it difficult for its two solar panels to
      collect enough energy to power its sensor arrays. But the robot
      sailed through equatorial waters without a hitch despite fears
      that strong currents and a lack of waves would take Papa Mau off
      course.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid Robotics customers can either buy the $100,000 robots or
      just the data they collect for an annual subscription that’s a
      fraction of the cost of dispatching a deep ocean ship and crew to
      do the same job.<br>
      <br>
      Hine says he hopes Papa Mau’s record-setting journey for an
      autonomous vehicle will be a persuasive sales pitch to potential
      clients.<br>
      <br>
      “This has been a technology where people haven’t believed it could
      do what we say it could,” says Hine. “So for this little robot to
      survive for thousands of miles for a year is a tremendous
      credibility jump for us.”<br>
      <br>
      As part of the mission supported by Richard Branson’s Virgin
      Oceanic and Google Earth, Liquid Robotics sponsored the PacX
      Challenge, which will award $50,000 grant from BP – one of the
      company’s clients – and six months of Wave Glider services to the
      scientist that comes up with the best research proposal based on
      the data collected during the Pacific crossing.<br>
      <br>
      On Wednesday, Liquid Robotics said that it had selected five
      finalists for the grand prize: J. Michael Beman of the University
      of California Merced, Nicole Goebel of University of California
      Santa Cruz, Andrew Lucas, of the Scripps Institution of
      Oceanography, Tracy Villareal of the University of Texas and
      oceanographer Elise Ralph of the Boston software company Wise
      Eddy.<br>
      <br>
      So what’s next for Papa Mau?<br>
      <br>
      Hine says his colleagues are considering an even bigger challenge
      for the robot. “We may end up putting it in a museum but I would
      like to see it retasked and sent off for another journey, such as
      circumnavigating Antarctica or heading from the South Poll to the
      North Poll and making it through Northwest Passage.”<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] This invention relates to devices that are subject to waves
      in the water, and that in some cases utilize the power of waves in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] As a wave travels along the surface of water, it produces
      vertical motion, but no net horizontal motion, of water. The
      amplitude of the vertical motion decreases with depth; at a depth
      of about half the wavelength, there is little vertical motion. The
      speed of currents induced by wind also decreases sharply with
      depth. A number of proposals have been made to utilize wave power
      to do useful work. Reference may be made, for example, to U.S.
      Patent Nos. 986,627, 1,315,267, 2,520,804, 3,312,186, 3,453,981,

      <br>
      [0007] Many of the known wave-powered devices ("WPDs") comprise
      (1) a float, (2) a swimmer, and (3) a tether connecting the float
      and the swimmer; the float, swimmer, and tether being such that
      when the vehicle is in still water, (i) the float is on or near
      the surface of the water, (ii) the swimmer is submerged below the
      float, and (iii) the tether is under tension, the swimmer
      comprising a fin or other wave-actuated component which, when the
      device is in wave-bearing water, interacts with the water to
      generate forces that can be used for a useful purpose, for example
      to move the swimmer in a direction having a horizontal component
      (hereinafter referred to simply as "horizontally" or "in a
      horizontal direction"). The terms "wing" and "fin" are used
      interchangeably in the art and in this application. [0008] It is
      desirable to position sensors and equipment in the ocean or lakes
      for long periods of time without using fuel or relying on anchor
      lines which can be very large and difficult to maintain. In recent
      years, the WPDs developed by Liquid Robotics, Inc. and marketed
      under the registered trademark Wave Glider&lt;(R)&gt;, have
      demonstrated outstanding value, particularly because of their
      ability to operate autonomously. It is noted that Wave
      Glider&lt;(R)&gt; WPDs are often referred to as Wave Gliders as a
      shorthand terminology. It is also noted that WPDs are often
      referred to as wave-powered vehicles ("WPVs").<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] A problem that arises with the known wave-powered devices
      is that they are difficult to transport, store, launch, and
      recover. Embodiments of the present invention provide a solution
      this problem by providing an assembly in which the tether and the
      wave- actuated component are nested closely to, and/or secured to,
      the float, thus making relatively compact assembly that can be
      maintained as a single unit until the time comes to launch the
      device on the water. A related solution, which is applicable when
      the tether, in use, is rigid, is described and claimed in detail
      in an application filed contemporaneously with this application
      and also claiming priority from U.S. Provisional Application Nos.
      61/453,871 and 61/535,116. That related solution, which can be
      used in conjunction with the solution of this invention, it is to
      make use of a tether which, before the device is placed on water,
      can be maintained in a position adjacent to the float and which,
      before or after the device is placed on water, can be moved from
      the adjacent position to an extended position in which the tether
      is at least in part rigid.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The Summary of the Invention and the Detailed Description
      below, and the accompanying drawings, disclose many novel
      features, each of which is inventive in its own right, and any one
      or more of which can be used in combination where this is
      physically possible. The different aspects of the invention
      identified below are no more examples of the broad range of
      inventions disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In a first aspect of this invention, an assembly comprises:
      (1) a float; (2) a wave- actuated component; and (3) a closure
      component having a first state in which it secures the float and
      the wave-actuated component together as an assembly that can be
      moved as a unit and a second state that permits the wave-actuated
      component to move away from the float. The assembly is configured
      to accept a tether having a first end connected to the float and a
      second end connected to the wave-actuated component, such that
      when the closure component is in the second state and the assembly
      includes such a tether, the float, the tether, and the
      wave-actuated component form a wave-powered device (WPD). [0012]
      When the float is placed on or near the surface of still water,
      the WPD has (a) the float floating on or near the surface of the
      still water, (b) the tether extending downwards from the float and
      under tension, and (c) the wave-actuated component being submerged
      below the float. When the float is placed on or near the surface
      of wave-bearing water, the WPD has (a) the float floating on or
      near the surface of the wave-bearing water, (b) the tether
      extending downwards from the float, and (c) the wave-actuated
      component being submerged below the float, and interacting with
      the water to generate forces that are transmitted to the tether.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The wave-actuated component is sometimes referred to herein
      as a "swimmer" or a "wing rack" (for those embodiments having
      multiple fins. It can comprise a fin system as disclosed in any of
      the documents incorporated herein by reference or any other
      mechanism that will interact with the water to generate forces
      that are transmitted to the tether.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a second aspect of the invention, a float having top,
      bottom, and side surfaces comprises float side components that
      extend downwards from the side surfaces to create a space defined
      by the bottom surface and the float side components. Such a float
      is, for example, useful in the first aspect of the invention
      because the defined space can enclose the wave-actuated component.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In a third aspect of the invention, a wave-actuated
      component comprises components that extend upwards from the
      wave-actuated component and that will interact with a float to
      register the wave-actuated component in relation to the float.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In a fourth aspect of the invention, a wave-actuated
      component comprises components that extend downwards from the
      wave-actuated component, and when the wave- actuated component is
      placed upon a horizontal surface, the components that extend
      downwards separate the surface from any part of the wave-actuated
      component that might otherwise be damaged by contact with the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In a fifth aspect of the invention, a wave-powered device
      comprises: (1) a float, (2) a flexible tether, and (3) a
      wave-actuated component, the tether connecting the float and the
      wave-actuated component. The float, the tether, and the
      wave-actuated component are such that, when (A) the device is in
      still water, (i) the float is on or near the surface of the water,
      (ii) the wave-actuated component is submerged below the float, and
      (iii) the tether is under tension, and (B) when the device is in
      wave-bearing water, the wave-actuated component interacts with the
      water to generate forces that are transmitted to the tether. In
      this aspect, the float comprises a winch that can be operated to
      change the length of the tether. [0018] In a sixth aspect of the
      invention, a wave-powered device comprises: (1) a float, (2) a
      flexible tether, and (3) a wave-actuated component, the tether
      connecting the float and the wave-actuated component. The float,
      the tether, and the wave-actuated component are such that (A) when
      the device is in still water, (i) the float is on or near the
      surface of the water, (ii) the wave-actuated component is
      submerged below the float, and (iii) the tether is under tension,
      and (B) when the device is in wave-bearing water, the
      wave-actuated component interacts with the water to generate
      forces that are transmitted to the tether, wherein the tether has
      at least one of the following characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      (1) the tether has a substantially flat configuration, for example
      with an average<br>
      thickness of 1-3 mm;<br>
      <br>
      (2) the tether is free from components that carry electrical
      currents and/or is free from components that carry signals of any
      kind;<br>
      <br>
      (3) the tether comprises a plurality of round tensile members;<br>
      <br>
      (4) the tether is a flat webbing constructed of a synthetic
      polymer, e.g., a polyamide,.<br>
      Spectran, Vectran, or Kevlar;<br>
      <br>
      (5) the tether is a flat webbing that is tensioned only along the
      leading edge thereof, thus reducing fluttering and bowing;<br>
      <br>
      (6) the tether is attached to the float at a hinge point that
      comprises a shaft and bushing arrangement such that the tether is
      not required to flex against its wide axis (pitch);<br>
      <br>
      (7) at the float, the tether is guided through a 90[deg.] twist,
      and then flexes in the pitch axis over a pulley with its axis
      level and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the float;<br>
      <br>
      (8) at the float, the tether is guided through a 90[deg.] twist,
      and then flexes in the pitch axis over a pulley with its axis
      level and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the float,
      wherein the pulley is crowned to increase the tension on the
      center of the tether to lessen the effect of the the 90[deg.]
      twist increasing the tension of the outer parts of the tether,
      relative to the center of the tether.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In an seventh aspect of the invention, a fin system for use
      in a wave-powered device of any kind, including the wave-powered
      devices disclosed in the documents incorporated by reference
      herein, has at at least one fm that rotates about an axis and that
      has a neutral position, and a control system for controlling the
      rotation of the fin, and the control system comprises: a first
      means that controls the rotation of the fin within a first range
      about a neutral position; and a second means that controls the
      rotation of the fm when the movement of the fins is outside the
      first range. In embodiments, the angular movement of at least one
      fin is primarily controlled by a first spring or other means when
      the movement of the fins is within a first range about a neutral
      position and is primarily controlled by a second spring or other
      means when the movement of the fins is within a second range that
      is outside the first range, wherein the second spring is stiffer
      than the first spring, thus making it more difficult for the fins
      to move within the first range. The movement can be controlled
      solely by the first spring or by a combination of first spring and
      a second spring.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Within the second range, the movement can be controlled
      solely by the second spring or by a combination of the first
      spring and a second spring. The system can include a stop that
      prevents the first spring from moving beyond a first limit. The
      system can include a stop that prevents the second spring from
      moving beyond a second limit, and thus prevents the fin from
      moving outside a second range. Either or both of the springs can
      be replaced by an equivalent means that may be mechanical or
      electromechanical. When using such a system, when the waves in the
      wave bearing water are small, the rotation of the fins is
      controlled by the first spring and only a little fluid force is
      needed to rotate the fins to an angle within an effective range.
      As the waves become larger, the second spring comes into play and,
      by preventing the fins from "overrotating" maintains the fins at
      an angle within an effective range. Excessive water forces can
      rotate the wing so that it dumps the load, thus protecting the
      system from overload.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In an eighth aspect of the invention, a method of obtaining
      information comprises receiving signals from, or recorded by, a
      WPD according to the first, fifth, or sixth aspect of the
      invention, or a WPD that comprises a float according to the second
      aspect of the invention, or a wave-actuated component according to
      the third or fourth aspect of the invention, or a WPD that
      comprises a fin system according to the seventh aspect of the
      invention. [0022] In a ninth aspect of the invention, a method for
      controlling a function of a WPD comprising sending signals to a
      WPD according to the first, fifth, sixth, or seventh aspect of the
      invention, or a WPD that comprises a float according to the second
      aspect of the invention, or a wave-actuated component according to
      the third or fourth aspect of the invention, or a WPD that
      comprises a fin system according to the seventh aspect of the
      invention. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Nesting</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] The assembly of the first aspect of the invention makes use
      of a float and a wave- actuated component that are designed to fit
      closely to each other, e.g., in a nested or bundled configuration.
      For example, the float can comprise components that extend
      downwards and fit around the swimmer, and/or the swimmer can
      comprise components that extend upwards and fit around the float.
      One or both of the float and the wave-actuated component can
      include clips that help to secure the float and the swimmer
      together. Alternatively or additionally, one or more separate
      components, e.g., straps, can secure the float and the wave-
      actuated component together. [0024] Fins forming part of the
      wave-actuated component can remain within, or extend beyond, the
      periphery of the float. This makes it easier for the float and the
      wave-actuated component to be handled as a single unit for storage
      and/or transport, before being launched as a WPD and can also
      facilitate recovery of the WPD. In some cases, the float and the
      swimmer can together form a package that can be handled as a
      single unit for shipping within recognized national and/or
      international weight and dimension restrictions. The combination
      of the float and the wave-actuated component can include the
      tether, so that, when the components are separated, there is a WPD
      ready for use. Alternatively, the tether can be absent from the
      package and be added to the assembly when the WPD is ready to be
      launched. The tether can comprise one or more rigid sections that
      can be folded, telescoped or otherwise collapsed, or a tether that
      can be wound up on a winch on the float.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In another aspect of the invention, a method of launching a
      WPD comprises (1 ) providing a WPD precursor that comprises a
      float and a wave-actuated component that are nested together, and
      a tether that is coiled and/or folded within the float and/or the
      wave- actuated component, and/or between the float and the
      wave-actuated component; (2) placing the WPD precursor on water;
      and (3) releasing the wave-actuated component from the float so
      that the wave-actuated component is submerged below the float and
      the tether is under tension between the float and the
      wave-actuated component.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In another aspect of the invention, a method of recovering
      a WPD that comprises a float, a wave-actuated component, and at
      least two tethers, that link the float and the wave- actuated
      component, the method comprising pulling one of the tethers
      upwards so that fins on the wave-actuated component have reduced
      resistance to upward motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In another aspect of the invention, a method of recovering
      a WPD that comprises a float, a wave-actuated component, and a
      tether that comprises at least one rigid section, the method
      comprising folding the tether upwards so that fins on the swimmer
      have reduced resistance to upward motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In another aspect of the invention, a WPD in which the
      tether is free from components that carry electrical currents
      and/or is free from components that carry signals of any kind. In
      this case, the wave-actuated component will generally also be free
      from electrical and electronic components. This reduces the danger
      that the performance of the WPD will be compromised by damage to
      the tether, particularly when making use of a tether that is
      flexible, since it is difficult to prevent failure of electrical
      wires in the tether, since the tether can be subject to large snap
      loads, and bending loads, resulting in damage to insulation
      surrounding electrical/electronic components, which in turn
      results in failure due to salt water incursion. Tethers without
      electrical wires can be thinner, and stiffer, and can have cross
      sections that make it easier to store the tether before the WPD is
      launched and/or to gather up the tether when the WPD is to be
      removed from the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the
      present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining
      portions of the specification and the drawings, which are intended
      to be exemplary and not limiting.<br>

        DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] FIG. 1 is a side view showing three images of a
      wave-powered water vehicle. The vehicle comprises a "float" 10
      resting on the water surface, and a "swimmer" or "glider" 20
      hanging below, suspended by a tether 30. The float 10 comprises a
      displacement hull 11 and a fixed keel fin 12. The swimmer
      comprises a rudder 21 for steering and "wings" or "fins" 22
      connected to a central beam of the rack 23 so as to permit
      rotation of the wings around a transverse axis within a
      constrained range, and provide propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In still water (shown in the leftmost panel), the submerged
      swimmer 20 hangs level by way of the tether 30 directly below the
      float 10. As a wave lifts the float 10 (middle panel), an upwards
      force is generated on the tether 30, pulling swimmer 20 upwards
      through the water. This causers the wings 22 of the swimmer to
      rotate about a transverse axis were the wings are connected to the
      rack 23, and assume a downwards sloping position. As the water is
      forced downward through the swimmer, the downwards sloping wings
      generate forward thrust, and the swimmer pulls the float forward.
      After the wave crests (rightmost panel), the float descends into a
      trough. The swimmer also sinks, since it is heavier than water,
      keeping tension on the tether. The wings rotate about the
      transverse axis the other way, assuming an upwards sloping
      position. As the water is forced upwards through the swimmer, the
      upwards sloping wings generate forward thrust, and the swimmer
      again pulls the float forwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Thus, the swimmer generates forward thrust when either
      ascending or descending, resulting in forward motion of the entire
      craft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Engaging and Securing Components of the Vehicle for Storage and
        Transport</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] Embodiments of the invention provide a technology for
      combining components of a multi-component wave-powered water
      vessel in a way that they can be stored or transported on land
      with minimal difficulty or damage.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] One of the elements of this technology is an engagement
      means, wherein the components are configured to fit together in a
      manner that provides lateral support one component to another, and
      thereby minimizes lateral movement of one against the other when
      fitted together. In a two-way engagement means, the components are
      also configured to provide support one component to another in the
      longitudinal dimension, and thereby minimize longitudinal movement
      of one against the other when fitted together.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Lateral engagement means and optionally two-way engagement
      means between a float (the vessel body traveling on or near the
      surface of the water) and a swimmer (the rack of wings or fins
      that travels under water and provides locomotive force) may be
      provided by configuring the float and swimmer so that they fit
      together one inside the other, or are configured so that
      projections from one component, the other component, or both
      receive and engage the other component.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In one such configuration, the swimmer has a smaller width
      and optionally a smaller length compared with the outermost edges
      of the float. The float is provided with a compartment or is
      hollowed out at the bottom to a depth whereby when the swimmer is
      secured to or contained within the hollow, the hollow conforms
      closely to the shape of the swimmer, thus providing lateral and
      potentially longitudinal stability. The roles of the components
      may be reversed, so that the float fits into a hollow in the
      swimmer. In another configuration, the swimmer has lateral beams
      or brackets on both sides that extend upwards to brace inwards
      against the sides of the float. The roles of the components may be
      reversed, so that the float has a lateral bracket on both sides
      that extends downwards to brace inwards against the sides of the
      swimmer. More complex configurations can also be designed where
      the float and swimmer are both provided with brackets, and the
      brackets interdigitate to provide lateral support and thereby
      minimize lateral movement of one against the other.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Another element of the technology is an integral securing
      means, whereby one component is secured against and either above
      or below another component in a manner that the components may be
      moved together on land without one component sliding against
      another. The securing means is integral in the sense that it is
      built into one component, the other component, or both, so that it
      is always present and not removed after deployment of the vessel
      into the water. In this way, it is made available to resecure the
      vehicle back on land after a course of duty on the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] One such integral securing means is a connection between
      the components that may connect the components at a distance, but
      can be reduced in the length of the connection until the
      components are urged against one another. For example, when a
      float suspends a swimmer by way of a tether, the float may be
      provided with a locking or ratcheting winch to draw the swimmer
      upwards against the bottom of the float. Alternatively or in
      addition, components of the vessel may be equipped with integral
      securing means such as a clasp, clamp, or bolt that mates with and
      may be secured against a complementary element of another
      component after the components are brought together.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIGS. 2 A and 2 A are perspective views from the upper left
      side of another wave- powered water vehicle having a different
      configuration. FIG. 2A shows the vehicle as it is deployed in the
      water. In this example, the float 10 is connected to the swimmer
      20 by two tethers 30. The float 10 comprises a displacement hull
      11 with a side panel 13 on each side. The rudder 14 is now placed
      on the float. Upward facing solar panels 15 generate electrical
      power to supply the electronics (not shown) that are contained in
      one or more sealed compartments 16. The electronics control
      navigation, and have an antenna 17 to transmit data and receive
      instructions wirelessly to other vessels and/or a control unit on
      shore. The swimmer 20 comprises a rack 23 now positioned to
      support the wings 22 on either side. The rack 23 comprises a side
      beam 24 on each side that is configured to engage the hull 11 of
      the float. The rack 23 also comprises downward facing support legs
      25 to support the entire vehicle from below when on land. [0058]
      FIG. 2B shows the vehicle when the swimmer 20 has been secured
      underneath the float 10 for transport or storage of the vehicle
      out of the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIGS. 3A and 3B are perspective views from the lower left
      side of the same two- tether wave-powered vehicle. FIG. 3 A shows
      the vehicle as it is deployed in the water. Each tether 30 is
      secured to the swimmer at a midpoint 31 on a transverse beam 27
      between the two side beams 24 of the rack 23. Each tether passes
      through an opening 18 in the hull 11 of the float so that they may
      be winched up together to lift the swimmer 20. The hull 11 also
      has four couplers 19 to secure the swimmer 20 to the float for
      transport.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 3B shows the vehicle as it is secured for
      transportation or storage. The swimmer 20 is secured to the hull
      11 of the float by retraction of the tethers that are joined at a
      midpoint 31 of two transverse beams 27, and closing the couplers
      19 against transverse beams in the swimmer.. The rudder 14 mounted
      on the float fits into a corresponding notch 26 on the rack 23 of
      the swimmer. The side beams 24 of the rack extend upwards to
      engage the sides 13 of the float.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In these figures, the side beams of the swimmer 20
      constitute an engagement means by extending upwards so that they
      may engage opposite side panels of the float. There are also two
      types of securing means. One type is the two winches for bringing
      the two tethers up and into the float. When they are drawn in so
      that the swimmer is in the upmost position, the swimmer is secured
      against the bottom of the float. The other integral securing means
      is the four couplers 19 on the bottom of the float, which lock
      onto transverse beams of the swimmer.<br>

      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 4 shows a model of a wave-powered water vehicle that
      has multiple tiers of fins. Each of the three tiers (20a, 20b, and
      20c) comprises a rack with a side beam on each side (24a, 24b, and
      24c), and transverse beams (27a, 27b, and 27c) between the to
      sides. The upper tier 20a, the middle tier 20b, and the lower tier
      20c are each secured to the tethers 30 at the midpoint 31 of the
      transverse beams 27. Each tether is mounted to a winch 32 in the
      float 10 to retract the three tiers against the float for storage
      or transport. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 5 A shows a cut-away view of the three tiers 20
      secured to the float 10. The winch 32 has been used to pull the
      tiers 20 against the bottom of the hull 11. The tiers 20 nest
      together so as to reduce the height of the vehicle when the
      components are secured against each other for transport or
      storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 5B shows a detail of the tiers nested together. The
      uppermost tier 20a has a side beam 24a of each side that extends
      upwards to engage the corresponding side panel 13 of the float
      from below, and extends downwards to engage the corresponding side
      beam 20b of the middle tier 20b from above. The middle tier 20b is
      narrower in width so as to fit between the side beams 24a of the
      upper tier 20a. The middle tier has a side beam 24b on each side
      that extends upwards to engage the corresponding beam 24b of the
      upper tier from below on the inside, and extends downwards to
      engage the corresponding beam 24c of the lower tier 20c from
      above. The lower tier 20c is still narrower in width so as to fit
      between the side beams 24b of the middle tier 20b. The lower tier
      has a side beam 24c on each side that extends upwards to engage
      the corresponding beam 24b of the middle tier 20b from below on
      the inside, and extends downwards to provide a support leg for the
      entire vehicle to rest on when out of the water for transport or
      storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Thus, each tier is nested into the one above it by being
      narrower in width. The difference is about two times the thickness
      of the side beams, so that the side beam of each tier may engage
      the side beam of the tier above it. Since there is a close
      tolerance between the outermost side of the middle and lower tiers
      with the inside of the side beam of the tier above, the tiers are
      engaged one to another. Since there is a close tolerance between
      the inside of the top tier with the outer panel of the hull, the
      nested racks are engaged with the float. They may be secured in
      position by way of the tether winches, a lockable coupling
      mechanism, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] As an alternative nesting and engagement means, the nesting
      of the tiers may be done the other way up, so that the bottom tier
      is the widest, and the next tier is narrower to the extent
      required for the side beams to engage the side beams of the tier
      below it from the inside. As a third alternative, the tiers have
      substantially the same width, and nest by having side beams that
      splay downwards to fit over the tier below.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 6 shows two wave-powered water vehicles, each with
      three tiers of wings. The nesting allows the tiers to be packed
      closer together, reducing the height of the vehicle secured out of
      the water so that the two may be transported or stored one on top
      of the other in a standard sized metal shipping container.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Wave-Powered Vehicle Having an Opening for Dispensing a Payload
        or Equipment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] In some instances, a wave-powered water vehicle of this
      invention may be wanted to dispense a large payload, or to lower
      equipment. For such purposes, the vehicle may be provided with a
      large opening (typically at or near the center of floatation)
      through which such payload or equipment may be dropped or lowered.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 7A shows such a vehicle in a perspective view from the
      lower right side.<br>
      <br>
      There is a plurality of racks 20 comprising propulsion wings 22.
      The racks are shown drawn against the bottom of the float 10 by
      retracting the tethers 30 up. into the float each using a winch
      32. All of the tiers of wing racks 20 and the bottom of the hull
      of the float 10 have been provided with openings 52 that
      substantially align downwards. This enables the user to deploy
      equipment 50 (such as monitoring or sensor equipment) or a payload
      through the hole either by dropping, or by lowering on a line 51
      that extends from a winch 53 or lowering motor that is aboard the
      float. <br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 7B shows a detail of the vehicle in a perspective view
      from the upper right side. Here, three tiers of wing racks 20a,
      20b, and 20c have been lowered to the downwards (propulsion
      providing) configuration using the tethers 30. Each of the three
      racks comprise an opening 52 made by omitting or cutting out a
      portion of the wings corresponding to the hole on each tier. Here,
      the wing racks are further stabilized and aligned above each other
      using guide wires 33 at the front and back of the racks. This
      helps align the opening in each rack 20 in rough seas so that the
      payload 50 may be passed on the line 51 directly through the holes
      52 without substantially disturbing any of the racks. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Catamaran Style Wave-Powered Vehicles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0071] FIGS. 8A, 8B, 8C, and 8D depict a wave-powered vehicle
      having a float comprising two floating elements or pontoons that
      track over the water in parallel one beside each other. FIG. 8A is
      a transverse cut-away view; FIG. 8B is a perspective from above
      showing solar panels on the top surface; FIG. 8C is a cut-away
      view down the middle; FIG. 8D is a perspective from below the rack
      of propulsion wings. The two pontoons are connected over the top,
      which provides a platform for mounting solar panels and electronic
      equipment. The cavity formed between the two pontoons provides a
      cavity that engages the swimmer from each side. Here, the swimmer
      is shown with a single wing rack, although multiple nesting wing
      racks can also be used. There are matching rudders at the end of
      each pontoon. In this example, there is also a propeller drawing
      power from a battery to provide locomotive power to the vessel
      when wave action is insufficient to drive the vehicle at the
      desired speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Figure 9 shows four catamaran-style wave-powered vehicles
      mounted on a truck. The vehicles are stored inside a shipping
      container mounted on a truck. In this drawing, the sides and top
      of the shipping container have been cut away to show the storage
      configuration. Sizing the swimmer or wing racks to be retractable
      between the two pontoons of each catamaran compacts the storage
      size. This allows four of the wave-powered vehicles to be stored
      and transported in a single standard-sized shipping container.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spring; Arrangement for Controlling Wing Rotation with
        Gradations Of Torque</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] FIGS. 10A and 10B show a two-spring arrangement for
      controlling the movement of a fin, which is part of a
      wave-actuated component such as is shown in FIG. 2A. The spring
      arrangement constrains upward and downward rotation of the fins
      within two ranges requiring increasing torque. FIG. 10A is an
      upper perspective of the spring arrangement on the foremost fin or
      wing (not shown) to the right side beam 24 from behind on the
      inside, with the fm removed. FIG. 10B is an upper perspective of
      the same spring arrangement from behind on the outside, with the
      beam drawn transparently and showing a portion of the fm.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The fin is rotationally mounted to the side beam 24 by way
      of an axle 40 that passes transversely through the fin 22 just
      behind the leading edge 221 with the elevator portion of the fin
      222 extending behind. The spring arrangement comprises a first and
      second springs 41 and 42. The first spring is wound around the
      axle 40 (shown in this example on the inside of the side beam 24.
      The first spring 41 extends from the axle at one end 411 to form a
      hook portion disposed to provide a point of attachment for the
      fin. In this embodiment, the other end of the first spring, not
      shown, is fixed to the side beam.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The second spring is also wound around the axle 40 in the
      same direction as the first spring 41. In this example, the second
      spring is thicker, and therefore stiffer, than the first spring.
      The second spring 42 extends from the axle at one end 424 to form
      a hook portion disposed to provide a point of attachment for the
      fin. The second spring 42 extends from the axle at the other end
      424 to form a hook portion disposed to travel between an upper
      stop 422 and a lower stop 423 mounted on the side beam 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] With this configuration, the first spring 41 is engaged to
      control the upward and downward rotational movement of the wing
      but the second spring is not- as long as the movement is within
      the range defined by the stops for the second spring. When the
      rotation of the wing goes beyond what is permitted by the stops,
      then the second spring 42 becomes engaged. As a consequence, the
      torque required to rotate the wing is now determined by both
      springs, and more torque is required to rotate the wing further in
      the same direction. <br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 11 is a graph showing the torque required to alter the
      angle of a wing of the vehicle in either direction from a neutral
      position. The torque required to operate the wing within the inner
      range is determined by the first spring alone, beyond which the
      torque required to alter the angle in either direction is
      determined by the combined torque of both springs. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Winch Design and Use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0078] In another aspect of the invention, a WPD includes one or
      more winches (or their equivalent) that can store and release a
      tether before the WPD is launched, and/or can control the length
      of the tether when the WPD is in use, and/or can gather up the
      tether when the WPD is taken out of use, e.g., removed from the
      water completely. Preferably, when using a winch, the tether is
      free from electrical connections. If the tether does contain
      electrical connections, the winch system is more complicated. For
      example, the electrical connections will need to exit the center
      of the winch spool with slip rings or similar devices. Tethers
      without electrical connections may be thinner, enabling more wraps
      and greater length on the same diameter spool of a winch. Through
      the use of one or more winches, it is possible to obtain one or
      more of the following advantages:<br>
      <br>
      (1) to optimize the distance between the float and the
      wave-actuated component,<br>
      depending on the actual expected wave and wind conditions (for
      example, longer to capture energy from slow, deep waves; shorter
      to reduce tether drag in high frequency wind chop).<br>
      <br>
      (2) to reduce the distance between the float and wait-actuated
      component in order to get over under-sea obstacles or to release
      the swimmer if it is stranded in shallow water.<br>
      <br>
      (3) to clean the tether, at regular or irregular intervals, by
      pulling the tether upwards through wipers, thus removing or
      reducing fouling which produces undesirable drag on the tether.<br>
      <br>
      (4) to simplify deployment and recovery, particularly when the
      float and the wave- actuated component are designed so that they
      can be close to each other, e.g., in a nested configuration, for
      example when the float and the wave-actuated component can form a
      single tight bundle which is suitable for shipping and/or storage
      and which can be easily deployed into an operating condition in
      response to physical and/or electrical and/or electronic commands.
      (5) when there are two tethers, to remove twist by using the winch
      or winches to pull both tethers upward.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIGS. 12A and 12B are drawings of a winch that may be used
      to raise and lower the tethers that attach the float to the
      swimmer or wing racks in a wave-powered vehicle of this invention.
      Typically, each tether has its own winch, which are coordinated to
      raise the swimmer simultaneously. FIG. 12A shows the winch with
      the cover closed. FIG. 12B is a perspective of the winch with the
      covering cut away to show what's inside. The tether 30 is rolled
      onto a spool 61 driven by a worm drive 63 attached to an electric
      motor 62. The tether winds and unwinds from the spool over a
      pulley 64 downwards through an opening 65 in the covering. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] The tether 30 is flat and streamlined, so it will not flex
      easily in the pitch axis. A 160mm OD spool may support 10m of
      tether if the tether is 2mm thick. To allow the tether to pivot in
      pitch, the entire winch assembly is mounted on bearings at either
      end so that it pivots along a center axis 66. It has a cylindrical
      cover that is foam filled to displace water. The float will have a
      corresponding cylindrical opening so that minimum empty space is
      allowed to fill with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Wipers (not shown) are positioned in the winch assembly to
      clean slime and scum off of the tether before it is wound on the
      spool. This removes bio-fouling and may periodically be done to
      improve vehicle speed performance. The tether may include magnetic
      markers and magnetic sensors, such as hall effect sensors, may be
      positioned to measure movement of the tether. Alternatively, the
      tether may have variable magnetic permeability and a magnet may be
      one side of the tether as it enters the winch area while a hall
      sensor is on the other side. Since scum may change the effective
      thickness of the tether, this system can help maintain the correct
      deployed length. Multiple e.g., Dual Tethers<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In another aspect of the invention, a WPD comprises a first
      tether that is attached (i) to the float at a first float
      location, and (ii) to the wave-actuated component (or swimmer) at
      a first swimmer location, and (2) a second tether that is attached
      (i) to the float at a second float location that is different from
      the first float location, and (ii) to the swimmer at a second
      swimmer location that is different from the first swimmer
      location, and the WPD has at least one of the following features
      (i.e., having one of the following features or a combination of
      any two or more of the following features):<br>
      <br>
      (1) At least one of the tethers is secured to a winch secured to
      the float. In one<br>
      embodiment, both tethers are secured to the same winch. In another
      embodiment, one of the tethers is secured to a first winch and the
      other secured to a second winch. Optionally, the winch is mounted
      so that it can pivot along a center axis.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The horizontal distance between the front of the float and the
      first float location is at most 0.3 times, preferably at most 0.2
      times, e.g., 0.05-0.15 times, the horizontal length of the float.<br>
      <br>
      (3) The horizontal distance between the rear of the float and the
      second float location is at most 0.3 times, preferably at most 0.2
      times, e.g., 0.05-0.15 times, the horizontal length of the float.<br>
      <br>
      (4) The horizontal distance between the front of the swimmer and
      the first swimmer location is at most 0.3 times, preferably at
      most 0.2 times, e.g., 0.05-0.15 times, the horizontal length of
      the swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      (5) The horizontal distance between the rear of the swimmer and
      the second swimmer location is at most 0.3 times, preferably at
      most 0.2 times, e.g., 0.05-0.15 times, the horizontal length of
      the swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      (6) At least one of the tethers has a substantially flat
      configuration, for example with an average thickness of 1 -3 mm,
      thus facilitating the handling of the tether, particularly when
      the tether is to be wound up on a winch. [0083] The use of dual
      tethers can reduce the likelihood that the tethers will become
      twisted; can enable a longer and narrower float shape (which
      reduces drag and increases speed); and by moving the connections
      and mechanisms associated with the tether to the fore and aft
      sections of the float, makes it possible to provide a larger
      central area of the float for payloads of all kinds, for example
      communications equipment and sensors and other scientific
      instruments. In addition, the use of two tethers can simplify
      recovery of a WPD. Recovering a WPD that has only a single tether
      can be difficult because pulling up on the single tether requires
      lifting the swimmer against the resistance of the fins to the
      water.<br>
      <br>
      When there are two tethers, pulling on only one of the tethers
      tilts the swimmer and the fins attached to it so that the
      resistance of the fins is reduced. This is true, whether or not
      the WPD makes use of a winch to shorten the tether.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] A WPD having a single tether generally has a tether
      termination assembly and load distribution structure at the center
      of the float, thus occupying the center of the float. The use of
      two spaced-part tethers frees up the center of float, which for
      many purposes is the most valuable part of the float desirable
      components. For example, the best part of the float for tall
      antennas is the center, where they can cast a shadow on at most
      half of solar panels mounted on the upper surface of the float
      (shading just part of a solar panel can completely disable it if,
      as is often the case, the cells are wired in series and shut off
      like transistors when dark.) Also, tall antennas have no steering
      effect on the float due to wind if they are at the center. When
      the WPD has two tethers, the center area of the float may be free
      for payloads with integrated antennas, i.e., antennas that are
      integrated with a dry box, or kept entirely within a dry area,
      thus reducing the danger that routing wires to the antennas will
      be damaged by moisture. In addition, placing most or all of the
      payload at the center of float makes it easier to balance the
      float fore and aft, and thus reduces the danger that the float
      will nose in or nose up.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] When the WPD has two tethers, the float preferably contains
      a means to steer the float, such as a rudder at the tail end of
      the float. The wave-actuated component (swimmer) provides thrust
      as it is lifted and lowered due to wave action. Torque from the
      float is transmitted to the wave-actuated component by the
      separation of the two tethers. The wave- actuated component thus
      points in the same direction as the float after a steering lag,
      caused by the inertia and fluid resistance to rotation of the
      wave-actuated component.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In one configuration, there is a fore tether and an aft
      tether, preferably on a relatively long narrow float. While the
      tethers are taut, the wave-actuated component is held parallel
      with the float. Particularly when the wave-actuated component is
      held relatively level, a spring and stop system can control the
      angle of fins well, so that the fins operate at a favorable angle
      of attack during up and down motions with various speeds and
      amplitudes. The wave-actuated component can for example have a
      parallel bar structure with fin support shafts crossing between
      bars like ladder steps. The position of the fins can for example
      be controlled by a spring assembly that maintains the fins as a
      desired neutral position, e.g., a level position, when the springs
      are not moving and that will resist upward and downward motion.
      The spring profile may be adjusted so that the wings tend to stop
      at an angle that is optimized for maximum lift.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In another configuration, there are right and left tethers.
      These may connect to a single monolithic wing. The wing can move
      as a unit, pivoting at a point at which both the tethers are
      attached to the wing. A weight below the wing causes it to nose
      down and dive forward when lowered. The attachment point to the
      tethers is forward of the center of wing area so that the wing
      will nose up and pull forward when raised by the tethers. As in
      the fore- aft configuration the rudder that steers the float, also
      indirectly steers the glider by the separation of the two tethers.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In other configurations, 3 or 4 tethers may be used to
      stabilize the glider. This is useful especially in large systems.
      On the other hand, the presence of too many tethers is undesirable
      because each tether represents additional drag.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Communications and Control</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0083] FIG. 13 is a is a block diagram of a control system of the
      type that might be used in any of the WPDs discussed herein for
      directing the WPD along a desired path. This figure duplicates
      FIG. 5 in the above-referenced U.S. Patent No. 7,371 ,136.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] FIG. 14 is a block diagram schematically showing a
      representative WPD's on-board electronics and some of the ways
      that the representative WPD communicates with outside entities. As
      mentioned above, the WPD uses satellite location systems and radio
      to communicate data back to an operator and to receive navigation
      and other commands, and has on-board computers and sensors that
      allow it to navigate or hold position autonomously, without
      regular human interaction or control.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The float contains core electronics including: satellite
      position sensor (GPS), radio communications (preferably sat-comm
      such as Iridium), an orientation sensing means such as a magnetic
      compass, batteries, navigation controller that uses information
      from the GPS and compass to control the rudder and steer the
      vehicle. The float may also include solar panels and various
      payload electronics such as environmental sensors or observation
      equipment such as radio monitors, cameras, hydrophones. All core
      electronics may be housed in the same enclosure, preferably at the
      tail end of the float. By keeping all the core electronics
      together, there is no need for wet connectors or cables in the
      core system. This is great reliability benefit, (solar panels and
      winches will connect with wet connectors - solar can be redundant
      so one connector can fail without taking the system down and
      winches are not necessary for basic functionality.) Since the GPS
      and sat-comm antennas are short, they will not shade the solar
      panels. Also the tail end is the least frequently submerged part
      of the float.(Submersion obscures the antennas.) however, as
      discussed above, with dual-tether embodiments, it is possible to
      house electronics and the like at the center of the float because
      the tether connections are near the end.<br>

      [0086] The term "comprises" and grammatical equivalents (e.g.,
      "includes" or "has") thereof are used herein to mean that other
      elements (i.e., components, ingredients, steps, etc.) are
      optionally present. For example, a water vehicle " comprising" (or
      "that comprises") components A, B, and C can contain only
      components A, B, and C, or can contain not only components A, B,
      and C but also one or more other components. The term "consisting
      essentially of and grammatical equivalents thereof is used herein
      to mean that other elements may be present that do not materially
      alter the claimed invention. The term "at least" followed by a
      number is used herein to denote the start of a range beginning
      with that number (which may be a range having an upper limit or no
      upper limit, depending on the variable being defined). For example
      "at least 1" means 1 or more than 1, and "at least 80%" means 80%
      or more than 80%. The term "at most" followed by a number is used
      herein to denote the end of a range ending with that number (which
      may be a range having 1 or 0 as its lower limit, or a range having
      no lower limit, depending upon the variable being defined). For
      example, "at most 4" means 4 or less than 4, and "at most 40%"
      means 40% or less than 40 %. When, in this specification, a range
      is given as " (a first number) to (a second number)" or "(a first
      number) - (a second number)," this means a range whose lower limit
      is the first number and whose upper limit is the second number.
      For example, "from 5 to 15 feet" or "5-15 feet" means a range
      whose lower limit is 5 feet and whose upper limit is 15 feet. The
      terms "plural," "multiple," "plurality," and "multiplicity" are
      used herein to denote two or more than two items. [0087] Where
      reference is made herein to a method comprising two or more
      defined steps, the defined steps can be carried out in any order
      or simultaneously (except where the context excludes that
      possibility), and the method can optionally include one or more
      other steps that are carried out before any of the defined steps,
      between two of the defined steps, or after all the defined steps
      (except where the context excludes that possibility). Where
      reference is made herein to "first" and "second" elements, this is
      generally done for identification purposes; unless the context
      requires otherwise, the first and second elements can be the same
      or different, and reference to a first element does not mean that
      a second element is necessarily present (though it may be
      present). Where reference is made herein to "a" or "an" element,
      this does not exclude the possibility that there are two or more
      such elements (except where the context excludes that
      possibility). Where reference is made herein to two or more
      elements, this does not exclude the possibility that the two or
      more elements are replaced by a lesser number or greater number of
      elements providing the same function (except where the context
      excludes that possibility). The numbers given herein should be
      construed with the latitude appropriate to their context and
      expression; for example, each number is subject to variation that
      depends on the accuracy with which it can be measured by methods
      conventionally used by those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Unless otherwise noted, the references to the positioning
      and shape of a component of the vehicle refer to that positioning
      and shape when the vehicle is in still water. The terms listed
      below are used in this specification in accordance with the
      definitions given below.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] "Leading edge" (or leading end) and "trailing edge" (or
      trailing end) denote the front and rear surfaces respectively of a
      fin or other component as wave power causes the vehicle to move
      forward.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] "Fore" and "aft" denote locations relatively near the
      leading and trailing edges (or ends) respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] "Aligned" denotes a direction that lies generally in a
      vertical plane that is parallel to the vertical plane that
      includes the axial centerline of the swimmer. "Axially aligned"
      denotes a direction that lies generally in the vertical plane that
      includes the axial centerline of the swimmer. <br>
      <br>
      [0092] "Transverse" denotes a direction that lies generally in a
      vertical plane orthogonal to the vertical plane that includes the
      axial centerline of the swimmer. <br>
      <br>
      [0093] Where reference is made herein to a feature that
      "generally" complies with a particular definition, for example
      "generally in a vertical plane," "generally laminar," or
      "generally horizontal," it is to be understood that the feature
      need not comply strictly with that particular definition, but
      rather can depart from that strict definition by an amount that
      permits effective operation in accordance with the principles of
      the invention.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] The information disclosed and claimed below relates
      generally to the fields of vessel motility and autonomous
      operation. More specifically, it provides a module separate from
      an underwater vehicle that derives locomotive thrust from wave
      action and is capable of pulling the underwater vehicle between
      locations or through a current. BACKGROUND OF <br>
      <br>
      <b>THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) technology is currently
      under development for use in industry and the military. Autonomous
      devices are equipped to navigate under water without an operator
      on board, and without direct continuous input from a remote
      operator. Examples are illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,690,014
      and 5,675,1 16 (U.S. Navy), and in 8,205,570 and D578,463 (Vehicle
      Control Technologies Inc.). Devices currently in production for
      civilian industrial use are the REMUS 600(TM), manufactured by
      Kongsberg Maritime in Kongsberg, Norway; the HarborScan(TM) UUV,
      manufactured by Vehicle Control Technologies Inc., Reston VA,
      U.S.A.; and the BlueFin(TM) model 12D, manufactured by Bluefin
      Robotics Corp., Quincy MA, U.S.A.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another platform currently under development is the LDUUV
      (Large Displacement UUV) by the Office of Naval Research,
      Arlington VA, U.S.A. In a current embodiment, the LDUUV is
      approximately 20 feet long and weighs several tons, which limits
      its range and the durability of missions before maintenance or
      refueling. The Office of Naval Research has published the Navy
      research initiative ONR BAA 1 1 -025 describing future objectives
      of the UUV program.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A previously unrelated field of nautical technology is
      vessels that derive locomotive thrust from wave motion. As a wave
      travels along the surface of water, it produces vertical motion.
      The amplitude of the vertical motion decreases with depth; at a
      depth of about half the wave length, there is little vertical
      motion. The speed of currents induced by wind also decreases
      sharply with depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] <b>Various devices have been designed and proposed to
        harness wave power to do useful work. For example, U.S. Patent

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] This disclosure provides a new approach and new technology
      for providing auxiliary thrust and/or power generation to an
      unmanned underwater vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] An extension module (EXM) of this invention can be used
      with an underwater vehicle to provide a vessel combination with
      increased power durability and range of operation. One or more UUV
      tethers or other linkages interconnect the UUV with the EXM,
      thereby allowing the EXM to pull the UUV through a body of water,
      decreasing energy expenditure by the UUV. The tethers and
      couplings can also be configured so that the UUV can pull the EXM,
      for example, when the vessel combination is becalmed.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The EXM is any device or module that harvests horizontal
      thrust or propulsion directly or indirectly from wave motion. One
      such EXM comprises a float, a swimmer; and one or more EXM tethers
      connecting the float to the swimmer. The float is buoyed to travel
      on or near the surface of a body of water, and the swimmer is
      weighted to travel in the water below the float, hanging by the
      EXM tethers. The swimmer comprises fin surfaces that mechanically
      provide forward thrust when actuated by rising and falling of the
      swimmer in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The EXM-UUV vessel combinations of this invention may also
      comprise a cradle configured for securing on or within the UUV and
      configured to receive the EXM. The EXM may be reversibly drawn to
      and secured upon or within the UUV in a retracted configuration by
      retracting the tethers, for example, by operating tether winches
      aboard the EXM or the UUV. Buoyancy of the float may be decreased
      when the EXM is retracted to the UUV, and increased when the EXM
      is deployed from the UUV. The EXM may be released from the cradle
      into a deployed or extended configuration by reversing the
      winches, thereby unpacking the EXM and positioning it to harvest
      wave motion and tow the UUV.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] A UUV tether extended behind the EXM may be provided with a
      docking means by which the UUV may be joined to the EXM in a
      docked configuration, and released from the EXM in an undocked or
      independent configuration. The docking means typically has concave
      surfaces configured to accommodate and latch onto the front of the
      UUV, and is configured with vents to allow passage of water to
      decrease frontal drag when pulled by the EXM. <br>
      <br>
      [0015] The EXM may be provided with a means for converting solar
      energy to electrical power and/or a means for converting wave
      motion to electrical power. The EXM may store the electricity
      and/or supply electrical power to the UUV.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Aspects of this invention include but are not limited to
      the EXM-UUV combination in a retracted or deployed configuration,
      a wave-powered vessel adapted for use as an EXM for tethering to a
      UUV, a cradle configured for securing on or within a UUV and
      configured to receive a wave-powered EXM when retracted thereto,
      and a tether configured for attachment to an EXM comprising a
      reversible docking means for a UUV.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] This invention also provides a method of providing
      locomotive thrust to an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) by
      operating an extension module (EXM) that has been tethered to the
      UUV. The EXM is operated to derive locomotive thrust from wave
      motion, thereby pulling the UUV. In some instances, locomotive
      thrust of the EXM moves the UUV to a new location, or counters
      current flow so as to keep the UUV in substantially the same
      geographic location (referred to as hovering or loitering).
      Optionally, the motor or locomotion means within the UUV may be
      turned off while the UUV is being pulled by the EXM.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Where the UUV tether comprises a docking means for
      reversibly receiving the UUV, the UUV may detach from the UUV
      tether(s), locomote away from the EXM, and then reunite and
      reattach to the EXM by docking back to the docking means on the
      UUV tether(s). While attached or separate from the EXM, the UUV
      may perform a variety of commercially or militarily important
      missions, such as dispensing cargo or conducting measurements of
      the underwater environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Further aspects of the invention will be evident from the
      description that follows.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] This invention provides an Endurance Extension Module (EXM)
      for powering an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). The EXM
      converts wave motion to locomotive thrust, pulling the UUV from
      point to point or keeping it in place against an opposing current.
      The EXM may also supply the UUV with electricity for driving an
      electric motor or powering on-board electronics. The EXM can be
      retracted onto the UUV when not in use to minimize drag, or it can
      release the UUV for a subsequent rendezvous. The EXM- UUV
      combinations of this invention allow extended autonomous missions
      over wider territory for purposes such as surveying or monitoring
      conditions or delivering cargo.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIGS. 1A, IB, and 1C depict an example in which the EXM
      works like a back pack that can be installed on a standard
      production UUV 61, thereby improving its loiter capabilities. It
      is a modular system where the EXM is carried on a cradle 51 that
      can be installed when needed, and removed or jettisoned when it is
      not needed. The EXM comprises a float 11, a swimmer 31, one or
      more lines or tethers 41a and 41b that connect the EXM to the UUV,
      and a retraction mechanism (not shown). Besides providing
      locomotive power, the EXM can provide a platform for generating
      electrical power, projecting one or more antennae for
      communication, and projecting one or more surface- based sensors,
      detectors, or cameras. <br>
      <br>
      [0028] In this example, the float 11 supports solar panels 12 and
      an antenna 13. It contains flotation foam, or alternatively may
      contain adjustable buoyancy tanks such as air bladders that
      inflate. The swimmer 31 has fins 32 for converting wave motion to
      lateral thrust. When retracted, the EXM sits on top of the UUV 61
      in a compact package with minimal frontal area 54 so that it has
      minor impact on drag. In the packed configuration, the UUV can
      operate at high speed and depth below reach of the connecting
      lines 41a and 41b, carrying the EXM like a back-pack for later
      deployment to resume hovering mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 2 depicts another example in which the EXM has a
      tether 41 with a docking nozzle or receptacle 42 configured for
      mating with the front of the UUV. This allows the UUV to detach
      from the EXM and sprint away to fulfill a mission, and then redock
      with the EXM in quiescent mode. The EXM comes into play during
      mission loiter periods, or during periods of slow transit, or
      after mission completion and prior to recovery. When deployed, the
      EXM provides propulsion and power regeneration capability as well
      as surface communications. These examples are discussed more
      extensively in a later section of this disclosure<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] Depending on how it is configured, an EXM of this invention
      may provide the user with one or more of the following benefits:<br>
      - The EXM does not require and typically does not have any
      on-board solid, liquid, or nuclear fuel for locomotion. In a
      typical embodiment, wave power is converted mechanically to
      horizontal thrust, propelling the EXM through the water, which in
      turn tows the underwater vessel. Wave motion as a source of power
      is naturally occurring and inexhaustible.<br>
      - The EXM increases the endurance of an underwater vessel in the
      sense that it may be deployed for longer periods without refueling
      or servicing. This can increase the overall time and distance of a
      mission and the geographical range that may be surveyed or in
      which cargo may be deployed.<br>
      - The EXM enables an underwater vessel to adopt a hovering mode in
      the face of opposing current. Rather than using the resources of
      the motor and fuel cells aboard the underwater vessel, the EXM
      provides horizontal thrust to propel the vessel combination
      against the current to the extent needed to maintain the vessel in
      substantially the same geographical position. When the motor
      aboard the underwater vessel is not needed for propulsion, it may
      be turned off or secured to decrease wear and tear or attrition.<br>
      - The EXM can provide a source of renewable electrical power to
      the underwater vessel. As described below, electricity can be
      generated by solar panels atop the float and/or by harnessing wave
      motion, and then transmitted back to the vessel by an electrical
      connection associated with the tether, or by induction.<br>
      - The EXM can also provide a retractable surface platform for
      other activities, such as radio communication, surface or
      off-shore surveillance or monitoring, or surface cargo deployment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Wave motion as an energy source for vessel propulsion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] The EXM of this invention is a module separate from the
      UUV, and pulls the UUV in or through the water. The EXM derives
      some or all of its locomotive thrust from wave power. In
      principle, the wave power may be converted to electricity or other
      energy storage means, which can then be used to power a propeller
      or turbine. Usually for sustained use it is more efficient to
      convert wave motion directly by mechanical means to provide most
      or all of the horizontal propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 3 depicts in principle how wave motion can be
      approximated for many purposes as a linear superposition of
      roughly sinusoidal waves. The waves have varying wavelength,
      period and direction. As a wave moves horizontally along the
      surface, the water itself moves in roughly circular orbits of
      logarithmically decreasing diameter with depth. The vertical
      component, the horizontal component, or both may be harvested and
      converted into horizontal thrust for the purpose of propelling the
      vessel through the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Wave-powered vessels may be configured to exploit the
      motion between the tops and bottoms of waves at the sea surface in
      the following way. A vessel body is positioned at or near the
      surface, a submerged swimmer or glider component is positioned
      underneath, and connected to the vessel body by one or more
      tethers. As waves lift and lower the float portion, wings or fins
      on the submerged swimmer passively rotate so as to convert the
      relative motion of the surrounding water into forward thrust. The
      azimuth of the thrust vector can be directed completely
      independently of the direction of the waves by a rudder at the
      back of the swimmer. The wings have a short chord dimension to
      minimize lost motion between the up stroke and the down stroke,
      converting even very small waves into forward thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 4 is an upper side view of a wave-powered vehicle that
      illustrates this design. The vehicle comprises a float or vessel
      body 11 resting on the water surface, and a swimmer 31 hanging
      below, suspended by one or more tethers 21. The float 11 comprises
      a displacement hull 16 and a fixed keel fin 15. The swimmer
      comprises a rudder 34 for steering and wings or fins 32 connected
      to a central beam 33 of the rack so as to permit rotation of the
      wings around a transverse axis within a constrained range, and
      provide propulsion. The tethers 21 may be attached at either end
      by way of a winch 22 for retracting the swimmer 31 up to the float
      11 for purposes of storage or navigational adjustment and then
      deploying the swimmer 31 downwards for full operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In still water (shown in the leftmost panel), the submerged
      swimmer 31 hangs level by way of the tether 21 directly below the
      float 11. As a wave lifts the float 11 (middle panel), an upwards
      force is generated on the tether 21, pulling the swimmer 31
      upwards through the water. This causers the wings 32 of the
      swimmer to rotate about a transverse axis where the wings are
      connected to the rack 33, and assume a downwards sloping position.
      As the water is forced downward through the swimmer, the downwards
      sloping wings generate forward thrust, and the swimmer pulls the
      float forward.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] After the wave crests (rightmost panel), the float 11
      descends into a trough. The swimmer 21 also sinks, since it is
      heavier than water, keeping tension on the tether 21. The wings 32
      rotate about the transverse axis the other way, assuming an
      upwards sloping position. As the water is forced upwards through
      the swimmer, the upwards sloping wings generate forward thrust,
      and the swimmer again pulls the float forwards. Thus, the swimmer
      generates thrust when both ascending and descending, resulting in
      forward motion of the entire craft.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As an alternative to the float and swimmer combination,
      other wave powered vessel designs can be adapted for use as an
      EXM. By way of illustration, the vessel may comprise dual fins set
      in a side-by-side configuration beneath the bow. The fins convert
      wave energy into a dolphin-like kick that can propel a load of up
      to three tons at five knots. See Popular Mechanics magazine,
      October 2009. Alternatively, wave powered vessels may incorporate
      an adjustable sail and keel for aerodynamic and hydrodynamic shear
      force resolution for directional thrust. US 2009/0193715 Al . See

      Using an EXM to provide locomotive power to a UUV.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In its minimum configuration, an EXM-UUV combination of
      this invention will typically comprise two components: (1 ) an
      underwater component that is capable of travelling and operating
      without a human on board and without being attached to the EXM;
      and (2) the extension module that provides locomotive power to
      pull or drive the UUV across or through the water when desired
      instead of or as well as the UUV's on-board propulsion mechanism.
      The EXM derives part or all of its locomotive thrust from wave
      motion, either mechanically, or by conversion to and from an
      energy storage means such as electrical, gravitational, or
      chemical potential, or a combination of both direct mechanical
      conversion and through a storage means.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Referring to FIG. 1A, an underwater vessel 61 is depicted
      as having a hydrodynamically shaped nose or front 62, a
      substantially cuboid body 63, rear fins 64 for promoting even
      travel, and a propeller 65 or turbine for providing locomotive
      thrust when the vessel is operating by itself. The EXM-UUV
      configuration may be created by joining and securing an EXM
      carried by a cradle 51 on or within an underwater vessel 61 in a
      permanent or detachable manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Here, the cradle 51 is configured underneath to mate with
      the upper surface of the vessel 61. Lying on top of the cradle 51
      is the EXM comprising the float 11 and the swimmer (hidden beneath
      the float in this view). The float is depicted as having solar
      panels 12 on its upward-facing surface for producing electricity
      and an antenna 13 for wireless communication when the float is
      above the water. The cradle 51 is adapted on its upper surface to
      accommodate the swimmer and the float in compact retracted
      configuration. As an alternative, the vessel can be engineered
      from the outset to conform substantially to and thereby receive
      the EXM directly when the two are retracted together. The
      advantage of the cradle 51 is that it allows the EXM to be
      installed on a standard production UUV. The means of securing the
      cradle to the UUV can be selected so that the cradle may be
      affixed permanently, or so that it can be released or jettisoned
      under water, for example, to free up the UUV for a particular
      operation, or to create a decoy. <br>
      <br>
      [0041] In FIG. IB, the cradle 51 carrying the EXM is shown
      retracted onto the surface of the underwater vessel 61 to provide
      a configuration that is the most compact and protective. This
      conformation may be adopted for storage of the combination on land
      or for hydrodynamic travel under water.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 1C shows the combination when deployed in a body of
      water with the EXM positioned to tow the underwater vessel 61.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The EXM comprises the float 11 and the swimmer 31 which
      work together to convert wave motion to horizontal thrust. The
      swimmer 31 shown here is depicted as having a rack with a single
      central spine or beam 33 upon which the fins or wings 32 are
      mounted. In other configurations, the rack may have outer rails,
      with one, two, or more than two rows of fins. A single rack
      facilitates retraction onto the cradle, but there may be multiple
      racks configured for nesting. As before, the fins rotate over a
      limited range about an axis that is horizontally perpendicular to
      the rail so as to provide forward thrust as the swimmer 31 travels
      up and down as a result of wave action on the float 11. In this
      example, the float 11 is joined to the swimmer 31 by way of two
      EXM flexible or rigid tethers that are mounted fore 21a and aft
      21b. A plurality of tethers may be used in an EXM in preference to
      a single tether, so that the float 11 and swimmer 31 may track
      more closely together.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Winch systems to retract tethers 21a and 21b can be mounted
      on the float 11 or the swimmer 31. Winch systems to retract
      tethers 41a and 41b can be mounted on the swimmer 31, the cradle
      51, or directly on the UUV 61. Alternatively, in either case, by
      placing a winch at the middle of each tether for winding both
      ends, slip rings can be eliminated for the power and
      communications lines that deploy alongside one or more of the
      tethers.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The cradle 51 is depicted here as having a substantially
      flat surface 52 configured to mate with the EXM. A groove 53 down
      the center may be provided to promote the range of motion or
      retractabihty of the EXM. The cradle has a leading edge 54 that is
      designed to make both the cradle and the EXM frontally
      hydrodynamic when the EXM is retracted, thereby minimizing or
      substantially lowering hydrodynamic drag when the vessel 61 is
      being propelled by the onboard propeller 65. Depending on the
      dimensions and speed of the vessel, drag may be reduced so that
      the additional power needed to propel the vessel with the EXM on
      board is no more than about 20%, 10%, or even 5% of the power
      needed without the EXM or cradle attached.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The EXM is attached to the vessel by way of a fore 41a and
      aft 41b UUV tether between the swimmer 31 and either the float 51
      or the vessel itself 61. The tethers are compliant so as to
      decouple heave motions of the EXM from the UUV, decreasing form
      drag effects. Two or a plurality of UUV tethers keep the
      components in yaw, again promoting unified tracking and
      steerability. The vessel 61 will typically have its own rudder so
      as to be steerable when not operating with the EXM. The EXM may
      also have a rudder attached either to the float 11, the swimmer 31
      or both so as to provide steering when the EXM is towing the
      underwater vessel. Where multiple rudders are present, they may be
      controlled and coordinated by an on-board microprocessor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Deploying the EXM from the UUV</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] When the EXM is packed into a cradle atop the UUV as in
      FIGS. 1A and IB, it may be deployed as follows. The UUV will
      typically surface first, and confirm appropriate surface
      conditions exist for deployment. It will then activate the EXM by
      unlatching the restraints and allowing the connecting lines to pay
      out from the retraction winches. The float will remain at the
      surface where will be coupled to the ocean surface and will move
      up and down with the waves. The swimmer hangs below the float by 1
      -20 meters (typically 4- 8 meters) and will be pulled up and down
      through relatively still water. Wings on the swimmer pitch up and
      down, to generate thrust during both the up and down motions of
      the float, the tethers between the UUV mounting structure and the
      swimmer allows the swimmer to move up and down while the UUV
      remains at a relatively constant depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Once deployed, the UUV may steer the entire system using
      its existing rudder. In addition or instead (for example, if the
      UUV uses directional thrusters for steering) then a rudder may be
      installed on the float and/or the swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Depending on conditions and their operational capabilities,
      the EXM and UUV may be operated in other configurations. For
      example, when seas are becalmed or when the wave harvesting
      mechanism of the EXM is inoperative, the EXM may be retracted back
      onto the cradle or onto the UUV. Alternatively, in such
      circumstances, it may be desirable to leave the EXM on the
      surface, for example, to harvest solar power, maintain<br>
      communications, or continue operation of surface-mounted sensors.
      In this case, the UUV may contribute to or be solely responsible
      for any locomotion of the EXM-UUV combination (for example, for
      traveling to a new location or for hovering against an oncoming
      current). The components thus reverse their more usual roles, with
      the UUV traveling in front and pulling the EXM by way of the
      interconnecting tethers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dockable combinations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] For some missions, the UUV may be equipped to be reversibly
      detachable from the EXM while in operation. With this in place,
      the UUV may detach from the EXM in order to sprint to a new
      location for a particular activity. It may then navigate back to
      and dock with the EXM at the old location, the new location, or
      elsewhere as conditions permit.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 2 depicts an embodiment that facilitates operation in
      this fashion. The EXM is joined to the UUV by way of a single UUV
      tether or tow line 41 from the back of the swimmer 31 to a docking
      means 42 in which the vessel 61 may dock and be secured for
      towing. In this example, the docking means 42 is substantially
      cone shaped, configured with substantially concave shapes on the
      inner surface of the cone to mate with the substantially convex
      outer surface of the front or nose of the vessel 61. In this
      example, the docking means is also rendered more hydrodynamic by
      providing a plurality of vents for allowing the passage of water
      through the cone when not towing the vessel. Not shown are
      mechanical or magnetic couplers that secure the vessel 61 to the
      docking means 42 with a robustness sufficient to sustain the
      linkage during towing.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In operation, the vessel 61 detaches from the docking means
      42 mounted at or near the aft end of the UUV tether 41, operates a
      self-contained locomotion means such as a propeller 65 so as to
      travel away from the components of the EXM 11 and 31, optionally
      dispenses cargo or conducts measurements of the underwater
      environment in which the UUV is traveling, and then reunites and
      reattaches to the EXM by docking back to the docking means 42.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electricity Generation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0053] In addition to or instead of its role of towing the UUV, an
      EXM of this invention may serve the function of generating and
      optionally storing electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As shown in FIG. 1, a portion of the EXM that floats upon
      the water surface upon deployment from the UUV may be equipped
      with commercial grade photovoltaic cells, such as those
      manufactured by SunPower Corp., San Jose CA, U.S.A. Two solar
      panels each with an area of approximately 4.5 ft&lt;2&gt; can
      provide 10-13 Watts on average at mid- latitudes, corresponding to
      roughly 250 to 300 Watt hours harvested every day.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] As an alternative or in addition to solar panels, the EXM
      may be equipped with a means whereby wave power may be harvested
      and converted to electricity. This is further described in
      PCT/US2012/044729, which is hereby incorporated herein by
      reference. When wave motion is sufficiently high, enough power can
      be harvested not only to propel the vessel through the water, but
      also to provide ample electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Wave power can be converted to electricity directly by
      configuring the vessel so that the vertical undulations of the
      vessel are mechanically coupled to an electrical generator. As
      shown in PCT/US2012/044729, spring-loaded swing arms can be
      mounted on the float and connected to the tethers suspending the
      swimmer. Some of the wave motion is harvested as potential energy
      in the spring, which can then be converted to electrical power.
      Motion of the swing arms ultimately results in a mechanical force
      turning conductive wire or bar within a magnetic field, or turning
      a magnet through a conductor, thereby generating electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Another way of converting wave motion to electrical power
      is to harvest the horizontal movement of the water resulting from
      wave-powered locomotion. For example, a propeller or turbine may
      be oriented forwards or rearwards to harvest vertical movement
      through the water, and mechanically coupled to a rotating magnet
      conductor arrangement that plays the role of generator. The user
      has the option of configuring the generator to play a reverse
      role, being caused by electrical power to rotate in the opposite
      direction, thereby rotating the propeller or turbine so as to
      generate thrust. In this arrangement, the propeller generator
      system may be installed on the swimmer of the EXM, on the UUV, or
      both.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Harvested electrical power may be used to power
      electronics, charge a battery, or drive a motor for propulsion
      aboard the EXM. By electrically coupling the EXM to the UUV (for
      example, by a wire traveling through or near one of the tethers or
      wirelessly by electromagnetic induction or electrodynamic
      induction), the EXM can supply electricity to the UUV to power
      electronics, charge a battery, or drive a motor for propulsion
      aboard the UUV. Buoyancy and navigation<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Buoyancy of the UUV and the EXM may be chosen or adapted
      during operation, depending on the mission requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In one approach, the EXM (as a whole) is positively buoyant
      while the UUV is made negatively buoyant. This approach is best
      suited for an integrated EXM, where the UUV will not be required
      to operate with the EXM jettisoned. The negative buoyancy of the
      UUV can then be used to provide a downward pull on the swimmer
      such that it generates thrust during the down phase of motion.
      When retracted, the float may replace buoyancy components (often
      syntactic foam) that would normally be installed in the upper
      portion of the UUV to provide stability. This approach minimizes
      overall system displacement and thus drag.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In another approach, the EXM is neutrally buoyant. In this
      case it can be installed as a completely independent module. It
      may be installed on a UUV with minor modification, and may be
      jettisoned without requiring the UUV to make major adjustments to
      its buoyancy. The drawings show an EXM that is neutrally buoyant
      attached to an approximately neutrally buoyant UUV. If jettisoned,
      the EXM could swim autonomously to a collection location or act as
      a decoy while the UUV carries out a sub-surface mission.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] If appropriate, buoyancy of the EXM and/or the UUV may be
      made adjustable to adapt to operating conditions and objectives
      (for example, by expanding or compressing an inner cavity or
      releasing compressed gas). For example, the buoyancy of the float
      may be made adjustable so that buoyancy may be decreased when the
      EXM is retracted to the UUV, and increased when the EXM is
      deployed from the UUV. This can facilitate deployment of the EXM
      from its cradle and operation of the vessel combination following
      deployment.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] For self-directed navigation, the EXM-UUV combination may
      be equipped with a means of determining the geographical location
      of the vessel, a means for determining direction, a means for
      steering the vessel, and a means for operating the steering so
      that the vessel travels or stays at a target location. Electronics
      to sense the geographical location of a vessel can triangulate off
      a series of reference points. For example, the float may be
      equipped with a GPS receiver, and either the EXM or the UUV can be
      equipped with an electronic compass or gyroscope to determine the
      vessel heading. Positional data about the geographical location
      and the vessel heading is processed in a decision algorithm or
      programmed microprocessor aboard the EXM or the UUV, which may
      then provide navigation instructions. Consequently, the rudder or
      steering means adjusts to head the vessel in accordance with the
      instructions.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] When the EXM has at least one component that rides at or
      near the water's surface, it provides a platform for equipment of
      special use to the UUV. These include: (1) GPS positional
      receivers and other navigational equipment; (2) such detectors and
      sensors that operate beneficially at or near the surface (for
      example, to determine items, parameters, or activity in the
      atmosphere, by a surface-going vessel, or at an on-shore
      location); (3) wireless transmitters and receivers for radio
      communication (for example, to receive navigational instructions,
      mission parameters, or other commands, and to transmit data
      collected from detectors or sensors aboard the EXM and/or the
      UUV); and (4) batteries and storage capacity to supplement the
      capabilities of the UUV.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Proof of Concept</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] Predictive modeling indicated that in the deployed
      configuration, the EXM's wave propulsion system can reduce the
      total energy required to conduct a threshold mission profile by a
      UUV by 55%. The EXM's solar panel array can harvest an additional
      24% of the total energy requirement, resulting in a reduction of
      the objective mission profile's energy requirement by 79%. When
      the EXM is stored in a cradle aboard the UUV, it should have
      minimal impact on UUV sprint speed. Assuming that the EXM system
      is 9 inches tall and 4 feet wide when on top of the UUV, the
      additional frontal area is predicted to cost a modest 5.5%
      reduction in top speed. If the height of the stowed EXM is 12
      inches, then the top speed would be reduced by 7.7% to roughly 1
      1.25 knots. The decreased vessel speed would be more than offset
      by the increased range and mission duration that the EXM provides.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] FIG. 5 shows a replica of the autonomous underwater vessel
      REMUS(TM) 600. FIG. 6 shows results of a towing test using a mass
      model in place of a UUV. The mass model was a 10 feet long section
      of 24" diameter PVC tube 61. A hemispherical nose 62 was mounted
      to the front of the tube and the tail was left open. The tube was
      free flooded, with buoyancy provided by a smaller sealed tube
      mounted inside. The mass model was trimmed to be approximately 1
      lb. negatively buoyant. The open tail created vortex as it moved
      through the water, resulting in higher drag than a closed UUV with
      contoured fairing.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] An eight-foot long three-point bridle 43 with an eight-foot
      leader 41 was attached to the keel of the swimmer slightly aft of
      center. No attempt was made to optimize the tow- point
      configuration on the mass model. The buoyancy of the mass model
      was adjusted to achieve stable and level travel behind and
      slightly below the swimmer. The mass model and the water it
      entrained had a combined mass of 3640 kg. The leader 41 was used
      for attaching a prototype wave-powered EXM, comprising a swimmer
      31 attached by way of an EXM tether 21 to a float (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] FIG. 6 compares the speed of a prototype EXM towing a mass
      model (right side) with a structurally and functionally equivalent
      prototype EXM travelling alone. They simultaneously raced adjacent
      0.5 km square courses, thereby experiencing substantially the same
      sea conditions: 1 to 3 feet waves and 10 knot winds. Both the
      uncoupled EXM and the EXM pulling the mass model were able to
      navigate the course in good order. The speed of the EXM towing the
      mass model was 44% slower. This validates the utility of a wave-
      powered EXM for towing a UUV. Since the square course was short
      and the EXM slows during each turn, the reduction in speed was
      more than would typically occur in a typical patrolling scenario
      without frequent turns.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Drag and tow-bar pulling (drogue drag) forces increase with
      the cube of the scale factor. These forces balance out so that
      vessel speed is relatively insensitive to scale.<br>
      <br>
      Scaling up by a factor of three, the EXM should tow a 72" diameter
      tube with similar performance. With an EXM having an average speed
      of 1.5 knots, the 72" diameter tube would tow at a speed of 0.84
      knots. Performance may be improved by providing fairing on the UUV
      so that it is more hydrodynamic when being pulled by the EXM,
      while carrying the EXM, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Wave-powered vessels and modules are highly responsive and
      robust to extreme weather conditions. This was demonstrated when a
      Liquid Robotics brand Wave Glider&lt;(R)&gt; designated "G2" was
      encroached by hurricane Isaac in the summer of 2012. Isaac had
      sustained winds of 40 knots with gusts up to 74 knots and a low
      barometric pressure of 988.3 millibars. G2 had been outfitted with
      sensors to measure water temperature, wind speeds, barometric
      pressure, and air temperature. The eye of the storm passed 60
      miles to the east of G2, which rode out the storm and collected
      sensor data that provided new insights into hurricane activity.
      Time-lapsed maps showed a considerable drop in water temperature,
      suggesting that Isaac was vacuuming heat from the ocean surface.<br>

      <b>Glossary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0071] The terms "vessel", "watercraft", and [sea going] "vehicle"
      are used<br>
      interchangeably in this disclosure to refer to a nautical craft
      that can travel across and about any body of water at, near, or
      below the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] A "wave-powered" vessel or device derives at least a
      majority of its power for locomotion or electricity generation
      from motion of the water at or about a point of reference.
      Optionally, the vessel may also derive power from solar energy and
      other natural sources, and/or man-made sources such as batteries
      and liquid fuel powered engines. In this context, a "wave" is any
      upward and downward or side-to-side motion of the water at a point
      of reference on or near the surface (such as the center of
      flotation of a vessel).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A "vessel body" or "float" is a component of a vessel that
      travels on or near the surface of the water. It may have its own
      source of locomotive power and/or rely on being pulled by a
      submarine component. When configured to harness wave power, it has
      an overall density that is lighter than water.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] A "swimmer", "pod", "submarine component", "sub", "glider"
      or "wing rack" is a component of a vessel that travels below the
      surface of the water and below the vessel body, to which it
      provides locomotive power or propulsion. The swimmer may be
      equipped with a plurality of "fins" or "wings" that rotate upwards
      or downwards around an axle transverse to the direction of travel.
      Vessels may be configured with one multiple swimmers, typically
      joined to the same two or more tethers at different depths, each
      providing locomotive thrust in response to wave action, and
      optionally configured for nesting when retracted
      (PCT/US2012/029696). Thus, all the aspects of this invention
      deriving wave power from a swimmer includes or can be adapted
      mutatis mutandis to include two, three, or more than three
      swimmers or wing racks.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] An "underwater" vehicle is a vessel designed for traveling
      under the surface of a body of water to conduct certain
      activities. It is so classified while actually under the water,
      when on the surface, or on shore awaiting deployment. <br>
      <br>
      [0076] An "extension module" or "endurance extension module" (EXM)
      is a separate module tethered or otherwise attached to a
      self-propelling vessel for purposes of providing additional or
      supplementary propulsion, for providing electricity, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] An "unmanned" underwater vehicle, EXM, or other vessel or
      vessel combination is designed and configured to travel in most
      circumstances across or through a body without the need of a human
      on board (whether or not a human is present). Either alone or in
      combination with modules tethered thereto, it has a self-contained
      source of locomotive power.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] An "autonomous" underwater vehicle, EXM, or other vessel or
      vessel combination is self-guiding in its operation without
      needing a human on board or in constant active control at a remote
      location. Navigation may be controlled by a combination of
      sensors, electronics, and microprocessors aboard or at a remote
      location and in wireless communication with the vessel, in
      combination with periodic or occasional human or remote
      microprocessor input to set course or mission parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In the context of this disclosure, a "cradle" is a device
      component configured for securing on or within a UUV on one
      surface, and configured to receive an EXM on another surface. The
      cradle may have any shape that is consistent with this function.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Wave-powered vessels have been described in U.S. Pat. No.

      <br>
      [0012] A previously unrelated field of development covers large
      stationary systems near shore that use wave motion to generate
      electrical power for communities on land. U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,023
      discusses an apparatus for extracting energy from waves on water.

      Clément et al. in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 6 (5):
      405-431, 2002.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] This disclosure provides improved technology for
      manufacturing and deploying nautical craft that can travel and
      navigate on their own. A hybrid vessel is described that converts
      wave motion to locomotive thrust by mechanical means, and also
      converts wave motion to electrical power for storage in a battery.
      The electrical power can then be tapped to provide locomotive
      power during periods where wave motion is inadequate and during
      deployment. The electrical power can also be tapped to even out
      the undulating thrust that is created when locomotion of the
      vessel is powered by wave motion alone.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] One aspect of the invention is a wave-powered vessel that
      has a buoyant vessel body, a mechanical means for converting
      movement of the vessel body caused by wave motion to horizontal
      thrust; and an electrical generator for converting movement of the
      vessel body caused by wave motion to electrical power. Converting
      wave motion to horizontal thrust may be done in a configuration
      where an underwater component or swimmer is attached below the
      vessel body by one or more tethers. In this configuration, the
      swimmer is weighted to travel in water below the vessel body, and
      is configured to pull the vessel body by way of the tether. The
      swimmer has fin surfaces that mechanically provide forward thrust
      when actuated by rising and falling of the swimmer in the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The on-board electrical generator may comprise a means for
      converting vertical movement of the vessel body caused by wave
      motion to electrical power, a means for converting horizontal
      movement of the vessel body through water to electrical power, or
      both. Shown in the figures is a wave-powered vessel where the
      electrical generator comprises a piston powered by a swing arm
      that moves from a horizontal to a vertical position in accordance
      with the vertical movement of the vessel body. The swing arm is
      mechanically connected to a swimmer weighted to travel in water
      below the vessel body. Optionally, the swimmer may be adapted so
      that motion of the fin surfaces may be dampened to increase
      electrical power generated by the electrical generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Another type of electrical generator comprises a rotatory
      fin or turbine powered by horizontal movement of the vessel body
      through the water. In this case, the rotatory fin or turbine is
      adapted to generate electrical power when rotated in one
      direction, and to act as a motor providing horizontal thrust to
      the vessel through the water when rotated in the opposite
      direction. Further types of electrical generators for harnessing
      swave powers are detailed later in this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Wave-powered vessels according to this invention typically
      have an electrically powered motor to provide horizontal thrust
      that powers the vessel through the water. There is also a battery
      configured to store electrical power generated by the electrical
      generator and to feed electrical power to the motor to provide
      propulsion. Optionally, the vessel may have one or more solar
      panels that also supply electrical power to the battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The battery may be used to power an inboard or outboard
      electrical motor at any time there is reserve electrical power and
      it is desirable to increase the sped of the vessel. For example,
      the battery can power the motor during periods where the motion in
      each full wave cycle is inadequate to provide sufficient
      horizontal thrust to the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Another aspect of the invention is a wave-powered vessel
      with locomotive thrust powered alternately by wave motion and by
      electrical power so as to buffer the trust powered by the wave
      motion. The electrical power is supplied by a battery, which in
      turn is charged up by a system that converts wave motion to
      electrical power, as already outlined.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Another aspect of this invention is a wave-powered vessel
      configured for deployment from shore. The vessel is kept in
      compact form, and launched by way of the electric motor to deeper
      water, whereupon the other components of the vessel are deployed
      outward and downward. A vessel of this nature typically has a
      buoyant vessel body, a swimmer configured to retract and be
      secured against the vessel body, one or more tethers connecting
      the float to the swimmer, an electrically powered motor configured
      to propel the vessel through the water; and a battery supplying
      power to the motor, having sufficient capacity to power the vessel
      from shore to a location where the swimmer can be deployed. Again,
      the swimmer is weighted to travel in the water below the vessel
      body, and is configured with fins to pull the vessel by way of the
      tether when actuated by vertical movement.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Such a vessel may also have a releasable tow buoy. The
      vessel body and the tow buoy are configured so that the tow buoy
      may be releasably housed within the vessel body while on shore,
      and pulled behind the vessel body after the vessel is deployed.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The vessels of this invention are ideal for use in
      autonomous operation (without a human attendant on board). The
      vessel has electronics configured to sense the geographical
      location of the vessel. There is also a microprocessor programmed
      to determine the vessels current location, and steer the vessel
      from its current location towards a target location.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Further aspects of the invention will be evident from the
      description that follows.<br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] This invention provides watercraft that derive both
      locomotive thrust and electrical energy by wave motion. Detailed
      illustrations of the invention include a vessel that harvests the
      power of vertical movement using tethers attached to a
      spring-loaded suspension device. Wave energy is converted to
      potential energy in the springs, which is then used to drive an
      electricity generator. In another example, the vessel has a
      propeller that can be driven backwards as a generator when in
      motion so as produce electrical power. Electrical energy obtained
      by either of these means may be used to power electronics or
      stored in a battery for later use. The stored energy can be used
      to provide propulsion on calm days when wave action does not in
      itself provide enough power for the vessel to travel at the
      desired speed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Converting Vertical Wave Power to Locomotive Thrust</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] One feature of the watercraft of this invention is the
      ability to use wave motion to drive the vessel from place to place
      across a body of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Wave motion can be approximated for many purposes as a
      linear superposition of roughly sinusoidal waves of varying
      wavelength, period and direction. As a wave moves horizontally
      along the surface, the water itself moves in roughly circular
      orbits of logarithmically decreasing diameter with depth. This is
      shown in FIG. 1A. The orbit at the surface has a diameter equal to
      the height of the wave. The orbital diameter at depth is a
      function of wave length:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Hy=Hse&lt;-2[pi]y/L &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where L is the wave length, Hs is the surface wave height
      and Hy is the orbital diameter at depth y below the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Vessels can be configured to exploit the difference in
      motion between Hs and Hy, for example, in the following way. A
      vessel body is positioned at or near the surface, and a submerged
      swimmer or glider component is positioned at depth y, and
      connected to the vessel body by one or more tethers. As waves lift
      and lower the float portion, wings or fins on the submerged
      portion passively rotate so as to convert the relative motion of
      the surrounding water into forward thrust. The azimuth of the
      thrust vector can be directed completely independently of the
      direction of the waves by a rudder at the back of the glider. The
      vessel has multiple wings each with a short chord dimension. This
      minimizes lost motion between the up stroke and the down stroke
      and enables successful conversion of even very small waves into
      forward thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 1B is a side view of a wave-powered vehicle that
      illustrates this principle. The vehicle comprises a float or
      vessel body 10 resting on the water surface, and a swimmer 20
      hanging below, suspended by one or more tethers 30. The float 10
      comprises a displacement hull 11 and a fixed keel fin 12. The
      swimmer comprises a rudder 21 for steering and wings or fins 22
      connected to a central beam of the rack 23 so as to permit
      rotation of the wings around a transverse axis within a
      constrained range, and provide propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In still water (shown in the leftmost panel), the submerged
      swimmer 20 hangs level by way of the tether 30 directly below the
      float 10. As a wave lifts the float 10 (middle panel), an upwards
      force is generated on the tether 30, pulling the swimmer 20
      upwards through the water. This causers the wings 22 of the
      swimmer to rotate about a transverse axis were the wings are
      connected to the rack 23, and assume a downwards sloping position.
      As the water is forced downward through the swimmer, the downwards
      sloping wings generate forward thrust, and the swimmer pulls the
      float forward. After the wave crests (rightmost panel), the float
      descends into a trough. The swimmer also sinks, since it is
      heavier than water, keeping tension on the tether. The wings
      rotate about the transverse axis the other way, assuming an
      upwards sloping position. As the water is forced upwards through
      the swimmer, the upwards sloping wings generate forward thrust,
      and the swimmer again pulls the float forwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Thus, the swimmer generates thrust when both ascending and
      descending, resulting in forward motion of the entire craft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Autonomous Navigation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] A wave-powered vessel may be configured to navigate across
      a body of water autonomously (without human attendance), and to
      perform its own power management.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Self-directed navigation is possible when the vessel is
      equipped with a means of determining the geographical location of
      the vessel, a means for determining direction, a means for
      steering the vessel, and a means for operating the steering so
      that the vessel travels or stays at a target location. The
      steering means is typically a rudder that turns sideways against
      the water so as to cause the vessel to spin towards a new heading.
      Alternatively or in addition, it may be a mechanical arrangement
      that presses upwards and downwards on opposite sides of the vessel
      in the manner of an aileron, thereby causing the vessel to roll
      sideways and attain a new heading. Where the vessel comprises a
      float and a swimmer connected by a single tether, it is usual to
      put the steering means on the swimmer providing the locomotive
      power. In configurations having two or more tethers, a rudder may
      be placed on the float, the swimmer, or on the float and the
      swimmer together.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Electronics to sense the geographical location of a vessel
      can triangulate off a series of reference points. Particularly
      effective is the global positioning system (GPS), or a similar
      network of positional transmitting sources. The vessel will also
      usually have an electronic compass or gyroscope to determine the
      vessel heading. Positional data about the geographical location
      and the vessel heading is processed in a decision algorithm or
      programmed microprocessor, which may then provide navigation
      instructions. Consequently, the steering means adjusts to head the
      vessel in accordance with the instructions.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 2 shows an example of an algorithm for directing a
      vessel towards or maintaining it at a target position (a
      geographical location). Once the target position is inputted, it
      is compared with the current location of the vessel inputted from
      a GPS receiver. The processor calculates the proper heading, and
      compares it with the heading inputted from the compass. The
      processor then outputs instructions to the rudder servo to adjust
      the vessel onto the correct heading. For vessels that are capable
      of regulating transit speed or locomotive force, the processor may
      also output instructions to adjust the speed (not shown).
      Measurement and correction by comparison with GPS and compass data
      is performed iteratively as the journey continues.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Electrical power is typically needed for the electronics
      used for self-navigation. This can be supplied by photovoltaic
      cells located on the deck of the vessel. For low wind resistance,
      for low visibility, and to reduce the sensitivity to the direction
      of the sun, it is best if this surface is horizontal. For example,
      the top deck can be installed with SunPower(TM) E20 panels each
      containing 96 Maxeon(TM) cells. Under standard conditions
      (irradiance of 1000 Watts/m&lt;2&gt;, AM 1.5, and cell temperature
      of 25[deg.] C.) six panels produce a total of 1962 Watts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Converting Wave Movement to Electrical Power</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] This invention advances the field of wave-powered
      watercraft by providing two sources of locomotive power. One is a
      highly efficient mechanical conversion of wave motion directly to
      locomotive thrust, as described earlier in this disclosure. The
      second is conversion of wave motion to electrical power, which can
      be stored and used at a later time. Having the two systems on
      board provides a number of advantages.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIG. 3 shows the availability of solar power as a function
      of the annual cycle, and as a function of time (adapted from M D
      Ageev, Advanced Robotics 16(1):43-55, 2002). Depending on the size
      and efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, there may be periods
      when solar power is inadequate to power the electronics on board.
      A battery system can be used to buffer and sustain the electronics
      through diurnal variation, but if the vessel spends long periods
      in the far north, for example, solar power may be inadequate. On
      the other hand, using wave motion for locomotive thrust may be
      insufficiently reliable at or near the equator or in summer
      months.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The makers of this invention have discovered that when wave
      motion is high, enough power can be harvested not only to propel
      the vessel through the water, but also to provide ample electrical
      power. In fact, enough electrical power can be harvested from the
      waves not only to power the electronics, but also to create an
      energy supply that can later be used for locomotion. An electrical
      generator can be driven by vertical and/or horizontal movement of
      the vessel caused by the waves. The vessel is configured so that
      the vertical undulations of the vessel are mechanically coupled to
      a means of providing horizontal locomotive power to the vessel
      (such as a fin or wing rack), and are also mechanically coupled to
      a generator of electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In vessels equipped in this way, other sources of
      electrical power (like photovoltaic cells for solar power) are
      entirely optional-the wave motion mechanically provides power to
      drive the vessel through the water, and also provides electricity
      to run electronics and microprocessors aboard.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] When electrical power generated from wave motion and/or
      from solar panels is in excess of immediate needs, it can be
      stored in an on-board rechargeable battery. The stored electrical
      power can be used at a later time to power on-board electronics
      and microprocessors. It can also be used to power an electrically
      driven propulsion system, such as an electric motor coupled to a
      propeller or turbine. Thus, on calm days when there is
      insufficient wave motion to drive the vessel at the desired speed,
      the battery (optionally in combination with photovoltaic cells)
      can power the propulsion system. Conversely, the wave generated
      electrical power can be stored for use during periods that are too
      dark to rely entirely on solar power-for example, at night-and/or
      to supplement locomotive thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 4 is a block diagram summarizing how the interaction
      of power sources can occur. Sources of power are indicated on the
      top line; results at the bottom. Wave motion can provide
      locomotive thrust by mechanical interconnection, such as in a
      two-part vessel where a floating portion is tethered to a
      submarine portion. Wave motion can also power a generator adapted
      for implementation on a vessel, which generates electricity
      delivered to a rechargeable battery. Vessel motion through the
      water (a result of propulsion mechanically generated from the wave
      action) can power an electrical generator of its own, which also
      feeds the battery. Solar panels (if present) also provide
      electrical power to a battery. Although they may be separate,
      typically the battery for any two or three of these power sources
      are shared by the sources that are present.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Electrical power from the battery supplies on-board
      electronics, such as navigation equipment, a microprocessor that
      manages power allocation, and sensors or detectors of various
      kinds. Electrical power can also be tapped at any time it's
      available to provide vessel proportion: either to supplement
      thrust obtained from the wave motion mechanically, or to
      substitute for mechanical thrust at times when wave motion is
      insufficient. As explained below, the electric motor may be the
      same apparatus as the electrical generator powered by vessel
      motion, run in reverse to provide vessel propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 5A, FIG. 5B, FIG. 6A, and FIG. 6B are side views of a
      vessel that illustrates how wave motion can be converted to
      electrical power. The vessel has been equipped to harvest wave
      motion for both locomotive and electrical power. There are two
      tethers 33a and 33b connecting the vessel body 31 to the swimmer
      32, fastened to opposite arms 34a and 34b of a suspension device
      37 by way of rotating hinges 35. The arms of the suspension are
      spring loaded to return to a neutral horizontal configuration in
      opposite directions along an axis parallel to the vessel's length,
      pivoting around a central suspension point 36.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Also shown on the vessel body 31 are a propeller 41 powered
      by an electric motor 42, a rudder 43, and an assembly 44 for
      receiving and transmitting data and operating instructions that is
      mounted on the top deck 45. The configuration can be adapted with
      more tethers attached to more link arms that fold forwards and/or
      backwards, and are mounted on the vessel body 31 beside, in front,
      or behind the suspension device 37 shown here.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 5A superimposes three images showing what happens when
      the vessel body 31 is lifted by a wave. At the starting position,
      the suspension device 37 is configured in the neutral position
      with arms 34a and 34b horizontally positioned in opposite
      directions. As the wave lifts the vessel body 31, it pulls the
      swimmer 32 upwards. However, the density of water slows the upward
      movement of the swimmer 32, thereby pulling the arms 34a and 34b
      of the suspension device 37 downwards. This loads the spring on
      each arm with potential energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 5B superimposes three images showing what happens as
      the vessel approaches the crest of the wave. The upwards motion of
      the vessel body 31 slows, but the swimmer 32 still travels upwards
      due to the tension in the arms when they were being pulled
      downward. As the swimmer 32 continues upwards to a point where the
      arms 34a and 34b resume the neutral horizontal position, the
      potential energy in the suspension device 37 is released, and can
      be captured by a generator means that converts the potential
      energy in the spring into electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 6A superimposes three images of the configuration of
      the suspension device 37 as the potential energy is released. In
      this example, the two tether winches 33a and 33b pivotally mounted
      35 to the ends of link-arms 34a and 34b drive a piston:
      specifically, a linear hydraulic cylinder 38, which in turn
      creates pressure to drive a hydraulic turbine generator (not
      shown). For simplicity the hydraulic cylinder 38 is shown here
      attached to only one of the link arms 34a, although more typically
      there is another hydraulic cylinder attached to the other link arm
      34b. The link arms 34a and 34b could package nicely in the center
      span structure without protruding above the deck 45 of the vessel
      body 31. Optionally, the link arms 44a and 44b can be configured
      to lock in the neutral horizontal position during times where all
      of the wave energy is needed for thrust, or when electric
      generation is not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 6B provides a detail of the action of the hydraulic
      cylinder 38 during a cycle of movement of the link arm 34a from
      the neutral horizontal position to the vertical tending spring
      loaded position as the swimmer is pulled upwards by the vessel
      body 31 as the wave peaks. When the link arms are in the neutral
      position, the hydraulic cylinder is extended 39a, and is pushed
      together 39b into a compressed position 39c as the link arm 34a
      descends towards the vertical. When the link arm 34a returns to
      the horizontal position as the wave troughs, the hydraulic
      cylinder returns to the extended position 39a, completing the
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The arrangement shown in these figures may be adjusted to
      the user's liking to fit a particular installation. The swing arm
      system shown in FIG. 5A, FIG. 5B, FIG. 6A, and FIG. 6B may be
      placed on the swimmer rather than on the float. The link arms are
      pivotally mounted at the proximal end towards the upper surface of
      the swimmer, and are spring loaded to assume a horizontal neutral
      position. The tether is attached to the distal end of the arm, and
      connects to the float above. Wave motion again stretches the
      distance between the float and the tether, but in this case the
      link arms are pulled into an upwards orientation, creating
      potential energy in the spring that can be converted to electrical
      power.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Whether mounted on the float or the swimmer, the electrical
      power generation system may harvest the up and down motion of the
      link arms by a suitable arrangement that ultimately results in a
      mechanical force turning conductive wire or bar within a magnetic
      field, or turning a magnet through a conductor. Included are
      mechanical arrangements that result directly in rotatory motion
      (such as a rotating axle), or a back-and-forth action (such as a
      liquid or gas filled piston) that can be converted mechanically
      into rotatory motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The electrical power generation system shown in FIG. 5A,
      FIG. 5B, FIG. 6A, and FIG. 6B are provided by way of an example of
      how such a system may be implemented with high conversion
      efficiency. The example is not meant to limit practice of the
      claimed invention except where explicitly indicated. Other systems
      for harnessing electricity from wave power on a moving vessel may
      be adapted from stationary on-shore technology now deployed or
      under development.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Electrical power generating systems may be configured to
      harness vertical oscillation of the water surface in a wave cycle,
      or horizontal movement of the wave peaks, or a combination of the
      two. By way of illustration, a system that harvests electrical
      power from vertical movement can comprise a tube that floats
      vertically in the water and tethered to the vessel. The tube's
      up-and-down bobbing motion is used to pressurize water stored in
      the tube below the surface. Once the pressure reaches a certain
      level, the water is released, spinning a turbine and generating
      electricity. In another illustration, an oscillating water column
      drives air in and out of a pressure chamber through a Wells
      turbine. In a third illustration, the power generating system
      comprises a piston pump secured below the water surface with a
      float tethered to the piston. Waves cause the float to rise and
      fall, generating pressurized water, which is then used to drive
      hydraulic generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] To harvest horizontal wave movement, the electrical power
      generating system may comprise one or more large oscillating flaps
      positioned to catch waves as they go by. The flap flexes backwards
      and forwards in response to wave motion, which in turn drives
      pistons that pump seawater at high pressure through a pipe to a
      hydroelectric generator. Another implementation comprises a series
      of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints. As
      waves pass along the length of the apparatus, the sections move
      relative to one another. The wave-induced motion of the sections
      is resisted by hydraulic cylinders, which pump high pressure water
      or oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic
      accumulators. The hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to
      produce electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Converting Horizontal Movement of the Vessel to Electrical
        Power</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0063] Another way of converting wave motion to electrical power
      is a two-step process. The first step is to use the wave motion to
      create locomotive thrust, thereby causing the vessel to move
      through the water. The second step is to harvest the movement of
      the water about the vessel resulting from the locomotion, and
      convert it to electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 7, FIG. 8A, and FIG. 8B show an example of a vessel
      that uses wave motion to generate both locomotive thrust and
      electrical power from vessel motion. In this example, the swimmer
      or wing-rack is tethered to the buoy or vessel body by a forward
      and aft tether with a winch for adjusting the length of tether
      that is deployed. As the buoy moves up and down with the waves,
      the swimmer rack has wings that translate the vertical movement
      into transverse locomotive movement. The wing-rack then pulls the
      vessel body as directed by the rudder under control of the
      microprocessor.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The electrical system shown here comprises upward facing
      solar panels, providing an auxiliary source of electrical power.
      The power module for generating electricity is shown in detail in
      FIG. 8B. The module comprises rechargeable batteries, a rotating
      magnet conductor arrangement that plays the role of both motor and
      generator, and a third component that plays the role of both
      propeller and turbine. As shown in FIG. 7, when there is an
      abundance of wave power, the wings on the swimmer generate thrust
      or locomotive power to move the vessel forward. As the waves power
      the vessel through the water, the propeller is turned backwards,
      applying torque to the motor so as to generate electrical power
      for storage in the battery. When there is an absence of wind
      power, or when the wing rack is retracted into the vessel body,
      the batteries or solar panel powers the motor, which turns the
      propeller so as to provide locomotive power.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The power module is shown in FIG. 8A secured to one side of
      a catamaran type float. This can be varied to secure the power
      module for example to the other side, to the middle of a float
      with a central keel, or to the side rails or middle spine of the
      swimmer. Two or more power modules can be used, secured for
      example to both sides of a catamaran type float, or to a float and
      swimmer together in any combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In the example shown, the hull type is a displacement
      catamaran, which has the advantage of being very efficient below
      the hull speed, and can be powered up to 3 times faster than the
      hull speed with minimal wake. It has six 325 watt SunPower panels
      for almost 2000 watts peak solar power collection. It also has two
      Tesla-sized lithium ion battery packs housed in cylindrical power
      modules that are pressure tolerant to 200 m. These packs each have
      roughly 7000 cells totally 25 kWh of energy. The power modules are
      12.75 inches in diameter-the same as a Remus 600 or a BlueFin 12D
      AUV.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Balancing Between Locomotive Thrust and Electrical Power
        Generation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] In some implementations of the invention, the various power
      harvesting systems on a vessel may be configured to be regulated
      so as to prioritize delivery of power from wave motion to
      locomotive thrust or electricity generation in the desired
      proportion.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The electrical power generating system may be configured to
      lock out or variably dampen movement of the components that
      convert the wave motion to rotatory motion, and hence to
      electricity. For example, the link arm system shown in FIG. 5A,
      FIG. 5B, FIG. 6A, and FIG. 6B may be designed so that the link
      arms may be secured by a clamp or other means in the horizontal
      neutral position. This effectively locks out the power generating
      system in favor of the wave-powered propulsion system, which may
      be desirable when the wave motion is not in excess of what is
      required to propel the vessel at the intended speed, and/or when
      electrical power is not needed (for example, when the battery is
      charged to full capacity). In a variation of this system, the
      damping is variable, so that the proportion of wave motion used
      for electrical power generation may be precisely adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Conversely, the wave-powered propulsion system may be
      configured to lock out or variably dampen movement of the
      components that convert the wave motion to thrust. For example,
      the wings or fins shown in FIG. 1B may be designed so that they
      may be secured in a neutral position. This effectively locks out
      the propulsion system in favor of the electrical power generating
      system, which may be desirable when the wave motion is well in
      excess of what is required to propel the vessel at the intended
      speed, and/or when electrical power is needed in greater abundance
      to power on-board electronics and/or recharge the battery. In a
      variation of this system, the damping is variable, so that the
      proportion of wave motion used for locomotive thrust may be
      precisely adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Besides adjusting use of the wave motion between thrust and
      electricity generation, a variable damping system on the
      propulsion system may have a further benefit: namely, to regulate
      speed of the vessel depending on the amount of wave motion
      currently available, and the desired target location. For example,
      when it is desired that the vessel stay in position at its current
      location, the propulsion regular and rudder may be caused assume a
      direction and speed that exactly compensates for the net effect of
      underlying current, wind, and horizontal wave force affecting the
      vessel's position. This effectively secures the vessel at its
      current GPS location, and saves the vessel from having to travel
      in circles to maintain its position.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Thus, either the propulsion system, or the electrical power
      generating system, or both may be configured with a lock out or
      variable damping arrangement to adjust the priority between the
      two systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Where such regulation systems are installed, they may be
      controlled by an on-board microprocessor programmed to determine
      the appropriate priority between locomotion and electrical power
      generation, and then to regulate the damping or lockout devices on
      each system accordingly. The microprocessor may be programmed to
      take into account such factors as vertical wave motion, latitude
      (determined by GPS), temperature, other weather factors, battery
      level, distance from the intended target location, amount of
      available solar power, time of day, payload, sensor data, and
      operating parameters programmed into or transmitted to the
      microprocessor.<br>

      <b>[0000] Alternating Locomotive Thrust from Wave Motion and an
        Electrical Motor to Buffer Vessel Speed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0074] Stored electrical power in the battery can be used to power
      the electric motor and provide propulsion whenever desired.
      Besides powering the motor during periods when wave motion is
      quiescent, it can be used on an ongoing basis to buffer the trust
      powered by the wave motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 9 is a graph of hypothetical data that illustrates how
      this might work. Mechanisms that convert wave motion into
      locomotive power by gradually pressurizing a gas or a liquid may
      provide fairly uniform thrust. However, other mechanisms result in
      undulations in thrust that occur once or twice per wave cycle. For
      example, in a configuration where a wing rack is tethered beneath
      a float (as in FIG. 1B), the mechanism provides forward thrust
      while the rack is travelling upwards or downwards in the wave
      cycle. When the wave is peaking or at its nadir, tension on the
      tethers is fairly constant, and forward thrust is minimal. Thus,
      in a single wave cycle (as shown in FIG. 9), forward thrust peaks
      twice.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In many uses of a wave-powered vessel, the undulations are
      of little consequence. However, there are instances in which a
      constant speed (and thus relatively constant thrust) is desirable:
      for example, when using sensors that comprise streamers flowing
      backwards from the vessel. The undulations in thrust obtained by
      mechanical conversion can be buffered by powering the electrical
      motor in an undulating pattern of the same frequency but
      essentially out of phase. In this manner, thrust from mechanical
      conversion and thrust from the electric motor alternate, so that
      the combined locomotive thrust is buffered to a more consistent
      level. The pattern of power to the electric motor may be
      controlled by an on board microprocessor programmed to detect the
      wave cycle, predict the undulations in mechanically derived
      locomotive thrust, and synchronize the electric motor out of phase
      to compensate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Watercraft Configured for Self-Deployment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0077] Another advantage of the hybrid powered vehicles of this
      invention is that in many instances they may be deployed directly
      from shore. This saves the trouble and expense of hiring a special
      vessel and crew to do the deployment in deep water. Instead, the
      components of the vessel are kept bound together, and the electric
      motor powers the vessel to deep water for full deployment.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] For example, a wave-powered vessel configured for
      deployment from shore may comprise a buoyant vessel body, a
      swimmer configured to retract and be secured against the vessel
      body, one or more tethers connecting the float to the swimmer, an
      electrically powered motor configured to propel the vessel through
      the water, and a battery supplying power to the motor, having
      sufficient capacity to power the vessel from shore to a location
      where the swimmer can be deployed. The battery is charged up
      before launch, and the swimmer is kept secured to the float. The
      electric motor takes the vessel to deep water, and then the
      tethers are let out to deploy the swimmer to its operative
      position below the float-either automatically, or by remote
      control. After deployment, the battery can be recharged on an
      ongoing basis using the electrical power generating systems aboard
      the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 10 provides a further illustration. Some projects with
      wave powered vessels require the vessels to take a substantially
      massive payload. If kept aboard the float or the swimmer, the
      payload could impair vertical movement, and thus reduce efficiency
      of the vessel for converting wave motion to thrust and electrical
      power. Typically, the payload is towed in a container or platform
      referred to as a "tow buoy" behind the float or the swimmer,
      either on or below the water surface. However, deploying the
      vessel and the tow buoy separately from shore is difficult.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The figure shows how the vessel body and the tow buoy may
      be configured so that the tow buoy may be releasably housed within
      the vessel body while on shore, and pulled behind the vessel body
      after the vessel is deployed. The refinements shown include
      rollers to guide the tow buoy up one or more complementary ramps
      inside the float. To transport the vessel to the launch site, the
      tow buoy is positioned securely inside the float, and the tethers
      connecting the wing racks to the float are retracted so that the
      wing racks nest securely to the bottom of the float. Following
      launch, the precharged battery powers the vessel to deep water,
      whereupon the wing racks are deployed downward, and the tow buoy
      is deployed out the back of the float so as to be towed by the
      float without impairing the float's vertical movement due to wave
      motion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use of Wave-Powered Watercraft</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0081] The hybrid wave-powered vessels of this invention can be
      manufactured, sold, and deployed for any worthwhile purpose
      desired by the user. For example, the vessels can be used to
      survey and monitor regions of the ocean or other bodies of water,
      including the chemistry of water and air, weather, and marine
      life. The vessels can be used to relay signals from sensors under
      the water or on other vessels to a data processing center. They
      can be used to monitor activities on shore, and the behavior of
      other watercraft. They can also be used to distribute substances
      into the ocean from the vessel body or from a tow buoy.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Sensors and related equipment that may be used include one
      or more of the following in any suitable combination:<br>
      <br>
      Sensors for gas concentrations in air or water<br>
      Heat flux sensors<br>
      Meteorological sensors: wind speed &amp; direction, air
      temperature, solar intensity, rain fall, humidity, pressure<br>
      Physical oceanography sensors; wave spectrum &amp; direction,
      current sensors, CTD profiles<br>
      Micro-organism counts and classification through water sampling
      and vision systems<br>
      Fish and wildlife tracking by acoustic tag detection, such as
      those manufactured by Vemco<br>
      FAD structures to provide shade and attract marine life<br>
      Acoustic sensors for active or passive detection and
      classification of marine wildlife. For example, hydrophone for
      listening to whales, or active sonar for fish counts<br>
      Chemical sensors to detect the concentration of a substance being
      released by the vessel<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Equipment installed on a vessel of this invention to
      facilitate data collection may include a means for obtaining
      sensor data at variable depths. This can be achieved using a winch
      system to lower and raise sensors mounted on a heavier-than-water
      platform. Another option is a tow buoy mounted with sensors, with
      servo-controlled elevator fins to alter the pitch of the tow body,
      thereby controlling its depth while being pulled. The vessel may
      also have data storage systems and a microprocessor programmed to
      process and interpret data from the sensors, either integrated
      into the location and navigation processing and control system on
      the vessel, or as a stand-alone microprocessor system.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Watercraft of this invention equipped with sensors and/or
      payloads have a variety of sociological and commercially important
      uses. Such uses include fertilizing plankton, feeding fish,
      sequestering carbon from the atmosphere (PCT/US2012/029718),
      conducting seismic surveys (US 2012/0069702 A1) or prospecting for
      new sources of minerals or fuel oil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Glossary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0094] The terms "vessel", "watercraft", and sea going "vehicle"
      are used interchangeably in this disclosure and previous
      disclosures to refer to a nautical craft that can travel across
      and about any body of water at or near the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A "wave-powered" vessel is a vessel that derives at least a
      majority of its power for locomotion from motion of the water in
      relation to the surface. Optionally, the vessel may also derive
      power from solar energy and other natural sources, and/or man-made
      sources such as batteries and liquid fuel powered engines. In this
      context, a "wave" is any upward and downward motion of the surface
      of a body of water at a point of reference (such as the center of
      floatation of a vessel).<br>
      <br>
      [0096] A "vessel body" or "float" is a component of a vessel that
      travels on or near the surface of the water. It may have its own
      source of locomotive power and/or rely on being pulled by a
      submarine component. It is made buoyant by having a density
      (including enclosed air pockets and upward opening cavities) that
      is<br>
      <br>
      [0097] A "swimmer", "pod", "submarine component", "sub", "glider"
      or "wing rack" is a component of a vessel that travels below the
      surface of the water and below the vessel body, to which it
      provides locomotive power or propulsion. The swimmer is heavier
      than water, so as to travel downwards through the water to the
      extent allowed by the tethers and the vessel body and suspension
      systems to which the tethers are attached above. It is typically
      equipped with a plurality of "fins" or "wings" that rotate upwards
      or downwards around an axle transverse to the direction of travel.
      This disclosure generally refers to vessels having single swimmers
      or wing racks. However, vessels may be configured with multiple
      swimmers, typically joined to the same two or more tethers at
      different depths, each providing locomotive thrust in response to
      wave action, and optionally configured for nesting when retracted
      (PCT/US2012/029696). Thus, all the aspects of this invention
      deriving wave power from a swimmer includes or can be adapted
      mutatis mutandis to include two, three, or more than three
      swimmers or wing racks.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] An "autonomous" vessel is a vessel that is designed and
      configured to travel across a body of water without needing a
      human on board or in constant active control at a remote location.
      It has a self-contained source of locomotive power. Navigation is
      controlled, either by a combination of sensors, electronics, and
      microprocessors aboard or at a remote location and in wireless
      communication with the vessel. The vessel may also be programmed
      to manage the ratio of locomotive power derived mechanically from
      wave action, and from an electric motor. It may also be programmed
      to control dampening of the action of fins on the swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] A "tow buoy" is a storage container or equipment platform
      that is towed behind a vessel, attached either the float or the
      swimmer, and traveling on or below the water surface. The term
      does not necessarily indicate that the container or platform has a
      degree of buoyancy.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] A "microprocessor" or "computer processor" on a vessel or
      control unit of the invention inputs data, processes it, and then
      provides output such as data interpretation or instructions to
      direct the activity of another apparatus or component. For vessels
      or units that have different data sets for processing in different
      ways, the microprocessor for each algorithm may be separate, but
      more commonly they are a single microprocessor configured and
      programmed to process each the different data sets with the
      corresponding algorithms when it is appropriate<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The wave-powered vessels of this invention may be organized
      in fleets of two or more that interact with each other and/or with
      a central control unit. The terms "control unit", "central control
      unit" and "control center" are used interchangeably to refer to an
      electronic assembly or combination of devices that receives
      information about one or more conditions of the water, the
      weather, or other aspects of the environment at one or more
      locations, makes decisions about where it is appropriate to
      distribute fertilizer or another substance from one or more
      distribution vessels, and sends instructions to the vessels in the
      fleet accordingly. The control unit may be placed anywhere on
      shore within range to receive and transmit data and instructions,
      or it may be aboard one of the vessels in the fleet, optionally
      integrated with the microcircuitry of that vessel.<br>
