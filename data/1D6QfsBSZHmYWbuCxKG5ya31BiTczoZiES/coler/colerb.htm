              two devices by which it is alleged electrical energy may
              be derived without a chemical or mechanical source of
              power. Since an official interest was taken in his
              inventions by the German Admiralty it was felt that an
              investigation was warranted, although normally it would be
              considered that such a claim could only be fraudulent.</font></p>

      <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
        <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly Coler
            was visited and interrogated. He proved to be cooperative
            and willing to disclose all details of his devices, and
            consented to build up and put into operation a small model
            of the so-called "Magnetstromapparat" [Magnet Power
            Apparatus] using material supplied to him by us, and working
            only in our presence. With this device, consisting only of
            permanent magnets, copper coils, and condensers in a static
            arrangement he showed that he could obtain a tension of 450
            millivolts for a period of some hours; and in a repetition
            of the experiment the next day 60 millivolts was recorded
            for a short period. The apparatus has been brought back and
            is now being further investigated.</font>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coler also discussed
              another device called the "Stromzeuger", from which he
              claimed that with an input of a few watts from a dry
              battery an output of 6 kilowatts could be obtained
              indefinitely. No example of this apparatus exists today,
              but Coler expressed his willingness to construct it, given
              the materials, the time required being about three weeks.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This device consists of
              six permanent magnets wound in a special way so that the
              circuit includes the magnet itself as well as the winding
              (See Figure 1). These six magnet-coils are arranged in a
              hexagon and connected as shown in the diagram (Figures 2
              &amp; 3), in a circuit which includes two small
              condensers, a switch, and a pair of solenoidal coils, one
              sliding inside the other. To bring the device into
              operation, the switch is left open, the magnets are moved
              slightly apart, and the sliding coil set into various
              positions, with a wait of several minutes between
              adjustments. The magnets are then separated still further,
              and the coils moved again. This process is repeated until
              at a critical separation of the magnets an indication
              appears on the voltmeter. The switch is now closed, and
              the procedure continued more slowly. The tension then
              builds up gradually to a maximum, and should then remain
              indefinitely. The greatest tension obtained was stated to
              be 12 volts.</font></p>

            "Magnetstromapparat" was developed by Coler and von Unruh
            (now dead) early in 1933, and they were later assisted by
            Franz Haid of Siemens-Schukert, who built himself a model
            which worked in December 1933. This was seen by Dr. Kurt Mie
            of Berlin Technische Hochschule and Herr Fehr (Haber’s
            assistant at the K.W.I.) who reported that the device
            apparently worked, and they could detect no fraud. One model
            is said to have worked for 3 months locked in a room in the
            Norwegian Legation in Berlin in 1933. No further work
            appears to have been done on this system since that date.</font></blockquote>

            investigation, but this was refused, as was also a patent,
            on the grounds that it was a "perpetual motion machine".
            This version was also seen by Profs. Schumann (Munich)
            Bragatad (Trondheim) and Knudsen (Copenhagen). Reports by

            70 watts. This was demonstrated to Dr. F. Modersohn, who
            obtained from Schumann and Kloss confirmation of their tests
            in 1926. Modersohn then consented to back the invention, and
            formed a company (Coler g.m.b.h.) to continue the
            development. At the same time a Norwegian group had been
            giving financial support to Coler, and these two groups
            clashed. Modersohn’s connection with Rheinmetall Borsig, and
            hence with the official Hermann Goering combine gave him an
            advantage in this. Coler then in 1937 built for the Company
            a larger version with an output of 6 kilowatts.</font></blockquote>

            Department of the O.K.M. The investigation was placed under
            the direction of the Oberaurat Seysen, who sent Dr. H.
            Frohlich to work with Coler from 1.4.43 to 25.9.43. Frohlich
            was convinced of the reality of the phenomenon, and set
            about investigating the fundamentals of the device. He
            apparently concentrated on a study of the energy changes
            which occur on the opening and closing of the inductive
            circuits. At the end of the period he was transferred to

            Coler had evacuated. Since at that time Coler had been

            questioned about the theory of the devices, but he was
            unable to give any coherent suggestions as to the mechanism.
            He sated that his researches (apparently conducted with
            crude apparatus) into the nature of magnetism had lead him
            to conclude that ferro-magnetism was an oscillating
            phenomenon, of frequency about 180 kilohertz. This
            oscillation took place in the magnetic circuit of the
            apparatus, and induced in the electrical circuit
            oscillations the frequency which of course depended on the
            values of the components used. These two phenomena
            interacted, and gradually built up the tension. As the
            mechanism was not understood the proper arrangement could
            not be worked out, but had to be arrived at by experiment,
            and the apparatus had to be brought into adjustment by
            similar trial and error methods. Coler stated that the
            strength of the magnets did <u>not</u> decrease during the
            use of the apparatus; and suggested that he was tapping a
            new sort of energy hitherto unknown "Raumenergie"
            (Space-energy). Coler gave a resume of the work done by Dr.
            Frohlich for the O.K.W., and produced a copy of Frohlich’s

            Coler claims but had taken great precautions to eliminate
            fraud. He had seen the 70 watt "Stromzeuger" working on a
            number of occasions, and had taken it while working from one
            room to another. All parts were visible and nothing was

            magnets are wound in a clockwise direction looking at the N
            pole (called <u>left</u>) and others in an anti-clockwise
            direction (called <u>right</u>). The magnets were selected
            to be as nearly equal in strength as possible, and the
            resistance of the magnet-coil combination was checked after
            winding to see that this also was uniform (about 0.33 ohm).
            The physical arrangement was as shown in Figure 2, in a
            breadboard style. Measurements of voltage and current across
            A-B were made with a Mavometer. A mechanical arrangement of

            In case there would have been such wave-currents, the

            In reality, however, a somewhat smaller current was found
            was when employing the hotwire instrument. This may be
            explained by the fact that the inner resistance of the
            instrument is about 10 times greater than that of the
            continuous-current instrument, so that when switching on the
            hotwire instrument the load of the apparatus was somewhat
            lessened. The difference between 3.08 ampere measured with
            the continuous-current instrument as compared with 2.95
            ampere measured with the hotwire-instrument is easily

            the magnet-exciting circuit is fed by a special battery,
            completely separated from the other two circuits.
            Consequently, a direct comparison of efficiency and

            transformer coils are connected, the whole being connected
            to one large coil plate (Plattenspule). On each of the
            single windings on this is coupled a large flat coil
            (Flachspule)(called field). These flat coils are interwound
            in two groups; these groups represent the turns of a
            transformer. This couples, on one hand on the flat coils of
            the other group (as secondary coils), and on the other hand
            on the anchor-plate coil, which is placed between them. The
            third electrically independent circuit (called the directing
            circuit)(Steurkreis) regulates this transference. Figure 1

            corresponds to a magnetic field, which is dependent on the
            dimensions of the solenoid. At the moment of connection the
            electrons do not begin to flow at the same time in all parts
            of the coil, because the electromagnetic wave (Storungwelle)
            travels with the velocity of light. The electromagnetic
            field at different parts of the coil also builds up with a
            corresponding time difference. Now in a right hand wound
            coil a north pole is produced at the end where the current
            enters (the current direction is taken now and hereafter to
            be the direction of flow of the electrons, i.e., from
            negative to positive), in a left hand coil a south pole is
            similarly produced. In the first case the building up of the
            magnetic field proceeds from the north pole to the south, in
            the second place from the south to the north, or in other
            words: The direction of the building up of the field is in
            one case with the direction of the flow of the field and in

            measurements, from the year 1937, made by the inventor and
            his assistant, Dipl. Ing. Rudolf Hingst, had shown the
            following effect. Given two solenoids each consisting of two
            coils one upon the other, of the same length and number of
            turns, one winding of one solenoid is connected in series
            with one winding of the other, wound in the same sense, and
            an intermittent direct current is passed through them. The
            remaining windings, which are to be considered as secondary
            coils, are also connected in series but wound in opposite
            sense to one another. The induced secondary currents are
            therefore similarly in opposition, and would, due to the
            equal dimensions of the coils eliminate each other. The
            measurements referred to above are said to have given the
            result that in such a secondary circuit a considerable
            direct current component exists which can be strengthened by
            means of which we shall not go into here. And this
            strengthening is to such a degree that the "secondary direct

          <p><b>Hi all,</b> </p>
          <p><b>After reading all I found about Captain Hans Coler work,
              I decided to replicate his Magnetstromapparat (Magnet
              Power Apparatus) and after I will do the Stromerzeuger.
              Thanks to pese for the most than welcome info on this
              little marvel. Don't know if it will work but if I won't
              know if I don't try.</b> </p>
          <p><b>Here are the first pictures of my replication of the
              magnetstromapparat. The setup is not finish and still a
              few things to do before the tests start.</b> </p>
          <p><b>Enjoy,</b> </p>
