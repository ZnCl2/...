    <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Immediately</b>
        after World War Two, Allied technical teams plundered all the
        scientific data they could find in Germany. Much of what they
        learned remains classified to this day. One most remarkable
        exception to this secrecy is the declassified British
        Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (BIOS) Final Report #1043,
        Item #32: "The Invention of Hans Coler Relating to an Alleged
        New Source of Power". Coler was interviewed by R. Hurst
        (Ministry of Supply) and Capt. R. Sandberg (Norwegian Army):</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"[Naval Captain] Hans Coler
          is the inventor of two devices by which it is alleged that
          electric energy may be derived without a chemical or
          mechanical source of power. Since an official interest was
          taken in his inventions by the German Admiralty it was felt
          that an investigation was warranted, although normally it
          would be considered that such a claim could only be
          fraudulent... Accordingly, Coler was visited and interrogated.
          He proved to be cooperative and willing to discuss all details
          of his devices, and consented to build and put into operation
          a small model of the so-called Magnetstromapparat [Magnet
          Current Apparatus]... With this device, consisting only of
          permanent magnets, copper coils and condensers in a static
          arrangement, he showed that he could obtain a tension of 450
          mv for several hours... One model is said to have worked for
          three months locked in a room in the Norwegian Legation in
          Berlin in 1933... The greatest tension obtained was 12 volts."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coler also invented another
          device called the <i>Stromzeuger</i> (Current Generator). He
          claimed that, "with an input of a few watts from a dry battery
          an output of 6 kW could be obtained indefinitely." The last
          and largest model which Coler built was destroyed by a bomb in
          1945, but "Coler expressed his willingness to construct it,
          given the materials, the time required being about 3 weeks."
          The public version of the BIOS report does not state whether
          or not this was done. However, Bill Lehr (d. 1996) informed
          this writer that a close friend of his once saw a Stromzeuger
          in operation in the offices of MI5 in London, and a copy of
          the original BIOS report which was over 200 pages in length.
          The declassified report is a mere 30 pages long. Hurst and
          Sandberg also interviewed Dr. F. Modersohn, who had been
          collaborated with Coler and financed his research for 10
          years; he corroborated every detail of Coler's story. The
          Magnetstromapparat was developed by Coler and von Unruh (who
          had died by 1945), and they were assisted by Franz Haid of
          Siemens-Schukert. Haid also built a working model which was
          seen in operation by Dr. Kurt Mie (Berlin Technische
          Hochschule) and Herr Fehr, who was the assistant of the
          renowned scientist Fritz Haber. The Magnetstromapparat was
          described thus:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This device consists of 6
          permanent magnets wound in a special way so that the circuit
          includes the magnet itself as well as the winding (Fig. 1).
          These 6 magnet-coils are arranged in a hexagon and connected
          as shown in the diagram (Figs. 2 &amp; 3), in a circuit which
          includes two small condensers, a switch, and a pair of
          solenoid coils, one sliding inside the other. To bring the
          device into operation the switch is left open, the magnets are
          moved slightly apart, and the sliding coil set into various
          positions, with a wait of several minutes between adjustments.
          The magnets are then separated still further, and the coils
          moved again. This process is repeated until at a critical
          separation an indication appears on the voltmeter. The switch
          is now closed, and the procedure continued more slowly. The
          tension then builds up gradually to a maximum, and should then
          remain indefinitely. The greatest tension obtained was stated
          to be 12 volts...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In our presence, Coler
          built an apparatus as shown in Figures 1-3. It is to be noted
          that some of the magnets are wound in a clockwise direction
          looking at the N pole (called <u>left</u>) and others in an
          anti-clockwise direction (called <u>right</u>). The magnets
          were selected to be as nearly equal in strength as possible,
          and the resistance of the magnet-coil combination was checked
          after winding to see that this also was uniform (about 0.33
          ohm). The physical arrangement was as shown in Fig. 2. A
          mechanical arrangement of sliders and cranks for separating
          the magnets evenly all around was made up.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When the magnets were at a
          separation of about 7 mm, the first small deflection was
          noted. The switch was closed and by slow adjustment of the
          sliding coil, and by increasing the separation of the magnets
          to just over 8 mm, the tension was raised to 250 millivolts.
          This was maintained for another 3 hours when a soldered tag
          became disconnected, and the meter slowly dropped back to
          zero. Soldering up the broken connection did <u>not </u>restore






          the tension. The magnets were closed up and left overnight,
          and the same procedure for adjustment was repeated on 2-7-46.
          After about 3 hours a deflection of 60 millivolts was
          obtained; this was maintained for more than 30 minutes, but
          then decreased to zero when further adjustments were tried.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"During all this work the
          model was completely open, and nothing could be hidden in it.
          The breadboard and meter could be picked up and moved round
          the room, tilted, or turned, without effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The apparatus would appear
          to be to crude to act as a receiver of broadcast energy, or to
          operate by induction from the mains (the nearest cable was 6
          feet away), and the result must for the moment be regarded as
          inexplicable"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"[Coler was of the opinion
          that] ferro-magnetism was an oscillating phenomenon, of
          frequency about 180 kilohertz. This oscillation took place in
          the magnetic circuit of the apparatus, and induced in the
          electrical circuit the frequency which of course depended on
          the value of the components used. These two phenomena
          interacted, and gradually built up the tension... Coler stated
          that the strength of the magnets did <u>not</u> decrease
          during the use of the apparatus, and suggested that he was
          tapping a new sort of energy hitherto unknown "Raumenergie"
          (Space-energy).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It was judged that Coler
          was an honest experimenter and not a fraud... The result
          obtained was genuine insofar as could be tested with the
          facilities available, but no attempt has yet been made to find
          an explanation of the phenomenon."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Stromzeuger was invented
          in 1925, at which time Coler showed a 10-watt model to Prof.
          Kloss in Berlin. Kloss tried to interest the German government
          in the invention, but his request was refused (as was Coler's
          patent application) because it was a "perpetual motion
          machine". The model was also seen by Prof. Schumann (of
          terrestial resonance fame), Pr. Bragstad (Trondheim), and Pr.
          Knudsen (Copenhagen). Kloss and Schumann wrote reports
          explaining the physics of its operation, which apparently
          amplified the Barkhausen Effect to a useful level. The
          Stromzeuger was described in the BIOS report as follows: This
          device consists of an arrangement of magnets, flat coils, and
          copper plates, with a primary circuit energized by a small dry
          battery. The output from the secondary was used to light a
          bank of lamps and was claimed to be many times the original
          input, and to continue indefinitely." Coler and von Unruh
          constructed a 70 watt model of the Stromzeuger in 1933 and
          demonstrated it to Dr. F. Modersohn, who subsequently financed
          the development of the invention and established the Coler
          Gmbh. for the purpose. In 1937, Coler built a 6 KW version of
          the Stromzeuger. In 1942, Modersohn demonstrated the device to
          the Research Dept. of the German Navy, which intervened and
          supplied them with materials, meters and tools. Thereafter the
          research was directed by Oberbaurat (Naval Construction Chief)
          Seysen, who assigned Dr. H. Frolich to assist Coler for
          several months. The operation of the newly developed apparatus
          turned out to be more complicated than they had first thought,
          but progress was made. The large Stromzeuger was destroyed by
          a bomb which struck Coler's house in Kolberg (Pomerania) in
          1945. Coler had been powering his house with the unit for
          three years. Hurst and Sandberg gave a summary account of the
          Stromzeuger in their report:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The basic principle is that
          an electron is to be regarded not only as a negatively charged
          particle but also as a South magnetic pole.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The basic element is that
          of an open secondary circuit, capacity loaded, inductively
          coupled to a primary circuit. The novel feature is that the
          capacities are connected to the secondary core <u>through
            permanent magnets</u>, as shown in Figure 4.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is claimed that, on
          switching on the primary circuit, "separation of charges"
          takes place, i.e., Magnet 1 becomes positively charged and
          Magnet 2 becomes negatively charged, and that these charges
          are "magnetically polarized" when they are formed, owing to
          the presence of the magnets. On switching off the primary
          circuit a "reversing current" flows in the secondary, but the
          magnets "do not exert a polarizing effect on this reversal".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Two of these basic elements
          are now placed together making a double system or stage with
          the plates close together in parallel planes as shown in
          Figure 5. The secondary windings are both exactly equal and
          wound in a direction such that on switching on the primary
          coil the electrons in the secondary coil flow from P<sub>1 </sub>to







          P<sub>2</sub> [P = Plate] and F<sub>1</sub> to F<sub>2 </sub>[F







          = "Flat Spool"].</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is then stated that
          system merely has an inducing effect, and the useful current
          comes into existence in the system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A single stage cannot be
          effective but two stages connected so that the numbers of
          effective North and South poles are equal will provide a basic
          working arrangement. More double stages can then be added to
          provide higher outputs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is then stated that as
          well as the normal electrons flowing from the battery and from
          induction when the circuit is opened or closed, "space
          electron" flow from "repelling spaces" to "attracting spaces"
          between the plates" Professors M. Kloss and R. Franke
          (Technical College of Berlin) tested the Stromzeuger in March
          1926; their report was included in BIOS Report 1043:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The apparatus consists of:
          a double row system of copper plates, a double-row system of
          flat spools, and a system of electromagnets, to whose cores
          silver wires are attached and through which branch currents of
          the plate-system are conducted. For each of the three systems
          a 3-part accumulator battery of 6 volts/6.5 ampere-hours
          capacity is provided. The plate-circuit and the spool circuit
          are parallel so that the two batteries appertaining thereto
          can also be replaced by a single battery. This was ascertained
          by switching off the one battery while the apparatus was
          working.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When asked why two
          batteries were used at all, Capt. Coler declared that for
          starting the apparatus a double battery is necessary to get a
          second charge-impetus after exciting with the one battery, and
          this for releasing the peculiar character of the apparatus. A
          test confirmed this assertion in as much as the mechanism
          could not be started with the single battery; on the contrary,
          the "adjustment" of the mechanism got disturbed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Current-indicators are
          built into each of the three circuits mentioned, as well as
          volt-meters, behind some switch resistances necessary for the
          "adjustment". Between the open ends of the two plate and
          spool-systems there are the terminal clamps for the effective
          circuit for whose loading 3 bulbs of 8 volts are provided. The
          apparatus was then put into action and above all the load was
          tested with the aid of the built-in instruments, that is on
          being loaded with [2-3] lamps…</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The consumption of energy
          in the external circuit is greater than the energy taken from
          the batteries. According to the circuit, the magnet-exciting
          circuit is fed by a special battery, completely separated from
          the other two circuits. Consequently, a direct comparison of
          efficiency and consumption of the apparatus would mean that
          only the sum of current of the plate circuit and of the spool
          circuit would count.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The reception of current
          from the two batteries in this case was 1.7 watt while the
          consumption of the bulbs amounted to about 8 watt. Especially
          striking in this connection is the considerably higher
          current-power in the bulb-circuit being about 12 times bigger
          than the current coming from the two batteries."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Professor W.O. Schumann
          (Munich) also tested the Stromzeuger in 1926; his 6-page
          analysis was included in an appendix of the BIOS Report:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The apparatus in question
          principally consists of two parallel connected spools, which
          being bifilarly wound in a special way, are magnetically
          linked together. One of these spools is composed of copper
          sheets (the spool is called the plate spool), the other one of
          a number of thin parallel connected isolated wires (called:
          spool winding), running parallel at small intervals to the
          plates. Both spools can be fed by separate batteries; at least
          two batteries are necessary to put the spools to work.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The spools are arranged in
          two halves each, according to the bifilar winding system. The
          batteries are attached to the starting points, and the
          current-receivers to the parallel connected ends.
          Inter-communications are connected between parallel windings
          of the two halves of the plate spool which contain iron rods
          with silver connections. These rods are magnetized by a
          special battery through applied windings (called: exciter
          windings).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;"According to the
          statement of the inventor, the production of energy
          principally takes place in these iron rods, and the winding of
          the spools plays an important part in it (The form of the
          spool is a long small rectangle).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The inventor stated that
          the apparatus in its installation was very sensitive,
          especially with regard to the magnetic conditions of the iron
          cores, and that a wrong treatment [internal measurements]
          would cause interferences which would be wearisome and very
          difficult to be eliminated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The exciter winding is
          electrically completely separated from the other windings...</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Installed in the apparatus
          were 3 current meters for the currents from the 3 batteries,
          and furthermore current and volt meters for the current
          receivers. One and two bulbs respectively were employed for
          this purpose.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As a striking fact it
          should be mentioned that the spool circuit having been at
          first always switched on alone, received a current of 104 mA.
          As soon as plates and exciter circuit additionally and
          simultaneously were turned on, as, according to the inventor,
          the apparatus demands it, the current in the spool circuit
          comes down to about 27 mA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After the present
          examination, carried through as carefully as [possible], I
          must surmise that we have to face the exploitation of a new
          source of energy whose further developments can be of an
          immense importance. I believe that a further development of
          the apparatus will prove justified and of great importance."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1943, Hans Coler and Dr.
          Heinz Frohlich made a report to the Research Department of the
          Admiralty (OKM) in Berlin, in which they described the
          Stromzeuger:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The apparatus consists of
          three principle circuits which are inter-wound and
          inter-coupled in a peculiar way. Some of these are divided
          again into single subsidiary circuits which evidently have all
          to be brought into resonance with one another.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The principal circuits
          (called the anchor) in which the energy gain probably occurs,
          consists of metal plates between which transformer coils are
          connected, the whole being connected to one large coil plate.
          On each of the single windings on this is coupled a large flat
          coil (called field). These flat coils are interwound in two
          groups; these groups represent the turns of a transformer.
          This couples, on one hand on the flat coils of the other group
          (as secondary coils), and on the other hand on the
          anchor-plate coil, which is placed between them. The third
          electrically independent circuit (called the directing
          circuit) regulates this transference. Figure 1 [not included
          in the BIOS Report] shows diagramatically and in plan these
          interwound parts. Figure 2, the so-called basic diagram, shows
          the connections between these different parts. This basic
          diagram shows the conditions necessary for self-interruption.
          In consequence of this arrangement, different types of
          currents are created in different conductors (pulsed DC, AC,
          etc.).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The transformer coils,
          connected between the anchor plates, are connected in a
          peculiar way through thin permanent magnet rods. Their main
          object seems to be to pre-magnetize the transformer cores; it
          is, however, very probable that they are also connected with
          the Barkhausen Effect."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In his report Coler also
          described the following simple, significant experiment:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Given a solenoid consisting
          of two windings, one upon the other, of the same length and
          number of turns, enclosing a soft iron cylindrical core.
          Firmly attached to one end of the core is a pre-magnetized
          steel rod. If an alternating current is passed through one of
          these coils, acting as primary, the residual magnetism of the
          steel rod is strengthened during one half cycle, through the
          magnetism induced in the core, during the other half it is
          weakened. If now the other winding is connected in series with
          the pre-magnetized steel rod (as secondary coil) in such a way
          that the secondary current must pass through the magnet, one
          half cycle of the secondary current must be more or less
          subdued; in other words, a rectifying effect must be created.
          It may be remembered that according to measurement by Profs.
          Kloss and Schumann a high-frequency pulsed direct current ~
          about 180 kc ~ is flowing in the output resistance of the
          apparatus, for the creation of which no other explanation is
          possible." Another experiment with two double-wound solenoids,
          connected in series, revealed that "in such a secondary
          circuit a considerable DC component exists which can be
          strengthened by means which we shall not go into here…"
          Experiments were conducted with the plate and flat coil unit
          to test their interactions: As the plates are not only charged
          as condensers, but also have directed currents passing through
          them it had to be assumed that their mutual influences not
          only consisted of a condenser effect, but that they also
          created a magnetic field… It appeared that the "Ankertrakte"
          AC or BD are not all to be considered as oscillating units,
          but that the single group systems, consisting of plate - to
          anchor coils - plate, already represent independent
          oscillation circuits. <u>According to this the apparatus
            contained ten such oscillation circuits</u>… In order to
          make the apparatus work the harmony of all oscillating
          circuits in their individual frequencies would evidently be
          necessary -- at least within certain limits determined by the
          suppression in question… The previous occasional success must
          be considered as due to chance. The mutual influence of the
          flat coils upon one another could not the other hand easily be
          examined because, despite the great distance between the
          windings (25 mm), they have remarkably great apparent
          resistance (about 200 ohms at 10 kc). It appeared that the
          power factor of both of the flat coils wound 1:1, in
          consequence of their peculiar interwinding have the
          astonishingly high value of 0.85. The value of the power
          factor was at a maximum at 10 kc, at which frequency the most
          favorable matching of the impedance… was obtained. The
          repeated mention of 10 kc is also found in the scientific
          literature on the Barkhausen Effect. After all his experiments
          and measurements, Coler offered the following explanation of
          the way in which the apparatus works:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Due to the connecting of
          the batteries, a current impulse is induced in the anchor
          circuit which charges the plates. The discharge circuit from
          the plates causes electrical interruption of short duration of
          the battery current in the field circuit, which furthermore
          inductively interrupts, or changes the direction of, the
          battery current in the directing current for a short time. The
          electromagnetic field induced by this process in the directing
          circuit by its dissipation, induces over the field circuit a
          current in the anchor circuit recharging the plates, and so
          forth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Due to the influence of the
          Barkhausen Effect each single process has an impulse-like
          character, and the necessary change of phase is produced to
          allow the regularity of the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Due to a source, up to the
          present not investigated, and not explainable by existing
          scientific theories, an additional quantity of energy is freed
          during each cycle which leads to a continual raising of the
          amplitude of the mutual processes, until the magnetic cores
          are saturated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"From the fact that in the
          resistance of the apparatus pulsed direct current is flowing…
          There is possibly an up to now unknown rectifying effect, or
          alternatively the gain in energy is produced only during one
          half of the cycle, either during the charging or discharging
          of the plates. The activity in the apparatus must take place <u>in







            the ten oscillation circuits in a phase-like manner</u>… No
          technical means were available to make the necessary tuning
          adjustments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is clear from the above
          that the success of the inventor up to now could only be due
          to chance, or happy accident. The necessity, therefore, arises
          to transfer the apparatus from the state of empirical
          development, with sufficient technical means and based on
          results of an exact basic research, to a state of working
          procedure which can be controlled." Other experiments,
          conducted by Frohlich with the arrangement in Figure 6,
          convinced Coler that his theory was correct:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The result obtained with
          this experimental arrangement… was the clear proof of a
          considerably larger energy during opening (intake), compared
          with closing impulses. The [10-50%] difference is always in
          favor of the opening impulse… Consequently this observation
          can also be considered as a proof of the fact that an energy
          difference exists. [There is a] considerable, but extremely
          short, energy peak of the opening impulse. My development of
          the "Space Energy Receiver" was based on this and was
          successful."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the 1980s, George
          Hathaway (Planetary Association for Clean Energy, PACE)
          constructed a Magnetstromapparat that produced 50 millivolts,
          and demonstrated it at unconventional technology conferences.
          There has been no news of further development. The Barkhausen
          Effect upon which the Coler inventions work is a low-field
          phenomenon that occurs when a ferromagnetic material is
          subjected to a change in the applied magnetic field. A series
          of discontinuous steps develop, corresponding to reversals in
          magnetization domain volumes from 10<sup>-10</sup> to 10<sup>-8</sup>
          cm<sup>3</sup>. The size of the discontinuities can be
          increased by stressing the magnet. Possibly the soft iron
          magnets which Coler used were subjected to such stress by
          ultrasonic magnetostriction from the coil windings at the 180
          kHz resonant frequency. One can only wonder why British
          Intelligence (sic) declassified the Coler report, but we can
          be glad they did. If only they had seen fit to include more
          schematics of the Stromzeuger, because the available diagrams
          are woefully inadequate. At least we now know a few key facts,
          to wit: (1) Ferromagnetism resonates at 180 Khz; (2) The
          Barkhausen Effect can be amplified to provide useful power (10
          Khz is another key frequency here); (3) "Some of the magnets
          are wound in a clockwise direction looking at the N pole
          (called <u>left</u>) and others in an anti-clockwise
          direction (called <u>right</u>)". The resistance of the
          magnet-coil combination was about 0.33 ohm; (4) "The basic
          principle is that an electron is to be regarded not only as a
          negatively charged particle but also as a South magnetic
          pole"; (5) "The novel feature is that the capacities are
          connected to the secondary core <u>through permanent magnets</u>";






          (6) "There is a considerable, but extremely short, energy peak
          of the opening impulse". It is to be hoped that the
          Stromzeuger can be redeveloped, since it is a relatively
          simple, low technology device requiring no exotic components.
          It should not be left "to chance, or a happy accident", as it
          was for Hans Coler.&nbsp;</font> </p>
