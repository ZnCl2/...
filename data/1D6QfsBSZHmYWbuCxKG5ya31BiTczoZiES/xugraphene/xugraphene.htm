      The energy of ionic thermal motion presents universally, which is
      as high as 4 kJ\bullet kg-1\bullet K-1 in aqueous solution, where
      thermal velocity of ions is in the order of hundreds of meters per
      second at room temperature1,2. Moreover, the thermal velocity of
      ions can be maintained by the external environment, which means it
      is unlimited. However, little study has been reported on
      converting the ionic thermal energy into electricity. Here we
      present a graphene device with asymmetric electrodes configuration
      to capture such ionic thermal energy and convert it into
      electricity. An output voltage around 0.35 V was generated when
      the device was dipped into saturated CuCl2 solution, in which this
      value lasted over twenty days. A positive correlation between the
      open-circuit voltage and the temperature, as well as the cation
      concentration, was observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that
      this finding is of practical value by lighting a commercial
      light-emitting diode up with six of such graphene devices
      connected in series. This finding provides a new way to understand
      the behavior of graphene at molecular scale and represents a huge
      breakthrough for the research of self-powered technology.
      Moreover, the finding will benefit quite a few applications, such
      as artificial organs, clean renewable energy and portable
      electronics.<br>

      Researchers at Hong Kong Polytechnic University claim to have
      invented a new kind of graphene-based "battery" that runs solely
      on ambient heat. The device is said to capture the thermal energy
      of ions in a solution and convert it into electricity. The results
      are in the process of being peer reviewed, but if confirmed, such
      a device might find use in a range of applications, including
      powering artificial organs from body heat, generating renewable
      energy and powering electronics.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Diagram showing the experimental set-up of the battery</i><i>.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      <b>Another triumph for graphene?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ions in aqueous solution move at speeds of hundreds of metres per
      second at room temperature and pressure. The thermal energy of
      these ions can thus reach several kilojoules per kilogram per
      degree. However, until now, little work had been done on finding
      out how to tap into this energy and produce power from it.<br>
      <br>
      Zihan Xu and colleagues made their battery by attaching silver and
      gold electrodes to a strip of graphene – which is a film of carbon
      just one atom thick. In their experiments, the researchers showed
      that six of these devices in series placed in a solution of
      copper-chloride ions could produce a voltage of more than 2 V.
      This is enough to drive a commercial red light-emitting diode.<br>
      <br>
      The technology is quite different to conventional lithium-ion
      batteries, for example, which convert chemical energy into
      electricity. "The output of our device is also continuous and it
      works solely by harvesting the thermal energy of the surrounding
      copper-chloride ions, which, in theory, is limitless," says Xu.<br>
      <br>
      According to the researchers, the battery works rather like a
      solar cell. The copper ions (Cu2+) continually collide with the
      graphene strip in the battery. This collision is energetic enough
      to displace an electron from the graphene. This electron can then
      either combine with the copper ion or travel through the graphene
      strip and into the circuit.<br>
      <br>
      Since electrons move through graphene at extremely high speeds
      (thanks to the fact that they behave like relativistic particles
      with no rest mass), they travel much faster in the carbon-based
      material than in the ionic solution. The released electron
      therefore naturally prefers to travel through the graphene circuit
      rather than through the solution. This is how the voltage is
      produced by the device, explains Xu.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Boosting voltage output</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The researchers also found that the voltage produced by the device
      could be increased by heating the ionic solution and accelerating
      the Cu2+ ions with ultrasound. Both of these methods work because
      they increase the kinetic energy of the ions. The voltage also
      increases if the copper-chloride solution is more concentrated
      with Cu2+ ions, because the density of Cu2+ on the graphene is
      then greater. Other cationic solutions can be employed too, such
      as Na+, K+, Co2+ and Ni2+, although these produce lower voltage
      outputs.<br>
      <br>
      The unique atomic-layer nature of graphene is crucial for this
      battery, say the researchers, who also experimented with graphite
      and carbon-nanotube thin films. They discovered that these
      materials only produced low voltages of around microvolts, which
      could be regarded as noise.<br>
      <br>
      Bor Jang of Nanotek Instruments in Dayton, Ohio, who has worked on
      making supercapacitors from graphene, says that the concept
      described looks "very interesting" but that "more work will be
      needed to assess whether the approach could provide sufficient
      energy or power density for practical uses".<br>
      <br>
      For its part, the Hong Kong team now plans to improve the power
      output of its graphene-based device and further investigate how it
      works.<br>

        </big></div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Physicists have built a graphene battery that harvests energy
      from the thermal movement of ions in solution.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s an interesting idea for a battery. The thermal velocity of
      ions in aqueous solution is huge–hundreds of metres per second at
      room<br>
      temperature. And yet few people have studied this process or its
      potential to generate current.<br>
      <br>
      Step forward Zihan Xu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and
      a few buddies who have not only studied this process but seemingly
      mastered it<br>
      too.<br>
      <br>
      These guys have created a circuit consisting of an LED connected
      to a strip of graphene by some wire. They simply placed the
      graphene in a solution of copper chloride and watched. Sure
      enough, the LED lights up. (Actually, they needed six of these
      graphene circuits in series to generate the 2V needed to make the
      LED light up but you get the picture.)<br>
      <br>
      Here’s what’s going on, according to Zihan and co. The copper
      ions, which have a double positive charge, move through the
      solution at a rate of about 300 metres per second thanks to the
      thermal energy of the solution at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      When an ion smashes into the graphene strip, the collision
      generates enough energy to kick a delocalised electron out of the
      graphene. <br>
      <br>
      The electron then has two options: it can either leave the
      graphene strip and combine with the copper ion or it can travel
      through the graphene strip and into the circuit.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that the mobility of electrons is much higher in
      graphene than it is through the solution, so the electron
      naturally chooses the route through the circuit. It is this that
      lights up the LED. <br>
      <br>
      “The released electrons prefer to travel across the graphene
      surface…instead of going into the&nbsp; electrolyte solution. That
      is how the voltage was produced by our device,” say Zihan and co.
      <br>
      <br>
      So the energy generated by this device comes from ambient heat.
      These guys say there were able to increase the current by heating
      the solution and also by accelerating the copper ions with
      ultrasound. They even claim to have kept their graphene battery
      running for 20 days on nothing but ambient heat.<br>
      <br>
      But there’s an important question mark. One alternative hypothesis
      is that some kind of chemical reaction is generating the current,
      just as in an ordinary battery. <br>
      <br>
      However, Zihan and co say they ruled this out with a couple of
      control experiments. However, these are described in some
      supplementary material that they do not appear to have put on the
      arXiv. They’ll need to make this available before others will take
      the claim seriously, of course.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Taken at face value, however, this looks to be a hugely important
      result. Others have generated current in graphene simply by
      passing moving water over it, so it’s not really a surprise that
      moving ions can do the job as well. <br>
      <br>
      It raises the prospect of clean, green batteries powered by
      nothing but ambient heat. As&nbsp; Zihan and co modestly put it:
      “it represents a&nbsp; huge breakthrough for the research of
      self-powered technology”.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s hope they’re right. But for the moment at least, the jury
      must remain undecided.<br>
