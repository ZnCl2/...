          <br>
          Shogaol, also known as (6)-shogaol, is a pungent constituent
          of ginger similar in chemical structure to gingerol. Like
          zingerone, it is produced when ginger is dried or cooked.[1]<br>
          <br>
          Shogaols are artifacts formed during storage or through excess
          heat, probably created by a dehydration reaction of the
          gingerols. The ratio of shogaols to gingerols sometimes is
          taken as an indication of product quality.[2]<br>
          <br>
          The name 'shogaol' is derived from the Japanese name for
          ginger (生姜、shōga).<br>
          <br>
          Shogaol is rated 160,000 SHU on Scoville scale. When compared
          to other pungent compounds, shogaol is moderately more pungent
          than piperine, but less than capsaicin.<br>

          <b>Pharmacology</b><br>
          <br>
          Among ginger constituents, it has a very strong antitussive
          (anti-cough) effect.[medical citation needed]&nbsp; Both
          shogaol and gingerols reduced blood pressure and gastric
          contraction.[4]&nbsp; Shogaol has been shown to induce
          apoptosis (kill) in human colorectal carcinoma cells via
          reactive oxygen species.[5]&nbsp; It is broken down into 16
          metabolites via the mercapturic acid pathway.[4]&nbsp;
          Acetylcysteine was found to reduce effectiveness of shogaol's
          apoptotic properties.[5]<br>

            inhibits breast cancer cell invasion...</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><b>KEY RESULTS</b><br>
          <br>
          Shogaols (6-, 8- and 10-shogaol) inhibited PMA-stimulated
          MDA-MB-231 cell invasion with an accompanying decrease in
          MMP-9 secretion. 6-Shogaol was identified to display the
          greatest anti-invasive effect in association with a
          dose-dependent reduction in MMP-9 gene activation, protein
          expression and secretion. The NF-κB transcriptional activity
          was decreased by 6-shogaol; an effect mediated by inhibition
          of IκB phosphorylation and degradation that subsequently led
          to suppression of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear
          translocation. In addition, 6-shogaol was found to inhibit JNK
          activation with no resulting reduction in activator protein-1
          transcriptional activity. By using specific inhibitors, it was
          demonstrated that ERK and NF-κB signalling, but not JNK and
          p38 signalling, were involved in PMA-stimulated MMP-9
          activation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</b><br>
          <br>
          6-Shogaol is a potent inhibitor of MDA-MB-231 cell invasion,
          and the molecular mechanism involves at least in part the
          down-regulation of MMP-9 transcription by targeting the NF-κB
          activation cascade. This class of naturally occurring small
          molecules thus have potential for clinical use as
          antimetastatic treatments.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberacae) is a
          medicinal plant that has been widely used in Chinese,
          Ayurvedic and Tibb-Unani herbal medicines all over the world,
          since antiquity, for a wide array of unrelated ailments that
          include arthritis, rheumatism, sprains, muscular aches, pains,
          sore throats, cramps, constipation, indigestion, vomiting,
          hypertension, dementia, fever, infectious diseases and
          helminthiasis. Currently, there is a renewed interest in
          ginger, and several scientific investigations aimed at
          isolation and identification of active constituents of ginger,
          scientific verification of its pharmacological actions and of
          its constituents, and verification of the basis of the use of
          ginger in some of several diseases and conditions. This
          article aims at reviewing the most salient recent reports on
          these investigations. The main pharmacological actions of
          ginger and compounds isolated therefrom include
          immuno-modulatory, anti-tumorigenic, anti-inflammatory,
          anti-apoptotic, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-lipidemic and
          anti-emetic actions. Ginger is a strong anti-oxidant substance
          and may either mitigate or prevent generation of free
          radicals. It is considered a safe herbal medicine with only
          few and insignificant adverse/side effects. More studies are
          required in animals and humans on the kinetics of ginger and
          its constituents and on the effects of their consumption over
          a long period of time.<br>

          <br>
          Ginger has been used throughout the world as spice, food and
          traditional herb. We found that 6-gingerol, a phenolic
          alkanone isolated from ginger, enhanced the TRAIL-induced
          viability reduction of gastric cancer cells while 6-gingerol
          alone affected viability only slightly. 6-Gingerol facilitated
          TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing TRAIL-induced
          caspase-3/7 activation. 6-Gingerol was shown to down-regulate
          the expression of cIAP1, which suppresses caspase-3/7
          activity, by inhibiting TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation. As
          6-shogaol has a chemical structure similar to 6-gingerol, we
          also assessed the effect of 6-shogaol on the viability of
          gastric cancer cells. Unlike 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol alone
          reduced the viability of gastric cancer cells. 6-Shogaol was
          shown to damage microtubules and induce mitotic arrest. These
          findings indicate for the first time that in gastric cancer
          cells, 6-gingerol enhances TRAIL-induced viability reduction
          by inhibiting TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation while
          6-shogaol alone reduces viability by damaging microtubules.<br>

          This study has two novel findings: it is not only the first to
          demonstrate that tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADCs)
          facilitate lung and breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in
          vivo by secreting inflammatory mediator CC-chemokine ligand 2
          (CCL2), but it is also the first to reveal that 6-shogaol can
          decrease cancer development and progression by inhibiting the
          production of TADC-derived CCL2. Human lung cancer A549 and
          breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells increase TADCs to express high
          levels of CCL2, which increase cancer stem cell features,
          migration, and invasion, as well as immunosuppressive
          tumor-associated macrophage infiltration. 6-Shogaol decreases
          cancer-induced up-regulation of CCL2 in TADCs, preventing the
          enhancing effects of TADCs on tumorigenesis and metastatic
          properties in A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. A549 and MDA-MB-231
          cells enhance CCL2 expression by increasing the
          phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
          transcription 3 (STAT3), and the activation of STAT3 induced
          by A549 and MDA-MB-231 is completely inhibited by 6-shogaol.
          6-Shogaol also decreases the metastasis of lung and breast
          cancers in mice. 6-Shogaol exerts significant anticancer
          effects on lung and breast cells in vitro and in vivo by
          targeting the CCL2 secreted by TADCs. Thus, 6-shogaol may have
          the potential of being an efficacious immunotherapeutic agent
          for cancers.<br>

          <br>
          Ginger has received extensive attention because of its
          antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities.
          However, the metabolic fate of its major components is still
          unclear. In the present study, the metabolism of [6]-shogaol,
          one of the major active components in ginger, was examined for
          the first time in mice and in cancer cells. Thirteen
          metabolites were detected and identified, seven of which were
          purified from fecal samples collected from [6]-shogaol-treated
          mice. Their structures were elucidated as
          1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-4-decen-3-ol (M6),
          5-methoxy-1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M7),
          3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl-decan-3-one (M8),
          1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M9),
          5-methylthio-1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one
          (M10), 1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M11), and
          5-methylthio-1-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M12)
          on the basis of detailed analysis of their 1H, 13C, and
          two-dimensional NMR data. The rest of the metabolites were
          identified as 5-cysteinyl-M6 (M1), 5-cysteinyl-[6]-shogaol
          (M2), 5-cysteinylglycinyl-M6 (M3), 5-N-acetylcysteinyl-M6
          (M4), 5-N-acetylcysteinyl-[6]-shogaol (M5), and
          5-glutathiol-[6]-shogaol (M13) by analysis of the MSn (n =
          1–3) spectra and comparison to authentic standards. Among the
          metabolites, M1 through M5, M10, M12, and M13 were identified
          as the thiol conjugates of [6]-shogaol and its metabolite M6.
          M9 and M11 were identified as the major metabolites in four
          different cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, H-1299, and
          CL-13), and M13 was detected as a major metabolite in HCT-116
          human colon cancer cells. We further showed that M9 and M11
          are bioactive compounds that can inhibit cancer cell growth
          and induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. Our results
          suggest that 1) [6]-shogaol is extensively metabolized in
          these two models, 2) its metabolites are bioactive compounds,
          and 3) the mercapturic acid pathway is one of the major
          biotransformation pathways of [6]-shogaol.<br>
          <br>
          …Shogaols have gained interest because of recent discoveries
          revealing their higher anticancer potencies over gingerols. It
          is reported that [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerols had little to
          no effect but [6]-shogaol significantly inhibited the growth
          of A-2780 ovarian cancer cells (Rhode et al., 2007). Kim et
          al. (2008) reported that [6]-shogaol exhibited much stronger
          growth-inhibitory effects on A-549 human lung cancer cells,
          SK-OV-3 human ovarian cancer cells, SKMEL-2 human skin cancer
          cells, and HCT-15 human colon cancer cells than [4]-, [6]-,
          [8]-, and [10]-gingerols. A study from our group has also
          demonstrated that [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-shogaols exhibited much
          higher antiproliferative potency than [6]-, [8]-, and
          [10]-gingerols against H-1299 human lung cancer cells with
          IC50 values of 8 μM for [6]-shogaol and 150 μM for
          [6]-gingerol (Sang et al., 2009). Along with our
          collaborators, we have reported that [6]-shogaol was more
          effective than [6]-gingerol in inhibiting
          12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced tumor promotion
          in mice (Wu et al., 2010). Furthermore, Dugasani et al. (2010)
          found that [6]-shogaol showed the most potent antioxidative
          activity with an IC50 value of approximately 8 μM, whereas
          [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerols had IC50 values of 28, 20, and
          12 μM, respectively. <br>

          <br>
          Ginger, the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Roscoe
          (Zingiberaceae), has widely been used as a spice and condiment
          in different societies. Besides its food-additive functions,
          ginger has a long history of medicinal use for the treatment
          of a variety of human ailments including common colds, fever,
          rheumatic disorders, gastrointestinal complications, motion
          sickness, diabetes, cancer, etc. Ginger contains several
          nonvolatile pungent principles viz. gingerols, shogaols,
          paradols and zingerone, which account for many of its health
          beneficial effects. Studies conducted in cultured cells as
          well as in experimental animals revealed that these pungent
          phenolics possess anticarcinogenic properties. This chapter
          summarizes updated information on chemopreventive and
          chemotherapeutic effects of ginger-derived phenolic substances
          and their underlying mechanisms.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Background</b><br>
          <br>
          6-Shogaol is a promising antitumor agent isolated from dietary
          ginger (Zingiber officinale). However, little is known about
          the efficacy of 6-shogaol on leukemia cells. Here we
          investigated the underlying mechanism of 6-shogaol induced
          apoptosis in human leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo.<br>
          Methods<br>
          <br>
          Three leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells were used
          to investigate the apoptosis effect of 6-shogaol. A shotgun
          approach based on label-free proteome with LC-CHIP Q-TOF MS/MS
          was employed to identify the cellular targets of 6-shogaol and
          the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by
          bioinformatics protocols.<br>
          Results<br>
          <br>
          The present study indicated that 6-shogaol selectively induced
          apoptosis in transformed and primary leukemia cells but not in
          normal cells. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha
          (eIF2α), a key regulator in apoptosis signaling pathway, was
          significantly affected in both Jurkat and U937 proteome
          profiles. The docking results suggested that 6-shogaol might
          bind well to eIF2α at Ser51 of the N-terminal domain.
          Immunoblotting data indicated that 6-shogaol induced apoptosis
          through a process involving dephosphorylation of eIF2α and
          caspase activation–dependent cleavage of eIF2α. Furthermore,
          6-shogaol markedly inhibited tumor growth and induced
          apoptosis in U937 xenograft mouse model.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusion</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The potent anti-leukemia activity of 6-shogaol found both in
          vitro and in vivo in our study make this compound a potential
          anti-tumor agent for hematologic malignancies.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Description</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Ginger, obtained from the rhizome of Zingiber officinale
          (Family Zingiberaceae), has been used extensively as a spice
          and in traditional medicine. The compounds in ginger primarily
          responsible for its medicinal properties are the gingerols.
          Gingerols can undergo dehydration, during storage and
          processing, to form the corresponding shogaols. Studies
          conducted so far have primarily focused on the biological
          activities of ginger and 6-gingerol. The main objectives of
          this research were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and
          chemopreventive activities of gingerols and shogaols.<br>
          <br>
          The crude ginger extract was subjected to column
          chromatography to obtain a mixture of gingerols, a mixture of
          shogaols, 6- gingerol, 8-gingerol and 6-shogaol which were
          characterized using high pressure liquid chromatography and
          nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br>
          <br>
          The anti-inflammatory activity of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol was
          evaluated using the
          12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced mouse ear
          inflammatory model. Both 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol inhibited
          ear edema as well as the levels of proinflammatory cytokines.<br>
          <br>
          The primary focus of this study was to evaluate the
          chemopreventive potential of these compounds on prostate
          cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-3). We hypothesized that gingerols
          and shogaols exhibit their chemopreventive potential through
          the modulation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Cell
          viability studies indicated that, among the compounds tested,
          6-shogaol, 8-gingerol and shogaol mixture were the most
          effective in inhibiting cell growth in both cell lines.
          Morphological assessment, cell cycle, Annexin V staining and
          western blot analysis showed that 8-gingerol and 6-shogaol
          induced apoptosis in both the cell lines. Western blot
          analysis further confirmed our hypothesis that 8-gingerol and
          6-shogaol induced apoptosis through activation of the
          intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as seen by caspase-9 cleavage.
          In addition, 8-gingerol and 6-shogaol induced the production
          of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which correlated well with
          the induction of apoptosis. This suggests that production of
          ROS could be one of the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by
          these compounds.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that
          gingerols and shogaols isolated from ginger were able to
          inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. 6-shogaol and
          8-gingerol were able to induce apoptosis in both cell lines by
          activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.<br>

          Zingiber officinale Rosc. (Zingiberaceae) has been
          traditionally used in Ayurvedic, Chinese and Tibb-Unani herbal
          medicines for the treatment of various illnesses that involve
          inflammation and which are caused by oxidative stress.
          Although gingerols and shogaols are the major bioactive
          compounds present in Zingiber officinale, their molecular
          mechanisms of actions and the relationship between their
          structural features and the activity have not been well
          studied…<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusions</b><br>
          <br>
          6-Shogaol has exhibited the most potent antioxidant and
          anti-inflammatory properties which can be attributed to the
          presence of α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety. The carbon chain
          length has also played a significant role in making
          10-gingerol as the most potent among all the gingerols. This
          study justifies the use of dry ginger in traditional systems
          of medicine.<br>

          <br>
          Effect of [6]-gingerol, a major pungent component in ginger,
          on the proliferation of a rat ascites hepatoma AH109A cells
          was investigated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into
          acid-insoluble fraction of the cultured cells and that on the
          invasion by co-culturing the hepatoma cells with rat
          mesentery-derived mesothelial cells. [6]-Gingerol inhibited
          both the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells in a
          dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 6.25–200 μM
          (proliferation) and 50–200 μM (invasion). [6]-Gingerol
          accumulated cells in S phase and elongated doubling time of
          hepatoma cells, and increased the rate of apoptosis. Hepatoma
          cells previously cultured with hypoxanthine (HX) and xanthine
          oxidase (XO) or with hydrogen peroxide showed increased
          invasive activities. [6]-Gingerol suppressed the reactive
          oxygen species-potentiated invasive capacity by simultaneously
          treating AH109A cells with [6]-gingerol, HX and XO or with
          [6]-gingerol and hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, [6]-gingerol
          reduced the intracellular peroxide levels in AH109A cells.
          These results suggest that the suppression of hepatoma cell
          proliferation by [6]-gingerol may be due to cell cycle arrest
          and apoptosis induction. They also suggest that the
          anti-oxidative property of [6]-gingerol may be involved in its
          anti-invasive activity of hepatoma cells.<br>

          <b> </b><b>PRODUCTION OF GINGEROL AND SHOGAOL</b><br>
          PURPOSE:To industrially and simply obtain gingerol useful as a
          synthetic intermediate for shogaol, a perfume composition,
          etc., by reacting a specific gingerone with an aldehyde.
          CONSTITUTION:This gingerol of formula III is obtained by
          reacting a gingerone of formula I with a compound of formula
          II [(n) is 0-10] in the presence of an inert solvent such as a
          base such as sodium t-butoxide and an inert solvent such as
          THF. This shogaol of formula IV is obtained by heating the
          gingerol of formula III in the presence of an acid catalyst
          such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and an inert solvent such as
          toluene.<br>

          PURPOSE:To obtain an antiparasitic agent, containing
          [6]-shogaol and/or [6]- gingerol as an active ingredient and
          capable of exhibiting excellent anthelmintic effects on
          parasites, such as oxyurids or roundworms of Anisaxis spp.,
          parasitic on human digestive tracts. CONSTITUTION:An

          formula I and/or gingerol expressed by formula II as an active
          ingredient and having the above-mentioned effects.; The
          afore-mentioned compound is directly used or, together with a
          normally used pharmaceutical carrier, formed into an oral
          agent, e.g., tablet, capsule, granule, fine granule or powder,
          or a parenteral agent, such as injection, and can be
          administered to animals and humans and the following daily
          dose is considered as normally suitable for an adult.
          100-500mg in the case of oral administration and 0.5-100mg in

          <b> </b><b>ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT</b><br>
          PURPOSE:To provide an antimicrobial agent containing extract
          of ginger rhizome as an active component, exhibiting excellent
          bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity at a low dose, and
          useful especially as a preservative additive for foods.
          CONSTITUTION:The peices or powder of ginger obtained by
          cutting or grinding the rhizome of ginger, is extracted with a
          proper solvent such as alcohol, ketone, ester, etc. in hot
          state, and the extract is used as the active component usually
          in the form of liquid, and optionally after dispersing in a
          proper powdery carrier. An antimicrobial activity is attained
          by the synergistic effect of the pungent taste components of
          the extract such as zingerone, ginerol, shogaol, zingiberene,
          etc., the essential oil of ginger, and other minor components.
          The desirable effect can be achieved without lowering the
          taste, color, and flavor of the food, by adding about
          0.02-0.5% extract to the food<br>

          <b> </b><b>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SHOGAOL AND INTERMEDIATES
            FOR THE SYNTHESIS THEREOF</b><br>
          It is intended to provide a process for industrially producing
          shogaols which are useful in the fields of foods, perfumes,
          drugs, quasi drugs, cosmetics and so on. Namely, a novel
          intermediates represented by the following general formula and
          a process for producing shogaols via these intermediates.
          According to this process, shogaols, which can be hardly
          produced on a mass scale by the existing method of extracting
          from natural ginger, can be easily produced. Intermediate: In
          the above chemical formula (1), R&lt;1&gt; represents hydrogen
          or methyl; R&lt;2&gt; represents optionally branched C1-18
          alkyl; R&lt;3&gt; and R&lt;4&gt; independently represent each
          hydrogen, lower alkyl or a protective group of phenolic
          hydroxy; A represents C1-4 alkylene; and X represents
          benzenesulfonyl or toluenesulfonyl.<br>

          <b> </b><b>Separating and purifying method for shogaol</b><br>
          The shogaol separating and purifying process includes the
          following steps: 1. separating water, Kaempferia galanga oil
          and shogaol in the distilled mixture, and filtering to obtain
          coarse shogaol crystal; 2. adding alcohol or acetone in 1-3
          times the weight of coarse shogaol crystal into the coarse
          shogaol crystal and adding distilled water in 15-35 times the
          weight; 3. regulating pH value of the solution to 4-8, setting
          for 20-40 hr to separate crystal; and 4. filtering and vacuum
          drying to obtain high purity shogaol crystal. The product is
          used in medicine.<br>
