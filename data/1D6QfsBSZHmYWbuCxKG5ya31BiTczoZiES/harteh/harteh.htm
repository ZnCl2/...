      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>An excellent way to start on the EH Antenna would be to just
        read the material by Ted Hart (W5QJR) on web site
        http://www.eh-antenna.com. However not everybody has access to
        the Internet and I will give a very short precis of how Ted
        introduces his subject. </p>
      <p>It is some 120 years since Heinrich Hertz discovered that radio
        waves were periodic. For the last century our concept of the
        basic antenna has been a resonant half wave with other antennas
        being subsets of the basic Hertzian antenna. </p>
      <p>Also about 120 years ago John Henry Poynton discovered the
        components of radiation which are in brief: </p>
      <p>(1) There is an Electric (E) field and a Magnetic (H) field
        which must occur in the same space, be at right angles to each
        other and be in time phase. </p>
      <p>(2) The relationship between the E field in volts/metre and the
        H field in amp-turns/metre is equal to 377 ohms, the impedance
        of space. </p>
      <p>To enable radiation, the E and H fields must be developed which
        satisfy these requirements. We learn that the E field in a
        resonant Herzian half wave antenna is developed from the ends of
        the antenna where the voltage is greatest and the H field is
        developed essentially in the centre where the current is
        greatest. Apparently the correct relationships between the E and
        H fields don’t occur until around a third of a wavelength
        distance from the antenna where the fields are becoming weaker.
        So perhaps there is a better way! </p>
      <p>We have gone along with the basic Herzian antenna for a
        century. However in the 1980’s, Scottish Professor Maurice
        Hately (GM3HAT) correctly concluded that we didn’t need a large
        resonant antenna and radiation could be achieved by creating the
        fields in the correct relationship from correctly phased untuned
        field generating elements. As a result, Professor Hately,
        together with several associates, introduced (and in fact
        patented) various forms of the Crossed Field Antenna which were
        designed to generate the E and H fields at right angles, in
        phase and in the same (and comparatively small) space. Hence the
        name Crossed Field Antenna (CFA). </p>
      <p>Some of us will remember Ted Hart (W5QJR) who developed
        comprehensive formulae for the design of the Magnetic
        Transmitting Loop. Ted eventually became involved with
        documentation for the X Field antenna and went on to develop
        what he has called (and patented) the EH antenna. </p>
      <p>So, I had a go at assembling versions of this antenna, one each
        for 20 and 40 metres. The article is about how I assembled them
        and how they performed. </p>
      <p><b>Constructing an EH Antenna ~</b> </p>
      <p>The antenna consists of two tubular (or conical) plates with
        natural capacity between them. You might consider them to be a
        fat dipole (or fat bi-cone). The E field is generated by voltage
        across the plates and the H field by the displacement current in
        the dielectric between the two elements. (The fields
        intersecting at right angles are shown in Figure 1). </p>
      <p>What I have assembled is two samples of this antennas based on
        some construction ideas by Stefano (Steve) Galastri (IK5IIR)
        which can be found on the web site I have mentioned. Steve
        formed the dipole by wrapping sheets of copper around PVC
        plumbing tube. For my antenna, I selected plumbing tube which
        nicely fitted around recycled metal fruit containers which I had
        saved. So my tubular elements are on the inside of the tube
        instead of the outside. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1: Fields generated between the two cylinders ~</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="ehfield.jpg" height="287" width="301"></p>
      </center>
      <p>For a standard EH design, the Radiation Resistance (RL) is
        given as equal to 2? x 377 = 2368 ohms. An external matching
        network is required to transformation from 50 ohms unbalanced
        line to the balanced input of the dipole with 2368 ohms
        radiation resistance. A balanced form of L network is used with
        two inductors and two capacitors. It is an easy matter to
        calculate the value of these components as each must have a
        reactance equal to the square root of (50 x RL) which equals 344
        ohms. Adjustment of the network apparently also ensures that the
        displacement current is in phase with the voltage across the
        plates so that the E and H fields are in phase. From my
        experiments, the phase correction is that small that it is
        difficult to notice the deviation from the calculated values I
        have just quoted. </p>
      <p>At this point I must draw attention to the fact that in
        Australia our standard measurement units are metric. However all
        the data I have referenced is in imperial units. To avoid any
        confusion, both to myself and others reading this article in
        conjunction with the web site, I have purposely kept to the
        imperial system. </p>
      <p>The circuit diagram for my two units is shown in figure 2. I
        first assembled the 40 metre unit as shown in figure 3. For each
        cylinder (half dipole) I used two of our standard Australian
        fruit containers (fruit tins or fruit cans) which are 4 inches
        in diameter and 4.5 inches deep. The inside diameter of the PVC
        pipe I obtained was just a little over 4 inches, so the cans
        fitted in nicely. The cans were secured by self tapping screws
        which also doubled as connecting terminals where required. The
        can pairs were connected together by three straps on the outside
        of the tube. </p>

        <p><img src="fig340m.jpg" height="564" width="339"></p>
      </center>
      <p>I followed closely Steve’s arrangement for fitting a matching
        network. For the capacitor stators, I fitted cut down sections
        of more cans fitted inside the tube. For the adjustable sliders
        on the outside of the tube, I used further pieces of the tinned
        cans which are held in place by strong rubber bands. This allows
        them to be slid up and down to vary the capacitance made up by
        the two plates with the PVC tube as dielectric. If required,
        these can be glued in place later after adjustment is finalised.
      </p>
      <p>The lower inductor L1 has one less turn than the upper inductor
        L2. On testing, I found this needed slightly less inductance
        which I reasoned was probably due to the extra inductance of the
        very long lead between L1 and the top cylinder. </p>
      <p><b>Cylinder dimensions ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to the reference, cylinder diameter is not too
        important and my own tests seemed to confirm this. However, the
        ratio of cylinder length to diameter does control the radiation
        beam width. A low ratio gives a spread pattern more suitable for
        local contacts whereas, a higher ratio narrows the beam and
        gives a lower angle of radiation, more suitable for long
        distance (DX) communication. They say, typical ratios could vary
        from as low as 1.5 to an optimum figure of 3.14 for DX work. </p>
      <p>My ratios are somewhat set by the can dimensions. For the 40
        meter unit, the ratio is 2.4. Using this ratio, local reports
        consistently gave my signal as two S points below my half wave
        end fed inverted V antenna. At longer distances the difference
        was considerably greater. For the 20 meter unit, I tried to get
        the ratio a bit greater (again somewhat controlled by can
        sizes). For this unit the ratio is 2.85 and this works much
        better for distant stations. </p>
      <p>For 20 meters, the reference suggested 2 inch diameter
        cylinders. I only had cans just under 3 inches diameter, so my
        cylinders for 20 meters are a little larger than suggested. </p>
      <p><b>20 Metres ~</b> </p>
      <p>The assembly of the 20 metre unit is shown in figure 4. The
        arrangement is much the same as the 40 metre unit except that it
        is assembled with 3 inch diameter PVC plumbing tube which nicely
        takes another Australian standard fruit can which is just less
        than 3 inches in diameter. The can pairs are also a bit
        different. In the forty metre unit, I fixed each can in place
        separately and bonded them together. In the 20 metre unit I
        lapped ends of a pair, soldered them together and used only one
        set of screws to secure the pair in place. </p>
      <p>Once again with the 20 metre unit, I found the matching
        balanced better with slightly less inductance in L1. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4: VK5BR 20 metre EH Dipole ~</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig420m.jpg" height="525" width="347"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Isolation Coils ~</b> </p>
      <p>Not mentioned previously are two coils of a single turn shown
        on the 40 metre unit, one mounted just below the top cylinder
        and one mounted just above the bottom cylinder. According to the
        web references, this introduces a small amount of phase shift
        which reduces radiation from the connecting wires inside the
        tube and actually increases the radiation from the cylinders.
        Steve says that spacing between the winding and the cylinder
        edge is critical but I don’t know why. Anyway I have spaced my
        coils at 0.25 inch from the edge. </p>
      <p>I have not included these isolation coils in the 20 metre unit
        but I might later add them to see if I can notice any change in
        performance. </p>
      <p><b>Matching adjustment ~</b> </p>
      <p>The setting of L and C in the matching section is quite
        critical. Set the transmitter up on the centre frequency of the
        band with the transmitter set for about 10 watts output and look
        for low SWR. With the inductors, I put on more turns than I had
        calculated using Wheeler’s formula and took off a turn at a time
        adjusting to the extremities of C1 and C2 each time. I close
        wound the coils but inductance can be reduced by pushing the
        turns apart. When the adjustment gets close, the reflected power
        will drop and SWR will run right down rather suddenly close to
        1:1 when the right adjustment is found. When adjusted, I found I
        could light up a small BC fluorescent lamp from the field around
        the dipole with less than 15 watts. Low SWR also corresponds to
        maximum field strength as measured on a meter some distance
        away. </p>
      <p>After alignment I disconnected leads from the inductors and
        capacitors and measured their values. The measured inductance
        and capacitance values are recorded on the circuit diagram
        (figure 2) and are very close to values calculated from
        reactance using the formula quoted earlier with the assumed
        radiation resistance of 2368 ohms. </p>
      <p><b>Some Air Tests ~</b> </p>
      <p>To test the unit on the air, I made comparisons with an end fed
        Inverted V antenna which is a half wavelength long on 40 metres.
        On 20 metres it is a full wave long and operates, no doubt, with
        a rather complex arrangement of radiation lobes. </p>
      <p>In general, on receiving with the antenna about a metre above
        the ground, both antennas produced signals several S points
        below the inverted V although I did find an occasional signal on
        20 metres which appeared comparable with the inverted V. The
        receive level of the 20 metre antenna improved considerably when
        I raised the antenna to around 3 metres above the ground. </p>
      <p>On transmitting on 40 metres to stations in the local Adelaide
        metropolitan area, reports gave the signal down around two S
        points on the inverted V. It was down a bit further on distant
        stations. On the other hand, it seemed to work better than a
        random length of wire strung up to the nearest tree and tuned up
        with a Z Match. </p>
      <p>On transmitting on 20 metres some 1500 Km to the east coast of
        Australia, the EH dipole was just barely below the inverted V.
        This is quite impressive considering the dipole element is just
        20 inches (half a metre) long and a fraction of the length of
        the 20 metre full wave inverted V. </p>
      <p><b>Weather Proofing ~</b> </p>
      <p>My antennas, constructed as experimental units, are not made to
        withstand the elements without some form of protection or
        weather proofing. Without protection, the tin plate on the fruit
        cans would soon deteriorate and the cans would corrode. I could
        also envisage the many birds we have finding the hollow tube
        great to build a nest. The hollow tube would also be a great
        haven for spiders. Imagine having cooked spider as part of the
        dielectric between the two cylinders. However, the antenna would
        be fine if fitted under the tiles in the roof cavity or some
        other protected area.. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions and Comments ~</b> </p>
      <p>The concept of the basic antenna has certainly changed. The
        fact that long distance communication can be carried out with
        such a small sized antenna is quite revolutionary. However if
        you have the space for a full sized antenna and you have one
        installed, I wouldn’t dismantle it. From my tests, the full
        sized dipole (and complements of it) still works better. However
        if you live in a housing unit with limited yard space, one of
        these could be the way to go. </p>
      <p>Of course it could be that my assembled example of the EH
        antenna might not be an optimum design. For example, for the
        radiating cylinders, I have made use of discarded fruit cans
        which are tin plated steel. More expensive copper sheet or
        copper tube would have lower surface resistivity although with
        such a high radiation resistance I wonder if this would make
        much difference. However there is one thing that I wondered
        about. The steel is a ferro-magnetic material and I wondered if
        its magnetic properties might in some way distort the desired
        magnetic field and alter the properties of the antenna. </p>
      <p>Comparison of performance with the magnetic transmitting loop
        have been made. I felt I had better signal reports on 20 metres
        from my one metre square magnetic loop. However the magnetic
        loop has has extremely high Q and it has to be continuously
        retuned to traverse the frequency band. The EH antenna can be
        tuned up at the centre of the band and operated across the band
        without retuning. I found that it is possible to tune up with
        close to 1:1 SWR in the centre of the band and hold within 1.5:1
        over the whole band. </p>
      <p>Another point of comparison is the physical size. It’s not so
        apparent for the smaller magnetic loop on 20 metres but an
        efficient magnetic loop on 40 metres might need 10 metres (or
        around 33 ft) of copper pipe in the loop circumference. Compare
        this to the dimension of the radiating element of the 40 metre
        EH dipole described. </p>
      <p>A further feature of the EH antenna is its small capture area

        noise. </p>
      <p>The hertzian concept for antennas has been with us for a long
        time. But now we are introduced to a new exiting concept and a
        new avenue for experimentation, all based on electromagnetic
        wave theory discovered by John Henry Poynton 120 years ago. </p>

      <p><b>UPDATE APRIL 2003 ~</b> </p>
      <p>The preceeding article as published in <i>Amateur Radio</i> in
        April 2003 was prepared in September 2002 and theory included
        was that as known at that date. A lot of water has passed under
        the bridge since that time and a lot of controversy has since
        taken place concerning how it actually works. </p>
      <p>For a start, I had observed an anomaly in the original theory
        of how the H field was developed from the E field displacement
        current. I have placed an article on the internet describing a
        new theory on how I believe this is developed, refer
        http://www.qsl.net/vk5br/EHAntennaTheory.htm. In brief, I
        believe that whilst the E Field is developed in a differential
        mode across the cylinders, the H field is developed from the
        displacement current of a secondary E field in a longitudinal or
        common mode between the cylinders and reference coax shield
        common.. </p>
      <p>More recently it has been observed (
        http://www.qsl.net/vk5br/HFieldTests.htm ) that there is a field
        around the outside of the coax cable running a distance down the
        coax. This seems to be(
        http://www.qsl.net/vk5br/CoaxShieldTests.htm ) due to current
        running down the outer shield. Here is the source of the
        controversy. Some think that much of the radiation from the EH
        dipole is due to this current. Others believe it does not need
        the coax to work well. It is an interesting on going saga. </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Radiation Precaution ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In experimenting with these antennas, one
          should not forget that close proximity to the fields or
          radiation from any antenna could subject the body to higher
          than accepted safety levels. As far as the EH antenna is
          concerned, these fields have quite a high concentration within
          the vicinity of the two small dipole cylinders and the
          matching network. Care should be taken when the body is close
          to these, particularly when using high power. As mentioned in
          the previous paragraph, some field has been detected around
          the coax cable feeding the dipole unit. At this stage it is
          not known whether this might also reach a hazardous level and
          could possibly be of particular concern where the cable is run

      <p>[0001] The present patent application is a continuation-in-part
        of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/576,449, which is
        incorporated by reference in its entirety. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] <b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] The present invention relates to radio frequency
        communications and, more specifically, to an antenna system
        employed in radio frequency communications. </p>
      <p>[0004] <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>[0005] Radio signals usually start with electrical signals that
        have been modulated onto a radio frequency carrier wave. The
        resulting radio signal is transmitted using an antenna. The
        antenna is a system that generates an electrical field (E field)
        and a magnetic field (H field) that vary in correspondence with
        the radio signal, thereby forming radio frequency radiation. At
        a distance from the antenna, as a result of transmission effects
        of the medium through which the radio frequency radiation is
        being transmitted, the E field and the H field fall into phase
        with each other, thereby generating a Poynting vector, which is
        given by S=E.times.H, where S is the Poynting vector, E is the E
        field vector and H is the H field vector. </p>
      <p>[0006] Conventional Hertz antenna systems are resonant systems
        that take the form of wire dipoles or ground plane antennas that
        run electrically in parallel to the output circuitry of radio
        frequency transmitters and receivers. Such antenna systems
        require, for maximum performance, that the length of each wire
        of the dipole, or the radiator of the ground plane, be one
        fourth of the wavelength of the radiation being transmitted or
        received. For example, if the wavelength of the radiation is
        1000 ft., the length of the wire must be 250 ft. Thus, the
        typical wire antenna requires a substantial amount of space as a
        function of the wavelength being transmitted and received. </p>
      <p>[0007] A Crossed Field Antenna, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
        6,025,813, employs two separate sections which independently
        develop the E and H fields and are configured to allow combining
        the E and H fields to generate radio frequency radiation. The
        result is that the antenna is not a resonant structure, thus a
        single structure may be used over a wide frequency range. The
        Crossed Field Antenna is small, relative to wavelength
        (typically 1% to 3% of wavelength) and provides high efficiency.
        The Crossed Field Antenna has the disadvantage of requiring a
        complicated physical structure to develop the E and H fields in
        separate sections of the antenna. The Crossed Field Antenna also
        requires an associated complex matching/phasing network to feed
        the antenna. </p>
      <p>[0008] Radio Frequency Identification (RF ID) is an emerging
        field in which a small radio frequency transponder is embedded
        in or attached to objects so that the objects may be uniquely
        identified and carry associated information in the memory of the
        transponder. By international agreement these systems may
        operate on assigned frequencies from 125 KHz to 4 GHz, with many
        operating at 13.56 MHz. For practical applications, both the
        transponder and the associated "reader" of RF ID systems require
        small antennas, with loop antennas the preferred choice.
        However, with traditional Hertz loop antennas the distance
        between the reader and transponder is very limited and the
        transponder must be parallel to the reader antenna. This is due
        to low efficiency and narrow bandwidth, and the use of only a
        magnetic field concentrated around the loop conductor, without
        the benefit of local radiation. Therefore, there is a need for a
        compact antenna with high performance. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0009] The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the
        present invention which, in one aspect is an antenna system for
        transmitting and receiving, in association with a radio device,
        that develops an H-field and an E-field corresponding to a radio
        frequency power signal having a voltage and a current, the
        voltage having a phase relationship to the current. The antenna
        system includes a Hertz-type radiating element. A phasing and
        matching circuit is electrically coupled to the Hertz-type
        radiating element and to the radio device. The phasing and
        matching circuit provides conjugate impedance matching between
        the radio and antenna and adjusts the phase relationship between
        the voltage and the current of the radio frequency power signal
        so that the H-field and the E-field developed by the antenna
        system are in nominal time phase, thereby resulting in the
        formation of radiation at the antenna. </p>
      <p>[0010] In another aspect, the invention is an antenna system
        for transmitting and receiving, in association with a radio
        device, that develops an E-field and an H-field that correspond
        to a radio frequency power signal having a current and a voltage
        at a radio frequency. The current and the voltage are phase
        related. The antenna system includes a first radiating element
        made from a conductive material and a second radiating element
        made from a conductive material. The second radiating element is
        spaced apart from and in alignment with the first radiating
        element. A phasing and matching network is in electrical
        communication with the first radiating element, the second
        radiating element and the radio device. The phasing and matching
        network aligns the relative phase between the current and the
        voltage of the radio frequency power signal so that the H-field
        is nominally in time phase with the E-field. </p>
      <p>[0011] In yet another aspect, the invention is a loop antenna
        system that includes a loop-shaped conductor having a first end
        and a spaced-apart second end. A gap is defined between the
        first end and the second end. A capacitor electrically couples
        the first end to the second end. A shunt is electrically coupled
        to a first portion of the loop-shaped conductor. A T-type
        network is electrically coupled to the shunt. The T-type network
        is configured so the E-field is in nominal time phase with the
        H-field. </p>
      <p>[0012] These and other aspects of the invention will become
        apparent from the following description of the preferred
        embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings. As
        would be obvious to one skilled in the art, many variations and
        modifications of the invention may be effected without departing
        from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the
        disclosure. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>[0023] A preferred embodiment of the invention is now described
        in detail. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like
        parts throughout the views. As used in the description herein
        and throughout the claims, the following terms take the meanings
        explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly
        dictates otherwise: the meaning of "a," "an," and "the" includes
        plural reference, the meaning of "in" includes "in" and "on." </p>
      <p>[0024] A general discussion of Poynting vector theory may be
        found in the disclosure of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,495 and
        6,025,813, which are incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>[0025] The EH Antenna is a Hertz antenna driven with a phase
        shift network that allows radiation to occur at the antenna,
        with associated benefits. To put this in proper perspective, the
        equivalent circuit is shown in FIG. 1A. Note a RF source driving
        a EH Phasing Network followed by a matching network. The purpose
        of the matching network is to provide a conjugate impedance
        match to the antenna. For now, disregard the EH phase shift
        network (+j.phi.) while the Hertz antenna is defined. In one
        embodiment of the invention, the EH antenna is essentially a
        modified Hertz antenna. </p>
      <p>[0026] The equivalent circuit of a Hertz antenna includes both
        radiation resistance (R.sub.R) and loss resistance (R.sub.L) in
        addition to both inductance and capacitance denoted respectively
        as +jX.sub.L and -jX.sub.C. Each of these has a value that is a
        direct function of the physical characteristics of the antenna.
        Small Hertz antennas are capacitors with low inductance. In this
        case an external inductance is added to cancel the capacitive
        reactance, thus to resonate the antenna. The word resonance is
        used to indicate that the current applied to the antenna is in
        phase with the applied voltage, thus allowing maximum current
        flow, thus maximum power transfer from the source to the
        antenna. As the size of the antenna increases, both the capacity
        and the inductance increase until their reactance is equal when
        the antenna element is near 1/4 wavelength, allowing the antenna
        to be self resonant. These larger antennas also have a higher
        radiation resistance and a higher loss resistance. If the
        antenna is short in length but large in diameter, it will have a
        high capacity and low inductance. The effect is to reduce the
        amount of external inductance necessary for resonance, thus
        effectively increasing the bandwidth and, since the loss in the
        external inductance is proportional to size, to increase the
        efficiency of the system (the antenna+the network). </p>
      <p>[0027] The function denoted as -jD denotes the phase shift
        between the applied voltage and the displacement current through
        the natural capacity of the antenna. This signifies that the H
        field of a Hertz antenna leads the phase of the E field. This is
        an integral part of every Hertz antenna. </p>
      <p>[0028] The Hertz antenna is converted to an EH Antenna by
        inserting a phase shift network. This cancels the effect of -jD.
        When the phase of the current from the source is delayed 90
        degrees (+j.phi.) relative to the voltage, the E and H fields of
        the antenna are now in phase. </p>
      <p>[0029] The effect causes new components to be included in the
        antenna. An additional radiation resistance (R.sub.R) may be
        added to improve the efficiency of the antenna and enhance the
        bandwidth. An inductance (+jX.sub.L) may be added due to
        displacement current through the natural capacity of the
        antenna. This effectively increases the capacity of the antenna
        by subtracting from -jX.sub.C, thus reducing the amount of
        tuning inductance necessary in the network to resonate the
        system and reducing loss in the tuning inductor and lowering the
        Q. This component effectively increases the capacity by a factor
        of the square root of two for very small EH Antennas that do not
        have wire inductance. </p>
      <p>[0030] It should be noted that the value of the individual
        added components is a function of the physical configuration of
        the original Hertz antenna. For example, a small EH dipole has
        almost no inductance due to current on very short conductors.
        Because a small EH Antenna does not have an H field developed
        from inductance on a wire, it can be very small and exhibit
        overall high efficiency and large bandwidth. Further, since the
        EH Antenna concept fully satisfies the Poynting Theorem, it
        brings the beginning of radiation from the far field to the
        antenna. Therefore, large E and H fields are no longer required
        and thus EMI is virtually eliminated. When used as a receiving
        antenna, it does not respond to local independent E or H fields,
        thus it provides superior signal to noise ratio. </p>
      <p>[0031] The voltage and current applied to a Hertz antenna are
        in phase, therefore the E and H fields are not in phase, thus
        radiation does not occur until a great distance from the
        antenna. A proper phase shift network allows the Hertz antenna
        to become an EH Antenna where a 90 degree phase delay between
        the current and voltage cause the E and H fields to be in phase.
        Therefore, the EH antenna is able to transfer power from the
        transmitter directly to radiation. In the context of this
        paragraph, the word antenna includes both the physical structure
        and the conjugate matching network. </p>
      <p>[0032] To gain a better understanding of the EH Antenna
        concept, it is necessary to look at the phase between the E and
        H fields. As shown in FIG. 1B, the E field for a Hertz antenna
        is developed by the applied voltage. The H.sub.L field is
        developed by the current through the inductance of the antenna
        conductor, thus it is delayed in time phase. The clock
        convention is used for delay and lead. The H.sub.D field is
        developed by the displacement current through the natural
        capacity, thus it leads the applied voltage in time phase.
        Radiation can not be created at the Hertz antenna because the E
        and H fields are not in phase. </p>
      <p>[0033] The EH antenna is created by shifting the phase of the
        applied current relative to the applied voltage. This causes
        H.sub.L to be delayed an additional 90 degrees, and is now 180
        degrees relative to the applied voltage. H.sub.D has also been
        delayed 90 degrees and is now in phase with the applied voltage.
        In other words, the H.sub.L/H.sub.D vector is rotated counter
        clock wise. It would appear that H.sub.L subtracts from H.sub.D
        since they are 180 degrees relative to each other. However, it
        is believed that the entire useful H field of any antenna is
        caused by displacement current through the natural capacity. As
        evidence of this, a very small dipole EH antenna has almost no
        conductor inductance, thus H.sub.L is almost 0. Since E and
        H.sub.D are in phase, radiation is created at the antenna. This
        also implies that we can have a very efficient antenna since
        there is no loss resistance associated with H.sub.D. Further,
        since E and H.sub.D are in phase allowing power to be radiated,
        a large radiation resistance is created indicating an efficient
        power transfer from the EH Antenna to radiation. </p>
      <p>[0034] Since there is a necessary physical orientation between
        the E and H fields to cause radiation in accordance with the
        Poynting Theorem, the above can not be accomplished by using a
        phase lead in the EH network rather than a phase delay. This is
        further evidence that the H field of all antennas is developed
        by displacement current. </p>
      <p>[0035] The minimum size for an EH Antenna is determined by the
        allowable inefficiency and/or bandwidth for the intended use,
        which is dictated by the amount of antenna capacity resulting in
        the necessary external tuning inductance with its associated
        loss. A very small EH antenna has no measurable loss in the
        conductors, thus the total loss is in the phasing matching
        network. This is typically a small fraction of a dB. As an
        example, an EH Antenna dipole with 0.005 wavelength elements and
        a diameter of 1/3 the length produces radiation levels greater
        than a 0.5 wavelength Hertz dipole. </p>
      <p>[0036] As shown in FIG. 2, one embodiment of the invention is
        illustrated as an antenna system 100 for transmitting and
        receiving, in association with a radio device 102 (such as a
        transmitter or a receiver), having an E-field and an H-field
        that corresponds to a radio frequency power signal having a
        current and a voltage at a radio frequency. </p>
      <p>[0037] The antenna system 100 includes an antenna unit 110 and
        a phasing/matching network 120. The antenna unit 110 includes a
        first radiating element 112 made of a conductive material such
        as a metal (for example, aluminum) and a spaced-apart second
        radiating element 114, also made of a conductive material such
        as a metal. The first radiating element 112 and the second
        radiating element 114 are substantially in alignment with each
        other, so that both tend to be disposed along a common axis 116.
        While the first radiating element is ideally coaxial with the
        second radiating element, they may be off coaxial without
        departing from the scope of the invention. However, performance
        of the antenna may degrade as the radiating elements get further
        off coaxial. Typically, the height of the antenna unit 110 need
        only be about 1.5% of the wavelength. Thus, the invention allows
        for relatively compact antenna designs. </p>
      <p>[0038] In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the first radiating element
        112 and the second radiating element 114 each comprise a
        cylinder. As will be shown below, the radiating elements could
        include conic sections as well, or many other shapes (or
        combinations thereof), as will be readily understood by those of
        skill in the art of antenna design. </p>
      <p>[0039] The phasing and matching network 120 is in electrical
        communication with the first radiating element 112, the second
        radiating element 114 and the radio device 102. The phasing and
        matching network 120 shifts the relative phase between the
        current and the voltage of the radio frequency power signal so
        that the H-field of the antenna is nominally in time phase with
        the E-field. The wires connecting the phasing and matching
        network 120 to the antenna unit 110 should be as short as
        practical so as to minimize transmission line effects. Because
        the E field and the H field are substantially in phase with each
        other near antenna unit 110 a Poynting vector is created almost
        immediately near the antenna unit 110. </p>
      <p>[0040] In one illustrative embodiment, the phasing and matching
        network 120 includes a first inductor 122 that electrically
        couples a first terminal 104 of the radio device 102 to the
        first radiating element 112 and a first capacitor 124
        electrically couples a second terminal 106 of the radio device
        102 to the first radiating element 112. A second inductor 126
        electrically couples the second terminal 106 of the radio device
        102 to the second radiating element 114. A second capacitor 128
        electrically couples the first terminal 104 to the second
        radiating element 114. While one example of a reactive element
        circuit configuration embodying a phasing and matching network
        120 is shown in FIG. 2, it is understood that many other circuit
        configurations may be used without departing from the scope of
        the invention. </p>
      <p>[0041] An important feature of the phasing and matching network
        120 is that it performs the step of shifting the relative phase
        between the current and the voltage of the radio frequency power
        signal so that the H-field of the antenna is nominally in time
        phase with the E-field. As will be readily appreciated by those
        of skill in the art, the specific circuit elements and
        configuration used are unimportant so long as the result is
        proper performance of the phase shifting function. </p>
      <p>[0042] In one specific example of and EH antenna having an
        operating frequency of 7 MHz with a bandwidth of 500 KHz, the
        first inductor 122 has an inductance of 17 .mu.H, the first
        capacitor 124 has a capacitance of 30 pf, the second inductor
        has an inductance of 19 .mu.H and the second capacitor has a
        capacitance of 42 pf. The phasing and matching network 120 is
        connected to the transmitter/receiver 102 by a coaxial cable
        (not shown). The first radiating element 112 and the second
        radiating element 114 are each aluminum cylinders having a
        height of 12 in. and a diameter of 4.5 in. and are spaced apart
        by 4.5 in. It was observed that this embodiment resulted in a
        system Q (+/-3 dB bandwidth) of approximately 14. </p>
      <p>[0043] In one embodiment of the antenna unit 210, as shown in
        FIG. 3, the first radiating element 212 and the second radiating
        element 214 each comprise conic sections that are supported by
        an axial non-conducting pipe (such as a PVC pipe). In this
        embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation 232 forms between the
        radiating elements 212 and 214 and is directed radially away
        from the antenna unit 210. The angle of the conic sections of
        the radiating elements 212 and 214 depends on many factors and
        can vary depending on the specific application. The angle
        between the operative surfaces 218 of the radiating elements 212
        and 214 can be selected in a range from nearly zero degrees
        (forming extremely wide diameter cones) to 180.degree. (forming
        coaxial cylinders, as shown in FIG. 2). Theoretically, if the
        operative surfaces are exactly parallel (such that they form
        parallel disks) then the electromagnetic radiation would not
        escape the disks. </p>
      <p>[0044] In one specific embodiment, used to transmit or receive
        a radiation having a wave length of 934 feet at 1 MHz, the wide
        ends of the conic sections have a diameter of 14.49 feet and a
        height of 1.95 feet each, with a 30.degree. angle between the
        operative surfaces 218. In this embodiment, the radiating
        elements 212 and 214 are supported by a coaxial 8 in. PVC pipe.
      </p>
      <p>[0045] As shown in FIG. 4, a first cover 316 may be added to
        the first radiating element 312 to keep rain, snow and bird
        nests, etc., out of the first radiating element 312. Similarly,
        a second cover 318 may be added to the second radiating element
        314 to keep out similar such debris. </p>
      <p>[0046] As shown in FIG. 5, the antenna unit 410 may be placed
        in a reflective shape 430. Such an embodiment could be used in
        directing a beam 432 at a selected object. Such a shape 430
        could be a parabolic reflector or some other shape (such as an
        inverted cone). When the beam is directed upward by the
        reflective shape 430 so that the beam 432 follows a near
        vertical profile, the embodiment of FIG. 5 could be used in near
        vertical incidence communications. </p>
      <p>[0047] As shown in FIG. 6, one type of L-type network 500,
        which can be used as a phase shift element between two
        impedances that have no reactance, includes an inductor 502 and
        a capacitor 504. The L-type network 500 could transform between
        50+j0 ohms and 25+j0 ohms and have a corresponding phase delay
        of 45 degrees. Phase delay means that the current is delayed
        relative to the voltage. In other words, if the voltage and
        current are in phase at the input to the network, at the output
        of the network (if it is properly terminated) the current will
        be delayed 45 degrees relative to the voltage. </p>
      <p>[0048] As shown in FIG. 7, a T-type network 600 includes a
        first inductor 606 that is in series with a second inductor 602.
        The first inductor 606 and the second inductor 602 electrically
        couple the transmitter to the antenna. A capacitor 604 couples a
        common node between the first inductor 606 and the second
        inductor 602 to ground. A T-type network 600 is versatile in
        that it can match most source impedances to most load impedances
        with any desired phase shift and allows a predetermined amount
        of phase delay as desired for any particular antenna requiring a
        phase delay of less than 180 degrees. For antennas requiring a
        nominal 180 degrees, an L-type network 500 can be used to
        precede a T-type network 600, thus reducing the amount of phase
        shift required of the T-type network 600. It should be noted
        that a T-type network must operate between a low and high
        impedance to effect phase delay, thus the antenna impedance was
        chosen to be 60 ohms, expecting the nominal source impedance to
        be 50 ohms. </p>
      <p>[0049] As shown in FIG. 8, a hybrid network 800 could include a
        balun network 700 followed by a first L-type network 500a to
        transform from 200 ohms to 100 ohms with a delay of 45 degrees.
        The balun network 700 may be used for transformation from a low
        to a high impedance. If the tap on the inductor 706 is set at
        50% and if the input impedance is 50 ohms, then the output
        impedance will be 200 ohms. An impedance matching network 708
        may be included, immediately prior to the radiating elements of
        the antenna to ensure that the antenna is in resonance, if the
        radiating elements are not already matched. The first L-type
        network 500a could be followed by a second L-type network 500b
        with another 45 degrees for a total of 90 degrees phase delay.
        The total network would have an impedance transformation from
        50+j0 to 50+j0 ohms. The hybrid network 800 could be used in the
        direct conversion of a "tuned" Hertz antenna to a EH Antenna.
        Since the antenna has been resonated and matched to the
        transmission line (assume 50 ohms), a 1:4 balun could be used to
        transform the line impedance to 200 ohms. This would be followed
        by the first L-type network 500a transforming the impedance to
        100 ohms with an attendant 45 degree phase delay. The second
        L-type network 500b would provide a final transformation to 50
        ohms and an additional 45 degrees. Thus, a phase shift network
        of 90 degrees could be added to convert the Hertz antenna to an
        EH Antenna. </p>
      <p>[0050] One example of an antenna useful for application to RF
        identification systems is a small loop antenna, which is used as
        the transmitting/receiving antenna in association with the
        remote transponder. The small loop antenna is the converse of a
        small dipole. To create an EH loop antenna, the phase between
        the E and H fields is controlled to bring the fields into time
        alignment. A loop antenna system 900 is shown in FIG. 9. The
        loop antenna system 900 includes a loop-shaped conductor 910
        having a first end 912 and a spaced-apart second end 914. A gap
        920 being defined between the first end 912 and the second end
        914. A capacitor 916 electrically couples the first end 912 to
        the second end 914. A shunt 918 is electrically coupled to a
        first portion 922 of the loop-shaped conductor 910. A T-type
        network 600 that is electrically coupled to the shunt 918 and to
        a transmitter via a coaxial cable 902. The loop 910 is resonated
        with the capacitor 916 and the loop is shunt 918 fed (or fed
        across the tuning capacitor). For a shunt 918 feed, the
        impedance can have a nominal impedance of 50+j0. </p>
      <p>[0051] In using a loop antenna for one RF Identification
        system, before the transformation of a loop to an EH antenna, a
        resistor was required to reduce the Q of the antenna (damping
        resistor) due to the wide band modulation used. Test results
        without the resistor and after being converted to an EH Antenna
        indicate excellent performance with all types of transponders
        and there is no heat inside of the closed container of the
        antenna. In addition, the performance was enhanced in another
        way. Before transformation, it was difficult or impossible to
        communicate with transponders that were not oriented in a zero
        degree position (transponder and loop antenna in parallel).
        Using the EH concept, the enhanced fields of the antenna allowed
        communication with a transponder having any arbitrary
        orientation. Further; the transformation allows a significant
        reduction of the transmitter power or a significant in range. </p>

        illustrative examples only. It will be readily appreciated that
        many deviations may be made from the specific embodiments
