      <b>Abstract </b>--- Disclosed herein are a method of
      mass-producing nanosilver, a method of manufacturing
      nanosilver-coated antibacterial fiber, and antibacterial fiber
      manufactured thereby. Nanosilver having a size of 5 nm or less can
      be produced on a mass scale by applying an electric field of
      10,000 to 300,000 volts (DC) across two Ag electrode plates
      equipped in a water electrolysis system and allowing only a
      microcurrent to flow between the electrode plates. The
      nanosilver-coated, antibacterial fiber is manufactured by applying
      a aqeous solution of the nanosilver to the surface of the
      synthetic fibers, adsorbing the nanosilver onto the cloth using a
      process selected from the group consisting of thermal fixation,
      high frequency radiation, bubbling, and combinations thereof; and
      conducting a post-finishing at 160 to 200 DEG C. And thus, an
      antibacterial fiber manufactured thereby may be a fundamental
      solution to the synthetic fiber's problems, that is, poor
      perspiration functionality and the generation of statistic
      electricity.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Technical Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a method for producing
      nanosilver on a large scale, a method of manufacturing
      nanosilver-adsorbed fiber, and antibacterial fiber manufactured
      thereby. More particularly, the present invention relates to the
      method for producing nanosilver on a large scale having a size of
      5 nm or lower by allowing only a minute electric current to flow
      between two opposite silver electrodes in the presence of a high
      voltage in a water electrolysis system, a method of manufacturing
      nanosilver-adsorbed fiber by taking advantage of the better
      applicability of smaller silver particles, and an antibacterial
      fiber manufactured thereby.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] A variety of microbes are found in large quantities in
      daily living environments. Particularly, they grow and proliferate
      on clothes and form flora even on the skin. The microbes degrade
      fibers or digest nutrients in sweat or contaminants, producing bad
      odors or causing great damage to the health of humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] WHO reports that microbial contamination corresponds to
      about 30% of the mortality in the world. Unfortunately, current
      scientific technologies fall short of sufficiently controlling
      harmful microbes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therefore, it is intensively researched to develop
      antimicrobial/germicidal agents or products that are satisfied
      with harmless to human bodies and have improved functionality.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As representative example of the antimicrobial agents, it
      is known that silver can absolutely suppress almost all single
      cell pathogens. Because of such antimicrobial activity, silver has
      been used long and widely in antimicrobial fields, for example,
      tableware, such as bowls, spoons, chopsticks, etc., and herbal
      medicines such as silver-coated pills.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] As for the antibacterial function of silver, it is
      reportedly based on the activity of suppressing certain enzymatic
      reactions essential for the metabolism of pathogens, thus killing
      them.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Particularly in association with nano technology, silver in
      a nano state exhibits more powerful antibacterial and germicidal
      activity. Many research results report that silver in a nano state
      can kill as many as 650 kinds of bacteria and other microbes and
      show powerful suppression against fungi.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In addition, the smaller silver particles are, the more
      powerful antibacterial/germicidal activity, because silver becomes
      to the increase in surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] According to experimental data, silver powders show 99.9%
      antibacterial and germicidal efficiency over a variety of
      bacteria, including enterobacteria, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Salmonella, Vibrio, shigella, Pneumococcus, typoid, and even MRSA
      (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). That means that
      almost no bacteria can survive 5 minutes or longer in contact with
      nanosilver.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] While having tenfold more potent suppression against
      bacteria than the conventional chloride-based agent, a nanosilver
      does not damage human bodies at all. Therefore it is expected to
      be a useful therapeutic agent against various inflammations. In
      addition, taking advantage of nanosilver, various functional
      products having antibacterial and deodorizing activities are on
      the market.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In the fiber and textile industries, accordingly, it is key
      point to produce nanosilver having such excellent effects on a
      large scale and to effectively intercalate the nanosilver into
      fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In past three decades, synthetic fibers have been used in a
      wide range of fields of human life as complements to or
      substitutes for natural fibers and even as materials that are
      functionally superior to natural fibers. During this period,
      synthetic fibers for clothes have been developed towards
      practicality, comfort, and other functionalities. Furthermore, it
      has been actively researched to environment- and body-friendly
      synthetic fibers in recent. In a persistent effort to develop
      synthetic fibers that satisfy the above request, the antibacterial
      activity of nanosilver is applied to fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Conventionally, nanosilver has been extracted using a
      physical method, such as liquid phase reduction, grinding, etc.,
      or an electrolytic method. The electrolytic method is conducted
      under low temperature and voltage that silver having 99.9% of
      contents is added to distilled water, and then the
      silver-containing compounds are electrolyzed and carried to
      electrophoresis through the (+) and (-) of each molecule, results
      in collecting nanosilver.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] On the other hand, as a representative method to
      intercalate nanosilver into fibers, synthetic fibers are
      manufactured by mixing nanosilver with raw synthetic fiber
      materials before the synthetic fibers are spun. However, the
      fibers, which are synthesized in the above mentioned method, is
      poor in antibacterial or germicidal activity because most silver
      is deeply intercalated into synthetic fibers while only a small
      amount of silver is exposed on the surfaces of synthetic fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Alternatively, antibacterial agents, such as silver, silver
      oxide, nanosilver etc., are coated onto synthetic fibers. However,
      the antibacterial agents have poor adhesive strength with
      synthetic fibers; therefore the synthetic fibers are inferior to
      washing durability.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Leading to the present invention, intensive and thorough
      research, conducted by the present inventors, on antibacterial
      fibers and cloth resulted in the finding that nanosilver must be
      exposed in a larger amount on the surface of synthetic fibers,
      rather than be embedded within them, in order to maximize the
      germicidal or antibacterial effect of silver. The smaller the
      synthetic fibers are, the more powerful antibacterial/germicidal
      activities are. Also, In order to obtain the smaller nanosilver,
      it is designed that the mass production of nanosilver is generated
      by keeping up with minute electronic current between the two Ag
      electrodes in water electrolysis system to high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a
      method for producing nanosilver on a large scale.<br>

      <br>
      [0021] It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an
      antibacterial fiber manufactured thereby.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a
      method for producing nanosilver on a large scale is provided. More
      practically, the nanosilver on a large scale is generated by
      controlling a minutely electronic current between the two Ag
      electrodes in water electrolysis system, while a voltage of
      10,000300,000 is applied to two Ag electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] An object of the invention is to provide a nanosilver on a
      large scale, preferably comprising; loading water so as to immerse
      the two Ag electrode plates in the water electrolysis system,
      applying voltage of 10,000300,000 to two Ag electrodes, moving the

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] First, a method for producing nanosilver on a large scale
      is described according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention. The method for producing nanosilver on a large scale is
      provided, based on the electrolysis of water in which, while high
      voltage, namely 10,000300,000 V, is applied to two Ag electrodes
      (104, 105), the nanosilver on a large scale are generated by
      keeping up with minute electric current between the two electrodes
      by controlling the height of the circuit breaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 1 shows a device for preparing the aqueous solution
      containing the nanosilver in accordance with the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] More practically, the method for producing nanosilver on a
      large scale by using a water electrolysis system comprises:<br>
      <br>
      loading water so as to immerse the two Ag electrodes;<br>
      applying voltage of 10,000300,000 to two Ag electrodes;<br>
      moving the circuit breaker upwards or downwards with the voltage,
      and thus controlling minutely electric current between the two Ag
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The water electrolysis system comprises,<br>
      <br>
      [0042] a water reservoir (101) provided with a water inlet valve
      (102) for introducing water thereinto and a water outlet (103)
      valve for draining the water therefrom;<br>
      <br>
      [0043] the two Ag electrode plates (104, 105) connected to a DC+
      electric power source and a DC- electric power source
      respectively, the two Ag electrode plates being provided on
      respective opposite sides of the water reservoir (101);<br>
      <br>
      [0044] a circuit breaker (107) for dividing the water reservoir
      (101) into two sections, being located of a middle of the water
      reservoir (101); and<br>
      <br>
      [0045] a groove (106) formed by the circuit breaker(107).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art
      that the water reservoir, the water inlet valve, the water outlet
      valve, and the circuit breaker are all electrically insulated.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Generally, it was widely acknowledged that an electric
      current rises in proportion to voltage, in accordance with the
      following Formula 1. When low voltage is applied, electric current
      can be controlled using circuits, diodes and the like. However
      when high voltage is applied, current control is generally
      impossible.<br>
      Voltage(V)=Current(I)*Resistance(R) [Formula 1]<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Therefore, the present invention is characterized that
      while a high voltage, 10,000300,000 V, is applied to electrolysis
      system, the electric current control is possible in high voltage.
      When the high voltage is applied, it is accomplished that the
      circuit breaker (107) installed at a middle portion of the water
      reservoir (101) is moved upwards or downwards to allow only minute
      electric current between the two electrodes. So, the nanosilver on
      a large scale is generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In more detail, when the circuit breaker (107) is absent,
      electric current flowing through the water reservoir with a
      certain voltage follows Formula 1. The other side, the circuit
      breaker (107) is controlled by [1/2] the height of the water
      reservoir (101), the electric current flows on the decrease until
      [1/2].<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Thus, while high voltage, 10,000300,000 V is applied to two
      Ag electrodes, the nanosilver on a large scale is generated by
      keeping up with minute electric current between the two electrodes
      by controlling the height of the circuit breaker.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The electric current control is conducted until the
      nanosilver size becomes 5 nm or less and preferably 1 to 5 nm.
      When exceeding 5 nm in size, nanosilver particles lose the
      property of being easily adsorbed, characteristic of nanosilver,
      which is generated, because their surface area is decreased. In
      addition, if the electric current amount is not controlled to the
      high voltage, silver ions are not isolated to produce nano
      particles, but silver plating occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 2 shows the particle distribution prepared in the
      presence of a high voltage in the aqueous solution containing the
      nanosilver according to the present invention. The particle
      distribution is observed using scanning electron microscopy. FIG.
      2 shows that the nanosilver having a size of 5 nm or less is
      uniformly distributed. However, FIG. 3 shows the particle
      distribution prepared in the presence of a low voltage in the
      aqueous solution containing the nanosilver according to
      conventional method. FIG. 3 shows that the particles are
      non-uniformly distributed, with particle aggregations found
      therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In addition, the nanosilver prepared according to the
      exemplary embodiment of the present invention is in a nanosilver
      solution state so that the nanosilver particles are uniformly
      distributed, and the nanosilver can be uniformly and readily
      coated or adsorbed on synthetic fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention is
      related to a method manufacturing nanosilver-adsorbed fiber. The
      method is comprised of; preparing aqueous solution containing the
      nanosilver synthesized on a large scale; scouring and washing
      synthetic fibers; applying the aqueous solution containing the
      nanosilver to the surface of the synthetic fibers; adsorbing the
      nanosilver onto the synthetic fibers using a process selected from
      the group consisting of thermal fixation, high frequency
      radiation, bubbling, and combinations thereof; and conducting
      post-finishing at 160 to 200[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The method may further comprise a dyeing step before the
      post-finishing.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The nanosilver-adsorbed fiber may be carried out on general
      cloth types, for example, leather, natural fibers, and synthetic
      fibers, and preferably with synthetic fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The term "synthetic fiber" as used herein means generic
      fiber made from raw chemical materials, such as polyester, nylon,
      acryl, etc. Preferably, synthetic fiber has smooth surface such
      that the nanosilver can be easily adsorbed thereon, in contrast
      with natural fibers consisting of warp and weft. In the case of
      natural fibers, nanosilver is deeply intercalated into natural
      fibers, thus antimicrobial activity is poor. The application of
      the aqueous solution containing the nanosilver to the surface of
      synthetic fibers may be carried out using a spraying method, a
      coating method, or a dipping method followed by coating using a
      knife or a roll knife.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The antibacterial fiber is preferably adsorbed with
      nanosilver in an amount of 0.01 to 0.1 g per 100 g of synthetic
      fibers. According to the exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention, large amounts of nanosilver can be adsorbed on the
      synthetic fibers in comparison to conventional methods. When the
      amount of the nanosilver adsorbed on the synthetic fiber is less
      than 0.01 g, the synthetic fibers have insufficient antibacterial
      activity. On the other hand, if the amount of the nanosilver
      adsorbed on the synthetic fibers is more than 0.1 g, the cost for
      excessively increases relative to the improvement of antibacterial
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The adsorption of the nanosilver onto the surface of
      synthetic fibers may be achieved using various processes. An
      example among preferred processes is a thermal fixation process at
      150 to 230[deg.] C. The thermal fixation process makes the cloth
      flexible. Here, when the temperature during the process is below
      150[deg.] C., the surface of raw fiber becomes too flexible. On
      the other hand, when the temperature during the process is higher
      than 230[deg.] C., the surface of raw fiber becomes too stiff.
      Thermal fixation process is needed to be carried out under about 2
      atm.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Another process for the adsorption of the nanosilver onto
      the surface of the synthetic fibers uses high-frequency radiation.
      The high-frequency radiation process uses an ultrasonic wave
      frequency that exceeds the upper limit of the range of audio
      frequencies (16 to 16000 Hz). Generally, ultrasonic waves may be
      generated by applying an ultrasonic signal produced in an electric
      circuit to an ultrasonic oscillator. The irradiation of ultrasonic
      waves onto the nanosilver solution produces innumerable fine
      voids. The innumerable fine voids are helpful in adsorbing the
      nanosilver onto the surface of synthetic fibers.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Another process for the adsorption of the nanosilver onto
      the surface of the synthetic fibers may be accomplished through
      bubbling. In this process, nanosilver particles, ionized by
      electrolysis, are oscillated leftwards and rightwards, upwards and
      downwards, or backwards and forwards by the bubbling. The
      oscillation of the nanosilver particles activates mobility, which
      is accelerated in the presence of a voltage, so that the
      nanosilver particles are uniformly distributed over the synthetic
      fibers. To carry out the above process using the bubbling, the
      target synthetic fibers are immersed in a separate inner vessel
      placed inside the water reservoir which has a plurality of
      openings through which bubbles are generated at a lower portion of
      the water reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Next, post-finishing is conducted, in which the synthetic
      fibers having nanosilver adsorbed thereon are ironed at 160 to
      200[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In addition, a dyeing process may be further conducted
      before the post-finishing. In the dyeing process, the
      nanosilver-adsorbed fiber may be dyed at about 130[deg.] C. for 3
      to 5 hours with a mixture of a dye and a dispersant.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] An antibacterial fiber prepared according to the exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention includes nanosilver adsorbed
      thereon in an amount from 0.01 to 0.1 g per 100 g of the synthetic
      fibers. The synthetic fibers have excellent antibacterial activity
      because the nanosilver particles are intensively adsorbed on the
      surface thereon.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The antibacterial fiber is semi-permanently maintained
      washing durability, since the antibacterial fiber was manufactured
      by easily adsorptive properties of the nanosilver itself. Test
      results for washing durability of the antibacterial fiber made of
      nanosilver-adsorbed fiber reveals that the nanosilver remained
      thereon even after 50 washes.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In addition, the nanosilver is intensively adsorbed onto
      the surface of the synthetic fibers. Therefore, the antibacterial
      fiber according to the exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention is excellent to antibacterial activity, and
      simultaneously can prevent poor perspiration functionality and the
      generation of static electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] A better understanding of the present invention may be
      obtained in light of the following examples, which are set forth
      to illustrate, but are not to be construed to limit the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>

      </b><b>[0068] Step 1: Preparation of Aqueous Solution Containing
        the Nanosilver</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0069] As shown in FIG. 1, the device for preparing aqueous
      solution containing the nanosilver comprises a water reservoir
      (101), provided with a water inlet valve (102) for introducing
      water thereinto and a water outlet (103) valve for draining the
      water therefrom; the two Ag electrodes (104, 105) connected to a
      DC+ electric power source and a DC- electric power source
      respectively, the two Ag electrodes being provided on respective
      opposite sides of the water reservoir (101); a circuit breaker
      (107) for dividing the water reservoir (101) into two sections,
      being located of a middle of the water reservoir (101); and a
      groove (106) being formed owing to the circuit breaker (107).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In this device, water was loaded on the water reservoir
      (101) with the level of immersing the two Ag electrodes (104,
      105). Next, 30,000 V was applied across the two Ag electrodes in
      the water electrolysis system. The mass production of nanosilver
      was generated by keeping up with minute electric current between
      the two electrodes by controlling the height of the circuit
      breaker (107) to the water reservoir (101).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The nanosilver thus prepared was proven to have a size of 5
      nm or less, with uniform particle distribution as measured using a
      scanning electron microscope (Model LEICA-STEROSCAN440) in FITI
      Testing &amp; Research Institute of Korea (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0072] Step 2: Preparation of Antibacterial Fiber</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] Synthetic fibers were washed with water and scoured at a
      maximum temperature of 125[deg.] C. so that the synthetic fibers
      were made clean and neat.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Thereafter, the synthetic fibers were immersed in aqueous
      solution containing the nanosilver. Here, the temperature of the
      aqueous solution containing the nanosilver for the adsorption
      process was maintained at 230[deg.] C. under a pressure of about 2
      atm, so that the nanosilver was thermally fixed on the surface of
      the synthetic fibers. In order to ensure the thermal fixation of
      the nanosilver onto the synthetic fibers, ultrasonication was
      conducted and bubbles were generated to accelerate the mobility of
      the nanosilver particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Afterwards, a dye and a dispersant were mixed in acetic
      acid and the synthetic fibers were dyed at 130[deg.] C. for 3 to 5
      hours, followed by post-finishing in which the cloth was pressed
      at 200[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0076] An antibacterial fiber was manufactured in a same manner to
      that of Example 1, with the exception that the circuit breaker
      (107) was controlled to cause the size of nanosilver to be 5 rn or
      less in the presence of 300,000 volts (DC+, DC-) in Step 1 of

      <br>
      [0078] As seen in FIG. 3, the nanosilver prepared in Comparative
      Example 1 was observed to aggregate together, with a non-uniform
      particle distribution under a SEM (model: LEICA-STEROSCAN440) in
      FITI Testing &amp; Research Institute of Korea.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] While this invention has been described in connection with

      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a colloidal nanosilver

      characterized by not containing toxic or impure substances and is
      suitable for use in sanitation, disinfection, or as antimicrobial
      agent for treatment of patients. The present invention also
      relates to a method for making the colloidal nanosilver solution
      by interacting silver oxide first with ammonia water then with
      hydrazine hydrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] It has been known for centuries that silver possesses
      germicidal properties and has been employed as germicide before
      modern antibiotics were developed. During those days, users would
      shave silver particles into their drinking water, or submerge
      whole silver pieces in the drinking water, for the purpose of
      ingesting silver by drinking the water. Even after the onset of
      modem antibiotics era, silver remains to be used as antimicrobial
      agent, particularly because microorganisms treated by silver do
      not acquire resistance to the metals, while the conventional
      antibiotics often induce the formation of antibiotic-resistant
      microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Silver is a safe and effective antimicrobial metal. In the
      late eighteenth century, western scientists confirmed that silver,
      which had been used in oriental medicine for centuries, was an
      effective antibacterial agent. Scientists also knew that the human
      body fluid is colloidal. Therefore, colloidal silver had been used
      for antibacterial purposes in the human body. By the early
      nineteenth century, colloidal silver was considered the best
      antibacterial agent until the discovery of the antibiotics. Due to
      the potency and revenue-driven advantages of antibiotics, the
      antibiotics gradually substituted colloidal silver as the main
      choice for antibacterial agent. However, thirty years into the
      discovery of the antibiotics, scientists began to discover that
      antibiotics induced the development of antibiotic-resistant
      bacterial strains which significantly affected the efficiency of
      antibiotics. Therefore, since 1870s, silver has again been
      recognized as a preferred antibacterial use, particularly due to
      its non-toxic and non-induction of bacterial-resistant
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] There are many reasons why administering silver suspended
      in solution (e.g., colloidal silver) would enhance an individual's
      health. It is possible that such a solution operates to inhibit
      the growth of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other unwanted
      organisms, as well as eradicating such existing bacteria, fungi,
      viruses, and other organisms. It is also possible that a solution
      of silver can have an anti-inflammatory effect, sufficient to
      reduce symptoms of asthma. Silver in solution might also act in a
      similar fashion to a homeopathic remedy.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There have been numerous attempts to produce silver-based
      solutions, including colloidal silver. However, many of the
      silver-based products fail to maintain the silver particles in
      suspension, either because the silver solution is not a true
      colloid or because it is otherwise unstable. When the suspension
      of the silver particles fails, the particles fall to the bottom of
      the solution, thereby reducing the solution's concentration of
      silver and rendering it less effective.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the invention to be presented in the following sections,
      a colloidal nanosilver solution will be disclosed. The colloidal
      nanosilver solution of the present invention can maintain the
      colloidal nanosilver particles in suspension for a long period of
      time. It also has the advantages of not containing toxic or impure
      substances so that it is particularly suitable for medicinal and
      healthcare use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] The present invention provides a colloidal nanosilver
      solution containing nanosilver particles with sizes ranged between
      1 nm and 100 nm in diameter, the silver content in the colloidal
      nanosilver solution is about 0.00% to 0.4% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The colloidal nanosilver solution also comprises a gelling
      agent, which is starch or its derivative, cellulose or its
      derivative, polymer or copolymer of acrylate or acrylate
      derivative, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, alginic acid, or xanthogenated
      gel. Examples of starch derivative include, but are not limited
      to, sodium carboxymethyl starch, hydroxyethyl starch, and
      pregelatinized starch. Examples of cellulose derivative include,
      but are not limited to, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
      hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and hydroxyethyl cellulose. An
      example of polymer or copolymer of acrylate derivative is
      carbomer, which is a carboxy vinyl polymer. Carbomer generally are
      high molecular weight ("MW") polymers (MW above 1,000,000).
      Carbomer is commercially available. B. F. Goodrich Company
      currently sells carbomer using the tradename of Carbopol. Carbopol
      934P has a MW of about 3,000,000 and Carbopol 940 is about
      4,000,000. The preferred Carbopol is Carbopol 934P. The preferred
      concentration of the gelling agent is at about 0.2 to 5% by weight
      of the total solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The colloidal nanosilver solution has antimicrobial
      activity, particularly for inhibiting growth of bacteria, fungi,
      or chlamydia. Examples of microorganisms which can be inhibited by
      the colloidal nanosilver solution include, but are not limited to,
      Escherichia coli, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
      Chlamydia trachomatis, Providencia stuartii, Vibrio vulnificus,
      Pneumobacillus, Nitrate-negative bacillus, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Candida albicans, Bacillus cloacae, Bacillus allantoides, Morgan's
      bacillus (Salmonella morgani), Pseudomonas maltophila, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus
      foecalis alkaligenes, Streptococcus hemolyticus B, Citrobacter,
      and Salmonella paratyphi C.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention also provides a method for making the
      colloidal nanosilver solution. The method includes the following
      steps: (1) dissolving silver oxide (Ag2O) in ammonia water
      (NH3.H2O) to form a solution containing silver ammino ion
      [Ag(NH&lt;3&gt;)&lt;+&gt;]; (2) dissolving a gelling agent in
      water to form a gelling medium; (3) mixing the silver ammino
      ion-containing solution with the gelling medium to form a
      colloidal nanosilver ammino ion-containing solution; and (4)
      mixing the colloidal nanosilver ammino ion-containing solution
      with hydrazine hydrate (NH2NH2.H2O) to form the colloidal
      nanosilver solution. The ammonia water used in step (1) is
      preferred to be at a concentration of 28% by weight. Also, the
      silver oxide and the ammonium water in step (1) is preferred to be
      at a ratio of about 1:7 to about 1:10 (w/v). In addition, the
      silver oxide and the hydrazine hydrate in step (4) is preferred to
      be at a ratio of about 1:0.087 to about 1:0.26 (w/v).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It is preferred that the colloidal nanosilver ammino
      ion-containing solution is mixed with hydrazine hydrate
      (NH2NH2.H2O) at about 0 to 45[deg.] C. for about 0.5 to 2 hours.
      Also, after the formation of the colloidal nanosilver solution, it
      is preferred to let the colloidal nanosilver solution be in
      contact with air for about 0.5 to 5 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The colloidal nanosilver solution can be used as an
      antibacterial or antifingal agent for treatment of patients with
      bum and scald-related skin infection, wound-related skin
      infection, dermal or mucosal bacterial or fungal infection,
      surgery cut infection, vaginitis, and acne-related infection, by
      applying or spraying the solution onto the wounds. It can also be
      used as a disinfectant or sanitary agent to clean areas in need of
      disinfection or sanitation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] The present invention provides a colloidal nanosilver
      solution which contains nanosilver particles having diameters with
      sizes ranged between 1 nm and 100 nm. A colloid is a gelatinous or
      mucinous dispersion medium that consists of particles which are
      larger than an ordinary crystalloid molecule, but are not large
      enough to settle out under the influence of gravity. These
      particles normally range in size from 1 to 100 nm. There are
      generally two kinds of colloids: (1) Suspension colloids
      (suspensoids), in which the dispersion medium consists of
      particles that are insoluble, such as a metal, and the dispersion
      medium may be gaseous, liquid, or solid. (2) Emulsion colloids
      (emulsoids), in which the dispersion medium is usually water and
      the disperse phase consists of highly complex organic substances,
      such as starch or glue, which absorb much water, swell, and become
      uniformly distributed throughout the dispersion medium. The
      suspension colloids tend to be less stable than the emulsion
      colloids. The colloidal nanosilver solution of the present
      invention is a hybrid of both the suspension and the emulsion
      colloids.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The colloidal nanosilver solution of the present invention
      is further characterized by its non-toxic and purity nature, as
      well as its stability. The silver content in the colloidal
      solution is between 0.001% to 0.4% by weight. It is also stable at
      room temperature (about 25[deg.] C. or 77[deg.] F.) for at least
      110 days. Because of these characteristics, the colloidal
      nanosilver solution is particularly suitable for use in healthcare
      related matters such as sanitization and disinfection.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The colloidal nanosilver solution of the present invention
      can be used in sanitary products, which include, but are not
      limited to, solutions for cleansing agents for clothing, women
      hygiene, acne or pimples, and soaking solution for tooth brush. It
      can also be used in healthcare products, which include, but are
      not limited to, treating patients with all kinds of injuries
      and/or burns, bacterial and fungal infections (including
      gynecological infections such as vaginitis), gastrointestinal
      bacterial infection, and sexually transmitted diseases. In
      addition, the colloidal nanosilver solution of the present
      invention can be used in industrial products, which include, but
      are not limited to, food preservatives especially for fruits and
      vegetables, drinking water disinfectants, paper and construction
      filling materials preservation (especially to prevent mold
      formation).<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The colloidal nanosilver solution of the present invention
      possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal
      ability. It can kill and suppress growth of bacteria and fungi,
      such as Escherichia coli, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Providencia stuartii, Vibrio
      vulnificus, Pneumobacillus, Nitrate-negative bacillus,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Bacillus cloacae,
      Bacillus allantoides, Morgan's bacillus (Salmonella morgani),
      Pseudomonas maltophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus foecalis alkaligenes,
      Streptococcus hemolyticus B, Citrobacter, and Salmonella paratyphi
      C.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the colloidal
      nanosilver solution of the present invention has advantage over
      the conventional antibiotics in killing and suppressing bacterial
      growth, as it does not induce drug-related resistance in the
      bacterial or fungal strains.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Conventionally, a colloidal silver solution is prepared by
      reducing silver nitrate (AgNO3) to metallic silver with reducing
      agent such as glucose, ascorbic acid, hydrazine hydrate, hydrazine
      sulfate, and formaldehyde. The term "colloidal silver solution" as
      used in this context refers to a colloidal solution containing
      silver particles where the sizes of the silver particles are not
      necessarily within the nanometer range in the "colloidal
      nanosilver solution" as described in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Under this preparation method, other than silver, oxidized
      products of the reducing agents, which are possibly toxic, are
      generated. The presence of these oxidized products not only affect
      the purity of the colloidal silver solution but also make the
      colloidal silver solution unsuitable for use in healthcare related
      industry due to its toxicity. Also, although the oxidized products
      of the reducing agents can be removed from the colloidal silver
      solution by conventional methods, such as dialysis, the method of
      dialysis involves excessive steps which not only is time-consuming
      but also adds more difficulties and expenses to the
      industrial-scale manufacturing process.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] To avoid producing unwanted toxic products, at least two
      methods are disclosed which produce a colloidal silver solution
      containing harmless side products from the reducing agents. For
      example:<br>
      <br>
      [0021] (1) Reacting silver oxide (Ag2O) with hydrogen gas to form
      metallic silver and water:<br>
      Ag2O+H2-&gt;2Ag+H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0022] (2) Reacting silver oxide (Ag2O) with hydrazine hydrate
      (NH2NH2.H2O) to form metallic silver, nitrogen gas, and water.<br>
      2Ag2O+NH2NH2.H2O-&gt;4Ag+N2+3H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Because the above reactions produce metallic silver,
      nitrogen gas, and water, which are non-toxic in nature so that no
      additional steps are necessary for removing the unwanted toxic
      products, theoretically, they should be suitable for the
      production of colloidal silver solution. However, the reactions as
      shown above are not practical in manufacturing industrial-scale
      colloidal nanosilver solution. For example, in the reaction as
      described in (1), which requires the silver oxide to interact with
      hydrogen gas, a multiphase reaction is involved which make it very
      difficult to carry out. See V. Kohlschuetter Strassburg (Z.
      Elektrochem., 14, 49-63. CA: 2: 1379-1380). When the silver oxide
      and hydrogen are sealed in a glass tube and reacted at 18[deg.] C.
      or lower, the reduction reaction takes place very slowly. On the
      other hand, if the reaction is carried out at 60[deg.] C. or
      lower, the hydrogen gas is discharged into the saturated silver
      oxide solution, which results in yielding a colloidal silver
      solution with silver particles partially in suspension and
      partially precipitated. A colloidal silver solution prepared in
      this way is not suitable for use in sanitation or healthcare
      products due to precipitation of silver.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Also, in the reaction as described in (2) above, the
      interaction of silver oxide with hydrazine hydrate in water is
      limited by the low solubility of the silver oxide in water. See J.
      Voigt et al. (Z. Anorg. Allgem. Chem. 164, 409-419, CA21:3512).
      Therefore, in order to obtain a soluble silver oxide solution, the
      silver content of the silver oxide solution must be no more than
      0.001% by weight. Using such a diluted silver oxide solution as
      starting material, the resulting silver content in the colloidal
      silver solution is too low to be effective for sanitation or
      healthcare use.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The present invention provides a method for making a
      colloidal nanosilver solution which is distinctively different
      from the prior art methods. Based on this method, a colloidal
      nanosilver solution which contains high silver concentration
      (i.e., containing 0.001% to 0.4% by weight of silver), high
      stability in the colloidal state (i.e., stable at room temperature
      for no less than 110 days), and no toxic substances, is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The method for preparing the colloidal nanosilver solution
      of the present invention contains the following reactive steps:<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (1) Dissolution of Silver Oxide in Ammonia Water (N3.H2O).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Silver oxide (Ag2O) is dissolved in concentrated ammonia
      water (NH3.H2O) to obtain a silver ammino oxide
      [Ag(NH3)&lt;+&gt;]2O solution where the silver ion is in the form
      of silver ammino ion [Ag(NH3)&lt;+&gt;] in as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Ag2O+2NH3.H2O-&gt;[Ag(NH3)&lt;+&gt;]2O+2H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The concentrated ammonia water is preferred to be about
      28%. The preferred ratio of silver oxide and ammonium water is at
      about 1:7 to about 1:10, w/v. This procedure has the advantage of
      increasing the solubility and concentration of silver in the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] (2) Dissolution of Gelling Agent in Water to Form a Gelling
      Medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A gelling medium is provided by dissolving a gelling agent
      in water. This gelling medium serves as a protective gel/colloid
      mechanism for keeping the nanosilver particles suspended in the
      colloidal nanosilver solution and preventing the nanosilver
      particles from aggregating with each other to form bigger pellets
      and precipitate. Preferably, the concentration of the gelling
      agent is between 0.2% to 5% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The gelling agent can be a synthetic or natural polymer or
      a combination thereof, which can be readily dissolved in water.
      Examples of the gelling agent include, but are not limited to,
      starch or starch derivatives, cellulose or cellulose derivatives,
      polymer or copolymer of acrylate or acrylate derivatives,
      polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), alginic acid, and xanthogenated gel.
      The starch derivatives include, but are not limited to, sodium
      carboxymethyl starch, hydroxyethyl starch, and pre-gelatinized
      starch. The cellulose derivatives include, but are not limited to,
      methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl
      cellulose, and hydroxyethyl cellulose. The polymer or copolymer of
      acrylate or acrylate derivative is preferred to be Carbomer.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Carbomer is a polymer of acrylic acid (or a carboxy vinyl
      polymer). It is currently sold under the tradename of Carbopol by
      B. F. Goodrich Company. The preferred carboxy vinyl polymer is a
      high molecular weight (preferably MW above 1,000,000; and most
      favorably MW above 3,000,000) polymer, such as Carbopol 934P which
      has a molecular weight of about 3,000,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Carbopol is the trademark of B. F. Goodrich Company's
      carboxy vinyl polymers, which generally are high molecular weight
      ("MW") polymers (MW above 1,000,000). Specifically, Carbopol 934P
      has a MW of about 3,000,000 and Carbopol 940 is about 4,000,000.
      The preferred Carbopol is Carbopol 934P.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] (3) Mixing Silver Ammino Oxide Solution with the Gelling
      Medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The silver ammino oxide [Ag(NH3)&lt;+&gt;]2O solution is
      thoroughly mixed with the gelling medium to form a uniformly
      dispersed silver ammino oxide-gelling solution to be used for the
      next reaction. The silver ammino oxide-gelling medium is preferred
      to be controlled at about 0[deg.] to 45[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] (4) Reaction of Silver Ammino Ion with Hydrazine Hydrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The silver ammino ion is further interacted with hydrazine
      hydrate in the presence of oxygen gas to form metallic silver,
      nitrogen gas, and water as follows:<br>
      [Ag(NH3)&lt;+&gt;]2O+NH2NH2.H2O+2O2-&gt;2Ag(metallic)+2 N2+6H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The preferred temperature for the above reaction is at
      about 0[deg.] C.-45[deg.] C. The reaction is preferred to be
      conducted in about 0.5 to 2 hours. The silver ammino oxide and
      hydrazine hydrate are preferred to be at a ratio of 1:0.087 to
      1:0.26 by weight. The nanosilver particles prepared by the
      reactive steps (1)-(4) have diameter of 1 nm to 100 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Because hydrazine hydrate is toxic, after the completion of
      step (4), the colloidal nanosilver solution is preferred to be
      kept in the presence of air for additional 0.5 to 5 hours so that
      the residue of hydrazine hydrate in the final colloidal nanosilver
      solution can be decomposed into nitrogen and water by the
      following oxidative reaction:<br>
      NH2NH2.H2O+O2-&gt;N2+3H2O<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The resulting nitrogen gas and water are non-toxic so that
      no removal of the side products is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Moreover, the present invention provides a method for
      making the colloidal nanosilver solution of high silver
      concentration, high stability in the gel state, and no toxic
      ingredients. The above mentioned problems associated with the
      reaction are solved in the present invention: the solubility of
      silver oxide and final concentration of silver in the colloidal
      solution are improved, the colloidal nanosilver is stabilized as
      the gel state in the solution, and the toxic reactant, hydrous
      ammonia, is carefully removed from the colloidal nanosilver
      solution by further decomposition reaction with oxygen in the air.
      The colloidal nanosilver solution of the present invention is
      suitable for healthcare purposes and serves as an effective
      antimicrobial agent.<br>
      <br>

      the scope of the present invention. Reasonable variations, such as
      those occur to reasonable artisan, can be made herein without
      departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>

      <br>
      [0084] II. Method:<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Microbial strains tested were Escherichia coli, Methicillin
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia trachomatis,
      Providencia stuartii, Vibrio vulnificus, Pneumobacillus,
      Nitrate-negative bacillus, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans
      (ATCC 10231), Bacillus cloacae, Bacillus allantoides, Morgan's
      bacillus (Salmonella morgani), Pseudomonas maltophila, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus
      foecalis alkaligenes, Streptococcus hemolyticus B, Citrobacter,
      and Salmonella paratyphi C. These strains were either isolated
      from clinical cases or purchased as standard strains from Chinese
      Biological Products Testing and Standardizing Institute.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] A typical example of the test, as illustrated by Candida
      albicans (ATCC 10231), was as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Colloidal nanosilver solutions of examples 1-4 (each
      contains a concentration of 1370 [mu]g/ml of silver) were tested
      for its antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The
      colloidal nanosilver solutions were diluted in distilled water to
      make the final concentrations of 137 [mu]g/ml, 68.5 [mu]g/ml, 45.7
      [mu]g/ml, 34.2 [mu]g/ml, and 27.4 [mu]g/ml. In the control group,
      no colloidal nanosilver solution was added. Candida albicans was
      added to each tested and control groups, respectively, and the
      viability of the fungus in each group was examined 2 minutes after
      incubation with the colloidal nanosilver solutions of examples
      1-4.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Typically, due to the resilience of Candida Albicans, a
      higher concentration of disinfectant is required to kill or
      suppress the growth of Candida albicans than for killing bacteria
      such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] III. Results:<br>
      <br>
      [0090] There was an average of 99.99% killing rate (1.78*10&lt;6
      &gt;cfu/mu) for all of the colloidal nanosilver solution tested
      (Examples 1-4) after 2 minutes of incubation. Among the same
      example, the most diluted sample demonstrated about the same
      fungicidal activity as the least diluted one.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0091] IV. Conclusion:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0092] The colloidal solution containing nanosilver particles of
      the present invention was effective as antimicrobial agent even at
      a diluted concentration of 27.4 [mu]g/ml of silver.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Fabrication of electronic circuit elements using liquid
      deposition techniques is of profound interest as such techniques
      provide potentially low-cost alternatives to conventional
      mainstream amorphous silicon technologies for electronic
      applications such as thin film transistors (TFTs), light-emitting
      diodes (LEDs), RFID tags, photovoltaics, etc. However the
      deposition and/or patterning of functional electrodes, pixel pads,
      and conductive traces, lines and tracks which meet the
      conductivity, processing, and cost requirements for practical
      applications have been a great challenge. Silver is of particular
      interest as conductive elements for electronic devices because
      silver is much lower in cost than gold and it possesses much
      better environmental stability than copper. There is therefore a
      critical need, addressed by embodiments of the present invention,
      for lower cost methods for preparing liquid processable, stable
      silver-containing nanoparticle compositions that are suitable for
      fabricating electrically conductive elements of electronic
      devices.<br>

      hydrated form. Exemplary examples of the hydrazine compound are as
      follows:<br>
      <br>

      benzylhydrazine oxalate, butylhydrazine hydrochloride,
      butylhydrazine oxalate salt, and propylhydrazine oxalate salt.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Hydrazide (e.g., RC(O)NHNH2 and RC(O)NHNHR' and
      RC(O)NHNHC(O)R) where one or both nitrogen atoms are substituted
      by an acyl group of formula RC(O), where each R is independently
      selected from hydrogen and a hydrocarbon group, and one or both
      nitrogen atoms are optionally mono- or di-substituted with R',
      where each R' is an independently selected hydrocarbon group.
      Illustrative examples of hydrazide are for example, formic
      hydrazide, acethydrazide, benzhydrazide, adipic acid dihydrazide,
      carbohydrazide, butanohydrazide, hexanoic hydrazide, octanoic
      hydrazide, oxamic acid hydrazide, maleic hydrazide,
      N-methylhydrazinecarboxamide, and semicarbazide.<br>
      <br>

      ROC(O)NHNH2 and ROC(O)NHNHC(O)OR) where one or both nitrogen atoms
      are substituted by an ester group of formula ROC(O), where each R
      is independently selected from hydrogen and a hydrocarbon group,
      and one or both nitrogen atoms are optionally mono- or
      di-substituted with R', where each R' is an independently selected
      hydrocarbon group. Illustrative examples of carbazate are for
      example, methyl carbazate (methyl hydrazinocarboxylate), ethyl

      where each R' is an independently selected hydrocarbon group.
      lullustraive examples of sulfonohydrazide are for example,
      methanesulfonohydrazide, benzenesulfonohydrazine,

      hydrazine acetate, aminoguanidine, thiosemicarbazide, methyl
      hydrazinecarbimidothiolate, and thiocarbohydrazide.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Unless otherwise indicated, in identifying the substituents
      for R and R' of the various hydrazine compounds, the phrase
      "hydrocarbon group" encompasses both unsubstituted hydrocarbon
      groups and substituted hydrocarbon groups. Unsubstituted
      hydrocarbon groups may be for example a straight chain alkyl
      group, a branched alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group,
      an alkylaryl group, and an arylalkyl group. Exemplary alkyl groups
      include for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl,
      heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl,
      tetradecyl, pentadecyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and
      isomeric forms thereof. Substituted hydrocarbon groups may be the
      unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups described herein which are
      substituted one, two or more times with for example a halogen
      (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine), nitro, cyano, an alkoxy
      group (e.g., methoxyl, ethoxyl, and propoxy), or a mixture
      thereof. In embodiments, the hydrocarbon group may be optionally
      substituted alkyl and optionally substituted aryl.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In embodiments, the hydrazine compound is other than a
      hydrazine and a hydrazine salt; in other embodiments, the
      hydrazine compound is other than a hydrazide; and in further
      embodiments, the hydrazine compound is other than a hydrazine, a
      hydrazine salt, and a hydrazide.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] One, two, three or more reducing agents may be used. In
      embodiments where two or more reducing agents are used, each
      reducing agent may be present at any suitable weight ratio or
      molar ratio such as for example from about 99(first reducing
      agent):1(second reducing agent) to about 1(first reducing
      agent):99(second reducing agent). The amount of reducing agent
      used in the embodiments of the present invention is for example
      about 0.25 molar equivalent or more per mole of silver compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Any suitable stabilizer may be used which has the function
      of minimizing or preventing the silver-containing nanoparticles
      from aggregation in a liquid and optionally providing the
      solubility or dispersibility of silver-containing nanoparticles in
      a liquid. In addition, the stabilizer is thermally removable which
      means that the stabilizer can be caused to dissociate from the
      silver-containing nanoparticle surface under certain conditions
      such as through heating. The heating may be accomplished to a
      certain temperature such as for example below about 250 degree C.,
      or below about 200 degree C., under normal atmospheric conditions
      or at a reduced pressure of for example from several mbars to
      about 10&lt;-3 &gt; mbar. The thermal dissociation of the
      stabilizer from the silver-containing nanoparticles at a
      temperature such as for example lower than about 250 degree C. may
      result in the evaporation of the stabilizer or decomposition of
      the stabilizer into gaseous forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In embodiments, the stabilizer may be an organic
      stabilizer. The term "organic" in "organic stabilizer" refers to
      the presence of carbon atom(s), but the organic stabilizer may
      include one or more non-metal heteroatoms such as nitrogen,
      oxygen, sulfur, silicon, halogen, and the like. Exemplary organic
      stabilizers include for instance thiol and its derivatives, amine
      and its derivatives, carboxylic acid and its carboxylate
      derivatives, polyethylene glycols, and other organic surfactants.
      In embodiments, the organic stabilizer is selected from the group
      consisting of a thiol such as for example butanethiol,
      pentanethiol, hexanethiol, heptanethiol, octanethiol, decanethiol,
      and dodecanethiol; an amine such as for example ethylamine,
      propylamine, butylamine, penylamine, hexylamine, heptylamine,
      octylamine, nonylamine, decylamine, and dodecylamine; a dithiol
      such as for example 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1,3-propanedithiol, and
      1,4-butanedithiol; a diamine such as for example ethylenediamine,
      1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane; a mixture of a thiol and a
      dithiol; and a mixture of an amine and a diamine. Organic
      stabilizers containing a pyridine derivative (e.g., dodecyl
      pyridine) and/or organophosphine that can stabilize
      silver-containing nanoparticles are also included as a stabilizer
      in embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In embodiments, the stabilizer is an organoamine such as
      for example butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine, heptylamine,
      octylamine, nonylamine, decylamine, hexadecylamine, undecylamine,
      dodecylamine, tridecylamine, tetradecylamine, diaminopentane,
      diaminohexane, diaminoheptane, diaminooctane, diaminononane,
      diaminodecane, diaminooctane, dipropylamine, dibutylamine,
      dipentylamine, dihexylamine, diheptylamine, dioctylamine,
      dinonylamine, didecylamine, methylpropylamine, ethylpropylamine,
      propylbutylamine, ethylbutylamine, ethylpentylamine,
      propylpentylamine, butylpentylamine, tributylamine, trihexylamine,
      and the like, or mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] One, two, three or more stabilizers may be used. In
      embodiments where two or more stabilizers are used, each
      stabilizer may be present at any suitable weight ratio or molar
      ratio such as for example from about 99(first stabilizer):
      1(second stabilizer) to about 1(first stabilizer):99(second
      stabilizer). The amount of the stabilizer used is for example
      about 1 or more molar equivalents per mole of silver compound, or
      about 2 or more molar equivalents per mole of silver compound, or
      about 10 or more molar equivalents per mole of silver compound, or
      about 25 or more molar equivalents per mole of silver compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In embodiments, the silver-containing nanoparticles may
      form a chemical bond with the stabilizer. The chemical names of
      the stabilizer provided herein are before formation of any
      chemical bond with the silver-containing nanoparticles. It is
      noted that the nature of the stabilizer may change with the
      formation of a chemical bond, but for convenience the chemical
      name prior to formation of the chemical bond is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The attractive force between the silver-containing
      nanoparticles and the stabilizer can be a chemical bond and/or
      physical attachment. The chemical bond can take the form of for
      example covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, coordination complex
      bonding, or ionic bonding, or a mixture of different chemical
      bondings. The physical attachment can take the form of for example
      van der Waals' forces or dipole-dipole interaction, or a mixture
      of different physical attachments.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The extent of the coverage of stabilizer on the surface of
      the silver-containing nanoparticles can vary for example from
      partial to full coverage depending for instance on the capability
      of the stabilizer to stabilize the silver-containing nanoparticles
      in the solvent. Of course, there is variability as well in the
      extent of coverage of the stabilizer among the individual
      silver-containing nanoparticles.<br>
      [0063] Any suitable solvent can be used for the reaction mixture
      including for example organic solvents and/or water. The organic
      solvents include for example hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane,
      hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, undecane,
      dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, and
      the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,
      pentanol and the like; tetrahydrofuran; chlorobenzene;
      dichlorobenzene; trichlorobenzene; nitrobenzene; cyanobenzene;
      acetonitrile; and mixtures thereof. One, two, three or more
      solvents may be used. In embodiments where two or more solvents
      are used, each solvent may be present at any suitable volume ratio
      or molar ratio such as for example from about 99(first solvent):
      1(second solvent) to about I(first solvent):99(second solvent).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The reaction of the silver compound with the reducing agent
      is carried out at a suitable temperature of for example from about
      -50[deg.] C. to about 200[deg.] C., or from about 0[deg.] C. to
      about 150[deg.] C., particularly at a temperature ranging for
      example from about 20[deg.] C. to about 120[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The silver-containing nanoparticles have a particle size of
      for example less than about 100 nm, less than about 50 nm, less
      than about 25 nm, or less than about 10 nm. The particle size is
      defined herein as the average diameter of silver-containing
      particle core, excluding the stabilizer, as determined by
      transmission electron microscopy ("TEM"). Generally, a plurality
      of particle sizes may exist in the silver-containing nanoparticles
      obtained from the preparation. In embodiments, the existence of
      different sized silver-containing nanoparticles is acceptable.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In embodiments, the silver-containing nanoparticles are
      composed of elemental silver or a silver composite. Besides
      silver, the silver composite includes either or both of (i) one or
      more other metals and (ii) one or more non-metals. Suitable other
      metals include for example Al, Au, Pt, Pd, Cu, Co, Cr, In, and Ni,
      particularly the transition metals for example Au, Pt, Pd, Cu, Cr,
      Ni, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary metal composites are Au-Ag,
      Ag-Cu, Au-Ag-Cu, and Au-Ag-Pd. Suitable non-metals in the metal
      composite include for example Si, C, and Ge. The various
      components of the silver composite may be present in an amount
      ranging for example from about 0.01% to about 99.9% by weight,
      particularly from about 10% to about 90% by weight. In
      embodiments, the silver composite is a metal alloy composed of
      silver and one, two or more other metals, with silver comprising
      for example at least about 20% of the nanoparticles by weight,
      particularly greater than about 50% of the nanoparticles by
      weight. Unless otherwise noted, the weight percentages recited
      herein for the components of the silver-containing nanoparticles
      do not include the stabilizer.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Silver-containing nanoparticles composed of a silver
      composite can be made for example by using a mixture of (i) a
      silver compound (or compounds) and (ii) another metal salt (or
      salts) or another non-metal (or non-metals) in the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The preparation of silver-containing nanoparticle
      compositions, which are suitable for the preparation of conductive
      elements for electronic applications can be carried out using all
      or some of the following procedures: (i) addition of a scavenger
      to the final reaction mixture from the preparation of
      silver-containing nanoparticles to destroy excess reducing agent;
      (ii) concentrating the reaction mixture by removing solvent; (iii)
      adding the concentrated reaction mixture to a non-solvent (or vice
      versa) to precipitate the silver-containing nanoparticles; (iv)
      collecting the silver-containing nanoparticles by filtration or
      centrifugation to result in isolated silver-containing
      nanoparticles (with the stabilizer molecules on the surface of the
      silver-containing nanoparticles); (v) dissolving or dispersing
      (assisted by for example ultrasonic and/or mechanical stirring)
      the isolated silver-containing nanoparticles (with molecules of
      the stabilizer on the surface of the silver-containing
      nanoparticles) in an appropriate liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Silver-containing nanoparticle compositions can also be
      made by mixing silver-containing nanoparticles with other metal or
      non-metal nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In embodiments, it may be possible to form a
      silver-containing nanoparticle composition (with stabilizer
      molecules on the surface of the silver-containing nanoparticles)
      suitable for forming conductive elements for electronic
      applications without the need for the above described procedures
      to isolate the silver-containing nanoparticles from the reaction
      mixture. In such embodiments, the reaction mixture (optionally
      augmented with another liquid which may be the same or different
      from the solvent used in the reaction mixture) may be considered
      the silver-containing nanoparticle composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The scavengers that can be used to destroy excess reducing
      agent include for example ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or a
      mixture thereof. Specific exemplary scavengers include acetone,
      butanone, pentanone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and
      the like, or a mixture thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Suitable non-solvents that can be used for the
      precipitation of silver-containing nanoparticles include any
      liquids that are mixable with the reaction solvent or solvents for
      the preparation of silver-containing nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The liquid that can be used to disperse or dissolve
      silver-containing nanoparticles to form a silver-containing
      nanoparticle composition includes organic liquids or water. The
      organic liquids include for example hydrocarbon solvents such as
      pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane,
      undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, toluene, xylene,
      mesitylene, and the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,
      propanol, butanol and the like; tetrahydrofuran; chlorobenzene;
      dichlorobenzene; trichlorobenzene; nitrobenzene; cyanobenzene;
      acetonitrile; and mixtures thereof. One, two, three or more
      liquids may be used. In embodiments where two or more solvents are
      used, each solvent may be present at any suitable volume ratio or
      molar ratio such as for example from about 99(first liquid):
      1(second liquid) to about 1(first liquid):99(second liquid).<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Exemplary amounts of the components of the
      silver-containing nanoparticle composition are as follows. The
      silver-containing nanoparticles and the stabilizer are present in
      an amount ranging for example from about 0.3% to about 90% by
      weight, or from about 1% to about 70% by weight, the balance being
      the other components of the composition such as the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In embodiments, the stabilizer present in the
      silver-containing nanoparticle composition originated from the
      reaction mixture for the preparation of silver-containing
      nanoparticles; no stabilizer is added subsequently for the
      formation of the silver-containing nanoparticles. In other
      embodiments, the same or different stabilizer may be added
      subsequently for the formation of the silver-containing
      nanoparticles in an amount ranging for example from about 0.3% to
      about 70% by weight based on the weight of the silver-containing
      nanoparticle composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The silver-containing nanoparticle composition has a
      stability (that is, the time period where there is minimal
      precipitation or aggregation of the silver-containing
      nanoparticles) of for example at least about 3 hours, or from
      about 3 hours to about 1 month, from about 1 day to about 3
      months, from about 1 day to about 6 months, from about 1 week to
      over 1 year.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The fabrication of an electrically conductive element from
      the silver-containing nanoparticle composition ("composition") can
      be carried out by depositing the composition on a substrate using
      a liquid deposition technique at any suitable time prior to or
      subsequent to the formation of other optional layer or layers on
      the substrate. Thus, liquid deposition of the composition on the
      substrate can occur either on a substrate or on a substrate
      already containing layered material (e.g., a semiconductor layer
      and/or an insulating layer).<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The phrase "liquid deposition technique" refers to
      deposition of a composition using a liquid process such as liquid
      coating or printing, where the liquid is a solution or a
      dispersion. The silver-containing nanoparticle composition may be
      referred to as an ink when printing is used. Illustrative liquid
      coating processes include for example spin coating, blade coating,
      rod coating, dip coating, and the like. Illustrative printing
      techniques include for example lithography or offset printing,
      gravure, flexography, screen printing, stencil printing, inkjet
      printing, stamping (such as microcontact printing), and the like.
      Liquid deposition deposits a layer of the composition having a
      thickness ranging from about 5 nanometers to about 5 millimeters,
      preferably from about 10 nanometers to about 1000 micrometers. The
      deposited silver-containing nanoparticle composition at this stage
      may or may not exhibit appreciable electrical conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] As used herein, the term "heating" encompasses any
      technique(s) that can impart sufficient energy to the heated
      material to cause the desired result such as thermal heating
      (e.g., a hot plate, an oven, and <br>
      a burner), infra-red ("IR") radiation, microwave radiation, or UV
      radiation, or a combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Heating the deposited composition at a temperature of for
      example below about 250[deg.] C., or below about 200[deg.] C. or
      about 150[deg.] C., causes the silver-containing nanoparticles to
      form an electrically conductive layer which is suitable for use as
      an electrically conductive element in electronic devices. The
      heating temperature preferably is one that does not cause adverse
      changes in the properties of previously deposited layer(s) or the
      substrate (whether single layer substrate or multilayer
      substrate). The heating is performed for a time ranging from for
      example about 1 second to about 10 hours, particularly from about
      10 seconds to about 1 hour. The heating is performed in air, in an
      inert atmosphere for example under nitrogen or argon, or in a
      reducing atmosphere for example under nitrogen containing from
      about 1 to about 20 percent by volume hydrogen. The heating is
      performed under normal atmospheric conditions or at a reduced
      pressure of for example from several mbars to about 10&lt;-3 &gt;
      mbar.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Heating produces a number of effects. Prior to heating, the
      layer of the deposited silver-containing nanoparticles may be
      electrically insulating or with very low electrical conductivity,
      but heating results in an electrically conductive layer composed
      of annealed silver-containing nanoparticles which increases the
      conductivity. In embodiments, the annealed silver-containing
      nanoparticles may be coalesced or partially coalesced
      silver-containing nanoparticles. In embodiments, it may be
      possible that in the annealed silver-containing nanoparticles, the
      silver-containing nanoparticles achieve sufficient
      particle-to-particle contact to form the electrically conductive
      layer without coalescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Heating may cause separation of the stabilizer and the
      liquid from the silver-containing nanoparticles in the sense that
      the stabilizer and the liquid are generally not incorporated into
      the electrically conductive layer but if present are in residual
      quantities. In embodiments, heating may decompose a portion of the
      stabilizer to produce "decomposed stabilizer." Heating may also
      cause separation of the decomposed stabilizer such that the
      decomposed stabilizer generally is not incorporated into the
      electrically conductive layer, but if present is in a residual
      amount. Separation of the stabilizer, the liquid, and the
      decomposed stabilizer from the silver-containing nanoparticles may
      lead to enhanced electrical conductivity of the resulting
      electrically conductive layer since the presence of these
      components may reduce the extent of silver-containing nanoparticle
      to silver-containing nanoparticle contact or coalescence.
      Separation may occur in any manner such as for example a change in
      state of matter from a solid or liquid to a gas, e.g.,
      volatilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In embodiments, one or more of the stabilizer, decomposed
      stabilizer, and the liquid is absent from the electrically
      conductive layer. In embodiments, a residual amount of one or more
      of the stabilizer, <br>
      decomposed stabilizer, and the liquid may be present in the
      electrically conductive layer, where the residual amount does not
      appreciably affect the conductivity of the electrically conductive
      layer. In embodiments, the residual amount of one or more of the
      stabilizer, decomposed stabilizer, and the liquid may decrease the
      conductivity of the electrically conductive layer but the
      resulting conductivity is still within the useful range for the
      intended electronic device. The residual amount of each component
      may independently range for example of up to about 5% by weight,
      or less than about 0.5% by weight based on the weight of the
      electrically conductive layer, depending on the process conditions
      such as heating temperature and time. When heating causes
      separation of the stabilizer and/or decomposed stabilizer from the
      silver-containing nanoparticles, the attractive force between the
      separated stabilizer/decomposed stabilizer and the
      silver-containing nanoparticles is severed or diminished. Other
      techniques such as exposure to UV radiation, microwave radiation,
      or IR radiation may be used or combined with thermal heating to
      accelerate the separation of the liquid and the stabilizer (and/or
      the decomposed stabilizer) from the silver-containing
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In embodiments, after heating, the resulting electrically
      conductive layer has a thickness ranging for example from about 5
      nanometers to about 5 millimeters, preferably from about 10
      nanometers to about 1000 micrometers.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The conductivity of the resulting silver-containing element
      produced by heating the deposited silver-containing nanoparticle
      composition is for example more than about 0.1 Siemens/centimeter
      ("S/cm"), more than about 100 S/cm, more than about 500 S/cm, more
      than about 2,000 S/cm, more than about 5,000 S/cm, more than about
      10,000 S/cm, and more than about 20,000 S/cm as measured by
      four-probe method.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The resulting conductive elements can be used as conductive
      electrodes, conductive pads, conductive traces, conductive lines,
      conductive tracks, and the like in electronic devices. The phrase
      "electronic device" refers to macro-, micro- and nano-electronic
      devices such as thin film transistor, organic light emitting
      diodes, RFID tags, photovoltaic, and other electronic devices
      which require conductive elements or components.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In embodiments, the advantages of the present chemical
      method for preparing silver-containing nanoparticles are one or
      more of the following: (i) single phase synthesis (where the
      silver compound, the stabilizer, and the solvent form a single
      phase) without the need for a surfactant; (ii) short reaction
      time; (iii) low reaction temperatures of below about 100[deg.] C.;
      (iv) uniform particle size and narrow particle size distribution;
      (v) stable silver-containing nanoparticle composition which can be
      easily processed by liquid deposition techniques; (vi) relatively
      inexpensive starting materials; and (vii) suitable for large-scale
      production that would significantly lower the cost of
      silver-containing nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In embodiments, the silver-containing nanoparticle
      composition can be used in for example, but not limited to,
      fabricating conductive components such as source and drain
      electrodes in thin film transistor ("TFT").<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In FIG. 1, there is schematically illustrated a TFT
      configuration 10 comprised of a heavily n-doped silicon wafer 18
      which acts as both a substrate and a gate electrode, a thermally
      grown silicon oxide insulating layer 14 on top of which are
      deposited two metal contacts, source electrode 20 and drain
      electrode 22. Over and between the metal contacts 20 and 22 is an
      organic semiconductor layer 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] FIG. 2 schematically illustrates another TFT configuration
      30 comprised of a substrate 36, a gate electrode 38, a source
      electrode 40 and a drain electrode 42, an insulating layer 34, and
      an organic semiconductor layer 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIG. 3 schematically illustrates a further TFT
      configuration 50 comprised of a heavily n-doped silicon wafer 56
      which acts as both a substrate and a gate electrode, a thermally
      grown silicon oxide insulating layer 54, and an organic
      semiconductor layer 52, on top of which are deposited a source
      electrode 60 and a drain electrode 62.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] FIG. 4 schematically illustrates an additional TFT
      configuration 70 comprised of substrate 76, a gate electrode 78, a
      source electrode 80, a drain electrode 82, an organic
      semiconductor layer 72, and an insulating layer 74.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The substrate may be composed of for instance silicon,
      glass plate, plastic film or sheet. For structurally flexible
      devices, plastic substrate, such as for example polyester,
      polycarbonate, polyimide sheets and the like may be used. The
      thickness of the substrate may be from amount 10 micrometers to
      over 10 millimeters with an exemplary thickness being from about
      50 micrometers to about 2 millimeters, especially for a flexible
      plastic substrate and from about 0.4 to about 10 millimeters for a
      rigid substrate such as glass or silicon.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The gate electrode, the source electrode, and the drain
      electrode are fabricated by embodiments of the present invention.
      The thickness of the gate electrode layer ranges for example from
      about 10 to about 2000 nm. Typical thicknesses of source and drain
      electrodes are, for example, from about 40 nm to about 1
      micrometer with the more specific thickness being about 60 to
      about 400 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The insulating layer generally can be an inorganic material
      film or an organic polymer film. Illustrative examples of
      inorganic materials suitable as the insulating layer include
      silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, barium titanate,
      barium zirconium titanate and the like; illustrative examples of
      organic polymers for the insulating layer include polyesters,
      polycarbonates, poly(vinyl phenol), polyimides, polystyrene,
      poly(methacrylate)s, poly(acrylate)s, epoxy resin and the like.
      The thickness of the insulating layer is, for example from about
      10 nm to about 500 nm depending on the dielectric constant of the
      dielectric material used. An exemplary thickness of the insulating
      layer is from about 100 nm to about 500 nm. The insulating layer
      may have a conductivity that is for example less than about
      10&lt;-12 &gt; S/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Situated, for example, between and in contact with the
      insulating layer and the source/drain electrodes is the
      semiconductor layer wherein the thickness of the semiconductor
      layer is generally, for example, about 10 nm to about 1
      micrometer, or about 40 to about 100 nm. Any semiconductor
      material may be used to form this layer. Exemplary semiconductor
      materials include regioregular polythiophene, oligthiophene,
      pentacene, and the semiconductor polymers disclosed in Beng Ong et
      al., U.S. patent application Publication No. US 2003/0160230 A1;
      Beng Ong et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. US
      2003/0160234 A1; Beng Ong et al., U.S. patent application

      Transistors for Large Area Electronics" by C. D. Dimitrakopoulos

      (2002), the disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein
      by reference. Any suitable technique may be used to form the
      semiconductor layer. One such method is to apply a vacuum of about
      10&lt;-5 &gt; to 10&lt;-7 &gt; torr to a chamber containing a
      substrate and a source vessel that holds the compound in powdered
      form. Heat the vessel until the compound sublimes onto the
      substrate. The semiconductor layer can also generally be
      fabricated by solution processes such as spin coating, casting,
      screen printing, stamping, or jet printing of a solution or
      dispersion of the semiconductor.<br>

      [0097] The insulating layer, the gate electrode, the semiconductor
      layer, the source electrode, and the drain electrode are formed in
      any sequence, particularly where in embodiments the gate electrode

      [0098] The invention will now be described in detail with respect
      to specific exemplary embodiments thereof, it being understood
      that these examples are intended to be illustrative only and the
      invention is not intended to be limited to the materials,

      EXAMPLE 1<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Silver acetate (0.167 g, 1 mmol) and 1-dodecylamine (3.71
      g, 20 mmol) were first dissolved in toluene (100 mL) by heating at
      60[deg.] C. until silver acetate was dissolved. To this solution
      was added a solution of phenylhydrazine (0.43 g, 4 mmol) in
      toluene (50 mL) with vigorous stirring over a period of 10 min.
      The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 60[deg.] C. for 1 hr
      before cooling down to room temperature. Subsequently, acetone (10
      mL) was added to the reaction mixture to destroy excess
      phenylhydrazine. Solvent removal from the reaction mixture gave a
      residue which was added to stirring methanol (100 mL) to
      precipitate the crude silver nanoparticle products. The crude
      silver nanoparticle product was isolated by centrifugation, washed
      with acetone twice, and air-dried. It was then dispersed in
      cyclohexane (2 mL) to form a dispersion of silver nanoparticles in
      cyclohexane (with molecules of the 1-dodecylamine stabilizer on
      the surface of the silver nanoparticles). This dispersion was
      suitable for fabricating conductive elements for electronic
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] To form a conductive thin film for conductivity
      measurement, the dispersion of silver nanoparticles in cyclohexane
      (with the 1-dodecylamine stabilizer) was spin-coated on a glass
      substrate to form a brownish thin film. The latter was heated on a
      hot plate at about 120[deg.] C. under ambient conditions, a shiny
      silver film formed immediately upon heating. The thin-film
      conductivity of the resulting silver film was about 23,000 S/cm as
      calculated from the measurements using the conventional four-probe
      technique.<br>

      silver film formed immediately upon heating. The thin-film
      conductivity of the silver film was about 26,000 S/cm as

      was added a solution of benzoic hydrazide (benzoylhydrazine) (0.54
      g, 4 mmol) in toluene (50 mL) with vigorous stirring over a period
      of 10 min. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 60[deg.]

      The thin-film conductivity of the resulting silver film was about
      15,000 S/cm as calculated from the measurements using the
      conventional four-probe technique.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 4<br>
      <br>
      [0105] A bottom-contact thin film transistor, as schematically
      shown by FIG. 1, was chosen to illustrate the use of
      silver-containing nanoparticle composition as the conductive
      electrodes of a thin-film transistor. The experimental device was
      fabricated under ambient conditions, and comprised of an n-doped
      silicon wafer with a thermally grown silicon oxide layer of a
      thickness of about 110 nm thereon. The wafer functioned as the
      gate electrode while the silicon oxide layer acted as the
      insulating layer and had a capacitance of about 30 nF/cm&lt;2 &gt;
      (nanofarads/square centimeter), as measured using a capacitor
      meter. The silicon wafer was first cleaned with oxygen/argon
      plasma, isopropanol, air dried, and then immersed in a 0.1 M
      solution of octyltrichlorosilane in toluene for about 20 min at
      60[deg.] C. Subsequently, the wafer was washed with toluene,
      isopropanol and air-dried.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Stencil printing was used to deposit the silver-containing
      nanoparticle composition on the modified wafer substrate. A
      stainless stencil with a thickness of 13 [mu]m was positioned on
      top of the wafer. A dispersion of silver-containing nanoparticle
      composition of Example 1 in cyclohexane (30 wt %) was then painted
      through the electrode features of the stencil with a fine paint
      brush. After drying at room temperature for 1-5 min, the stencil
      was removed. The printed silver-containing nanoparticle elements
      were heated at 120[deg.] C. on a hotplate under ambient
      conditions. This resulted in the formation of shiny silver
      electrodes. Subsequently, a semiconductor layer was deposited on
      the electroded substrate using the polythiophene semiconductor of
      the following Formula:<br>
      [0107]<br>
      EMI1.0<br>
      <br>
      [0108] where n is a number of from about 5 to about 5,000. This
      polythiophene and its preparation are described in Beng Ong et
      al., U.S. patent application Publication No. US 2003/0160230 A1,
      the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by
      reference. The semiconductor polythiophene layer of about 30 nm to
      about 100 nm in thickness was deposited on top of the device by
      spin coating of the polythiophene in dichlorobenzene solution at a
      speed of 1,000 rpm for about 100 seconds, and dried in vacuo at
      80[deg.] C. for 20 hr, followed by annealing in a vacuum oven at
      120-140[deg.] C. for 10-30 min to induce high structural orders of
      the semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The evaluation of field-effect transistor performance was
      accomplished in a black box at ambient conditions using a Keithley
      4200 SCS semiconductor characterization system. The carrier
      mobility, [mu], was calculated from the data in the saturated
      regime (gate voltage, VG&lt;source-drain voltage, VSD) accordingly
      to equation (1)<br>
      ISD=Ci[mu](W/2L)(VG-VT)&lt;2 &gt; (1)<br>
      where ISD is the drain current at the saturated regime, W and L
      are, respectively, the semiconductor channel width and length, Ci
      is the capacitance per unit area of the insulating layer, and VG
      and VT are, respectively, the gate voltage and threshold voltage.
      VT of the device was determined from the relationship between the
      square root of ISD at the saturated regime and VG of the device by
      extrapolating the measured data to ISD=0. An important property
      for the thin film transistor is its current on/off ratio, which is
      the ratio of the saturation source-drain current in accumulation
      regime over the current in depletion regime.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The inventive device prepared in this manner showed very
      good output and transfer characteristics. The output
      characteristics showed no noticeable contact resistance, very good
      saturation behaviour, clear saturation currents which are
      quadratic to the gate bias. The device turned on at around zero
      gate voltage with a sharp subthreshold slope. Mobility was
      calculated to be 0.08 cm&lt;2&gt; /V.s, and the current on/off
      ratio was about 10&lt;6&gt; -10&lt;7&gt; . The performance of the
      inventive device was essentially the same as that of a
      conventional bottom-contact TFT with vacuum deposited silver
      electrodes.<br>

      Abstract --- To obtain a silver nanoparticle powder suitable for a
      wiring material for forming a fine circuit pattern, particularly
      for a wiring formation material through inkjet method. The silver
      nanopowder has an average particle size (DTEM) below 30 nm, aspect
      ratio below 1.5, crystal particle diameter (Dx) by X ray under 30
      nm, single crystalline degree [(DTEM)]/(Dx) under 5.0, and CV
      value [=100 x standard deviation (sigma)/number average particle
      size [(DTEM)] under 40%, measured by TEM observation, the surface
      of the powder being covered with an organic protective agent with
      molecular weight 100 to 400. The nanopowder is obtained by
      reducing silver salt at temperature of 85 to 150 DEG C in the
      co-existence of the organic protective agent within the alcohol of
      boiling point 85 to 150 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a particulate powder of silver,
      particularly to a nanoparticle powder of silver that is a suitable
      material for forming interconnects of fine circuit patterns,
      especially for forming interconnects by the ink-jet method, and a
      method of manufacturing the powder. The particulate powder of
      silver of the present invention is a suitable material for forming
      interconnects on LSI substrates, and electrodes and interconnects
      of flat panel displays (FPDs), and for filling in fine trenches,
      via holes and contact holes. It is also suitable for use as a
      coloring material for automobile paints and the like. Moreover,
      its low impurity and toxicity levels make it useful as a carrier
      for adsorbing biochemical substances and the like in the fields of
      medical treatment, diagnostics and biotechnology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      When the size of solid substance particles reaches the ultrafine
      nanometer order (called "nanoparticles" in the following), the
      specific surface area of the particles becomes very great, so
      that, even though they are solids, their interface with a gas or
      liquid becomes extremely large. Their surface characteristics
      therefore strongly affect the properties of the solid substance.<br>
      It is known that the melting point of metal nanoparticles is
      dramatically reduced from that in the bulk state. In comparison
      with conventional micrometer-order particles, therefore, metal
      nanoparticles offer not only fine interconnect formation
      capability but also other features such as low-temperature sinter
      capability. Owing to the low resistance and excellent
      weatherability of silver nanoparticles, and also their low price
      compared with other noble metal nanoparticles, silver
      nanoparticles are seen as metal nanoparticles with particular
      promise as the next-generation material for fine interconnects.<br>
      <br>
      Known methods of manufacturing nanometer-order particles
      (nanoparticles) of silver are broadly divided into vapor phase
      methods and liquid phase methods. Vapor phase methods are
      ordinarily methods that conduct deposition in a gas. Patent
      Document 1 describes a method of vaporizing silver in a helium or
      other inert gas atmosphere, under a reduced pressure of around 0.5
      torr. Patent Document 2 teaches a liquid phase method for
      obtaining a silver colloid by reducing silver ions in an aqueous
      phase using an amine and transferring the obtained silver
      deposition phase to an organic solvent phase (polymeric
      dispersant). Patent Document 3 describes a method in which a
      reducing agent (alkali metal borohydride or ammonium borohydride)
      is used to reduce a silver halide in a solvent in the presence of
      a thiol type protective agent.<br>

      Patent Document 1: JP 2001-35255A<br>
      Patent Document 2: JP 11-319538 A<br>
      Patent Document 3: JP 2003-253311A<br>
      <br>
      <b>Problems to be Overcome by the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The silver particles obtained by the vapor phase method of Patent
      Document 1 are 10 nm or less in diameter and have good
      dispersibility in solvent. However, the technology requires a
      special apparatus. This makes it difficult to synthesize large
      quantities of silver nanoparticles for industrial use. In
      contrast, the liquid phase method is basically suitable for
      large-volume synthesis but has a problem in that the metal
      nanoparticles in the liquid have a strong tendency to agglomerate,
      making it difficult to obtain a monodispersed nanoparticle powder.
      In most cases, citric acid is used as the dispersant when
      manufacturing metal nanoparticles, and the metal ion concentration
      in the liquid is usually very low as 10 mmole/L (0.01 mole/L) or
      lower. This is a barrier to its industrial application.<br>
      <br>
      Although the foregoing method of Patent Document 2 achieves
      synthesis of stably dispersed silver nanoparticles by using a high
      metal ion concentration of 0.1 mole/L or greater and a high
      reaction mixture concentration, it suppresses agglomeration by
      using a polymeric dispersant having a high number average
      molecular weight of several tens of thousands. The use of a
      dispersant of high molecular weight is not a problem when the
      silver nanoparticles are to be used as a coloring material, but
      when the particles are to be used in circuit fabrication
      applications, a firing temperature that is equal to or higher than
      the polymer boiling point is required and, in addition, pores
      readily form in the interconnects after the firing, so that
      problems of high resistance and breakage arise, making the
      particles not altogether suitable for fine interconnect
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing method of Patent Document 3 conducts the reaction at
      a relatively high reactant concentration of 0.1 mole/L or greater
      and disperses the obtained silver particles of 10 nm or less using
      a dispersant. As a suitable dispersant, Patent Document 3 proposes
      a thiol type dispersant, which can be readily vaporized by
      low-temperature firing at the time of interconnect formation
      because it has a low molecular weight of around 200. However, the
      thiol type surfactant contains sulfur (S), and sulfur causes
      corrosion of interconnects and other electronic components, making
      it an unsuitable element for interconnect formation applications.
      The method is therefore not suitable for interconnect formation
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, an object of the present invention is to overcome such
      problems by providing a nanoparticle powder of silver suitable for
      fine interconnect formation applications, and a liquid dispersion
      thereof, at low cost and in large quantities. Moreover, since
      monodispersion of spherical silver nanoparticles of uniform
      diameter is preferable, another object is to provide a liquid
      dispersion of such silver particles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Means for Solving the Problems</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In accordance with, the present invention, which was accomplished
      for achieving the foregoing objects, there is provided a
      particulate powder of silver having an average particle diameter
      measured by TEM observation (DTEM) of 30 nm or less, an aspect
      ratio of less than 1.5, an X-ray crystallite size (Dx) of 30 nm or
      less, a degree of single crystal grain {(DTEM)/(Dx)} of 5.0 or
      less, and a CV value {100*standard deviation ([sigma])/number
      average diameter (DTEM)} of less than 40%, which particulate
      powder of silver has adhered to the surface of the particles
      thereof an organic protective agent (typically an amino compound,
      particularly a primary amine) having a molecular weight of 100 to
      400. The present invention further provides a liquid dispersion of
      silver particles obtained by dispersing such particulate powder of
      silver in an organic solvent, which liquid dispersion of silver
      particles has an average particle diameter (D50) measured by the
      dynamic light-scattering method of 100 nm or less and a degree of
      dispersion {(D50)/(DTEM)} of 5.0 or less. As can be seen in the
      photograph of FIG. 1, the silver particles of the present
      invention are spheres of uniform diameter. In a liquid dispersion,
      they are monodispersed with the individual particles spaced at
      regular intervals. Further, as a method of manufacturing such a
      particulate powder of silver, the present invention provides a
      method of manufacturing a particulate powder of silver coated with
      an organic protective agent, wherein a silver salt (typically
      silver nitrate) is subjected to reduction treatment at a
      temperature of 85 to 150[deg.] C. in an alcohol having a boiling
      point of 85 to 150[deg.] C. and in the co-presence of an organic
      protective agent (typically an amino compound, particularly a
      primary amine, having a molecular weight of 100 to 400). The
      alcohol is desirably one or a mixture of two or more of
      isobutanol, n-butanol, s-butanol, and t-butanol.<br>

      </b><br>
      <img alt="" src="us777.jpg" height="704" width="405"><br>
      <br>
      The present inventor conducted numerous experiments to manufacture
      nanoparticle powder of silver by the liquid phase method and found
      it was possible to obtain a powder composed of spherical silver
      nanoparticles of uniform particle diameter by subjecting a silver
      salt to reduction treatment at a temperature of 85 to 150[deg.] C.
      in an alcohol having a boiling point of 85 to 150[deg.] C. (while
      refluxing vaporized alcohol to the liquid phase) and in the
      co-presence of an amino compound having a molecular weight of 100
      to 400. This nanoparticle powder of silver disperses well in a
      dispersant because it is in a condition of having the organic
      protective agent adhered to its surface. It is therefore a
      suitable material for forming interconnects of fine circuit
      patterns, especially for forming interconnects by the ink-jet
      method. The characteristic features of the invention particulate
      silver powder are explained individually below.<br>
      <br>
      TEM Particle Diameter (DTEM)<br>
      <br>
      The average particle diameter (DTEM) of the invention silver
      particles measured by TEM (transmission electron microscope)
      observation is 30 nm or less. It is determined by measuring the
      diameters of 300 discrete, non-overlapping particles observed in a
      600000*TEM image and calculating the average thereof. The aspect
      ratio and CV value are determined from the same observational
      results.<br>
      <br>
      Aspect Ratio<br>
      <br>
      The aspect ratio (ratio of long diameter/short diameter) of the
      particulate silver powder of this invention is less than 1.5,
      preferably less than 1.2, and more preferably less than 1.1. The
      particles in the photograph of FIG. 1 are substantially spherical
      and have an (average) aspect ratio of less than 1.05. They are
      therefore ideal for interconnect formation applications. If the
      aspect ratio exceeds 1.5, particle packing is degraded when the
      particle liquid dispersion is applied to a substrate and dried,
      which may cause pores to occur during firing, increasing the
      resistance and possibly giving rise to interconnect breakage.<br>
      <br>
      CV Value<br>
      <br>
      The CV value is an index of particle diameter variation; a smaller
      CV value indicates more uniform particle diameter. CV value is
      expressed as: CV value=100*standard deviation ([sigma])/number
      average diameter. The CV value of the particulate silver powder of
      the present invention is less than 40%, preferably less than 25%,
      more preferably 15%. A nanoparticle silver powder having a CV
      value of less than 40% is ideal for interconnect applications. If
      the CV value is 40% or greater, then, similarly to the foregoing,
      particle packing is inferior, so that pores occurring during
      firing may increase the resistance and give rise to interconnect
      breakage.<br>
      <br>
      X-Ray Crystallite Size (Dx)<br>
      <br>
      The crystallite size of the silver nanoparticles of this invention
      is less than 30 nm. The Scherrer relationship can be used to find
      the crystallite size of the particulate silver powder from the
      results of x-ray diffraction measurement. In this specification,
      the crystallite size is therefore called the X-ray crystallite
      size (Dx). It is determined as follows.<br>
      <br>
      The Scherrer relationship is expressed by the general equation:<br>
      D=K.[lambda]/[beta] Cos [theta],<br>
      <br>
      where K is Scherrer constant, D is crystallite size, [lambda] is
      wavelength of the x-ray used for the measurement, [beta] is
      half-value width of the x-ray diffraction peak, and [theta] is
      Bragg angle of the diffraction line.<br>
      If 0.94 is used as the value of K and a Cu X-ray tube is used, the
      equation can be rewritten as:<br>
      D=0.94*1.5405/[beta] Cos [theta].<br>
      <br>
      Degree of Single Crystal Grain<br>
      <br>
      Degree of single crystal grain is represented by the ratio of TEM
      particle diameter to X-ray crystallite size {(DTEM)/(Dx)}. The
      degree of single crystal grain approximately corresponds to the
      number of crystals per particle. The higher the value of the
      degree of single crystal grain, the greater is the number of
      crystallites, which called the particle to be composed of multiple
      crystals. The degree of single crystal grain of the invention
      silver particles is 5.0 or less, preferably 3.0 or less, more
      preferably 1.0 or less. Grain boundaries within the particles are
      therefore few. Electrical resistance rises with increasing number
      of grain boundaries present. In the invention particulate silver
      powder, the value of the degree of single crystal grain is low,
      which gives it low resistance and makes it suitable for use in
      conductors.<br>

      <b>Average Particle Diameter by the Dynamic Light-Scattering
        Method</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention liquid dispersion obtained by mixing the particulate
      silver powder and the organic solvent has an average particle
      diameter (D50) by the dynamic light-scattering method of 60 nm or
      less and the degree of dispersion {(D50)/(DTEM)} is 5.0 or less.
      The silver particles of this invention readily disperse in the
      organic solvent (dispersion medium) and can remain in a stable
      dispersed state in the dispersion medium. The dynamic
      light-scattering method can be used to assess the state of
      dispersion of the silver particles in the dispersion medium, and
      also to calculate the average particle diameter. The principle of
      the method is as follows. In a liquid, the translational,
      rotational and other forms of Brownian movement of particles
      having a diameter in the range of around 1 nm to 5 [mu]m
      ordinarily changes the location and orientation of the particles
      from instant to instant. When a laser beam is projected onto the
      particles and the scattered light that emerges is detected, there
      are observed fluctuations in the scattered light intensity that
      are attributable to the Brownian movement. By measuring the time
      dependence of the scattered light intensity, it is possible to
      determine the velocity of the Brownian movement (diffusion
      coefficient) of the particles and also to learn the size of the
      particles. If the average diameter of the particles in the
      dispersion medium measured utilizing this principle is close to
      the average particle diameter obtained by TEM observation, this
      means that the particles in the liquid are individually dispersed
      (not attached to each other or agglomerated). In other words, the
      particles in the dispersion medium are spaced apart from each
      other and thus in a state that enables them to move independently.
      The average particle diameter of the nanoparticle silver powder in
      the invention liquid dispersion determined by carrying out the
      dynamic light-scattering method thereon is on a level not much
      different from the average particle diameter found by TEM
      observation. More specifically, the average particle diameter of
      the invention liquid dispersion measured by the dynamic
      light-scattering method is 60 nm or less, preferably 30 nm or
      less, and more preferably 20 nm or less, which is not very
      different from the average particle diameter by TEM observation.
      This means that a monodispersed state is achieved and indicates
      that the present invention is capable of providing a liquid
      dispersion in which the nanoparticles of the silver powder are
      independently dispersed. Still, even when the particles are
      completely monodispersed in the dispersion medium, cases arise in
      which measurement error or the like causes differences to arise
      with respect to the average particle diameter obtained by TEM
      observation. For example, the concentration of the liquid
      dispersion during the measurement must be suitable for the
      performance and the scattered light detection system of the
      measurement apparatus, and errors occur if the concentration does
      not ensure transmission of enough light. Moreover, the signal
      obtained when measuring nanometer-order particles is so feeble
      that contaminants and dust come to have a strong effect that may
      cause errors. Care is therefore necessary regarding pretreatment
      of samples and the cleanliness of the measurement environment. The
      laser beam source used for nanometer-order particle measurement
      should have an output power of 100 mW or greater so as to ensure
      adequate scattered light intensity. In addition, it is known that
      when the dispersion medium is adsorbed on the particles, the
      adsorbed dispersion medium layer has an effect that works to
      increase particle diameter even when the particles are completely
      dispersed. This effect becomes particularly manifest when particle
      diameter falls below 10 nm. So it can be assumed that good
      dispersion is maintained even if the dispersed particles do not
      have exactly the same degree of dispersion as the value found by
      the TEM observation, provided that the degree of dispersion
      (D50)/(DTEM) is 5.0 or less, preferably 3.0 or less.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Manufacturing Method</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The particulate silver powder of the present invention can be
      manufactured by subjecting a silver salt to reduction treatment at
      a temperature of 85 to 150[deg.] C. in an alcohol having a boiling
      point of 85 to 150[deg.] C. and in the co-presence of an organic
      protective agent. The alcohol used in the present invention as a
      solvent/reducing agent is required to have a boiling point of 85
      to 150[deg.] C. but is not otherwise particularly limited. An
      alcohol having a boiling point below 85[deg.] C. does not readily
      enable a reaction temperature of 85[deg.] C. or higher without
      using a special reactor such as an autoclave. Preferred alcohols
      include one or a mixture of two or more of isobutanol, n-butanol,
      s-butanol, and t-butanol. A silver salt is used that is soluble in
      alcohol. Silver nitrate is preferable from the viewpoint of low
      price and security of supply. As the organic protective agent,
      there is preferably used a metal coordination compound of a
      molecular weight of 100 to 400 that has coordinating capability
      towards silver. Use of a compound having no or only weak
      coordinating capability toward silver is undesirable from the
      viewpoint of practicability, because a large amount of protective
      agent would be needed to produce silver nanoparticles of 30 nm or
      smaller. An amino compound is suitable as the organic protective
      agent constituted of a metal coordination compound. Viewed
      generally, metal coordination compounds include isonitrile
      compounds, sulfur compounds, amino compounds, and fatty acids
      having a carboxyl group. However, a sulfur compound would degrade
      the reliability of electronic components because it would cause
      corrosion owing to the sulfur it contains. When silver nitrate is
      the starting material, a fatty acid or the like generates fatty
      acid silver and isonitrile compounds are problematic because they
      are toxic. This invention uses an amino compound having a
      molecular weight of 100 to 400 as the organic protective agent.
      Among amino compounds, a primary amine is preferable. A secondary
      amine or tertiary amine would itself operate as a reducing agent,
      which would cause an inconvenience in a case where an alcohol is
      already in use as a reducing agent, because the resulting presence
      of two types of reducing agent would complicate control of the
      reduction rate and the like. An amino compound having a molecular
      weight of less than 100 has low agglomeration suppressing effect.
      One with a molecular weight exceeding 400 has strong agglomeration
      suppressing effect but also has a high boiling point. If a
      particulate powder of silver whose particle surfaces are coated
      therewith should be used as a material for forming interconnects,
      the amino compound would act as a sinter inhibitor during firing.
      The resistance of the interconnects would therefore become high,
      possibly to the point of impairing conductivity. Since this is
      undesirable, it is best to use an amino compound having a
      molecular weight of 100-400.<br>
      <br>
      At a reaction temperature under 85[deg.] C., the silver
      nanoparticle yield is extremely low. On the other hand, a reaction
      temperature exceeding 150[deg.] C. is undesirable because no
      additional yield improvement is observed but coarsening of the
      silver particles by sintering becomes pronounced. The reduction of
      the silver ions by alcohol is therefore best conducted with the
      temperature maintained between 85 and 150[deg.] C., but with the
      reaction being carried out while using an apparatus equipped with
      a reflux condenser to return vaporized alcohol to the liquid
      phase. The silver salt concentration of the reaction mixture is
      preferably made 50 mmole/L or greater. A lower concentration than
      this increases cost and is therefore not suitable from the
      industrial viewpoint. Upon completion of the reaction, the slurry
      obtained is centrifuged to separate solid from liquid. The
      resulting sediment is added with a dispersion medium such as
      ethanol and dispersed therein using an ultrasonic disperser. The
      dispersion is again centrifuged and the sediment is again added
      with ethanol and dispersed with the ultrasonic disperser. This
      process of [solid-liquid separation-&gt;dispersion] is repeated
      three times, whereafter the supernatant is discarded and the
      sediment dried to obtain the particulate powder of silver of the
      present invention. As the dispersion medium (organic solvent) for
      dispersing the invention particulate silver powder can be used an
      ordinary non-polar solvent or a low-polarity solvent such as
      hexane, toluene, kerosene, decane, dodecane or tetradecane. The
      liquid dispersion obtained is then centrifuged to remove coarse
      particles and agglomerated particles. Next, only the supernatant
      is collected as a sample to be subjected to TEM, x-ray, particle
      size distribution and other measurements. The nanoparticle powder
      obtained is dried in a vacuum drier (for 12 hours at 200[deg.] C.,
      for example), whereafter the dry product can be assayed for silver
      purity using the gravimetric method (upon dissolution in nitric
      acid followed by addition of HCl to prepare a silver chloride
      precipitate) to measure purity from the weight thereof. The purity
      of the particulate powder of silver of the present invention is
      95% or greater.<br>

      <b>WORKING EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Isobutanol (reagent grade from of Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
      Ltd.), 200 mL, used as a solvent/reducing agent, was added with
      132.74 mL of oleyl amine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and
      13.727 g of silver nitrate crystal, and the mixture was stirred
      with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature to dissolve the silver
      nitrate. The solution was transferred to a container equipped with
      a reflux condenser which was then placed in an oil bath. The
      solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm and heated
      while nitrogen gas used as an inert gas was blown into the
      container at the rate of 400 mL/min. Refluxing was continued for 5
      hours at 100[deg.] C. to complete the reaction. The temperature
      increase rate to 100[deg.] C. was 2[deg.] C./min. After the
      reaction, the slurry was subjected to solid-liquid separation and
      washing by the procedure set out below:<br>
      <br>
      1. The slurry following the reaction was centrifuged at 5000 rpm
      for 60 minutes in a CF7D2 centrifuge made by Hitachi Koki Co.,
      Ltd. to separate solid from liquid, and the supernatant was
      discarded.<br>
      <br>
      2. The sediment was added with ethanol and dispersed using an
      ultrasonic disperser.<br>
      <br>
      3. Steps 1 and 2 were repeated 3 times.<br>
      <br>
      4. Step 1 was performed and the supernatant was discarded to
      obtain a sediment.<br>
      <br>
      The pasty sediment obtained in Step 4 was prepared for evaluation
      as follows:<br>
      <br>
      a) For the measurement of particle size distribution by TEM
      observation and dynamic light-scattering, the sediment was added
      with and dispersed in kerosene, the liquid dispersion was
      centrifuged to sediment coarse particles and agglomerated
      particles, and the sediment was removed to obtain a liquid
      dispersion. Evaluation was carried out on the liquid dispersion .<br>
      <br>
      b) For the x-ray diffraction and crystallite size measurement, the
      liquid dispersion removed of coarse particles and agglomerated
      particles prepared in a) was concentrated to a paste that was
      coated onto a non-reflective substrate and analyzed with an x-ray
      diffractometer.<br>
      <br>
      c) For determining Ag purity and yield, the sediment was dried in
      a vacuum drier for 12 hours at 200[deg.] C. and the weight of the
      dried product was measured. More specifically, the Ag purity of
      the dried product was measured by the gravimetric method (method
      of dissolving the dried product in nitric acid, adding HCl to the
      solution to prepare a silver chloride precipitate, and measuring
      the purity from the weight thereof). Yield was calculated as
      {(dried product actually obtained after reaction)/(silver amount
      calculated from added silver nitrate)}*100(%) per batch.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the measurements were TEM average particle
      diameter: 6.6 nm, aspect ratio: 1.1, CV value: 10.5%, crystallite
      size (Dx): 8.7 nm, and degree of single crystal grain (DTEM/Dx):
      0.76. Only peaks attributable to silver were observed in the x-ray
      diffraction results. D50 measured by the dynamic light-scattering
      method (Microtrack UPA) was 26.6 nm. D50/DTEM was 4.0. Silver
      purity was 96.8% and silver yield was 93.1%.<br>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 are TEM photographs of the nanoparticle silver
      powder of this Example (photographs for determining TEM average
      particle diameter and the like). In these photographs, spherical
      silver nanoparticles are observed to be well dispersed at regular
      intervals. Although a very small number of overlapped particles
      are observed, the measurements of average particle diameter
      (DTEM), aspect ratio and CV value were made with respect to
      completely dispersed particles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that propanol was used as the
      solvent/reducing agent and the reaction temperature was made
      80[deg.] C. The results showed the silver yield to be a very low
      1.1%, and while only peaks attributable to silver were observed in
      the sediment by x-ray diffraction, Dx was 15.9 nm. Measurements
      other than the x-ray diffraction analysis were impossible to carry
      out because the amount of sample was too small.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that ethanol was used as the
      solvent/reducing agent and the reaction temperature was made
      75[deg.] C. The results showed the silver yield to be a very low
      0.9%, and while only peaks attributable to silver were observed in
      the sediment by x-ray diffraction, Dx was 25.4 nm. Measurements
      other than the x-ray diffraction analysis were impossible to carry
      out because the amount of sample was too small.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from the Comparative Examples, silver yield was
      extremely low and productivity poor both when using an alcohol
      having a boiling point of 85[deg.] C. or lower and when making the
      reaction temperature lower than 80[deg.] C.<br>

      a solvent and silver nanoparticles. Because it contains an organic
      component as described above, even at high content of silver, the
      silver nanoparticles of the present invention may exhibit high
      dispersion stability to solvents, and a solubilized state. As the
      solvent, for example, addition of the terpene solvent, it is
      possible to use an organic solvent such as acetone, benzene,

      <br>
      [0031] Further, the present invention can also be used as a paste
      by mixing a paste of agents known.<br>
      <br>

      for example, suitably conductive circuit-forming composition, the
      decorative layer forming composition, as the plating replacement
      composition or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In particular, a coating film forming composition is also
      suitable as an ink for screen printing is used, the inkjet method
      or the like. In particular, the composition can be suitably used
      as an inkjet ink. Especially, the film-forming aqueous composition
      using an aqueous solvent as the solvent is advantageous. The
      film-forming aqueous composition of 1) the present invention, that
      the high surface tension with water is suitable for injection of a
      small amount of ink, a solvent-based ink 2) Conventionally, the

      whereas degraded by a solvent, the film-forming aqueous
      composition of the present invention, points etc. can avoid
      problems caused by such solvents, and the like. Thus, it can be
      used as an ink (water-based compositions, particularly) the
      composition to form a coating preferably on a substrate by an ink
      jet printer.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] When used as a plating alternative compositions of the
      present invention composition, for example, to form a coating film
      formed from the plating alternative composition for the portion
      for forming a film, it is forcibly dried or air-dried as necessary
      By, followed by heat treatment at 50 ~ 350 ℃ about atmosphere, it

      method according to the conventional (wet plating method). That
      is, in the present invention compositions, it is possible without
      passing through the wet plating method, is formed in an
      environment dry metallization equivalent to (film) plating. Thus,
      it is possible to avoid waste water treatment by wet plating,
      safety issues, and the like. Further, the wet plating methods such
      as electroless plating and electroplating, and while being carried
      by immersing the workpiece all the plating solution strongly
      alkaline or strongly acidic, in the case of using the plating
      alternative composition it is possible to form a film only the
      desired area. Further, in the case of forming a metal film by the
      present invention compositions, it is possible to obtain a film
      exhibiting metallic luster gold, silver, blue silver, etc. just to
      dry the coating. Therefore, the present invention composition can
      be suitably used a surface decoration (surface modification).<br>

      the like using silver nanoparticles, after forming on the
      substrate a predetermined circuit pattern by using, for example, a
      film-forming composition exemplified above, it may be

      to be a feature of the present invention. However, the present
      invention is not limited to the scope of the examples.<br>

      </b><b> Abstract </b>--- The invention provides new types of
      plasmon-driven growth mechanism for silver nanostructures
      involving the fusion of triangular nanoprisms. This mechanism,
      which is plasmon excitation-driven and highly cooperative,
      produces bimodal particle size distributions. In these methods,
      the growth process can be selectively switched between bimodal and
      unimodal distributions using dual beam illumination of the
      nanoparticles. This type of cooperative photo-control over
      nanostructure growth enables synthesis of monodisperse nanoprisms
      with a preselected edge length in the 30-120 nm range simply by
      using one beam to turn off bimodal growth and the other (varied
      over the 450-700 nm range) for controlling particle size.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The invention resides in the field of nanoparticles and
      specifically in methods of forming silver nanoprisms of varying
      sizes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Nanoclusters are an important class of materials that are
      having a major impact in a diverse range of applications,
      including chem- and biodetection, catalysis, optics, and data
      storage. The use of such particles dates back to the middle ages,
      and the scientific study of them has spanned over a century. These
      nanostructures are typically made from molecular precursors, and
      there are now a wide variety of compositions, sizes, and even
      shapes available. Because of their unusual and potentially useful
      optical properties, nanoprism structures in particular have been a
      recent synthetic target of many research groups. We recently
      reported a high yield photosynthetic method for the preparation of
      triangular nanoprisms from silver nanospheres. For many
      nanoparticle syntheses, an Ostwald ripening mechanism, where large
      clusters grow at the expense of smaller ones, is used to describe
      and model the growth processes. This type of ripening typically
      results in unimodal particle growth. Thus, method of controlling
      the growth and ultimate dimensions of such structures is desired.
      Such a method will necessarily fall outside of the known Ostwald
      ripening mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The present invention provides a method of forming
      nanoprisms by exposing silver particles to a wavelength of light
      between about 400 nm and about 700 nm for a period of less than
      about 60 hours. The nanoprisms formed have a bimodal size
      distribution. Preferably, the silver particles are present in a
      colloid containing a reducing agent, a stabilizing agent and a
      surfactant. If the colloid contains a stabilizing agent and a
      surfactant, the ratio of the stabilizing agent to the surfactant
      is preferably about 0.3:1. The nanoparticle starting materials
      have a diameter between 0.2 nm and about 15 nm. The nanoprisms
      formed are single crystalline and have a {111} crystal face on a
      base plane of the nanoprism and a {110} crystal face on a side
      plane of the nanoprism and display plasmon bands having
      [lambda]max at 640 nm and 1065 nm, 340 nm and 470 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another embodiment of the present invention provides a
      method of forming a nanoprism by exposing silver nanoparticles to
      a primary and a secondary wavelength of light such that one of the
      primary and secondary wavelengths of light excites quadrupole
      plasmon resonance in the silver particles. In this embodiment, one
      of the primary and secondary wavelengths of light coincides with
      the out-of-plane quadrupole resonances of the silver nanoprisms.
      In a preferred embodiment of this method, the secondary wavelength
      of light is about 340 nm and the primary wavelength of light is in
      the range of about 450 nm and about 700 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] By adjusting the primary wavelength of light used in these
      embodiments of the present invention, the edge length of the
      nanoprisms produced can be controlled. When the secondary
      wavelength of light is about 340 nm and the primary wavelength of
      light is in the range of about 450 nm and about 700 nm, the
      nanoprisms produced have an edge length of between about 31 nm and
      about 45 nm. Alternatively, if the primary wavelength of light is
      in the range of about 470 nm and about 510 nm, the nanoprisms have
      an edge length between about 53 nm and about 57 nm. Alternatively,
      if the primary wavelength of light is in the range of about 500 nm
      and about 540 nm, the nanoprisms have an edge length between about
      53 nm and about 71 nm. Alternatively, if the primary wavelength of
      light is in the range of about 530 nm and about 570 nm, the
      nanoprisms have an edge length between about 64 nm and about 80
      nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Alternatively, if the primary wavelength of light is in the
      range of about 580 nm and about 620 nm, the nanoprisms have an
      edge length between about 84 nm and about 106 nm. Alternatively,
      if the primary wavelength of light is in the range of about 650 nm
      and about 690 nm, the nanoprisms have an edge length between about
      106 nm and about 134 nm.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] The invention provides a method of controlling the growth
      and size of nanoprisms formed from a metal colloid by excitation
      of surface plasmons. This method provides control over
      nanoparticle growth allowing the synthesis of monodisperse samples
      of nanoprisms having a desired edge length simply by controlling
      the excitation wavelength of a narrow band light source. Exposure
      to a light source having the correct excitation wavelength causes
      plasmon excitation on the surface of the metal nanoparticles. When
      a single beam (e.g. 550+/-20 nm) was used, it has been
      surprisingly found that the suspension of nanoprisms formed
      consists of two different size distributions, of which the smaller
      (designated as Type 1) and the larger nanoprisms (designated Type
      2) have average edge lengths in the range of about 55 nm to about
      85 nm and about 130 nm to about 170 nm, respectively (FIG. 1A).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] These nanoprisms form stacks, and therefore, edge views
      allow precise determination of the nanoprism thickness (FIG.
      1B-C). Although the average edge lengths for the Type 1 and Type 2
      nanoprisms are significantly different, their thicknesses are
      almost identical between about 8 nm and about 11 nm. Both types of
      nanoprisms are single crystalline with face-centered cubic (fcc)
      structures. The {111} crystal face forms the top/base plane of the
      nanoprism, and three {110} crystal faces form the side planes.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] During the formation reaction, the plasmon band at
      approximately 395 nm associated with the spherical silver
      particles disappears while two new strong bands having [lambda]max
      at 640 nm and 1065 nm associated with the Type 1 and Type 2
      nanoprisms, respectively, appear. The band for the Type 1 prisms
      is initially centered at [lambda]max=680 nm and gradually blue
      shifts to [lambda]max=640 nm. This blue shifting correlates with
      the tip sharpness of the nanoprism features as rounding is known
      to lead to blue-shifting. The second strong band at
      [lambda]max=1065 nm is assigned to Type 2 particles. As shown by
      curve 6 in FIG. 2A, two other weak resonances having [lambda]max
      at 340 nm and 470 nm are observed in addition to the two strong
      surface plasmon bands.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Theoretical modeling using a finite element-based method
      known as the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) shows plasmon
      bands that reproduce the experimentally observed spectrum. For
      example, by comparing FIG. 2(B) and curve 6 of FIG. 2(A),
      unambiguous peak assignments can be provided. The first three
      peaks in the spectrum of the colloid containing both Type 1 and
      Type 2 particles, 340 nm (out-of-plane quadrupole resonance), 470
      nm (in-plane quadrupole resonance) and 640 nm (in-plane dipole
      resonance), result from the Type 1 nanoprisms. In the case of the
      Type 2 nanoprisms, only the strong dipole resonance at 1065 nm is
      clearly observed. FIG. 2(B) shows that quadrupole resonances,
      which occur at 340 nm and 600 nm in the solution of the Type 2
      nanoprisms, are overlapped with plasmon bands from the Type 1
      nanoprisms. These time-dependent optical spectra are consistent
      with a bimodal process rather than the unimodal growth processes
      expected for the conventional Ostwald ripening of the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The nanoprisms are composed of silver present in the silver
      colloid starting material. Any silver salt can be used to form the
      silver nanoparticles. Preferably, the silver salt is AgNO3,
      CH3CO2Ag, AgClO4, Ag2SO4 or combinations of these silver salts.
      The silver nanoparticles used to obtain the silver nanoprisms are
      less than about 15 nm in diameter and preferably less than about
      10 nm in diameter. More preferably, the silver nanoparticles are
      between about 2 nm and about 6 nm in diameter. Most preferably,
      the silver nanoparticles are about 4.8 nm in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The colloidal silver suspension that forms the starting
      material can be formed by any means to contain silver
      nanoparticles falling within the desired size range. Many methods
      of forming a silver colloid are known in the art and generally all
      include different forms of agitation to produce the colloidal
      particles. The colloidal suspension may also include other
      chemicals that do not participate in the reaction forming the
      nanoprisms. For example, reducing agents, suspending agents,
      surface acting agents, particle stabilizing agents and the like
      can be used in formation of the suspension without adversely
      affecting the formation of the nanoprisims in the methods of the
      present invention. The colloid can be easily prepared using the
      methods described by Cao et al. (Cao, Y. W.; Jin, R.; Mirkin, C.
      A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 7961 (2001)) which includes vigorous
      stirring in the presence of sodium borohydride followed by the
      addition of Bis (p-sulfonatophenyl) phenylphosphine dihydrate
      dipotassium (BSPP) and additional stirring. Surfactants used to
      form the suspension of nanospheres may vary widely in
      concentration without affecting the extent of the conversion of
      nanospheres to nanoprisms. However, the reaction rate is affected
      by surfactant and provides an additional means of controlling the
      conversion reaction based on the conversion rate. Preferably,
      trisodium citrate is present as a surfactant in the suspension of
      silver nanospheres and bis(p-sulfonatophenyl) phenylphosphine
      dihydrate (BSPP) is added to the suspension as a particle
      stabilizing agent. Although the nanoprisms are formed over the
      entire range of surfactant concentration, the rate of the
      conversion reaction decreases as a function of increasing the
      ratio of BSPP to citrate over a range of about 0.01 to about 1.
      The most rapid conversion rate is obtained at a BSPP to citrate
      ratio of 0.3:1. Thus, the reaction rate may be optimized by
      varying the surfactant concentration and the ratio of the
      surfactant to a stabilizing agent added to the suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The light source used to produce the nanoprisms having a
      bimodal size distribution must possess a wavelength that generates
      the plasmon excitation resulting in nanoprism formation and
      growth. The excitation wavelength is between about 400 nm and
      about 700 nm. Preferably the excitation wavelength is between
      about 530 nm and 570 nm. More preferably, the excitation
      wavelength is about 550 nm. However, the bimodal growth of the
      nanoprisms is not caused by the wavelength dispersity of the
      excitation beam. For example, when a monochromatic laser beam
      having a wavelength of 532.8 nm (the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG
      laser) is used to photolyze the silver colloids, bimodal growth is
      still observed. Preferably, a narrow band light source is used to
      irradiate the silver colloid. A 150 watt xenon lamp having a light
      output of about 12 watts with an optical bandpass filter having a
      center wavelength of 550 nm and a width of 40 nm is suitable for
      use in the methods of the present invention although one of skill
      in he art will recognize that many suitable light sources
      producing a light having a wavelength within the desired range are
      available for use in the methods of the present invention. The
      colloid is exposed to the light for a period of time that is
      dependent upon the intensity of the light used. The exposure time
      is usually less than about 100 hours and typically the exposure
      time is about 60 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Without intending to be bound by any single theory, it is
      believed that the observed bimodal growth process results from an
      edge-selective particle fusion mechanism wherein four smaller,
      Type 1, nanoprisms come together in step-wise fashion to form a
      larger, Type 2, nanoprism as depicted in the shaded region of FIG.
      6. Several observations are consistent with this mechanism. First,
      bimodal growth results in Type 1 and Type 2 prisms where four of
      the former prisms can fit together to form a prism with dimensions
      (cumulative edge length=140+-17 nm) that compare well with the
      latter (150+-16 nm). Second, edge selective growth occurs with no
      apparent change in nanostructure thickness in going from the Type
      1 to Type 2 nanoprisms. Third, as shown in FIG. 2(A), detailed
      time-dependent UV-VIS-NIR measurements show that the onset of the
      growth of the band at 1065 nm (assigned to Type 2) is
      significantly delayed in comparison with the growth of the band at
      640 nm (assigned to Type 1) indicating that the fusion of
      nanoprisms occurs only after Type 1 nanoprisms accumulate. Fourth,
      as shown in FIG. 7, dimer and trimer intermediates (depicted as 2
      and 3, respectively, in FIG. 6) are observed during the early
      stages of Type 2 nanoprism growth. Electrodynamics calculations
      for the possible intermediate species in the fusion growth process
      show that the dimer and trimer intermediates have plasmon
      excitations close to 600 and 1065 nm meaning that Type 1
      nanoprisms and the dimmer/trimer intermediates can all absorb at
      600 nm. This leads to the excited state needed for particle
      fusion. However, Type 2 nanoprisms do not absorb at that
      wavelength, which is why these nanoprisms represent the end of the
      nanoparticle growth path.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] This edge- and crystal face-selective (side={110} lattice
      planes) fusion growth is unusual, especially in view of the many
      other possible products that could arise from oligomerization of
      the Type 1 nanoprisms depicted in FIG. 6 outside of the shaded
      region. If these forms exist, they must be in a fast equilibrium
      with the main growth route (shaded in Scheme 1), since they are
      not observed by TEM. While methods of fusing spherical
      nanoparticles into nanowire structures (CdTe or PbSe) after
      removal of surface ligands, as well as other examples involving
      spherical particle fusion, are known in the art, the methods of
      the present invention are the only methods that use photochemistry
      to effect the edge- and crystal face-selective particle fusion
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The bimodal growth appears to contradict previous results
      in which unimodal nanoprism growth was observed when visible light
      from a conventional fluorescent tube was used as the excitation
      source (co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/256,875;
      Publication No. 20030136223 A1). However, by careful analysis of
      the optical properties of these nanostructures and the effects of
      photolysis on them, surface plasmon cooperativity has been
      identified in the photochemistry of silver nanoprisms. As shown
      schematically in FIG. 3(A), excitation of a solution of silver
      nanoparticles at two wavelengths, 550+-20 nm (primary) and 450+-5
      nm (secondary) (I550:I450=2:1, FIG. 3A) completely inhibits the
      formation of Type 2 nanoprisms. This treatment results in the
      exclusive formation of the smaller, Type 1, nanoprisms. By varying
      the wavelength of the secondary beam, a 550-nm/340-nm coupled
      beam, in which the 340-nm light coincides with the out-of-plane
      quadrupole resonances of the Type 1 and Type 2 nanoprisms, can
      also inhibit the growth of Type 2 nanoprisms. As shown in FIG. 8
      however, in the cases of 550-nm/395-nm, 550-nm/610-nm, and
      550-nm/650-nm coupled beams, in which the secondary wavelengths
      fall within the dipole resonances of the silver nanospheres (395
      nm) and Type 1 nanoprisms (610 and 650 nm), respectively, bimodal
      growth is observed. Thus only secondary wavelengths that can
      excite quadrupole plasmon modes can inhibit bimodal growth. It is
      this photo-cooperativity that leads to the results observed with a
      fluorescent tube as the excitation source. Interestingly, the
      emission spectrum of a fluorescent tube, shown in FIG. 9, exhibits
      bands at 546-nm and 440-nm and has the appropriate intensity ratio
      (100%:40%) to effect photosynthetic cooperativity and hence
      unimodal growth. Consistent with this conclusion, when a 550+-20
      nm band filter is used with a fluorescent tube to effect the
      photosynthetic conversion, bimodal growth is observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
      the silver colloid starting material is exposed to light of two
      different wavelengths to produce dual beam excitation and unimodal
      growth. Using this method, bimodal growth can be selectively
      turned off with one fixed secondary beam allowing the formation of
      nanoprisms having a desired edge length, through a unimodal growth
      process. This type of cooperative photo-control over nanoparticle
      growth results in the synthesis of relatively monodisperse samples
      of nanoprisms with a desired edge length in the range of about 30
      nm to about 120 nm simply by controlling the excitation wavelength
      of the primary beam. Therefore, this embodiment provides the first
      methods of controlling particle size and shape using light as a
      directing element. By varying the primary light source between the
      wavelength of about 450 nm and about 700 nm, with a fixed
      secondary beam corresponding to the out-of-plane quadrupole
      plasmon excitation unimodal growth results to generate a solution
      of nanoprisms of a desired average size.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Using this method, it is possible to synthesize nanoprisms
      with in-plane dipole plasmon resonances with edge lengths ranging
      from about 30 nm to about 120 nm. The average edge lengths of the
      resulting nanoprisms correlate well with the wavelength of the
      primary excitation source in which a longer primary excitation
      wavelength produces larger particles with in-plane dipole plasmons
      (the red-most peak in each spectrum) that are red-shifted with
      respect to the excitation wavelength. For example, when the
      secondary wavelength of light is fixed at 340 nm and the primary
      wavelength of light is between about 430 nm and about 470 nm and
      the nanoprisms have an edge length between about 31 nm and about
      45 nm; when the secondary wavelength of light is fixed at 340 nm
      and the primary wavelength of light is between about 470 nm and
      about 510 nm the nanoprisms have an edge length between about 53
      nm and about 57 nm; when the secondary wavelength of light is
      fixed at 340 nm and the primary wavelength of light is between
      about 500 nm and about 540 nm, the nanoprisms have an edge length
      between about 53 nm and about 71 nm; when the secondary wavelength
      of light is fixed at 340 nm and the primary wavelength of light is
      between about 530 nm and about 570 nm, the nanoprisms have an edge
      length between about 64 nm and about 80 nm; when the secondary
      wavelength of light is fixed at 340 nm and the primary wavelength
      of light is between about 580 nm and about 620 nm, the nanoprisms
      have an edge length between about 84 nm and about 106 nm; and when
      the secondary wavelength of light is fixed at 340 nm and the
      primary wavelength of light is between about 650 nm and about 690
      nm, the nanoprisms have an edge length between about 106 nm and
      about 134 nm. This type of growth is not necessarily a result of
      particle fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Another feature of using wavelength to control the size of
      the nanoprisms formed is that, as shown in FIG. 10, subsequent
      addition of silver spherical nanoparticles to the nanoprism
      colloid does not lead to enlargement of the nanoprism but instead
      the added particles grow into nanoprisms similar in size to those
      present as determined by the excitation wavelength. This result is
      in contrast with conventional thermal strategies for controlling
      particle sizes, in which addition of precursors typically leads to
      larger particles. Therefore, the methods of the present invention
      represent fundamentally new ways of controlling particle size
      through wavelength modulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The particle size control observed here is not a result of
      photothermal (or optical "burning") effects as those effects have
      been invoked in other studies involving intense pulse laser
      irradiation of metal nanostructures. By comparison, the light
      source used to effect nanoparticle conversion by the methods of
      the present invention is very weak, having a beam power of less
      than about 0.2 watts. According to the equation,
      [Delta]T=[Delta]H/Cp where, [Delta]H is the absorbed photon
      energy, and Cp is the heat capacity of silver (0.235 J.K&lt;-1&gt;
      .g&lt;-1&gt; ), single 550 nm photon absorption by a Type 1 prism
      can only lead to a negligible increase in temperature and the
      cumulative experimentally-determined temperature increase after 50
      hours of photolysis (550+-20 nm) was less than 10[deg.] C. Thus,
      photo-induced thermal effects are not responsible for the particle
      growth and size control in the methods of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Surface plasmons are typically studied as physical
      properties of metal nanostructures rather than chemical tools that
      provide control over growth and ultimate particle dimensions. The
      methods of the present invention take advantage of plasmon
      excitation in the nanoprism growth process, both for Type 1
      particles which grow from the initially produced colloidal
      particles to a size that depends on the dipole plasmon wavelength,
      and for Type 2 particles whose growth also requires dipole plasmon
      excitation, but is inhibited by quadrupole plasmon excitation.
      Without intending to be bound by any one theory, it is believed
      that plasmon excitation leads to ligand dissociation at the
      particle edges, whereby the local fields are the most intense,
      allowing the Type 1 particles to grow through the addition of
      silver atoms or clusters and the Type 2 particles to form by
      particle fusion. The results presented in the following examples

      [0034] This example illustrates one method of making silver
      colloids suitable for use in the methods of the present invention.
      AgNO3 (99.998%) and NaBH4 (99%) were obtained from Aldrich, and
      bis (p-sulfonatophenyl) phenylphosphine dihydrate dipotassium
      (BSPP) was purchased from Strem Chemicals, Inc. All H2O was
      purified by a Barnstead Nanopure H2O purification system
      (resistance=18.1 M[Omega].cm). 100 mL of nanopure H2O, 1 mL of 30
      mM trisodium citrate, and 2 mL of 5 mM AgNO3 solution were mixed
      in a 250 mL three neck flask. The flask was immersed in an ice
      bath, and the solution was bubbled with argon under constant
      stirring for approximately 30 minutes. 1 mL of 50 mM aqueous NaBH4
      (ice-cold, freshly made) was quickly injected into the solution
      under vigorous stirring. The clear solution immediately turned
      light yellow. The reaction was allowed to proceed for
      approximately 15 min, and 1 mL of 5 mM BSPP solution and a 0.5 mL
      aliquot of NaBH4 were added to the solution in a dropwise fashion.
      The colloids were left overnight stirring in the dark.

      <br>
      [0035] This example illustrates the production of a nanoprism
      suspensions by the photo-initiated plasmon excitation means of the
      present invention. A xenon lamp (Novalight system, 150 W, light
      output approximately 12 W, Photon Technology, Inc.) was utilized
      as the light source for the photosynthetic experiments. Optical
      band filters (diameter=25 mm, band width=10 nm or 40 nm) were
      obtained from Intor, Inc. The photoconversion of nanospheres to
      nanoprisms was performed in a glass flask or quartz cell. The
      quartz cell was only used in double beam experiments when light
      less than 400 nm was introduced. The silver colloid was sealed in
      the reactor wrapped with aluminum foil. For the single beam
      excitation experiment, the 550+-20 nm beam (green, approximately
      100,000 Lux, measured with a digital light meter, Model LM-1,
      Family Defense Products) was introduced to the silver colloids
      through a hole (ca. 20 mm in diameter) on the aluminum wrap. The
      distance between the reactor and the light output window was
      approximately 8 cm. For the double beam excitation experiment, two
      holes (approximately 20 mm in diameter) were made in the aluminum
      wrap, and two beams (the 550+-20 nm primary beam and a
      wavelength-varied secondary beam with FWHM approximately 10 nm)
      from two Xe lamps were simultaneously introduced to the silver
      colloid, with the beams forming a 90[deg.] angle. The silver
      colloids were exposed to the light sources for about 50 hours
      (variable with light intensity). To control the silver nanoprism
      size (edge length), a primary beam (450, 490, 520, 550, 600 and
      670 nm, respectively, width=40 nm) coupled with a secondary beam
      (450 nm or 340 nm, width=10 nm) was used to photolyse the silver
      colloid. For the laser excitation experiment, the laser beam
      (532.8 nm, CW, light output approximately 0.2 W, Nd:YAG) was
      directly introduced to the reactor containing the silver colloid.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] TEM imaging of the nanoprims was performed with a 200 kV
      Hitachi H8100. Approximately 400 particles were used for the
      particle size statistical analyses. High-resolution TEM imaging
      was carried out with a 200 kV field-emission Hitachi HF 2000
      electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Imaging System.
      UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopic measurements of colloids were performed
      with a Cary 500 spectrometer. The emission spectrum of a
      fluorescent tube (white daylight type, Philips TLD 36 W/865 or
      General Electric 40 W) was measured with a HP 8453 diode array

      <br>
      [0047] In the calculation, it is assumed that the absorbed photon
      energy is rapidly equilibrated among the conduction electrons,
      resulting in hot electron gas. The hot electrons equilibrate with
      the phonons on a time scale of a few picoseconds, which leads to a
      temperature increase in the s silver lattice. The temperature
      increase of silver particles under 550+-20 nm beam excitation can
      be estimated by the equation [Delta]T=[Delta]H/Cp, where, [Delta]H
      is the total absorbed energy, and Cp is the heat capacity for
      silver nanoparticles (assumed to be the bulk value Cp=235
      J/(KgK)). If one photon is absorbed by a Type 1 nanoprism, then
      [Delta]T, the photon energy/heat capacity is 0.007 K.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In a second calculation, we assume that the beam energy
      (beam power=0.2 W, measured by a light meter) is 100% absorbed
      (for estimation of maximum temperature increase), and that there
      is a 1 picosecond time scale for heat transfer from the surface
      plasmon excited state to the silver lattice, and during this time
      there is no heat dissipation to the surroundings. In this case,
      [Delta]H=0.2 (W)*1*10&lt;-12 &gt; (s), Cp=0.235 (JK&lt;-1&gt;
      g&lt;-1&gt; )*0.1 (L)*0.1*10&lt;-3&gt; (molL&lt;-1&gt;
      )*108(gmol&lt;-1&gt; ), thus, [Delta]T is approximately equal to
      10&lt;-9 &gt; K.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Once the electrons and lattice have reached equilibrium,
      the heat is finally dissipated into the surroundings (water and
      air) by phonon-phonon couplings. Energy "storing" by the silver
      lattice as temperature increases is negligible because the photon
      flux in these methods is extremely low, and the silver lattice can
      efficiently dissipate heat to the surroundings. In addition,
      multiple photon absorption is statistically negligible due to the
      extremely low photon flux.<br>

      [0050] This example demonstrates the production and
      characterization of a suspension of nanoprims having a bimodal
      size distribution by the methods of the present invention.
      Colloidal silver nanoparticles (diameter 4.8+-1.1 nm) were
      irradiated with a narrow band light source (using a 150 W xenon
      lamp (light output approximately 12 W) with an optical bandpass
      filter; center wavelength=550 nm, width=40 nm) for approximately
      50 h. TEM shows that the colloid formed consists of two different
      size distributions of nanoprisms (FIG. 1A and inset), of which the
      smaller and the larger particles have average edge lengths of
      70+-12 nm and 150+-16 nm, respectively. The thicknesses of both
      size nanoprisms are almost identical at 9.8+-1.0 nm (FIGS. 1B and
      C). High-resolution TEM studies reveal that the {111} crystal face
      forms the top/base plane of the nanoprism, and three {110} crystal
      faces form the side planes of both sizes of nanoprisms. The growth
      process was been monitored by UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy (FIG. 2A).
      Disappearance of the plasmon band (at 395 nm) during the reaction
      is associated with the spherical silver particles and formation of
      two new strong bands (at 640 nm and 1065 nm, respectively)
      associated with the Type 1 and Type 2 nanoprisms, respectively.
      The band for the Type 1 prisms is initially centered at
      [lambda]max=680 nm and gradually blue shifts to [lambda]max=640
      nm. The second strong band at [lambda]max=1065 nm is assigned to
      Type 2 particles. In addition to the two strong surface plasmon
      bands, two other weak resonances are observed at 340 and 470 nm,
      respectively (FIG. 2A curve 6).<br>

      [0051] This example demonstrates the use of dual beam plasmon
      excitation to form silver nanoprisms of a discrete size. Silver
      nanoparticles (4.8+-1.1 nm) were excited at two wavelengths,
      550+-20 nm (primary) and 450+-5 nm (secondary) (I550:I450=2:1,
      FIG. 3A). Double-beam excitation at these wavelengths results in
      exclusive formation of the smaller Type 1 nanoprisms (72+-8 nm),
      as evidenced by UV-VIS-NIR spectra and TEM analysis (FIGS. 3B and
      C). A 550-nm/340-nm coupled beam, in which the 340-nm light
      coincides with the out-of-plane quadrupole resonances of the Type
      1 and Type 2 nanoprisms, also inhibits the growth of Type 2
      nanoprisms and the final UV-VIS-NIR spectrum is very similar to
      the spectrum obtained from the two beam 550-nm/450-nm experiment.
      However, in the cases of 550-nm/395-nm, 550-nm/610-nm, and
      550-nm/650-nm coupled beams, in which the secondary wavelengths
      fall within the dipole resonances of the silver nanospheres (395
      nm) and Type 1 nanoprisms (610 and 650 nm), respectively, bimodal
      growth is observed (FIG. 8).<br>

      [0052] This example demonstrates a way of controlling nanoprism
      size and shape using light as a directing element. The silver
      colloid was exposed to a primary light source (450-700 nm) with a
      fixed secondary beam (340 nm, corresponding to out-of-plane
      quadrupole plasmon excitation). Silver nanoprisms with six
      different average edge lengths (38+-7 nm, 50+-7 nm, 62+-9 nm,
      72+-8 nm, 95+-11 nm, and 120+-14 nm) but similar particle
      thickness (10+-1 nm) were synthesized from colloidal particles
      (4.8+-1.1 nm) using primary excitation wavelengths of 450+-20 nm,
      490+-20 nm, 520+-20 nm, 550+-20 nm, 600+-20 nm, and 670+-20 nm,
      respectively. The average edge lengths of the resulting nanoprisms
      correlate well with the wavelength of the primary excitation
      source (FIG. 4B), which shows that a longer primary excitation
      wavelength produces larger particles with in-plane dipole plasmons
      (the red-most peak in each spectrum) that are red-shifted with

      Abstract --- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide Ag nanoparticles
      easily redispersed even if a dispersed solution of Ag
      nanoparticles is dried and hardened or is made into a state close
      thereto by a method of concentration or the like, and from which a
      dispersing agent can be removed by a simple operation, and to
      obtain a dispersed solution comprising the Ag nanoparticles.
      SOLUTION: The Ag nanoparticles with a particle diameter of 1 to 20
      nm comprising the ammine complex of silver nitrate as a dispersing
      agent can be obtained by mixing silver nitrate, a reducing agent
      which does not show reducibility in an organic solvent and
      alkylamine in an organic solvent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] Redispersion is easy even if the state or near dryness by a
      method such as concentrated dispersion solution of Ag
      nanoparticles, and moreover, the present invention, the Ag and
      nanoparticles can be removed in a simple operation dispersant
      providing a dispersion solution containing Ag nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Recently, with the miniaturization of various electronic
      devices, lighter, and higher performance, improved characteristics
      are required for materials used in electronic components.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In particular, metallic nanoparticles as compared to
      ceramic substrates, such as heat-resistant glass, as the material
      of the circuit wiring to a resin substrate having a low melting
      point, electrical conductivity similar to that of a metal bulk as
      possible can be obtained by sintering at a low temperature process
      But it has been requested. It is said that since the melting point
      of the particles is reduced particle diameter is the size of
      several nanometers, Ag nanoparticles and is promising as a low
      temperature sintering material among metals. Further, Ag
      nanoparticles having a uniform shape are monodisperse, can be
      expected to use the nanocrystal material having a high performance
      pigment, a three-dimensional structure or two-dimensional.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] However, in case of using such a circuit wiring of various
      electronic components is actually a process for preparing a low
      cost Ag nanoparticles in large quantities are required. Methods of
      synthesizing Ag nanoparticles having a particle diameter of
      several nanometers which is been many reports until now, mass,
      and, it was as hard to say the method excellent in industrial
      productivity at low cost. I was considered to be in the efficiency
      of the purification process and subsequent reaction concentration
      when preparing the Ag nanoparticle this cause.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Conventionally, (Patent Documents 1 to 3) method by
      reducing an aqueous solution containing a silver salt, obtained
      colloidal silver is known.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Furthermore, (Patent Documents 4 to 6) the method for
      producing colloidal silver particles in high concentration using a
      polymeric pigment dispersant have been proposed. By using the
      polymeric pigment dispersant, a colloidal solution of a
      concentrated silver fine silver particles of 93% or higher are
      obtained after concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Usually, in the case of synthesizing nanoparticles by a wet
      process, it is necessary to purify the work of removing the excess
      dispersing agent and the reducing agent after the reaction. It is
      said that conventional, recrystallization, ultrafiltration, and
      centrifugal separation method is performed as the refining
      operation, the recrystallization is desirable as a method of
      purifying large quantities of nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Excess dispersant and a reducing agent dissolved therein by
      is weakly agglomerated nano-particles by adding to the reaction
      mixture in which the nanoparticles are dispersed poor solvent
      nanoparticles are hardly dispersed, filtered and decanted
      recrystallization method The method is to remove the solution,
      purifying the nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] This method is the simple, but to dispersants needed to
      re-dispersion of the nanoparticles or is removed with a weak
      excess dispersant adsorption force to the nanoparticle
      dispersions, aggregation of nanoparticles with each other, such as
      too strong in some cases the cause is not redisperse. Further,
      when re-dispersed into a good solvent to the next step, you should
      have sufficiently removed the poor solvent used for the above, the
      dispersion stability of the nanoparticles is exacerbated in the
      case of high concentration of nanoparticles in particular.
      Therefore, a technique is distilled off as much as possible the
      anti-solvent under vacuum or atmospheric pressure in order to
      remove the poor solvent is taken. In some cases re-dispersibility
      is poor by making the state close to dryness and dryness at this
      time. This is because the particles tend to aggregate strongly the
      drying time had to be done carefully over the addition of the good
      solvent to remove the poor solvent, a state wet with a solvent
      always.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Thus, in the case of synthesizing nanoparticles by wet
      process, especially, the more manageable in the redispersion step
      or purification step, i.e. nanoparticles with excellent handling
      properties has been required. Efficiency of purification also
      increases the handling property is good, it is possible to obtain
      nanoparticles at low cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] On the other hand, it can be said to be re-dispersed easily
      even when a state close to dryness and dryness are possible,
      nanoparticles are synthesized using a polymeric dispersant, and
      has excellent handling properties. However, there remains a
      problem in that it is necessary to use ultrafiltration during
      purification Further, when the adsorption force between the
      nanoparticles and the dispersant is strong in many cases when the
      polymer dispersant, converted to a dispersant Suit can be
      difficult to such particles. Further, the electric resistance is
      intimidated by the polymer dispersant is not removed by heating at
      the time of firing is concerned in the case of using the material
      of the conductive paste.<br>

      nanoparticles can be removed by a simple operation dispersant is
      where it is most required currently, it has not yet been obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] That is, in the manufacturing method 3 described, since it
      is the reaction of an aqueous solution, the particle size obtain
      fine particles of several nanometers in size is difficult to
      Patent Document 1 supra.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The production method according to 6, since it is the
      reaction of an aqueous solution, to obtain fine particles of
      several nanometers in size is difficult to Patent Document 4
      supra. Further, the polymeric pigment dispersant is excellent in
      dispersibility, but a special purification system of fine
      nanoparticles colloidal solution, and ultrafiltration
      concentration step is required. Further, when using the conductive
      ink or conductive paste, high temperature is required in order to
      decompose the polymeric pigment dispersant, problem still remains
      as a low-temperature sintering property.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In the method of 7 Patent Document, it is not generated by
      the thermal decomposition method using a raw material
      acetylacetonate salts of the metal the metal particles to the
      dispersant alkyl amine, in this case, must be heated to decompose
      there is a problem in productivity because it requires special raw
      materials and can be omitted. Further, it requires a special
      vacuum equipment such as a gas evaporation method for the
      production of silver particles to the dispersing agent alkylamine
      in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Therefore, in the present invention, redispersion is easy
      even after the state or near dryness solution concentrated Ag
      nanoparticles are dispersed, that is excellent in handling
      properties of the nanoparticles, the substitution of dispersant
      desired It is a technical object to provide an optimal combination

      method for producing the Ag nanoparticles, which comprises
      admixing an alkyl amine and a reducing agent does not exhibit
      reducing ability of silver nitrate, in an organic solvent.<br>

      [0021] Further, the present invention is a dispersion liquid,
      characterized in that together with the Ag nanoparticles, is
      contained as a dispersant ammine complexes of silver nitrate in an
      organic solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Redispersion and also is easy, Ag nanoparticles according
      to the present invention can be removed in a simple operation
      dispersants even after the state or near dryness concentrated

      [0025] The abundance of silver nitrate ammine complex of Ag
      nanoparticles according to the present invention, 10 ~ 30wt% is
      preferred. Problem of dispersion stability becomes poor in case of
      less than 10wt%, resulting in up the viscosity of the solution
      when it exceeds 30wt% results. More preferably 20 ~ 28wt%. In
      addition, I was calculated from alkyl amine component scattered by
      (calorimetry) TG is abundance of ammine complexes of silver
      nitrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The average particle size of the Ag nanoparticles according
      to the present invention is 1 ~ 20nm. In the process of the
      present invention, can be obtained on an industrial scale Ag
      nanoparticles less than 1nm is difficult. In the case of more than
      20nm, it is not practical there is a problem with low-temperature
      sintering properties when applied to a conductive paste or the
      like. Preferably from 1 ~ 15nm, and more preferably 1 ~ 10nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The concentration of Ag nanoparticles in the dispersion of
      Ag nanoparticles according to the present invention, it is
      sufficient to variously changed depending on the application, it
      contains 10 ~ 80wt% of Ag nanoparticles in an organic solvent is
      preferred. As the organic solvent, is not limited as long as the
      dispersed Ag nanoparticles is stable, for example, toluene,
      terpineol, hexane, tetradecanoic like.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Next, I described a method for manufacturing the dispersion
      solution of Ag nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles according to the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Silver nitrate is preferably a silver raw material in the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Reducing agent in the present invention is a reducing agent
      having no reducing ability in an organic solvent, preferably
      formic acid ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, isoascorbic
      acid, isoascorbic derivatives. In the case of using sodium
      borohydride as a reducing agent, can not be obtained particles of
      interest of the present invention aggregate and formation of large
      particles occurs.<br>
      <br>
      Further, for dissolving in a small moisture can be produced
      industrially manage the water content of the organic solvent used
      is required, it is difficult to sodium borohydride.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The alkyl amines of the present invention can be made basic
      liquid to be able to form an ammine complex coordinated with
      silver ion as silver nitrate, to promote the reduction reaction,
      and further, it is an ammine complex of silver nitrate is not
      particularly limited as long as it can be dispersed stably in an
      organic solvent Ag nanoparticles adhered, but considering
      coordinating to silver ions of silver nitrate and dispersion
      stability of Ag nanoparticles in organic solvent Then, the primary
      alkyl amine of long chain.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The amount of the reducing agent, may be any amount
      sufficient to reduce the silver nitrate, silver nitrate,
      preferably the ratio of the reducing agent is 1:1 to 1:2 molar
      ratio. In the case of a large amount than the above range, there
      is no meaning to be added more than necessary because the effect
      is saturated amount of the reducing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The addition amount of the alkyl amine, necessary amount of
      a combination of the required amount to the amount required to
      basic humoral to promote the reduction reaction, as a dispersing
      agent to adhere to the Ag nanoparticles as a nitrate ammine
      complex is the ratio of alkyl amine nitrate 1:1 molar ratio. 1 to
      1:2. 1 is preferred. In the case of a large amount than the above
      range, there is no meaning to be added more than necessary because
      the effect is saturated alkyl amine.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Order of addition of silver nitrate and alkyl amine and a
      reducing agent is not particularly limited as long as it is well
      mixed.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As long as the silver salt, an alkyl amine and a reducing
      agent are mixed thoroughly, mixing and stirring means is not
      particularly limited.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The mixing and stirring time, it is not necessary to heat
      particular, may be performed at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Reaction solution at first, it is a clear, colorless
      solution white crystals of iso-ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid and
      silver nitrate is dispersed, but exhibits a yellow color
      characteristic of the Ag nanoparticles with stirring time,
      further, yellow to blackish ( it is solution of a thick yellow).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In the case of using formic acid in the reducing agent, a
      method of dropping the formic acid in the mixed solution of the
      alkylamine nitrate advance. Including the reaction solution is
      clear, colorless solution of silver nitrate is dispersed, but a
      yellow color characteristic of the silver particles together with
      the stirring time, and further, it is a solution of (thick yellow)
      yellow blackish.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] When poured into a mixed solution of methanol and water or
      a large amount of acetone to the resulting reaction solution,
      precipitate Ag nanoparticles are weakly aggregated results. Was
      removed by decantation and the supernatant, again, the addition of
      a mixed solvent of water and methanol or acetone. Repeat this
      operation, to remove the alkyl amine or excess of silver nitrate
      reduction reaction after.<br>
      <br>
      Remove the precipitate of Ag nanoparticles weakly agglomerated,
      and the solvent is removed sufficiently due to a rotary evaporator
      and re-dispersed into an organic solvent such as toluene or hexane
      again after being dried. Can be prepared Ag nanoparticle
      dispersion solution of the desired concentration by weight by
      adding a solvent according to the weight of the solid content of
      Ag which is generated at this time.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] When preparing the Ag nanoparticles by wet synthesis method
      as described above, the Ag ammine complex composed the raw
      material also acts as a dispersing agent was estimated from the
      experimental facts below.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The resultant mixture is agglomerated precipitated with
      methanol Ag nanoparticles produced by (i) the wet synthesis
      method, and repeatedly washed with methanol, it was attempted to
      redispersion in toluene and concentrated to dryness after the
      aggregation of Ag nanoparticles thing was easily re-dispersed.
      After coagulated precipitated with methanol Ag nanoparticles
      prepared by (ii) the wet synthesis method, it was washed with
      water and aggregate, washed with methanol, and dried well was
      subsequently redispersed in toluene after dryness place, I was
      easily re-dispersed. After coagulated precipitated with methanol
      Ag nanoparticles prepared by (iii) the wet synthesis method, it
      was washed with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride
      agglomerates. Subsequently, in step four, when the post (remove
      the salt with water) which was washed with water, and thoroughly
      dried, it was attempted to redispersion in toluene and
      concentrated to dryness after the precipitate formed re-dispersion
      is deteriorated.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, when washed with formic acid and methanol and the
      precipitate washed, and rated on the weight of the organic
      component by thermal analysis, organic significantly compared to
      (a state of the (i), of (ii)) before cleaning component had weight
      loss (Figure 1). After coagulated precipitated with methanol Ag
      nanoparticles prepared by (iv) the wet synthesis method, it was
      washed with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride agglomerates.
      When the post (remove salt by using a large amount of water),
      which was subsequently washed with water, water was removed from
      the system during while adding toluene so as not to dryness, and
      tried to re-dispersed in toluene and re-dispersed easily .<br>
      <br>
      [0042] When preparing the Ag nanoparticles by wet synthesis method
      described above, the experimental fact shows that the material
      that reacts with chloride ions has a role as a dispersant. In the
      Ag nanoparticles according to the present invention, substances
      that react with the chloride ions are Ag ions, it is understood to
      be a nitrate ammine complex since dissolved in toluene. Silver
      nitrate ammine complex is the silver chloride by chloride ion,
      alkyl amines attached to the Ag nanoparticles, Ag nanoparticles
      (Condition (iv)) dispersed in toluene as a dispersion agent.
      Re-dispersibility becomes worse when there dispersant only
      alkylamine, and the state or near dryness dispersion solution
      results (Condition (iii)) that precipitate may form. alkyl amines
      are removed by washing with a mixture solution of methanol added
      as a solvent for cleaning and formic acid added to remove the salt
      and alkylamine, the aggregates were washed with aqueous sodium
      chloride solution to the alkyl amine is liberated It can be seen
      from it that the organic component is reduced by thermal analysis
      ((i), Condition (iii)).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Thus, when prepared the Ag nanoparticles by a wet process
      described above, by ammine complex nitrate acts as a dispersing
      agent, is combined with the Ag nanoparticles ammine complex
      nitrate, and taken to dryness and the solvent was removed it is
      found to be excellent in re-dispersibility. (Condition (iv)) and
      can be easily decomposed while maintaining the dispersion
      stability of the chloride ion ammine complexes of silver nitrate
      are additional dispersant, dispersants another desired alkyl amine
      that acts as a dispersant I also becomes possible to convert.<br>

      200g / L. It is difficult to handle must be many amount of sodium
      citrate as a protective agent silver concentration is higher than
      this, the viscosity of the liquid is increased for this purpose.
      Also, silver particles produced are likely to aggregate. On the
      other hand, the production efficiency is low silver concentration
      is less than this. Note that the amount of ferrous sulfate may be
      any amount greater slightly than equimolar to the silver nitrate
      as long sufficiently reduced silver nitrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The amount of sodium citrate is suitably 2 to 7 times the
      number of moles of silver, about three times is preferable. The
      amount of sodium citrate is less than this, the adsorption amount
      for the fine silver particles is reduced, I can not be
      sufficiently suppressed aggregation. On the other hand, I will be
      difficult to handle the amount of sodium citrate is more than the
      above range, the viscosity of the liquid is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is possible to pre-mixed sodium citrate and ferrous
      sulfate, at room temperature, was charged with silver nitrate
      solution to the mixed solution, the reduction of silver nitrate.
      When submitting a silver nitrate solution in a mixed solution of
      sodium citrate and ferrous sulfate, the manufacturing method of
      the present invention, in a short time of 10 seconds the
      introduction of the silver nitrate solution.<br>
      By charging in a short time the silver nitrate solution, silver
      nanoparticles having a uniform particle size as a result.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Long time, for example, when added over a few minutes to
      ten minutes, the silver nitrate solution, the growth of particles
      silver particles formed in the mixing early at the core, caused by
      the reduction of silver nitrate, which is supplied thereafter was
      initially generated Since the spent, coarse particles become
      mixed, it becomes irregular silver particles having a particle
      size as a result.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] After switching on the silver nitrate solution in a mixed
      solution of sodium citrate and ferrous sulfate, several tens of
      seconds, and stirred at a rotation speed of 300rpm around, and to
      complete the uniform reaction throughout. There is no need to stir
      vigorously at 1000rpm or more. Silver is reduced by this reaction,
      the particle size can be obtained colloidal silver solution
      containing (silver nanoparticles) ultra-fine silver particles in
      the nanometer size.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Recovered after the solid-liquid separation by centrifugal
      separation of the silver colloid solution was washed with sodium
      citrate solid separated. To obtain a colloidal silver solution in
      which silver nanoparticles are dispersed by dispersing in water
      the solid was collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] According to the production method of the present
      invention, it is possible that the particle size of the average
      particle size of 20nm or less to obtain a uniform spherical silver
      nanoparticles. Also, when mixing the silver nitrate solution,
      there is no need to stir vigorously, thus, the production method
      of the present invention may be excessive device is small, to
      produce a Ginnano particles efficiently.<br>

      solution. This solution is subsequently injected into an organic
      solvent that is heated to a temperature greater than approximately
      100 DEG C. After washing with an organic solvent, such as an
      alcohol (including methanol, ethanol, propanol, and higher
      molecular-weight alcohols), oxide free coinage NP are prepared

      Abstract --- The invention is a novel photo-induced method for
      converting large quantities of silver nanospheres into nanoprisms,
      the nanoprisms formed by this method and applications in which the
      nanoprisms are useful. Significantly, this light driven process
      results in a colloid with a unique set of optical properties that
      directly relate to the nanoprism shape of the particles.
      Theoretical calculations coupled with experimental observations
      allow for the assignment of the nanoprism plasmon bands and the
      first identification of two distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances
      for a nanoparticle. Finally, unlike the spherical particles from
      which they derive and which Rayleigh light scatter in the blue,
      these nanoprisms exhibit scattering in the red, permitting
      multicolor diagnostic labels based not only on nanoparticle
