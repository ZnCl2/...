      <p><b>[ Excerpted from <a href="http://www.sisrc.com"
            ">http://www.sisrc.com</a> ]</b> </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Background</font></b> </p>
      <p>The Searl Effect Generator (SEG) technology, as applied to the
        commercial market, had been previously developed to the point
        where a few prototype SEG generators were made, and used for
        electricity generation and motion. Commercial interest at that
        time focused on the SEG’s transport potential and, under
        commercial pressure to deliver a fully functional system, the
        original generators were used and lost in a series of vehicular
        propulsion experiments and demonstrations. Funding was
        insufficient to continue with the manufacture of the required
        larger-scale pressurized cabin machines --- resulting in the
        termination of the project at that time. </p>
      <p>Although all the operating principles, precise proportions and
        weights of the required materials are known for three of the
        four required operating materials, the precise data of the
        original magnetic layer is uncertain. The objective of the
        current R&amp;D programme s to re-establish the original
        magnetic layer using modern and more efficient materials. </p>
      <p>Originally, the layered materials were constructed and
        magnetized by the now-defunct Midlands Electricity board under
        the direction of John Searl. </p>
      <p>Modern magnetic materials have advanced considerably, and old
        ones discontinued, so a series of tests need to be conducted to
        establish the optimum materials and processes, These tests need
        to comply with the working criteria required and must lead to a
        cost-effective manufacturing process. </p>
      <p>In recent times SISRC has been re-establishing the original
        research. Due to the very limited funding that has been
        available, only a partially functioning demonstration prototype
        of the SEG principles has been possible. This prototype consists
        of the innermost of the three composite tings required and
        several rollers… </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Technical Description</font></b> </p>
      <p>Physically the Searl Effect Generator (SEG) consists of three
        concentric rings each made of a composite of four different
        materials which are also concentrically attached to each other.
        The three rings are fixed to rotate around them, are rollers ---
        typically 10 on the first ring, 25 on the next, and 35 on the
        outer ring. Surrounding the rollers on the outer ring are coils
        which are connected in various configurations to supply either
        AC or DC current at a variety of voltages. Multiple magnetic
        poles are imprinted on the rings and rollers to form
        frictionless magnetic bearings. These also arrange the static
        charge into opposing charge clusters which cause the rollers to
        rotate around the circumference of the ring (as shown in Figure
        2) </p>

      </center>
      <p>Some expressions currently in use to describe the source of the
        energy for the SEG are the Space Fabric, Quantum Energy Field of
        Space, or Zero Point Energy. This is an unlimited and constant
        source of energy which can be made to flow when the correctly
        proportioned masses concerned are stimulated by the correct
        frequencies creating an ‘open system’. </p>
      <p>The idea of utilizing this source of energy is currently the
        subject o various devices and experiments such as the ‘Lamb
        Shift’, ‘Casimir Effect’, and the work of the Russian Nobel
        Prize winner Ilya Prigogine. However, these devices and
        experiments tend only to prove the existence of energy and not a
        method to create a coherent, ordered flow to produce useful
        power. </p>
      <p>In contrast, John Searl has discovered that, in order to create
        a steady and stable flow, all the masses of the device (and the
        stimulating frequencies) must conform to precise values
        determined mathematically by the ‘Law of the Squares’. A machine
        constructed to these principles produces a stable and useful
        power output. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Definition of a Surface-Operating SEG</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>A linear motor operating on a magnetic bearing with the
        characteristics of an auto-transformer. The SEG is defined as a
        device, which is constructed from 2,124 component parts, which
        make up 3 plates and 66 roller sets. 12 of the 2,124 components
        create the 3 plates, which act as reaction components. 2,112
        components are employed to create 66 roller sets, which act as
        active components. Each roller set consists of 8 segments
        constructed from 32 components. Each segment cannot be less than
        34 grams in weight, as the law of squares defines that value as
        the lowest value suitable for the reasonable generation of
        electricity. Therefore the smallest roller set must weigh 272
        grams, making a grand total of 2,244 grams per roller set for
        the smallest surface-bound SEG. </p>
      <p>Tolerance should be about 0.05 gram per roller set. The larger
        the error the greater is the loss of power within the unit.
        Therefore the total tolerance for the smallest SEG roller set
        must not be greater than 3.30 grams --- above this factor the
        SEG will not function. For the best results, the tolerance
        across the total 66 roller sets should not exceed 0.05 grams! </p>
      <p>The SEG is a step-up rotary transformer. In fact it’s a ‘three
        rotary transformers’ operational system, within a unit. The
        inner transformer output is fed in to the input of the second
        plate which increases the output of the second unit, thereby
        increasing its final output to a very high voltage. Therefore
        the SEG is just a prime mover for the production of clean
        electrical energy. The output windings must be designed to step
        down this output to 240 volts at 15 Kwatts… </p>
      <p>When the SEG rollers are brought into close proximity to the
        SEG Ring, te Searl Effect resonant magnetic field causes
        negative ions and electrons to be drawn into and accelerated
        through the machine. This process is assisted by the highly
        electron-attracting rare earth metal Neodymium. </p>
      <p>The unique mechanical and material arrangement of the SEG
        pulses the neodymium to continually release and replace the
        surplus electrons to provide electrical or mechanical power, or
        both. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Development</font></b> </p>
      <p>Prior to the production of complete 15 KW SEGs, a minimum of
        two demonstration Ring and Roller prototypes are to be produced.
      </p>
      <p>The ‘Ring’ is typical of the innermost of the three rings
        required to make a complete SEG. The 69-roller sets in a
        complete 3-ring SEG are identical. Six roller sets will be made
        for the prototype inner rings so that the Searl Effect can be
        demonstrated. </p>
      <p>The production of a self-running Ring and Roller prototype will
        establish the precise sequence and parameters of electrical,
        magnetizing and material processes required for the SEG and will
        demonstrate electrical power generation. An operating single
        inner ring with 1-8 rollers will also determine if a particular
        material will function correctly and at what level of power
        output… </p>

        <p><b>NOTES</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>"The Searl Effect Generator (SEG) is a magnetic diode, and what
        one may consider one of the original "Free Energy" Devices. The
        inventor of the technology is Professor John Robert Roy Searl of
        England. The SEG in essence is a composite ring made of an
        electron reservoir (a rare earth like Neodymium), a magnetized
        accelerator stage (Iron or Nickel), an electron flow regulator
        stage (Nylon 66 or Teflon), and finally, a paramagnetic layer
        (Aluminium or Copper). The design of the SEG is both beautifully
        simple and infuriatingly complex at the same time..." </p>
      <p>"Inside each of these IGVs there is a powerful 3-ring SEG which
        provides levity to the craft through a combination of magnetic,
        electrostatic and flywheel effects, many of which I freely admit
        are beyond my comprehension. </p>
      <p>"The iron element in the SEG "plate" (the big ring) is
        magnetized with a combined DC and AC magnetizing sequence which
        causes many poles to form all over the surface of the iron, in a
        wave like pattern corresponding to the AC frequency used. The
        iron element is then combined with the others (which are NOT
        involved in the magnetizing process) in a process called
        sintering - pushing them together under pressure. The same is
        done for the smaller magnets, or "rollers", except that each
        roller consists of eight stacked segments held together by the
        magnetic field. When you have twelve roller stacks and a
        correctly magnetized plate, and place the rollers on the plate
        as below, something truly amazing happens. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="imageubk.jpg" height="202" width="321"></p>
      </center>
      <p>"There are only ten rollers in the picture for safety reasons,
        as in a full set, the rollers will accelerate to 250km/h around
        the plate! This incredible feat is due to the instability of
        having an AC sine imprint on the plate and a cosine print on the
        rollers - instability created as the fields conflict causes the
        rollers to orbit the plate. They are held down by the magnetic
        field and thrown out by the centrifugal forces, so the rollers
        do not actually touch the plate when in motion. Thus, friction
        is virtually non-existent, and the high electrostatic charge
        accumulated by the SEG soon ionises all the nearby air and
        pushes it totally away from the SEG, enveloping it in an intense
        vacuum. High voltage flashover thus becomes impossible, and the
        potentials created by the generator can reach monstrous levels.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>"Unlike any other form of electrical technology, the presence
        of electron flow throught the generator actually cools it,
        reducing the resistance. This is due to free electrons being
        pulled out of the air and the resulting energy deficit causing
        the air to cool. As one places a greater and greater load on the
        SEG's induction coils (fitted so that the rollers pass through
        them to produce high-frequency AC), the rollers accelerate to
        accomodate the added energy drain, more power is pulled from the
        air, and the temperature lowers even further. A critical point
        is eventually reached. At 4 degrees Kelvin, the SEG
        superconducts and totally loses all electrical resistance. At
        this point, it levitates, completely enveloped in a perfect
        vacuum. Without control, it will accelerate up away from the
        Earth and disappear off into space, never to be seen again. To
        control it, a powerful radio frequency emitted nearby is
        required. If the same RF is transmitted as the AC frequency used
        to magnetise the rollers, they will completely stop. This acts
        as an ideal control gate, preventing the loss of costly
        generators. </p>
