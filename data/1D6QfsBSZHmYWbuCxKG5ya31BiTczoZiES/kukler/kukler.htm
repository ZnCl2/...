          is actuated by cylinder compression pressure acting against
          the exposed face (31) of piston means (30, 35) to compress
          fuel in high pressure chamber (45) in injector body (10). The
          piston means (30, 35) moves against spring (36) and
          controllable fuel pressure in low pressure chamber (37). The
          high pressure chamber (45) communicates with injection orifice
          (68) via delivery chamber (65) and non-return delivery valve
          (56). Fuel delivery is regulated by varying fuel pressure in
          low pressure chamber (37) and various means are disclosed for
          controlling this pressure. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This invention relates to injecting
          apparatus for injecting a fluid under pressure, e.g. fuel
          injecting apparatus for internal combustion engines, apparatus
          for injecting liquids, e.g. a catalyst into chemical reaction
          vessels under pressure, and other apparatus for injecting a
          dose of fluid. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although the present invention is
          applicable to any situation where a measured dose of fluid is
          to be injected under pressure, it will be convenient to
          describe the invention with particular reference to injecting
          fuel into an internal combustion engine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Fuel injectors used in internal
          combustion engines, including both spark ignition and
          compression ignition (or diesel) engines generally utilise an
          external pump for supplying the fuel under sufficient pressure
          to be injected into the engine cylinder. The timing of the
          injection point in the engine operating cycle is determined by
          externally controlling the operation of an injector valve by
          mechanical means. One disadvantage of providing external
          pumping and control is the need for the provision and
          servicing of such external systems. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A general problem with injectors,
          particularly ones supplied from an external pump, is lack of
          responsiveness to any faulty condition in the associated
          cylinder. For example, if a piston ring is broken, known
          injectors will continue to inject fuel charges into the
          cylinder. Thus fuel will be exhausted from the engine leading
          to air pollution by exhausted unburnt fuel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has been proposed in the past to
          utilise the build up of pressure within the cylinder of an
          internal combustion engine during the compression stroke to
          provide the motive force to compress fuel within the injector
          body. For example, there has been proposed a fuel injector
          which has a body, and a piston which is movable within the
          body under the action of cylinder pressure. The movement of
          the piston in the injector body causes an increase in pressure
          of a fuel charge introduced into the body to a point where the
          pressure enables a non-return valve associated with the
          injector nozzle to open and allow the fuel to be injected
          under pressure into the engine cylinder. Problems with this
          device include difficulty and uncertainty in closing of the
          valve leading to fuel continuing to dribble from the injector
          after the desired cut off point, and also a general lack of
          control over the operation of the injector. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. Pat. No. 2,516,690 in the name
          of French shows a fuel injector which utilises the associated
          engine cylinder pressure to develop the pressure to inject the
          fuel. The French apparatus has a simple spring biased
          non-return valve at the injection nozzle so that the opening
          and closing of the injection nozzle is solely controlled by
          pressure differential and spring force. Some control of
          pressure developed is provided by a non-return valve in an
          outlet from the pumping chamber and an adjustable flow
          restrictor downstream of the non-return valve. The French
          apparatus has very limited ability to enable control of the
          injector operation including timing, injection pressure,
          volume of fluid injected, and degree of positiveness in
          action. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,856 in the name
          of Smith also shows an injector using engine cylinder pressure
          to develop the injecting pressure. The Smith apparatus uses a
          non-return valve as the injection valve. A solenoid operated
          non-return valve is provided in the outlet from the pumping
          chamber and an adjustable flow restrictor is provided in the
          outlet line downstream of the non-return valve to enable
          adjustment of the possible rate of flow when the solenoid
          non-return valve is opened. In a similar manner to the French
          US patent, the Smith injector has very limited ability to
          enable control of the injector operation including timing,
          injection pressure, volume of fluid injected, and degree of
          positiveness in action. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,151 in the name
          of Trenne shows a similar injector to the Smith injector
          except that there is provision for adjusting the clearance
          between the outlet valve member controlled by the solenoid and
          its associated seat so that that adjustment enables some
          control of the flow rate for fuel flowing out of the control
          chamber. As with the French and Smith specifications, the
          Trenne injector has limited degrees of control and limited
          positiveness in operation, particularly the non-return
          injector valve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to the present invention
          there is provided an injecting apparatus for injecting a fluid
          under pressure, the injecting apparatus including: a body,
          piston means movable in the body under the action of
          externally applied fluid pressure, the piston means being
          operable to compress in a high pressure chamber, fluid to be
          injected the piston means being movable against the action of
          fluid pressure in a low pressure chamber whereby the movement
          of the piston means is selectively controllable by controlling
          the fluid pressure in the low pressure chamber, and an
          injection valve and an associated injection orifice in fluid
          communication with the high pressure chamber whereby high
          pressure fluid from the high pressure chamber can be injected
          through the injection orifice upon opening of the injection
          valve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Preferably the injection valve
          which controls injection of high pressure fluid through the
          orifice is selectively controllable in its operation. The
          injection valve may include a valve member movable against the
          action of fluid pressure in a control chamber, the fluid
          pressure in the control chamber being selectively controllable
          to control operation of the injection valve. The control
          chamber is preferably in fluid communication with the low
          pressure chamber whereby an increase in fluid pressure in the
          low pressure chamber to resist movement of the piston means
          also increases the fluid pressure in the control chamber
          resisting opening of the injection valve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the preferred embodiment the
          high pressure chamber communicates with the injection orifice
          through a delivery chamber, the high pressure fluid from the
          high pressure chamber being supplied to the delivery chamber
          through a non-return delivery valve, the non-return delivery
          valve being operable to close the delivery chamber and
          maintain in the delivery chamber a charge of fluid stored
          under pressure. Preferably the non-return delivery valve has a
          valve member having a first stage of movement in which it
          moves to stop communication from the pressure chamber to the
          delivery chamber and a second stage of movement in which the
          valve member after having completed its first stage of
          movement allows limited pressure relief in the delivery
          chamber so as to thereby reduce the fluid pressure upstream of
          the injection valve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The piston means is preferably
          movable under the action of the externally applied fluid
          pressure against the action of a main spring, the force
          applied by the main spring at least in part determining the
          externally applied fluid pressure necessary to initiate
          movement of the piston means, the injecting apparatus further
          including a delivery spring against the action of which the
          injection valve moves to allow fluid injection through the
          orifice, the strength of the delivery spring determining at
          least in part the pressure of fluid in the high pressure
          chamber necessary to open the injection valve to allow fluid
          injection through injection orifice. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Preferably there is provided a
          bleed path for high pressure fluid to bleed from the high
          pressure chamber upon movement of the piston means by a
          predetermined maximum extent, the opening of the bleed path as
          a result of said predetermined maximum movement occurring
          relieving fluid pressure in the high pressure chamber to an
          extent sufficient to stop injection of fluid through the
          injection valve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention also provides
          an injecting system comprising an injecting apparatus
          according to the invention, a fluid pressure relief path
          through which fluid pressure in the low pressure chamber can
          be controllably relieved to permit and control movement of the
          piston means, and an associated fluid pressure governor means,
          the governor means being selectively controllable to control
          the fluid pressure in the low pressure chamber by selectively
          preventing or progressively limiting relief of pressure from
          the low pressure chamber through the fluid pressure relief
          path in response to movement of the piston means. In this
          injecting system, the governor means may include a flow
          restriction means in the fluid pressure relief path to
          selectively control the cross sectional area of the fluid
          pressure relief path, the flow restriction means having an
          associated drive means so as to drive the flow restriction
          means to vary the cross sectional area of the relief path, the
          governor means further including a back pressure valve located
          in the fluid pressure relief path, downstream of the flow
          restriction means, the back pressure valve being operative to
          maintain a predetermined minimum back pressure in the fluid
          pressure relief path by only opening when the predetermined
          minimum back pressure is exceeded. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The fluid pressure relief path
          preferably includes a pressure compensating means which
          includes a restriction and varying means for varying the size
          of the restriction in response to changes in fluid pressure
          downstream thereof, the varying means being operative to
          reduce the area of the restriction to maintain a predetermined
          pressure downstream of the pressure compensating means. The
          pressure compensating means may comprise a chamber which
          communicates with the low pressure chamber, the pressure
          compensating means further including a shuttle valve
          responsive to the pressure differential between the fluid
          pressure in that chamber and a point further downstream in the
          fluid pressure relief path and being operative in response to
          an increase in the pressure differential to reduce the area of
          the restriction and thereby retard pressure relief from the
          chamber to the point further downstream. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The injecting system may further
          include a controllable damper means in communication with the
          fluid pressure relief path, the damper means including a
          movable damper member responsive to a pressure increase in the
          fluid pressure relief path to yield so as to thereby relieve
          pressure in the fluid pressure relief path, the damper means
          further including an adjustable limiting means associated with
          the movable damper member to controllably limit the extent of
          yielding movement, the limiting means thereby effectively
          determining the pressure relief provided by the damper means.
          The movable damper member may comprise a resilient damper disc
          which defines one wall of a chamber which is in communication
          with the fluid pressure relief path, the limiting means
          comprising a limiting stop which is adjustable so as to be
          contacted by the damper disc. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The injecting system in another
          embodiment may be characterised in that the fluid pressure
          relief path includes a high speed solenoid valve operative to
          open and close the fluid pressure relief path in response to
          actuation signals, the governor means being located downstream
          of the solenoid valve and being operative to adjustably limit
          in continuous increments the flow of fluid through the fluid
          pressure relief path. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Possible and preferred features of
          the present invention will now be described with particular
          reference to the accompanying drawings. However it is to be

            EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring to FIG. 1, the injector
          includes a body 10 which comprises a front body part 11 which
          can for example have a threaded end 12 for engagement in a
          threaded port associated with an engine, and a rear body part
          13. An inlet 15 is provided in the body 10, the inlet 15
          having a non-return valve 16 operated by spring 17. In use,
          fuel is supplied or induced under low pressure into the inlet
          15 sufficient to overcome the action of spring 17. The
          strength of spring 17 is not critical. The fuel pressure can
          be relatively low so that high pressure fuel lines are not
          required. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An outlet 20 has an associated
          non-return valve 21 acting by means of spring 22, the strength
          of which is not critical. With this arrangement, fuel can
          continuously be pumped or induced under low pressure into
          inlet 15, through passage 25 and out through outlet 20. This
          continuous fuel flow can provide cooling although
          supplementary cooling could be provided. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The injector includes a low
          pressure piston 30 slidable in the front body 11 when engine
          cylinder pressure acts on the front face 31. Compression ring
          32 and oil scraper ring 33 are provided for conventional
          purposes.. Screwed to the low pressure piston 30 is a high
          pressure piston 35. The piston assembly 30, 35 moves within
          the body 10 against the action of main spring 36. The force
          applied by main spring 36 determines, in part, whether the
          piston assembly 30, 35 will move under the action of cylinder
          pressure on face 31. Also, the main spring 36 is located in a
          low pressure chamber 37 which is in fluid communication
          through space 38 with the passage 25 and through valve 21 with
          the outlet 20 so that the fluid pressure in low pressure
          chamber 37 resisting movement of the piston assembly 30, 35
          can be relatively low, subject to control to be described
          later. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A possible variation of the
          preferred construction illustrated and described is the
          replacement of the main spring 36 with a pneumatic or other
          biasing means. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The high pressure piston 35 has an
          extension 40 of relatively small cross sectional area which
          travels within a bore 41 provided within a high pressure body
          42. The high pressure body 42 comprises a base section 43 and
          a high pressure barrel 44 in which the extension 40 travels.
          The base section 43 and high pressure barrel 44 are secured
          together and define a high pressure chamber 45 in which fuel
          is compressed to high pressure by the extension 40 of the high
          pressure piston 35. Non-return valve 46 operated by a spring
          47 allows fuel to enter the high pressure chamber 45 from the
          passage 25 upon retraction of the high pressure piston
          extension 40 in the bore 41. The strength of spring 47 is not
          critical. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the extension 40 there is
          provided a bleed bore 50 and extending through the high
          pressure barrel 44 is a bleed bore 51 which opens into the low
          pressure chamber 37. If the stroke of the piston assembly 30,
          35 is sufficient for the bleed bore 50 to align with the bleed
          bore 51, the fuel within the high pressure chamber 45 is
          immediately placed in communication with the low pressure
          chamber 37 and the fuel pressure in high pressure chamber 45
          will immediately drop so that there will be insufficient
          pressure for fuel injection to continue as will be described
          later. Thus the longitudinal separation between the bleed bore
          50 and the bleed bore 51 effectively defines the maximum fuel
          charge that can be injected during one stroke of the piston
          assembly 30, 35 and this, in turn, effectively limits the
          speed of running of the associated engine to a predetermined
          maximum determined by the maximum fuel charge. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Running longitudinally through the
          extension 40 of the high pressure piston 35 is a fuel passage
          55 along which pressurised fuel from the high pressure chamber
          45 travels as the piston assembly 30, 35 moves under the
          action of the cylinder pressure. The fuel passes a non-return
          delivery valve 56 which is shown resting against shoulder 57
          under the action of spring 58. In operation, high pressure
          fuel moves valve 56 away from shoulder 57 against the action
          of spring 58. Fuel flows past the valve 56 only when it has
          moved sufficiently for the shoulder 59 of the valve to move
          past the end of passage 60 formed on the inside surface of the
          high pressure piston 35. With this arrangement, when delivery
          valve 56 is closing, fuel flow past the valve 56 is stopped
          when the shoulder 59 reaches the end of the passage 60, after
          which the valve 56 continues to move by a further limited
          extent until the valve 56 reaches shoulder 57. This continued
          movement of valve 56 after the valve has closed off fuel flow
          relieves pressure on the downstream side of the valve 56 for a
          purpose which will be described later. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The low pressure piston 30 has a
          delivery chamber 65 into which high pressure fuel is
          introduced through bore 66 provided in the spacer 67. At
          forward end of the delivery chamber 65 is a delivery orifice
          68 provided in an insert 69. The orifice 68 is shown closed by
          needle type delivery valve 70 which seats against the insert
          69 under the action of delivery spring 71. When the pressure
          of fuel in the delivery chamber 65 is sufficiently great, the
          needle valve 70 moves against the action of delivery spring 71
          and opens the orifice 68 and fuel is injected through the
          orifice 68 into the associated engine cylinder. The
          commencement of injection through orifice 68 causes an
          immediate drop in fuel pressure in delivery chamber 65 and the
          needle valve 70 will tend to close the orifice 68 again. This,
          in turn, will allow pressure in delivery chamber 65 to rise
          and again open needle valve 70. This process continues so that
          the needle valve 70 opens and closes the orifice 68 at high
          speed. This action is known as "buzzing" of the delivery
          needle valve 70 and causes the fuel to be injected through
          orifice 68 in waves and this is believed to improve fuel
          combustion efficiency. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The needle valve 70 has a shank 75
          which moves within a guide 76. The end 77 of the shank 75
          remote from the delivery orifice 68 closes a control chamber
          78. Control chamber 78 communicates through (aligned) bores
          79, 80 provided in the spacer 67 and low pressure piston 30
          respectively and through the space 81 around the outside of
          the low pressure piston 30 with the low pressure chamber 37.
          Thus the control chamber 78 is normally in communication with
          low pressure fuel allowing the needle valve 70 and shank 75 to
          move away from the insert 69 to open the orifice 68 under the
          pressure of fuel in the delivery chamber 65. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown
          an accelerator or governor means which enables control of the
          flow of fuel on the downstream side of the injector. In
          particular, in use, the governor means shown in FIG. 2
          comprises a body 85 having a bore 86 which is in communication
          with the outlet 20 of the injector. The downstream end of the
          bore 86 is provided with a chamfered seat 87. Longitudinally
          selectively movable within the bore 86 is a governor 90 which
          has a complementary chamfered shoulder 91 which can close
          against seat 87 to completely close bore 86. The governor 90
          has a shank 92 which extends into the bore 86 and is a close
          fit within the bore. The shank 92 has a groove 93 which tapers
          from the shoulder 91 to the upstream end 94 of the shank 92.
          The fuel can flow into the bore 86 along the groove 93 and
          between the shoulder 91 and seat 87 when the governor 90 is
          retracted longitudinally in the direction of arrow A. If the
          governor 90 is retracted only slightly from the seat 87, flow
          along the groove 93 is significantly restricted since the fuel
          must flow through the shallowest end of the groove 93 where
          the seat 87 meets the bore 86 at point 95. If the governor 90
          is retracted further in the direction of arrow A, greater flow
          past point 95 is possible because of the deepening of the
          groove 93 towards the end 94. Thus the selective retraction
          and insertion of the governor 90 from and into the bore 86
          enables control of the pressure in low pressure chamber 37 of
          the injector, which in turn, can control the stroke of the
          piston assembly 30, 35. If the governor 90 is moved to contact
          the shoulder 91 against the seat 87, the fuel flow through
          outlet 20 of the injector is prevented and this will
          hydraulically lock the piston assembly 30, 35 against movement
          by blocking the pressure relief path for fuel from low
          pressure chamber 37. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The movement of the governor 90 in
          FIG. 2 can be achieved by any suitable means such as a
          mechanical adjustment of the position of governor 90.
          Alternatively the governor 90 could be moved by a DC electric
          motor or linear motor enabling electronic control of the fuel
          injection. In this way, it is possible to infinitely vary the
          fuel injection by controlling governor 90 in a continuous
          manner, thereby controlling continuously the low pressure side
          of the injector which in turn enables control of the point in
          an operating cycle at which movement of the piston assembly
          30, 35 is allowed to commence. In general terms, the hydraulic
          control of the low pressure side of the piston assembly 30, 35
          of the injector enables precise control of the point of
          commencement of the stroke of the piston assembly 30, 35 which
          controls the amount of fuel injected, up to a maximum charge
          determined by the spacing of the bleed bore 50 and 51. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In operation of the injector in an
          internal combustion engine, the increasing pressure on the
          front face 31 of the low pressure piston 30 during the
          compression state of the engine will tend to move the piston
          assembly 30, 35 against the action of both the main spring 36
          and the fluid pressure in chamber 37. If the pressure relief
          from the low pressure chamber 37 through outlet 20 is
          permitted, the piston assembly 30, 35 retracts to compress
          fuel in high pressure chamber 45. The fuel flows through fuel
          passage 55, past delivery valve 56 and into delivery chamber
          65. The pressure in chamber 65 causes the needle valve 70 to
          open against the action of both delivery spring 71 and the
          pressure in low pressure chamber 37 which, in turn, is in
          communication with control chamber 78 so that fuel injection
          through orifice 68 commences. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Initially, fuel will be injected in
          relatively large droplets since the pressure in the engine
          cylinder is still relatively low. However, in the case of a
          compression ignition engine, immediately ignition of the fuel
          in the cylinder occurs, there is a rapid increase in cylinder
          pressure which acts on face 31 of the piston 30. This pressure
          jump immediately causes a multiplication of the fuel injection
          pressure so that the fuel being injected through orifice 68 at
          a greatly increased pressure will emerge in much smaller
          droplets which improves the combustion efficiency. The initial
          injection pressure jump may be from 4000 psi to 25000 psi. The
          ratio of injection pressure to input pressure may be between
          6:l and 12:1. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is possible to control the
          proportion of the total fuel charge which is injected at the
          initial relatively low pressure by adjustment of the strengths
          of the main spring 36 and the delivery spring 71. For example,
          increasing the strength of the main spring 36 retards the
          point of movement of the piston assembly 30, 35 thus delaying
          the commencement of injection and reducing the proportion of
          the fuel which is injected during the initial low pressure
          injection stage prior to ignition. By adjustment of these
          spring forces, it is possible to affect the efficiency of
          combustion and hence control emissions, e.g. for different
          cylinder sizes. The ratio of the high and low pressures of
          injection is also controllable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The maximum fuel charge is
          determined by the spacing of the bleed bores 50, 51 which
          effectively also provides a maximum engine speed limiter. In
          particular, when the bleed bores 50 and 51 align, the fuel
          pressure in the high pressure chamber 45 is immediately
          relieved through the bleed bores 50, 51 and this pressure drop
          is immediately conveyed to the delivery chamber 65 so that the
          needle valve 70 immediately closes. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The external control of the
          pressure relief through the outlet 20 of the injector, e.g. by
          means of the governor means shown in FIG. 2, not only controls
          the point of opening movement of the piston assembly 30, 35
          but also controls the low pressure side in chamber 37 during
          an injection operation. If the pressure relief through outlet
          20 is retarded, the movement of piston assembly 30, 35 is
          limited by the relief of pressure in the low pressure chamber
          37 and also the opening movement of the needle valve 70 is
          resisted by the retarded relief of pressure in control chamber
          78 acting against face 77 of the shank 75 of the needle valve
          70. Thus low pressure side hydraulic lock up controls
          termination of the fuel injection operation. Alternatively,
          the termination of the injection operation occurs when the
          maximum fuel charge is injected and the bleed bores 50, 51
          align and cause an immediate high pressure side pressure drop.
          In either case, the delivery needle valve 70 closes the
          orifice 68. The delivery valve 56 also will immediately move
          towards its closed position under the action of spring 58 so
          that the shoulder 59 reaches the end of passage 60 thus
          closing off communication between the high pressure chamber 45
          and the delivery chamber 65. Because the delivery valve 56
          continues to move beyond the point at which shoulder 59
          reaches the end of passage 60, the fluid pressure in delivery
          chamber 65 can continue to be relieved preventing opening of
          needle valve 70 until high pressure is again built up in
          delivery chamber 65. These combined actions of hydraulic lock
          up of the low pressure side or high pressure side pressure
          relief, together with the two stage movement of the delivery
          valve 56 ensure immediate and positive termination of the fuel
          injection. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The injector shown in FIG. 3 is in
          most respects the same as the injector shown in FIG. 1 and the
          same reference numerals are used for corresponding parts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Different features in FIG. 3
          include the modified needle valve 70 which, instead of a
          conical tip, includes a blunt nose portion 70a which
          substantially fills the "sack" 72 which is a small space
          immediately upstream of the orifice 68. The fuel remaining in
          the sack 72 in prior injectors was sometimes a cause of
          continued fuel introduction into the cylinder after the
          desired cut off point. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Also in FIG. 3, the spacer 67 is
          provided with a non-return valve 100 arranged to allow the
          flow from the control chamber 78 to the low pressure chamber
          37 but preventing a shock loading at any time from being
          transmitted into the chamber 78. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In FIG. 3, the inlet 15 is shown in
          a different location with a relatively small inlet valve 16
          allowing fuel under low pressure to pass from the inlet 15 to
          an inlet manifold 102 which encircles the body 10 and enables
          fluid to pass from the annular manifold space 103 through
          passages 104 to the low pressure chamber 37. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Also in FIG. 3, there is provided a
          high speed solenoid 105 having an associated valve member 106
          arranged to selectively close the outlet 20. The solenoid 105
          can be energised under the control of an electrical switching
          means 107 by means of which the time of commencement of
          injection is controllable and also the length of the period of
          injection is also controllable. In particular, the opening of
          the valve 106 by solenoid 105 under the control of the control
          means 107 enables the injection to commence. Prior to opening
          of the valve 106 the piston assembly 30, 35 is effectively
          hydraulically locked against movement. Similarly, closing of
          the valve 106 will again lock the piston assembly 30, 35
          against movement thereby terminating the injection. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Downstream of the valve 106 there
          is an outlet port 110 through which pressure relieving flow
          can take place when the valve 106 is open. Associated with the
          outlet port 110 or downstream thereof there is preferably
          provided an adjustable flow restriction means to enable
          selective control of the rate of pressure relieving flow
          through the outlet port 110, the adjustable flow restriction
          comprising a governor arrangement such as shown in FIG. 2. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 4 showns an alternative
          injector control arrangement located at the rear body 13 of
          the injector, although the control arrangement may be a
          separate unit connected in the fluid pressure relief path from
          the low pressure chamber 37. In the embodiment in FIG. 4,
          pressure relief from the chamber 37 is provided through a
          fluid pressure relief path comprising a first chamber 120
          which communicates with an intermediate chamber 121 through a
          pressure compensating means 122 comprising a restriction 123
          (FIG. 5) shown in the form of a slot provided within sleeve
          124. Inside the sleeve there is provided a shuttle valve
          member 125 having a head 126 which progressively closes or
          opens the slot 123 as the shuttle valve 125 moves within the
          sleeve 124. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The fluid pressure relief path also
          includes a downstream low pressure chamber 130. The fluid
          pressure in chamber 130, together with the force of spring 131
          opposes movement of the shuttle valve 125 under the influence
          of fluid pressure from the chamber 120 passed to the
          intermediate chamber 121. However if the pressure differential
          between intermediate chamber 121 and low pressure chamber 130
          rises sufficiently, the shuttle valve 125 will move and the
          head 126 will restrict the pressure relieving flow through the
          slot 123 thereby enabling the pressure in the intermediate
          chamber 121 to reduce by means of flow to low pressure chamber
          130. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Interposed in the fluid pressure
          relief path between the intermediate chamber 121 and the low
          pressure chamber 130 is a selectively controllable flow
          restriction means 135 which comprises a needle valve 136
          having a tapered nose portion 137 located in the passage 138
          extending between intermediate chamber 121 and low pressure
          chamber 130. The needle valve 136 is selectively movable by
          means of electrical or mechanical control means 139 so as to
          enable selective control of the rate of pressure relief
          through the passage 138. This, in turn, enables control of the
          injection rate. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Downstream of the flow restriction
          means 135 there is a non-return valve 140 which functions to
          maintain a minimum back pressure determined by the force of
          spring 141 which is a function of the spring itself and the
          position of adjustable seat 142 for the spring 141. At low
          idle speeds of an associated engine, the valve 140 determines
          the minimum back pressure. At higher engine speeds, the valve
          140 remains open substantially all of the time. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The system shown in FIG. 4 also
          provides a controllable damper means 150, illustrated more
          clearly in FIG. 6. The damper means 150 includes a movable
          damper member 151 illustrated as a damper disc mounted in a
          damper chamber 152 which is in communication through duct 153
          with the intermediate chamber 121. The damper disc 151 yields
          resiliently upon an increasing pressure in the intermediate
          chamber 121. There is an adjustable stop member 155 which is
          adjustable by means of set screw 156 to enable selective
          setting of the limit of resilient movement of the damper disc
          151. By adjusting the position of the stop member 155, the
          idle setting or speed of an associated engine can be
          effectively controlled. In particular, a relatively large gap
          between the stop member 155 and the damper disc 151 enables a
          larger stroke of the piston assembly 30, 35 before the other
          flow limiting means or pressure relief limiting means become
          effective, thereby enabling a higher idle speed to be set. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The embodiment of the injector
          system shown in FIGS. 4 to 6 and described above provides a
          great deal of control over the operation of the injector,
          including control over the timing of the start and end of
          injection, the rate of injection, idle speed, and even
          variation in rate of injection within a single injection
          cycle. The greater degree of control that is possible makes
          the injector system particularly suitable for direct fired
          internal combustion engines. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The construction and arrangement of
          the injectors and associated controllers illustrated and
          described with reference to the drawings enables accurate and
          repeatable control of the point of commencement of the
          injection, accurate and repeatable control of the charge of
          liquid which is injected during each injection cycle, and
          accurate and repeatable point of termination of the injection.
          The three stage positive termination of injection makes the
          injector suitable for high speed two stroke engines. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Automatic pollution control is one
          benefit of using the cylinder pressure to develop the
          injection pressure. In particular, if the engine cylinder
          develops a fault, such as a broken piston ring, leading to a
          drop in pressure in the cylinder, the pressure drop will
          immediately prevent or at least reduce the charge of fuel that
          the injector will introduce into that cylinder. Thus the
          engine will exhaust less unburnt fuel compared to an engine
          where a full charge continues to be injected into a faulty
          cylinder. This compensation also occurs in the case of normal
          wear of components so that pollution reduction and wear
          compensation results. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Another benefit of the injector is
          that it provides automatic timing adjustment. In particular,
          as an associated engine increases in running speed, ideally,
          the commencement of injection should be advanced in the
          operating cycle since the fuel needs a predetermined minimum
          time to burn completely regardless of the speed of the engine.
          With the injector of the present invention, as the engine
          piston commences the compression cycle, there is a faster
          build up of pressure in the cylinder at higher engine speeds
          since the heat is not escaping as quickly from the engine as
          at lower speeds. This more rapid increase in pressure will
          automatically advance the commencement of injection to earlier
          points in the engine cycle. This advancement can be in excess
          of 15.degree. from initial setting to the point of injection
          at maximum engine speed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A further advantage of the
          preferred injectors described and illustrated is the lowered
          average combustion overall pressure which results from the new
          combustion mode. This in turn can lead to the use of lighter
          components. The "new combustion mode" results from the
          different phases of the combustion of the fuel. If a pressure
          versus time graph for a conventional engine were shown, the
          graph rises sharply to a peak and drops rapidly. With the
          injectors of the preferred embodiment, the control of the
          injected droplet sizes and the injection pressures enables
          control of the combustion process so that the pressure time
          graph can have a relatively flat plateau so that the area
          under the graph which relates to the work can be the same as
          conventional engines but the lower maximum pressure leads to
          less stress in the motor and the ability to use smaller or
          lighter components. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Because the injectors described and
          illustrated requires low levels of lubrication due to the
          absence of bearing components, the injectors will function
          with a no wax diesel fuel making it possible to work in cold
          climates. With careful material selection, LPG can be directly
          used. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A further advantage of the
          preferred injector construction and operation is the ability
          to automatically prime the injector for a subsequent
          operation. By closing the external governor means, there is a
          hydraulic lock up of the low pressure side, and fuel will be
          stored in the delivery chamber 65 since the fuel cannot be
          released through the orifice 68 or through the delivery valve
          56. Thus, when the associated engine is to be re-started, the
          first compression cycle of the associated engine will enable
          fuel under pressure in the delivery chamber 65 to be injected
          for commencing normal operation of the engine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the particular construction of
          injectors shown in the drawings, metal to metal contacts are
          used to provide sealing between immovable parts. For example,
          the front body 11 and rear body 13 are connected together with
          metal to metal contact between a sharp step 96 provided on the
          rear body 13 and a chamfered face 97 provided on the front
          body 11. This also applies to connections between the spacer
          67 and the low pressure piston 30, between the spacer 67 and
          the high pressure piston 35, and between the high pressure
          barrel 44 and the base section 43. These connections are
          modified "Lenz ring seats" and provide good sealing under high
          pressures. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The valves, including the inlet
          valve 16, outlet valve 21, non-return valve 46, delivery valve
          56 and the needle valve 70 preferably have sealing contact
          between the valve members and associated seats with an
          internal angle less than 90.degree., and preferably at about
          60.degree.. For example, the included angle in the point of
          the needle valve 70 is preferably about 60.degree.. This
          relatively shallow angle of seating has been found to provide
          good sealing at a wide range of fluid pressures. </p>
