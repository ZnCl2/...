      A solid-state electrical generator including at least one
      permanent magnet, magnetically coupled to a ferromagnetic core
      provided with at least one hole penetrating its volume; the
      hole(s) and magnet(s) being placed such that the hole(s)
      penetrating the ferromagnetic core's volume intercept flux from
      the permanent magnet(s) coupled into the ferromagnetic core. A
      first wire coil is wound around the ferromagnetic core for the
      purpose of moving the coupled permanent magnet flux within the
      ferromagnetic core. A second wire is routed through the hole(s)
      penetrating the volume of the ferromagnetic core, for the purpose
      of intercepting this moving magnetic flux, thereby inducing an
      output electromotive force.; A changing voltage applied to the
      first wire coil causes coupled permanent magnet flux to move
      within the core relative to the hole(s) penetrating the core
      volume, thus inducing electromotive force along wire(s) passing
      through the hole(s) in the ferromagnetic core. The mechanical
      action of an electrical generator is thereby synthesized without
      use of moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method and device for generating
      electrical power using solid state means.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has long been known that moving a magnetic field across a wire
      will generate an electromotive force (EMF), or voltage, along the
      wire. When this wire is connected in an electrical closed circuit,
      in order to perform work, an electric current is driven through
      this closed circuit by the induced electromotive force.<br>
      <br>
      It has also long been known that this resulting electric current
      causes the closed circuit to become encircled with a secondary,
      induced magnetic field, whose polarity opposes the primary
      magnetic field that first induced the EMF. This magnetic
      opposition creates mutual repulsion as a moving magnet moves
      toward such a closed circuit and attraction as that moving magnet
      then moves away from the closed circuit. Both these actions tend
      to slow, or “drag” the progress of the moving magnet generating
      the EMF, causing the electric generator to act as a magnetic
      brake, in direct proportion to the amount of electric current
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      Gas engines, hydroelectric dams and steam-fed turbines have
      historically been used to overcome this magnetic braking action
      occurring within mechanical electric generators. A large amount of
      mechanical power is ultimately required to produce a large amount
      of electrical power, since the magnetic braking interaction
      resulting from induced electrical current is generally
      proportional to the amount of power being generated.<br>
      <br>
      There has been a long felt need for a generator which reduces this
      well-known magnetic braking interaction, while nevertheless
      generating useful electric power. When the magnetic fields within
      a generator are caused to move and interact efficiently electric
      power can be supplied with far greater economy. Improving power
      generating and conversion efficiencies also increases the power
      capability of a device thereby, inter alia, providing a mechanism
      to reduce the size and weight of the generating device. Smaller
      and higher power density devices are particularly useful in
      applications such as aviation, automotive, and portable
      electronics including hand held devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has long been known that the source of the magnetism within a
      permanent magnet is a spinning electric current within
      ferromagnetic atoms of certain elements, persisting indefinitely
      in accord with well-defined quantum rules. This atomic current
      encircles each atom, thereby causing each atom to emit a magnetic
      field, as a miniature electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      This atomic current does not exist in magnets alone. It also
      exists in ordinary metallic iron, and in any element or metallic
      alloy that can be “magnetized”, that is, exhibits ferromagnetism.
      All ferromagnetic atoms and “magnetic metals” contain such quantum
      atomic electromagnets.<br>
      <br>
      In specific ferromagnetic materials, the orientation axis of each
      atomic electromagnet is flexible. The orientation of magnetic flux
      within, as well as external to the material, easily pivots. Such
      materials are referred to as magnetically “soft”, due to this
      magnetic flexibility.<br>
      <br>
      Permanent magnet materials are magnetically “hard”. The
      orientation axis of each atomic electromagnet is fixed in place
      within a rigid crystal structure. The total magnetic field
      produced by these atoms cannot easily move. This constraint
      permanently aligns the field of ordinary magnets, hence the name
      “permanent”.<br>
      <br>
      The axis of circular current flow in one ferromagnetic atom can
      direct the axis of magnetism within another ferromagnetic atom,
      through a process known as spin exchange. This gives a soft
      magnetic material, like raw iron, the useful ability to aim,
      focus, and redirect the magnetic field emitted from a magnetically
      hard permanent magnet.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, a permanent magnet's rigid field is sent
      into a magnetically flexible, “soft” magnetic material. The
      permanent magnet's apparent location, observed from points within
      the magnetically soft material, will effectively move, vibrate,
      and appear to shift position when the magnetization of the soft
      magnetic material is modulated by ancillary means (much like the
      sun, viewed while underwater, appears to move when the water is
      agitated). By this mechanism, the motion required for generation
      of electricity can be synthesized within a soft ferromagnetic
      material, without requiring physical movement or an applied
      mechanical force.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is believed to synthesize virtual motion of
      magnets and their magnetic fields thereby providing highly
      efficient energy conversion. The present invention describes an
      electrical generator wherein magnetic braking phenomena, known as
      expressions of Lenz's Law, do not oppose the means by which the
      magnetic field energy is caused to move. This synthesized magnetic
      motion is aided by forces generated in accordance with Lenz's Law,
      in order to aid the synthesized magnetic motion, instead of
      physical “magnetic braking”. Because of this novel magnetic
      interaction, the solid-state static generator of the present
      invention provides a highly efficient energy conversion apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      So that the above-recited features of the present invention can be
      understood in detail, a more particular description of the
      invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to
      various embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended
      drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings
      illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are
      therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 depicts a partially exploded view of an embodiment of an
      electric generator of this invention. The parts have been
      numbered, with the numbering convention applied to FIGS. 1, 2, and
      3.<br>
      <br>
      Numeral 1 represents a permanent magnet with its North pole
      pointing inward toward the soft ferromagnetic core of the device.
      Similarly, numeral 2 indicates permanent magnets of preferably the
      same shape and composition, with their South poles aimed inward
      toward the opposite side, or opposite surface of the device. The
      letters “S” and “N” denote these respective magnetic poles in the
      drawing. Other magnetic polarities and configurations may be used
      with success; the pattern shown merely illustrative of one
      efficient mode of adding magnets to the core.<br>
      <br>
      The magnets may be formed of any polarized magnetic material. In
      order of descending effectiveness, the most desirable
      permanent-magnet materials are Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NIB) magnets,
      Samarium Cobalt magnets, AlNiCo alloy magnets, or “ceramic”
      strontium-, barium- or lead-ferrite magnets. A primary factor
      determining permanent magnet material composition is the magnetic
      flux strength of the particular material type. In an embodiment of
      the invention, these magnets may also be substituted with one or
      more electromagnets producing the required magnetic flux. In
      another embodiment of the invention, a superimposed DC current
      bias can be applied to the output wire to generate the required
      magnetic flux, in substitution of, or in conjunction with said
      permanent magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Numeral 3 indicates the magnetic core. This core is a critical
      member of the generator, determining the characteristics of output
      power capacity, optimal magnet type, electrical impedance, and
      operating frequency range. This core may be any shape, composed of
      any ferromagnetic substance, formed by any process (sintering,
      casting, adhesive bonding, tape winding, etc). A wide spectrum of
      geometries, materials, and processes are known in the art of
      magnetic cores. Effective common materials include, but are not
      limited to, amorphous metal alloys (such as that sold under the
      trademark designation “Metglas” by Metglas Inc., Conway S.C.),
      nanocrystalline alloys, manganese and zinc ferrites as well as
      ferrites of any suitable element including any combination of
      magnetically “hard” and “soft” ferrites, powdered metals and
      ferromagnetic alloys, laminations of cobalt and/or iron, and
      silicon-iron “electrical steel”. This invention successfully
      utilizes any ferromagnetic material, while functioning as claimed.
      In an embodiment of the invention, and for the purpose of
      illustration, a circular “toroid” core is illustrated. In an
      embodiment of the invention, the composition may be bonded iron
      powder, commonly available from many manufacturers.<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of core type, the core is prepared with holes, through
      which wires may pass, which have been drilled or formed to
      penetrate the core's ferromagnetic volume. The toroidal core 3
      shown includes radial holes pointing toward a common center. If,
      for example stiff wire rods were to be inserted through each of
      these holes, these wires would meet at the center point of the
      core, producing an appearance similar to a spoke wheel. If a
      square or rectangular core (not illustrated) is used instead,
      these holes are preferably oriented parallel to the core's flat
      sides, causing stiff rods passed through the holes to form a
      square grid pattern, as the rods cross each other in the interior
      “window” area framed by the core. While in other embodiments of
      the invention, these holes may take any possible orientation or
      patterns of orientation within the scope of the present generator,
      a simple row of radial holes is illustrated herein as one example.<br>
      <br>
      Numeral 4 depicts a wire or bundle of wires, i.e. output wire 4,
      that pick-up and carry the generator's output power. Typically
      this wire is composed of insulated copper, though other output
      mediums such as aluminum, iron, dielectric material, polymers, and
      semiconducting materials may be substituted. It may be seen in
      FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 that wire 4, which serves as an output medium,
      passes alternately through neighboring holes formed in core 3. The
      path taken by wire 4 undulates, passing in an opposite direction
      through each adjacent hole. If an even number of holes is used,
      the wire will emerge on the same side of the core it first entered
      on, once all holes are filled. The resulting pair of trailing
      leads may be twisted together or similarly terminated, forming the
      output terminals of the generator shown at Numeral 5. Output wire
      4 may also make multiple passes through each hole in the core.
      Though the winding pattern is not necessarily undulatory; this
      basic form is shown by way of example. Many effective connection
      styles exist; this illustration shows the simplest. All successful
      connection methods pass wire 4 at some point through the holes in
      the core.<br>
      <br>
      Numeral 6 in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 points to a partial illustration of
      the input winding, or inductive coil used to shift the permanent
      magnets' fields within the core. Typically, this wire coil
      encircles the core, wrapping around it. For the toroidal core
      presented, input coil 6 resembles the outer windings of a typical
      toroidal inductor, a common electrical component. For the sake of
      clarity, only a few turns of coil 6 are shown in each of drawing
      FIGS. 1, 2, and 3. In practice, this coil may cover the entire
      core, or specific sections of the core, including or not including
      the magnets, while remaining within scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows the same representative generator of FIG. 1, looking
      transparently “down” through it from above, so the relative
      positions of the core holes (dotted lines), the path of the output
      wire, and magnet positions (as shaded areas) are made clear.<br>
      <br>
      The generator shown uses a core with 8 radially drilled holes. The
      spacing between these illustrative holes is equal. As shown, each
      hole is displaced 45 degrees from the next. All holes' centers lay
      along a common plane; this imaginary plane is centered half-way
      along the core's vertical thickness. Cores of any shape and size
      may include as few as two, or as many as hundreds of holes, and a
      similar number of magnets. Other variations exist, such as
      generators with multiple rows of holes, zigzag and diagonal
      patterns, or output wire 4 molded directly into the core material.
      In any case, the basic magnetic interaction shown in FIG. 3 occurs
      for each hole in the core, as detailed below.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the same design, viewed broadside. The curvature of
      the core has been flattened to the page for the purpose of
      illustration. The magnets are represented schematically,
      protruding from core top and bottom, with arrows indicating the
      direction of magnetic flux—arrow heads pointing north, tails
      south.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, the free, unattached polar ends of the generator's
      magnets may be left as-is, in open air, or provided with a common
      ferromagnetic path linking unused North and South poles together,
      as a magnetic “ground”. This common return path is typically made
      of steel, iron or similar material, taking the form of a ferrous
      enclosure housing the device. It may serve the additional purpose
      of a protecting chassis. The magnetic return may also be another
      ferromagnetic core in repetition of the present invention, forming
      a stack or layered series of generators, sharing common magnets
      between generator cores. Any such additions are without direct
      bearing on the functional principle of the generator itself, and
      have therefore been omitted from these illustrations.<br>
      <br>
      Two example flux diagrams are given in FIG. 3. Each example is
      shown in a space between schematically depicted partial input
      coils 6. A positive or negative polarity marker indicates the
      direction of input current, applied through the input coil. This
      applied current produces “modulating” magnetic flux, which is used
      to synthesize motion of the permanent magnets, and is shown as a
      double-tailed horizontal arrow (a) along the core 3. Each example
      shows this double-tailed arrow (a) pointing to the right or the
      left depending on the polarity of applied current.<br>
      <br>
      In either case, vertical flux entering the core (b, 3) from the
      external permanent magnets (1, 2) is swept along, within the core,
      by the direction of the double-tailed arrow representing the input
      coil's magnetic flux (a). These curved arrows (b) in the space
      between the magnets and holes can be seen to shift or bend
      (a-&gt;b), as if they were streams or jets of air subject to a
      changing wind (a).<br>
      <br>
      The resulting sweeping motion of the permanent magnets' fields
      causes their flux (b) to brush back and forth over the holes and
      wire 4 passing through these holes. Just as in a mechanical
      generator, when magnetic flux brushes or “cuts” sideways across a
      conductor in this way, EMF or voltage is induced. By connecting an
      electrical load across the ends of this wire conductor (Numeral 5,
      in FIGS. 1, 2) a current is allowed to flow through the load in a
      closed circuit, delivering electrical power able to perform work.
      Input of an alternating current across the input coil 6 generates
      an alternating magnetic field (a) causing the fields of permanent
      magnets 1, and 2 to shift (b) within the core 3, inducing
      electrical power through a load (attached to terminals 5), as if
      the fixed magnets (1,2) themselves were physically moving.
      However, no mechanical motion is present.<br>
      <br>
      In a mechanical generator, induced current powering an electrical
      load returns back through output wire 4 creating a secondary
      induced magnetic field, exerting forces which substantially oppose
      the original magnetic field inducing the original EMF. Since load
      currents induce their own, secondary magnetic fields opposing the
      original act of induction in this way, the source of the original
      induction requires additional energy to restore itself and
      continue generating electricity. In mechanical generators, the
      energy-inducing motion of the generator's magnetic fields is being
      physically actuated, requiring a strong prime mover (such as a
      steam turbine) to restore the EMF-generating magnetic fields'
      motion, against the braking effect of the output-induced magnetic
      fields (the induced field (c), and the inducing field (b)),
      destructively in mutual opposition. It is this inductive
      opposition which ultimately must be overcome by physical force,
      which is commonly produced by consumption of other energy
      resources.<br>
      <br>
      The generator of the present invention makes use of the induced,
      secondary magnetic field in such a way as to not cause opposition,
      resulting in efficient magnetic field motion. Because the magnetic
      fields do not act to destroy one another in mutual opposition, the
      present invention is a highly efficient energy conversion
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The present generator's induced magnetic field, resulting from
      electric current flowing through the load and returning through
      output wire 4, is that of a closed loop encircling each hole in
      the core admitting the output conductor or conductive medium (4,
      c). The present generator's induced magnetic fields create
      magnetic flux in the form of closed loops within the ferromagnetic
      core. The magnetic field “encircles” each hole in the core
      carrying output wire 4, similar to the threads of a screw
      “encircling” the shaft of the screw.<br>
      <br>
      Within this generator, the magnetic field from output medium or
      wire 4 immediately encircles each hole formed in the core (c)
      carrying this medium or wire 4. Since wire 4 may take an opposing
      direction through each neighboring hole, the direction of the
      resulting magnetic field will likewise be opposite. The directions
      of arrows (b) and (c) are, at each hole, opposing, headed in
      opposite directions, since (b) is the inducing flux and (c) is the
      induced flux, each opposing one another while generating
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      However, this magnetic opposition is effectively directed against
      the permanent magnets that are injecting their flux into the core,
      but not the source of the alternating magnetic input field 6. In
      the present solid state generator, induced output flux (4, c) is
      directed to oppose the permanent magnets (1, 2) not the input flux
      source (6, a) that is synthesizing the virtual motion of those
      magnets (1, 2) by its magnetizing action on core 3.<br>
      <br>
      The present generator employs magnets as the source of motive
      pressure driving the generator, since they are the entity being
      opposed or “pushed against” by the opposing reaction induced by
      output current which is powering a load. Experiments show that
      high-quality permanent magnets can be magnetically “pushed
      against” in this way for very long periods of time, before
      becoming demagnetized or “spent”.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates inducing representative flux arrows (b)
      directed oppositely against induced representative flux (c). In
      materials typically used to form core 3, fields flowing in
      mutually opposite directions tend to cancel each other, just as
      positive and negative numbers of equal magnitude sum to zero.<br>
      <br>
      On the remaining side of each hole, opposite the permanent magnet,
      no mutual opposition takes place. Induced flux (c) caused by the
      generator load currents remains present; however, inducing flux
      from the permanent magnets (b) is not present since no magnet is
      present, on this side, to source the necessary flux. This leaves
      the induced flux (c) encircling the hole, as well as input flux
      (a) from the input coils 6, continuing its path along the core, on
      either side of each hole.<br>
      <br>
      On the side of each core hole where a magnet is present, action
      (b) and reaction (c) magnetic flux substantially cancel and
      annihilate, being oppositely directed within the core. On the
      other side of each hole, where no magnet is present, input flux
      (a) and reaction flux (c) share a common direction. Magnetic flux
      thereby adds together in these zones, where induced magnetic flux
      (c) aids the input flux (a). This is the reverse of typical
      generator action, where induced flux (c) is typically opposing the
      “input” flux originating the induction.<br>
      <br>
      Since the magnetic interaction herein is a combination of magnetic
      flux opposition and magnetic flux acceleration, there is no longer
      an overall magnetic braking, or total opposition effect. The
      braking and opposition is counterbalanced by a simultaneous
      magnetic acceleration within the core. Since mechanical motion is
      absent, the equivalent electrical effect ranges from idling, or
      absence of opposition, to a strengthening and overall acceleration
      of the electrical input signal (within coils 6). Proper selection
      of the permanent magnet (1, 2) material and flux density, core 3
      material magnetic characteristics, core hole pattern and spacing,
      and output medium connection technique create embodiments wherein
      the present generator will display an absence of electrical
      loading at the input and/or an overall amplification of the input
      signal. This ultimately causes less input energy to be required in
      order to work the generator. Therefore, as increasing amounts of
      energy are withdrawn from the generator as output power performing
      useful work, decreasing amounts of energy are generally required
      to operate it. This process endures, working against the permanent
      magnets (1, 2) until they are demagnetized.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of this invention, FIG. 4 illustrates a typical
      operating circuit employing the generator of this invention. A
      square-wave input signal, furnished by appropriate transistorized
      switching means, is applied at the input terminals (S), to the
      primary (a) of a step-down transformer 11. The secondary winding
      (b) of the input transformer may be a single turn, in series with
      a capacitor 12 and the generator 13 input coil (c), forming a
      series resonant circuit. The frequency of the applied square wave
      (S) must either match, or be an integral sub-harmonic of the
      resonant frequency of this 3-element
      transformer-capacitor-inductor input circuit.<br>
      <br>
      Generator 13 output winding (d) is connected to resistive load L
      through switch 14. When switch 14 is closed, generated power is
      dissipated at L, which is any resistive load, for example, an
      incandescent lamp or resistive heater.<br>
      <br>
      Once input resonance is achieved, and the square wave input
      frequency applied at S is such that the combined reactive
      impedance of total inductance (b+c) is equal in magnitude to the
      opposing reactive impedance of capacitance 12, the electrical
      phases of current through, and voltage across, generator 13 input
      coil (c) will flow 90 degrees apart in resonant quadrature. Power
      drawn from the square wave input-energy source applying power to S
      will now be at a minimum.<br>
      <br>
      In this condition, the resonant energy present at the generator
      input may be measured by connecting a voltage probe across the
      test points (v), situated across the generator input coil,
      together with a current probe around point (i), situated in series
      with the generator input coil (c). The instantaneous vector
      product of these two measurements indicates the energy circulating
      at the generator's input, ultimately shifting the permanent
      magnets' fields.<br>
      <br>
      It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a square (or
      other) wave may be applied directly to the generator input
      terminals (c) without use of other components. Use of a resonant
      circuit, particularly with inclusion of a capacitor 12 as
      suggested, facilitates recirculation of energy within the input
      circuit, generally producing efficient excitation as loads are
      applied.<br>

      <br>
      A ferromagnetic material having non-zero magnetoelasticity, and/or
      nonzero magnetostriction is driven with vibratory mechanical
      energy at a frequency producing at least one resonant vibratory
      mode, by coupling a source of vibratory energy to the
      ferromagnetic structure. The ferromagnetic material threads at
      least one conductive wire or wire coil, and couples to at least
      one source of magnetic induction, and provides an electrical power
      output driven by the magnetic induction. The origin of vibratory
      energy and the site or sites of magnetic induction are situated at
      distinct locations, separated by a specific distance not less than
      [1/8] the fundamental acoustic wavelength. Various combinations of
      acoustic wavelength, ferromagnetic material type, and source of
      vibration produce independent transfer coefficients between
      acoustic and electromagnetic energy which are either positive,
      zero, or negative.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Magnetoelasticity is defined as the sensitivity of a ferromagnetic
      material's magnetic characteristics to mechanical stress. Stress
      exerted on the ferromagnetic material produces a corresponding
      mechanical strain within the material. A ferromagnetic material
      having nonzero magnetoelastic coefficient is herein referred to as
      a magnetoelastic material. When a magnetoelastic material is
      subjected to alternating mechanical pressures, an alternation of
      its magnetic properties is correspondingly produced. When a
      magnetoelastic material subject to mechanical stress carries
      nonzero magnetic flux, the magnetic flux correspondingly changes
      with pressure applied to the ferromagnetic material. A changing
      magnetic flux is able to induce electrical signals and power by
      the mechanism of electromagnetic induction.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetostriction is defined as a ferromagnetic material's ability
      to produce mechanical stress and strain causing changes in shape
      or volume, in a manner that corresponds to the magnetic
      polarization of the ferromagnetic material. A ferromagnetic
      material having non-zero magnetostriction is herein referred to as
      a magnetostrictive material. When a magnetostrictive material
      carries alternating magnetic flux, its internal stresses and
      physical dimensions vary corresponding to the magnetic field. All
      ferromagnetic materials have some degree of magnetostriction, and
      some degree of magnetoelasticity.<br>
      <br>
      Vibration or alternating pressure within a medium is acoustic
      energy. Magnetoelastic materials are able to convert acoustic
      energy into magnetic energy. Conversely, magnetostrictive
      materials are able to convert magnetic energy into acoustic
      energy. Electromagnetic induction is able to exchange electrical
      energy with magnetic energy. The combination of electromagnetic
      induction, and magnetostriction and/or magnetoelasticity, provides
      a bridge between electrical and acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Ferromagnetic materials are often both magnetoelastic and
      magnetostrictive. However, some magnetic materials exhibit
      magnetostriction and magnetoelasticity which are not equal in
      magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      Ferro-magnetic materials consist of magnetic dipoles which can be
      polarized magnetically. A complimentary class of ferro-electric
      materials consists of electric dipoles which can be polarized
      electrically. Piezoelectric materials contain ferroelectric
      dipoles capable of permanent polarization. Piezoelectric materials
      are generally well known as materials able to convert electrical
      energy to acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b><br>
      <br>
      A small body of prior art exists exploiting the above
      relationships between material types. Due to the complimentary
      properties of electric charge and magnetic flux, physical
      vibratory interaction between magnetostrictive materials and
      electrostrictive or piezoelectric materials produces likewise
      complimentary energy relationships which presently are regarded as
      novel. Among the well-known family of reactive electrical
      components such as inductors, capacitors and transformers, a
      lesser-known component called the gyrator is produced by
      mechanically interfacing magnetostrictive and piezoelectric
      materials within the same component. Energy exchange between the
      magnetostrictive and piezoelectric materials produces a circuit
      component with unique properties among the more familiar reactive
      components, as detailed in the teachings of Viehland et al, US
      2006/0279171, as a representative example of the art. Hybrid
      energy converters bearing similarity to magnetic or piezoelectric
      transformers are constructed by similar means, as illustrated
      again by Viehland et al, US 2005/0194863.<br>
      <br>
      Several prior art devices exist which incorporate magnetostrictive
      and piezoelectric materials in intimate, physically coupled
      contact such that vibration of one material translates to
      vibration of the other; thus of their assembly as a whole.
      However, the immediate, co-located physical contact between
      different materials in these devices demands both vibrate and
      respond as a single entity, where the timing of the vibrations in
      each material are generally simultaneous. The present invention
      represents a novel departure from this approach.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method and
      device for generating and transferring electrical power using a
      acoustic or vibratory means, in combination with an
      electromagnetic coupling means, capable of providing highly
      efficient energy transfer, thereby substantially obviating one or
      more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of
      the related art.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a energy generating apparatus essentially
      comprising an energy transfer and multiplier element being
      constructed of a ferromagnetic substance possessing
      magnetostrictive characteristics, magnetoelastic characteristics,
      or both; and having a natural resonance, due to a physical
      structure whose dimensions are directly proportional to the
      wavelength of the resonance frequency, an electromagnetic coupling
      element comprising a winding of at least one turn of conductive
      wire encircling the energy transfer and multiplier element, a
      magnetic field induced along the linear dimension of the energy
      transfer and multiplier element, and a exciter means capable of
      inducing an acoustic wave within the energy transfer and
      multiplier element, such as a piezoelectric device or linear
      motor. When energized by the exciter element, a current is
      generated in the coupling element.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Description of the Physics of the Invention:</b><br>
      <br>
      Vibratory energy, as acoustic energy within a solid material,
      propagates at a speed that is generally unique to that material.
      Ferromagnetic solids have an acoustic velocity, or speed of sound,
      in the range of 5000 meters/second. Acoustic energy applied at a
      given point propagates outward very slowly, relative to
      electromagnetic energy such as light, whose speed in vacuum is
      standardized at 299,792,458 meters/second. Acoustic energy in
      ferromagnetic solids propagates at about 0.0016% the speed at
      which electromagnetic energy propagates in free space.<br>
      <br>
      Owing to this relatively slow propagation velocity, acoustic waves
      traveling through solids experience substantial phase shifts over
      relatively small distances, relative to frequency. A 125 kHz
      acoustic wave propagating through a ferromagnetic solid having
      5000 m/s acoustic velocity experiences a 90 degree phase shift
      over a distance of 1 cm. An electromagnetic wave of 125 kHz
      propagating through free space only achieves a 90 degree phase
      shift at a distance of 600 meters. Due to the substantial delays
      incurred by slow acoustic propagation velocity in ferromagnetic
      solids, a source of coherent acoustic wave energy in the
      sub-megahertz band may be exerting a compressive stress at a
      specific instant, while the acoustic pressure a few centimeters
      away is tensile, nil, or of intermediate value. Because acoustic
      waves can translate to electrical energy by the means disclosed
      herein, thereby determining the phase of the electrical waves, and
      because the phase of electrical waves determines the type and
      content of the electrical energy, acoustical phase-shifting
      produces electro-acoustic power transformations novel among prior
      art.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic materials including iron, nickel, silicon iron and other
      iron alloys, amorphous metal (such as Metglas, Metglas Inc.,
      Conway, S.C.), nanocrystalline alloys (such as Finemet, Hitachi
      Metals Inc., Tokyo, Japan); magnetic ferrites (such as Re—Fe2O4
      where Re=Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, Li; and Re—Fe12O19 where Re=La, Ba, Sr,
      Pb) and the mineral hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) exhibit
      magnetoelasticity. The magnetic properties of each material are,
      to various extents, dependent on stress applied to the material.
      Generally, compressive stress will decrease the magnetic
      susceptibility to polarization, and decrease the saturation
      magnetization, while increasing the coercive force of the material
      along the stress axis; while tensile stress produces the opposite
      changes, increasing the magnetic susceptibility and saturation
      magnetization, and decreasing the coercive force along the stress
      axis.<br>
      <br>
      A cylindrical rod of solid material with an axial length greater
      than its diameter will support longitudinal acoustic resonance
      along its cylindrical axis. When an acoustic or vibratory impulse
      is applied at the proximate rod end, acoustic energy propagates
      down the rod axis at the acoustic velocity of the rod material.
      Upon reaching the distal end of the rod, the acoustic energy is
      reflected, retracing its course toward the proximate rod end. The
      round-trip duration of acoustic wave travel down the rod axis and
      back is the acoustic reflection period. The reciprocal of the
      acoustic reflection period is the rod's fundamental longitudinal
      acoustic resonant frequency. This frequency is defined
      mathematically as<br>
      V/(2*L)=F<br>
      <br>
      Where<br>
      <br>
      V is the acoustic velocity of a material in meters/second,<br>
      <br>
      L is the acoustic length of the material in meters; and,<br>
      <br>
      F is the fundamental resonant frequency in Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      The factor of 2 in the above formula accounts for the reflection
      of the acoustic wave, which travels distance L, reflects off the
      boundary at the end of length L, then retraces its path, traveling
      distance L a second time before returning to its point of origin,
      thus completing one resonant wave cycle.<br>
      <br>
      In this resonant condition, the rod material functions as a tuned
      waveguide, or longitudinal resonator, for acoustic energy. When
      axial vibratory energy is applied to the rod at the rod's
      fundamental axial resonant frequency, or integer multiples of this
      resonant frequency, standing acoustic waves are produced along the
      rod axis. A standing longitudinal acoustic wave in a rod consists
      of neighboring regions of a) maximum axially reciprocating
      displacement of the rod material at the vibratory frequency,
      termed antinodes, and b) regions of axially-directed alternating
      stress within the rod material, also at the vibratory frequency,
      termed nodal points. At the rod's fundamental half-wave
      longitudinal resonant frequency, wave antinodes appear at the ends
      of the rod, while a nodal point is at the center of the rod.<br>
      <br>
      When the rod is mechanically driven at frequencies which are
      integer multiples of this fundamental axial resonant frequency,
      the number of nodal points and antinodes increases, as illustrated
      in FIG. 2. Where more than one anti-node exists, each anti-node
      will exhibit axial displacement of direction opposite to the
      closest adjacent antinodes. Where more than one nodal point
      exists, each nodal point will contain axial stress that is
      opposite the sign of axial stress in the closest adjacent nodal
      points.<br>
      <br>
      When a rod such as illustrated is formed of a solid,
      magnetoelastically active ferromagnetic material, the oscillating
      stress at the nodal point or points produces an oscillating change
      in the magnetic properties of the rod in the nodal regions, via
      the magnetoelastic activity of the rod material.<br>
      <br>
      At least one permanent magnet, electromagnet, or other source of
      magnetic flux, termed “bias magnet”, may be provided which
      magnetically biases the rod along its length, or portions of its
      length. The ferromagnetic rod becomes magnetically polarized along
      its axis, in response to the magnetic field applied to it by the
      bias magnet. Resonant longitudinal vibration along the rod axis
      produces at least one nodal point along this axis. The alternating
      stress at a nodal point produces a corresponding cyclic variation
      of the magnetic coercive force and magnetic susceptibility via the
      magnetoelastic effect. The periodically changing magnetic
      properties vary the degree of effective magnetic polarization
      within the rod, thereby producing a time-varying magnetic field.
      This time-varying magnetic field will induce electrical current by
      means well known in the art, most simply by winding a coil of
      conductive wire encircling the rod at its nodal point or points.<br>
      <br>
      The time varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force, or
      EMF, in the electrical conductor, such as wire or wire coil, wound
      around the rod at or near the nodal point or points. When an
      electrical circuit including this wire coil is closed, electrical
      current will flow. This circuit may include an electrical load of
      any type, such that the device disclosed herein functions as an
      electrical generator, powering that load. At least three novel
      situations appear in this utilization, departing significantly
      from prior generator art, and which also depart significantly from
      the prior teachings in works utilizing energy exchange between
      magnetostrictive and piezoelectric materials, as typified in the
      related art listed above. These novel interactions further
      exemplify the novelty of the disclosed invention.<br>
      <br>
      [A]: Lenz Field Addition. A changing magnetic field induces
      electrical current. Any current thus induced produces a secondary,
      induced magnetic field. This secondary magnetic field acts to
      oppose the first, causative magnetic field, such that the primary
      and secondary magnetic fields are of opposite sign, and exhibit
      opposing changes with respect to time. The secondary magnetic
      field will tend to cancel the primary magnetic field. This
      tendency is known as Lenz's Law, an electromagnetic rule governing
      induction of electrical currents by a changing magnetic field. In
      the disclosed invention, the changing magnetic field produced at a
      nodal point within a magnetoelastically active material induces
      electrical current in a coil of conductive wire wound around it;
      this coil of conductive wire then produces a secondary magnetic
      field due to passage of induced current within it, which tends to
      oppose the primary changing magnetic field produced
      magnetoelastically. This mutually opposing interaction limits the
      electrical power generated by a single nodal point.<br>
      <br>
      Harmonic resonance causes multiple nodal points to exist, as
      illustrated in FIG. 2. When more than one nodal point exists, each
      nodal point will contain mechanical stress of a sign opposite to
      stresses within the nearest adjacent nodal point or nodes. Since
      the mechanical stress in neighboring nodes is opposite, the
      magnetoelastic changes produced by the stresses are also opposite.
      Therefore the changing magnetic fields produced at the nodal
      points change oppositely to one another, and the current induced
      within individual wire coils wound around respectively individual
      nodal points is of mutually opposite sign. For example, a rod of
      magnetoelastic material acoustically excited at a frequency
      creating two nodal points will induce oppositely-directed currents
      in the two wire coils, one wound around each nodal point, as
      schematically depicted in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      Harmonic resonance produces a structural mechanism enforcing
      additional magnetic opposition among the oppositely directed
      currents flowing in neighboring co-located wire coils, apparent as
      additional magnetic opposition between the two or more wire coils
      neighboring each other along the same magnetic path. The further
      magnetic opposition between neighboring coils having opposing
      induced currents thereby adds to the total amount of magnetic
      opposition present at each nodal point and wire coil, and in the
      apparatus as a whole. Because electric power is generated via
      magnetic opposition, this additional magnetic opposition increases
      the total electrical energy delivered by each coil, hence the
      total electrical energy delivered by the device as a whole. In
      addition, the proximity of counter-flowing currents in neighboring
      coils tends to decrease the self-inductance of each wire coil,
      allowing greater amounts of electrical current to flow from the
      device and power an electrical load.<br>
      <br>
      Since operation at different acoustic frequencies results in a
      different number of nodal points, the above situation may include,
      and benefit from practically any number of nodal points and
      related wire coils. The scope of this invention includes at least
      one “bias magnet” producing magnetic polarization of the
      magnetoelastically active ferromagnetic material undergoing
      acoustic vibration, but is not limited to a single bias magnet;
      numerous combinations of nodal structure, bias magnet structure,
      and magnetoelastic material structure exist, which will be
      exemplified by illustration below, but whose description is not
      intended to limit the number of combinations achievable within the
      scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [B]. Magnetostrictive Positive Feedback. In the present invention,
      acoustic waves produce time-varying mechanical stress in a
      magnetoelastic material which is magnetically polarized. A
      time-varying magnetic field is thus produced, which induces
      electric current in wire coils or other means of receiving an
      electromotive force, located near the nodal wave points within the
      ferromagnetic material. These induced currents produce opposing
      magnetic reaction, to which the ferromagnetic material is also
      exposed. Many magnetoelastic materials also exhibit
      magnetostrictive action, whereby a changing magnetic field is able
      to produce further stress, sourcing additional acoustic energy, in
      the ferromagnetic material in addition to the acoustic energy
      already present. In a ferromagnetic material having nonzero
      magnetostriction, the time-varying reaction magnetic field
      produced by induced current produces its own time-varying stress
      wave in the material, creating a second acoustic wave component
      proportional to the load current, and whose origin is nearest the
      wire coil carrying this current.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the ferromagnetic material itself may be acoustically
      actuated by piezoelectric, electromagnet, or other means of
      vibratory activity, producing acoustic resonance in the
      ferromagnetic material; while the magnetic material itself may
      itself produce a second set of acoustic waves owing to its
      magnetostrictive action under the influence of induced current.
      The source of originating vibratory activity, such as a
      piezoelectric material, and the additional source of vibratory
      stress energy due to magnetostriction and induced current do not
      share an identical location. Typically, within the scope of this
      invention, these two sites will be separated by at least 1⁄8 of an
      acoustic wavelength, and more preferably 1⁄4 of an acoustic
      wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      Due to this physical separation, propagation of acoustic waves
      from both sources includes time delays which shift the phase of
      the acoustic energy. The extent of this propagation delay
      determines the relative phase angle of the acoustic energy at
      different points along the resonator structure considered as an
      acoustic transmission line. At some points, due to the wave delay
      and phase shift, the acoustic energy from all sources adds
      constructively, producing a net acoustic wave of greater intensity
      than any source considered alone. At other points the sum acoustic
      energy may be small and tend toward zero, where acoustic waves
      produce destructive interference. The locations where acoustic
      energy adds or annihilates depend on the resonator geometry,
      relative spacing between the sources of acoustic wave energy, the
      phase of magnetically induced current relative to the phase of
      incident acoustic waves, and fine frequency tuning of the applied
      vibratory or acoustic energy. Judicious adjustment of these
      factors causes acoustic energy to accumulate where it is most
      desired, for the purpose of generating electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      Constructive wave interference exemplary of this definition is
      illustrated in FIG. 5. A bar of ferromagnetic material is
      provided, having nonzero magnetoelastic and magnetostrictive
      activity. One end of this bar is provided with a source of
      vibratory energy, which in FIG. 5 is a wafer of piezoelectric
      ceramic. An alternating-current voltage signal is applied between
      the pole electrodes of the piezoelectric ceramic, at a frequency
      producing a fundamental standing wave within the ferromagnetic
      bar. Acoustic energy originates at the end of the bar to which the
      piezoelectric ceramic is attached, and which propagates outward
      along the bar axis away from the piezoelectric ceramic.<br>
      <br>
      At resonance, a nodal point appears in the center of the
      ferromagnetic bar. A bias magnet structure is provided for
      magnetically polarizing the ferromagnetic bar, as well as a wire
      coil shown for purposes of inducing electrical power from the
      changing magnetic flux which results. When an electrical circuit
      containing this wire coil is closed, allowing electrical current
      to flow, the resulting reaction magnetic field acts
      magnetostrictively within the ferromagnetic bar, producing a
      secondary acoustic wave originating from the nodal point in the
      center of the bar. This secondary acoustic wave originating from
      magnetostrictive action propagates to both ends of the bar
      including the end with the piezoelectric ceramic attached.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic distance between the piezoelectric vibration source
      and the nodal point in the center of the ferromagnetic bar is
      approximately 1⁄4 of an acoustic wavelength, at the fundamental
      resonance frequency of the bar. Therefore the phase of an acoustic
      wave traveling this distance is delayed by 90 degrees. The
      vibration source exerts a forward-thrusting acoustic wavefront
      which propagates along the axis of the bar. Upon reaching the
      nodal point the wave has been phase shifted 90 degrees with
      respect to the source due to propagation delay. The nodal point
      produces a time varying magnetic field by the means described
      above. This time varying magnetic field is opposed by the reaction
      magnetic field arising from induced current flowing in the wire
      coil; this magnetic opposition creates an additional 180 degree
      phase shift between action and reaction. The reaction magnetic
      field acts on the ferromagnetic bar's magnetostriction, producing
      a secondary source of acoustic energy originating from the coil's
      location at the nodal point, and propagating axially outward. The
      reaction wave which propagates back toward the vibration source
      must travel another 1⁄4 acoustic wavelength, incurring an
      additional 90 degree phase delay, before returning to the site of
      the original vibration source and exerting its force.<br>
      <br>
      When the sum of the above phase delays is taken, the total delay
      is 360 degrees, and is mathematically equivalent to zero degrees
      of total phase delay. Damping or opposition to the mechanical
      vibration would be approximated as a reaction wave shifted 180
      degrees with respect to the source wave, or inverted with respect
      to the source wave, thus opposing the source and destructively
      interfering with the source. Since the total phase delay of the
      reaction wave in this example is 360 or 0 degrees of phase,
      destructive interference is replaced by constructive interference.
      Thus the piezoelectric ceramic, illustrated here as the
      originating source for mechanical vibration, experiences secondary
      mechanical reaction forces augmenting its own forces, rather than
      opposing these forces, when induced current is allowed to flow
      through the nodal-point wire coil of FIG. 5 in a closed circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [C]: Harmonic Addition: The representative piezoelectric ceramic
      wafer of FIG. 5 may be provided with harmonic energy, or connected
      to a source of time-varying voltage which includes a harmonic
      series. An electrical “square wave”, commonly known in the art,
      may be applied to the piezoelectric ceramic, thereby applying
      harmonic energy to the piezoelectric ceramic with a Fourier
      frequency spectrum including a fundamental frequency, plus
      odd-order higher harmonics of decreasing amplitude that are
      phase-locked to its fundamental frequency. The mechanical
      oscillation of the ferromagnetic bar will thus be a superposition
      of the odd-numbered states illustrated in FIG. 2, present
      simultaneously, and by various degrees, as determined by the
      relative intensity of the odd-order harmonic series present in the
      square wave signal electrically applied.<br>
      <br>
      In this condition, the ferromagnetic bar will exhibit a
      multiplicity of nodal points, each with a specific amplitude and
      harmonic content. Major nodal points also exist, which include
      energy at all harmonics including the fundamental. FIG. 2
      illustrates how, in this condition, the nodal point in the center
      of the ferromagnetic bar will become a major nodal point, since
      this central node is common to all odd-numbered harmonic vibratory
      modes.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, current induced in a wire coil placed around this
      central major node will include energy at several frequencies,
      which are summed into a single current wave rich in harmonic
      energy. At a particular frequency of the applied wave, the nodal
      point for each harmonic mode physically overlaps the others
      exactly, and their instantaneous amplitudes add together,
      producing a peak current in the wire coil in significant excess of
      the average current. Electrical power may be given as<br>
      P=I^2*R<br>
      <br>
      Where<br>
      <br>
      P is power, in Watts,<br>
      <br>
      I is current, in Amperes; and,<br>
      <br>
      R is resistance, in Ohms.<br>
      <br>
      The high-amplitude peaks in the current developed under harmonic
      excitation produce electrical power as the square of their
      instantaneous value. The instantaneous electrical power developed
      in this manner is the square of the sum of the energy induced by
      each acoustic frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The above three functions are exemplary as novelties of the
      invention disclosed herein. It will be understood these conditions
      arise due to magnetoelastic induction in a ferromagnetic material
      whose physical shape, including rods, is generally amenable to
      mechanical resonance; wherein the location of the source of
      vibratory energy initiating that resonance, and the locations
      where reduction of that resonance to electrical energy occur, are
      physically separated by a specific and non-zero fraction of the
      fundamental acoustic wavelength not less than 1⁄8 of the acoustic
      wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      Such novel conditions tend to arise regardless of the
      ferromagnetic resonator's physical configuration, the exact
      material type of the resonator, or the particular technology
      utilized in generation of the originating vibratory energy.
      Examples of sources of originating vibratory energy include, but
      are not limited to, piezoelectric materials or electrostrictive
      materials, including their utilization within Langevin-style
      bolted transducers; electrostatic actuators, magnetostrictive
      materials, percussive combustion, rotary vibration induced by
      cams, pendulums, rotary hammers, or eccentric weights; vibrating
      strings or membranes, or electromagnetic actuators including
      linear motors, buzzers, or vibrators incorporating any of the
      following: inductive wire coils, permanent magnets, and
      ferromagnetic materials including magnetostrictive materials.<br>
      <br>
      A related field known as power harvesting incorporates
      magnetostrictive and/or magnetoelastic materials and physical
      vibrations with the object of reducing ambient, often byproduct,
      vibrations to electrical energy. Power harvesting techniques are
      typically utilized aboard moving vehicles or engines, or in
      micro-power applications within personal or structural devices.
      The present invention differs significantly from the class of
      power harvesting devices, recognizing the following distinctions.<br>
      <br>
      1) Power harvesting generators utilize ambient mechanical
      vibrations of arbitrary frequency; either utilizing such
      variegated, ambient or random vibratory energy in bulk, or by
      using it to drive an internal resonance at a particular frequency;
      the source of vibratory energy is often of unknown or non-specific
      frequency or amplitude, and is located external to the device. The
      present invention locates the source of vibratory energy within
      the device as an integral facet of its structure, with the aim of
      securing coherent mechanical resonance within the source of
      acoustic vibration and within the ferromagnetic material to be
      vibrated. In the present invention, ambient vibrations of external
      origin are not utilized, and the device has no connection to its
      external environment for physically conveying such vibration.<br>
      <br>
      2) Power harvesting techniques incorporate a free weight,
      back-weight, or other moving mass in conjunction with the active
      ferromagnetic material such that vibratory energy is passed from
      an external source and through the active material, en route to
      disturb the inertia of the moving mass and thereby induce
      mechanical stress within the intervening ferromagnetic material
      utilized as a generator. In the present invention, vibratory
      mechanical energy resonates within the elasticity and the inertia
      of the active ferromagnetic material itself; no free weights are
      present.<br>
      <br>
      3) Power harvesting devices typically utilize mechanical
      vibrations in the low-audible, or sub-audible, frequency range
      between about 10 Hz and 1,000 Hz; the typical target frequencies
      of interest fall within 20 Hz-200 Hz. Typical sources of vibration
      include engine noise, or the periodic motion of shoes,
      wristwatches or pocket devices. The present invention utilizes a
      frequency range that is generally above 1,000 Hz, with most
      preferred embodiments establishing mechanical resonance at
      frequencies of 5,000 Hz and above, up to acoustic frequencies of 5
      MHz and beyond. An exception may be made for very large devices,
      of acoustic length sufficient to establish fundamental resonance
      at international power frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz. Regardless of
      preferred operating frequency, the aforementioned distinctions
      establish a clear boundary between the novel aspects of this
      invention including its own vibratory source, and the prior art
      harvesting mechanical power from external, ambient vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      4) Power harvesting depends on ambient vibrations over which the
      power harvesting generator has no control. A power harvesting
      generator does not actively control the frequency, the amplitude,
      or the presence or absence of incoming vibrations, and is subject
      to them as a passive entity. The present invention typically
      includes self-contained means of controlling the amplitude,
      wave-shape, phase and frequency of its vibratory source, via a
      feedback circuit, microprocessor control, or via self-resonance
      between the magnetoelastic induction and the originating vibratory
      energy source connected by a mutual circuit. The present invention
      does not present a passive load to externally occurring
      vibrations, but generates acoustic energy internally, intended for
      internal use, by preferably incorporating a self-contained
      mechanism of controlling and/or modulating its internal vibratory
      source.<br>
      <br>
      Because the present invention utilizes a definite and specific
      frequency, or harmonically related set of frequencies, its
      physical structure may necessitate acoustic waveguide sections,
      acoustic horns or focusing devices, acoustic tuning stubs, or
      acoustic-impedance matching networks required to efficiently
      sustain acoustic resonance. These elements of design are acoustic
      sections dimensioned to specific acoustic lengths, generally as
      integer multiples of 1⁄4 the acoustic wavelength of the
      fundamental acoustic wave or its higher harmonics. Such acoustic
      sections produce acoustical impedance matching between the
      vibratory source and ferromagnetic material within the device.
      These impedance matching sections are the acoustic equivalents of
      electromagnetic impedance matching networks common to the arts of
      electrical power transmission, radio wave antennas, and radio
      transmitters and receivers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of the process of wave
      propagation in elastic media. Since no physical material is
      infinitely rigid, all physical materials are to some degree
      elastic, or deformable under stress. The relationship between
      applied stress and resulting deformation or strain may be modeled
      by a lattice of masses connected by elastic springs. Both inertial
      and elastic restoring forces act upon each mass and connecting
      elastic spring. When stress and strain vary with time, acoustic
      wavefronts propagate through the elastic mass as illustrated by
      this model, wherein the vibration or oscillatory motion of the
      masses represents the acoustic wave.<br>
      <br>
      A mass on a spring has a single resonant frequency determined by
      its spring constant K and its mass M. The spring constant is the
      restoring force of a spring per unit of length. Within the elastic
      limit of any material, there is a linear relationship between the
      displacement of a mass and the force attempting to restore the
      mass to its equilibrium position. This linear dependency is
      described by Hooke's Law:<br>
      F=(−K)*X<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      F is the force,<br>
      <br>
      K is the spring constant; and,<br>
      <br>
      X is the amount of particle displacement.<br>
      <br>
      Forces applied to a mass are equal to the magnitude of the mass,
      times the acceleration applied. From Newton's Second Law,<br>
      F=M*A<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      F is the force,<br>
      <br>
      M is the mass; and,<br>
      <br>
      A is the acceleration.<br>
      <br>
      The force F, as common to both equations above, represents the
      nature of the equilibrium between acceleration A and displacement
      X in an elastic material. With the applied and restoring forces F
      in the above formulae, taken as equal,<br>
      M*A=(−K)*X<br>
      <br>
      Where the displacement of the mass, on the left hand side of the
      equality, and the restoring force of the spring on the right hand
      side of the equality, are in opposition.<br>
      <br>
      The mass M, and spring constant K, are constants for physical
      materials at a constant temperature. The acceleration A and
      resulting displacement X are the variable quantities describing
      the mechanical energy. From the above equation, these two
      variables A and X are directly proportional. The time for
      displacement of a mass and its return to a position of mechanical
      equilibrium are independent of applied force.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical energy in the form of acoustic waves propagates at
      different speeds in different materials. The mass of the atomic
      particles and the spring constants are specific to material
      composition and, to a lesser extent, by factors such as
      temperature. The mass of the particles is related to the density
      of the material, and the spring constant is related to the elastic
      constants of a material. The general relationship between the
      velocity of mechanical waves in a solid and its density and
      elastic constants is given by the following equation:<br>
      V=sqrt(C/P)<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      V is the velocity of longitudinal mechanical waves in the
      material,<br>
      <br>
      C is the elastic constant for longitudinal stress,<br>
      <br>
      P is the material density, and<br>
      <br>
      sqrt denotes a square root function.<br>
      <br>
      In the representative physical model of FIG. 1, circular objects
      100, 101, 102, 103, represent solid masses having negligible
      elasticity and significant inertia. Elastic springs 110, 111, 112
      signify the coupling between masses, having the complimentary
      properties of negligible inertia, and significant elasticity. The
      masses are taken to represent atomic nucleus masses or other
      inertially significant units, such as molecules, in a physical
      substance. The elastic springs are taken as the electronic or
      atomic-level bonds between these inertial masses. For solids,
      these elastic bonds are atomic electron shell bonds such as
      covalent bonds.<br>
      <br>
      Labels T1-1, at top, through T2-3, at bottom represent progressive
      instants of time during which the ongoing state of longitudinal
      wave propagation is analyzed. At time T1-1, the system of masses
      and their elastic connections is at rest, where non-equilibrium
      mechanical energy is not present in kinetic, or potential, form.<br>
      <br>
      At instant T1-2, an accelerating force 120 is applied to mass 100
      causing longitudinal displacement and acceleration of the mass
      100, as indicated by the rightward diagram arrow within mass 100.
      Accelerating force 120 thereby places the system of FIG. 1 in a
      non-equilibrium state. The resulting displacement of mass 100
      elastically compresses spring 110, causing it to contract as
      illustrated. At this instant T1-2, laterally adjacent mass 101 has
      not moved, owing to its inertia. The kinetic energy of
      acceleration 120 is converted first to kinetic energy of mass 100,
      and subsequently into potential energy as elastic compression in
      spring 110. The complete transfer of kinetic energy of mass 100 to
      potential energy in elastic spring 110 causes mass 100 to come to
      rest, after accelerating force 120 is withdrawn. At this time, the
      kinetic energy of acceleration 120 has been stored as potential
      energy, or tension, in elastic spring 110.<br>
      <br>
      At the time where the potential energy of tension in spring 110
      reaches a maximum, the kinetic energy of mass 100 approaches zero,
      or rest, while the kinetic energy of rightward adjacent mass 101
      begins its rise from zero, into motion.<br>
      <br>
      At subsequent instant T1-3, the potential energy of compression in
      spring 110 is converted back to kinetic energy of acceleration of
      the next mass 101, causing rising acceleration of mass 101 as
      previous mass 100 approaches a state of rest. The kinetic energy
      of mass 100 has been transferred to the kinetic energy of next
      mass 101, through connecting elastic spring 110. The transfer of
      kinetic energy between adjacent masses has required conversion of
      this kinetic energy into potential energy and back again, a
      process which occurs over a finite period of time, or a delay
      between the displacements of mass 100 and 101. This delay in the
      transfer of kinetic energy between adjacent masses is commonly
      known as the acoustic velocity, or speed of sound, in the
      material, as illustrated by the equations above.<br>
      <br>
      At subsequent instant T1-3, the above process repeats at a new
      location, between mass 101 (containing rightward diagram arrow
      indicating its state of motion) coming to rest by progressively
      compressing elastic spring 111, whose ensuing relaxation initiates
      acceleration of mass 102.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent instant T1-4 repeats this process further, now between
      mass 102, elastic spring 112, and into final mass 103.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent instant T1-5 illustrates the limit of longitudinal
      acoustic wave propagation in the right-hand direction of FIG. 1.
      At this time, the kinetic accelerating force originally applied to
      first mass 100 at time T1-2 has propagated to final mass 103,
      indicated by the rightward diagram arrow within mass 103. At this
      instant, the state of the model is similar to the initial state
      T1-1, with the exceptions of mass 103 retaining kinetic energy,
      and transposition of the model, assumed to be free in space, to
      the right due to the initial rightward acceleration 120 having
      propagated through the model. Without any further elastic spring
      to the right, mass 103 continues in rightward motion.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T1-6 illustrates the continuation of rightward
      longitudinal displacement of final rightward mass 103. This
      continued motion ultimately expands elastic spring 112, causing a
      conversion of kinetic energy from mass 103 into potential energy
      in the form of tension within elastic spring 112.<br>
      <br>
      In the preceding instants T1-2 through T1-4 the potential energy
      within elastic springs in the propagation model was compressive,
      while the direction of wave propagation was to the right hand
      side. In subsequent instants T1-6 through T1-8, the potential
      energy within successive elastic springs in the propagation model
      is tensile, while the direction of wave return, or reflection, is
      toward the left hand side of FIG. 1. The sign of the potential
      energy sequentially stored in elastic springs 112, 111, 110, and
      the direction of mechanical wave propagation resulting from
      sequential restoration of kinetic energy of masses 103, 102, 101,
      100, have each reversed. The transfer between kinetic energy of
      the masses and potential energy in the elastic springs is
      identical to the process described above, with the vector of wave
      propagation and the sign of elastic potential energy now being
      opposite.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T1-7 illustrates the reflective propagation due to the
      restoration of tensile potential energy stored in elastic spring
      112, into acceleration of mass 102. The kinetic energy of
      rightmost mass 103 has been absorbed by elastic spring 112 and
      transferred to kinetic energy on mass 102 via elastic spring 112.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T1-8 illustrates propagation of the above sequence to
      interaction between mass 101, converting its kinetic energy to
      potential energy of tension in spring 110, whose relaxation will
      initiate acceleration of leftward mass 100.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T2-1 depicts the acceleration of mass 100 due to
      relaxation of tensile force in spring 110. At this instant, the
      state of the model is once again similar to the initial state
      T1-1, this time with the exceptions of mass 100 retaining kinetic
      energy, and further transposition of the model, assumed to be free
      in space, to the right due to the initially applied rightward
      acceleration 120 having continued to propagate throughout the
      model. Without any further elastic spring to the left, mass 100
      continues in rightward motion.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T2-2 illustrates the continuation of rightward
      longitudinal displacement of the leftmost mass 100, ultimately
      compressing elastic spring 110. At this instant T2-2, the action
      in the model is completely identical to the originating instant
      T1-2, with the single exception that the initial kinetic
      acceleration 120 has never been dissipated or relieved, and
      reappears in the model as if applied for a second time. The
      initial energy of acceleration 102 has been propagated by the
      model, and continues to propagate as the above processes
      indefinitely repeat. Since this model is assumed to act in free
      space, the net action is an inchworm motion successively toward
      the right. Final absorption of the original kinetic energy 120
      requires intervention beyond the scope of this model.<br>
      <br>
      In actual mechanical resonators to be described below, the above
      action occurs between atoms constituting the resonator material
      and the elastic electron-shell bonds between these atoms. These
      physical resonators are assumed fixed in space, being supported by
      means attaching them to some fixed reference frame, such as an
      enclosure within an electronic device. The accelerating force 120
      is a periodocally alternating force, both rightward and leftward;
      thus net motion of the resonator in any direction is restrained
      and in balance. The above process of propagation and reflection,
      with the reversal in sign of the forces in springs between
      compressive and tensile, remain as illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the states T1-2 and T2-2 are effectively
      identical, but separated in time by a specific interval.
      Intermediary states (denoted by the number after the hyphen, such
      as -2, etc) cumulate as full propagation cycles as denoted by the
      transition of the major number, such as T1-T2. The cycle time
      between states T1-T2, which can likewise be stated as the cycle
      time between matching states T1-2 and T2-2, T1-3 and T2-3 etc., is
      the time per full cycle of the resonating structure. The
      reciprocal of this amount defines the resonant frequency at which
      this repetition occurs:<br>
      F=1/P<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      F is frequency, in Hertz or cycles-per-second, and<br>
      <br>
      P is the period, in seconds per cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The velocity of mechanical wave propagation in the figurative
      material may be defined equivalently to its first definition by
      dividing twice the mean length of the material, by the cycle
      repetition period. From FIG. 1, the mean length of the material is
      the length at rest illustrated by T1-1:<br>
      V=(2*L)/P<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      V is the velocity of longitudinal mechanical waves in the model or
      material, in meters per second;<br>
      <br>
      P is the cycle period, in seconds per full cycle,<br>
      <br>
      L is the mean length of the model or physical material in which
      the mechanical wave propagates, in meters; and,<br>
      <br>
      the factor of 2 represents the total propagation of the wave
      during a full cycle, along length L and returning back along same
      length L a second time to restore its initial state, thereby
      completing a full cycle.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 depicts the results of resonant mechanical wave
      interference in macroscopic samples of elastic material driven
      into longitudinal resonance at successive integer harmonic
      frequencies. It may be noted, from examining FIG. 1 that the
      length of the model as a whole elongates and contracts at rhythmic
      intervals related to the resonant frequency. FIG. 1 illustrates
      this behavior in response to a single acceleration event 120.
      Under repetitive acceleration, or application of force 120 in
      alternating longitudinal directions at an interval identical to
      the cycle time, driven resonance is established which rhythmically
      expands and contracts the model, or the elastic material. FIG. 4
      depicts the relevant wave mechanics in expanded detail, in
      preparation for description of a fundamental novelty of the
      disclosed invention.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2, a physical elastic material 200 undergoing resonant
      longitudinal expansion and contraction is driven into mechanical
      resonance by a repetitive alternating longitudinal force,
      illustrated as physical acceleration source 201. Acceleration
      source 201 may be any source of rhythmically alternating kinetic
      acceleration, including an electromagnetic motor, piezoelectric
      element, or incident pressure wave.<br>
      <br>
      The resonant frequency of elastic material 200 may be determined
      by its mechanical wave velocity (or acoustic velocity) divided by
      twice the physical length:<br>
      F=V/(2*L)<br>
      <br>
      Where:<br>
      <br>
      F is the fundamental resonant frequency in Hertz or
      cycles-per-second,<br>
      <br>
      V is the acoustic velocity of the resonator material, in meters
      per second,<br>
      <br>
      L is the physical length of the resonator material, in meters;
      and,<br>
      <br>
      the factor of 2 represents the completion of a full resonant cycle
      by wave propagation along length L, and subsequent reflection
      along length L retuning to the initial state.<br>
      <br>
      This defines the fundamental resonant frequency of the structure.
      Since the full acoustic wave must travel along length L twice in a
      full cycle, physical resonator length L may be taken as equal to
      half of the acoustic wavelength. Therefore, the structure of a
      standing acoustic wave in the resonating material at this
      fundamental frequency takes the form one half of an acoustic wave.<br>
      <br>
      A longitudinally propagating acoustic wave, as depicted in FIG. 1
      consists of two distinct components: firstly the longitudinal
      displacement of material and secondly the longitudinal elastic
      stress among the material's interatomic forces. The cyclic
      repetition of a resonant acoustic wave creates cyclical
      displacements and cyclical elastic stresses, both of which
      oscillate or vary at finite amplitude between positive and
      negative signs, at the frequency of oscillation. Since a single
      frequency without harmonic overtones is a sinusoidal wave, the
      above illustrated cyclical oscillations of longitudinal
      displacement and elastic stress are taken to alternate
      sinusoidally.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic wave in the resonator structure produces maxima of
      either quantity, located one quarter wavelength apart. An
      identical phenomenon is well known for electromagnetic waves
      within resonators and waveguides, wherein the maxima of electric
      and magnetic fields are located one quarter wavelength apart.
      Longitudinal acoustic waves in acoustic resonators obey the same
      generality, as a feature central to the disclosed invention.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2, condition 1F illustrates the structure of the standing
      wave at the fundamental resonant frequency, corresponding to
      one-half an acoustic wave distributed along the resonator length
      200. Acceleration source 201 is, in this case, producing
      sinusoidally alternating physical acceleration at the fundamental
      resonant frequency of the resonator 200, as defined by the above
      equation.<br>
      <br>
      In this condition, the acoustic wave structure along the
      resonator's length is one-half of a full wave, or two
      quarter-wavelengths. The maxima of longitudinal displacement and
      the maxima of longitudinal elastic stress are spaced one quarter
      wavelength apart. The maxima of longitudinal displacement, termed
      antinodes, are marked by diagram arrows at positions A. Maxima of
      longitudinal elastic stress, termed nodes or nodal points, are
      marked by diagram arrows at positions N. As illustrated in FIG. 1,
      the locations of peak displacement lay at the ends of the
      resonator model, placing the antinodes in FIG. 2: F1 at both ends
      of the resonator, and the nodal point of maximal elastic stress at
      the center of the resonator, one quarter wavelength from each end,
      at N.<br>
      <br>
      In diagram F1, the two antinodal points are marked A+ and A−,
      respectively. Nodal point A+ indicates the longitudinal
      displacement is in-phase, or acting with, the sinusoidal
      acceleration introduced to the resonator by acceleration source
      201. Nodal point A−, one half-wavelength distant, is 180 degrees
      out of phase, or opposite in sign with respect to the former.
      Being of oppositely signed longitudinal displacement, this more
      distant antinodal point is labeled A−. Since antinodal points A+
      and A− signify opposing longitudinal displacement, the total
      instantaneous length of resonator 200 is oscillating, the
      resonator 200 becoming physically longer and shorter at
      fundamental resonant frequency F. This alternation of length
      produces alternating compression and tension in the material of
      resonator 200, whose maxima of elastic stress is any nodal point
      N. The single nodal point in diagram F1 is given the sign N+,
      signifying the convention that compressive (positive) elastic
      stress is taken as being in-phase with the phase of acceleration
      source 201, while a negative, tensile elastic stress, or N−, is
      180 degrees out of phase with 201, having equal intensity while
      opposite in sign.<br>
      <br>
      Since elastic stress N is the direct product of displacement A;
      stress N and displacement A are in phase, each quantity reaching
      maximal or zero values simultaneously. A+ is taken as longitudinal
      displacement in phase with the displacement of longitudinal
      acceleration source 201 while displacement A− is out of phase, or
      opposite in direction; stress N+ is taken as compressive elastic
      stress in phase with acceleration source 201 while opposite stress
      N− is an opposing tensile elastic stress, in phase with
      acceleration source 201, this condition being identical to
      compressive elastic stress that is 180 degrees out of phase with
      acceleration source 201.<br>
      <br>
      As previously noted, the phenomenon of magnetoelasticity is the
      relationship between elastic stress in a ferromagnetic material
      and a change in the ferromagnetic material's magnetic properties,
      a useful feature for generating electrical power. Therefore, at
      nodal point N where the intensity of alternating elastic stress
      reaches a maximum, an alternation of ferromagnetic properties in
      resonator 200 has also reached a maximum, if resonator 200 is
      constructed of ferromagnetic material having nonzero
      magnetoelasticity. Therefore, a magnetic condition conducive for
      the magnetoelastic generation of electrical power is present at
      each nodal point N.<br>
      <br>
      Resonator 200 will also support standing acoustic waves, producing
      longitudinal mechanical resonance, at harmonics or overtones of
      this fundamental frequency. Mathematically this is equivalent to
      multiplying frequency F in the above equation by integers greater
      than 1.<br>
      <br>
      2F depicts the behavior of the identical resonator system,
      resonating at the second harmonic or resonant frequency F
      multiplied by 2 (2F). In this case a total of 4 quarter
      wavelengths are spaced along the length of resonator 200. The
      structure of the acoustic energy along the length of resonator 200
      is a full acoustic wave. As previously described, the transit of
      this acoustic wave down the length of resonator 200 and reflecting
      back along this same length to source 201 occupies two full wave
      cycles, at the frequency 2F, producing a singe full wave along the
      length of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      Antinodal points again exist at each end of resonator 200. A
      positive in-phase antinode is present at the location of
      acceleration source 201. One quarter-wavelength distant, a
      positive, or compressive-in-phase nodal point N+ is present. One
      further quarter wavelength along the length of resonator 200, an
      antinodal point of opposite sign A− is present, indicating an
      opposing longitudinal displacement occurs here. A further quarter
      wave distant from acceleration source 201, a negative or
      tensile-in-phase nodal point N− exists, followed by a final
      antinodal point A+ that is in-phase with acceleration source 201.<br>
      <br>
      It may be noted that each antinodal point A takes a sign opposing
      its immediately neighboring antinodal points A, and each nodal
      point N is of a sign opposing its immediately neighboring nodal
      points N.<br>
      <br>
      This situation is further repeated for integer harmonics 3F
      through 6F, inclusive. Each of these diagrams of FIG. 2 represent
      longitudinal acoustic resonance at the fundamental resonant
      frequency F multiplied by the number of the diagram. Diagram F6
      depicts the acoustic wave structure for resonance at six times the
      fundamental frequency, or overtone 6F. This overtone, or harmonic
      frequency, can be any integer number. If the harmonic overtone is
      taken as variable X, harmonic resonance occurs at X times F. The
      number of antinodes for a straight longitudinal acoustic resonator
      is always X+1 while the number of nodal points is always X.<br>
      <br>
      In diagram F6, six nodal points N exist with adjacently opposing
      polarities. At each successive nodal point N, magnetic conditions
      conducive for the magnetoelastic generation of electrical power
      exist. Since the polarities of elastic stresses N are opposite at
      each successive nodal point, the magnetoelastically induced
      changes in ferromagnetic properties are likewise opposite in sign
      at each successive nodal point N. The number of locations N which
      are conducive for magnetoelastic generation of electrical power is
      equal to the harmonic overtone number X, and increase as X
      increases.<br>
      <br>
      In practice material characteristics set a limit to the maximum
      number of X, while theoretically there is no limit to the overtone
      at which resonance will occur.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 depicts the resonator structure shown in FIG. 2 with a
      magnetic bias applied. Acoustic resonator structure 200 is given
      as a ferromagnetic material, which can be magnetically polarized
      and is therefore able to conduct magnetic flux. Flux sources 300
      and 301 illustrate pole pieces of an external magnet, or magnetic
      flux source, which may be a permanent magnet or electromagnet. Any
      such source of magnetic flux will produce at least one North
      magnetic pole, illustrated by North-polarized pole piece 300, and
      at least one South magnetic pole, illustrated by South-polarized
      pole piece 301. The material of pole pieces 300 and 301 may be a
      common ferromagnetic material such as iron, suitably connected to
      a permanent magnet or electromagnet, or a common permanent magnet
      material such as neodymium-iron-boron, Alnico, or a ceramic
      ferrite such as strontium ferrite, or ceramic ferrites well known
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic flux emerging from the ends of pole pieces 300 and 301
      enters the ferromagnetic material of acoustic resonator 200 and
      this flux is carried along the length of resonator 200 toward the
      pole of opposite polarity. By convention, magnetic flux is
      considered to travel from North to South poles, as indicated by
      the simple arrows following diagrammatic magnetic flux lines 302,
      indicating the flux and its course through resonator 200 made of a
      ferromagnetic material. It may be seen that, in such a condition,
      the magnetic polarization is substantially uniform along the
      length of resonator 200, particularly at its center.<br>
      <br>
      If acceleration source 201 produces longitudinal acoustic
      resonance in resonator 200 as shown in FIG. 2: F1, resulting nodal
      point N+ will be situated at the center of resonator 200 where
      uniform magnetization now exists. Nodal point N+ will produce a
      time-varying elastic stress within the ferromagnetic material of
      acoustic resonator 200. If the ferromagnetic material of resonator
      200 exhibits nonzero magnetoelasticity, the time-varying elastic
      stress N+ produces a time-varying alternation in the ferromagnetic
      properties of resonator 200. Resonator 200 is carrying a magnetic
      flux 302 along its length at the location of the acoustic node N+.
      This magnetic flux causes generally magnetic polarization of the
      ferromagnetic material of resonator 200. The specific degree of
      this polarization is dependent on the magnetic intensity of flux
      sources 300 and 301, as well as the instantaneous magnetic
      properties of ferromagnetic material 200, which now vary with time
      due to nonzero magnetoelasticity and time-varying elastic stress
      at nodal point N+.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a time-varying magnetic flux will be present at nodal
      points N which may coexist in FIG. 3, due to the sinusoidally
      alternating acceleration of acceleration source 201. When the
      frequency of this acceleration at 201 is equal to an integer
      harmonic of the resonant acoustic frequency of resonator 200, as
      generally illustrated in FIG. 2, all resulting nodal points N
      produce a time-varying magnetic flux proportional to the product
      of the intensity and sign of bias flux 302, and the intensity and
      sign of elastic stress |N|. As is well known in the art of
      electrical generators, a time-varying magnetic flux is able to
      induce EMF and electric power, in electrical conductors suitably
      exposed to the time-varying magnetic flux. Typical electrical
      generators, well known in the art, produce such time-varying
      magnetic flux by moving flux sources, or pole pieces, such as 300
      and 301 past electrical conductors suitably arranged. The present
      invention discloses means by which a time-varying magnetic flux is
      produced not by motion of magnetic sources or pole pieces, but
      instead by time-varying elastic stress within ferromagnetic
      materials polarized by a source of bias magnetic flux.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the ferromagnetic material of acoustic resonator 200
      may be a permanent magnetic material, which produces magnetic flux
      internally, and in which case pole pieces 300 and 301 are not
      necessary, the source of bias magnetic flux being internal to the
      material of resonator 200 rather than external to it.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates the wave mechanics outlined in FIG. 2: F1 in
      timeline detail, in further preparation for understanding a
      fundamental novelty of the disclosed invention.<br>
      <br>
      Time instant T1 depicts acceleration source 201 at its peak
      acceleration in the rightward direction, indicated by the
      rightward arrow within the pictorial volume of acceleration source
      201. This peak accelerating force propagates as a mechanical
      acoustic wave into acoustic resonator 200. The propagating
      momentum 400 is schematically depicted as a force accelerating
      toward the right hand side, by concentric hemicircles extending
      toward the right; while the propagation of this rightward force
      also toward the right is indicated by the diagram arrow pointing
      rightward. Two components exist: the direction of momentum in the
      acoustic wave (represented by the direction of the concentric
      circles, illustrating the wavefront) and, the direction of
      propagation of the momentum itself, indicated by the diagram
      arrow, representing the direction of wavefront travel. At time
      instant T1 the acoustic wave carrying rightward momentum
      propagates toward the right, its location at the left hand end of
      resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      At instant T2, a time equal to one quarter the resonant acoustic
      period (see FIG. 2: F1) has elapsed, and the emitted wavefront has
      propagated halfway down resonator 200. As this time instant is a
      quarter cycle after the peak rightward accelerative force of
      acceleration source 201, acceleration source at this instant one
      quarter-cycle later has reached zero, indicated by the dash line
      within the volume of acceleration source 201. While acceleration
      source 201 is at this time producing zero acceleration, the peak
      rightward-bearing acceleration has propagated as a wavefront along
      half the length of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T3 illustrates conditions one further quarter-cycle later.
      Acceleration source 201 has now reached its peak leftward
      acceleration, denoted by the leftward arrow within the pictorial
      volume of 201. The resulting acoustic wave 410 is schematically
      represented by concentric hemicircles pointing leftward, while the
      direction of propagation of this energy is rightward, as indicated
      by the diagram arrow in the wavefront symbol at 410. At this same
      time, the original wavefront 400 has reached the end of resonator
      200 and is reflected backward, taking the new designation 401 to
      reflect the change. As FIG. 1 illustrates, the reflection of this
      wave energy continues as a rightward momentum indicated by the
      direction of concentric hemicircles in wavefront symbol 401, but
      with the reversed direction of wavefront propagation, now
      indicated by a leftward arrow within wavefront symbol 401.
      Therefore, reflected original wavefront 401, produced at time
      instant T1, and subsequent wavefront 410, produced at time instant
      T3, are now propagating toward each other as time progresses.<br>

      At instant T4, wavefronts 401 and 410 have propagated toward one
      another and mutually approach at the center of resonator 200. The
      direction of wave propagation in each wavefront is opposite,
      causing their approach. As the wavefronts approach, the rightward
      momentum of T1's wavefront 401, on the right hand side, and the
      leftward momentum of T3's wavefront 410, on the left hand side,
      produce by their mutual action an elastic tensile stress at the
      center of resonator 200. This corresponds to the nodal point N+ in
      FIG. 2: F1, of which wavefront propagation diagram FIG. 4 is a
      more detailed model. In FIG. 1: F1, point N+, indicating the nodal
      region of maximal elastic stress corresponds to the center point
      of resonator 200 at FIG. 4: T4 where the wavefront energy produces
      the nodal point.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T5 indicates wavefront activity one quarter cycle further
      in time. Acceleration source 201 has now reached its positive peak
      acceleration, as in instant T1, the difference between T1 and T5
      being four units, representing four quarter-cycles, which are
      equal to one full cycle in time. At instant T5,
      leftward-propagating wavefront 401 has continued leftward,
      reaching the left end of resonator 200, and reflects at this end,
      the direction of wavefront propagation now becomes rightward. At
      this same instant T5, the peak rightward acceleration 201
      strengthens the rightward momentum already present in wavefront
      401 at the same location. The resulting wavefront of increased
      intensity takes the new designation 402, to reflect these changes:
      the reflection of the incoming wave energy 401 and an increase in
      total momentum carried by the wavefront due to further
      acceleration from acceleration source 201, in the same direction
      as the original momentum in prior wavefront 401. Meanwhile,
      wavefront 410 has reflected at the rightmost end of resonator 200,
      reversing direction of propagation, carrying the leftward momentum
      in this wavefront also leftward. The reversed direction of
      propagation of wavefront 410 is indicated by the successive
      designation of this wavefront 411, now in a leftward propagating
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      Instant T6 is conceptually equivalent to time instant T4, the
      difference between T4 and T6 being two units, or two quarter
      cycles, equal to one half cycle. T6 represents the activity at T4
      in the opposite polarity, producing a nodal point again at the
      center of resonator 200 and with the opposite, now compressive,
      elastic stress at this nodal point. This compressive stress is due
      to the rightward momentum in wavefront 402, approaching from left,
      with the leftward momentum of wavefront 411, approaching from the
      right. This produces a nodal point at the center of resonator 200
      which is one-half cycle, or 180 degrees of the wave, later, thus
      being of opposite sign but equal intensity.<br>
      <br>
      T7 illustrates the wavefront activity one quarter cycle subsequent
      to T6, where wavefront 411 has reflected at the left end of
      resonator 200 with further increase in intensity from the leftward
      acceleration of acceleration source 201, and taking successive
      designation as wavefront 412 to reflect the increase in total
      momentum of this wavefront, and the reversal of propagation
      direction due to reflection. Wavefront 402 has likewise reflected
      at the right hand end of resonator 200, its reversal in direction
      due to reflection giving it the successive designation 403. As the
      unit difference between T7 and T3 is also four units, or four
      quarter cycles equaling one full cycle or 360 degrees of the wave,
      the illustrated activity at T7 may be taken as equal to the action
      at instant T3 and progress further onward to T4, etc., progressing
      onward by quarter cycles to T7 and repeating indefinitely. The
      momentum of the two counter-propagating wavefronts 400+n and 410+n
      continues (where n represents successive continuation of the
      process illustrated), until the increasing momentum in each
      wavefront reaches equilibrium against practical acoustic losses
      and the finite accelerating force, or finite mechanical
      compliance, of a practical acceleration source 201.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 schematically illustrates a fundamental novelty of the
      disclosed invention, originally described above under “Summary of
      the Invention”, section [B]: Magnetostrictive Positive Feedback.
      The schematic illustration of this activity in FIG. 5 may be taken
      as an extension of the wave mechanics described in FIG. 1: F1, as
      illustrated diagrammatically in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5: T1 begins at the same point illustrated in FIG. 4: T3,
      where original propagating wavefront 400 has reflected at the
      rightmost end of resonator 200 becoming wavefront 401 with
      reversed propagation direction, and where subsequent wavefront 410
      has been established also. As in FIG. 4: T3, FIG. 5: T1 depicts
      the same instant where these two counter-propagating wavefronts
      are both present and propagating toward each other, to meet at the
      center of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 3, a bias magnetic flux is provided along the
      length of resonator 200 which is made of a ferromagnetic material
      having, for purposes of discussion, both a positive
      magnetoelasticicity, and positive magnetostriction, such as
      Metglas alloy 2605SA1 or 2605SC (Metglas Inc., Conway, S.C.).
      Since ferromagnetic resonator 200 material exhibits positive
      magnetoelasticity, compressive stress in the material produces a
      decrease in magnetic susceptibility while tensile stress produces
      an increase in magnetic susceptibility. Since ferromagnetic
      resonator 200 material exhibits positive magnetostriction, the
      material expands with increasing magnetic fields; increasing flux
      densities produce elongation of the material in the direction of
      the magnetic flux.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic bias shown in FIG. 3 is again present, due to flux
      sources or pole-pieces 300 and 301, but with the illustrative
      magnetic polarization lines omitted from the present diagram for
      clarity.<br>
      <br>
      At instant T2A, acoustic wavefronts 401 and 410 have reached the
      center of resonator 200, producing a nodal point of tensile
      elastic stress. This tensile stress increases the magnetic
      susceptibility of the ferromagnetic material of resonator 200,
      causing the flux density at the nodal point to increase via
      magnetoelastically increased magnetic susceptibility. A single
      turn of conductive material, such as copper, is shown wrapped in a
      loop enclosing this nodal point. 500 and 501 indicate this
      conductive single turn, cut in cross section, where 500 indicates
      the upper portion of the loop and 501 indicates its lower portion
      in the viewing plane. The changing magnetic field creates an
      electric field 510 indicated by the diagram arrow between 500 and
      501 in diagram T2A. Thus, the action of acoustic waves in
      ferromagnetic resonator 200 have resulted in the production of an
      electric field 510 in conductive loop 500-501 due to the bias
      magnetic flux within the ferromagnetic material being modulated by
      magnetoelastic sensitivity to stresses resulting from resonant
      acoustic waves.<br>
      <br>
      When an electrical current 511 is allowed to flow through
      conductive loop 500-501, the direction of the electric current
      flows in a direction opposing and neutralizing the causative
      electric field indicated in diagram T2A, as depicted by the
      diagram arrow of current flow 511. A flow of electric current
      always generates a magnetic field. Since the current 511 flows in
      a direction which tends to neutralize the electric field 510
      generated by the changing magnetic flux, the current flow 511 also
      generates a magnetic field which tends to oppose and neutralize
      the originally changing magnetic field, opposing its change. This
      activity is commonly referred to in the art as Lenz's Law.<br>
      <br>
      The original change in magnetic field at instant T2A is an
      increase in magnetic flux due to tensile stress at the nodal
      point, increasing the magnetic susceptibility of the ferromagnetic
      material of resonator 200. Induced current flow 511 will act to
      oppose this increase in magnetic flux represented by induced
      electric field 510; therefore the magnetic field generated by the
      induced current 511 flowing within conductive loop 500-501 will
      attempt to create a field decreasing the total magnetic flux, at
      least partially canceling the original increase. This induced
      magnetic field also acts on the ferromagnetic material of
      resonator 200, which has positive magnetostriction. Since positive
      magnetostriction implies an elongation of the material with
      increasing flux density, the induced current is decreasing the
      flux density to restore equilibrium and therefore produces a
      contraction of, and thus a compressive reaction force within, the
      ferromagnetic material of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      While the “A” in T2A stands for “action” at time T2, the “R” in
      T2R represents a depiction of the opposing reaction forces at this
      identical time instant T2. Whereas incoming acoustic wavefronts
      401 and 410 create tensile stress at the nodal point in T4A, the
      new acoustic wavefronts 420 and 421 indicate the compressive
      reaction stress caused by magnetic induction acting on a
      magnetostrictive material in T2R.<br>
      <br>
      Incoming acoustic wavefronts 401 and 410 in action diagram T2A
      contain diagram arrows indicating a mutually inbound propagation
      direction, where both wavefronts are converging at the nodal point
      at the center of resonator 200. Wavefronts 401 and 410 are
      approaching the central nodal point at instant T2A, having
      traveled inward from the ends of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      In reaction diagram T2R, reaction wavefronts 420 and 421 share a
      mutual origin at the nodal point, where ferromagnetic
      magnetostriction has newly created these wavefronts due to
      magnetic induction, as Lenz's Law acting on a magnetostrictive
      material. Therefore the reaction wavefronts 420 and 421 each have
      propagation-direction arrows indicating outbound propagation from
      the nodal point at the center of resonator 200, toward respective
      ends of resonator 200.<br>
      <br>
      Since reaction wavefronts 420 and 421 constitute acoustic pressure
      opposite to that of incoming acoustic wavefronts 401 and 410, the
      phase of the reaction wavefronts may be considered to be 180
      degrees out of phase, or opposite of, the phase of the incoming
      wavefronts 401 and 410. The reaction wavefronts constitute
      additional acoustic energy which is 180 degrees out of phase with
      the original acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      The nodal point where this reaction occurs is one-quarter acoustic
      wavelength distant from the acceleration source 201 driving the
      interaction. Thus, the phase of the wave activity at the nodal
      point is already shifted 90 degrees, or one-quarter cycle, behind
      the phase of the sinusoidally varying acceleration of source 201.
      The wave energy at the nodal point lags by 90 degrees of a cycle,
      and the reaction wavefronts produced by current flow in conductive
      coil 500-501 constitute an additional 180 degree phase shift,
      since the reaction wavefronts constitute opposition to incoming
      wavefronts. Therefore, the net phase of the reaction wavefronts
      emerging from the nodal point lags a total of 270 degrees, or
      three-quarters of a cycle, behind the phase of acceleration source
      201. It should be remembered that the wavefronts in this
      description are not single events, but indicate the peaks of a
      sinusoidal wave in all cases.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction wavefront 421 propagates leftward after its creation,
      toward acceleration source 201, over a distance equal to
      one-quarter the acoustic wavelength. Due to the finite acoustic
      propagation velocity, reaction wavefront 421 is delayed a further
      90 degrees, or one-quarter cycle, by the time it reaches the
      leftmost end of resonator 200 and attached acceleration source
      201. Upon arrival, the additional 90 degree phase shift adds to
      the previous shift, or cycle delay, of 270 degrees, producing a
      total phase shift of 360 degrees, or one full cycle, which is
      mathematically equal to a phase shift of 0 degrees, or no phase
      shift at all.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, reaction wavefront 421 arrives at the acceleration
      source 201 with a phase that is identical to the phase of the
      acceleration source 201. Whereas a 180 degree phase shift would
      constitute opposition of the acceleration, or destructive wave
      interference, a 360 degree or 0 degree phase shift constitutes
      addition to the acceleration, or constructive wave interference.
      Although destructive wave interference occurs at the nodal point
      due to the nature of magnetic opposition expressed in Lenz's Law,
      having translated to mechanical opposition via the properties of
      magnetoelasticity and magnetostriction, the additional phase delay
      of 90 degrees for acoustic wavefronts incoming and outbound from
      the nodal region constitutes an additional total phase shift of
      180 degrees, the sum being 360 degrees, one full cycle, therefore
      zero phase difference between action and reaction at the site of
      acceleration source 201. The in-phase nature of action and
      reaction constitute constructive wave interference and addition of
      forces, rather than destructive wave interference or opposition of
      forces.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, when current is allowed to flow through conductive
      single turn 500-501, additional wavefront energy is ultimately
      present at acceleration source 201, aiding the acceleration and
      longitudinal displacement at the leftmost end of resonator 200
      where acceleration source 201 is located. Since the accelerating
      force is now being aided, or has a secondary wavefront present
      which is in-phase with the phase of the acceleration itself, the
      resonant wave in resonator 200 may be maintained with less
      acceleration input from source 201 than was necessary before
      current was allowed to flow in conductive loop 500-501.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, conductive loop 500-501 will have many turns of
      conductive metal wire, such as copper wire, functioning as a
      generator coil supplying electrical energy to a device requiring a
      power source. To the extent which electrical current flows in this
      closed circuit, acceleration source 201 will be aided by the
      actions described above, thereby requiring less energy to produce
      said acceleration as a source, since some of the accelerating
      activity is now self-produced by the inventive process hereby
      disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      At this same instant T3, complimentary reaction wavefront 420 has
      propagated to the rightmost end of resonator 200, reflecting at
      this rightmost end with successive designation 430 indicating the
      reflection.<br>
      <br>
      A further quarter-cycle later, at instant T4A, the conditions
      described above for instant T2A are again present, but with
      reversed momentum. At instant T4A, the incoming acoustic energy
      produces compressive stress at the nodal point. The resonator
      material defined in this illustration has positive
      magnetoelasticity, such that compressive stress causes a decrease
      in magnetic susceptibility, thereby causing a decrease in total
      magnetic bias polarization, or a decreasing magnetic flux.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction T4R indicates the opposition to this set of
      conditions. The decreasing magnetic flux in T4A is opposed by
      magnetic induction, or current flow in conductive turn 500-501,
      causing a secondary magnetic field which opposes the change in
      magnetic flux, or a secondary induced magnetic flux which tends to
      cause an increase in total magnetic flux, by attempting to oppose
      the magnetoelastically generated decrease. The action of
      attempting to increase the total magnetic flux will elongate the
      ferromagnetic material of resonator 200, since the
      magnetostriction is positive. This elongation is indicated by the
      reaction wavefronts 440 and 441, whose outward-going momentum is
      consistent with elongation of the material.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated beforehand by time instant T3, the time instant T5
      which is one-quarter cycle subsequent to instants T4, depicts
      propagation of reaction wavefront 440 back toward acceleration
      source 201, again with an additional 90 degree or quarter-cycle
      delay due to the finite acoustic propagation velocity during this
      time. At instant T5, the leftward momentum of wavefront 440 has
      reached acceleration source 201 which is now in its peak of
      leftward acceleration; the two accelerations once again assist
      each other mutually. The reflection of this acoustic wavefront at
      the leftward boundary of resonator 200 reverses the propagation
      direction of wavefront 440 causing the wavefront to take the
      successive designation 450 in diagram T5.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile at time instant T5, complimentary reaction acoustic
      wavefront, generated by magnetostrictive activity, has reached the
      rightmost end of resonator 200 and reflects, reversing propagation
      direction, and taking the successive designation 451. Time instant
      T5 is effectively identical to time instant T1, as the difference
      between T1 and T5 is 4 units, or 4 quarter-cycles, or a full
      cycle. The cycle thus repeats with T1 being equal to T5, and so
      on.<br>
      <br>
      Each time a nodal point is created, at instants T2 or T4, reaction
      forces are produced which create reaction acoustic wavefronts in
      the magnetostrictive material of resonator 200. Owing to the
      finite propagation velocity of the acoustic energy, the arrival of
      all such reaction wavefronts at acceleration source 201
      consistently results in wave energy that is substantially in-phase
      with the acceleration source itself, effectively providing an
      independent source of mechanical acceleration or acoustic wave
      energy identical to that produced by acceleration source 201 which
      provides such energy by external means. When conductive turn
      500-501 is allowed to support a current flow in a closed circuit,
      this second source of acoustic energy is caused to exist.<br>
      <br>
      This self-reinforcing magneto-acoustic wave interaction is
      strongly dependent on the phase of the electrical current allowed
      to flow through conductive turn, or turns 500-501. The phase of
      electrical current flow may be adjusted by connecting a capacitor
      in series or in parallel with conductive turn(s) 500-501,
      producing capacitive reactive impedance which cancels or offsets
      the inductive impedance of conductive turn or turns 500-501. By
      use of appropriate tuning, where necessary, the phase of induced
      electrical current may be adjusted to produce the constructive
      interference of acoustic energy described above.<br>
      <br>
      This constructive wave interference is also dependent on the
      magnetoelastic properties of the magnetic material constituting
      resonator 200. In the above description, both magnetoelasticity
      and magnetostriction are positive in sign. Certain elements such
      as Nickel, or alloys such as samarium ferrite (SmFe2) exhibit
      negative magnetostriction but also exhibit negative
      magnetoelasticity. In either case, the sign of magnetoelastic and
      magnetostrictive action are identical, and the wave interaction
      described above will continue to occur. If the sign of
      magnetoelastic and magnetostrictive properties were opposite, the
      above interaction could not occur, but materials having oppositely
      signed magnetostriction and magnetoelasticity are not presently
      thought to exist.<br>
      <br>
      The above illustration concerns operation at the fundamental
      resonant frequency F1 described and depicted in FIG. 2. It may be
      understood the same overall reaction continues to manifest at
      higher harmonic overtones, although illustration and description
      of this activity becomes increasingly complex. The essential
      mechanics of such interaction are given by the above discussion,
      and apply to operation at higher harmonic overtones shown in FIG.
      2.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 illustrates an additional benefit gained by operating the
      disclosed invention at F2, the second harmonic overtone, or twice
      the fundamental resonant frequency. The conditions illustrated in
      FIG. 5 continue to apply, such that the acoustic wave interference
      may become constructively self-reinforcing. FIG. 6 constitutes an
      illustration of the summary description given above in “Summary of
      the Invention”, section [A]: Lenz Field Addition.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2: F2, operation at a second harmonic overtone
      creates dual nodal points in resonator 200, both of which are
      spaced one-quarter acoustic wavelength from respective ends of
      resonator 200, while being one-half acoustic wavelength distant
      from each other, within the resonator. The polarity of elastic
      stress at each nodal point is opposite the other: while nodal
      point N+ in FIG. 2: F2 may be at a particular instant produce
      compressive stress, the opposite nodal point N− will exhibit a
      complimentarily tensile stress.<br>
      <br>
      In a material having positive magnetoelasticity and a bias flux
      from flux sources or pole pieces 300 and 301, these dual nodal
      points cause opposing changes in magnetic flux density at their
      respective locations. Nodal point N+ may produce compressive
      stress, reducing the total flux density local to this node, while
      complimentary nodal point N− will, at the same time produce
      tensile stress, increasing the total flux density local to this
      complimentary, opposing node. It may be recognized the same
      opposition will occur in ferromagnetic materials having negative
      magnetoelasticity, although the relationship between the sign of
      stress and the sign of flux density change will reverse.<br>
      <br>
      Since the two nodal points produce opposing changes in the
      magnetic flux local to each node, magnetically induced electric
      fields 510 and 512 will likewise oppose. Since there are two nodal
      points, two conductive turns 500-501 and 502-503 are provided,
      again shown in cross section, each carrying diagrammatical arrows
      indicating the opposing current flow within either conductive
      turn.<br>
      <br>
      Since the secondary reaction magnetic field produced by current
      flow in a conductive turn has a magnetic polarity determined by
      the direction of current flow, the reaction magnetic field from
      each conductive turn, 500-501 and 502-503, oppose and mutually
      annihilate, over the length of ferromagnetic resonator 200. The
      material of resonator 200 immediately within the bore of the
      conductive turns continues to respond to the flux produced by the
      conductive turn wrapped around its immediate vicinity. If such
      material has magnetostriction equal to the sign of its
      magnetoelasticity, the constructive wave interference depicted in
      FIG. 5 remains present.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical power available from the disclosed invention may be
      limited by the inductive reactance of conductive turns,
      particularly when the turns are multiple, as in a generator in
      accordance with the invention being reduced to practice, or
      designed to generate high voltages necessitating many conductive
      turns wound in place of a single turn. The resulting electrical
      inductance can upset the phase relationships necessary to produce
      constructive wave interference, as well as limiting the total
      current deliverable by the conductive turns, to an electrical
      load.<br>
      <br>
      When two or more conductive turns are wound around opposing nodal
      points, the opposing currents in each tend to cancel the inductive
      reactance of each conductive turn and their total inductive
      reactance within the generator as a whole. The cancellation of
      inductive reactance results in a greater power available from the
      disclosed invention.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the mutually opposing current flows may be recognized
      as identical to those which occur in a single-phase power
      transformer of conventional design, where current in a secondary
      coil that is powering an electrical load opposes the direction of,
      and thereby increases the current flow within, the primary coil
      initiating the magnetic activity of the transformer. Each mutually
      opposing current flow 511 and 513, depicted in FIG. 6 acts as a
      transformer primary to the opposite conductive turn, causing the
      total electrical power generated in each conductive turn to
      increase when both turns are conducting induced currents. By this
      mechanism, an electrical load drawing an increasing amount of
      electrical energy from induced current flow in conductive turn
      500-501, for example, causes an automatic increase in the
      electrical power delivered simultaneously by conductive turn
      502-503. This mutually-reinforcing magnetic interaction, due to
      the destructive interference of Lenz's Law magnetic opposition, is
      produced additionally to the mutually reinforcing acoustic wave
      interference previously described in the sections above, further
      increasing the electrical power generated by the invention
      disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism by which this occurs is illustrated by long diagram
      arrows 313 and 323 which represent the direction of reaction
      magnetic flux from each conductive turn, conducting the induced
      electrical current. The opposing current flows create magnetic
      fields which also oppose, as shown by the opposite directions of
      magnetic field vector arrows 313 and 323. These fields tend to
      annihilate to zero net magnetic flux at location 330, neutralizing
      any net magnetic reaction flux along the total length of resonator
      200, thereby reducing the parasitic inductive reactance to small
      value. The reaction magnetic field 313, for example due to current
      flow in conductive turn 500-501, acts as a generator field to the
      conductive turn 502-503, while the reaction magnetic field 323 due
      to current flow in conductive turn 502-503 acts as a magnetic
      field generating additional electric current in conductive turn
      500-501. The reaction magnetic field in each conductive turn
      causes a generating action in the other conductive turn.<br>
      <br>
      The wave interaction simultaneously utilizing more than one
      harmonic overtone, described at “Summary of the Invention”,
      section [C]: Harmonic Addition, may be applied to the interactions
      illustrated in either FIG. 5 or FIG. 6. Whereas the illustrations
      as shown rely on a single frequency and single set of nodal stress
      points, for the sake of a simple illustration, a combination of
      harmonic overtone frequencies may also be used, which result in
      nodal points superimposed at the various locations shown in FIG. 2
      for each harmonic overtone that is simultaneously present. By such
      means the total electrical power generated by the disclosed
      invention may be substantially increased. This method requires
      that the energy in each overtone produce constructive wave
      interference or simultaneous addition of wave peaks, at each nodal
      point rather than subtraction of peaks as is typical of
      destructive wave interference. Constructive harmonic interference
      is achieved when the phase of each overtone frequency is aligned
      such that the peaks of each harmonic wave simultaneously coincide
      with the like-sign peaks of all other harmonics simultaneously
      present in the expanded series.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of example, the single-node fundamental resonance
      utilized in FIG. 4 or FIG. 5 may be expanded to a harmonic series
      including harmonic overtones 1, 3, 5, and odd higher integers as
      is practical; it will be seen that the combination of odd
      overtones in this case results in a central node as the sum of all
      overtones, with the addition of minor nodal points at positions to
      the right and left of center. This view is created by
      superimposing the nodal structures of F1, F3, and F5 of FIG. 2 in
      a single common resonator 200, depicting the wave structure that
      results when these harmonics are simultaneously present. When the
      relative phase of each harmonic is appropriately aligned, wave
      peaks of all harmonic overtones will occur synchronously with the
      lowest harmonic overtone, causing addition of the total wave
      energy present at the peaks of the lowest overtone, creating a
      substantial increase of available generated electricity as
      described in the Summary section [C], above.<br>
      <br>
      In a likewise manner, the dual node topology shown by FIG. 6 may
      be harmonically expanded to include overtone frequency multiples
      2, 4, 6, and higher even-order integer multiples as is practical;
      it will be seen the combination of even overtones by superposition
      results in two major nodes, whose position is defined by the
      lowest harmonic overtone, and which contain energy across the
      entire harmonic series. Minor nodal points may exist which do not
      include the total harmonic energy; these minor nodes may also be
      enclosed by conductive turns in order to contribute to the total
      output of the disclosed invention as a generator, or provide
      additional electrical outputs. Such minor nodes may also be left
      free without negatively impacting operation of the invention.
      There is no theoretical limit on this expansion of the harmonic
      series, which may include very high order overtones that are
      substantial multiples of the fundamental resonant frequency. In
      practice, extremely high frequency overtones are often undesirable
      as they contribute successively less energy to the generated
      electrical output, and the extent of the harmonic series to be
      used in practice is determined by the point of diminishing
      returns.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows an embodiment designed to harvest power from a source
      710 of vibratory energy. Ferrite rod 700 is coupled to the
      vibratory energy source 710 at one end, the other end being
      unconstrained except for support. The length of the rod is trimmed
      to resonate at the vibratory frequency or a harmonic multiple
      thereof; alternately, the driven frequency of vibratory energy
      source 710 is adjusted to match the resonant frequency of the rod
      700. If resonating at the fundamental frequency, a standing
      pressure wave will develop within the rod, creating a node, or
      maximum of pressure at the center. If resonance is at a harmonic
      multiple of the fundamental frequency, two or more nodal points
      will develop having maximum pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Bridging this nodal point is a permanent magnet or array of
      magnets 701, shown here for clarity as a single U-shaped magnet
      having North and South poles. Lines of magnetic flux 702 are shown
      completing the magnetic circuit axially through ferrite rod 700.
      An electrical conductor, such as the coil of wire 720, is wound
      around the core centered at the nodal point and connected to
      electrical load 730, shown here as a resistor.<br>
      <br>
      Through magnetoelastic action the magnetic flux in the rod is
      modulated by the pressure variation and results in an induced
      current in coil 720 through Faraday's Law. The resulting EMF at
      the coil terminals is converted to current through load resistor
      730 according to Ohm's Law and results in the delivery of power in
      the form of heat. Resistor 730 may be replaced with any electronic
      or electric circuit, including rectifiers, power converters, and
      voltage regulators.<br>
      <br>
      Coil 720 must be sized so that its inductance, together with the
      load resistance, does not present excessive electrical impedance
      to the induced power at the vibratory frequency. The inductance of
      the coil may be compensated for by a capacitance 731 sufficient to
      resonate the coil at the vibratory frequency. The strength of the
      magnetic field must be adjusted to produce maximum response
      through the magnetoelastic effect.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows the magnetoelastic generator of FIG. 7 resonating at
      the second harmonic of the fundamental longitudinal resonant
      frequency, thereby producing two nodal points having opposing
      acoustic pressure. The rod is coupled to a piezoelectric element
      810 capable of developing pressure at its faces 813a and 813b
      under control of an alternating electric field between electrode
      plates 814a and 814b, driven from external oscillator and driver
      circuit 815. Acoustic horn 811 is trimmed to one quarter the
      vibratory wavelength and produces maximum displacement at the
      vibratory frequency at the driven end of the rod 800, in response
      to the alternating pressure developed by piezoelectric element
      810. Piezoelectric element 810 is terminated with a back mass 812
      whose density and acoustic length have been chosen to develop
      maximal longitudinal displacement at the junction between horn 811
      and rod 800 while maximizing electrical efficiency of
      piezoelectric element 810 at the operating frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Ferrite rod 800 is driven to acoustic resonance at the second
      harmonic of its fundamental resonant frequency by acoustic horn
      811, resulting in acoustic wave 816 within the rod having two
      nodal points. Each nodal point exhibits instantaneous acoustic
      pressure opposite the other nodal point. Bias magnet 801 produces
      magnetic flux 802 extending axially through both nodal points
      developed within rod 800. Since both nodal points within the rod
      develop oppositely signed instantaneous acoustic pressure, the
      electromotive force developed via the magnetoelastic effect at
      each nodal point is oppositely directed. Coils 820 and 821 are
      wound oppositely and connected in electrical series, such that
      their developed electromotive forces add. The sum electromotive
      force of coils 820 and 821 develops electrical current and power
      in resistive load 830. The reactive impedance of coils 820 and 821
      is reduced by their mutually opposite inductive polarities, and is
      further corrected to unity power factor by capacitor 831, such
      that maximum electrical power is developed across resistive load
      830.<br>

      Hello, for those of you being a few years already in the free
      energy scene and being<br>
      on my old Yahoogroups list, you probably remember Graham
      Gunderson,<br>
      who did a lot of research in strange coils setups and who claimed
      to have<br>
      invented a dragless generator..<br>
      ..it is no a mechanical generator, but a solid state overunity
      type transformer...!<br>
      It seems it is required that all 3 fields,<br>
      input coil field , Permanent magnet field and output coil<br>
      field must be in 90 degrees orthogonal relationship to each other,<br>
      so 2 of them can cancel out, which is the output coil field with
      the<br>
      permanent magnet field, so the input coil?s<br>
      field is not much affected and thus no drag is put onto the input
      coil?s field.<br>
      Is this correct ?<br>
      It is pretty complicated to grasp.<br>
      Regards, Stefan.<br>
      <br>

      Comment:&nbsp; It appears to me that the magnets are on top of the
      ring and also in attract on the bottom of the ring.&nbsp; (Flux
      flowing vertically through the ring from Permanent magnet to
      Permanent magnet).&nbsp; Then the coil that weaves in and out
      horizontally through the center of the ring between flux flow
      points collects the magnetic flux change caused by the input 'push
      coil' of the other vertically wound coil around the ring.&nbsp;
      The collector coil receives the "pushed/deflected" magnetic flux,
      causing an induced current in the horizontal looped winding for
      output.&nbsp; Apparently more power is able to be collected in the
      output coil than is expended in the excite 'push' coil.&nbsp; It
      also appears that one can stack these devices, making better use
      of the magnet<br>
      <br>
      Reply #4 on: July 28, 2006<br>
      I think, as the counter field from the output current will stay
      inside the core, the permanent magnets from Graham's patent will
      not demagnetize as the field will never<br>
      go to the level of -Hc which would be required to weaken the
      magnets...<br>
      So I guess this is a very safe unit which will not demagnetize the
      magnets in our live-time.<br>
      I think this is the smartest design of a solid state free energy
      device I have seen so far and indeed I always trusted Graham to be
      a genuine inventor with all his very clever<br>
      ideas and smart thinking and experiments.<br>
      He also had a real mechanical dragless generator already a few
      years back, which was a mechanical design, but had too many losses
      in the gears he was using, he told me at this time..<br>

      Read this page describing the patent posted above by hartiberlin:
      http://magneticpowerinc.com/patent.html<br>
      Mark Goldes says " Following construction of a successful
      prototype, a U.S. patent application was filed covering this
      advanced electrical generator."<br>
      To me that means that the device indeed works, and if the device
      does indeed work, then this is IT.<br>
      My ONLY QUESTION for Mark Goldes would be:<br>
      The patent states that the magnets can become demagnetized, was
      this a necessary addition for trying to get the Patent office to
      pass the Patent, or do the magnets really become demagnetized?<br>
      AND<br>
      If the magnets become demagnetized, how long, or, how much energy
      could be used from a given setup before the magnets lost thier
      magnetization?<br>
      It would be interesting to see output figures per module (to know
      how many modules are needed to produce a given amount of power)
      and approx. cost per module.&nbsp; Also Tao's question about
      magnet life would be nice to know the answer to.&nbsp; <br>

      Quote from: tao on July 28, 2006<br>
      I'd say the easiest way would be to buy a nice toroidal
      transformer core and drill holes in it.<br>
      Place the proper amount of NdFeb magnets on the core above the
      proper holes.<br>
      Wind the output wire(magnet wire) through the holes and wind the
      input wire(magnet wire) around the whole unit, magnets and all(as
      the patent suggests).<br>
      Power the thing with a series resonant circuit like the patent
      suggests and power a load indefinitely...<br>
      Yes, Tao, this is the same, what I also just thought, how to do
      it. The question is, how big in diameter the holes should be
      maximum and if it is better to have many output coil windings
      going through the holes with very small diameter wire or just
      lower turns with bigger diameter wire, so if it is much better to
      go for more output voltage or more output current. <br>
      Normally you get the maximum output power out of a power supply or
      device, if you use the same load resistance as the inner
      resistance of the device, so if you want to get 100 Watts out, you
      would also heat the output windings with 100 Watts too, if the
      impedances match !<br>
      So this is why normally you don?t match the inner resistance with
      the load resistance,<br>
      so less output power is drawn&nbsp; but then also the wasted inner
      resistance power is also much less.<br>
      But for the input coils I would use very big diameter wire and
      only use about 10 to 100 Windings or so, to have a very low ohmic
      resistance and also low inductance, so the frequency could be put
      into the Khz range.<br>
      If you use a higher frequency you will also get more voltage and
      thus more power out.<br>
      Thus with a matched capacitance at the resonance frequency of the
      input LC circuit you would need very low input power and due to
      low ohmic resistance of the coil would<br>
      have low ohmic losses at the resonance frequency for the input
      current.<br>
      The question I still have, is, if it is better to<br>
      1. use many holes in short distances and thus have more voltage at
      lower turn windingsnumbers and use only smaller sized magnets
      ontop and onbottom of the core<br>
      or<br>
      2. have less holes in the core with bigger hole diameters and have
      thus more winding-turn-numbers through them for higher output
      voltage and have less and bigger magnets on them ?<br>
      What is better, 1. or 2. ?<br>
      <br>

      As with most patents (applications) you don't have to give away
      the secret and it appears from reading the application that they
      do not. Why is this so different from the MEG? Special core
      material, yes they say soft iron, but I doubt its what you get at
      the scrap yard. The timing appears to be critical, you will not be
      able to just throw it together and get power, you will have to
      work out the math so it works as proposed.<br>
      My question is, was it on purpose that they did not indicate that
      the loop can be closed? They do say that Lenz did not apply, but
      so why not go all the way and say once it starts is self powers?
      Did not see mention in the application.<br>
      Additionally they are saying in the app that they are covering all
      forms (shapes) and methods, would this not if granted stop any one
      else from using perm magnets in a device?<br>

      Hi all,<br>
      About a month ago I won on Ebay three current transformers.&nbsp;
      Stated that they had 800:5 current ratio.&nbsp; I thought that
      they were a toroidal transformer with 800 turns primary and 5
      turns secondary.&nbsp; I opened one up and was disappointed that
      all they were was a ferrite core about 4 inches ID and only one
      coil about 18 guage wound around the core.&nbsp; This explained
      why there were only two leads instead of 4.<br>
      I was disappointed and said to myself "well there goes $20 for
      something I will probably never use."<br>
      And now comes this thread and these ferrite cores and wire are
      exactly what I need to build this device!<br>
      I don't know what a ferrite core with a diameter of 4 to 5 inches
      would normally cost, but I got three of these current transformers
      for $20.&nbsp; There might be others available?<br>
      Does anyone know how to drill a hole through a ferrite core?&nbsp;
      They are probably very brittle and fragile?<br>
      I am thinking of getting diamond drills and starting with small
      holes first.<br>

      Don't throw 'em away yet!<br>
      Current transformers require the primary to be looped through the
      hole in the core.&nbsp; If yours is 800:5, you take your primary
      wire and loop it through the hole 5 times.&nbsp; You can
      effectively get different ratios by changing the number of times
      you loop your primary through the coil.<br>
      Note that to put one turn on the primary, you must stick the wire
      through the hole two times.&nbsp; If you put the wire through only
      once you don't have a complete "turn" on the primary.&nbsp; You
      must have one loop through the device to have one turn.&nbsp; So,
      to get 5 turns you have to go through the hole 6 times with the
      primary lead.<br>
      I have only ever seen this type of transformer used to sense motor
      current in large ac motors.&nbsp; The motor lead is directly wound
      through the device to form the primary.<br>

      Hello Everyone,<br>
      This my first post here at Overunity.com, I have been developing a
      version of the Gunderson solid state generator for personal
      research purposes.&nbsp; I'm very excited about this generator,
      and yes Tao, I feel that THIS IS IT! too.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      I have built a linear 'proof of principal' of the Gunderon
      generator. Consisting of a linear silicon steel laminate core
      containing 5 magnets and 2 input coils the output wire is a single
      pass of insulated braided copper wire. The magnets are 7mm x 3mm
      neo's I had. The core is a stack of 21 11mm laminates from a 12v
      4amp charger transfromer and the input coils are wound from the
      primary windings of that same tranformer. I only ha to drill 3
      holes in the laminates since they already had one at each end. I
      used cyanoacrylate glue and a vice to make the stack, solid.<br>
      <br>
(http://timeisart.net/free_energy/multi_dimensioanl_gunderson_linear_test.JPG)<br>
      <br>
      The purple and green wires are for input.&nbsp; Only the two
      copper coils nearest the center of the device are hooked up, I
      wound all 4 input coils then I realised that the 2 outer ones
      would heat up because they were just pushing against the end
      magnets which are unable to shift there flux&nbsp; because they
      lack a "balancing magnet" because this is a linear&nbsp; device
      not a ring .&nbsp; Sure enough when I powered it up the outer
      coils got hot quite quickly while the inner two remained cool. So
      I disconnected them. The use of 5 magnets is nessesary to allow
      the device to have a functioning middle section with magnets that
      have their flux divided equally in two.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      I have meassured 184mV RMS from the output of this device when
      excited with .6v AC 50Hz. Small output I know. However I could
      make consistant voltage spikes of 3 to 4v when I rapidly connected
      and desconnected the input power and occasionally higher spikes in
      the 14v range. Despite what may seem like a tiny output I am
      encoaraged.&nbsp; I made these measurments on a quality digital
      ossciloscope at a freinds house using only a AC/AC transformer at
      50Hz to excite the input coils.<br>
      Since then I have used a small audio amp to power the coils.
      Connected to the soundcard on my PC and a tone generator to
      generate a square wave at different frequencies. Unfortunatly my
      multimeter is not accurate enough to get a reading. But I have had
      a alot of fun testing the resonant frequencies of the device. I am
      able to feel the magnetic field occilations by holding a magnet
      near the device. Or sticking a laminate to the magnets to get a
      audiable feedback of the vibation. The qualitative sence of
      vibration strength of the magnet I was holding seemed to peak
      around 200hz, at least on the level I could feel. Then there were
      overtones at heaps of frequences up to over 64 0000Hz that seemed
      to peak the vibration and or sound output. All I can do without
      proper equipment is make qualitative observations and work on
      instinct ;)<br>
      My linear proof of principal device has many inheirent flaws, Yet
      I am seeing an output.&nbsp; I used magnets that are far too small
      based on the ratios I could determine from the patent diagrams and
      the silicon steel laminates that make up the core seem to block
      the field so much that the flux is barely noticeable when I place
      an iron nail in the holes that carry the output wire. Also the
      linear configuration means that only the middle 3 holes and
      magnets are functioning as they would in the toroidal device as
      the magnets at the ends&nbsp; have no balance magnet and thus
      their flux dose not so easily shift.<br>
      The vibrating magnetic field that can be felt when one holds a
      magnet near the operating device is very large for such small
      input coils. In fact, if the input coils are excited without the
      magnets in place. The field that can be felt by holding a magnet
      near them is miniscule. Demonstrating to me that this
      configeration is very efficient for shifting a large perminant
      magnet flux with small input.<br>
      I think that a critial aspect of this design is in the way that
      the magnets are posistioned relative to each other. Each magnets
      flux is equally divided between 2 other magnets on the other side
      of the core, so that the 2 rings of magnets are effectivly
      balancing against each other and only a small nudge from the input
      field makes one flux path FAR MORE favorable so the flux is
      effectivly on a see saw that can be actuated with a small input.<br>
      <br>
      Given this reasoning the Torroidal configeration is nessesary to
      allow all magnets to be balanced.<br>
      <br>
      Hartiberlin; my inital feeling and answer to your earlier question
      is number 2&nbsp; One big hole for output, diameter of 1/3 the
      height of the core. but with an output wire that makes many passes
      around the core untill the hole is filled. I am not skilled in
      transformer coil calculations. Perhaps someone can help. I want to
      make input coils of 4 to 8 Ohms so that they can be driven through
      an audio amp for inital testing untill the resonant circuit can be
      implemented. I figure that multiple passes or turns in the output
      coil will improve power out as more copper and or turns&nbsp; is
      present to collect EMF. The permiabilty of the core seeems to be a
      major factor. I belive the patent talks about resin bonded iron
      cores because the core needs to be less dense then solid iron to
      allow the magnetic flux to extend into the output coil holes and
      not be effectivlly shielded.<br>
      I intend to build a actual torroidal device with 25mm neo cubes
      and an epoxy resin/iron powder core. With 8 ohm input coils to be
      excited with an audio amp with sound frequencies from a tone
      generator on my PC.<br>
      I have some questions, perhaps someone can help.<br>
      1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the input coils to be efficient at
      creating a magnetic field. I want them to be 8 Ohms and operate at
      power levels from a 50 watt RMS audio amp at full volume. What
      thickness and length of wire should I use.<br>
      2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it true that a coil with fewer turns will
      be able to operate at a faster frequency then a coil with more
      turns? / if so why?<br>
      3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where can I get Iron powder in Australia. I
      have purchased Iron Oxide powder for coloring concrete, it is very
      magnetic, am I correct that ferrite cores are made from iron
      oxide?<br>
      4&nbsp;&nbsp; Dose ferrite saturate at 20 000 gauss? / or dose
      saturation relate to mass of material ect.<br>
      Thanks very much in advance, I'm so glad I have found this forum.

      It will not be Over Unity with ferrites.<br>

      Congratulations to Marcel for his excellent and obviously time
      consuming attempt at replication. The key as I see it is having a
      resonant circuit at the input, and keeping its frequency to say,50
      to 100 hertz. higher frequencies would demand a fancy core
      composition. Instead of trying to match the frequency of the
      square wave generator to that of the resonant cicuit, why not
      build an oscillator with a feedback coil wound on the core over
      the input winding. My computor skills are limited so I cant do a
      diagram . Circuit is as follows. Use a 9 volt battery. Use a npn
      transistor eg a BFY51. Connect battery to a pos and neg rail.
      Emitter to neg rail. Connect a potential devider accross pos and
      neg rails,say a10k and a 1k resistor, with the 10k to the pos
      rail. wher the 2 resistors join, connect one end of the feedback
      coil.[2to5 turn] the other end of this coil goes to transistor
      base. connect the input coil of the input transformer [ see US
      patent application number 20060163971] between the transistor
      collector and the pos rail . connect the output side of
      transformer via a cap [10mfd?] to the input coil of the device.
      Use a frequency counter if available to check output frequency at
      device input coil. If its too high, increase value of cap . If it
      wont oscillate, try reversing ends of feedback coil. Well worth
      trying ifyou have come this far. Why can we not have more details,
      Overtone? We cant steel your invention now, and everyone
      incluiding you would benefit by its duplication. <br>

      Hi Marcel,<br>
      user Neptune is right, you must use resonance to couple the most
      power out of it and into it.<br>
      What kind of core are you using ?<br>
      If it is just iron you should stay below 100 Hz because of eddy
      current losses.<br>
      If it is ferrite, it could be, that it just does not work with
      ferrites..<br>
      It probably also depends a lot of the core material !<br>
      Please keep us updated and try to use at the input an LC circuit<br>
      in resonance, so you need less input power.<br>
      The L is the driver coil for your device and the C must be added<br>
      to get the right resonance for a frequency below 100 Hz.<br>

      Just guessing here, but I would think that it would be important
      in this design to not magnetically saturate the core of the ring
      by using too many or too strong of a type of magnet.&nbsp; Perhaps
      weaker ceramic magnets would be useful towards&nbsp; leaving some
      room for a rotating magnetic field to possibly have an
      effect.&nbsp; Limited amount of output power might be an issue
      too, due to core saturation/magnetic strength issues within the
      toroid core?&nbsp; As I recall, wasn't it reported that this
      device worked with gain at low power levels?<br>

      You guys seem to forget that the "open ends" of the magnets will
      "dive directly down" into the core. Which you do not want. So you
      need to close loop them back to a opposit polarity. See the crappy
      drawings I made. Also I think that there is only one imput coil
      needed not one for every magnet. The output coil though needs to
      be many more turns.<br>
      Maybe It's of use to some.<br>

      Hi Nali,<br>
      Yes, I agree with that, the magnetic circuit needs to be closed to
      allow more flux to flow into the core.<br>
      Although if you look at my simulations, even a weak magnet may
      suffice without closing the circuit.<br>
      Another suggestion is to put the holes through where the centre of
      the input coils are.&nbsp; This is where the flux density is at
      its greatest and lowest.<br>
      Or have two holes, one either side of the magnet and use two
      output windings.<br>
      <br>
      Hi Marcel,<br>
      Check the output windings have not shorted out on the sharp
      corners of the core holes.<br>
      You may need to countersink the holes slightly and paint some
      varnish on the metal around the hole to protect the copper wire
      enamel from being damaged.<br>

      Hi there Rob, Nice femm simulations you have. Altough I must point
      out that simulations are so rough that they only act as generals
      idea's of what the flux will do in reality. This has been said
      before. But it's true. Other thing is, when you are drilling the
      holes too near the imput coil's field, and so plan to put the
      output coils there you are in a sence going to power the output
      coils dicectly with the imput coils and have not much more than a
      regular transformer. And so the imput draw will increase
      accordingly with the output load. Coupling between input and
      output must be minimal. Imput coil should only act as a mean to
      push or pull the field of the magnets to a certain direction. And
      so the magnets will do the 'cutting of the coils'<br>
      <br>

      Hi Nali,<br>
      Yes point taken, OK that just leaves putting two holes either side
      of the magnet, to pick up on that "sweet spot".<br>
      The input coils would need to be wound as many layers in a smaller
      area too, as drawn in the simulation.<br>
      <br>
      Hi Marcel,<br>
      One more point, are you doing a push-pull on each pair of coils,
      so at any one time, one coil is energized and one is not?<br>
      I am not sure if it mentions how to pulse the input windings in
      the patent but this would seem the logical way of switching the
      flux.<br>
      You can use a TL494 IC and a couple of mosfets to perform this,
      and if you really want to get a nice clean square pulse use a
      power mosfet driver IC between the TL494 and mosfets like the
      UCC37324:<br>
      UCC37324P<br>

      Hello again. Whilst I respect other peoples opinions, I disagree
      with Kingrs, About filling the holes with iron filings, or using
      iron wire. The patent states that the flux flows around the holes
      like the thread flowing around a bolt. Overtone says this device
      will not be overunity with a ferrite core. This is puzzling
      because the patent is for a GENERATOR. If it is not overunity, it
      becomes an inverter, converter, or transformer. Yet the patent
      actually calls for a ferite core!<br>
      Also, why use a square wave input. If you apply a square wave to a
      tuned or resonant circuit, the net result is a sine wave .
      Sometimes I feel that patents are not worth the paper they are
      written on. The patent has little or nothing to say about input
      /output ratios. If this device has any merit , we are now reduced
      to "wait and see " just like the 10 million other ideas. Sadly,
      wishing doesnt make it so. Sorry, feeling cynical tonight,
      neptune.<br>

      Hi Neptune,<br>
      The iron filings was just an idea to try. I saw on page 2 another
      replication that look promising using a linear example. Good proof
      of concept.<br>
      I think generator windings are an odd thing, the flux does not
      really cut through them as such, its almost as if it has its own
      inverse field that reaches out into core and pulls in electrical
      energy.<br>
      But I stand by my square pulses, I have seen what odd shaped
      traces you get as output without a clean drive into the mosfet.<br>
      You need to start off with square waves and then allow the
      inductor to turn it into a nice curve.<br>
      If you think you can get a sine wave out of a mosfet then be my
      guest.<br>
      Its not efficient,i.e.wasted volts drop across the device to get
      the curve and serves no purpose.<br>

      The core material is highly likely a crystalline type core
      material like metglass suitable for high frequency and high
      permeability. Laminates have a permeability that might be
      suitable, but don't handle high frequencies (above 300hz or so)
      very well. So ferrite is good for the high frequencies but than
      again the permeability is lowww. Metglass takes the bests from
      both. High permeability and (very)high frequency. But you guessed
      it, very expensive. Maybe soma alloy is suitable. But expensive
      also because they probably have to custom make it for you.<br>
      Patents when fully open are actually quite handy. They are a
      worldwide free to get instruction Manuel. Unless they hide
      stuff.... But still patents give us many ideas to work on.<br>
      Power conversion and generation is a curious thing if you think of
      it. Lots of time magnetism does not really 'cut' any wire and
      still it generates of transforms good power. Look at the attached
      picture. Here you see a toroid transformer and a 3phase
      transformer.&nbsp; These are proven devices. And keep in mind that
      the flux will stay 99% inside the core material, never comes out
      to cut the wires of the secondary (?output?) coil. And of course
      the works like 80% efficient. How?&nbsp; The flux never ?comes
      out? of the core material. So there are many devices where the
      flux does not really 'cut' the coils and yet work?<br>

      I posted back last October that the application has been
      superseded. A new patent application will cover factors we
      discovered are necessary for this invention to exceed unity.<br>
      Cores that will work are, as some have suggested, expensive. They
      must have little known characteristics. They must be processed
      using very costly equipment. This invention cannot exceed unity
      otherwise.<br>
      Therefore, sad to say, it is extremely likely that any attempt to
      build the device by individuals is almost certain to fail. (Error
      posted previously in this line is now corrected.)<br>
      To repeat, the first prototype worked and exceeded unity.<br>
      Commercial variations are under development.<br>
      For reasons of international patent law, such as Taiwan and South
      Korea, where publication instantly negates patentability, we will
      not reveal the critical additional information until the second
      patent application is published.<br>

      Hi Marcel,<br>
      Could be the inventors are getting twitchy about people
      replicating their baby?<br>
      I have just done the simulation again in Femm to check my comments
      I made previous to you and it looks like I gave you the wrong info
      or not all the info.<br>
      The coils can indeed be connected in series, but the pulse does
      need to be AC.<br>
      To achieve this requires a "H" bridge of mosfets to allow the coil
      supply to be AC.<br>
      This will give the greatest flux change.<br>
      Saying that though, to simplify things you can do as I suggested
      before and use a push-pull DC pulse applied to the two sets of
      coils to the right and left of each magnet.<br>
      I think what Mark is trying to say is that the balance of current,
      magnet choice and core material are all critical to this working
      at over unity.<br>
      From my simulations, it can be seen that only a very tiny current
      and voltage is required to get the field to switch (20mA @ 0.5V)
      and anything greater will saturate the core.<br>
      Using a magnet too powerful for the core material, will yes,
      saturate the core.<br>
      Also try using ceramic 5 or ceramic 8 magnets to start with.<br>
      I suspect Neo magnets are too powerful for the core material.<br>
      The good thing is that Mark's company will be buying off the shelf
      cores just like you and I.Ã‚Â&nbsp; Metglass make them, we use
      them.<br>

      Hard as it may be for folks here to believe, I hardly ever see
      this forum. We are extremely busy.<br>
      Sorry. No technical information will be released except in patent
      applications.<br>
      If all goes well, we will provide potential licensees with
      pre-manufacturing prototypes later this year.<br>
      We have no control over the time it takes them to gear up for
      production.<br>
      There are also parts required which are not presently mass
      produced as they have no existing market. That factor is also one
      over which we have no control and it may well slow up production,
      although I would think small quantities of self-powered generators
      might be in the market by the end of this year.<br>
      Since development is still much slower than it might be with
      additional funding, all estimates are subject to change. Adequate
      funds might be en-route. If, and when, they arrive we will be able
      to accelerate development.<br>

      If they are indeed real &amp; independently verifiable, MPI's
      claimed developments are exciting.<br>
      But I do wonder if MPI's patent application is valid, since in my
      understanding to get a patent one must disclose sufficient
      information to enable one skilled in the relevant art to practice
      (i.e., make) the invention, but it appears that a lot of skilled
      engineers on this forum have been unable to reproduce the device
      and/or are uncertain how to do so based on the patent.<br>
      A patent is a type of quid pro quo:&nbsp; the inventor discloses
      to the public how to make the invention in return for the
      government's grant to the inventor of a time-limited monopoly on
      the invention.&nbsp; In the U.S., unless the inventor satisfies
      his part of the bargain by meeting numerous statutory (i.e.,
      legal) requirements,&nbsp; the patent won't issue or will be
      revoked on challenge: <br>
      "In order for a patent to be valid, the requirements of 35 USC
      section 112 of written description, enablement, and best mode have
      to be met. . . . The written description requires that the
      inventors show full 'possession' of their inventions by describing
      them in words, structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that
      fully set forth the claimed invention. . . . To satisfy the
      enablement requirement, the description also has to teach how to
      make and use the invention without undue experimentation."&nbsp;
      ((Biotechnology Law Report, October, 2003, p. 473-74.)&nbsp; So,
      if skilled artisans can't create follow the MPI patent to create a
      working MPI device, I wonder if the inventor has satisfied the
      written description and enablement requirments?&nbsp; (That's a
      question for an attorney to answer.)<br>
      In short, the MPI patent application must claim that the device
      does something.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; given the amount of
      apparently unsuccessful experimentation documented by those
      posting in this forum who have apparently tried but failed to
      create the device disclosed in the MPI patent, is the MPI patent
      valid.?&nbsp; As one noted author said, "there's the rub!"<br>

      Hal, all,<br>
      The core is a special type of Metglas. The holes MUST be drilled
      electrically and the core then reprocessed by the manufacturer.<br>
      This first Patent Application on this invention will be followed
      by a second in the future. As shown, even when done correctly, it
      will only go to 99% efficiency. To exceed unity (the first
      prototype had an output more than 100 times the input at an
      extremely low power level &lt; 1 watt) other, not yet disclosed,
      information is necessary.<br>
      Seeking a solution to the complexity of manufacturing this design
      happily led to the breakthrough family of generators that we now
      call GENIE (Generating Electricity by&nbsp; Nondestructive
      Interference of Energy). GENIE is now patent pending. It so far
      appears much easier to manufacture various GENIE designs and
      therefore the design in the published Patent Application is on
      hold.<br>
      Sorry, beyond what appears on our website: magneticpowerinc.com [
      defunct ]no further details or information can be made available,
      except to qualified parties who sign a NonDisclosure Agreement.<br>

      Here is a recent video interview with Graham Gunderson reviewing
      what he will be sharing at the 2015 Energy Science &amp;
      Technology Conference.<br>
      <br>
      He will be presenting on a special transformer he designed that is
      overunity and you’ll get to learn enough of the details to be able
      to replicate it!<br>

      Graham Gunderson is a brilliant, long time researcher and
      developer in the “overunity” field. One of his jobs as a funded
      researcher was to verify free energy claims by many different
      inventors. Graham is listed as the inventor on multiple patented
      inventions and by doing a simple search online, you will find that
      he has possibly researched Floyd Sweet’s Vacuum Triode Amplifier
      (VTA) more than anyone else in this field with the exception of
      maybe John Bedini and only a couple others.<br>

      <br>
      He had a table full of equipment, most of it being testing and
      measuring equipment. The actual core is the miniscule picture
      above. It was not as flashy as Bedini's toys, but his focus was on
      measuring and understanding the concepts at work.<br>
      <br>
      COP of 1.03 if I remember correctly (and it did fluctuate over the
      course of presentation). Not enough to self-run by any means, but
      it was intended to prove the concept<br>
      <br>
      Source is plain sinewave signal fed through an amplifier.<br>
      The top and bottom coils are input, with the center coil being
      output<br>
      Cores are generic ferrites, and there is a small airgap between
      both halves.<br>
      I believe the coils were in attraction but with a 45-90deg phase
      offset.<br>
      At least the source is in resonance to conserve and recycle energy<br>
      <br>
      I am not sure on circuit, but I do know there is a phase delay
      between the two coils. This phase delay causes a magnetic field
      along the center gap that teeter-totters back and forth. The
      pickup coil harvests energy off this flux flipping and everything
      is spit out to carefully calibrated scopes and probes.<br>
      <br>
      It's not fancy and not even a self-runner, but Graham wanted to
      build a Wright Bros aircraft to show the principles of flight
      instead of building a 747 that nobody would understand.<br>
      <br>
      The core part as far as I understand, is that he's using phase to
      rotate flux along the gap under resonance and harnessing power
      from this virtual rotation rather than regular transformer
      induction.<br>

      Couple more bits to add :&nbsp; It was driven by 1 AC amplifier
      plugged into a function gen... Probably tuned capacitance to
      maintain resonance and minimize input.<br>
      <br>
      Quote:<br>
      <br>
      From the presentation was there an indication that the effect is
      frequency dependent or specifically what frequency is being used
      here? kHz, MHz?<br>
      He actually talked more about concepts than the actual device and
      numbers. That said, kHz range, I don't think more than 1mhz.
      Wherever ferrite starts getting lossy, it was definitely below
      that..<br>
      Ballpark, somewhere between 20-200khz.<br>
      I wish I had taken a clip of the FEMM model he showed.. There
      wasn't any magic, or at least anything that didn't conform to
      normal models. It showed a model of the resonant transformer where
      the fields would resonate, and interact so at a certain period
      they would form these fast rotating pinches that would reach far
      off to each side.<br>
      If I'm understanding was correct, his output coil is getting
      energy from this second-order interaction rather than one coil
      simply charging another.<br>
      Quote: Also, did he mention the B-H magnetization curve shape as
      being a factor? Magnetization and hysteresis were mentioned, not
      exactly sure how it fits in his setup. We'll have to ask him.<br>
      I don't think any of us is going to have much luck duplicating
      this exact device (trying to match his hardware and measuring
      equipment). Even if we did, it's only COP 1.03. If we can
      understand these nonlinear one-way interactions, then maybe we'll
      be in the right ballpark.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Chava Energy’s ZPE GENERATOR Fraud</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract.</b><br>
      <br>
      Chava Energy’s ZPE GENERATOR fraud consists of soliciting and
      obtaining investments and grants in a blatantly fraudulent manner,
      making use in particular of the elaborate set of false pretenses,
      false statements, false claims and empty promises to be found in
      Chava Energy’s “Zero Point Energy Generator” fraudcraft, involving
      their so-called “MagGen” concepts.<br>
      <br>
      Chava Energy for five years referred to two devices proposed by
      Graham Gunderson as “MagGen” magnetic generators, falsely and
      fraudulently claiming that they would provide electric power by
      “tapping Zero Point Energy,” and that Chava Energy would create
      “MagGen” prototypes “to provide power for automobiles” “within
      three years.”<br>
      <br>
      To avoid confusion, we will refer to the first “MagGen” as
      Gunderson-20060163971, and the second “MagGen” as
      Gunderson-8093869.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Chava Energy’s First And Second “MagGen” ZPE Generator Fraudcraft<br>
      <br>
      Let’s look at some excerpts from the pack of fraudcraft Chava
      Energy previously posted on their website regarding the “MagGen”
      devices, until its very recent removal:<br>
      <br>
      “Our MagGen™ magnetic generators convert abundant, ambient and
      renewable energy sources that exist everywhere in the universe.
      Power Units can be small and lightweight, and made from non-toxic
      materials.”<br>
      <br>
      “MagGen™: The Chava Magnetic Generator (MagGen™) breakthroughs
      offer several alternate routes to tapping the energy of quantum
      noise (Zero Point Energy) via the magnetic spin moment.”<br>
      <br>
      “Chava has two U.S. Patents patents aimed at commercialization
      under the trademark of MagGen™. Patents #7,830,065 and #8,093,869
      cover solid-state (no moving parts) magnetic generators. An early
      prototype produced an output, at a very low power level, of more
      than 100 times the input.<br>
      <br>
      “The first patent titled ‘Solid State Electric Generator,’ was
      issued Nov 9,2010. The second titled ‘Apparatus for Generating
      Electricity…’ issued January 10,2012. Several prototypes of more
      advanced devices have been built and an additional, very broad,
      patent application has also been filed. All power generation
      modules can be combined, in a manner similar to solar cells, to
      provide larger amounts of power. We expect to file an additional
      thirty (30) patents over the next three (3) years for various
      magnetic power device designs.”<br>
      <br>
      “Chava expects, within three years, of creating prototype Chava
      Energy™ conversion systems to provide power for automobiles.”<br>
      <br>
      “Several prototypes of more advanced devices have been built and
      thirty (30) additional patents are expected to be filed over the
      next thirty-six (36) months for various families of magnetic power
      devices.”<br>
      <br>
      “RESIDENTIAL GENERATORS for off-grid customers will be an early
      market product. Today, generators are typically powered by
      gasoline. In the aftermath of disasters such as hurricanes,
      tornadoes, and typhoons, power is often unavailable; such early
      devices, without requiring fuel, will make a crucial difference.
      Mobile power generators will be a key resource for government
      emergency agencies and rural communities.<br>
      <br>
      “Chava expects, within three years, of creating prototype Chava
      Energy™ conversion systems to provide power for automobiles. This
      eliminates the need for large batteries and for electrical
      recharging stations. That goal may be reached faster if our
      engineering development teams work on a 24/7 basis. The conversion
      systems will open a path to mass production of entirely new
      varieties of automotive power plants. Other industries will follow
      soon after the key markets of residential and automotive power.“<br>
      <br>
      In fact, neither of the two patents referenced above involve
      devices that could ever “tap Zero Point Energy” at all. Neither of
      the patents even mention Zero Point Energy. Neither of the patents
      describe devices that ever serve as useful “energy conversions
      systems” as claimed by Chava. As in every case of pretense by
      Chava, Chava has merely repeated the same empty claims year after
      year, without ever producing or presenting any device or any
      evidence of development.<br>
