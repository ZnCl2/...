        Dr. William Tiller</b>, Professor Emeritus in the Department of
      Material Science and Engineering at Stanford University is the
      author of four ground-breaking books on psychoenergetic science:
      “Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality
      and Consciousness” (1997), “Conscious Acts of Creation: The
      Emergence of a New Physics” (2001), “Some Science Adventures with
      Real Magic” (2005) and “Psychoenergetic Science: A Second
      Copernican-Scale Revolution” (2007); as well as more than 150
      published papers concerning un-actualized human capabilities,
      opportunities and adventures for all of us in the years ahead.
      These works have proven to be eyeopeners for non-scientists and
      scientists, metaphysicians and physicians, students and teachers,
      and all people with a real interest in how science moves our
      world. For the first time, a rigorous experimental protocol is
      available that allows human qualities to meaningfully alter
      properties of physical materials via specific human intentions. A
      pioneer of psychoenergetics since the 1960’s, Dr. Tiller has
      worked in private industry as well as a Professor of Materials
      Science at Stanford University for 30 years. Continuing his
      psychoenergetics research, he currently directs the William A
      Tiller Institute for Psychoenergetic Science in Arizona. In his
      conventional science field he has published over 250 scientific
      papers, 3 books and holds several patents.<b><br>

        </b><b>SEEN AND UNSEEN REALITIES:&nbsp; Discovering the Power of
          Human Intention.</b></b>&nbsp; A specific intention is, first
      and foremost, an act of creation by a human. It is the product of
      a focused mind and may also include flavors of a directed will, a
      nourishing heart, a loving emotion, and an encouraging spirit. The
      quality of an intention relates to the many aspects of a human’s
      consciousness while the power of an intention is strongly
      dependent on the emotional desire of the intender.&nbsp; Since
      1997, carefully designed intention experiments have been studied
      using IHDs (Intention Host Devices) and found to be very
      successful.&nbsp; Recently our group has learned how to use
      specially-designed IHDs to broadcast specific healing intentions
      to humans at locations all around the earth in order to
      significantly alleviate various types of ailments. Our most recent
      on-going work is “The Autism Intention Experiment” This exciting
      approach used with autistic children also appears to be robustly
      successful!<b><br>

      An apparatus and methods for measuring a thermodynamic potential
      of a limited physical space associated with a change in symmetry,
      wherein the limited physical space is characterized by a series of
      symmetry states having a ground symmetry state and at least one
      higher symmetry state. In one embodiment of the present invention,
      the method includes the step of transforming the limited physical
      space from the ground symmetry state to a higher symmetry state to
      cause the thermodynamic potential of the limited physical space to
      change from a first value to a second value. In another
      embodiment, the ground symmetry state is characterized by a U(1)
      EM Gauge symmetry, the thermodynamic potential T is in the form of
      a proton magnetoelectrochemical potential, and the at least one
      higher symmetry state is characterized by an SU(2) symmetry.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention generally relates to apparatus and methods
      of measuring a thermodynamic potential of a limited physical
      space, and in particular to apparatus and methods of registering
      proton magnetoelectrochemical potential departure-of a limited
      physical space due to a change in its symmetry state.<br>
      <br>
      Certain embodiments of the present invention comprise an apparatus
      and methods of changing a thermodynamic potential of a limited
      physical space, wherein the limited physical space is
      characterized by a series of symmetry states having a ground
      symmetry state and at least one higher symmetry state. In one
      embodiment, the limited physical space is transformed from the
      ground symmetry state to a higher symmetry state to cause the
      thermodynamic potential of the limited physical space to change
      from a first value to a second value, which can be detected or
      measured.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Most people including scientists may never give the concept of
      electromagnetic (EM) gauge symmetry much thought, although they
      may know that the macroscopic properties of materials are almost
      completely determined by their electric and magnetic behavior. If
      the topic ever comes up in conversation between colleagues, it is
      generally considered to be in the domain of interest of particle
      physicists or relativity theorists.<br>
      <br>
      However, perhaps they might remember that it may enter the concept
      of the''Big Bang" theory, a cosmological theory that the universe
      began in a state of compression to infinite density and has been
      expanding since some particular instant that marked the origin of
      the universe, in an important way. They might recall that a short
      time after the initiation event, and before to after quarks form
      in the incredibly hot"fireball", the universe evolves to
      successively lower thermodynamic free energy states via step by
      step changes in gauge symmetry, eventually passing through a SU
      (2) gauge symmetry state on its way to a U (1) gauge symmetry
      state, which, as discussed in more detail infra, is often referred
      to as the U (1) EM gauge symmetry state. Thereafter, the free
      energy of the U (1) gauge symmetry state continues to be lowered
      by a set of phase transitions, familiar to people skilled in the
      art, from plasma phase to gas phase then to liquid phase and then
      to solid phase as cooling continues. From the foregoing, one might
      deduce that, if one could raise the EM gauge symmetry state
      associated with an environment such as a laboratory, the
      properties of materials in that environment would change. In fact,
      they should be EM gauge symmetry state specific. The challenge is
      how to change the gauge symmetry state of a limited physical space
      and identify a measurable physical property associated with the
      change.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, among other things, there is a need to develop new and
      improved apparatus and methods of changing the gauge symmetry
      state of a limited physical space, and apparatus and methods of
      measuring same accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one aspect, the present invention relates to an apparatus for
      measuring a thermodynamic potential T of a limited physical space,
      wherein the limited physical space is characterized by a series of
      symmetry states having a ground symmetry state and at least one
      higher symmetry state...<br>
      <br>
      The container can have various types of geometry. For example, in
      one embodiment, the container cross-sectionally is cylindrical.
      The container cross- sectionally can also be circular, square,
      triangular, or the like. Additionally, the liquid can be chosen
      from various types of fluids. For example, in one embodiment, the
      liquid is water. Other types of liquids such as water additional
      with additives may also be utilized to practice the present
      invention. Furthermore, gels and solid state ionic conductors may
      also be utilized to practice the present invention...<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for
      changing a thermodynamic potential of a limited physical space,
      wherein the limited physical space is characterized by a series of
      symmetry states having a ground symmetry state and at least one
      higher symmetry state. In one embodiment, the method has the step
      of transforming the limited physical space from the ground
      symmetry state to a higher symmetry state to cause the
      thermodynamic potential of the limited physical space to change
      from a first value to a second value. The step of transforming
      includes the step of conditioning the limited physical space with
      an information coded radiation that is capable of causing the
      symmetry state of the limited physical space to change. Various
      types of radiation can be utilized to practice the present
      invention. For example, the information coded radiation may
      comprise a magnetic field signal generated from a magnet. Or, the
      information coded radiation may comprise an electric field signal
      generated from an electrical signal generator. The strength of the
      radiation can be adjusted. The radiation can be static or dynamic
      (i. e. , with a time-dependent amplitude)...<br>

      One theory is that only some type of magnetic monopole effect,
      leaking through from the SU (2) gauge symmetry level, may lead to
      such a DC magnetic field polarity effect...<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, among other things, two discoveries were made and
      checked: (1) that a"conditioned"space, a higher EM Gauge symmetry
      space, constituted an important detector of one or more subtle
      energy perturbations in the environment and (2) if a single organ
      or system of the human body was elevated to one of these higher
      symmetry states at birth and the rest of the body was not,
      seemingly all functions of this body could be driven by this
      energy source to exhibit what one call life; i. e. , the heart
      would pump blood, nerve synapses would switch on and off, electric
      currents would flow, the brain would be activated to direct
      various body processes, etc...<br>
      <br>
      To further explore the second discovery, technique from advanced
      kinesiology studies was utilized. There, a practitioner often
      slides a small DC magnet (with a central hole so it is washer-like
      with the N-pole on one face and a S-pole on the other) (not shown)
      onto the tip of his/her finger and, bringing this finger with the
      magnet into the biofield near a particular muscle group of a human
      subject or client, this can either strengthen or weaken the muscle
      group depending upon which pole points towards the muscle group.
      The S-pole facing the muscle group strengthens the muscle while
      the N- pole facing weakens the muscle's response. Since the normal
      U (1) EM Gauge symmetry state would not exhibit such a DC magnetic
      field polarity effect but the higher SU (2) EM Gauge symmetry
      state would, it indicates that the human acupuncture
      meridian/chakra system (which drives muscle response from a deeper
      level) is probably functioning from this SU (2) level while the
      majority of the rest of the physical body functions at the lower U
      (1) EM Gauge symmetry level. This means that EM force in humans,
      and perhaps all vertebrates, is quite different than the standard
      U (1) Gauge EM force.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing disclosure indicates that a thermodynamic driving
      force may exist between the acupuncture meridian/chakra system and
      the coarse physical level of the body. This differential system
      can be labeled as a"chi/prana"pump causing the flow rate of
      such"fluids"through these subtle channels at the fine information
      wave level aspect of the physical body to be sufficient to nourish
      all of the terrain at the coarse particulate level of the physical
      body and thus manifest a satisfactory level of health.<br>
      <br>
      Following this line of reasoning, as shown in Fig. 8, how humans
      operate in life with respect to one another and how
      energy/consciousness emissions can occur when kinesiological
      manipulations of specific acupuncture meridians restore body
      balance by unblocking stagnated channels of chi/prana flow can be
      interpreted in a framework 800.<br>
      <br>
      Framework 800 provides channels for energy and, may be,
      consciousness exchange among elements of a client 803,
      a"conditioning"device 805, a practitioner 807, an "unseen
      universe"809, and a physical space with a gauge symmetry state
      from which other elements operate. Whether one is a practitioner,
      a minister, a healer, a medical doctor or nurse, an acupuncturist,
      a kinesiologist, a performer, a spouse or a parent, Framework 800
      provides an appropriate framework for energy/and consciousness
      exchange.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, among other things, according to the present invention,
      first, material properties are EM Gauge symmetry specific; second,
      that all humans have their own chi/prana pump whereby, via focused
      intention, they may at least metastably raise the local EM Gauge
      symmetry state of their surrounding space; and thirdly, this can
      produce healings of great variety. Moreover, when an obstructed
      infrastructure circuit at some level of the body is restored to
      harmonious balance, a pulse of released energy/consciousness
      manifests and this complex signal may be detected by physical-
      type instruments that have been raised in functionality via being
      part of a laboratory space at a higher EM Gauge symmetry level
      than the normal U (1) symmetry state.<br>
