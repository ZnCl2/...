        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">by <b>Tom Valentine</b></font></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A California inventor has
          found a way to create limitless electric power without using
          up fuel --- potentially the greatest discovery in the history
          of mankind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Edwin Gray Sr., 48, has
          fashioned working devices that could:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Power every auto, train,
          truck, boat and plane that moves in this land --- perpetually.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Warm, cool and service every
          American home --- without erecting a single transmission line.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Feed limitless energy into
          the nation's mighty industrial system --- forever.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And do it all without
          creating a single iota of pollution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Already, the jovial,
          self-educated Gray is forcing scientists to uproot their most
          cherished beliefs about the nature of electromagnetism.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eventually, his discovery
          will transform the economic base upon which the society of the
          entire planet has rested up to this point.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Despite the ever-present
          danger from the petroleum and other power giants who face
          business extinction within the decade because of his
          invention, Gray and his associates in EvGray Enterprises have
          demonstrated its worth publicly --- an act requiring great
          courage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And <i>Tattler</i> is proud
          to report for the first time in America the complete nature of
          gray's astounding system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Displaying the kind of open
          honesty that made America great, Gray and his partners stress
          the fact that they want the whole world to benefit from their
          new technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I won't allow it to be
          bought up and buried by big money interests", Gray told <i>Tattler</i>
          during the exclusive demonstration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I tried for 10 years to get
          American interests to pay some attention, but I've been tossed
          out of more places than most people ever think of going into."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Neither government agencies
          nor private enterprise would listen to Gray, so he turned in
          frustration to foreign interests. The innovative Japanese were
          eager to listen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As soon as word got out
          that the Japanese were interested in what we're doing, the
          Americans started flocking around."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today, the small shop
          facility in Van Nuys is crawling with visitors from every
          segment of US industry and finance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The big money boys from
          Wall Street started coming around", Gray said with a touch of
          defiance in his tone.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A bunch of them came in and
          suggested I file bankruptcy and get rid of all my backers and
          friends. Then they talked about giving me 20 million shares of
          a new corporation at $25 a share."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray was being offered a
          deal worth more than $4 billion --- on paper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That sure sounded rich, but
          I know darn well they would have fixed it up to sell that
          corporation off somewhere for a dollar and leave me holding 20
          million shares of nothing."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The key men at EvGray
          include Richard B. Hackenberger, an electronics engineer who
          formerly worked for Sony and Sylvania corporations and the US
          Navy; and Fritz Lens, a former Volkswagen mechanic who knows
          nearly as much about the fantastic electrical system as Gray.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the corporate officers
          agreed that they are determined to get around the money
          roadblocks and bestow the discovery upon the world.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tattler was given a thorough
          demonstration of Gray's "impossible-but-true" methods for
          using electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first demonstration
          proved that Gray uses a totally different form of electrical
          current --- a powerful, but "cold" form of the energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A 6-volt car battery rested
          on a table. Lead wires ran from the battery to a series of
          capacitors which are the key to Gray's discovery. The complete
          system was wired to two electromagnets, each weighing a pound
          and a quarter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Now, if you tried to charge
          those two magnets with juice form that battery and make them
          do what I'm going to make them do, you would drain the battery
          in 30 minutes and the magnets would get extremely hot", Gray
          explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I want you to watch what
          happens."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As Lens activated the
          battery, a voltmeter gradually rose to 3,000 volts, At that
          point, Gray closed a switch and there was a loud popping
          sound. The top magnet hurled into the air with tremendous
          force and was caught by Hackenberger. A terrific jolt of
          electricity had propelled the top magnet more than two feet
          into the air --- but the magnet remained cold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The amazing thing",
          Hackenberger said, "is that only 1% of the energy was used ---
          99% went back into the battery."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray explained, "The battery
          can last for a long time, because most of the energy returns
          to it. The secret to this is in the capacitors and in being
          able to split the positive."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Gray said "split the
          positive", the faces of two knowledgeable physicists screwed
          up in bewilderment. Normally, electricity consists of positive
          and negative particles. But Gray's system is capable of using
          one or the other separately and effectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"He means we have to rewrite
          the physics textbooks", Hackenberger grinned. It has been the
          engineer's job in recent months to formulate gray's system and
          put it into writing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That's not an easy job
          because this system actually defies everything I've ever
          learned."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray said, "I never had no
          schooling in electronics or physics, so nobody told me it was
          impossible."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "impossible" part of the
          demonstration was the lack of heat generated in the magnet.
          Heat is one of the biggest problems faced by electrical
          technology. Also "impossible" is the fact that only the
          "positive" nature of the energy was used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This thing is in its
          infancy", Gray explained. "When the full potential of American
          technology starts working with it, the results will astound
          everyone."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further proof that he has
          an unusual source of power with unlimited potential was
          demonstrated next.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We've been popping those
          magnets apart for the past 18 months with the same battery and
          it's still got a full charge. Now I want you to watch this…"</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray showed this <i>Tattler</i>
          reporter a small 15-amp motorcycle battery. It was hooked up
          to a pair of his capacitors which in turn were hooked up to a
          panel of outlets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He flicked a switch and the
          tiny battery sent a charge into the capacitors. He then
          plugged in six 15-watt electric bulbs on individual cords ---
          and a 110-volt portable television set and two radios. The
          bulbs burned brightly, the television played, and both radios
          blared --- and yet, the small battery was not discharging.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You couldn't get all this
          current out of that battery under ordinary circumstances",
          Gray said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is the most amazing
          thing I've ever seen!" exclaimed C.V. Wood Jr, president of
          the McCulloch Oil Corporation, who was also present at the
          demonstration. He began looking for hidden outlets from the
          wall.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"May I prove it doesn't come
          from any wall plug?" Gray offered.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A 40-watt light bulb screwed
          into an ordinary extension socket was plugged into the panel
          powered by gray's system. The bulb lit, then Gray dropped it
          into a cylinder filled with water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"What would be happening if
          this was getting ordinary power right now?" Gray asked, as he
          stuck his hand in the water with the glowing light bulb.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You'd be electrocuted and
          that thing would be popping and sputtering until the fuses
          blew", Wood replied.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This reporter then put his
          finger into the water with the light --- no shock.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Gentlemen, this is a new
          manifestation of electricity", Hackenberger said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The engineer told the
          astounded onlookers that no laws of physics were being
          violated, but a new application of electricity has been
          discovered and put to work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray, one of 14 children,
          comes from Washington DC. As a small boy, he was fascinated by
          electricity, magnets, and gadgets in general.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I really got excited about
          electricity when they tested the first radar across the
          Potomac in 1936. I was 11 years old then and visions of buck
          Rogers danced in my head."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He learned about radar
          during his World War II hitch in the Navy and "I've been
          messing around with coils and capacitors ever since".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He learned to "split the
          positive" in 1958 and spent the next dozen years finding the
          funds to put his discovery to work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any abbreviated explanation
          of Gray's system is an over-simplification of the technical
          aspects of this tremendous breakthrough, but some of the best
          minds in the US are now working with Gray to further improve
          his discovery.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray held the 40-watt bulb
          up out of the water and said: " You know, to light this bulb
          takes millions of dollars in power plant facilities,
          transmission lines, and circuitry. With my capacitors, I can
          provide power to any home for a couple hundred dollars."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The economic impact of that
          statement is beyond the imagination --- not to mention the
          ecology and anti-pollution benefits.</font> </p>

          being called "that car of the future" for Americans today.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We have the answer to the
          energy crisis", declared Edwin Gray, the Van Nuys, CA inventor
          who revolutionized the use of electricity by producing an
          electromagnetic motor using an ordinary auto battery that does
          not wear down in a few short miles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Our system can eventually
          solve the world's fuel and pollution problems", Gray told <i>Tattler</i>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Paul M. Lewis, inventor of
          the "Fascination", an ultra-modern, "three-point road
          contact", all-plastic auto. His car of the future lists a
          number of engineering advantages over today's models, and the
          EMA motor will slowly replace internal combustion engines</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although it looks like a
          "three-wheeled" car, the Fascination actually has four wheels.
          The two front wheels are set close together. It is similar to
          the front wheels of an aircraft. Thus the name for Lewis'
          corporation --- Highway Aircraft Corp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The 77-year-old inventor
          told Tattler, "Mr. Gray has promised delivery of his EMA motor
          by March of 1974 and we'll get our car on the road shortly
          afterwards."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lewis, a veteran of many
          hassles with the auto-oil monopoly, was finally forcing his
          way to the marketplace with an all-new auto design when he
          heard about the EMA motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We had an advantage over
          standard cars even with our Renault engine. But, with this
          motor, the big boys don't have a chance unless they get up to
          date," the fiery inventor told Tattler. "I've battled the
          industry tooth and nail for years now, and now we're coming on
          strong."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1936, Lewis designed a
          three-wheeled car that looked a lot like the present
          Volkswagen bug. He called it the "Airmobile", and his original
          model is still on display at Harrah's auto Museum in Reno, NV.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Though he hid not know what
          Dr. Ferdinand Porsche was doing in Germany, the Lewis
          Airmobile was amazingly similar to the popular VW beetle.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both vehicles were low cost,
          simplistic in design, used horizontal opposed four-cylinder
          air-cooled engines, transaxles, independent suspension systems
          and unitized body construction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When World War II came
          along, it sent VW soaring in Germany, but killed the
          Airmobile. Porsche fit into the German establishment, but
          Lewis was a "crackpot" inventor and a pain in the neck to the
          economic status quo.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The VW beetle's popularity
          proves that Lewis' original idea was valid and worthy, despite
          the laughter from Detroit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Airmobile was driven out
          of business in the late 1930s by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission and the U.S. Postal Department, who have been
          called bureaucratic flunkies for the oil-auto monopoly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I was harassed for two
          years and they refused to let me sell stock in my company on
          the pretense they were investigating possible wrongdoing",
          Lewis said. "After I was beaten down, they sent
          representatives to tell me they found nothing wrong and I
          could sell stock. A man can't make a dead horse walk."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After losing the Airmobile,
          despite driving it through 26 states for more than 45,000
          miles without a repair, Lewis went from Denver to Los Angeles,
          where he continued inventing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His inventions made him
          financially solvent and he charged back into the auto
          business.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He planned to use his own
          "boilerless" steam engine in Fascination until the EMA motor
          came along.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A model of Ed Gray's motor
          is on display at Lewis' Highway Aircraft Corp., headquarters
          in Sidney, NE.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We will eventually have
          stock to sell, but at this time we simply want the public to
          keep abreast of our progress", Lewis told Tattler.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although still in the embryo
          stage, the merger of the two inventions promises to keep
          America in the technological forefront of the world.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first prototype car cost
          Lewis more than $200,000 to build and the first prototype EMA
          motor ran close to $1 million to build.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We will eventually tool up
          for mass production and bring the costs down considerably",
          Lewis said. "But the first 100,000 or so fascination cars with
          the EMA motor will cost the public about $2 per pound. Today's
          cars cost about $1 per pound, but we're almost twice as
          light."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The buying public will pay
          an estimated $5,000 for the Fascination with the EMA motor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although the Fascination
          will be priced with moderate cars and more expensive than
          economy cars, the savings on fuel and repair costs quadruple
          its value.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The body of Fascination will
          be made of Royalex, a tough rubber-like Uniroyal product.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To insure that his radical
          design will be practical and not only meet but surpass all
          safety standards, Lewis has contracted with two of the best
          automobile engineers in the world.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Visioneering, Inc. (Fraser,
          MI) is concentrating on the Fascination in order to insure it
          does everything Lewis claimed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Richard Hackenberger, the
          electronics engineering expert hired by Gray to put his motor
          to work on a practical basis, explained how the new car will
          operate:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Because we are not taking
          current directly from the batteries, but rather are
          supplementing the static charge which operates the system, we
          are getting fantastic efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Of course, further research
          and development will eventually allow a motorist to drive
          across the nation without recharging his batteries, but we
          estimate a family could drive 500 miles at highway speeds
          without recharging."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hackenberger said the
          500-mile estimate is a "conservative" one and is applicable to
          a car using air-conditioning or heating and radio.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Just driving around town,
          the EMA will last a lot longer without recharging", he said.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The engine will run in any
          temperature and there is no noise, no cooling system, and no
          exhaust fumes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The battery will go to work
          when the key is turned on and the light on the dash will glow
          while the starter motor builds the rotor up to speed. The
          light is used instead of a tachometer and it will only take a
          few seconds for the motor to build up and be ready to go."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hackenberger was quick to
          explain, "We do not have perpetual motion here. We have an
          electrostatic generating system and a capacitor bank doing
          some very efficient work. The principle is based on a
          modification of Ohm's Law."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The power for the motor is
          generated by magnetic repulsion. Engineers have tested the
          motor and it develops 100 horsepower at the brake.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This means we are as
          powerful as any standard internal combustion car on the road
          today. The inefficiency of the internal combustion engine is
          the reason", he said.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The man who first told the
          world through a <i>Tattler</i> article that he had invented a
          no-fuel engine capable of providing electricity at half
          today's cost has received more than $6 million to develop his
          machine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We're finally out of the
          woods", inventor Edwin Gray, president of EvGray Enterprises
          (Van Nuys, CA), told Tattler.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We've been struggling
          against the big business monopoly (against the marketing of
          new types of power plants) for years in this country, but
          finally made it --- and we did it without going to
          foreigners."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's revolutionary ideas
          in power production were first made public in this periodical
          last summer. The inventor has received additional funds to
          develop an automobile motor for an all-new plastic car to be
          called "Fascination".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He plans to build a battery
          substation to supply 100 megawatts of electricity at peak
          periods while expending only 40 kilowatts doing so, using
          cobalt batteries and electromagnetic association motors, which
          he developed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This goal has been disputed
          by many "experts", who claim Gray and his company may be
          perpetrating some kind of hoax.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's electromagnetic
          association (EMA) motor is not perpetual motion or any
          mystery, he stressed, but rather a unique blending of three
          known forces to make energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Using static electricity
          isn't new, neither is recycling power or activating
          electromagnets, but Ed Gray simply became the first to put all
          three together with the right combination", Richard
          Hackenberger, his aide, told <i>Tattler</i>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whether it's driving a car
          or generating power, the EMA system works the same.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The motor draws small
          amounts of direct current from a battery and blends it with
          static electricity to make the static "work".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The static charge then
          activates the electromagnets, the engineer explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tests conducted this past
          September by Crosby Research Institute (Beverly Hills, CA)
          showed the original EMA prototype motor had a "measured
          overall system efficiency exceeding 99%".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Crosby Engineering director
          J. A. Maize conducted the intensive testing on behalf of Pan
          World Enterprises Company, Ltd., a Japanese conglomerate.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Maize operated the motor
          into a 10-horsepower dynamometer load at 1,100 rpm, a power
          output of 7,460 watts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the batteries used in
          the test were only capable of 5,454 watts per hour. Therefore,
          the motor was making its own electricity while it worked ---
          and using absolutely no fuel in the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The system will operate
          continuously for 203 hours at 10 horsepower and 1,100 rpm
          without recharge since the total battery power consumed is
          only 26.8 watts per hour", Maize said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Recycling of the batteries
          during non-operational periods would permit continuous system
          operation until the end of battery life."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since those tests, however,
          the EvGray people have further improved their system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Funds to develop the
          generating plant have been provided by a trio of wealthy US
          geologists who made fortunes in oil exploration, but now feel
          a new source of energy is mandatory for the world, Gray told <i>Tattler</i>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The men who financed this
          project don't want their names released to the public", he
          said. "They're seeking electricity, not publicity."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Gray and "Fascination"
          car designer Paul Lewis announced plans to have the fuelless
          car on the road by the end of 1974, he already had improved
          the motor to the point where he could drive the car at normal
          speeds for more than 500 miles between rechargings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But since we are
          estimating, we are being ultra-conservative", Hackenberger
          insisted. "We now plan to have a prototype car on the test
          track by the end of summer."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Original plans called for
          the car to be in prototype earlier, "but lawyers, not our
          system, held us up", Gray added.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray now is beginning
          negotiations with foreign groups after refusing the temptation
          for years while waiting for some developments in the US.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Italian government is
          very interested", Gray told <i>Tattler</i>. "We were told by
          one representative that they wanted to develop this source of
          power quickly because they never want to look at another Arab
          as long as they live."</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Los Angeles (AP) ~ Edwin
          Gray, a self-educated inventor, says he has designed a car
          motor that needs no fuel. Hundreds of investors have put their
          money on it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But local authorities have
          charged him with bilking his believers out of thousands of
          dollars. A specialist in energy engineering saw the prototype
          motor and said if it worked, "it would violate all the laws of
          physics"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the eyes of Gray's
          supporters, it is a case of a small-time inventor being
          harassed because he is on the trail of a revolutionary idea
          that challenges the auto establishment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If allowed to develop his
          invention, Gray said, "This motor will probably replace most
          motor power in the very near future."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Claims for the device have
          varied over the past four years, according to the Los Angeles
          County district attorney's office, but essentially it has been
          described as an electromagnetic motor" that is started by a
          set of batteries, then runs virtually on its own and puts
          energy back into the batteries --- enough so that they need
          charging only infrequently.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If it did what he says it
          would violate all the laws of physics", said Donald Cronin, a
          staff scientist at TRW Systems, Inc., who watched a test of
          the motor about a year ago.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It ran for about 10 seconds
          and then everything blew", he said. "A group of scientists
          from a big research firm in Japan had come with an elaborate
          amount of equipment --- gauges, instruments, and TV cameras
          --- and were ready to sign a letter of intent. After the test,
          they packed it all up and went back to Japan."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray, 50, says he has been
          toying with the idea for such an engine since he was 7 years
          old. He is almost boastful about his lack of scientific
          training.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The technical people tell
          me that if I had a technical background I wouldn't have come
          up with a motor like this", he says.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray began selling shares in
          his invention in 1971 and attracted some 800 shareholders.
          Last July investigators from the district attorney's office
          seized the prototype engine, plans, drawings and bookkeeping
          records. It was not until May that charges were filed against
          gray --- one count of conspiracy to commit grand theft, eight
          counts of grand theft, and three counts of a securities
          violation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's attorneys' cite the
          10-month delay as one sign of harassment. A national tabloid
          newspaper attacked the D.A.'s office for its
          "behind-the-scenes suppression of one man's effort to help
          mankind".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This kind of talk frustrates
          the investigators, who see themselves as acting to protect lay
          investors who aren't able to distinguish a technically
          complicated fraud from a valid research effort.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Edwin Gray must be
          persuasive, though: two investigators from the D.A.'s office
          "went down to see and got hustled themselves --- they invested
          money of their own for a while, but later got it back", said
          Deputy D.A. Mitchell Harris.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As to why the case has taken
          so long to prosecute, authorities say that, in the first
          place, it has been hard to find investors willing to press
          charges.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The D.A.'s office also
          points out that the investigators were busy with other cases
          they considered more pressing, and this kept them form
          wrapping up the gray investigation.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the time, <i>Tattler</i>
          predicted the Gray engine would revolutionize the auto
          industry. We also published Gray's announcement to have
          automobiles containing the engine in production an available
          to the public by the end of 1974. That obviously has not
          happened yet, and for a very good reason.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the past seven months,
          Gray has been the victim of an incredible campaign of obvious
          harassment by the Los Angeles District Attorney's office. This
          harassment appears to be yet another chapter in a long history
          of attempts to suppress any automobile invention that might
          disrupt the status quo for auto manufacturing as established
          by Detroit's car-making giants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Tattler</i> was warned
          not to print this story until the issue was settled in court.
          We are printing it because the public has a right to know what
          is happening and because it has become obvious that the
          district attorney has no intention of seeking a quick decision
          in the case. In this exclusive report, Articles Editor Tom

              Arrest Spurs Tattler Reporter"</font></font></b></center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At one point during his
          investigation of the Ed Gray EMS motor case, <i>Tattler</i>
          Articles Editor Tom Valentine was threatened with arrest if he
          pursued the matter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The threat came from Ran
          Novell, an investigator with the Los Angeles District
          Attorney's office.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Valentine telephoned
          the district attorney's office to inquire why the DA had kept
          the gray case pending five months without bringing formal
          charges, Novell snapped back:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I'm advising you of your
          rights. You have the right to remain silent because anything
          you say may be used against you in a court of law."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I don't have anything to
          say. I'm simply trying to ask questions", replied Valentine.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well, you might be indicted
          as a co-conspirator in this case", said Novell.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You've got to be kidding",
          said Valentine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later, Valentine expressed
          his opinion that the threat was nothing more than an attempt
          to"scare me away from the case".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But if that was what he was
          trying to do he couldn't have picked a worse tactic. All he
          succeeded in doing was making me resolve to get to the bottom
          of this", said Valentine.</font> </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The effort of Ed Gray to
          produce a fuelless automobile engine that could greatly
          benefit mankind has been blocked by the Los Angeles District
          Attorney's Office.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray is the inventor of the
          EMS motor --- a remarkable electromagnetic engine that
          regenerates its own power, thus eliminating the need for
          liquid fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray had intended to have
          his motor in production and available to the general public by
          the end of 1974. However, a series of confrontations with the
          L.A. District Attorney's office has completely stymied his
          efforts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's problems began last
          July 22, when L.A. authorities raided his plant in Van Nuys,
          CA. Virtually everything in the building was confiscated ---
          including his working prototype motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Seven months later, not a
          single charge has been brought against Gray. Yet, the
          L.A.&nbsp; District Attorney's office still has his records
          and engine models.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Van Nuys raid is only
          the latest incident in a strange pattern of "non-arrests" of
          automotive inventors that dates back more than half a century.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a continuing
          investigation of this phenomenon, <i>Tattler</i> has
          documented dozens of cases in which inventors came up with "a
          better idea" for an automobile engine, only to be harassed
          into tragic situations ranging from bankruptcy to suicide.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One example was the
          invention of the Lewis automobile more than 40 years ago.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1933, Paul Lewis invented
          a three-wheeled car powered by an air-cooled engine. Called
          the "Airmobile", Lewis' product proved itself in road tests.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But when he began selling
          stock in his company in order to obtain capital to
          mass-produce the vehicle, the Securities and Exchange
          Commission stopped him.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For years the SEC kept Lewis
          "under investigation" without bringing any formal charges.
          Finally, he was harassed into bankruptcy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Once I was bankrupt the SEC
          dropped its investigation and told me I was clear to
          continue", Lewis recalled during a recent interview with <i>Tattler</i>.
          "All I could do was swear at them and ask them if they knew
          any way I could make a dead horse walk."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today Lewis' "Airmobile" can
          be seen in a museum at Harrah's Club in Reno, NV.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ironically, his "better
          idea" was not totally suppressed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Germany during the 1930s
          away from the influence of Detroit's auto giants, an
          automobile was developed using the air-cooled engine principal
          first advanced by Lewis. Today, that car is called the
          Volkswagen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yet another example of such
          suppression is found in the history of the John Robert Fish
          carburetors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fish invented a carburetor
          that double the gas mileage of Detroit's standard carburetors.
          When Detroit snubbed his invention, Fish tried selling his
          invention through the mails to do-it-yourself mechanics. He
          was growing successful when Post Office Department agents
          swooped down on him for "investigation of fraud".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Several years later he was
          exonerated of any charges. But not until the mails to and from
          his business were stopped during a lengthy "investigation". He
          was wiped out financially.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A modern case is that of the
          LaForce brothers, presently locked in a controversy with the
          Environmental Protection Agency, which yet another branch of
          our huge federal bureaucracy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The LaForce brothers are
          outstanding mechanics and automotive engineers from Vermont
          who have designed and built an improved auto engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The LaForce engine was
          tested by the EPA last fall and government spokesmen announced
          they were impressed. It looked like a small time inventor had
          finally broken through the bureaucratic curtain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hardly a week passed after
          the impressive EPA tests when it was announced that the
          LaForce engine, though more efficient regarding mileage, was
          more polluting.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ed LaForce told <i>Tattler</i>:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That's a crock of you know
          what! I don't know what their motive is, but we conducted very
          thorough tests before going to the EPA."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The LaForce brothers are not
          barnyard operators; they own and operate extremely
          sophisticated equipment and they know what their engine can
          do.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Like Ed Gray's case, the
          LaForce controversy is just beginning.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On July 1, 1973, <i>Tattler</i>
          exclusively reported Ed Gray's discovery. Using electricity,
          he had found a way to drive a car without fuel, without
          pollution, and without noise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The motor can be used to
          generate enough power to drive a car while recharging its own
          batteries --- providing practically perpetual power with
          super-efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On January 27, 1974, <i>Tattler</i>
          followed up with the story of how Gray and Paul Lewis were
          planning to put the EMS motor in the "Fascination" auto body
          designed by Lewis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At that time, Gray said his
          system would need two banks of batteries and recharging would
          be accomplished simply because batteries could not take the
          charge rapidly enough.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lewis and Gray could not get
          together financially and their plans changed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's attorney, Joel Ward,
          filled Tattler in on the details since the July 22 raid.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Despite the action by the
          D.A.'s office, I am unaware of any of the 800 stockholders in
          EvGray Enterprises demanding their money back.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I am aware that some of the
          stockholders have offered more money, which is certainly
          indicative of their confidence in gray's inventions."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward said that the company
          is in the process of thoroughly testing and evaluating a new
          prototype EMS motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is apparent that the
          academic scientists have taken issue with Ed Gray's layman's
          language", Ward said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Here's an inventor with
          only a high school education telling scientists that he can do
          something totally new to them, and saying so in language they
          cannot accept.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are in the process of
          fully explaining the new concepts in scientific terms", Ward
          added.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The attorney stressed that
          the US Patent office has notified him that every claim for the
          Gray motor has been accepted and the patent will therefore be
          issued.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This means they accept the
          novelty of his motor. Now we are testing the prototype to
          determine what it's optimum capabilities are."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward said that separate
          patents will be filed on Gray's innovative energy process.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward said the company has
          not wanted additional trouble, and therefore they have
          maintained a low key approach to the D.A.'s actions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward added: "I'm not going
          to discuss what we night do at this time. From a legal
          standpoint it might not be wise."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many people close to the
          controversy have wondered aloud why Gray doesn't sue the D.A.
          for the apparent harassment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward refused to comment on a
          possible suit, but Tattler learned that no suit can be field
          until the case is closed. As things stand it is an "ongoing"
          investigation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The investigator in charge,
          Ran Novell, told <i>Tattler</i> that, "We're going to charge
          Gray with grand theft for taking money under fraudulent
          pretenses. His motor doesn't do what he claims. All he has is
          a starter motor run by some batteries". However, Novell also
          admitted that no one in the D.A.'s office had tested the motor
          --- or even started it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since <i>Tattler</i> has
          been diligent in checking Gray's claims before publishing the
          first story, such a charge came as a surprise. A number of
          scientists pronounced the engine sound and workable before the
          initial story was printed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Novell said that the
          original search warrant was based on a complaint by a former,
          and apparently disgruntled, employee.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The D.A.'s investigator, who
          is not an attorney, said there were also earlier complaints
          about stock sales.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As of this writing the
          charges are still "pending" and nothing has been resolved.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Normally, in cases of
          invention fraud, stockholders clamor for their money back and
          the inventor declares bankruptcy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I know a lot of people want
          us to get going and bring this invention out right now", Gray
          told <i>Tattler</i>, "and we're doing everything we can."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Novell told <i>Tattler</i>:
          "Look, if this thing had any possibility I'd be the first to
          promote it."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Tattler</i> learned that
          Novell's sincerity may be questionable. The investigator had
          every opportunity to get all the facts in advance of the raid.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I wrote the D.A.'s office
          last April when I first heard of the investigation and stated
          our willingness to cooperate", Ward said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"My letter was ignored and
          they raided the facility. Then, and this is unheard of, after
          the raid I mad another offer to cooperate, which was also
          ignored."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ward said that he submitted
          written expert opinion to Novell's office in the belief that
          Novell would exchange expert opinions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"They have our expert's
          opinion in writing, but I'm still waiting for theirs", Ward
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tattler has learned from a
          source within the D.A.'s office that it is general knowledge
          that Novell is "persecuting" rather than "prosecuting" the
          case.</font> </p>

          aren't they? Not only are we taking more out of the earth than
          the earth has to give, but we're also using what we take to
          ruin the air above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sitting in a small
          laboratory in Van Nuys, California, is a curious creation
          which, based on the merits of dynamometer tests and other
          rigid trials, claims to be the solution. It's called the EMA
          (Electro-Magnetic Association) motor and, in technical jargon,
          is described as "digital-pulsed, "time-phased", and
          "servo-controlled". Developed by EvGray Enterprises, an
          independent research and development firm, the unique engine
          runs on the principle of electromagnetic transformation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In terms more meaningful to
          the layman, the EMA motor requires no fossil fuel, recycles
          its own energy, creates no waste, and is extremely quiet. Its
          size, weight and horsepower ratios are comparable to motors
          and turbines now in use.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The EMA's only external
          power source consists of four 6-volt batteries which never
          need recharging and which have the same life expectancy as the
          standard automobile battery. EvGray claims the motor
          duplicates the power and torque characteristics of internal
          combustion engines of similar size and weight, and the Federal
          and State Air Resources Board has granted the inventors a
          permit to further prove this claim by installing the EMA in
          test vehicles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Edwin Gray, Sr, president of
          EvGray, predicts production costs of the EMA will be
          comparable to present motors and maintenance costs will be far
          less, "The EMA motor promises to make the world a cleaner
          place in which to live", says Gray, who has spent 12 years
          developing the engine. "Perfection of the EMA motor as a
          generating source could means the availability of inexpensive
          power to underdeveloped nations."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">EvGray expects the EMA motor
          --- when tailored for specific applications --- to become a
          desired replacement for virtually all power systems now in
          use…</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lightning &amp; "Energy
            Spikes" ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray describes the operation
          of his EMA motor as "similar to recreating lightning". He says
          the engineering and scientific world has known this recreation
          is possible but hasn't known how to do it. "When lightning
          hits the ground, causing a 10-million volt buildup, where does
          the energy come from to make it from a static charge to a
          lethal charge? Nobody really knows."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Richard B. Hackenberger,
          Sr., vice-president in engineering for EvGray, explains how
          the EMA system operates" "Power from the high-voltage section
          is put through a system of electrical circuitry to produce a
          series of high-voltage 'energy spikes'. The spikes are
          transferred to a small control unit, which in turn operates
          the major motor unit. The control unit, acting in a manner
          similar to that of a distributor in an internal combustion
          engine, regulates the spikes, determines their polarity
          (whether they be north or south) and directs their power to
          selected electromagnets in the main unit. While this occurs,
          the recycle/regeneration system is recharging the batteries
          with 60 to 120-amp pulses. The electromagnets are located on
          both the rotor and stator of the large motor. Attraction and
          repulsion between the two sets of magnets causes the motor to
          operate and generate horsepower. Once in motion, the motor
          recharges the batteries as a result of the
          recycle/regeneration system. To prevent condensation in the
          main cylinder, a half-pound of air pressure has to be
          maintained. Air is routed through the programmer for
          functional purposes. When the ambient temperature is 90
          degrees, the motor operates at 170 degrees."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In short, the principle of
          the engine is to create electricity and recycle energy by the
          factor that every time magnets are energized off the peak of
          transients, a charge goes back into the battery. It's not a
          constant charge, but a pulse charge of 60 amps or better;
          thus, the battery must be of high quality. The batteries for
          the EMA motor are furnished by McCulloch Electronic
          Corporation of Los Angeles. After extensive research and
          testing, EvGray chose the model 110-75 Energy Center, which is
          said to produce maximum power for its weight and volume over
          an exceptionally long life span. This is achieved partly by
          use of an ultra-lightweight plastic case that minimizes dead
          weight (energy-storing components comprise more than 90% of
          the battery's weight). Features of the battery include
          extra-large plates separated by indestructible glass-rubber
          separators and a specially formulated lead oxide composition.
          Two of the 6-volt batteries are used for operation, while the
          other two serve as a reservoir. Mallory Electric Corporation
          of Carson City, NV, has also made a major contribution toward
          the design of the electronic pulsing system.</font> </p>

            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electric-powered vehicles
          are not new, of course, but the poor energy-storage factor of
          batteries and their heavy, large size have thus far made them
          impractical for use in any vehicles requiring a long-range
          capacity. This drawback has restricted the market for electric
          power to small limited-performance vehicles. The maximum range
          of these vehicles when driven at 40 mph has been approximately
          150 miles. Range is affected by the number of starts and
          stops, grades traversed, and acceleration demands.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The EMA motor needs only to
          run at 500 rpm for the normal recharging system to work. In
          fact, its recharging capabilities are such that the EvGray's
          next version of the engine won't have an alternator or air
          pump. The air pump will be replaced by blades on the rotor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The idea of a
          self-sustaining electric motor", says Gray, "at first appears
          to go against much of the theory of electricity and
          conservation of energy. The EMA motor does not, however,
          violate the basic laws of physics, but rather utilizes them in
          a unique integration in a system in order to maximize upon the
          characteristics and interrelationships between electrical,
          magnetic, and physical components. The EMA prototype motor has
          had considerable operating test time and has been adapted to
          standard and automatic automobile transmissions."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dynamometer tests have
          recorded the rpm's of EvGray's motor at 2550 constant, the
          torque at 66 pounds constant. Brake horsepower is 32.5. After
          a test run of 21-1/2 minutes, the battery voltage was 25.7.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Only three surfaces male
          physical contact with the motor, a feature which dramatically
          limits friction and increases efficiency. "An internal
          combustion engine is only 30% efficient", says Gray. "Our
          engine is 90% efficient". A Prime factor in friction control
          is the so-called "magnetic vacuum" created in the drum, which
          literally takes the pressure off end bearings and allows the
          rotor to float within the drum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Our motor creates power
          surges --- one behind the other --- in microseconds", says
          Gray. "By doing this, we are able to direct the magnetic flux
          field. The magnetic flux is a&nbsp; coolant source, so we need
          no cooling system."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray says the engine is not
          affected by rain, heat, cold, any other type of inclement
          weather, or by driving through tunnels: "All this motor needs
          is oxygen. The external magnetic effect is that another field
          system cannot operate within this same battery system. The
          magnetic field orientation is 360 degrees in all directions."</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Light, Easy to Make ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new EMA prototype will
          weigh about 320 pounds, less than most present internal
          combustion engines. It will measure 12 inches in diameter, 18
          inches in length (Size is linear to horsepower required).
          According to Gray, further research should make it possible to
          reduce the size and weight through the use of lighter metals
          and more sophisticated circuitry.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray says most of the
          motor's components can be built in a machine shop with a mill
          and lathe. The exceptions are the drum itself, the
          electromagnets, and a few miscellaneous items bought over the
          counter in an auto supply store. The company plans to enter
          into worldwide licensing agreements to manufacture the motor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The safety features of the
          EMA are impressive. There's no fan, no exposed high-voltage
          component parts, no exhaust fumes, no fuel tanks to explode,
          no water reservoirs to clog up, freeze or overheat. EvGray
          believes the reliability of the engine will be excellent, and
          maintenance should be minimal because there's no carbon,
          water, varnish or other impurities --- which occur normally as
          a result of burning oil or gasoline --- to damage parts. There
          is no carburetor to clean and adjust, no oil filter to change,
          no gas filter, smog valve, gaskets, radiator, water pump or
          timing chain. Plug-in type construction makes replacing parts
          quick and easy. Gray says the training time for EMA mechanics
          is less than that for mechanics working with a standard
          electric motor and far less than those preparing to work on
          internal combustion engines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The EMA also favors the
          eardrums of mankind. Its noise emission is far less than that
          of all other power sources, and Gray claims that there will be
          no increase in noise as the engine ages. In fact, electric
          motor noise is almost imperceptible when properly suppressed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the reason Edwin
          Gray, now 48, has been able to create such an unconventional
          engine is his unconventional education. One of 14 children, he
          began tinkering with magnets and electricity as a boy. He left
          home when he was 15 and served a year in the US Army before it
          was discovered he was underage and he was given an honorable
          discharge. During that year he attended an Army school for
          advanced engineering. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he
          reenlisted, this time entering the Navy. After serving three
          years of combat duty in the pacific zone, he returned to
          civilian life and found work in the field of mechanics.
          Resuming his experiments with electromagnetic power, he
          seriously examined the theory of "energy used is energy
          spent".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After years of research and
          experimentation, gray conducted his first test of the EMA
          motor in 1961. The engine ran briefly and then broke down.
          Discouraged but not defeated, he constructed a second
          electromagnetic motor, which ran for an hour and a half before
          failing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A third prototype ran for 32
          days attached to various automotive transmissions and test
          equipment. It was then dismantled for analysis, and detailed
          reports were prepared. After rejection by large corporations
          and money promoters, gray formed a limited partnership in 1971
          and constructed the fourth EMA prototype. With assistance from
          nearly 200 private citizens, EvGray Enterprises has spent $1.1
          million in the attempt to recycle present lost energy and
          redirect magnetic energy forces with the EMA motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dick Hackenberger, who comes
          from a more conventional background, complements Gray's raw
          genius with 25 years diversified functional and management
          experience in the engineering field. He holds an EE degree
          from Northeastern University and is a senior engineer in the
          Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. Hackenberger
          also held positions with the Sony Corporation of America and
          Sylvania Commercial Electronics, and he has served as an
          engineering consultant to the US Navy.</font> </p>

          include Arthur M. Lange, vice-president in charge of public
          relations, and George C. Demos, vice-president in charge of
          marketing. Lange has served in management and public relations
          capacities with both Ford and General Motors, while Demos has
          worked as division general manager for Control Data, director
          of marketing for RCA, and president of his own manufacturing
          firm.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electromagnetic motor
          has attracted attention from important government agencies,
          including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Air
          Resources Board, and the Department of Transportation.
          Governor Ronald Reagan of California last year presented ray
          and his wife, Evelyn, with a certificate of merit. Others
          indicating interest in the project are congressman Barry
          Goldwater, Jr, Edward Roybal, Del Clawson, and James Corman,
          US Senator Alan Cranston, and state senators Alfred Alquist
          and Nicholas Petris.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">John Brogan, head of the
          Environmental Protection Agency's advanced automotive power
          systems development division, says his 25-man staff has looked
          at approximately 20 alternate engine proposals each week for
          the past two years. He says nearly half of the proposals are
          for "perpetual motion" machines; that is, machinery that would
          produce continuous movement without any outside energy source.
          The concept of perpetual motion violates all known laws of
          thermodynamics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to EvGray, some
          experts believe the EMA is a perpetual-motion engine and is,
          therefore, invalid. Gray himself refutes this belief: "The EMA
          motor is definitely not perpetual motion. Only those in the
          scientific world who understand the theories of physics are
          able to comprehend how our motor works. There's only a handful
          of such persons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The programmer directs
          which magnets are to be energized for what length of time and
          in what polarity. There are several attractions and repulsion
          taking pace at the same time."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The search for the clean
          engine has seen the federal government contribute $23 million
          to the development of new engines in the past two years.
          General Motors spent $36 million last year alone, and Ford
          laid out $20 million. Senator John Tunney of California has
          proposed legislation to divert $900 million from the Highway
          trust Fund into a three-year crash program to develop a clean
          engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile, Edwin gray, after
          12 years of research and development, believes he has found
          the answer for a comparatively meager $1.1 million. Time will
          tell whether or not he is right.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Though harassed by the
          authorities, under-financed and ignored by science, Edwin V.
          Gray, a self-educated Los Angeles inventor, has developed a
          revolutionary electromagnetic motor that promises to greatly
          improve conditions for the world.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A vast new technology is
          opening because gray invented a motor that delivers
          super-efficient horsepower at lower cost with less wear and
          tear than any other device known. His EMS motor takes us a
          giant step closer to the magnificent, whirring power plants
          visualized by science fiction writers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Implications for the auto
          industry alone are staggering: Gray appears to have the answer
          to Detroit's dilemma involving practical electric vehicles.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ed Gray's name may well go
          down in history alongside the likes of Edison, Marconi,
          Goddard, and Bell --- that is, if the establishment will get
          off his back.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A social quality known as
          "resistance to change" and another called the "economic status
          quo" have made grays' struggle to develop and market his motor
          a tale of bitter frustration. Most people would have quit in
          despair long ago.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, tireless
          experimentation and remarkable determination have paid off in
          a technological triumph that brings the heretofore untapped
          source of static electricity into the workhouse of man. Any
          expert can tell you "static electricity will not do work".
          Gray is slowly and doggedly proving the experts are wrong.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His battle is not over, but
          perhaps the tide is turning in his favor. His corporation,
          EvGray Enterprises, is seeking the necessary financing to
          further develop the motor. His efforts were thwarted by
          serious legal problems which recently were resolved when he
          agreed to enter a guilty pleas to a minor Securities and
          Exchange violation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus nearly two years of
          legal entanglements came to a close. The legal costs alone
          have been near ruinous.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He's won some important
          battles, but he could yet lose the war.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray's start in life wasn't
          promising. He was one of six children of a poor Washington DC
          family and grew up in the streets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Few suspected he had the
          stuff of a genius. Like many kids, he was fascinated by
          engines and motors, but his thinking about them went gar
          beyond normal curiosity. He wanted to know more than just what
          made them run.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray dropped out of school
          at 14 and began tinkering with ideas. He was so lacking in
          formal education that he did not realize for some time that
          his thinking was both original and far-advanced.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three things about
          electricity fascinated him: (1) a capacitor can store an
          electric charge and release it on demand, (2) pulses of
          electricity can be sent out and brought back, 93) lightning
          bolts seem to be more powerful when closer to the earth where
          the atmosphere is heaviest.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These were facts known to
          every physicist. But to most such scientists, they were
          unrelated facts. Ed Gray's genius was in correlating this
          knowledge into a new technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I remember getting a shock
          when I grabbed a charged capacitor off a work bench", he
          recalled. "That simple fact never left my mind. Then I watched
          when the government people were testing the first radar across
          the Potomac River --- it stuck in my mind when one of the men
          explained it as 'pulse out, pulse back'.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And I've always been a nut
          about thunderstorms. I watched lightning by the hours. I
          noticed how much stronger it appeared to be when closer to the
          earth and just naturally concluded that more air had something
          to do with it."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These three principles, plus
          a super-secret means of generating and mixing static
          electricity, make up Gray's EMS motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray grew to adulthood,
          married, divorced, and married again. For 22 years, the idea
          of a special new kind of motor turned over and over in his
          mind. Meanwhile, he had moved to Southern California where he
          maintained a workshop and sought the advice of knowledgeable
          men. Bit by bit, his ideas began to take shape.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By 1973, Gray was pounding
          the pavement seeking financial backers. Over the years he
          picked up 788 stockholders, all friends or friends of friends.
          This fact was to stand Gray in good stead later when the Los
          Angeles District Attorney hit him with questionable charges of
          fraud.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From 1957 to 1972, gray
          raised about $2 million to make the EMS motor a reality. That
          same year he incorporated and built the first working model.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Still, more money was a big
          need. He approached top electronics and automotive firms such
          as General Dynamics, Rockwell International, Ford, General
          Motors and the like. Usually he was turned away. "When they
          did listen to me and got a little interested, it turned out
          they wanted 90%. Then it was I who did the turning away", he
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray had interested some top
          experts, though, men who offered the benefits of their
          knowledge to his fledgling firm. They included Richard B.
          Hackenberger, an electronics engineer who had served Sony and
          Sylvania, as well as Fritz Lens, a master machinist who
          understood what Gray was trying to accomplish.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Spring 1973, Gray and his
          associates unveiled the EMS motor to the world.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the workshop, a 6-volt
          car battery rested on a table. Lead wires ran from the battery
          to a series of capacitors which are the key to Gray's
          discovery. The complete system was wired to two
          electromagnets, each weighing a pound and a quarter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first demonstration
          proved that Gray was using a totally different form of
          electrical current --- a powerful but "cold" form of the
          energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the test started, Gray
          said: "Now if you tried to charge those two magnets with juice
          from the battery and make them do what I'm going to make them
          do, you would drain the battery in 30 minutes and the magnets
          would get extremely hot."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fritz Lens activated the
          battery. A voltmeter indicated 3,000 volts. Gray threw a
          switch and there was a loud popping noise. The top magnet flew
          off with a powerful force. Richard Hackenberger caught it with
          his bare hands.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What had happened was that
          gray had used a totally different form of electrical current
          --- a "cold" form of energy. The fact that Hackenberger caught
          the magnet and was not burned was evidence enough of that.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was a moment in history
          perhaps as important as the day in 1877 when Thomas Edison
          threw a switch which lit up a glass bulb that continued to
          glow all that day and part of the next.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The demonstration was
          witnessed by two unbiased experts and the author of this
          article, who later printed the story of what he had seen in a
          national publication.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The amazing thing is that
          only a small per cent of the energy was used. Most of it went
          back into the battery", Hackenberger said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Actually, two "improbables"
          had been demonstrated that day. The second was characterized
          by lack of heat generated in the magnet, excessive heat being
          one of the bg drawbacks in utilizing electronics advancements.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The successful test seemed
          to be Ed Gray's big break. In reality, his real troubles were
          just beginning.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The publicity about the test
          brought Gray to the attention of a firm in Denver which agreed
          to back him with several million in new capital over a period
          of a few years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the time, Gray planned to
          test-market the EMS motor in a radically new auto body called
          the "Fascination", developed by Paul Lewis of Sidney,
          Nebraska.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first prototypes were
          due on January 1, 1974. But then mysterious things started to
          happen --- misfortunes Gray suspects were created by persons
          working to undermine his motor's development. The Fascination
          trial was dropped.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In July 1974, raiders from
          the Los Angeles District Attorney's office descended on Gray's
          plant in Van Nuys. They confiscated plans, records, and the
          latest working prototype of the motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Investigators for the D.A.
          threatened to file a variety of charges against Gray, ranging
          from fraud to grand theft. Yet months passed and no charges
          were brought. The investigators defied all attempts by the
          inventor's lawyers to get the confiscated materials returned.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile, the D.A.'s men
          sought out Gray's investors and tried to convince them to
          prefer charges against him. All refused.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, eight months after
          the raid, the D.A.'s office brought a series of charges
          against Gray, including grand theft, by claiming he had raised
          money from investors by means of a hoax. But all the serious
          charges were dropped when it was proved they were unfounded.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Remaining were two minor
          counts of violating SEC regulations. In late March 1976, Gray
          pleaded guilty to these misdemeanors, paid a fine and was
          freed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The long-drawn legal hassle
          had other serious consequences. The major financing promised
          by the Denver firm was cut off after only a fraction of the
          money had dribbled in. Fortunately, there was enough to enable
          Gray to build a second prototype engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today Gray is very careful
          in the claims he makes for his motor. Even to discuss that
          which has already been proved to the satisfaction of skeptical
          scientists could bring the law down on his head again.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There has been a lot more
          to the suppression of my ideas than meets the eye", he said.
          "It is a wonder we have survived."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But survived he has, and if
          some big vested interest was indeed behind all his woes, it
          just may be too late for such a force to stop an idea whose
          time may have come.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Powerful allies are now
          rallying to his cause. For example, Gray was nominated for
          "Inventor of the Year" by the Los Angeles patent Attorney's
          Association last February.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two highly respected
          scientists, Dr. Norm Chalfin and Dr. Gene Wester of California
          Institute of Technology have publicly endorsed Gray's motor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Chalfin was present when
          Gray demonstrated the latest working model in front of a
          stockholders' meeting.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There is no motor like this
          in the world", Dr. Chalfin told the group. "Ordinary electric
          motors use continuous power. In this system, energy is used
          only during a small fraction of a millisecond. Energy not used
          is returned to an accessory battery for reuse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is cool-running", Dr.
          Chalfin added, putting his hand on the motor. "There is no
          loss of energy in the system."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Chalfin has placed his
          own considerable prestige on the line by writing the text for
          Gray's patent applications, the uneducated inventor finding
          the task of technical writing beyond him.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the same meeting, Dr.
          Gerald Price, Gray's patent counsel, told the stockholders:
          "For discovering a new form of electric power, Mr. Gray has
          been nominated for the annual award presented by the patent
          lawyers of Southern California.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Looking forward to prospects
          of a brighter future, Gray says he wants to get the EMS motor
          into production and prove he has discovered more than even his
          backers understand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gray is advised by his
          lawyers to make no claims. However, this reporter who has
          followed Gray's work for four years has seen and heard enough
          to feel safe in saying that the inventor may be unlocking the
          key to a natural phenomenon referred to as "ball lightning".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the combined use of a
          capacitor discharge and spikes of energy made up of mixed
          static and direct current, Gray conceivably could get more out
          of a battery than a battery has stored in it, simply because
          he is tapping the he reservoir of static electricity in the
          atmosphere as his motor runs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scientists balk at his
          theory, but some day Ed Gray may back them down another notch,
          he has already proved right about the capacitor discharge
          motor idea. With that, has motor already is revolutionary ---
          it runs cool. That in itself could solve a myriad of
          heat-resistance problems for industry. Cool running parts do
          not experience the intense friction and wear out as quickly as
          overheated parts do.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If Ed Gray's motor makes its
          final breakthrough and goes into general production, it may
          make the one-time dropout into a giant in history. It also
          could be a massive boon to mankind in the following ways:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It could power every auto,
          truck, airplane, train and ship without using a drop of
          gasoline, kerosene or diesel fuel. It could cool or heat every
          American home at a fraction of the present day cost. It could
          power the engines of heavy industry --- likewise cheaply.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And it could accomplish all
          this without spitting a single speck of pollution into the
          earth's atmosphere.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One question remains: how
          did Edwin Gray, an unschooled tinkerer, bring together certain
          facts of technology and nature into a device beyond the
          capabilities of brilliant, richly subsidized scientists?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Norm Chalfin has perhaps
          provided the answer. He says Gray's lack of formal education
          actually benefited him in his development of the EMS motor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Someone trained in
          electronics simply would have looked at the concept and said
          it cannot work", Dr Chalfin said. "Gray did not know this, and
          he made it work. As a result, he has provided the world with a
          totally new and exciting technology."</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is disclosed herein an
          electric machine or engine in which a rotor cage having an
          array of electromagnets is rotatable in an array of
          electromagnets, or fixed electromagnets are juxtaposed against
          movable ones. The coils of the electromagnets are connect3ed
          in the discharge path of capacitors charged to relatively high
          voltage and discharged through the electromagnetic coils when
          selected rotor and stator elements are in alignment, or when
          the fixed electromagnets and movable electromagnets are
          juxtaposed. The discharge occurs across spark gaps disclosed
          in alignment with respect to the desired juxtaposition of the
          selected movable and stationary electromagnets. The capacitor
          discharges occur simultaneously through juxtaposition of the
          selected movable electromagnets wound so that their cores are
          in magnetic repulsion polarity, thus resulting in the forced
          motion of movable electromagnetic elements away from the
          juxtaposed stationary electromagnetic elements at the
          discharge, thereby achieving motion. In an engine, the
          discharges occur successively across selected ones of the gaps
          to maintain continuous rotation. Capacitors are recharged
          between successive alignment positions of particular rotor and
          stator electromagnets of the engine.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background of the
            Invention ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. Field of the
            Invention:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is no known engine or
          motor operated on the principle of the present invention, that
          a capacitor charged to a relatively high voltage from a
          low-voltage DC source is discharged across a spark gap to
          provided current through motor drive coils in the discharge
          path, these being solenoids which generate motion by magnetic
          repulsion of juxtaposed pairs of cores. The solenoids are
          preferably configured in motor and stator assemblies to effect
          motion of the rotor element with respect to the stator.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          utilizes this principle to provide a rotary motion machine or
          engine which can develop considerable torque through the
          magnetic repulsion action of rotor and stator cores wound with
          coils through which capacitors are discharged synchronously
          with the positioning of the rotor coils opposite particular
          stator coils. Similarly, a linear action can be achieved with
          a stationary electromagnet juxtaposed against a movable
          electromagnet and the movable electromagnet can perform work
          with a tool or piston attached thereto.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A novel control mechanism is
          associated with the rotor is the engine to position discharge
          elements appropriately to create the desired discharge through
          the electromagnet coils when the juxtaposed rotor and stator
          electromagnets are in alignment. The electromagnets in the
          stator and rotor are so arranged that the control mechanism
          can advance or retard the discharge points relative to
          rotor-stator positions for control of rotational speed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The discharge overshoot or
          back emf from the collapsing fields in the coils from the
          capacitor discharge is used to energize external batteries for
          conservation of power. The recovered energy thus stored may be
          used to operate equipment associated with the engine or motive
          force-producing device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The engine or rotary
          electric machine of the invention is believed to operate on
          the principle of conservation of energy, in that once rotation
          is achieved, current is needed only a the instant of a
          capacitor discharge in order to advance the rotor. The rotor
          moves to the next discharge point on the inertia of the
          repulsion action. The capacitor is recharged during the
          interval and stores the energy until the discharge at the next
          rotor-stator coil coincidence. Thus, the new engine produces
          torque and stores the excess energy for subsequent use.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a linear motion device
          according to the invention, only a single pulse discharge is
          needed to perform work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The applications of the
          engine include use as an electric automotive engine which is
          economical and which can regenerate a part of the energy
          consumed to provide power for other loads in the automotive
          electric vehicle. As a linear actuator an economical use of
          power is possible because each stroke will result from a
          single discharge pulse of a capacitor through a coil.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Prior Art:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An extensive prior art
          search by the applicant uncovered no capacitor-discharge
          operated motor resembling that of the present invention. All
          motors of the patents located in the search employed direct
          electrical connection between coils and electric power
          sources. When selective switching is involved, semiconductor
          devices are employed, such as silicon-controlled rectifiers.
          Capacitors are used only for starting and phasing purposes,

          energized by capacitor discharges through rotor and stator
          electromagnets at the instant of the alignment of a rotor
          electromagnet with a stator electromagnet. The rotor
          electromagnet is repelled from the stator electromagnet by the
          discharge of the capacitor through the coils of both the
          stator and rotor electromagnets at the same instant.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an exemplary rotary
          engine according to this invention, rotor electromagnets may
          be disposed 120 degrees apart on a central shaft and major
          stator electromagnets may be disposed 40 degrees apart in the
          rotor housing about the stator periphery. Other combinations
          of rotor elements and stator elements may be utilized to
          increase torque or rotation rate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In another form, a second
          electromagnet is positioned to one side of each of the major
          stator electromagnets on a center line 13-1/2 degrees from the
          center line of the stator magnet, and these are excited in a
          predetermined pattern or sequence. Similarly to one side of
          each major rotor electromagnet is a second electromagnet
          spaced on a 13-1/2 degree center line from the major rotor
          electromagnet. Electromagnets in both the rotor and stator
          assemblies are identical, the individual electromagnets of
          each being aligned axially and the coils of each being wired
          so that each rotor electromagnetic pole will have the same
          magnetic polarity as the electromagnet in the stator with
          which it is aligned and which it is confronting at the time of
          discharge of the capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Charging of the discharge
          capacitor or capacitors is accomplished by an electrical
          switching circuit wherein electrical energy from a battery or
          other source of DC potential may be applied in alternating
          polarity to ignition coils or other voltage step-up
          arrangements from which a high voltage DC potential is derived
          through rectification by diodes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The capacitor charging
          circuit comprises a pair of high frequency switches which feed
          respective automotive-type ignition coils employed as step-up
          transformers. The "secondary" of each of the ignition coils
          provides a high-voltage square wave to a half-wave rectifier
          to generate a high voltage output pulse of DC energy with each
          switching alternation of the high frequency switcher. Only one
          polarity is used so that a unidirectional pulse is applied to
          the capacitor bank being charged.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Successive unidirectional
          pulses are accumulated on the capacitor or capacitor bank
          until discharged. Discharge of the bank of capacitors occurs
          across a spark gap by arc-over. The gap spacing determines the
          voltage at which discharge or arc-over occurs. An array of
          gaps is created by fixed elements in the engine housing and
          moving elements positioned on the rotor shaft. At the instant
          when the moving gap elements are positioned opposite fixed
          elements during the rotor rotation, a discharge occurs through
          the coils of the aligned rotor and stator electromagnets to
          produce the repulsion action between the stator and rotor
          electromagnet cores.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A plurality of fixed gap
          elements are arrayed in the motor housing to correspond to the
          locations of the stator electromagnets in the housing. The
          rotor gap elements correspond to the positions of the rotor
          electromagnets on the rotor so that at the instant of correct
          alignment of the gaps the capacitors are discharged to produce
          the necessary current through the stator and rotor coils to
          cause the electromagnets to repel one another.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The charging circuits are
          arranged in pairs, and are such that the discharge occurs
          through both rotor and stator windings of the electromagnets,
          which are opposite one another when the spark gap elements are
          aligned and arc-over.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The speed of the rotor can
          be changed by means of a clutch mechanism associated with the
          rotor. The clutch shifts the positions of the rotor gap
          elements to that the discharge will energize the stator coils
          in a manner to advance or retard the time of discharge with
          respect to the normal rotor/stator alignment positions. The
          discharge through the rotor and stator then occurs when the
          rotor has passed the stator 6-2/3 degrees for speed advance.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By causing the discharge to
          occur when the rotor position is approaching the stator, the
          repulsion pulse occurs 6-2/3 degrees before the alignment
          position of the rotor and stator electromagnets, thus slowing
          the speed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The clutch mechanism for
          aligning capacitor discharge gaps for discharge is described
          as a control head. It may be likened to a firing control
          mechanism in an automobile combustion engine in that it
          "fires" the electromagnets and provides a return of any
          discharge overshoot potential back to the battery or other
          energy source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The action of the control
          head is extremely fast. From the foregoing description, it can
          be anticipated that an increase in the speed or a decrease in
          speed of rotation can occur within the period in which the
          rotor electromagnet moves between any pair of adjacently
          located electromagnets in the stator assembly, which are 40
          degrees apart in the exemplary engine according to the
          invention. Thus, speed changes can be effected in a maximum of
          one-ninth of a revolution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotor speed-changing
          action of the control head and its structure are believed to
          be further novel features of the invention, in that they
          maintain normal 120 degree firing positions during uniform
          speed or rotation conditions, but shift to + 6-2/3 degrees
          longer or shorter intervals for speed change by the novel
          shift mechanism in the rotor clutch assembly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, the preferred
          embodiment of this invention is an electric rotary engine
          wherein motor torque is developed by discharge of high
          potential from a bank of capacitors through stator and rotor
          electromagnet coils when the electromagnets are in alignment.
          The capacitors are charged from batteries by a switching
          mechanism, and are discharged across spark gaps set to achieve
          the discharge of the capacitor charge voltage through the
          electromagnetic coils when the gaps and predetermined rotor
          and stator electromagnet pairs are in alignment.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As hereinbefore mentioned,
          the basic principle of operation of the engine of the
          invention is the discharge of a capacitor, across a spark gap
          through an inductor. When a pair of inductors is used, and the
          respective magnetic cores thereof are arranged opposite and
          another in magnetic polarity repulsion relation, the discharge
          through them causes the cores to repel each other with
          considerable force.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the electrical
          schematic diagram of Figure 1, a battery 10 energizes a
          pulse-producing vibrator mechanism 16, which may be of the
          magnetic type incorporating an armature 15 moving between
          contacts 13 and 14, or of the transistor type (not shown) with
          which a high frequency bipolar pulsed output is produced in
          primary 17 of transformer 20. The pulse amplitude is stepped
          up in secondary 19 of transformer 20. Wave form 19a represents
          the bi-directional or bipolar pulsed output. A diode rectifier
          21 produces a unidirectional pulse train, as indicated at 21a,
          to charge capacitor 26. A delay coil 23 is connected in series
          with the unipolar pulsed output to capacitor 26. Successive
          unidirectional pulses of wave 21a charge capacitor 26 to a
          high level, as indicated at 26a, until the voltage amplitude
          at point A reaches the breakdown potential of spark gap 30. At
          the breakdown of spark gap 30, capacitor 26 discharges across
          the arc created through the inductor coil 28. A current pulse
          is produced which magnetizes core 28a. Simultaneously, another
          substantially identical charging system 32 produces a
          discharge through inductor 27 across spark gap 29 to magnetize
          core 27a. Cores 28s, 27a are wound with coils 28, 27 so that
          their magnetic polarities are the same. As the cores 27a, 28a
          confront one another, they tend to fly apart when the
          discharge occurs through coils 27 and 28 because of repulsion
          of identical magnetic poles, as indicated by arrow 31. If core
          28a is fixed or stationary and core 27a is movable, then core
          27a may have tools 33 attached to it to perform work when the
          capacitor discharges.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figures 1 and
          2, a DC electrical source or battery 10 energizes pulsators 36
          (including at least two vibrators 16 as previously described)
          when switch 11 between the battery 10 and pulsator 36 is
          closed, to apply relatively high frequency pulses to the
          primaries of transformers 20. The secondaries of transformers
          20 are step-up windings which apply bipolar pulses, such as
          pulses 19a (Figure 1) to the diodes in converter 38. The
          rectified unidirectional pulsating output of each of the
          diodes in converter 38 is passed through delay coils 23, 24,
          thus forming a harness 37 wound about the case of the engine,
          as hereinafter described, which is believed to provide a
          static floating flux field. The outputs from delay lines 37
          drive respective capacitors in banks 39 to charge the
          capacitors therein to a relatively high charge potential. A
          programmer and rotor and stator magnet control array 40, 41,
          42 is formed by spark gaps positioned, as hereinafter
          described, so that at predetermined positions of the rotor
          during rotation of the engine, as hereinafter described,
          selected capacitors of capacitor banks 39 will discharge
          across the spark gaps through the rotor and stator
          electromagnets 43, 44. The converters 38, magnetic harness 37,
          capacitor banks 39, programmer 40, and controls 41, 42 form a
          series circuit path across the secondaries of transformer 20
          to the ground, or point of reference potential, 45. The
          capacitor banks 39 are discharged across the spark gaps of
          programmer 40 (the rotor and stator magnet controls 41, 42).
          The discharge occurs through the coils of stator and rotor
          electromagnets 43, 44 to ground 45. Stator and rotor
          electromagnets are similar to those shown at 27, 27a, 28, 28a
          in Figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The discharge through the
          coils of stator and rotor electromagnets 43, 44 is accompanied
          by a discharge overshoot or return pulse, the output of which
          is applied in an appropriate polarity to a secondary battery
          10a to store this excess energy. The overshoot pulse returns
          to battery 10a because after discharge the only path open is
          that to battery 10a, since the gaps in 40, 41, and 42 have
          broken down, because the capacitors in banks 39 are discharged
          and have not yet recovered the high voltage charge from the
          high frequency pulsers 36 and converter rectifier units 38.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the event of a misfire in
          the programmer control circuits 40, 41, 42,the capacitors are
          discharged through a rotor safety discharge circuit 46 and
          returned to batteries 10-10a, adding to their capacity. The
          circuit 46 is connected between the capacitor banks 39 and
          batteries 10, 10a.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figure 3, a
          motor or engine 49 according to the present invention is shown
          connected with the automotive transmission 48. The
          transmission 48 represents one of many forms of loads to which
          the engine may be applied. A motor housing 50 encase the
          operating mechanism hereinafter described. The programmer 40
          is axially mounted at one end of this housing. Through
          aperr4es 51, 52, a belt 53 couples to a pulley 57 (not shown
          in this view) and to an alternator 54 attached to housing 50.
          A pulley 55 on the alternator has two grooves, one for belt 53
          to the drive pulley, and the other for a belt 58 coupled to a
          pulley 59 on a pump 60 attached to housing 50. A terminal box
          61 on the housing interconnects means between the battery

          coupling flanges 67 and 71. The air flow tends to cool the
          engine, and the air may preferably be maintained at a constant
          temperature and humidity so that a constant spark gap
          discharge condition is maintained. A clutch mechanism 80 is
          provided on programmer 40.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figures 4, 5,

          electromagnet coil assembly sets mounted thereon, two of which
          are shown in Figure 4, on 85 at 85a and 85b, and on 86 at 86a
          and 86b. One of the third electromagnet coil assemblies,
          designated 871, is shown in Figure 5, viewed from the shaft

          85a, 85b, there are three of each of the front and back pairs
          of electromagnetic assemblies. Similarly, as shown in Figures

          the operation of the rotor 81-88 rotating within the stator
          housing 50 of an engine according to this invention, the
          positions of rotor electromagnets 91 and stator electromagnets
          117 are initially exactly in line at the 13-1/2 degree
          peripheral starting position marked on the vertical center
          line of figure 5. The winding direction of the coils of these
          magnets is such that a DC current through the coils 119 will
          produce a particular identical magnetic polarity on each of
          the juxtaposed surfaces 125 of magnets 117 and 126 of magnet
          91 (Figure 5). Figures 6 and 16 illustrate the next sep in
          motion wherein the two major electromagnets, 120 in the stator
          and 121 in the rotor, are in alignment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the DC-discharges from
          the appropriate capacitors in banks 39 occur simultaneously
          across spark gaps through the coils 119 of electromagnets 117
          and 91, at the instant of their alignment, their cores 118
          will repel one another to cause rotor assembly 81-88 to rotate
          clockwise in the direction indicated by arrow 127. The system
          does not move in the reverse direction because it has been
          started in the clockwise direction by the alternator motor 54
          shown in Figure 3, or by some other starter means. If started
          counterclockwise, the rotor will continue to move
          counterclockwise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As hereinbefore noted, the
          discharge of any capacitor occurs over a very short interval
          across its associated spark gap, and the resulting magnetic
          repulsion action imparts motion the rotor. The discharge event
          occurs when electromagnets 117 and 91 are in alignment. As
          shown in Figure 5, rotor electromagnet 91a is aligned with
          stator electromagnet 117c, and rotor electromagnet 91b is
          aligned with stator electromagnet 1173 at the same time that
          similar electromagnets 117 and 91 are aligned. A discharge
          occurs through all six of these electromagnets simultaneously
          (that is, 117, 91; 117c, 91a; 117e and 91b). A capacitor and a
          spark gap are required for each coil of each
          electromagnet.&nbsp; Where, as in the assembly shown in Figure
          8, front and back pairs are used, both the axial in-line front
          and back coils are energized simultaneously by the discharge
          from a single capacitor or from a bank of paralleled
          capacitors such as 25, 26 (Figure 1). Although Figures 4 and 8
          indicate the used of front and back electromagnets, it should
          be evident that only a single electromagnet in any stator
          position and a corresponding single electromagnet in the rotor
          position, may be utilized to accomplish the repulsion action
          of the rotor with respect to the stator. As stated, each
          electromagnet requires a discharge from a single capacitor or
          capacitor bank across a spark gap for it to be energized, and
          the magnetic polarity of the juxtaposed magnetic core faces
          must be the same, in order to effect the repulsive action to
          produce the rotary motion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figures 5 and
          6, the repulsion action causes the rotor to move 13-1/3
          degrees clockwise, while electromagnets 91, 91a and 91b move
          away from the electromagnets 117, 117c and 117e to bring
          electromagnets 121, 121a and 121b into respective alignment
          with electromagnets 120a, 120d and 120f. At this time, a
          capacitor discharge across a spark-gap into their coils 123
          occurs, thus moving the rotor. Another 13-1/3 degree ahead, as
          shown in Figure 7, major electromagnets 121, 121a and 121b
          come into alignment with minor electromagnets 117a, 117d and
          117f, at which time a discharge occurs to repeat the repulsion
          action, this action continuing as long as DC power is applied
          to the system to charge the capacitors in the capacitor banks.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 18 further
          illustrates the sequencing of the capacitor discharges across
          appropriate spark gap terminal pairs. Nine single stator coils
          and three single rotor coils are shown with their respective
          interconnections with the spark gaps and capacitors with which
          they are associated for discharge. When the appropriate spark
          gap terminals are aligned, at the points in the positioning of
          the rotor assembly for most effective repulsion action of
          juxtaposed electromagnet cores, the discharge of the
          appropriate charged capacitors across the associated spark gap
          occurs through the respective coils. The capacitors are
          discharged in sets of three through sets of three coils at
          each discharge position, as the rotor moves through the rotor
          positions. In Figure 18, the rotor electromagnets are
          positioned linearly, rather than on a circular base, to show
          the electrical action of an electric engine according to the
          invention. These motor electromagnets 201, 202, and 203 are
          aligned with stator electromagnets 213, 214, and 215 at 0
          degrees, 120 degrees and 450 degrees respectively. The stator
          electromagnets are correspondingly shown in a linear schematic
          as if rolled out of the stator assembly and laid side by side.
          For clarity of description, the capacitors associated with the
          rotor operation 207, 208, 209 and 246, 247, 248, 249, 282 ad
          283 are arranged in vertical alignment with the respective
          positions of the rotor coils 201, 202, 203 as they move from
          left to right, this corresponding to clockwise rotation of the
          rotor. The stator coils 213, 214, 215, 260, 261, 262, 263,
          264, 265, 266, etc., and capacitor combinations are arranged
          side by side, again to facilitate description.</font> </p>

          disc 230 is part of the rotor, as indicated by mechanical
          linkage 290, it can be seen that terminal U 222 creates a pair
          of gaps with gap terminals 223 and 224, respectively. The
          stator electromagnets are correspondingly shown in linear
          schematic as if rolled out of the stator assembly and laid

          insulative disc 230 is part of the rotor, as indicated by
          mechanical linkage 290, it can be seen that terminal U 222
          creates a pair of gaps with terminals 223 and 224,
          respectively. Thus, when the voltage on capacitor 216 from
          charging circuit 219 is of a value which will arc over the air
          spaces between 222a and 223, and between 222b and 224, the
          capacitor 216 will discharge into the coil of electromagnet
          213 to ground. Similarly gap terminal U 225 forms a dual spark
          gap with terminals 226 and 227 to result in arc-over when the
          voltage on capacitor 217, charged by charging circuit 220,
          discharges into the coil of electromagnet 214. Also, U-gap
          terminal 228 with terminals 228c and 228d, creates a spark gap
          with terminals 229 and 230 to discharge capacitor 218, charged
          by charging circuit 221, into coil 215. At the same time,
          rotor coils 201, 202 and 203 across gaps 201a-204, 202b-205
          and 203c-206 each receives a discharge from respective

          action causes the rotor assembly to move to position 2 where a
          new simultaneous group of discharges occurs into rotor coils
          201, 202, and 203 from capacitors 246, 248, and 282 across
          gaps 201a-240, 202b-242 and 203c-244. Simultaneously, because
          gap U-elements 222, 225, and 228 have also moved to position 2
          with the rotor assembly, capacitor 261 is discharged through
          electromagnet coil 260, capacitor 265 is discharged through

          through electromagnet coil 168 in alignment with position 2 of
          the rotor electromagnet coils, thus to cause the rotor

          are operated continuously from a battery source, as described
          earlier with reference to Figure 1, to constantly recharge the
          capacitors to which each is connected. Those versed in the art
          will appreciate that, as each capacitor discharges across an
          associated spark gap, the resulting drop in potential across
          the gap renders the gap an open circuit until such time as the
          capacitor can recharge to the arc-over level of the gap. This
          recharge to a discharge potential occurs before a rotor

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mechanical schematic
          diagram of Figure 17 further clarifies the operation of the
          spark-gap discharge programming system. A forward disc 236 of
          an electrically insulative material, has thereon the set of
          U-shaped gap terminal connectors previously described. These
          are positioned at 0 degrees, 120 degrees and 240 degrees
          respectively. In Figure 17, schematic representations of the
          position of the coil and capacitor combinations at the start
          of a cycle are shown to correspond to the description
          hereinabove with reference to Figure 18. Accordingly, the coil
          and capacitor combinations 213/216, 214/217, and 215/218 are
          shown connected with their gap terminals, respectively,
          223/224, 226/227, and 229/230. On the rotor coil and capacitor
          connection three separate discs 291, 292 and 293 are shown,
          each with a single gap terminal. The discs 291-293 are rotated
          so as to position their respective gap terminals 201a, 202b
          and 203c at 120 degree increments, with the 0 degree position
          corresponding to the 0 degree position of U-gap terminal 222
          on disc 230.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Representative gap terminals
          are shown about the peripheries of discs 230, 291-193 to
          clearly indicate how, as the discs turn in unison, the gap
          alignments correspond so that three rotor coil/capacitors
          always line up at 120 degree intervals about the rotary path,
          producing an alignment every 40 degrees, there being nine
          stator coils. Thus there are three simultaneous discharges
          into stator coils and three into rotor coils at each 40 degree
          position. Nine positions displaced 40 degrees apart provide a
          total of 27 discharge points for capacitors into the stator
          coils in one revolution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be understood that,
          as illustrated in Figures 17 and 18, nine individual
          electromagnet coils are shown in the stator and three in the
          rotor, in order to show in its simplest form how the three
          rotor electromagnets are stepped forward from the alignment
          with three of the stator electromagnets, when the appropriate
          spark gaps are in alignment, to effect the discharge of
          capacitors through juxtaposed pairs of rotor/stator
          electromagnets. The repulsion moves the rotor electromagnet
          from the stator electromagnet to the next alignment position
          advanced at an arc of 40 degrees from the preceding alignment
          position. In the interval until another rotor electromagnet,
          120 degrees removed, is aligned with the stator electromagnet
          that has just been excited, the associated capacitor is
          recharged to a potential which will cause the spark gap to
          break down to produce another discharge of this capacitor on
          the next revolution. Thus the rotor moves from one position to
          the next, with capacitor discharges occurring each 40 degrees
          of rotation, a total of nine per revolution. It should be
          obvious that, with other rotor/stator combinations, the number
          of electromagnet coincidences and spark-gap discharges will
          vary. For example, with the coil pairs shown in Figures 4
          through 8, a total of 27 discharges will occur. Although there
          are 18 stator electromagnets and three rotor electromagnets,
          the discharge pattern is determined by the specific spark gap
          arrangement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotor/stator
          configuration of Figures 5 and 8, involving the major and
          minor pairs of electromagnets such as 85a and 104a (the terms
          "major" and "minor" referring to the difference in size of the
          elements), include nine pairs of electromagnets in the stator,
          such as 104a, with three electromagnet pairs of the rotor,
          such as 85a. Because of the 13-1/3 degree separation between
          the major and minor electromagnets in the rotor pair 85a, with
          the same separation of minor and major electromagnets of the
          stator pair 104a, the sequence of rotation and discharge
          described above, with respect to the illustrative example of
          Figure 5, involves the following:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) A minor element 117 of
          stator pair 104a is aligned with the minor element 91 of rotor
          pair 85a. On the discharge, this moves the rotor ahead 13-1/3
          degrees.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) The major rotor element
          122 of the pair 85a now is aligned with the major stator
          element 120b of the next electromagnet pair, in the stator
          array as shown in Figure 6. On the discharge, the rotor moves
          ahead 13-1/3 degrees.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) This brings the minor
          rotor electromagnet 91 into alignment with the major stator
          element 120 b of pair 104d, and the major electromagnet 122
          (just discharged) of pair 85a into alignment with minor
          electromagnet 117b of pair 104d, and the rotor spark gap
          elements into alignment with a different position of gap
          elements connected with capacitors not discharged in the
          previous position of the rotor. It should be remembered at
          this point that it is the positioning of a rotatable spark gap
          array, similar to that illustrated in Figures 17 and 18, which
          controls the time of discharge of capacitors connected to
          these gap terminals. Therefore, any electromagnet can be
          energized twice successively from separate capacitors as the
          motor brings appropriate gap terminals into alignment with the
          coil terminals of a particular electromagnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, although major
          electromagnet 120b of pair 104d has just been energized as
          described above, it can now be energized again along with
          minor rotor electromagnet 91 in step 3, because the rotor
          moved to a new set of terminals of the spark gap arrays
          connected with capacitors not yet discharged. These capacitors
          now discharge through rotor electromagnet 91 and stator
          electromagnet 120b, causing rotor to move ahead another 13-1/3
          degrees, thus again aligning two minor electromagnets again,
          these being 117b of stator pair 104 d and 91 of rotor pair
          85a. The rotor has now moved 40 degrees since step 1 above.
          The sequence is repeated, and it is to be noted that at each
          13-1/3 degree step, the discharges rotate the rotor another
          13-1/3 degrees. There are 27 steps per revolution with nine
          stator coil pairs. The discharge sequence is not uniform, as
          is shown in Table 1. In the stator, three major electromagnets
          120 degrees apart are energized twice in sequence followed by
          a hiatus of one step while three minor electromagnets of the
          stator, 120 degrees apart, are energized during the hiatus. In
          the rotor the major electromagnets are energized during a
          hiatus step following two minor electromagnet energization
          steps. A total of 27 energizations are thus accomplished in
          the nine pairs of coils of the stator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Table 1, the leftmost
          column depicts the location of each rotor arm 85, 86, 87 at an
          arbitrarily selected step No. 1 position. For example, in step
          1 rotor arm 85 has a minor stator and minor rotor
          electromagnet in alignment for capacitors to discharge through
          them simultaneously at the 13-1/3 degree position.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Similarly, in step 1 rotor
          arm 86 is at the 133-1/2 degree position with a minor rotor
          and minor stator electromagnet in alignment for discharge.
          Simultaneously, rotor arm 87 is at the 253-1/3 degree position
          with a minor rotor and minor stator in alignment for capacitor
          discharge therethrough. The other steps of the sequence are
          apparent from Table 1, for each position of the three rotor
          arms at any step and the juxtapositions of respective stator
          and rotor electromagnet elements at that position.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the simplified motor
          arrangement shown in schematic form in Figure 18, with single
          electromagnet configuration the alignment is uniform and the
          discharge sequences follow sequentially.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As hereinafter mentioned, a
          change in speed is effected by displacing the stator spark gap
          terminals on the rotor (shown at 236 in Figures 17 and 18)
          either counter-clockwise or clockwise 6-2/3 degrees so that
          the discharge position of the stator electromagnets is
          displaced 6-2/3 degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise
          of the rotor electromagnet at the time of discharge. Referring
          to Figures 11 to 15, the simultaneous discharge of selected
          capacitors into the electromagnets so displaced results in a
          deceleration at the time the rotor electromagnet is just
          approaching the associated stator, or an acceleration if the
          rotor electromagnet is just leaving its associated stator
          electromagnet. In each event, there is a repulsive reaction
          between the stator and rotor electromagnets, so that if the
          rotor is approaching the stator, there is a slow-down and if
          the rotor is receding from the stator there is a speed-up.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figure 11,
          clutch mechanism 304 about shaft 111 is operated
          electromagnetically in conventional manner to displace the
          spark-gap mechanism 236 which is operated in appropriate
          matching alignment with the rotor spark-gap discs 291, 292,
          293. Clutch 304 has a fixed drive element 311 containing an
          electromagnetic drive coil (not shown) and a motor element 310
          which, when the electromagnetic drive coil is energized, can
          be operated by a direct current. The operation of motor
          element 310 brings into operation spark gap elements 224r,
          223r or 223f, 224f of the system shown in Figures 4, 5, and 8,
          as illustrated in Figure 19.The fixed stator coil spark gap
          terminal pairs 223, 224 and 266, 267 are arrayed about a
          cylindrical frame 322 which is fabricated in insulative
          material. In the illustrative example of Figures 17 and 18,
          there are nine such spark gap terminal pairs about the
          periphery of cylinder frame 324. In the engine of Figures 4 to
          8, a total of 27 such spark gap pairs are involved. In
          addition, although not shown in the drawing, there are also
          pairs of terminals, such as 223r or 223f, 224r or 224f and
          266r or 226f, 267r or 267f, displaced 6-2/3 degrees on either
          side of the pairs 223, 224, or 266, 267, and all other pairs
          in the spark gap array, the letters r and f denoting "retard"
          and "faster'. The latter displaced pairs are used in the
          control of speed of the engine rotor. The displaced pairs not
          shown are involved with the operation of clutch 304, the speed
          changing control element.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Clutch 304 is associated
          with shaft 111 in that the movable element 10 draws clutch
          disc element on shaft 111 away form clutch disc element 322
          when energized by a voltage of appropriate polarity applied to
          its motor electromagnet 311. Such clutch drives are well known
          in the art.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The clutch mechanism 304 of
          Figures 11 and 19, when not energized is in the configuration
          shown in Figure 11. The energized configuration of clutch 304
          is not specifically illustrated. Upon energization, spark-gap
          element 222 on disc 236 is displaced rightward, as viewed in
          Figure 11, by broken lines 236x, into alignment with the
          positions of fixed spark-gap terminals 223f, 224f and 267r,
          266r. When the disc is in position 236x, the flattened edge
          332 of pin 330 in disc 325 rides on surface 350 of disc 322.
          Normally, the flattened edges 351 of pins 330 are engaged
          against the flat edge 352 in recess 331 of disc 322. The
          displacement of disc 322 on shaft 111 is effected by the
          action of clutch 304 against spring 314 (Figure 11). An
          electric switch (not shown) of clutch mechanism 304 energizes
          it from a DC power source, and has two positions, one for
          deceleration and one for acceleration. In either position,
          clutch 304 is engaged to pull clutch disc 322 from clutch disc
          325, momentarily. For the decelerate or accelerate position,
          the displaced alignment of spark gap elements 222 is with the
          224f, 223f and the 224r, 223r spark-gap terminal elements.
          However, only the 224f, 223f spark-gap elements are switched
          into operation with appropriate capacitors for the accelerate
          position, while in the decelerate position only the 223r and
          224r spark-gap elements are switched into the circuit with
          their associated capacitors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, when insulative
          disc 236 is displaced by clutch 304, its gap terminals 22, 225
          and 228 (Figures 14 and 18) are all displaced into the
          alignment position of 236x so as to engage the r and f lines
          of fixed spark gap elements. Although the accelerate and
          decelerate positions of disc 236 are the same, it is the
          switching into operation of the 223, 224 or 266, 267 exemplary
          r or f pairs of terminals which determine whether speed up or
          slow down action of the rotor will occur.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The momentary displacement
          of clutch disc 322 from clutch disc 325 results in rotation of
          disc 325 about disc 322 through an angle 0f 120 degrees. The
          detent ball and spring mechanism 320, 321 in disc 325
          positions itself between open detent dimple 328 and a
          succeeding one 328 at a position 120 degrees away on disc 325.
          As stated, flat 332 of pin 330 rides on surface 350 of disc
          322, and pin 330 leaves the pin-holding groove 331/352 along
          ramp 333 in disc 322 during the momentary lifting of disc 322
          by clutch 304. Pin 330 falls back into the next groove 331 at
          point 120 degrees further on about disc 322. Pin 330 falls
          into place in groove 331 on ramp 334. Pins 330 are rotatable
          in their sockets 353, so that for either clockwise or
          counterclockwise rotation, the flat 351 will engage the flat
          352 by the particular ramp it encounters.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The deceleration or
          acceleration due to the action of clutch 304 thus occurs
          within a 120-degree interval of rotation of disc 325. Disc 322
          during this interval may only move a fraction of this arc.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There has been described
          hereinabove an electromotive engine system wherein at least
          one electromagnet is in a fixed position and a second
          electromagnet of similar configuration is juxtaposed with it
          in a magnetic polarity relationship such that, when the cores
          of the electromagnets are energized, the juxtaposed core faces
          repel one another. One core being fixed and the second core
          being free to move, any attachments to the second
          electromagnet will move with it. Hence, if a plurality of
          fixed cores are positioned about a circular confining housing,
          and, within the housing, cores on a shaft are free to move,
          the shaft is rotationally urged each time the juxtaposed fixed
          and rotatable cores are in alignment and energized. Both the
          fixed and the movable cores are connected to spark gap
          terminal elements, and the associated other terminal elements
          of the spark gaps are connected to capacitors which are
          charged to a high voltage from pulsed unipolar signal
          generators. These capacitors are discharged through the
          electromagnets across the spark gaps. By switching selected
          groups of capacitors into selected pairs of spark gap elements
          for discharge through the electromagnets, the rotor of the
          circular array systems is accelerated and decelerated.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Disclosed is an Electrical
          Driving and Recovery System for a High Frequency environment.
          The recovery system can be applied to drive present day
          direct-current or alternating-current loads for better
          efficiency. It has a low-voltage source coupled to a vibrator,
          a transformer and a bridge-type rectifier to provide a high
          voltage pulsating signal to a first capacitor. Where a
          high-voltage source is otherwise available, it may be coupled
          directly to a bridge-type rectifier, causing a pulsating
          signal to the first capacitor. The first capacitor in turn is
          coupled to a high voltage anode of an electrical conversion
          switching element tube. The switching element tube also
          includes a low voltage anode which is connected to a voltage
          source by a commutator and a switching element tube. Mounted
          around the high voltage anode is a charge receiving plate
          which is coupled to an inductive load to transmit a high
          voltage discharge from the switching element tube to the load.
          Also coupled to the load is a second capacitor for storing the
          back EMF created by the collapsing electrical field of the
          load when the current to the load is blocked. The second
          capacitor is coupled to the voltage source. When adapted to
          present day direct-current or alternating-current devices the
          load could be a battery or capacitor to enhance the
          productivity of electrical energy.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description of the
            Preferred Embodiment ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the present invention
          is susceptible of various modifications and alternative
          constructions, an embodiment is shown in the drawings and will
          herein be described in detail. It should be understood however
          that it is not the intention to limit the invention to the
          particular form disclosed; but, on the contrary, the invention
          is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternative
          constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the
          invention as expressed in the appended claims.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is disclosed herein an
          electrical driving system which, on theory, will convert low
          voltage electric energy from a source such as an electric
          storage battery to a high potential, high current energy pulse
          that is capable of developing a working force at the inductive
          output of the device that is more efficient than that which is
          capable of being developed directly from the energy source.
          The improvement in efficiency is further enhanced by the
          capability of the device to return that portion of the initial
          energy developed, and not used by the inductive load in the
          production of mechanical energy, to the same or second energy
          reservoir or source for use elsewhere, or for storage.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This system accomplishes the
          results stated above by harnessing the "electrostatic" or
          "impulse" energy created by a high-intensity spark generated
          within a specially constructed electrical conversion switching
          element tube. This element utilizes a low-voltage anode, a
          high-voltage anode, and one or more "electrostatic" or charge
          receiving grids. These grids are of a physical size, and
          appropriately positioned, as to be compatible with the size of
          the tube, and therefore, directly related to the amount of
          energy to be anticipated when the device is operating.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The low-voltage anode may
          incorporate a resistive device to aid in controlling the
          amount of current drawn from the energy source. This
          low-voltage anode is connected to the energy source through a
          mechanical commutator or a solid-state pulser that controls
          the timing and duration of the energy spark within the
          element. The high-voltage anode is connected to a high-voltage
          potential developed by the associated circuits. An energy
          discharge occurs within the element when the external control
          circuits permit. This short duration, high-voltage,
          high-current energy pulse is captured by the "electrostatic"
          grids within the tube, stored momentarily, then transferred to
          the inductive output load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The increase in efficiency
          anticipated in converting the electrical energy to mechanical
          energy within the inductive load is attributed to the
          utilization of the most optimum timing in introducing the
          electrical energy to the load device, for the optimum period
          of time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further enhancement of
          energy conservation is accomplished by capturing a significant
          portion of the energy generated by the inductive load when the
          useful energy field is collapsing. This energy is normally
          dissipated in load losses that are contrary to the desired
          energy utilization, and have heretofore been accepted because
          no suitable means had been developed to harness this energy
          and restore it to a suitable energy storage device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention is
          concerned with two concepts or characteristics. The first of
          these characteristics is observed with the introduction of an
          energizing current through the inductor. The inductor creates
          a contrary force (counter-electromotive force or CEMF) that
          opposes the energy introduced into the inductor. This CEMF
          increases throughout the time the introduced energy is
          increasing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In normal applications of an
          alternating-current to an inductive load for mechanical
          applications, the useful work of the inductor is accomplished
          prior to terminating the application of energy. The excess
          energy applied is thereby wasted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Previous attempts to provide
          energy inputs to an inductor of time durations limited to that
          period when the optimum transfer of inductive energy to
          mechanical energy is occurring, have been limited by the
          ability of any such device to handle the high current required
          to optimize the energy transfer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second characteristic is
          observed when the energizing current is removed from the
          inductor. As the current is decreased, the inductor generates
          an EMF that opposes the removal of current or, in other words,
          produces an energy source at the output of the inductor that
          simulates the original energy source, reduced by the actual
          energy removed from the circuit by the mechanical load. This
          "regenerated", or excess, energy has previously been lost due
          to a failure to provide a storage capability for this energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this invention, a
          high-voltage, high-current, short duration energy pulse is
          applied to the inductive load by the conversion element. This
          element makes possible the use of certain of that energy
          impressed within an arc across a spark-gap, without the
          resultant deterioration of circuit elements normally
          associated with high energy electrical arcs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention also provides
          for capture of a certain portion of the energy induced by the
          high inductive kick produced by the abrupt withdrawal of the
          introduced current. This abrupt withdrawal of current is
          attendant upon the termination of the stimulating arc. The
          voltage spike so created is imposed upon a capacitor that
          couples the attendant current to a secondary energy storage
          device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A novel, but not essential,
          circuit arrangement provides for switching the energy source
          and the energy storage device. This switching may be so
          arranged as to actuate automatically at predetermined times.
          The switching may be at specified periods determined by
          experimentation with a particular device, or may be actuated
          by some control device that measures the relative energy
          content of the two energy reservoirs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figure 1,
          the system 10 will be described in additional detail. The
          potential for the high-voltage anode, 12 of the conversion
          element 14 is developed across the capacitor 16. This voltage
          is produced by drawing a low current from a battery source 18
          through the vibrator 20. The effect of the vibrator is to
          create a pulsating input to the transformer 22. The turns
          ratio of the transformer is chosen to optimize the voltage
          applied to a bridge-type rectifier 24. The output of the
          rectifier is then a series of high-voltage pulses of modest
          current. When the available source is already of the high
          voltage, AC type, it may be coupled directly to the
          bridge-type rectifier.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By repetitious application
          of these output pulses from the bridge-type rectifier to the
          capacitor 16, a high-voltage, high-level charge is built up on
          the capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Control of the conversion
          switching element tube is maintained by a commutator 26. A
          series of contacts mounted radially about a shaft, or a
          solid-state switching device sensitive to time or other
          variable may be used for this control element. A switching
          element tube type one-way energy path 28 is introduced between
          the commutator device and the conversion switching element
          tube to prevent high energy arcing at the commutator current
          path. When the switching element tube is closed, current from
          the voltage source 18 is routed through a resistive element 30
          and a low voltage anode 32. This causes a high energy
          discharge between the anodes within the conversion switching
          element tube 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The energy content of the
          high energy pulse is electrostatically coupled to the
          conversion grids 34 of the conversion element. This
          electrostatic charge is applied through an output terminal 60
          (Figure 2) across the load inductance 36, inducing a strong
          electromagnetic field about the inductive load. The intensity
          of this electromagnetic field is determined by the high
          electromotive potential developed upon the electrostatic grids
          and the very short time duration required to develop the
          energy pulse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the inductive load is
          coupled magnetically to a mechanical load, a strong initial
          torque is developed that may be efficiently utilized to
          produce physical work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Upon cessation of the energy
          pulse (arc) within the conversion switching element tube the
          inductive load is decoupled, allowing the electromagnetic
          field about the inductive load to collapse. The collapse of
          this energy field induces within the inductive load a counter
          EMF. This counter EMF creates a high positive potential across
          a second capacitor which, in turn, is induced into the second
          energy storage device or battery 40 as a charging current. The
          amount of charging current available to the battery 40 is
          dependent upon the initial conditions within the circuit at
          the time of discharge within the conversion switching element
          tube and the amount of mechanical energy consumed by the work
          load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A spark-gap protection
          device 42 is included in the circuit to protect the inductive
          load and the rectifier elements from unduly large discharge
          currents. Should the potentials within the circuit exceed
          predetermined values, fixed by the mechanical size and spacing
          of the elements within the protective device, the excess
          energy is dissipated (bypassed) by the protective device to
          the circuit common (electrical ground).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Diodes 44 and 46 bypass the
          excess overshoot generated when the "Energy Conversion
          Switching Element Tube" is triggered.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A switching element 48
          allows either energy storage source to be used as the primary
          energy source, while the other battery is used as the energy
          retrieval unit. The switch facilitates interchanging the
          source and the retrieval unit at optimum intervals to be
          determined by the utilization of the conversion switching
          element tube. This switching may be accomplished manually or
          automatically, as determined by the choice of switching
          element from among a large variety readily available for the
          purpose.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 2, 3, and 4 show the
          mechanical structure of the conversion switching element tube
          14. An outer housing 50 may be of any insulative material such
          as glass. The anodes 12 and 22 and grids 34a and 34b are
          firmly secured by nonconductive spacer material 54, and 56.
          The resistive element 30 may be introduced into the
          low-voltage anode path to control the peak currents through
          the conversion switching element tube. The resistive element
          may be of a piece, or it may be built of one or more resistive
          elements to achieve the desired result.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The anode material may be
          identical for each anode, or may be of differing materials for
          each anode, as dictated by the most efficient utilization of
          the device, as determined by appropriate research at the time
          of production for the intended use.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The shape and spacing of the
          electrostatic grids is also susceptible to variation with
          application (voltage, current, and energy requirements).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is the contention of the
          inventor that by judicious mating of the elements of the
          conversion switching element tube, and the proper selection of
          the components of the circuit elements of the system, the
          desired theoretical results may be achieved. It is the
          inventor's contention that this mating and selection process
          is well within the capabilities of intensive research and
          development technique.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let it be stated here that
          substituting a source of electric alternating-current subject
          to the required current and/or voltage shaping and/or timing,
          either prior to being considered a primary energy source, or
          thereafter, should not be construed to change the described
          utilization or application of primary energy in any way. Such
          energy conversion is readily achieved by any of a multitude of
          well established principles. The preferred embodiment of this
          invention merely assumes optimum utilization and optimum
          benefit from this invention when used with portable energy
          devices similar in principle to the wet-cell or dry-cell
          battery.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention proposes to
          utilize the energy contained in an internally generated
          high-voltage electric spike (energy pulse) to electrically
          energize an inductive load; this inductive load being then
          capable of converting the energy so supplied into a usefu1
          electrical or mechanical output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operation the
          high-voltage, short-duration electric spike is generated by
          discharging the capacitor 16 across the spark-gap in the
          conversion switching element tube. The necessary high-voltage
          potential is stored on the capacitor in incremental, additive
          steps from the bridge-type rectifier 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the energy source is a
          direct-current electric energy storage device, such as the
          battery 12, the input to the bridge rectifier is provided by
          the voltage step-up transformer 22, that is in turn energized
          from the vibrator 20, or solid-state chopper, or similar
          device to properly drive the transformer and rectifier
          circuits.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the energy source is an
          alternating-current, switches 64 disconnect transformer 22 and
          the input to the bridge-type rectifier 24 is provided by the
          voltage step-up transformer 66, that is in turn energized from
          the vibrator 20, or solid-state chopper, or similar device to
          properly drive the transformer and rectifier circuits.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The repetitions output of
          the bridge rectifier incrementally increases the capacitor
          charge toward its maximum. This charge is electrically
          connected directly to the high-voltage anode 12 of the
          conversion switching element tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the low-voltage anode
          32 is connected to a source of current, an arc is created in
          the spark-gap designated 62 of the conversion switching
          element tube equivalent to the potential stored on the
          high-voltage anode, and the current available from the
          low-voltage anode. Because the duration of the arc is very
          short, the instantaneous voltage, and instantaneous current
          may both be very high. The instantaneous peak apparent power
          is therefore, also very high. Within the conversion switching
          element tube, this energy is absorbed by the grids 34a and 34b
          mounted circumferentially about the interior of the tube.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Control of the energy spike
          within the conversion switching element tube is accomplished
          by a mechanical, or solid-state commutator, that closes the
          circuit path from the low-voltage anode to the current source
          at that moment when the delivery of energy to the output load
          is most auspicious. Any number of standard high-accuracy,
          variable setting devices are available for this purpose. When
          control of the repetitive rate of the system's output is
          required, it is accomplished by controlling the time of
          connection at the low-voltage anode.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus there can be provided
          an electrical driving system having a low-voltage source
          coupled to a vibrator, a transformer and a bridge-type
          rectifier to provide a high voltage pulsating signal to a
          first capacitor. Where a high-voltage source is otherwise
          available, it may be coupled direct to a bridge-type
          rectifier, causing a pulsating signal to a first capacitor.
          The capacitor in turn is coupled to a high-voltage anode of an
          electrical conversion switching element tube. The element also
          includes a low-voltage anode which in turn is connected to a
          voltage source by a commutator, a switching element tube, and
          a variable resistor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mounted around the
          high-voltage anode is a charge receiving plate which in turn
          is coupled to an inductive load to transmit a high-voltage
          discharge from the element to the load. Also coupled to the
          load is a second capacitor for storing the back EMF created by
          the collapsing electrical field of the load when the current
          to the load is blocked. The second capacitor in turn is

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Disclosed is an electrical
          driving and recovery system for a high frequency environment.
          The recovery system can be applied to drive present day
          direct-current or alternating-current loads for better
          efficiency. It has a low-voltage source coupled to a vibrator,
          a transformer and a bridge-type rectifier to provide a high
          voltage pulsating signal to a first capacitor. Where a
          high-voltage source is otherwise available, it may be coupled
          directly to a bridge-type rectifier, causing a pulsating
          signal to the first capacitor. The first capacitor in turn is
          coupled to a high voltage anode of an electrical conversion
          switching element tube. The switching element tube also
          includes a low voltage anode which is connected to a voltage
          source by a commutator and a switching element tube. Mounted
          around the high voltage anode is a charge receiving plate
          which is coupled to an inductive load to transmit a high
          voltage discharge from the switching element tube to the load.
          Also coupled to the load is a second capacitor for storing the
          back EMF created by the collapsing electrical field of the
          load when the current to the load is blocked. The second
          capacitor is coupled to the voltage source. When adapted to
          present day direct-current or alternating-current devices the
          load could be a battery or capacitor to enhance the
          productivity of electrical energy.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description of the
            Preferred Embodiment ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the present invention
          is susceptible of various modifications and alternative
          constructions, an embodiment is shown in the drawings and will
          herein be described in detail. It should be understood however
          that it is not the intention to limit the invention to the
          particular form disclosed; but, on the contrary, the invention
          is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternative
          constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the
          invention as expressed in the appended claims.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is disclosed herein an
          electrical driving system which, on theory, will convert low
          voltage electric energy from a source such as an electric
          storage battery to a high potential, high current energy pulse
          that is capable of developing a working force at the inductive
          output of the device that is more efficient than that which is
          capable of being developed directly from the energy source.
          The improvement in efficiency is further enhanced by the
          capability of the device to return that portion of the initial
          energy developed, and not used by the inductive load in the
          production of mechanical energy, to the same or second energy
          reservoir or source for use elsewhere, or for storage.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This system accomplishes the
          results stated above by harnessing the "electrostatic" or
          "impulse" energy created by a high-intensity spark generated
          within a specially constructed electrical conversion switching
          element tube. This element utilizes a low-voltage anode, a
          high-voltage anode, and one or more "electrostatic" or charge
          receiving grids. These grids are of a physical size, and
          appropriately positioned, as to be compatible with the size of
          the tube, and therefore, directly related to the amount of
          energy to be anticipated when the device is operating.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The low-voltage anode may
          incorporate a resistive device to aid in controlling the
          amount of current drawn from the energy source. This
          low-voltage anode is connected to the energy source through a
          mechanical commutator or a solid-state pulser that controls
          the timing and duration of the energy spark within the
          element. The high-voltage anode is connected to a high-voltage
          potential developed by the associated circuits. An energy
          discharge occurs within the element when the external control
          circuits permit. This short duration, high-voltage,
          high-current energy pulse is captured by the "electrostatic"
          grids within the tube, stored momentarily, then transferred to
          the inductive output load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The increase in efficiency
          anticipated in converting the electrical energy to mechanical
          energy within the inductive load is attributed to the
          utilization of the most optimum timing in introducing the
          electrical energy to the load device, for the optimum period
          of time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further enhancement of
          energy conservation is accomplished by capturing a significant
          portion of the energy generated by the inductive load when the
          useful energy field is collapsing. This energy is normally
          dissipated in load losses that are contrary to the desired
          energy utilization, and have heretofore been accepted because
          no suitable means had been developed to harness this energy
          and restore it to a suitable energy storage device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention is
          concerned with two concepts or characteristics. The first of
          these characteristics is observed with the introduction of an
          energizing current through the inductor. The inductor creates
          a contrary force (counter-electromotive force or CEMF) that
          opposes the energy introduced into the inductor. This CEMF
          increases throughout the time the introduced energy is
          increasing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In normal applications of an
          alternating-current to an inductive load for mechanical
          applications, the useful work of the inductor is accomplished
          prior to terminating the application of energy. The excess
          energy applied is thereby wasted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Previous attempts to provide
          energy inputs to an inductor of time durations limited to that
          period when the optimum transfer of inductive energy to
          mechanical energy is occurring, have been limited by the
          ability of any such device to handle the high current required
          to optimize the energy transfer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second characteristic is
          observed when the energizing current is removed from the
          inductor. As the current is decreased, the inductor generates
          an EMF that opposes the removal of current or, in other words,
          produces an energy source at the output of the inductor that
          simulates the original energy source, reduced by the actual
          energy removed from the circuit by the mechanical load. This
          "regenerated", or excess, energy has previously been lost due
          to a failure to provide a storage capability for this energy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this invention, a
          high-voltage, high-current, short duration energy pulse is
          applied to the inductive load by the conversion element. This
          element makes possible the use of certain of that energy
          impressed within an arc across a spark-gap, without the
          resultant deterioration of circuit elements normally
          associated with high energy electrical arcs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention also provides
          for capture of a certain portion of the energy induced by the
          high inductive kick produced by the abrupt withdrawal of the
          introduced current. This abrupt withdrawal of current is
          attendant upon the termination of the stimulating arc. The
          voltage spike so created is imposed upon a capacitor that
          couples the attendant current to a secondary energy storage
          device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A novel, but not essential,
          circuit arrangement provides for switching the energy source
          and the energy storage device. This switching may be so
          arranged as to actuate automatically at predetermined times.
          The switching may be at specified periods determined by
          experimentation with a particular device, or may be actuated
          by some control device that measures the relative energy
          content of the two energy reservoirs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figure 1,
          the system 10 will be described in additional detail. The
          potential for the high-voltage anode 12 of the conversion
          element 14 is developed across the capacitor 16. This voltage
          is produced by drawing a low current from a battery source 18
          through the vibrator 20. The effect of the vibrator is to
          create a pulsating input to the transformer 22. The turns
          ratio of the transformer is chosen to optimize the voltage
          applied to a bridge-type rectifier 24. The output of the
          rectifier is then a series of high-voltage pulses of modest
          current. When the available source is already of the high
          voltage AC type, it may be coupled directly to the bridge-type
          rectifier.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By repetitious application
          of these output pulses from the bridge-type rectifier to the
          capacitor 16, a high-voltage high-level charge is built up on
          the capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Control of the conversion
          switching element tube is maintained by a commutator 26. A
          series of contacts mounted radially about a shaft, or a
          solid-state switching device sensitive to time or other
          variable may be used for this control element. A switching
          element tube type one-way energy path 28 is introduced between
          the commutator device and the conversion switching element
          tube to prevent high energy arcing at the commutator current
          path. When the switching element tube is closed, current from
          the voltage source 18 is routed through a resistive element 30
          and a low voltage anode 32. This causes a high energy
          discharge between the anodes within the conversion switching
          element tube 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The energy content of the
          high energy pulse is electrostatically coupled to the
          conversion grids 34 of the conversion element. This
          electrostatic charge is applied through an output terminal 60
          (Figure 2) across the load inductance 36, inducing a strong
          electromagnetic field about the inductive load. The intensity
          of this electromagnetic field is determined by the high
          electromotive potential developed upon the electrostatic grids
          and the very short time duration required to develop the
          energy pulse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the inductive load is
          coupled magnetically to a mechanical load, a strong initial
          torque is developed that may be efficiently utilized to
          produce physical work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Upon cessation of the energy
          pulse (arc) within the conversion switching element tube the
          inductive load is decoupled, allowing the electromagnetic
          field about the inductive load to collapse. The collapse of
          this energy field induces within the inductive load a counter
          EMF. This counter EMF creates a high positive potential across
          a second capacitor 38 which, in turn, is induced into the
          second energy storage device or battery 40 as a charging
          current. The amount of charging current available to the
          battery 40 is dependent upon the initial conditions within the
          circuit at the time of discharge within the conversion
          switching element tube and the amount of mechanical energy
          consumed by the work load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A spark-gap protection
          device 42 is included in the circuit to protect the inductive

          predetermined values, fixed by the mechanical size and spacing
          of the elements within the protective device, the excess
          energy is dissipated (bypassed) by the protective device to
          the circuit common (electrical ground).</font> </p>

          source and the retrieval unit at optimum intervals to be
          determined by the utilization of the conversion switching

          is well within the capabilities of intensive research and
          development technique.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let it be stated here that
          substituting a source of electric alternating-current subject
          to the required current and/or voltage shaping and/or timing,
          either prior to being considered a primary energy source, or
          thereafter, should not be construed to change the described
          utilization or application of primary energy in any way. Such
          energy conversion is readily achieved by any of a multitude of
          well established principles. The preferred embodiment of this
          invention merely assumes optimum utilization and optimum
          benefit from this invention when used with portable energy
          devices similar in principle to the wet-cell or dry-cell
          battery.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention proposes to
          utilize the energy contained in an internally generated
          high-voltage electric spike (energy pulse) to electrically
          energize an inductive load; this inductive load being then
          capable of converting the energy so supplied into a useful
          electrical or mechanical output. In operation the
          high-voltage, short-duration electric spike is generated by
          discharging the capacitor 16 across the spark-gap in the
          conversion switching element tube. The necessary high-voltage
          potential is stored on the capacitor in incremental, additive
          steps from the bridge-type rectifier 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the energy source is a
          direct-current electric energy storage device, such as the
          battery 12, the input to the bridge rectifier is provided by
          the voltage step-up transformer 22, that is in turn energized
          from the vibrator 20, or solid-state chopper, or similar
          device to properly drive the transformer and rectifier

          the vibrator 20, or solid-state chopper, or similar device to
          properly drive the transformer and rectifier circuits.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The repetitious output of
          the bridge rectifier incrementally increases the capacitor
          charge toward its maximum. This charge is electrically
          connected directly to the high-voltage anode 12 of the
          conversion switching element tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the low-voltage anode
          32 is connected to a source of current, an arc is created in
          the spark-gap designated 62 of the conversion switching
          element tube equivalent to the potential stored on the
          high-voltage anode, and the current available from the
          low-voltage anode. Because the duration of the arc is very
          short, the instantaneous voltage, and instantaneous current
          may both be very high. The instantaneous peak apparent power
          is therefore, also very high. Within the conversion switching
          element tube, this energy is absorbed by the grids 34a and 34b
          mounted circumferentially about the interior of the tube.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Control of the energy spike
          within the conversion switching element tube is accomplished
          by a mechanical, or solid-state commutator, that closes the
          circuit path from the low-voltage anode to the current source
          at that moment when the delivery of energy to the output load
          is most auspicious. Any number of standard high-accuracy,
          variable setting devices are available for this purpose. When
          control of the repetitive rate of the system's output is
          required, it is accomplished by controlling the time of
          connection at the low-voltage anode.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus there can be provided
          an electrical driving system having a low-voltage source
          coupled to a vibrator, a transformer and a bridge-type
          rectifier to provide a high voltage pulsating signal to a
          first capacitor. Where a high-voltage source is otherwise
          available, it may be coupled direct to a bridge-type
          rectifier, causing a pulsating signal to a first capacitor.
          The capacitor in turn is coupled to a high-voltage anode of an
          electrical conversion switching element tube. The element also
          includes a low-voltage anode which in turn is connected to a

          load is a second capacitor for storing the back EMF created by
          the collapsing electrical field of the load when the current

      <p>Back emf can result in energy loss, or inefficient use of
        energy, in inductive circuits. A&nbsp; regenerative energy
        recovery system, embodying the present invention employs
        switching 6 to discharge a capacitor 3, through an inductive
        load 5, e.g., a motor. When capacitor 3 is discharged, a diode 4
        creates an alternative circuit path through which inductively
        maintained current may then continue to flow, for example to
        charge a battery 7. The invention may be of particular value in
        electromagnetic propulsion systems. </p>
      <p><b>Specification</b> </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The inventor believes this to be a unique and novel approach to
        the control of electrical energy for possible future application
        for the propulsion of inductive devices. </p>
      <p>Through the use of certain inductive devices which enables the
        device to hold for a short period of time discharges of the
        capacitors to an external inductive load, the back EMF produced
        is captured and stored for future use. The result, then being,
        that the inventor believes this to be a more efficient use of
        energy. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to the Regenerative Energy Recovery
        System designed into a configuration wherein energy is
        momentarily stored for subsequent release for use in propelling
        electromagnetic devices. </p>
      <p>The Regenerative Energy Recovery System is designed to accept a
        high potential charge from a capacitor which has been charged
        from a high voltage power source. When the magnitude has been
        attained at a high level, this will cause a high current spike
        which can then be utilized into the inductive load. A part of
        the EMF, that is normally lost, is recaptured and rerouted and
        stored for future use. </p>
      <p>According to the preferred embodiment of this invention is an
        energy conserving system. Exemplary embodiments of the invention
        are herein illustrated. These exemplary illustrations and

      <p><b>Brief Description of Drawings</b> </p>
      <p>During phase A, a capacitor (item 3) is charged to a high
        voltage of about 2000 volts. Battery No. 1, shown as 24 V (item
        1) has its voltage charged to 2000 volts by the use of DC to DC
        converter (item 2). Item 1 is shown as a battery because that is
        usually a portable electrical energy source. Item 2 is any means
        suitable to change a low voltage to a high voltage. The phase A
        purpose is to obtain a high voltage change in a suitable
        capacitor. </p>
      <p>During phase B, the capacitor (item 3) charged to a high
        voltage is discharged by closing the normally open (N.O.) switch
        (item 6). The switch control (item 8) programs when the switches
        (items 4 and 6) are operated. The discharge current is rapidly
        p[assed through switch number 1 (item 4), through the inductive
        load (item 5) and through the now closed switch number 2 (item
        6), and through the energy recovery battery number 2 (item 7).
        Phase B continues until the capacitor approaches zero voltage
        whereupon the inertia of the current in the inductance of the
        inductive load would normally start an overshoot of reversed
        charge into the capacitor. </p>
      <p>During phase C, the switch number 1 (item 4) disconnects
        capacitor 9item 3) without interrupting the current flowing in
        the path described in phase B. That is, the current path is
        through items 5, 6, 7, and back through item 4 into the
        inductive load (item 5) in a closed loop. </p>
      <p>Switches, items 4 and 6 are any devices which will perform the
        desired switching function in the corresponding parts of the
        circuit. </p>
      <p>Inductive loads (item 5) may be a single load, or multiple
        loads, If a single load, the circuit may be duplicated so two
        inductive loads can interact in an inductive configuration. </p>
      <p>If a single load, a permanent magnetic field may also be used
        so two interacting magnetic fields can cause force and motion.
        If multiple loads, one may be designated a rotor load. Suitable
        polarities will determine whether attractive or repulsive
        interaction will occur. The timing of the discharge will occur
        at the instant the loads are properly positioned. The timing of
        discharge will be determined by the switch control. </p>
