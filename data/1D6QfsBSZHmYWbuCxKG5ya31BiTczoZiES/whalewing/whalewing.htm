            Corp., holds a prototype of the company's blade, which
            mimics the aerodynamically efficient design of a humpback
            whale's fin.</i> </p>

        <center><b>Humpback flipper may be the key to better wind
            turbines.</b></center>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>A local company has designed a new type of
        wind-turbine blade that mimics the aerodynamic performance of a
        humpback whale's flipper, allowing a turbine to capture more of
        the wind's energy at much lower speeds.
        <p>The odd-looking blades, which have teeth-like bumps along
          their leading edge, are a dramatic departure from the smooth
          and sleek design that graces most wind turbines. </p>
        <p>But Stephen Dewar, co-founder of Toronto-based WhalePower
          Corp., says the new approach could have a profound impact on
          wind-energy economics. </p>
        <p>It means turbines manufactured with WhalePower blades would
          be capable of capturing energy where the wind is less strong,
          as conventional turbines tend to stall when wind speeds fall
          too low. Not only would this improve the business case for
          individual wind farms, it broadens the natural geography
          suitable for large-scale wind generation. </p>
        <p>"This changes the game," says Dewar, adding that any system
          using a fan or turbine could also benefit from the new design.
          This includes everything from better turbines for
          hydroelectric generation to residential ceiling fans that use
          less electricity. "If we've got what we think we've got, then
          the range of applications is staggering." </p>
        <p>The potential was enough for the Ontario Centres of
          Excellence and the Ontario Power Authority to contribute about
          $70,000 in early-stage research funding, and to encourage
          collaboration with the wind-engineering group at the
          University of Western Ontario. Independent third-party
          verification of the new blade's performance will be a crucial
          step toward commercial production. </p>
        <p>"It's high risk, high return," says Ben Greenhouse, a manager
          of business development at OCE. "The business models will
          depend on how well this works." </p>
        <p>Marine scientists have long marvelled at the acrobatics and
          agility of humpback whales, given these monster swimmers can
          reach 16 metres in length and weigh as much as 13 Hummer SUVs.
          Despite their enormous size, humpbacks are efficient hunters
          able to make sharp, tight turns. </p>
        <p>It turns out the key to a humpback's agility lies in its long
          flippers, which feature a unique row of bumps or "tubercles"
          along their leading edge that give the wing-like appendages a
          serrated look. Researchers such as Frank Fish, a professor of
          biology at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, have found
          that the tubercles dramatically increase the whale's
          aerodynamic efficiency. </p>
        <p>In one particular study conducted inside a controlled wind
          tunnel, Fish and research colleagues at Duke University and
          the U.S. Naval Academy saw 32 per cent lower drag and an 8 per
          cent improvement in lift from a flipper with tubercles
          compared to a smooth flipper found on other whales. </p>
        <p>They also discovered that the angle of attack of the
          bump-lined flipper could be 40 per cent steeper than a smooth
          flipper before reaching "stall" that is, before seeing a
          dramatic loss in lift and increase in drag. In an airplane
          scenario, that's typically when you lose control and crash. </p>
        <p>"That stall typically occurs on most wings at 11 or 12
          degrees at the angle of attack," says Fish, adding that with
          the humpback design "stall occurred much later, at about 17 or
          18 degrees of attack. So the stall is being delayed." </p>
        <p>The implications are potentially enormous. Delayed stall on
          airplane wings can improve safety and make planes much more
          manoeuvrable and fuel-efficient. The same benefits can also be
          found on ship and submarine rudders, which explains the U.S.
          Navy's quiet involvement. </p>
        <p>Dewar, a former broadcast journalist and co-producer of the
          1980s nature series <i>Lorne Greene's New Wilderness</i>, is
          also a self-taught student of science with a fascination for
          linear and non-linear physics. He'd heard about Fish's
          research and, after a few chats over the phone, raised the
          idea of using the humpback design for wind turbines. </p>
        <p>"I saw it as a natural application of this technology,"
          recalls Fish. </p>
        <p>One thing led to another and the duo formed WhalePower, with
          Fish taking on the role of president and Dewar handling
          business development and R&amp;D from a headquarters in
          Toronto. Laurens Howle, Fish's research partner from Duke
          University, is an adviser and shareholder in the company who
          has contributed software for designing the new blades. </p>
        <p>"We have an international patent going through everywhere,"
          says Dewar. "It applies to all forms of turbines, compressors,
          pumps and fans." </p>
        <p>WhalePower can retrofit blades on existing turbines or build
          new blades from scratch. Dewar says prototype tests to date
          have demonstrated "outstanding performance," most importantly
          during light winds, with the tubercle-lined blades capable of
          more than doubling performance at wind speeds of 8 metres per
          second. </p>
        <p>"In fact, we're getting the kind of power (regular blades)
          produce at 8 metres per second at 5 metres per second," says
          Dewar, describing the results as "spooky" because of the
          dramatic improvement. </p>
        <p>Fish says the better performance at low speeds is what makes
          the design stand out. "Since there are probably more days when
          you don't have gusty winds but instead have lower wind speeds,
          that means you can generate electricity on those lower energy
          days." </p>
        <p>The reason is because the tubercles channel the wind as it
          hits the front or "leading" edge of the blade. The channels
          cause separate wind streams to accelerate across the surface
          of the blade in organized, rotating flows. These energy-packed
          vortexes seem to increase the lift force on the blade. </p>
        <p>As well, the channels prevent airflow from moving along the
          span of the blade and past its tip, a troubling situation on
          smooth blades that can cause noise, instability and lead to a
          loss of energy. By keeping the airflow channelled, more of the
          wind is captured and noise is greatly reduced. </p>
        <p>Dewar says the same aerodynamic principle applies to water
          flow through hydroelectric turbines â€“ in other words, more
          electricity can be generated at lower water speeds, making it
          possible, particularly in a water-rich province like Ontario,
          to reconsider hydroelectric or pump-storage sites previously
          thought uneconomic for power generation. </p>
        <p>"I'm honestly scared of making claims at this point," says
          Dewar. "The results are so good that we know everybody who
          knows anything about aerodynamics will think we're salting the
          goldmine." That's why third-party verification will be
          essential. The research, he says, has to be "bullet proof." </p>
        <p>But even if WhalePower can prove beyond a doubt that its
          blade design is better, it doesn't necessarily ensure success.
          Wind-turbine manufacturers can't keep up with demand for
          current product, so there's little incentive to dramatically
          alter the design of their blades â€“ at least not yet. There's
          also no incentive for banks to lend money to wind-farm
          projects taking a risk on a new blade design. </p>
        <p>"It's like trying to break into the semiconductor business,"
          says Kerry Adler, chief executive of Toronto-based wind
          developer SkyPower Corp. </p>
        <p>"You're going to be hard-pressed to convince Dell Computer to
          put a new processing chip on their motherboards, particularly
          if it's not proven. In the wind industry, you'll have to have
          a thousand turbines in the ground before anybody gives (a
          technology) a second look." </p>
        <p>WhalePower's hope of retrofitting existing turbine blades â€“
          an estimated $50 billion worth around the world â€“ could also
          prove a tough sell. Adler says retrofitting a blade with
          tubercles would void the warranty. "Who's going to take that
          chance?" </p>
        <p>Fish appreciates that WhalePower's approach may be considered
          radical, and he understands that many wind-turbine
          manufacturers will operate on the premise: If it isn't broken,
          don't fix it. But he says any business will change its course
          if the economic benefits are compelling enough. </p>
        <p>"It takes a while to get any sort of new technology into the
          marketplace," says Fish, at the same time convinced that the
          study of biomimicry â€“ the melding of biology and engineering
          â€“ will help shape the future of energy production,
          transportation and medicine. </p>
        <p>"We're starting to see more and more engineers grabbing on to
          this."</p>

        Cetacean Research and Conservation </p>
      <p>DURHAM, N.C. -- Wind tunnel tests of scale-model humpback whale
        flippers have revealed that the scalloped, bumpy flipper is a
        more efficient wing design than is currently used by the
        aeronautics industry on airplanes. The tests show that
        bump-ridged flippers do not stall as quickly and produce more
        lift and less drag than comparably sized sleek flippers. </p>
      <p>The tests were reported by biomechanicist Frank Fish of West
        Chester University, Pa., fluid dynamics engineer Laurens Howle
        of the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and David
        Miklosovic and Mark Murray at the U.S. Naval Academy. They
        reported their findings in the May 2004 issue of Physics of
        Fluids, published in advance online on March 15, 2004.&nbsp; <a
href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHFLE6000016000005000L39000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes"

      </p>
      <p>In their study, the team first created two approximately
        22-inch-tall scale models of humpback pectoral flippers -- one
        with the characteristic bumps, called tubercles, and one
        without. The models were machined from thick, clear
        polycarbonate at Duke University. Testing was conducted in a low
        speed closed-circuit wind tunnel at the U.S. Naval Academy in
        Annapolis, Md. </p>
      <p>The sleek flipper performance was similar to a typical airplane
        wing. But the tubercle flipper exhibited nearly 8 percent better
        lift properties, and withstood stall at a 40 percent steeper
        wind angle. The team was particularly surprised to discover that
        the flipper with tubercles produced as much as 32 percent lower
        drag than the sleek flipper. </p>
      <p>“The simultaneous achievement of increased lift and reduced
        drag results in an increase in aerodynamic efficiency,” Howle
        explains. </p>
      <p>This new understanding of humpback whale flipper aerodynamics
        has implications for airplane wing and underwater vehicle
        design. Increased lift (the upward force on an airplane wing) at
        higher wind angles affects how easily airplanes take off, and
        helps pilots slow down during landing. </p>
      <p>Improved resistance to stall would add a new margin of safety
        to aircraft flight and also make planes more maneuverable. Drag
        -- the rearward force on an airplane wing -- affects how much
        fuel the airplane must consume during flight. Stall occurs when
        the air no longer flows smoothly over the top of the wing but
        separates from the top of the wing before reaching the trailing
        edge. When an airplane wing stalls, it dramatically loses lift
        while incurring an increase in drag. </p>
      <p>As whales move through the water, the tubercles disrupt the
        line of pressure against the leading edge of the flippers. The
        row of tubercles sheer the flow of water and redirect it into
        the scalloped valley between each tubercle, causing swirling
        vortices that roll up and over the flipper to actually enhance
        lift properties. </p>
      <p>“The swirling vortices inject momentum into the flow,” said
        Howle. “This injection of momentum keeps the flow attached to
        the upper surface of the wing and delays stall to higher wind
        angles.” </p>
      <p>“This discovery has potential applications not only to airplane
        wings but also on the tips of helicopter rotors, airplane
        propellers and ship rudders,” said Howle. </p>
      <p>The purpose of the tubercles on the leading edge of humpback
        whale flippers has been the source of speculation for some time,
        said Fish. “The idea they improved flipper aerodynamics was so
        counter to our current doctrine of fluid dynamics, no one had
        ever analyzed them,” he said. </p>
      <p>Humpback whales maneuver in the water with surprising agility
        for 44-foot animals, particularly when they are hunting for
        food. By exhaling air underwater as they turn in a circle, the
        whales create a cylindrical wall of bubbles that herd small fish
        inside. Then they barrel up through the middle of the “bubble
        net,” mouth open wide, to scoop up their prey. </p>
      <p>According to Fish, the scalloped hammerhead shark is the only
        other marine animal with a similar aerodynamic design. The
        expanded hammerhead shark head may act like a wing. </p>
      <p>The trick now is to figure out how to incorporate the advantage
        of the tubercle flipper into manmade designs, said Fish. </p>
      <p>The research team now plans to perform a systematic engineering
        investigation of the role of scalloped leading edges on lift
        increase, drag reduction and stall delay. </p>
