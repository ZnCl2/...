      <br>
      Part of the research group at Laboratory of Organic Electronics:
      Jesper Edberg, Isak Engquist and Xavier Crispin.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Linköping University’s Laboratory of Organic
      Electronics, Sweden, have developed power paper – a new material
      with an outstanding ability to store energy. The material consists
      of nanocellulose and a conductive polymer. The results have been
      published in Advanced Science.<br>
      <br>
      EnergipappretOne sheet, 15 centimetres in diameter and a few
      tenths of a millimetre thick can store as much as 1 F, which is
      similar to the supercapacitors currently on the market. The
      material can be recharged hundreds of times and each charge only
      takes a few seconds.<br>
      <br>
      It’s a dream product in a world where the increased use of
      renewable energy requires new methods for energy storage – from
      summer to winter, from a windy day to a calm one, from a sunny day
      to one with heavy cloud cover.<br>
      <br>
      ”Thin films that function as capacitors have existed for some
      time. What we have done is to produce the material in three
      dimensions. We can produce thick sheets,” says Xavier Crispin,
      professor of organic electronics and co-author to the article just
      published in Advanced Science.<br>
      <br>
      Other co-authors are researchers from KTH Royal Institute of
      Technology, Innventia, Technical University of Denmark and the
      University of Kentucky.<br>
      <br>
      The material, power paper, looks and feels like a slightly
      plasticky paper and the researchers have amused themselves by
      using one piece to make an origami swan – which gives an
      indication of its strength.<br>
      <br>
      The structural foundation of the material is nanocellulose, which
      is cellulose fibres which, using high-pressure water, are broken
      down into fibres as thin as 20 nm in diameter. With the cellulose
      fibres in a solution of water, an electrically charged polymer
      (PEDOT:PSS), also in a water solution, is added. The polymer then
      forms a thin coating around the fibres.<br>
      <br>
      ”The covered fibres are in tangles, where the liquid in the spaces
      between them functions as an electrolyte,” explains Jesper Edberg,
      doctoral student, who conducted the experiments together with
      Abdellah Malti, who recently completed his doctorate.<br>
      <br>
      The new cellulose-polymer material has set a new world record in
      simultaneous conductivity for ions and electrons, which explains
      its exceptional capacity for energy storage. It also opens the
      door to continued development toward even higher capacity. Unlike
      the batteries and capacitors currently on the market, power paper
      is produced from simple materials – renewable cellulose and an
      easily available polymer. It is light in weight, it requires no
      dangerous chemicals or heavy metals and it is waterproof.<br>
      <br>
      The Power Papers project has been financed by the Knut and Alice
      Wallenberg Foundation since 2012.<br>
      <br>
      ”They leave us to our research, without demanding lengthy reports,
      and they trust us. We have a lot of pressure on us to deliver, but
      it’s ok if it takes time, and we’re grateful for that,” says
      Professor Magnus Berggren, director of the Laboratory of Organic
      Electronics at Linköping University.<br>
      <br>
      The new power paper is just like regular pulp, which has to be
      dehydrated when making paper. The challenge is to develop an
      industrial-scale process for this.<br>
      <br>
      ”Together with KTH, Acreo and Innventia we just received SEK 34
      million from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research to
      continue our efforts to develop a rational production method, a
      paper machine for power paper,” says Professor Berggren.<br>
      <br>

      Highest charge and capacitance in organic electronics, 1 C and 2 F
      (Coulomb and Farad).<br>

      A mixed ionic–electronic conductor based on nanofibrillated
      cellulose composited with
      poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythio­phene):­poly(styrene-sulfonate) along
      with high boiling point solvents is demonstrated in bulky
      electrochemical devices. The high electronic and ionic
      conductivities of the resulting nanopaper are exploited in devices
      which exhibit record values for the charge storage capacitance
      (1F) in supercapacitors and transconductance (1S) in
      electrochemical transistors. <br>

      The invention discloses a graphene oxide reinforced composite
      carbon nanopaper and a production method thereof. The above carbon
      paper includes: a carbon nanotube substrate including a skeleton
      network mainly formed by carbon nanotubes; and at least an
      enhanced network for connecting the carbon nanotubes in the
      skeleton network, wherein the enhanced network is mainly formed by
      graphene oxide dispersed in the skeleton network. The production
      method comprises the following steps: uniformly mixing a carbon
      nanotube dispersion with a graphite oxide graphene dispersion
      filtering to form a film, and peeling the formed film from a
      substrate filter film in order to obtain a target product. The
      composite carbon nanopaper has greatly improved mechanical
      properties, has no apparent loss of the excellent electrical
      conductivity or thermal conductivity, fully solves the problem of
      poor mechanical strength of present carbon tube nanopaper, and has
      the characteristics of electrical conduction, thermal conduction,
      light weight, flexibility and high efficiency. The production
      method has the advantages of simplicity, easy operation, good
      controllability, low cost and wide application prospect.<br>

      A scalable, energy efficient process for preparing cellulose
      nanofibers is disclosed. The process employs treating the
      cellulosic material with a first mechanical refiner with plates
      having a configuration of blades separated by grooves, and
      subsequently treating the material with a second mechanical
      refiner with plates having a configuration of blades separated by
      grooves different than the first refiner. The plate configurations
      and treatment operations are selected such that the first refiner
      produces a first SEL that is greater than the SEL of the second
      refiner, by as much as 2-50 fold. An exemplary high first SEL may
      be in the range of 1.5 to 8 J/m. Paper products made with about 2%
      to about 30% cellulose nanofibers having a length from about 0.2
      mm to about 0.5 mm, preferably from 0.2 mm to about 0.4 mm have
      improved properties.<br>

      In a method for preparing nanofibrillar cellulose, fibrous
      dispersion of ionically charged cellulose is repeatedly passed
      through a mechanical process of disrupting fibers into fibrils
      until the viscosity starts to decrease. The number average
      diameter of the nanofibrillar cellulose after the mechanical
      process is in the range of 2-10 nm, and the zero-shear viscosity
      is below 10 Pas, preferably below 1 Pas, when measured in the
      concentration of 0.5 wt-%. The nanofibrillated cellulose is low
      aspect ratio nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC-L).<br>

      Processes disclosed are capable of converting biomass into
      high-crystallinity nanocellulose with low mechanical energy input.
      In some variations, the process includes fractionating biomass
      with lignosulfonic acids, to generate cellulose-rich solids; and
      mechanically treating the cellulose-rich solids to form
      nanofibrils and/or nanocrystals. The strong lignosulfonic acids
      created during delignification give a pH less than 1 and hydrolyze
      preferentially the amorphous regions of cellulose. The total
      mechanical energy may be less than 500 kilowatt-hours per ton. The
      crystallinity of the nanocellulose material may be 80% or higher,
      translating into good reinforcing properties for composites. The
      nanocellulose material may include nanofibrillated cellulose,
      nanocrystalline cellulose, or both. In some embodiments, the
      nanocellulose material is hydrophobic via deposition of lignin
      onto the cellulose surface. Optionally, sugars derived from
      amorphous cellulose and hemicellulose may be separately fermented
      to co-products.<br>

      A process for obtaining nanofibrillated cellulose, starting from a
      raw material consisting of recycled or recovered paper, or
      recovered paper pulp or recovered cellulose, comprises immersing
      the raw material in an acetic acid solution, in a concentration of
      10% to 50% by volume, during a time inverse to the concentration
      of acetic acid, stirring the raw material immersed in the acetic
      acid solution, and subsequently subjecting the cellulosic material
      to a mechanical process of longitudinal separation of fibres, by
      shear forces applied through a mixer or similar equipment capable
      of creating enough shearing on cellulose pulp. The nanofibrillated
      cellulose obtained from recycled paper using this process has
