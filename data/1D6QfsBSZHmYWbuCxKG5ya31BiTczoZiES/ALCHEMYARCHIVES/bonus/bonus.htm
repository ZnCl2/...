      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work casts out cruel disease from the
        human body, disease produced by malignant humours; and thus you
        are preserved. It will teach you how to regain the beautiful
        flower of youth, and how to secure a green and placid old age.
        All this may be yours, by the favour of the gods. Poverty will
        be triumphantly put to flight; your treasure-house will be
        filled; you will be able to succour the needy, and to render the
        sacrifice of praise to great Jupiter. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, the Divine Art, having long suffered

        distress; but my suppliant hands were uplifted in vain. At last
        one of them was filled with compassion because of my moans and
        tears; Lacinius flung wide my prison doors, and set a lordly
        crown on my head. By the flashing light of genius, he shewed to
        all what glorious regards I had to bestow on my followers; and
        every reader may see what stores of wisdom and learning I

        which Raymond signified in so many books, the power of his
        genius focused in one small treatise. Worthy of the highest

      <center><b><i>Janus Lacinius, the Calabrian Minorite Friar (of
            Psychronea), to the Gentle Reader Sends Greetings.</i></b></center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The philosophers inform us that opposites
        belong to the same category, and therefore they throw light on
        each other by being brought into juxtaposition. The illustrious
        character of liberality and generosity only intensifies the
        disgrace of avarice and selfish greed. Those who know that life
        was bestowed on them for the sake of their friends and their
        country, whose years also are spent in the service of others,
        are worthy of the most distinguished honour. Those, on the other
        hand, who, by the pride of life and the greed of gain, are led
        to bury their talents, and to turn a def ear to the appeals of
        justice and humanity, while they avariciously and relentlessly
        pursue their own selfish pleasure, are such vile, abandoned, and
        harpy-like creatures that they are justly branded with the
        contempt and execration of mankind, The despicable avarice of
        those who, so far from doing any good with their money to
        others, do not even enjoy it themselves, by its hateful and
        repulsive want of social kindness sets off to the greatest
        advantage the overflowing generosity and liberality of opposite
        natures. Hence, after my return from Cisalpine Gaul to Padua, I
        was greatly attracted by a most lucid discourse of Bonus, a
        profound scholar of Ferrara, on the possibility and truth of the
        Alchemistic Art. Concerning this subject, he expressed himself
        with such profound, subtle, copious, and accurate learning that
        I cannot remember any obscure point which was not touched upon
        with unprecedented clearness and definiteness. This dissertation
        must be of the greatest utility, not only to ardent students of
        Alchemy, but even to its detractors. I should, therefore, be
        justly chargeable with meanness and illiberality if I refused to
        do all in my power to make it accessible to the general public.
        Such an accusation I should be loth indeed to incur, and I have,
        therefore, arranged for the publication of the aforesaid
        memorable discourse of Bonus of Ferrara, together with copious
        extracts from the works of Raymondus Lullius, Arnold of
        Villanova, Michael Scotus, Rhasis, Albertus, and other men of
        light and leading. In this synopsis you will find nothing that
        is not profound, excellent, and positively reliable. The Sages
        whom I have quoted possess so remarkable an insight into the
        nature of things, so abundant and incredible a store of
        learning, that solemn importance attaches to every word they
        utter; but it is my opinion that Bonus excels them all, and I am
        sure that the reader will agree with me when he sees the golden
        current of philosophy issue from his lips. He is more profound
        than all the rest in laying the foundation of his system, more
        subtle in his manner of expressing truth, more lucid in setting
        forth the secret working of Nature. It is my admiration for his
        genius that has induced me to describe is discourse as a Pearl
        of Great Price. The pearls which we find here are indeed
        precious, without an obscuring spot, but clear and without an
        obscuring spit, but clear and pure, utterly unlike the writing
        of those who only embarrass and bewilder the enquirer by their
        dark and hopelessly perplexing phraseology. Our Bonus sheds
        noonday brightness where they dispense only darkness as of
        Egypt: he shews to all students not only the truth and
        possibility, but the actual necessity of our Art. His utterances
        I have, with great industry, collected, elucidated, and
        expurgated, and here I present them to the student in an
        accessible form. Accept my gift with a joy proportioned to its
        worth; fold it close to your heart; thank God for it; read it
        diligently, day and night; and accept my best wishes that it may
        lead you onward to success. If this book be well received, I
        intend to follow it up with an explanatory synopsis of all the
        works of Raymondus Lullius. </p>

        <b><font size="+1">Nuncupatory Discourse,</font></b>
        <p><i>The Interlocutors Being Lacinius and Bonus, of Ferrara.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- It is both customary and
        right, O Lacinius, that those who have accomplished anything
        worth mentioning in any art or science should make known their
        discoveries to the world, in order that mankind at large may be
        benefited by them. This office I have not been able to perform
        for myself; but as you have collected and studied my works, I
        earnestly hope that you will not suffer them to remain covered
        with the dust of forgetfulness, but that you will send me forth,
        in company with Arnold, Raymond, and others, to deliver my
        message to mankind. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- I will gladly do what
        you ask. But there is a time-honoured custom amongst authors of
        dedicating their works to some Pope or Prince whose favour they
        wish to gain, or whose patronage they desire to acknowledge. To
        whom shall your book be dedicated? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- I am aware of the custom
        which you mention. Some adopt this device in order to save their
        work from the obscurity and neglect which they may have good
        reason to fear. Others, by placing the name of some illustrious
        person on the title-page, desire to safeguard themselves against
        the supercilious carelessness of critics, who at once throw
        aside any book of which the author is as yet unknown to fame.
        Thus, in dedicating their writings to great men, most authors
        are impelled by motives of self-interest, for they know very
        well that their patrons will probably never so much as look at
        their production. For much as look at their production. Or this
        and other reasons, I do not wish my book to be dedicated to
        either Pope or Prince. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- But are you not afraid
        of the insolence of the envious, the abuse of the greedy, the
        sneers of sciolists, the calumnies of merchants --- in short,
        the opposition of all who think that nobody is wise but
        themselves? Will not their enmity shroud you in Cimmerian
        darkness? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- It is the nature of curs to
        bark, and they will do so while they live, especially when they
        see any one better than themselves. I do not care what fools
        say, but only what honest men, and what truth itself, may utter.
      </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- But if I dedicate you to
        some illustrious Prince they will perhaps cease to bark. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- You to take too favourable
        a view of these men. If their mouths are filled with blasphemy
        against God, we cannot expect them to reverence anything. Do not
        let any hope of propitiating them change your purpose. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- But, perhaps, a patron
        might regard me for my labour, and thus enable me to live. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- So thought Aurelius
        Augurellus, who dedicated his work on gold-making to Pope Leo X,
        and received from that prelate, whose generosity was well-known,
        a gown of green silk, the colour of hope. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- He was right. For how
        could he give anything more costly to a man who professed to be
        an adept in the art of gold-making? Might I not at least shew my
        gratitude to some old and dear friends and benefactors by
        ascribing the work to them? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- By such a course you would
        be more likely to convert your fiends into enemies. Do you not
        know that all who practice this art are very anxious to keep it
        a secret from the whole world? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- Alas! Is it, then, a
        profane pursuit? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- That is the opinion of the
        vulgar. But the art is sacred, and all its adepts are sanctified
        and pure. For “men either discover it because they are holy, or
        it makes them holy”. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- That is not the opinion
        of the present age. People say that this art is unbecoming not
        only a godly but even an honest man. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- And do you also echo the
        ignorant babble of the vulgar? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- Would it were of the
        vulgar only! But I know that it is the opinion of all classes,
        both high and low, learned and ignorant. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- Can it be true? Surely they
        must be thinking of those sophistical impostors who are a
        disgrace to our science. Such men are not philosophers, but
        thieves and robbers: between us and them there is all the
        difference of day and night, good and evil, God and mammon. But,
        nevertheless, by their wickedness and shameless practices, they
        have succeeded in making our blessed Art a byword among the
        vulgar. Yet it is essentially an art which can never become
        known to any but honest and God-fearing persons. Was not the
        inventor of this Art, the thrice-great Hermes, a person of
        signal sanctity? Are there not among the professors of the great
        magistery holy divines like John of Damascus, Albertus Magnus,
        St. Thomas, Roger Bacon, Haymon, Raymond, Godfrey, John, the
        most reverend Bishop of Ticina, Cardinal Garsia, Friar Helyas,
        Friar William, Friar Richard, Peter of Iliacum, Morienus, and
        many other monks, nay, as Vincentus, the historian, tells us, St
        John the Evangelist himself? Of the latter it is said that when
        the two youths, who had given all their good to the poor for the
        sake of Christ, were heavy at heart because they saw their
        slaves arrayed in gorgeous robes, while they themselves were
        poorly clad, he bade them bring him bundles of rods and pebbles
        from the seashore, and changed them all into pure gold. This,
        however, I regard as miracle, rather than a proof of our Art,
        for the substance was too unlike that which we use, and "one
        action does not make an artist". But what shall I say of
        Raymond, whose life and genius are the admiration of all?
        Raymond was first opposed to this magistery, and attempted to
        convince Arnold de Villanova of its impossibility, but was
        himself overcome, not so much in argument as by the evidence of
        his senses. By this discomfiture, Raymond was induced to study
        the Art; and when his search was crowned with success, he became
        the foremost champion of Alchemy, writing 500 volumes in is
        defense. He was also the first to discover the method of
        evolving precious stones out of the metallic principles; nay, he
        was able, not only to change lead into gold, but he transmuted
        gold into lead, and thus turned back the course of Nature. It is
        also related of him that he performed the almost incredible task
        of transmuting a tiny bar of metal partly into gold, partly into
        silver, brass, tine, iron, and lead. Are these things of no
        account? Are they absurd or ridiculous? And is it no wicked and
        unworthy of a refined and cultivated mind the suppose that the
        knowledge and practice of our Art is unbecoming a religious and
        god-fearing man? If Paul wove tents, if Luke painted, and Peter
        and John pursued the calling of fishermen, honest and useful
        work cannot be unworthy the attention of a godly person. Surely,
        it is more religious to do something than to be idle! </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- Your argument is
        unanswerable, for you appeal to the practice of those whose
        words and deeds were the standard of truth, justice, faith,
        innocence, religion, and holiness for all mankind: as the sky is
        illumined with stars, so they were appointed as the lights of
        the world. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- Why, then, are you so
        fearful of launching our little book without any dedicatory
        inscription? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- I fear most that this
        book may make the matter too clear to the vulgar herd, thus
        bestowing God’s most precious earthly gift upon the wicked and
        undeserving, in defiance of the ancient precept. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- That rule was more
        applicable to men of old than to our present state of Christian
        liberty. Heathen Sages might be fearful of spreading this
        knowledge too commonly, but Christ has taught us the true use of
        riches --- to relieve the wants of the poor and needy. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- Why, then, do our
        masters follow in the footsteps of the ancients, and predict
        ruin to mankind from the profanation of this mystery. John de
        Rupicessa conjures his readers not to make the Art known to the
        wicked and unbelieving, as such a course would ruin the
        Christian faith. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- Do you imagine that the
        faith of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, can be overthrown by
        these means? Has it not always grown most rapidly, precisely
        where it has been most severely opposed? But Christ Himself has
        given us a sovereign rule for our guidance in this matter:
        "Freely ye have received, freely give". What is the use of
        concealed diamonds, or a hidden treasure, to the world? What is
        the use of a lighted candle if it be lighted under a bushel? It
        is the innate selfishness of the human heart which makes these
        persons seek a pious pretext for keeping this knowledge from
        mankind. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- I know some men who are
        so jealous of the preservation of this secret that they will
        hardly read their own books, and would not for all the world
        allow any one else to look at them, just as if they feared that
        the Stone would at once leap forth from the book, if it were
        only opened, and that it would soon lie about in every gutter.
        These persons are such skinflints withal that they would rather
        remain in ignorance than spend a single penny in search of the
        Stone. I suppose they expect the knowledge to be showered down
        upon them from heaven. Surely we have reason to pray that such
        people may be delivered from their own blinding meanness and
        illiberality. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- Would that a ray of Divine
        light might illumine the gross darkness of their understandings!
        But I am afraid that their folly is past praying for. If indeed
        they could be brought to see that this world is under Divine
        rule and governance, that no mortal can approach God but by God,
        that even the light cannot be perceived without light, they
        might come to understand that, without the special grace of God,
        this ineffable gift is not bestowed on any man. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- how can those harpies
        reply to that argument? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- They are in a state of
        frenzied ignorance, which prevents them from perceiving the
        difficulties of the task; and so the Stone which they find is
        the Stone of Sisyphus. For "they are few who Jupiter loves, or
        whom their manly perfection exalts to the stars". When, indeed,
        the Stone is found, our friends, who now laugh and sneer at us,
        will be at a loss how to express their love. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- Alas, that this glorious
        and heavenly magistery should be regarded by many as a mere
        fraud and imposture! </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- No wonder, if overweening
        and ignorant persons such as carpenters, weavers, smiths, take
        upon themselves to set up laboratories, and to pretend to a
        knowledge of our Art. The universal prevalence of impostors
        naturally makes people think that our whole Art is a fraud from
        beginning to end. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- But is this knowledge
        not also sought by learned men, nobles, princes, and even by
        kings? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus</i> --- Yes, but the motive which
        prompts them all is an illiberal love of gold. Their hearts are
        as hard as the flints which they wish to change into the
        precious metals, and they are as ignorant withal of the
        elementary facts of nature as the poorest laborer. The
        consequence is that they fall an easy prey to impostors and
        itinerant charlatans, and spend their lives in foolishly
        experimenting with <i>arsenic</i>, sulphur, and all manner of
        solvents. Thus, instead of learning to prepare the Stone, they
        dissipate their money, and have empty pockets for their pains. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacinius</i> --- It is a just reward for
        their folly; for what have those substances to do with metals? </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus </i>--- We will then send forth
        our little book, not protected with the name of any prince or
        noble, but equipped only with the strength of virtue and truth,
        after the manner of those Egyptian kings who dedicated all
        things to Mercury, the giver of virtue and genius, and to the
        Sun, the generator of all things. We will dedicate our book to
        Mercury and the Sun, and to all who love righteous and truth.
        But those wise people who do not approve of anything what they
        do not understand must listen to the book, and let it speak for
        itself. It is well for an author if he has no need to commend
        himself, because his book commends him. He were a vain workman
        who looked for praise and preferment from anything but the value
        of his work. Farewell. </p>

        <b><i><font size="+1">A Form and Method of Perfecting Base
              Metals,</font></i></b>
        <p><b><i>By Janus Lacinius Therapus,</i></b> <br>
          <b><i>The Calabrian.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b><i><font size="+1">The Art of Generating M or Q.</font></i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the principles of our Art are
        apprehended mentally or intellectually, such as Chaos,
        Alteration, Power, Operation, Generation, and Digestion. Others
        are perceived by the senses, as wine, or the First Matter, body
        or form, elements, the perfect being, the forming ferment,
        colours, fermentation, separation. Some are apprehended both by
        mind and sense, e.g., Sky, or Heaven. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.</b> --- From CHAOS goes forth an
        intelligent Master, who, amidst the rude, confused, and
        undigested mass of the elements, perceives himself advancing
        towards M or Q, until by B, C, D, and by the primordial
        elements, which follow from Nature herself, he arrives thither.
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.</b> --- The SUBSTANCE is that from
        which D arises when the Artificer works extrinsically. We also
        apply it. to the imperfect metals which are to be changed into M
        or Q. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.</b> --- The FORM is the intelligent
        outward influence (the Master), which, sets in motion. these
        Principles. It is that also which gives being to M or Q, and by
        which T, S, V, Z are changed into X or Y. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</b>. --- The Sky is the female
        principle, by which that which is received of the male is
        nourished and increased until it is wholly changed into M or Q.
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.</b> --- The ELEMENTS are changed from
        B into D, and by way of C, on the other hand, F, G, H, I, are
        intermingled. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F.</b> --- CONVERSION takes place, first
        of C into D, and then of D into C, finally of both in turn into
        M or Q. F also indicates the potency of which D is the Act, and
        through which pearls are made and generated artificially. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G</b>. --- PERMIXTION is the union of the
        male and the female principle (e.g., C with D). </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H</b>. --- DISSOLUTION is the
        hermaphroditic conception which takes place in either C or D. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>. --- GENERATION is partly that by
        which C and D produce M, and partly that by which M and D
        produce Q. If we place the Substance in a closed vessel, it is
        brought about by Nature rather than by the aid of art. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K</b>. --- Of COLOURS, the first is
        black, which is more difficult to bring about than the rest,
        from the fact that it is the first. It shews that C and D have
        united, and that conception has taken place, i.e. that M or Q
        will ultimately be produced. Then comes white, by which we
        gradually progress from C to M, and thence to Q; then saffron,
        which indicates that the conjunction of the substances is in
        progress, because the seed is diffused through the whole of D;
        the fourth colour is red, indicating the actual accomplishment
        of M or Q. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L</b>. --- DIGESTION is the gradual
        development of that which is conceived, by gentle outward heat,
        e.g., the evolution of M out of C and D, or of Q out of M and D.
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O</b>. --- SEPARATION is the severing of
        elements, which, originating from B and D, are also separated
        from the same. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P</b>. --- OPERATION is either the whole
        process of change by which B and the rest of the principles
        become M or Q, or the use of M and Q in transmuting base metals
        into silver or gold. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M</b>. --- The PERFECT BEING is the
        efficient cause, or the form of that into which C and D are
        changed by way of E, F, G, H, I, K, L, O, P, and has power to
        perfect imperfect metals. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N</b>. --- FERMENTATION is the wonderful
        principle by which M is developed into Q. It is brought about by
        the bland warmth of a gentle fire. Thus M is still wanting in
        some of the most potent properties of Q, which is the perfect
        Tincture. Q is capable of unlimited extension, not only
        quantitatively, but qualitatively. If you can change M into Q,
        you can multiply and perfect Q indefinitely. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q</b>. --- Then, is the formative
        tincture, consummately perfect, and consisting of the
        equilibrium of all the elements. Hence its virtue is far greater
        and more potent than that of M. It changes imperfect metals into
        silver or gold (X or Y), and it is an efficacious remedy for all
        mental and bodily disease in man, seeing that it expels all
        disturbing elements; it also makes and keeps men good and kindly
        disposed towards others. It is, finally, a sovereign cure of the
        weakness of old age. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix one part of gold (X) with twelve parts
        of Our Water; pound them small; place them in a moderately deep
        jar; set over it an alembic in the ordinary way; stop up the jar
        and the apertures of the alembic, up to the beak, with clay; let
        it dry thoroughly; place it on the oven (not immediately over
        the coals, but on the iron) in such a way that the whole jar
        shall be covered by it as far as the alembic, and let the
        aperture between jar and furnace be also sealed with clay. Then
        light the fire, and there will come oil into the alembic,
        together with the water, and will float on the water with an
        orange colour. Continue the fire till all the water is
        distilled; let it cool; remove the recipient; separate the oil
        from the water, and open the jar: you will find a hard, brittle,
        and pulverizable body. If you like, repeat the whole process,
        pouring the same or other water over the body; distil as before.
        The water that comes out will not be so much as at first, and if
        you repeat the process a third time, there will be hardly any
        water at all. The body that remains will be a blackish powder,
        which you calcine in the following way: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the body be one ounce, pour over it three
        ounces of Mercury, and pound them together, thus producing an
        amalgam like butter. Then place it in a glass vessel, and stop
        up the apertures with clay on the outer side. Set it on a trivet
        over a gentle fire of three or four coals, stirring it all the
        time with a small wooden rod, and be careful to shut your mouth
        and nose, because the fumes are destructive to the teeth.
        Continue to stir till all the Mercury has disappeared, and there
        remains a subtle body of more intense blackness. Repeat this
        even to the third time, till the body is pulverized and
        intensely black. Then take it, place it in a smaller vessel, and
        pour on it as much of the aforesaid oil as will moisten it;
        close the vessel, and let it stand over a lamp; in three days
        the body will be dried, and it will begin to assume a whitish
        appearance. Pour on more oil as before; dry by the same fire,
        and the substance will exhibit an increased whiteness. Repeat
        the process up to the fourth time; the substance will then have
        turned of a dazzling whiteness, delicate as an orient pearl of
        the purest water. Then proceed with our ore, salt, and gum,
        which must become one. A gentle fire can do no harm, but the
        warmth of horsedung is better. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blackness of the substance, when it
        appears, is not the blackness of ink, but a bright ebony colour.
        When it has been changed into whiteness, we must then look out
        for the appearance of the saffron hue, which will in no long
        time be followed by a most glorious ruby colour. Between the
        appearance of M (the white colour) and Q (the ruby colour) there
        should be an interval of thirty days, during which the heat of
        the fire should be slightly increased, and the vessel kept
        carefully closed. The substance will then be perfect, and you
        should carefully preserve it for your own use and that of your
        friends. One part of it will transmute 2,000 parts of any base
        metal into its own glorious nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change one drachm of M into Q, add to it
        three ounces of D and one ounce of C. Subject the whole to
        gentle coction for thirty days, till it passes through K, after
        which you will behold perfect. Q, round and red. When you have
        performed and accomplished all this, you may consider yourself
        as a great master; and you should render to the great and good
        God fervent and constant thanks for His unspeakable benefit.
        Thus I have bestowed upon you a gift, gentle reader, the vast
        value of which will be understood by generations to come. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have drawn the composition of the trees
        of the grove together; we will now describe their natures one by
        one, according to the best of our ability. We will, in the first
        place, begin with those trees upon the left, the scrolls whereof
        simply encircle the bark, and with their purgation as
        follows:--- The first tree is hot, dry, red, like red-hot
        bronze. It becomes moist, dry, and black, like lead; cold and
        humid, like quicksilver; hot, humid, and saffron-coloured. </p>

        <p><img src="b16.jpg" height="167" width="70"></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second tree is hot and dry, like glowing
        brass; it becomes humid and black, like quicksilver; dry and
        white, like lead; hot, humid, and saffron-coloured, like
        blood-red gold. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third tree is hot, dry, and red. It
        becomes dry and black, like lead; humid and white, like tin or
        quicksilver; hot, humid, and saffron, like blood-red gold. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first tree on the right-hand side has a
        scroll which enters the front and comes out on the other side;
        it is hot, humid, and saffron-coloured, like red-hot gold. It
        becomes dry and black, like earthy silver; humid, like silver;
        hot, dry, and red, like red-hot bronze. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three rules must be carefully observed in
        our art: first prepare the right substance; then carry on the
        work continuously, so that it may not be marred by interruption;
        thirdly, be patient, and follow always in the footsteps of
        Nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get (as your substance) highly purified
        Water of Life, and keep it; but do not suppose that the liquid
        which moistens all things, is the bright and limpid liquid of
        Bacchus. For while you anxiously look about in out-of-the-way
        places for extraordinary events, you pass by the sparkling waves
        of the blessed stream. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the Palace in which are fifteen
        mansions, where the king, his brow circled with the diadem, sits
        on a lofty throne, holding in his hand the sceptre of the whole
        world before him, his son and five servants kneel in robes of
        different colours, imploring him to bestow upon his son and his
        servants a share of his power; but he does not even reply to
        their request. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b1.jpg" height="222" width="385"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The son, incited by the servants, stabs the
        father as he sits on the throne. (Let an amalgam be made with
        highly purified water, etc.) </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b2.jpg" height="243" width="385"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the third picture we see the son catching
        his father's blood in his robe (which is the second process of
        our art, already explained in the method). </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b3.jpg" height="197" width="386"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A grave is dug in the fourth mansion (which
        is the furnace). Its depth is two hand-breadths, and its width
        four inches. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b4.jpg" height="226" width="368"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fifth mansion the son thought to
        throw his father into the grave, and to leave him there; but (by
        means of our art) both fell in together. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b5.jpg" height="187" width="368"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth mansion is that in which the son
        still strives to get out, but one (who sprang from them in the
        second operation) comes, and prevents him from so doing. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b6.jpg" height="226" width="367"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the father and son are in the tomb,
        which is called the seventh mansion, there follows putrefaction
        in their ashes, or a very hot bath. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b7.jpg" height="203" width="367"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eighth mansion, that which happened
        during the putrefaction is inspected, the vase having become
        cold, etc. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b8.jpg" height="234" width="396"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ninth mansion the bones are taken
        from the tomb. This happens when the whole body has been
        dissolved by successive solution, which, being done, keep it
        carefully. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b9.jpg" height="238" width="394"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the tenth mansion, the bones are divided
        into nine parts, the dissolved substance being subjected to
        gentle coction for nine days, till a portion of it turns black.
        Remove this latter, and keep it in another vessel in a hot
        place. Subject the water to gentle heat for another nine days.
        Again remove that which has turned black, and put it with the
        rest. Continue the operation till the water is clear and pure.
        Let its Water of Life be poured over the black substance in a
        small glass vessel, so that it shall float over it to the height
        of an inch, and let it stand nine days over a gentle fire,
        renewing the water every day, if necessary. (Thus the earth will
        become clear and white, according to the teaching of the
        philosophers ; for this earth is putrefied and purified with its
        water.) </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b10.jpg" height="219" width="396"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An angel is sent, who casts the bones on the
        purified and whitened earth (which is now mixed with its seed,
        and let the whole be placed in a closed jar with its alembic.
        Let the thicker substance be divided from the water by a more
        violent fire, and remain as a hard substance at the bottom.) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eleventh mansion the servants pray
        God to restore their king. Henceforth the whole work is
        concerned with his restoration. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="b11.jpg" height="222" width="385"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this purpose a second angel is sent in
        the twelfth mansion, who places the other part of those bones on
        the earth (till they are all thickened: then a wonderful thing
        happens). </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, a succession of angels is sent, who
        cast the first, second, third, and fourth part of the bones on
        the earth, where they become white, transparent; and firm. The
        fifth and sixth parts are changed into yellow, and so also with
        the seventh, eighth, and ninth; the earth of the bones becomes
        as red as blood or rubies. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both among ancients and moderns the question
        whether Alchemy be a real Art or a mere imposture has exercised
        many heads and pens; nor is it possible for us entirely to
        ignore the existence of such a dispute. A multiplicity of
        arguments has been advanced against the truth of our Art; but
        men like Geber and Morienus, who were best fitted to come
        forward in its defense, have disdained to answer the caviling
        attacks of the vulgar. They have not, as a matter of fact,
        furnished us with anything beyond the bare assertion that the
        truth of Alchemy is exalted beyond the reach of doubt, We will
        not follow their example, but, in order to get at the foundation
        of the matter, we will pass in review the arguments which have
        been, or may be, set forth on both sides of the question. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of a science which is familiarly
        known to a great body of learned men, the mere fact that they
        all believe in it supersedes the necessity of proof. But this
        rule does not apply to the Art of Alchemy, whose pretensions,
        therefore, need to be carefully and jealously sifted. The
        arguments which make against the justice of those claims must be
        fairly stated, and it will be for the professors of the Art to
        turn back the edge of all adverse reasoning. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every ordinary art (as we learn in the
        second book of the Physics) is either dispositive of substance,
        or productive of form, or it teaches the use of something. Our
        Art, however, does not belong to any one of these categories; it
        may be described indeed as both dispositive and productive, but
        it does not teach the use of anything. It truly instructs us how
        to know the one substance exclusively designed by Nature for a
        certain purpose and it also acquaints us with the natural method
        of treating and manipulating this substance, a knowledge which
        may be either practically or speculatively present in the mind
        of the master. There are other crafts which are not artificial,
        but natural, such as the arts of medicine, of horticulture, and
        glass-blowing. They are arts insofar as they require an
        operator; but they are natural insofar as they are based upon
        facts of Nature. Such is the Art of Alchemy. Some arts
        systematize the creations of the human mind, as, for instance,
        those of grammar, logic, and rhetoric; but Alchemy does not
        belong to this class. Yet Alchemy resembles other arts in the
        following respect, that its practice must be preceded by theory
        and investigation; for before we can know how to do a thing, we
        must understand all the conditions and circumstances under which
        it is produced. If we rightly apprehend the cause or causes of a
        thing (for there often is a multiplicity or complication of
        causes), we also know how to produce that thing. But it must
        further be considered that no one can claim to be heard in
        regard to the truth or falsity of this Art who does not clearly
        understand the matter at issue; and we may lay it down as a rule
        that those who set up as judges of this question without a clear
        insight into the conditions of the controversy should be
        regarded as persons who are talking wildly and at random. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Reasons Apparently Militating Against The Reality Of
              Our Art.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was usual among the ancients to begin
        with a destructive argument. This custom we will now follow. </p>
      <p><i>Reason First.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever is ignorant of the elements of which
        any given substance is composed, and of the quantities of each
        element in such composition, cannot know how to produce that
        substance. Now, the alchemists are necessarily ignorant of the
        exact composition of metals: therefore, as the metals are
        composite substances, it is not possible that the alchemists
        should know how to produce them. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Second.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, if you are unacquainted with the
        determinate proportion of the elements entering into the
        composition of any given substance, you cannot possibly produce
        that substance. I allude to the exact degree of digestion which
        has taken place in, and the peculiar manner and mode of
        composition which constitute the specific essence, or form, of
        any assigned substance, and make it what it is. This specific
        form of metals can never become known to a human artist. It is
        one of Nature’s own secrets, and the Art of Alchemy must,
        therefore, be pronounced not only unknowable, but utterly
        impossible. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Third.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also ignorant of the proper or
        specific instrument, or means, which Nature uses to produce
        those peculiar substances defined as metals. We are aware that
        Nature, in the production of every different substance, uses a
        certain modified form of digestive heat. But in the case of
        metals, this digestive heat is not derived from the sun, or,
        exclusively, from any central fire, for it is inextricably mixed
        and compounded of the two, and this in a manner no man can
        imitate. Therefore, Alchemy is impossible. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Fourth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, we know that the generation of
        metals occupies thousands of years. This is the case in Nature’s
        workshop in the bowels of the earth: hence we see that even if
        this Art were possible, man’s life would not be long enough for
        its exercise. Everything requires for its generation a certain
        predetermined period of time; and we find in the case of animals
        and vegetables that this period of generation and development
        cannot be hastened to any considerable extent. It might indeed
        be said that Art can do in a month what Nature requires a
        thousand years to accomplish --- by intensifying and exalting
        the temperature of the digestive warmth. But such a course would
        defeat its own object, since a greater degree of heat than is
        required for the development of metals (i.e., an unnatural
        temperature) would hinder rather than accelerate that
        development. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Fifth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the generation of metals, as of all
        things else, can only be accomplished in a certain place
        specially adapted to the purpose. Definite peculiar local
        conditions must be fulfilled if a seed it to spring up and grow;
        an animal can only be generated and developed in its own proper
        womb. Now, glass, stone, and earthenware jars and vessels can
        never take the place of the natural womb of metals in the bosom
        of the earth. Hence, Alchemy is nothing but a fraudulent
        pretence. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Sixth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more, that which is effected by Nature
        alone, cannot be produced artificially; and metals belong to
        this class of substances. Generation and corruption are the
        effect of an inward principle, and this inward principle is
        Nature, which creates the substantial forms of things. Art, on
        the other hand, is an outward principle, which can only bring
        about superficial changes. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Seventh.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Art cannot produce that which is of easy
        separation, and, therefore, of easy competition, it cannot
        produce that the separation and composition of which are more
        difficult. Now, a horse or a dog are easily decomposed, while
        the putrefaction of metals requires a great length of time. But
        yet Art cannot produce a horse or a dog; hence it can still less
        produce metals. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Eighth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metals do indeed belong to the same genus or
        kind; they are all metals, just as a horse and a man are both
        animals. But as a horse and man are specifically different, and
        as one species cannot be changed into another, so the various
        metals are specifically different; and as a dog can never become
        a an, so neither can one metal be changed into another. This
        reason and its solution are advanced by Geber. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Ninth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principles which stir up the vital spark
        slumbering in metals are necessarily unknown to the student of
        Nature. For these principles are supplied by the movements and
        influences of the stars and heavenly bodies, which are overruled
        by the Supreme Intelligence, and preside over the generation,
        corruption, and conservation of species, imparting to everything
        its own peculiar form and perfection. These influences which
        determine whether a certain metallic substance shall be gold,
        silver, etc., no human mind can possibly fix or direct to any
        given spot. Therefore, etc. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Tenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial things bear the same relation to
        natural things which Art bears to Nature, But as Art is not
        Nature, neither are artificial things the same as natural
        things: and artificial gold, even if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produced,
        would no be the same thing as natural gold. For the methods of
        Nature are inward, they are always one and the same, and never
        vary; but the methods of Art, on the other hand, vary with the
        idiosyncrasies of the artist. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Eleventh.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easier to destroy than to make thing:
        but we can hardly destroy gold; how then can we make it? </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twelfth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient philosophers were in the habit
        of teaching all the arts and sciences they knew to their
        disciples, and of declaring them in their books; but of this Art
        they never mention a word, which proves that it was unknown to
        them, Moreover, Aristotle tells us that if a man knows a thing
        he can teach it: but the books of the so-called Alchemistic
        Sages are full of obscurities and a wantonly perplexing
        phraseology. This shews that their boasted knowledge was an
        impudent pretense. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Thirteenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many ancient Sages, as well as kings and
        princes, who had hundreds of profound scholars at their beck and
        call, have sought the knowledge of this Art in vain; now, this
        would not have been the case if it had any real existence. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Fourteenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alchemists say that their one Stone changes
        all metals into gold; this would mean that it hardens lead and
        tin, which are softer than gold, and that it softens silver,
        iron, and bronze, which are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harder than gold.
        But it is impossible that one and the same thing should produce
        opposite effects. If, indeed, it could produce two such mutually
        exclusive effects, it would have to do the one <i>per se</i>
        and the other <i>per accidens</i> --- and either that which is
        hardened or that which is softened would not be true gold. We
        should thus have to assume the existence of two Stones, one
        which hardens and colours <i>per se</i>, and one which softens
        and colours <i>per se</i>; but this would be in flat
        contradiction to one of the few clear statements of the
        Alchemists themselves. And even if there were two different
        Stones, their difference would be reproduced in their effects,
        and there would thus result two different kinds of gold, which
        is impossible. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Fifteenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If gold and silver could be evolved out of
        any metallic substance, they could be prepared most easily out
        of that which is most akin to them; but as it is impossible to
        prepare them out of their first principles, viz., quicksilver
        and sulphur, they cannot be evolved out of metals specifically
        different from them. For it is clear that out of these two
        matters all metals are derived and generated; orpiment, sal
        armoniac, and secondary spirits like marcasite, magnesia, and
        tutia, being all reducible to these two primary forms. There are
        seven spirits in Alchemy, the four principal ones, quicksilver,
        sulphur, <i>orpiment</i>, and sal armoniac, and the three
        secondary and composite spirits, marcasite, magnesia and tutia;
        but sulphur and quicksilver include them all. The Stone would
        have to be obtained either from the metals or from these
        spirits. But the sages represent the Stone as bearing the same
        relation to the metals which is borne by form to substance, or,
        soul to body: hence, it cannot be extracted from such gross
        things as metals. They do indeed say that by calcining,
        dissolving, distilling, and coagulating those bodies they purge
        out all that is gross, and render the metals spiritual and
        subtle. But they know well enough that any fire violent enough
        to perform this would kill or destroy the vital germ of the
        metal. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor can so highly spiritual a substance as
        the Philosopher’s Stone is represented be obtained from the
        metallic spirits (sulphur and quicksilver). For they must be
        either fixed or volatile. If they are volatile they are useless:
        they evaporate when exposed to the action of fire, and leave
        bodies still more impure and defiled than they were before; or
        they even cause other bodies to evaporate along with them. If,
        on the other hand, the spirits in a fixed state are to represent
        the Stone, they will not be able to accomplish any of those
        things which the Stone is supposed to encompass. For, in that
        case, they are hard and petrine, like earth or flint, and thus
        are unable to enter other bodies and pervade them with their own
        essence. If they are subjected to the violent action of fire,
        they become like glass, i.e., they undergo a process of
        vitrification, and, with their metallic humour, they lose their
        malleability and all their other metallic properties. Even lead
        and tin become glass when their metallic humour is burnt out of
        them, and it is rank absurdity to say that the vitreous humour
        is malleable, or ever can become so; for it is the metallic
        humour which renders metals malleable and fusible. Moreover,
        glass, or anything vitrified, in melting does not amalgamate
        with other metals, but floats on the surface like oil. Besides,
        quicksilver in its natural state adheres to all metals, but it
        does not adhere either to marcasite (which resembles it too
        closely for such a purpose), nor to glass: this shews,
        incontrovertibly, that glass is no metal, whether such glass be
        natural, or some other substance vitrified. Again, glass, or any
        vitrified substance, when it has been dipped in cold water, or
        otherwise refrigerated, can be broken, pounded, and converted
        into powder; but all metals will bend rater than break, because
        of their greater malleability and the metallic humour which is
        in them. You can also either engrave or stamp any image upon
        cold metals and it will retain that image; but glass (unless in
        a state of fusion) will do nothing of the kind. Thus, it appears
        that malleability is a property which belongs to metals, and to
        metals only; and in the various metals this property, with the
        property of fusibility, exists in different degrees, according
        to the grade of their digestion and sulphureous admixtion. In
        glass, too, there are different proportions of fusibility,
        perspicuity, opacity, and colouring, which depend upon
        differences of the material used in its manufacture. Only metals
        in a cold state are capable of a certain degree of liquefaction;
        glass, on account of its great viscosity, may be liquefied when
        it is melted in a fiercely heated furnace, but not after
        refrigeration, because then the aforesaid viscosity disappears.
        When metal is cold or red hot its viscosity is greatest, and in
        such a state it can be expanded; but fusion separates its
        different parts, and then much of this viscosity is lost. With
        glass the very opposite is the case. Therefore, if by
        calcinations a metallic spirit becomes vitrified, it is not
        capable of any further change; and, being fixed, it cannot enter
        other bodies, or convert them. Therefore, also, if metallic
        spirits. Which are the very vital principles of gold and silver,
        cannot evolve them out of metals, nothing else can. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Sixteenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the Alchemists appear to say that
        they do not create metals, but only develop those which are
        imperfect; they call gold and silver perfect metals, and the
        rest imperfect. We reply that this is an impossibility. The fact
        is that everything which has its own substantial form, and all
        its peculiar properties, is specifically perfect. A horse is
        perfect as a horse, though it has not the rational nature of a
        man; and tin and lead are as perfect in their way as gold and
        silver. Whatever is perfectly that which it was designed to be,
        the same also is bound so to remain; thus, lead and tin are
        fully as permanent and enduring as gold and silver. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Seventeenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, whatever is multiplied by Nature
        after its kind, in its own species, may be regarded as
        permanently belonging to that species. And tin and lead, etc.,
        are of this class. They are not an imperfect form of that which
        we behold perfected in gold and silver. They are base metals,
        while gold and silver are precious; and a base thing can never
        develop into a precious thing, just as a goat can never become a
        horse or a man. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Eighteenth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there is not the same ultimate
        disposition of elements, there cannot be the same substantial
        and specific form. Now alchemistic gold and silver cannot
        exhibit the same ultimate arrangement as natural gold and
        silver; consequently, they are not the same thing. Hence, if
        there be such a thing as alchemistic gold, it is specifically
        different from ordinary gold. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twentieth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything that is contingent, and liable to
        chance, cannot be the subject matter of science: for science
        deals with the necessary, incorruptible, and eternal. The
        Alchemists themselves say that the secret of their Art seldom
        becomes known to any one: hence they themselves put their own
        claims to scientific accuracy out of court. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-First.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Aristotle (<i>Meteor</i>. IV) ---
        according to the ancient version --- expressly denies the truth
        of Alchemy, calling it a sophistical and fantastical pretense
        --- though some say those words were interpolated by Avicenna
        (which, however, we do not believe). We beg leave to transcribe
        Aristotle’s very words: Let me tell the Alchemists that no true
        change can take place between species; but they can produce
        things resembling those they desire to imitate; and they can
        tinge (i.e., colour) with red and orange so as to produce the
        appearance of gold, and with white so as to produce the
        appearance of silver (tin or lead). They can also purge away the
        impurities of lead (so as to make it appear gold or silver); yet
        it will never be anything but lead; and even though it looks
        like silver, yet its properties will still be those of lead. So
        these people are mistaken, like those who take armoniac salt for
        common salt --- which seem the same and yet are in realty very
        much diverse. But I do not believe that the most exquisite
        ingenuity can possibly devise any means of successfully
        eliminating the specific difference (i.e., the substantial form)
        of metals. The properties and accidents which constitute the
        specific difference are not such as to be perceived with the
        senses; and since the difference is not cognizable (i.e., not
        sensuously perceptible), how can we know whether they have had
        it removed or not? Moreover, the composition of the various
        metallic substances is different, and, therefore, it is
        impossible that one should be changed into another, unless they
        be first reduced to their common prime substance. But this
        cannot be brought about by mere liquefaction, though it may
        appear to be done by the addition of extraneous matter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By these words the philosopher seems to
        imply that there can be no such thing as a pure Alchemistic Art,
        that which passes current under the name being mere fanciful and
        deceptive talk. From his remarks we elicit five reasons which
        (apparently) militate against the truth of our Art. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-Second.</i> <br>
        <i>[The First of Aristotle]</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He who only changes the accidents of things,
        does not change them specifically, and, as the substantial form
        remains the same, we cannot say that any real alteration has
        been effected. Now, the transformation (if any) which takes
        place in Alchemy is of this kind; therefore, we may confidently
        assert that it is not real. Alchemists may, as it were, wash out
        the impurities of lead and in, and make them look like gold and
        silver; but in their substantial form they are still neither
        better nor worse than lead and tin. Certain foreign ingredients
        (colouring matter, etc.) may make people fancy that they see
        real gold and silver before them. But those are the same people
        who could not tell the difference between common salt and salt
        of ammonia. Nevertheless, these two, though generically the
        same, exhibit considerable specific differences, and no skilled
        master of chemistry could possibly confound them. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-Third.</i> <br>
        <i>[The Second of Aristotle]</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any transformation that does not involve the
        destruction of the substantial and specific pre-existent form,
        is no real transformation at all, but a mere juggling pretense.
        Now this exactly described the performances of Alchemy. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-Fourth.</i> <br>
        <i>[The Third of Aristotle]</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible for us to know whether a
        thing which in itself is incapable of being perceived by our
        senses has been removed or not. Now, the specific differences of
        metals belong to this category: therefore, Alchemy falsely
        claims the power of accomplishing a thing which in reality
        transcends all human possibility and knowledge. The external
        characteristics with which we are acquainted in metals are not
        those which constitute their inward and essential nature, but
        their accidents, and properties, and passivities, which are
        alone subject to the cognizance of our senses. If this
        mysterious and deeply hidden something could be touched and
        handled, we might hope to destroy, or abolish, and change it.
        But, as it is, such an attempt must be considered utterly
        hopeless. </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-Fifth.</i> <br>
        <i>[The Fourth of Aristotle]</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things which are not mixed in the same
        elementary proportions, and are not compounded after the same
        manner, cannot be regarded as belonging to an identical species.
        Now, this relation does not exist between natural gold and the
        metals which Alchemy claims to transmute into that metal.
        Consequently, they cannot become real gold. The fact is that we
        are ignorant of the true composition of the precious metals ---
        and how can we bring about a result the nature of which is not
        clear to us? </p>
      <p><i>Reason Twenty-Sixth</i> <br>
        <i>[The Fifth of Aristotle]</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One species can only be transmuted into
        another by returning into the first substance common to both,
        before each was differentiated in the assumption of its own
        substantial form. This first substance must then be developed
        into the other species. But such a complicated operation the
        Alchemists fail to achieve. They do not reduce the metals to the
        first substance; hence there is with them no true generation,
        nor is there any genuine corruption, but only a spurious
        manipulation of accidents. They melt the metal in their furnace,
        and then add to it certain prepared chemical substances which
        change its appearance; but no one can say that there has been a
        true transformation. So long as they do not reduce the metal to
        its first substance, and then introduce into it another
        substantial form, it will still be the same metal, whatever
        alterations they may seem to effect in its outward appearance.
        The original substance and first principle of gold and silver
        are quicksilver and sulphur. To this substance they cannot
        reduce any metal by bare liquefaction. Hence their transmutation
        of metals is never true, but only sophistical. If you wish to
        generate a man out of meat and vegetables, and other food that
        is eaten, this food will first have to become blood, and the
        blood will have to undergo a chemical change into seed, before
        it can be available for purposes of generation. In the same way,
        if any metal is to become gold and silver, it must first become
        quicksilver and sulphur. The Alchemists may indeed say that
        there is between the metals no specific, but only an accidental
        difference. They suppose that the base metals are in a diseased
        condition, while gold and silver exhibit the healthy state of
        the metallic substance; and thus they contend that lead and tin
        can be converted into gold and silver by a mere alterative
        motion, just as an alterative motion (produced by some medicine)
        may convert a diseased into a healthy man. But this is
        equivalent to the affirmation that, apart from the morbid matter
        which they contain, all metals are actually gold, and here is an
        assertion which is impossible to substantiate. If all metals
        have the same substantial form, they have the same properties
        and passivities; for properties and passivities are directly the
        outcome of the substantial form. Hence all metals would have the
        same properties and qualities (whether active or passive) as
        gold. But this is not the case; for they do not abide the test
        of fire as gold does, nor have they the same comforting
        medicinal effect, which proves that the difference between them
        is not merely accidental, but specific. Yet they might again
        advance that, though all metals have the same substantial
        qualities and properties, because these are kept inactive or
        obscured by the morbid matter; as, for instance, when a man
        suffers from epilepsy, or apoplexy, or madness, he cannot
        perform the operations of a complete man; and if a women suffer
        from contraction of the womb, or syncope, she may have the
        substantial form of a woman, and yet she cannot exercise all the
        functions of a woman. They further say that, as in the human
        subject this incapacity is removed by the alterative action of
        some medicine, so in metals, the full effects of the substantial
        form (which is that of gold) may be brought out by alchemistic
        action. But the substantial form is not complete until the
        development is fully accomplished, and if the base metals are
        not fully developed, they can have no real substantial form, let
        alone that of gold and silver. And if a thing have not the
        substantial form with anything else, it cannot have, even in a
        latent condition, the properties and qualities characteristic of
        that thing, Nothing can have the peculiar qualities of a man
        that has not the form (i.e., the essential characteristics) of a
        man. The form of gold consists in the brightness which the
        sulphur receives from the purifying quicksilver indigestion.
        This brightness belongs only to gold and silver, or even to gold
        exclusively, as will be shewn. It is a sign that the development
        of these precious metals is complete, and the fact that the
        other metals do not possess it also shews that they cannot have
        the substantial form or essential characteristics of gold. Hence
        the comparison of these base metals to diseased bodies is false
        and misleading. We have thus demonstrated that the claims of
        Alchemy are frivolous, vain, and impossible. We might adduce
        other reasons, but we believe those already given to be
        sufficient. </p>

        <p><b><i>Now We Will Proceed To Prove The Truth Of The Art Of
              Alchemy.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may prove the truth of our Art --- </p>
      <p>(1) By the testimony of the Sages. <br>
        (2) By the most forcible arguments. <br>
        (3) By analogy, and manifest examples. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aristotle, in the <i>Dialectics</i>, says
        that every master has a right to speak authoritatively with
        reference to his own art. According to this rule, it is the
        Sages, and the Sages only, that ought to be consulted with
        reference to the truth of Alchemy. Now, we find that ancient
        philosophers, who have written with remarkable clearness and
        force on other arts and sciences, have given their testimony to
        the truth and authenticity of this Art in books which they have
        devoted thereto. They have described it as an art which
        regulates natural action, working upon a proper matter, towards
        the attainment of a design of Nature’s own conceiving, to which
        also Nature cannot attain without the aid of the intelligent
        artist, the same being further performed, as it is said, after
        one only method. Hence Hermes: It is true without falsehood,
        certain, and most true; that which is above is even as that
        which is below, and that which is below is like unto that which
        is above, for the accomplishment of the wonders of one thing.
        And Morienus: If, therefore, thou shalt rightly consider those
        things which I shall say unto thee, as also the testimonies of
        the ancients, well and fully shalt thou know that we agree in
        all things, and so all of us reveal the same truths. This was
        the deliberate conviction of Hermes, in his Secreta, who is
        styled the father and prophet of the Sages, of Pythagorus,
        Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, Democritus, Aristotle, Zeno,
        Heraclitus, Diogenes, Lucas, Hippocrates, Hamec, Thebit, Geber,
        Rhasis, Haly, Morienus, Theophilus, Parmenides, Mellisus,
        Empedocles, Abohaly, Abinceni, Homer, Ptolomeus, Virgil, Ovid,
        and many other philosophers and lovers of truth, whose names
        would be too tedious to record. Of most of these we have seen
        and studied the works, and can testify that they were, without a
        single exception, adepts, and brothers of this most glorious
        order, and that they knew what they were speaking about. Hermes,
        in his second book, says: My son, reflect on all that you hear,
        for I do not suppose that you are deprived of reason, etc.
        Rhasis (in his book on the <i>Perfect Magistery</i>), exhorting
        us unto a like earnestness, bids us read incessantly the
        writings of philosophy that we may be her sons, and get
        understanding in this arcane magistery. For he who does not read
        books cannot apprehend the details of our Art; he who knows
        nothing about the theory of our Art, will find its practice very
        difficult. Geber, in the Prologue of his <i>Sum of Perfection</i>,
        exhorts the student to pore over his volumes by day and by
        night, and to resolve them diligently in his mind, that so he
        may perceive the drift of our directions. Galen declares that
        theory and practice mutually correct and supplement each other,
        True theory is borne out by practice; false theory is shamed and
        disgraced by it. Moreover, when the science is obscure, and has
        been handed down after the manner of a dark tradition, there is
        all the more reason for reference to the adepts of the past
        therein. For which reason, says the philosopher in his second
        book of <i>Ethics</i>: In things which are obscure it is
        necessary to have recourse to open testimonies. So also
        Morienus: While every thing is distinguished according to its
        effects, the facts confirmed by the testimony of many. Rhasis
        (c. 70) bids us pin our faith to the ancient sages. Abohaly,
        that is to say, Avicenna, in his book on Medicine, and the
        chapter in which he discuses the confinement of fevers to
        certain places, says that where they do not occur, the people
        would not therefore be justified in supposing that they do not
        exist. In the same way, no man in his senses would deny the
        truth of Alchemy for the very insufficient reason that he
        himself is ignorant of it: such a person would be content with
        the authority of weighty names like Hermes, Hippocrates, and
        numerous others. There are many reasons why the master conceal
        this art. But if any one denies its existence on the ground that
        he is ignorant of it, he is like someone who has been shut up
        all his life in a certain house, and therefore denies that the
        world extends beyond the four walls of his habitation. There is
        not really any need to advance any arguments to establish the
        actuality of our art, for the art itself is the best proof of
        its own existence; and being securely lodged in the stronghold
        of knowledge, we might safely despise the contradiction of the
        ignorant. Nevertheless, we will adduce a few arguments to prove
        the strength of our position. At the same time, we ask the
        reader to remember that our best and strongest arguments are
        based on facts which we are not at liberty to use. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Arguments [Particularly Two Strong Ones] In Favor Of
              Our Most Glorious Art.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is most difficult to establish the claims
        of this Art argumentatively. Aristotle tells us that, in some
        cases, certain arguments are so nicely balanced as to leave the
        mid in a sate of uncertainty as to what is the exact truth; in
        other cases [he says] the subject matter hardly admits of a
        logical demonstration. To this latter class belongs the case of
        Alchemy. In all operative sciences (as Aristotle sets forth) the
        truth of a proposition ought to be sewn, not by logical
        argument, but by ocular demonstration. The appeal should be not
        to the intellect, but to the senses. For particulars belong to
        the domain of sense, while universals belong to the domain of
        reason. If we are unable to convey to any one an ocular proof of
        our Art, this fact must not be regarded as casting a slur on our
        veracity. The difficulty of our task is enhanced by the
        circumstance that we have to speak of our Art to the ignorant
        and scornful, and are thus in the position of a painter who
        should attempt to explain nice shades and differences of colour
        to the colour-blind; or of a musician who should discourse sweet
        harmony to the deaf. Every one, says Aristotle, is able to form
        a correct opinion only of those things which are familiarly and
        accurately known to him; but he who denies that snow is white
        cannot have any eyes in his head. How can any one discover the
        truth in regard to any science, if he lacks the sense to
        distinguish the special province of matter, or the material
        relations, with which that science deals? Such people need to
        exercise faith even to become aware of the existence of our Art.
        Pythagoras, in the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>, says that those
        who are acquainted with the elements will not be numbered among
        deniers. A doctor who desires to prove that a certain medicine
        will produce a certain effect in a diseased condition of the
        human body, must substantiate his position by practical
        experiment. For instance, some one suffers from a
        super-abundance of red colour in the veins of the stomach and
        liver, and I say that the cure is an evacuation after digestion.
        If I wished to discover what medicine would produce this effect,
        I would say: Everything that, after digestion, produces an
        evacuation of bile, will heal the patient. Now, I know that
        rhubarb or scamonea will produce this effect; therefore, rhubarb
        or scamonea will be the right remedy to choose. Nevertheless,
        the truth of my assertion could be satisfactorily proven only by
        means of a practical experiment. In all these matters, as Hamec
        says, nothing short of seeing a thing will help you to know it.
        If you wish to know that pepper is hot and that vinegar is
        cooling, that colocynth and absinthe are bitter, that honey is
        sweet, and that aconite is poison; that the magnet attracts
        steel, that <i>arsenic</i> whitens brass, and that tutia turns
        it of an orange colour, you will, in every one of these cases,
        have to verify the assertion by experience. It is the same in
        Geometry, Astronomy, Music, Perspective, and other sciences with
        a practical scope and aim. A like rule applies with double force
        to Alchemy, which undertakes to transmute the base metals into
        gold and silver. Whatsoever has the power to transmute imperfect
        and complete metals has the power to make gold and silver. Now,
        this quality is possessed by the Stone which the philosophers
        make known to us. It is plain that there are but two perfect
        metals, namely, gold and silver; just as there are but two
        perfect luminaries, namely, sun and moon. The other metals are
        imperfect and in complete, and whosoever educes them to
        perfection, the same also converts them into gold and silver.
        The truth and justice of this claim, like all other propositions
        of a practical nature, has to be demonstrated by a practical
        experiment, and in no other way can it be satisfactorily shewn.
        But such a practical demonstration would, on the other hand,
        once for all put an end to the controversy, and convincingly
        demonstrate to every well-regulated mind the truth of the Art by
        which it is accomplished. Find our Art, says Galen, and you will
        have proved its reality, which is performed not by the first
        principles of the Art, but by its operations. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be borne in mind that this Art is
        the minister and follower of Nature. Hence the principles of
        Alchemy are twofold, natural and artificial. The natural
        principles are the causes of the four elements, of the metals,
        and all that belongs to them. The artificial principles are,
        according to Geber, eight in number: Sublimation, Separation,
        Distillation, Calcination, Dissolution, Coagulation, Fixion, and
        Ceration, besides all the tests, signs, and colours by which we
        know whether these operations have been properly performed or
        not. The tests of gold are Inceration, Cementation, Ignition,
        Fusion, Exposure to corroding vapours, Mixture with some
        solvent, etc. But there is also another high and divine
        principle which is the key and connecting link between all the
        others, without which it is impossible to accomplish our work,
        which also before all others ought to possess the mind of the
        student. That which is fixed destroys the specific form of that
        which is volatile, so as to do away with its volatile
        properties. If the volatile substance evaporates together with
        the fixed, the whole experiment is spoiled; but if the fixed
        retains the volatile and protects it from evaporation, our work
        is perfected. We know that substances whose root is earth and
        water can be dissolved and become liquid, but the adept has it
        in his power to preserve them. What is said about this principle
        in the books of the Sages is without doubt figuratively spoken
        by means of type and allegory, and therefore it is mere
        presumption on the part of an outsider to attempt to formulate
        an argument against our Art out of anything that the Sages have
        said. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second argument is as follows. Anything
        in which the specific properties, qualities, and operations of a
        certain substance are observed, is of the same nature with that
        substance. Now, we find in the gold and silver of Alchemy all
        the distinctive peculiarities of natural gold; consequently, it
        is natural gold. We do not know the substantial form of
        anything; we do know its qualities, properties, operations, and
        accidents; consequently, it is in regard to these particulars
        that we must look for agreement, because all our knowledge
        necessarily has a sensuous or perceptive basis. The substantial
        form, on the other hand, is nothing but a convenient
        intellectual abstraction. In determining the nature of anything,
        we must found our judgment on its practical manifestations. We
        say that whatever performs all the functions of an eye, is an
        eye; whatever does not is not really an eye, but only the shadow
        or image of an eye. A wooden saw is not a saw, but only a
        representation of a saw, etc., etc. I maintain, then, that we
        know a thing by its accidents; and as the substance of all
        metals is homogeneous, we may safely apply this rule to metallic
        substances. Every metal, then, which exhibits all the qualities
        of gold, orange colour, fusibility, malleability,
        indestructibility, homogeneous nature, and great density, must
        be regarded as gold, and it would be mere sophistry to try and
        make out that it is anything else. If the gold of Alchemy were
        not the same as natural gold, our detractors would be bound to
        shew that the very same specific properties can co-exist with
        substantial forms of an opposite and contradictory nature --- a
        task which they will find it very difficult to accomplish. This
        reasoning is borne out by several most important passages in the
        works of Plato and Aristotle [<i>Libell. De Secret. Secreto,
          cap. De Lapidibus Pretiosis</i>]. There are also other
        arguments which prove the truth of our Art, which will be set
        forth in our chapters on the principles, and on the generation
        of metals, and their transmutation. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>The Truth Of Our Art Proved By Analogy</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something closely analogous to the
        generation of Alchemy is observed in the animal, vegetable,
        mineral, and elementary world. Nature generates frogs in the
        clouds, or by means of putrefaction in dust moistened with rain,
        by the ultimate disposition of kindred substances. Avicenna
        tells us that a calf was generated in the clouds, amid thunder,
        and reached the earth in a stupefied condition. The
        decomposition of a basilisk generates scorpions. In the dead
        body of a calf are generated bees, wasps in the carcass of an
        ass, beetles in the flesh of a horse, and locusts in that of a
        mule. These generations depend on the fortuitous combination of
        the same elements by which the animal or insect is ordinarily
        produced. Aristotle (de Animal., 6), however, says, that these
        creatures do not belong to the same order as those generated in
        the ordinary way, and have not the same substantial form. We, on
        the other hand, maintain (and we are sure of having all
        common-sense people in agreement with us), that ants are ants,
        flies, flies, and spiders, spiders, in whatever way they
        originate. For in the vegetable world Nature produces out of
        decomposed matter, cabbages, parsley, and pumpkins, which
        afterwards exhibit the same flowers, fruit, and seed as those
        evolved in the ordinary way, and are also propagated in the same
        manner. We maintain that there are some things which are
        propagated by generation only, such as men, vipers, whales, and
        palm-trees; other things by putrefaction only, as lice, fleas,
        grass, earthworms, and similar imperfect existences; some things
        are propagated in both ways, like mice, beetles, wasps, etc.
        Everything depends, as we have said, on a certain disposition of
        elements and rearrangement of atoms; in this way a wild vine may
        become a good one by transplantation and the skill of the
        husbandman (as Aristotle tells us); moreover, the same
        philosopher vouches for the truth of the observation that good
        plants may often be reared from inferior seed, if there be a
        change of climate and other outward conditions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same law holds good in the mineral
        world, though not to quite so great an extent. Thunderbolts are
        formed in the clouds, and iron darts, amidst terrible
        explosions. These mineral substances are produced, according to
        Aristotle, (<i>Meteor</i>., IV end), by the rapid extinction and
        dessication of atmospherical fire. It is said that near Vergen
        there fell from the sky a piece of iron weighing 150 tons, which
        was so hard that it long resisted all attempts to work it up
        into swords and other iron implements. The Arabs relate that the
        Alemanic blades, which are very hard and well tempered, are
        fashioned of this kind of iron. Such great masses of metal are
        either formed suddenly by the fierce action of burning heat on a
        large lump of viscous clay, or, little by little, through the
        agency of some more gradual cause. There are certain places in
        which water, as it wells forth, is changed into stones of
        diverse colours; and we know there exists in the earth the
        mineral power of congealing water. We are also told that
        vegetables and animals may be converted into stone by a certain
        petrifying mineral action. Moreover, there is a spot in Arabia
        which imbues everything with its own colour. There the bread of
        Corascenus was changed into a stone, and yet retained its own
        colour. The same kind of spontaneous generation is also
        sometimes observed in the case of elements. By striking two hard
        stones together we produce fire; by boiling water, air is
        created; by the condensation of air, we obtain water; by the
        distillation of water, we become possessed of a residue of
        earth. All these examples we quote, not because they necessarily
        admit of verification, but in order to make our meaning plain to
        the uninitiated, and to shew, by analogous reasoning, the
        possibility of our art. To the uninitiated such confirmatory
        evidence, drawn from analogous facts, must seem both childish
        and unnecessary. Nor is there any process in Nature which is
        more than distantly and partially analogous to the operation of
        our most blessed Stone. The closest analogy is furnished by
        smoke, which may become fixed or condensed as soot; for here a
        spirit, as it were, evaporates from the fire, and assumes a
        corporeal form. The same may be said of the formation of tartar
        in good wine. For all vapour is spiritual in its nature, that is
        to say, its property is volatile. Out of dry vapours are
        generated dry things, and from humid vapours come moist
        substances; the digestion and proportionate commixture of both
        these kinds produce the diversity of all generated species,
        according to the exigency of their nature. And as these vapours,
        whether dry or moist, are actively fugitive and ascending, so
        are they potentially permanent and resting. If the alchemist by
        the preparation of this proper matter in a proper vessel, paying
        due attention to the significance of the sequence of colours,
        can obtain that which constitutes the essence of gold in a
        concentrated volatile or spiritual form, he can pervade with it
        every atom of a base metal, and thus transmute it into gold.
        This action of foreign bodies any one can observe on the surface
        of metals; tutia imparts to bronze the colour of gold, orpiment
        and arsenic colour it white like silver; the fumes of Saturn
        congeal quicksilver; the rind of the pomegranate converts iron
        into steel, and the fumes of burnt hair give silver an orange
        tinge. Let us suppose the metals to be penetrated by some more
        powerful and all-pervading agent in their very inmost parts, and
        throughout all their molecules --- and we have something very
        closely resembling the alleged action of the Philosopher’s
        Stone. The spirits of metals potentially contain their bodies,
        and this potentiality may at any moment become actual, if the
        artist understands, and knows how to imitate, Nature’s methods
        of working. </p>

        <p><b><i>A General Determination Upon The Difficulty Of The
              Question, With The Elucidation Thereof.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning this admirable, excellent,
        divine, and most secret Art, it is a matter of no ordinary
        difficulty to satisfactorily resolve the question of the
        actuality thereof, but, as appears from Aristotle, it is absurd
        to prove the existence of Nature, or to argue the possibility of
        what is know. Our subject is the transmutation of metals into
        true gold and silver by the skill of art. It deals not alone
        with the formation of metals in the earth but of their
        manufacture out of the earth. Alchemy is the Art by which the
        principles, causes, activities, properties, and affections of
        metals are thoroughly apprehended; and by means of this
        knowledge those metals which are imperfect, incomplete, mixed,
        and corrupt, and therefore base, are transmuted into gold and
        silver. We have here, as in medicine, practice founded upon
        sound and well-tested speculative knowledge; and here also, as
        in medicine, we can be practically successful, only if our
        knowledge be strictly in accordance with the facts of Nature.
        Alchemy is an operative science, and produces effects by
        supplying natural conditions, e.g., by the action of fire.
        Medicine is either preventative or curative; it either teaches
        us the conditions of health, and instructs us how to avoid
        disease, or, when we are ill, it provides the exact remedy which
        our disease requires. Alchemy has no need of conservative or
        preventative action; but it instructs us how to restore and
        cure, as it were, the diseases of metals, and to bring them back
        to a state of perfect health, in which state all metals are
        either silver or gold. The difficulties of our Art are great,
        especially on account of the disagreement which apparently
        prevails amongst its most authoritative exponents. The second
        difficulty of our Art is that of carrying out practically the
        clearest and most straightforward printed directions. This
        difficulty might be got over by watching the operations of some
        great master; but in the nature of the case, only few can enjoy
        so high a privilege. The third difficulty consists in the
        fantastic tricks and absurdly barren devices of fraudulent
        professors of this Art, in consequence of which many find it
        impossible to believe in the reality of our operations. And the
        claims of the Art itself appear so miraculous, and so far
        exalted above the ordinary course of Nature, that the vulgar
        herd are of necessity led to regard the Alchemist as a kind of
        sorcerer or magician, and to place his pretensions in the same
        class with those of the man who professes to work signs and
        wonders. These are but a few of the difficulties in which the
        study of our Art is involved; and if there be so many obstacles
        in the way of its investigation, how much more difficult must be
        the discovery of its methods? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I stoutly maintain that the
        Art of Alchemy is clear and true, and founded upon Nature; that
        its products are as truly silver and gold as the precious metals
        which are produced in the bowels of the earth; and that I am
        fully prepared to substantiate all these assertions in the
        following chapters, and to place them beyond the reach of
        reasonable doubt. We will triumphantly rebut the attacks of
        Aristotle, and refute all other objections, putting them to
        flight with the all-prevailing weapons of truth and reason.
        Aristotle in Nicom. Ethic. VII, says that if all difficulties
        are solves, and the contrary of every objection proved to be
        true, you can feel that you have established your position, but
        your refutation will be all the more convincing if you point out
        the cause of your opponent’s error. If, however, any man denies
        first principles, there is no possibility of reasoning with him;
        on the other hand, you can reason with a man who acknowledges
        first principles, and only arrives at erroneous results by a
        fallacious process of ratiocination. It is to this class of our
        opponents that we address the following statement of our
        position. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Explanatory Of Our Method Of Procedure In Determining
              This Question.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in order that the truth of this Art may
        be fully known, we will begin by citing the authority, and&nbsp;
        quoting the words of, the ancient Sages, subsequently resolving
        any doubt or difficulty which they may suggest. In every case we
        will take care to state our reasons. Any one that would write
        about Alchemy must know its terms, with its differences and its
        scope; and it is their ignorance of these particulars which has
        led many critics hastily to condemn our claims. Those who are
        ignorant of any science, are like the spectators who can
        distinguish neither the persons nor their gestures on the stage.
        A blind man might as well discourse about colours, and criticize
        the merits of a picture --- a deaf man might as well set up as a
        judge of some musical composition --- as an uninformed person
        presume to deliver judgment on the claims of the Art of Alchemy.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope and aim of that Art we have
        already defined. It is an operative science, of which the object
        is to transmute base metals into gold and silver. It is
        concerned with the principles, causes, properties and affections
        of metals. Principles are the efficient and final cause, which
        are both outward. Causes are described as the substance and
        form, which are the internal causes beginning to the very thing
        itself. Properties are the peculiar active operations of the
        metals (e.g., the strengthening virtue of gold). Affections are
        the qualities of metals in a passive state, e.g., of fire, and
        soon. The essential differences between the metals we do not
        know: hence we allege in their place the properties and
        accidents peculiar to each. It should further be remembered that
        no natural agent ceases from its action in a given substance
        until its end has been attained. In all metals quicksilver is
        understood for the substance, and sulphur for the active
        principle which supplies form to the matter; no metal is,
        therefore, complete and perfect, from which the sulphur has not
        become separated; and since this is the case only in gold, gold
        alone represents the first and true intention of Nature with
        regard to metals; all other metals still contain an admixture of
        sulphur, and are imperfect. The incomplete metals are called
        mixed metals, because here the agent is still mixed with the
        substance; and this sulphur is one of the great occasions of the
        corruptibility of metals: it blackens them, and causes them to
        evaporate and be burned in the fire, but gold ever enjoys
        immunity from this defect, whether in or out of the fire. The
        transmutation of metals into gold, then, must consist in the
        elimination of this sulphur, which result is brought about only
        by the Philosopher’s Stone, and by that instantly, for it acts
        both within and without, the exterior alteration being followed
        by the interior transmutation for the generation of the form of
        gold. Alchemy (i.e., the Elixir of Alchemy) is a corporeal
        substance, made of one thing, by the operation of one thing,
        says Lilium. In medicine we apply the same remedy which it
        prescribes; and a like analogy we must be permitted to follow in
        our most glorious Art of Alchemy. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>After Shewing The Two Chief Difficulties Of Alchemy, We
              Proceed To Exhibit All The Different Modes of These
              Difficulties.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To one who is acquainted with the scope and
        meaning of this Art, it is not strange that only few attain to
        our knowledge; to him the wonder is rather that any man has ever
        succeeded in discovering its methods. </p>
      <p><i>The First Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The achievements of our Art seem miraculous
        rather than in accordance with the ordinary working of Nature.
        Hence Sages like Hermes, Barsenus, Rhasis, Rosinus, and others,
        tell us that it is only by Divine inspiration, or by ocular
        demonstration, that the student can understand the directions of
        his teachers. Morienus warns us that whoever would study this
        Art must know the other sciences, and especially Logic and
        Dialectic, as the Sages always express themselves in veiled and
        metaphorical phraseology. Theophilus says that the only way of
        apprehending the meaning of the Sages is by constant reference
        to experiment as well as reading&nbsp; [<i>Turba</i>]. He who
        bends his back over our books (says Barensus), and does not sit
        at the feet of Nature, will die on the wrong side of the
        frontier. The first great difficulty, then, is the obscurity of
        the directions found in the books of the Sages. </p>
      <p><i>Second Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second difficulty consists in the
        apparent disagreement of those who profess to exercise our Art
        at the present day. Amongst those persons are observed a great
        diversity of method, and a considerable variety even in the
        choice of their substance. The mistakes of some of the
        professors of Alchemy make men doubt the genuineness of its
        claims. </p>
      <p><i>Third Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, there are very few that actually
        possess the Stone. The pretensions of those who boast that it is
        in their possession discredit the Art in the eyes of the
        multitude. </p>
      <p><i>Fourth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expressions used by the different
        Masters often appear to be in open contradiction one to another;
        moreover, they are so obscurely worded that of ten readers each
        one would understand them in a different sense. Only the most
        ingenious and clear-sighted men have a chance of finding their
        way through this pathless thicket of contradictions and obscure
        metaphors. </p>
      <p><i>Fifth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another difficulty is the way in which the
        substance of our Stone is spoken of by the Sages. They call it
        the vilest and commonest of all things, which is found among the
        refuse in the street and on the dunghill; yet they add that it
        cannot be obtained without considerable expense. They seem to
        say in the same breath that it is the vilest and that it is the
        most precious of all substances. One man affirms that it is so
        costly that much gold will not buy it; and, on the other hand,
        Daucus tells us that we are to beware foolishly spending gold in
        the pursuit of this Magistery. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, from what has been said, we can
        see that all the names of this Stone are fictitious and
        misleading. This indeed is the constant practice of the Sages,
        as Rosinus adds, though he makes an exception of Hermes, who
        says: Know that no true Tincture is obtained except from the Red
        Stone. But most of the directions which we find in the books of
        the Sages cause us to mix the true substance with many foreign
        ingredients, and thus to mar our work. How, then, shall we, by
        considering their works only superficially, and according to
        their literal interpretation, fathom the profound knowledge
        required for the practical operations of this Magistery? If the
        base metals are to attain the fixed nature of gold, says Rhasis,
        we shall need much labour, much meditation, much patient study,
        and constant reference to the works of the Sages to the facts of
        Nature, which alone can explain them. </p>
      <p><i>Sixth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tropical expressions and equivocations,
        the allegories, and metaphors, employed by the Sages, also
        create a most serious obstacle in the path of the student. Hence
        investigation, and the practical operations which should be
        based upon it, are embarrassed at every step with doubt and
        perplexity of the most tantalizing kind. We must not wonder,
        therefore, that the students and professors of Alchemy are
        peculiarly liable to error, since it is often all but impossible
        to do more than guess at the meaning of the Sages. At times it
        would almost look as if this Art could be acquired only by the
        living voice of the Master, or by direct Divine inspiration. </p>
      <p><i>Seventh Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every other science and art is closely
        reasoned; the different propositions follow each other in their
        logical order; and each assertion is explained and demonstrated
        by what has gone before. But in the books of our Sages the only
        method which prevails is that of chaos; there is everywhere
        studied obscurity of expression; and all the writers seem to
        begin, not with first principles, but with that which is quite
        strange and unknown to the student. The consequence is that one
        seems to flounder along through these works, with only here and
        there a glimmering of light, which vanishes as soon as one
        approaches it more closely. Such is the opinion of Rosinus,
        Anaxagoras, and other Sages. </p>
      <p><i>Eighth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way in which the Sages speak of the
        vessel in which the decoction is to take place, is very
        perplexing. They give directions for preparing and using many
        different kinds of vessels, and yet in the same breath they tell
        us, after the manner of Lilium, that only one vessel is needed
        for the entire process of decoction! It is true that the words
        of the Sages about the one invariable vessel become plain as
        soon as we understand the Art, but to the beginner they must
        appear very perplexing. </p>
      <p><i>Ninth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proper duration of our Magistery, and
        the day and hour of is nativity and generation, are also
        shrouded in obscurity. Its conception, indeed, takes place in a
        single moment; here we are to notice the conjunction of the
        purified elements and the germ of the whole matter; but if we do
        not know this, we know nothing of the entire Magistery. There
        are certain signs which occur with great regularity, at their
        own proper times and seasons, in the development of this Stone;
        but if we do not understand what they are, we are as hopelessly
        in the dark as before. The same remark applies to the exact
        proportions in which the different elements enter into its
        composition. The time required for the whole operation is stated
        by Rhasis to be one year; Rosinus fixes it at nine month; others
        at seven; others at forty, and yet others at eighty, days. Still
        we know that as the hatching of a chicken is always accomplished
        in the same period, so a certain number of days or months, and
        no more, must be required for this work. The difficulty
        connected with the time also involves the secret of the fire,
        which is the greatest mystery of the Art. The day when the Stone
        will be finished may be predicted from certain signs, if they
        are only known to us, just as the day when an infant will be
        born may be predicted from the time when it first begins to move
        in its mother’s womb. These critical periods, however, are
        nowhere clearly and straightforwardly declared to us; and there
        is all the more need of care, vigilance, and attention on our
        part. </p>
      <p><i>Tenth Cause of Difficulty</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sages appear to vary quite as much in
        their descriptions of the substance from which this Stone is
        elaborated. In order to mislead the ignorant and the foolish,
        some name arsenic, some sulphur, some quicksilver, some blood,
        some eggs, some hair, some dung, etc., etc. In reality, there is
        only one substance of our Stone; nothing else upon earth
        contains it; it is that which is most like gold, and from which
        gold itself is generated, viz., pure quicksilver, that is, not
        mixed with anything else, as we shall shew further on. The
        substance of Alchemy --- though called by a perplexing variety
        of names --- is the substance of Nature, and the first substance
        of metals, from which Nature herself evolves them. Were it
        otherwise, it would be impossible for Art to imitate Nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aristotle says that the more unity and
        simplicity of subject-matter and method there are in an art, the
        more easily it is known; and when we once possess the necessary
        preliminary knowledge, his words apply with remarkable force to
        our Art. That Art would be mere child’s play, if the Sages had
        expounded it as simply and plainly as they might have done. But
        let us tell ignorant professors of Alchemy that the more
        complicated and sophisticated their methods, the more hopelessly
        at variance with the simple and all-prevailing truth of Nature.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Our Art Is Shewn To Be One, Not Only In Its Substance,
              But In All Other Aspects. The Unity Of The Philosopher’s
              Stone Is Maintained In Its Substance, And In Its Method of
              Operation, Which Admits of No Foreign Elements.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The substance of our Art is one, and admits
        of no variation or substitute, and so also the mode of our Art
        is one. The unity of our Art is proved by the fact that, thought
        the Sages exhibit considerable diversity in their methods of
        expressing themselves, yet they all understand each other. The
        very fact that Greek understands Greek, and Latin Latin, and
        Arab Arab, proves the unity of each language; and it is the same
        with our Art. Amidst the greatest apparent diversity there is a
        wonderful substantial agreement in the works of the Sages; they
        differ in words, names, and metaphors, but they agree in
        reference to things. By one way, says Lilium, by one thing, by
        one disposition is our whole Magistery accomplished. So
        Alphidius tells us that we want only one thing, viz., water,
        etc. With these sayings agree the words of Mahometh, Morienus,
        Geber, Rhasis, Solomon, the son of David, Senior, and Mundus, in
        the <i>Turba</i>, who says: Nature delights in the same nature,
        kind in kind, kind overcomes kind, kind contains kind, and yet
        they are not different kinds, or several, but only one kind,
        having within itself those properties by which it excels all
        other things. So Haly remarks in his <i>Mysteries</i>: Know,
        brother, that our whole Magistery is one Stone, which is
        self-sufficient, is not mixed with anything else, proceeds from
        one root, becomes several things, and yet again is restored to
        its unity. This one thing is described by the Sages in many
        ways, and thus it has been supposed to be many things. But such
        mistaken impression are characteristic of those who profess our
        Art without really knowing anything about it. </p>
      <p><i>Instances Against The Said Unity</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears indeed as if there were many
        roads to our Art, and not one only. Geber avers that there are
        many ways to produce one effect. The same opinion is expressed
        by Rhasis in his book on the Perfect Magistery, where he speaks
        of bodies and spirits, and their purification and divers and
        manifold composition. We answer, as before, that there is only
        one way and one substance, as shall be abundantly demonstrated
        hereafter. The words of Rhasis are indeed true, but in our
        substance body and spirits, and their purification and divers
        and manifold composition. We answer, as before, that there is
        only one way and one substance, as shall be abundantly
        demonstrated hereafter. The words of Rhasis are indeed true, but
        in our substance body and spirit are the same thing in different
        stages of development. And so, whether body or spirit, that
        which is perfectly prepared, the same is the pure and one
        Elixir. It is in like manner with regard to plurality of
        methods: food nourishes, but the stages by which this result is
        brought about are many, as every physiologist will tell you. If
        there seem to be many methods, they are all only aspects and
        subdivisions of our one method. The White Stone and the Red
        Stone, the medicine of the third order, as Geber tells us it
        should be called, are really the same thing; the White Stone is
        only less perfect than the Red. Nature, says Florus, is one, and
        if any man strays away from her guidance, he mars his labour.
        You do not require many things, but only one thing which has a
        father and mother, and its father and mother feed and nourish
        it, nor can it be distinguished in any way from its father and
        mother. From the one substance is evolved, first the White, and
        then the Red Tincture; there is one vessel one goal, and one
        method. It is true that in the books of the Sages the impression
        is conveyed as if there were many substances and many methods:
        but they only mean different aspects or stages of the same
        thing. Solution, Sublimation, Distillation, Coagulation,
        Calcination, etc., are misleading terms; the distinctions are
        logical, or verbal, rather than real. Pythagoras tells us that
        Coction, Calefaction, Dealbation, Attrition, Affusion, and
        Tinging are only different stages of the same operation in the
        fire. There are many names, but one regimen. </p>
      <p><i>The First Distinction Sheweth That This Art Is Natural and
          Divine, And That By It The Ancient Sages Foretold The Future
          Miracles of God.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Art is partly natural and partly
        supernatural, or Divine. In changing the base metals into gold
        and silver by the projection of the Stone, it follows (by an
        accelerated process) the method of nature, and therefore is
        natural. But if we consider the digestion and generation, the
        conception and origin, of the Stone, we have, in Sublimation,
        the creation of a soul through the mediation of the spirit, and
        rising heavenward with the spirit. At another stage we have the
        soul and spirit permanently fixed at the end of the Sublimation;
        and this happens through the addition of the Hidden Stone, which
        is not sensuously apprehended, but only known intellectually, by
        revelation or inspiration. Alexander says: There are two stages
        in this Art, that which you see with the eye, and that which you
        apprehend with the mind. The hidden Stone may be called the gift
        of God, and if it does not mingle with our Stone, the work of
        Alchemy is marred. Now, the same hidden Stone is the heart and
        tincture of gold sought by the Sages. In this way, Alchemy is
        supernatural and Divine, and in his Stone consists the whole
        difficulty of the Art. We have need of much faith in this
        matter, just as much as we have need of it in regard to God’s
        miraculous dealings in Scripture. It is God alone that perfects
        our Stone, and Nature has no hand in it. It is on account of
        this fact that the ancient Sages were able to prophecy: the
        influence of the supernatural Stine exalted them above the
        ordinary level of human nature. The prophecies which they
        uttered were frequently of a special; and most important
        character. Though heathens, they knew that there would come for
        this world a day of judgment and consummation; and of the
        resurrection of the dead, when every soul shall be reunited to
        its body, not to be severed from it thenceforward forever. Then
        they said that every glorified body would be incorruptible, and
        perfectly penetrated in all its parts by the spirit, because the
        nature of the body would then resemble that of the spirit.
        Bonellus, in the <i>Turba</i> says: All things live and die at
        the beck of God, and there is a nature which on becoming moist,
        and being mingled with moisture for some nights, resembles a
        dead thing; thereafter it needs fire, till the spirit of that
        body is extracted, and the body becomes dust. Then God restores
        to it its soul and spirit. Its weakness is removed, and it is
        raised incorruptible and glorious. Our substance conceives by
        itself, and is impregnated by itself and brings forth itself ---
        and this, the conception of a virgin, is possible only by Divine
        grace. Moreover, the birth leaves our substance still a virgin,
        which, again, is a miraculous event. Hence we cannot but call
        the conception, birth, and nutrition of our Stone supernatural
        and divine. Alphidius tells us that our Stone is cast out into
        the streets, raised aloft to the clouds, dwells in the air, is
        nourished in the river, sleeps upon the summits of mountains;
        its mother is a virgin, its father knows no woman. These ancient
        Sages also knew that God must become man, because on the last
        day of our Magistery that which generates, and that which is
        generated, become absolutely one; then the old man and the
        child, the father and the son, are indistinguishably united.
        Hence they concluded that the Creator must also become one with
        the creature; moreover, they knew that man was, alone of all
        created beings, made in the image of God. Plato wrote the
        Gospel, which many years later was rewritten and completed by St
        John, even as St Augustine recites in the seventh book (IX, 13)
        of his <i>Confessions</i>. Our Magistery, says Morienus, is the
        Mystery of Mysteries of the most High God, which He committed to
        His saints in Paradise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be noted that natural operations
        which lie out of the course of ordinary natural development,
        have in them a Divine or supernatural element. And the power
        which is in Nature is also derived from God. Our Magistery
        depends quite as much on Divine influences as upon the
        operations of Nature, and the succour of the artist who assists
        Nature. The change is brought about by the power of God, which
        operates through the knowledge of the artist. How difficult, how
        mysterious, how wonderful, how arduous must it then be for the
        artist to attain to so lofty a summit of spiritual insight! We
        may well call this Magistery a divine and glorious mystery,
        which transcends not only Nature, but the godlike reason of man;
        for even man cannot apprehend the mystery, except by direct
        inspiration or circumstantial oral teaching, combined with
        minute ocular demonstration. </p>
      <p><i>Here Follows The Second Distinction In Which Shall Be Shewn
          How This Art Was Invented; To Whom It Was Given, From Whom It
          Was Withheld, And Why The Sages Keep It Such A Close Secret.</i>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the ancients would have been able to
        bring to light the hidden mysteries of this Art, had not God
        Himself, the Bestower of all good and perfect gifts, first
        revealed is to His Saints that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feared His Holy
        Name. Rhasis, in his <i>Book of Three Worlds</i>, calls it the
        gift of God, Aristotle says that it was first known to Adam.
        Others affirm that it was revealed to Enoch in a vision; and
        these persons identify Enoch with Hermogenes, or Hermes
        Trismegistus. Aristotle, in his <i>Epistle to Alexander</i>,
        calls the origin of the Art one of the greatest and most sacred
        mysteries; and therefore he entreats that prince not to ask for
        more information than he gives him in the said treatise. Some
        persons indeed maintain that this treatise is a rank forgery,
        and that it was certainly not composed by Aristotle; and this
        opinion they base on internal evidence, more especially on the
        difference in style which may be observed in the book when
        compared with the other writings of the illustrious Stagirite.
        But the difference of style is sufficiently accounted for by the
        exceptional nature of the subject matter: and this epistle has
        always been attributed to Aristotle. Testimony is borne to the
        same fact also by John Mesne, and in Haly’s book on the <i>Mystery




          of Mysteries</i>. Now because this Art was revealed by God to
        His obedient servants, it is the duty of all Sages not to reveal
        it to any unworthy person. It is true that whoever understands a
        science, or art, knows how to teach it; nor would jealousy or
        envy become a wise man: but the Sages have expressed their
        knowledge in mysterious terms in order that it might be made
        known to no person except such as were chosen by God Himself.
        But though the phraseology of the Sages be obscure, it must not
        therefore be supposed that their books contain a single
        deliberate falsehood. There are many passages in the writings of
        Morienus, Geber, and others, where this charge is indignantly
        rebutted. Those for whom the knowledge of Alchemy is intended,
        will be able, in course of time and study, to understand even
        the most obscure of Alchemistic treatises: for they will be in a
        position to look at them from the right point of view. It is
        only the wise and God-fearing whom we invite to this banquet:
        let those who are not bidden refrain from attempting to cross
        our threshold. The books of the Sages are only for the Sons of
        Knowledge. The Sages, says Hermes, are not jealous of the
        obedient, gentle, and lowly student: it is the profane, the
        vicious, and the ignorant to whom they desire to give a wide
        berth. Therefore, I conjure you, my friends, not to make known
        this science to any foolish, ignorant, or unworthy person.
        God-fearing Sages, adds Alphidius, have never carried their
        jealousy so far as to refuse to unveil this mystery to men of
        their own way of thinking. But they have carefully concealed it
        from the multitude, lest there be an end of all sowing,
        planting, reaping, and of agriculture and work generally. These
        are very good and humane reasons, then, why this Art should not
        be revealed to everybody. Moreover, it is delivered to us in
        obscure terms, in order that the student may be compelled to
        work hard in its pursuit. We do not prize that which costs us
        nothing; it is our highest delight to reap some great benefit as
        the reward of our labour. Therefore, it would not be good for
        you if this knowledge were to come to you after reading one
        book, or after spending a few days in its investigation. But if
        you are worthy, if you possess energy and the spirit of
        perseverance, if you are ready to study diligently by day and by
        night, if you place yourself under the guidance of God, you will
        find the coveted knowledge in God’s own good time. Do not be
        satisfied with alteration of metals, like our modern sophists,
        but aim at transmutation; and do not suffer them to lead you
        aside with their sophistical jargon and their absurd and
        baseless pretensions. Knowledge is one, as truth is one; and let
        me add that our knowledge and our truth are both very simple and
        straightforward. If you once depart from the unity and truth of
        Nature, you are involved in the bewildering mazes of confusion
        and error. </p>
      <p><i>Observe here The Operation And Experience Of Alchemy, How It
          Calls For Constant Manual Operations, And The Teaching Of
          Experience, For The Artist To Purify The Elements, And To
          Combine Them When Purified, Etc.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our glorious Art nothing is more
        necessary than constant reference to the facts of Nature, which
        can be ascertained only by actual experiment. The dross which is
        purged off by means of the natural operation must be removed by
        the artist, if his work is to prosper. The philosopher Socrates
        directs us to seek the cold of the Moon that we may find the
        heat of the Sun, and to exercise the hands so that the laborious
        nature of the work may be lightened. Hence it is all but
        impossible, as we may learn from Geber in his Sum of Perfection,
        for a blind man, or one whose sense of touch is defective, to be
        successful in or Magistery. The experience of sight is
        essential, more especially at the end of the decoction; when all
        superfluous matter has been removed, the artist will behold an
        awful and amazing splendour, the occultation of Sol in Luna, the
        marriage of East and West, the union of heaven and earth, and
        the conjunction, as the ancients tell us, of the spiritual with
        the corporeal. In that process of cooling, as we may learn from
        the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>, Hermes, and Avicenna, the
        manifest is concealed, while that which was concealed is made
        manifest. The first operation, which is done by hand, is the
        first stage of the work, which consists in Sublimation and
        Purification. The second operation, in which the artist has
        nothing to do but look on, is the second stage of the work. Here
        the purified and sublimed substance is fixed and becomes solid.
        This operation should bring about the perfection of our
        substance. No one can exercise our Magistery in the absence of
        the practical teaching of experience, without which the most
        diligent poring over books would be useless. The words of the
        Sages may mean anything or nothing to one who is not acquainted
        with the facts which they describe. If the son of knowledge will
        persevere in the practical study of our Art, it will in due time
        burst upon his enchanted vision. The study of books cannot be
        dispensed with, but the study of books alone is not sufficient.
        There must be a profound natural faculty for interpreting the
        significance of those symbols and analogies of the philosophers,
        which in one place have one meaning and in another a different.
        For, as Morienus tells us, all books on Alchemy are figuratively
        written. By theory and practice working together, you will be
        led to the fruition of the most precious Arcanum, which is the
        greatest and most wonderful treasure of this world. If you think
        that you have understood the directions of the Sages, put your
        impression to a practical test; if you were mistaken, Nature
        will take good care to correct your error, and if you will
        follow her guidance and take her suggestions, she may, after
        several experiments, put you in the right path. Thus you must go
        on, letting theory suggest practice, until at length all
        difficulties are resolved, and your way lies plain before you.
        Meditation, says Rhasis, is of no value without experience, but
        it is possible for you to gain your object by experience without
        meditation. The practical method will a once enable you to
        detect any false or sophistical statement, and to avoid being
        infected with the folly of our modern Alchemists. You will
        never, for instance, fall into so gross a mistake as to suppose
        that our Art can change common flints into diamonds or other
        precious stones. Those who put forward such a statement do not
        seem to understand that there is here wanting that identity of
        first substance which undoubtedly exists in the case of base and
        precious metals. The products of such an art (falsely so called)
        are not diamonds or precious stones, but pieces of glass, the
        colouring matter of which is supplied from without, and not ---
        as it ought to be --- from within. Moreover, even if we really
        knew the precise nature of the first substance of precious
        stones, we could hardly produce them, because they are not
        fusible like metals. Against all such errors the practical
        Alchemist will be on his guard. It is impossible for us to
        imitate Nature in the production of substances of which we have
        only the proximate matte, and are in ignorance of the mode of
        their acting, as, for example, in marcasite, tutia, and
        antimony, of which the matter is quicksilver and sulphur; much
        less then can we imitate her in the manufacture of precious
        stones when we are ignorant in both points. </p>
      <p><i>Third Distinction, Shewing That This Art Is More Certain
          Than Other Sciences, And That It Is Noble, Brief, And Very
          Easy.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remarkable agreement of all Sages
        demonstrated that this Art is more certain than any other. There
        is amongst them a wonderful speculative and practical harmony,
        and their contradictions are only verbal and superficial. The
        whole Magistery of our Art can be learned in a single hour of
        one who knows --- which is the case with no other science or
        art. Yet one who can perform the practical operations of Alchemy
        is not yet an Alchemists, just as not everyone who speaks
        grammatically is a grammarian. Such persons still lack that
        knowledge of the causes of things which exalts the mind of man,
        and raises it to God. Hermes, in the beginning of his Book of
        Mysteries, calls Alchemy a most true and certain Art, shewing
        that what is above is like that which is beneath, and that which
        is beneath is like that which is above, etc., etc. Again, our
        Art is more noble and precious than any other science, Art, or
        system, with the single exception of the glorious doctrine of
        Redemption through our Saviour Jesus Christ. It must be studied,
        like other Arts, for gain, but for its own sake; because itself
        has power to bestow gold and silver, and knowledge more precious
        than either gold or silver. It may also be called noble, because
        there is in it a Divine and supernatural element It is the key
        of all good things, the Art of Arts, the science of sciences.
        There are, according to Aristotle, four noble sciences:
        Astrology, Physics, Magic, and Alchemy --- but Alchemy bears the
        palm from them all. Moreover, it is a science which leads to
        still more glorious knowledge; nor can there be found a branch
        of human wisdom, either speculative or practical, to equal it.
        We naturally desire, says Aristotle (de Animal. X), to know a
        little of a noble and profound science, rather than to
        understand thoroughly some commonplace branch of knowledge. Our
        Art frees not only the body, but also the soul from the snares
        of servitude and bondage; it ennobles the rich, and comfort and
        relieves the poor. Indeed, it may be said to supply every human
        want, and to provide a remedy for every form of suffering. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been set forth by the Sages in the
        most perplexing and misleading manner, in order to baffle
        foolish and idly curious persons, who look rather at the sound
        than at the meaning of what is said. Yet, in spite of foolish
        and ignorant people, the Art is one, and it is true. Were it
        stripped of all figures and parables, it would be possible to
        compress it into the space of eight or twelve lines. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Art is noble, brief, and easy. It
        requires one thing, which everybody knows. It is in many things,
        yet it is one thing. It is found everywhere, yet it is most
        precious. You must fix it and tame it in the fire; you must make
        it rise, and again descend. When conjunction has taken place,
        straightway it is fixed. Then it gives riches to the poor and
        rest to the weary. The operation is good, if it becomes first
        dry and then liquid, and what Rebis (Twothing) is, you will find
        in the practical part of this work. </p>
      <p><i>Fourth Distinction, Shewing The Error Into Which Many Fall
          Towards The End Of The Work, Namely, In The Composition Of
          Elements; What Is The Beginning Of The Work And What Is Its
          End; And How This Art Is Not For All Wise People.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to know and investigate
        natural things, and their causes; but the knowledge of
        supernatural things is proportionately still more difficult.
        Hence we must no be surprised that the mysteries of our Art are
        discovered only by few enquirers. It is not good fortune, but
        only the grace of God, joined to reason, that will ensure
        success. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many students of our Art who have operated
        naturally only, have accomplished the first part of our
        Magistery; but as the second part contains a supernatural
        element, being ignorant and incredulous, they were not able to
        perform it, and thus that which they had already done was
        neither permanent nor valuable. For there can be no permanence
        in the first part unless it be joined to the second in the same
        hour, for the second is the key of the whole work. I knew a man
        says Gregory, who began the work in the right way, and achieved
        the White Tincture; but when there was some delay about the
        appearance of the Red Colour, he gave up in despair, etc. This
        man knew the simple elements of our Art, their purification,
        commixtion, and the different signs which were to appear; he was
        ignorant only of the day and hour in which the conjunction of
        the simple elements and the completion of the work might be
        expected; and because he did not know what to do at the right
        time, the whole Magistery vanished from his sight. For the White
        Stone was net yet fixed, and, being exposed to too much heat, it
        evaporated. The permanent fixation of the Stone is the Divine,
        or supernatural department in our Art, which is performed by the
        by the composition of these simple elements together, when the
        fixed Stone retains the volatile, and they remain together
        eternally, wherein is the whole power of Alchemy, which is
        neither accomplished by Art or Nature only, but by God, the
        glorious. I do you to wit, says Lucas in The Crowd, that all
        things created are composed of four elements, and return into
        them; in these they are generated and corrupted, according to
        the will of God. It is through he shortcomings of their
        creation, as Alphidius testifies, that all things are subject to
        decay. Our Stone must have he elements so cunningly united in
        its composition that they can never thenceforth be separated.
        You need special pains towards the end of our Magistery. The
        foetus grows without any care, day by day and hour by hour, for
        nine months in the mother’s womb; but when its growth is
        completed, it needs an expulsive effort of the uterus, or else
        it must die; and something of the same kind happens with regard
        to our Stone, which, happens, though it is produced perfect in
        itself, is yet wanting in tincture fixity, and marital
        conjunction. When the hatching of chickens is accomplished, the
        little creatures often want some aid to assist them in getting
        out of the egg, and if they cannot obtain that aid they are
        choked and die. We must knows, says Rhasis, the hidden nature of
        the Stone and of its dissolution; for if you have not an
        accurate knowledge of these particulars you had better stay your
        hand at once. Let us not for a moment suppose that it will be
        profitable for us to set about this Magistery if we do not
        understand the composition of the elements. This is the part of
        our work which is supernatural, since it unites earthly to
        heavenly things, and therefore it is called Divine, celestial,
        glorious, wonderful, most beautiful, most difficult. It is an
        Art which we can know by Divine inspiration. The ancient Sages
        described the entire first part of the work as the beginning of
        the work, and the beginning of the work was with them the
        nativity and germination of the Stone, which takes place on the
        day when the coction and digestion of the substance is complete,
        and is sublimation perfect. In other words, to them the
        beginning of the work was the completion of the digestive
        process, and the digested and perfected substance itself. The
        end and complement of the work is the retaining of the Stone
        after its digestion, Now, Aristotle tells us that a slight error
        in the beginning may be a great one in the end; one mistake
        breeds a whole swarm of disastrous consequences. Hence we must
        be very careful about the first steps we take in the development
        of our substance, or we may irreparably mar our work at the very
        outset, the error becoming more and more apparent as the
        operation proceeds. The perfection of the end must be already
        germinally contained in the beginning. Whiteness is the
        beginning of our Magistery, its perfection and end is Redness;
        and the Red Tincture is germinally contained in the white. The
        spirit cannot enter the body until it is purified; but when
        purification has taken place, we may expect the permanent
        conjunction of the corporeal and the spiritual principles. So
        should the state of whiteness be anxiously looked for, because
        it is the beginning and foundation of this work. </p>
      <p><i>Here Follows The Fifth Distinction, Shewing That This Stone
          Is Like All things In The World, And That It Goes By Different
          Names. How Far Alchemy Has Anything In Common With Other
          Sciences.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Stone, from its all-comprehensive
        nature, may be compared to all things in the world. In its
        origin and sublimation, and in the conjunction of its elements,
        there are analogies to things heavenly, earthly, and infernal,
        to the corporeal and the incorporeal, to things corruptible and
        incorruptible, visible and invisible, to spirit, soul and body,
        and their union and separation, to the creation of the world,
        its elements, and their qualities, to all animals, vegetables,
        and minerals, to generation and corruption, to life and death,
        to virtues and vices, to unity and multitude, to actuality and
        potentiality, to conception and birth, to male and female, to
        boy and old man, to the vigorous and the weak, to the victor and
        the vanquished, to peace and war, to white and red, and all
        colours, to the beauty of Paradise, to the terrors of the
        infernal abyss. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the initiated it is clear that Moses,
        Daniel, Solomon, several of the prophets, and the evangelist St
        John, possessed the knowledge of this Art, it having been
        revealed to them by God Himself. These holy men did no affect
        the Art for the sake of the acquisition of gold and silver, but
        on account of its beauty and the insight which it affords into
        the things of the spiritual world.&nbsp; As our Art is touched
        upon in all other sciences, so the prophets referred to it for
        the purpose of illustrating Divine truth.&nbsp; Nor is this
        wonderful, seeing that our Art speaks of all things, both
        visible and invisible, by analogy. This remark refers not only
        to philosophy, physics, medicine, astrology, geomancy, etc., but
        is of universal application. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be asserted as a general truth that
        the verities and realities of things come first, while their
        similitudes and allegories are secondary and derivative. The
        ancient Sages, before Aristotle, was therefore greatly mistaken
        in supposing that any art or science could be taught or
        delivered to others by means of allegories and metaphorical
        analogies. Before an Art is known, it should be taught ---
        according to Aristotle, Averroes, and Avicenna --- by a plain
        and straightforward method; when it is once known, the
        allegorical method may be employed with advantage. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owing to the custom of the Sages that,
        namely, of giving an allegorical expression to their meaning,
        and carefully eschewing the plain scientific method, we have an
        infinite variety of names used to describe our precious Stone,
        every one of which may be said, in a tropical manner, to
        represent a certain aspect of the truth of our Art. So Rhasis in
        the <i>Light of Lights</i> warns us that his sayings are to be
        typically understood. The same principle may open up to us an
        understanding of the paradoxical assertion of Pythagoras --- in
        <i>The Crowd</i> --- that our Stone is found everywhere and yet
        not found; it is a stone and not a stone, worthless and
        precious, carefully hidden and yet familiarly known to all, with
        one name and yet many names. The great variety of its names is
        referred by Alphidius to the fact that in it there are analogies
        to all kinds of animals and stones, to all colours and odours,
        and all the works of men, either manual or mental. Melvescindus
        adds, that if we call it spiritual we are right; if we describe
        it as corporal, we are not mistaken; if we style it heavenly, we
        do not lie; if we call it earthly we say the truth. Lilium avers
        that our Stone has as many names as there are things, or names
        of things. Alphidius says: In our Magistery there is a great
        abundance of parables, names, and similitudes for the purpose of
        hiding the truth form the ignorant and revealing it to the wise.
        Morienus delivers himself to the same effect. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence of this great multiplicity
        of names is that our Stone has really no proper name of its own,
        by which it is generally known, except this one sufficiently
        vague and indefinite name of Philosopher’s Stone. This
        appellation being hardly sufficiently representative of the
        qualities of our Stone, each individual Sage has invented one or
        more names of his own, of which the appropriateness is patent
        only to those who are acquainted with the facts to which they
        refer. They are generally derived from some process or change of
        colour which our substance undergoes in the course of our
        Magistery. The substance indeed is one, but just as gold being
        worked up into different shapes is called by different names,
        such as ring, bracelet, crown, etc., though in substance all
        these are nothing but gold; so our one substance comes to bear
        different names derived from the changes to which it is
        subjected. In the same way as ordinary men in common parlance
        express their meaning proverbially and metaphorically, clothing
        a plain thought in figurative language, so our Sages find it
        necessary to describe this secret of secrets, and mystery of
        mysteries, in figurative terms, so that it may remain a profound
        Arcanum to the wicked, the arrogant, the profane, and all to
        whom God Himself will not permit it to be revealed. </p>

          Now Proceed to Refute the Arguments Alleged Against The Truth
          Of Our Art, At The Same Time Giving Such Illustrations And
          Explanations As May Suggest Themselves.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hoped that what has been said has
        supplied to the reader with all desirable information with
        regard to the scope and bearing of our Art. We now propose to
        say something in refutation of the arguments intended to
        discredit Alchemy in the eyes of those who suppose themselves to
        be learned. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the First Five Objections</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that, in producing gold, the Art
        of Alchemy does not pretend to imitate in the whole work of
        Nature. It does not create metals, or even develop them out of
        the metallic first substance; it only takes up the unfinished
        handiwork of Nature (i.e., the imperfect metals), and completes
        it (transmutes metals into gold). It is not then necessary that
        Nature’s mode of operation, or the proportion of elements, or
        their mixture, or the proper time and place, should be so very
        accurately known to the Artist. For Nature has only left a
        comparatively small thing for him to do --- the completion of
        that which she has already begun. Moreover, our Artists do not,
        as a matter of fact, set to work without having first
        investigated Nature’s method of procedure. Nature herself is set
        upon changing these metals into gold; the Artist has only to
        remove the cause which hinders this change (i.e., the corrupting
        sulphur), and then he can depend upon Nature for the rest. This
        matter will, however, be more clearly explained below in our
        chapters on the generation of metals. As to the brief space of
        time required for the conversion in our Art, it must not be
        thought that we bring this about by exposing metals in the
        furnace to the sudden operation of fierce heat. If we did so,
        their metallic moisture would, of course, be destroyed and dried
        up. But we only just melt the imperfect metals over the fire,
        and then add to them the Philosopher’s Stone, which, in a moment
        of time, imparts to them the form of gold, thus changing and
        ennobling their nature, conserving their own proper metallic
        humour. It would not be possible for us to evolve gold and
        silver out of the metallic firs substance; but with the help of
        our Stone, in a fire sufficient for liquefaction, preserving the
        moisture and removing the superfluity, do we generate that
        volatile Stone which we seek, to which we unite our fixed Red
        Stone, and the we can very easily hasten and facilitate an
        inward action which Nature has already set going, which alone
        has been brought to a standstill by the presence of impure
        sulphur. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a frequent cause of terror to reason
        about some particular fact or facts in vague and general terms.
        Where particulars are concerned, you ought to confine your
        syllogism to the same category, or we may be logically compelled
        to admit what we know to be nonsense. Now, if you look at the
        first five arguments directed against our Art, you will find
        that they are all couched in the most indefinite language; and,
        therefore, until our opponents discerned to matter-of-fact
        particulars, we cannot consent to regard their arguments as
        deserving of a refutation. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Sixth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our Magistery there are two things to be
        taken into account --- the action of Nature, and the
        ministration of our Art. In respect of the first consideration
        --- the indwelling natural agent --- the whole work from
        beginning to end is, of course, brought about by it, and by it
        alone: the digestion, conjunction, generation, and formation of
        our Blessed Stone are due to it. Nevertheless, there is another
        point of view, in which our Magistery may be termed an
        artificial process; without its aid the action of Nature could
        either not go on at all, or would not be accomplished with so
        great rapidity. Butte moving principle in our Art is undoubtedly
        natural, and the same must be true of its products. In a word,
        generation and combination are natural, but the ministration is
        the work of art, being in Alchemy even as in the cooking of
        food. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Seventh Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this argument of our opponents the
        conclusion is invalid because the form, which is the perfection
        of a thing, is twofold, one in so far as it is mixed, and on in
        so far as it is mixed, and one in so far as it has the principle
        of life and development, or has such a principle introduced from
        without by means of the quintessence, or in some other way. In
        the case of animate objects, the nobler part of the composition
        is often this vital principle; with inanimate objects, indeed,
        the reverse is naturally the case. For this reason we cannot
        form a lion, a goat, or a man; for though we might know the
        exact composition of their bodies, yet it is impossible for us
        ever to understand the evolution of the soul. In like manner,
        though we are familiar with the generation of some minerals,
        vegetables, and animals, yet we are ignorant of their specific
        forms. But in the generation of gold, we know the specific form
        or composition, separated from the perfectible matter, and the
        methods of perfection and conjunction, according to nature. The
        specific form of the common metals is, as a matter of fact, the
        same as that of gold and silver. There is no need for us to
        create metals; we only remove certain impurities which stand in
        the way of their development, and they then become commuted into
        gold and silver of their own accord. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Eighth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This objection is not conclusive because the
        metals, as has been said, differ not specifically, but only
        accidentally. But this objection will be more irrefragably
        refuted below, when we deal at some length with the argument
        advanced by Aristotle. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Ninth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that the generation of some
        earthly things is dependent on the influences and movements of
        heavenly bodies, for the introduction of their form, but it is
        not needful for us to know of them, nor indeed is it possible,
        except in a confused way, as, for example, in the seasons of the
        year which are caused by the movements of the sun, and determine
        the sowing and the growth of plants, with the sexual commerce of
        horses, asses, hawks, falcons, etc., which are capable of
        producing offspring only at certain periods of the solar year.
        But the rule does not apply to men, pigeons, and fowls. If we
        wish to generate worms in a putrefying body, we need not attend
        to the season of the year, but only to certain conditions of
        warmth, etc., which it is easy for us to bring about by
        artificial means. In the same way, a certain degree of equable
        warmth will always hatch the eggs of the domestic hen. The same
        principle may be observed in the generation of lime, vitriol,
        salt, and soon. To operations of this kind the heavenly
        influences appear to be always favourable; and all Sages are
        unanimous in saying that our Magistery belongs to this class,
        because it may be performed at any time or period of the year.
        It is only indispensable, says Rhasis, that all other necessary
        conditions should be properly necessary conditions should be
        properly fulfilled, and then the stellar influences will not be
        wanting. And this dictum is substantially confirmed by Lilium
        and others. So also Plato states that the celestial influences
        are poured down according t the value of the matter. Wherever,
        indeed, it is necessary to infuse a new accidental form, the
        sites, aspects, and conjunctions of the heavenly bodies must be
        carefully observed. But as the Art of Alchemy makes no demand of
        this kind, the knowledge required for such an operation is not
        needed. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Tenth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms are either natural or artificial; and
        natural forms are either substantial or accidental. The
        substantial form is that which makes a thing what it is, and
        differentiates it from all other objects of the same genus. The
        accidental form embraces all the proper manifestation of the
        substantial or specific form, such as the active and passive
        qualities of any given object, and its colour, smell, taste, and
        shape. Artificial forms are entirely accidental, and are noting
        but the shapes and qualities imparted to anything by art through
        the will of the artist, such as the shape of a house, or ship,
        or coin. Some of these artificial accidents are permanent, as,
        for instance, a house or a ship; some pass away with the act in
        which they consist, as, for instance, dancing and singing, and
        all successive actions. The generation of the Philosopher’s
        Stone is brought about through the mediation or agency of
        Nature, using the natural instrument of fire, with the natural
        colour, smell, and shape thereof, which are its accidental
        forms, following its determined substantial form, but at the
        same time by means of the artist’s aiding hand. Its form is
        necessarily natural and substantial, and is known by its natural
        accidental qualities, like everything else in the world. Some
        assistance is indeed given to the development of the inherent
        principle; but the inward agent is natural, and the form which
        is brought into existence by it is also natural, and not
        artificial, as is falsely asserted by our opponents, Hence the
        gold which is obtained by means of our Stone, differs in no
        respect from natural gold, because its form is natural and not
        artificial. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order fully to understand the refutation
        of this tenth objection, we should further consider that natural
        forms are evolved in two ways. Either Nature supplies the
        substance and works it up into a given specific form in the
        absence of any aid from without, or natural substances are
        combined and prepared in a certain way by art, and then attain
        to perfection by means of a natural operation. To this latter
        class belong most chemical compounds. Though here Nature cannot
        herself prepare and combine the requisite ingredients, yet the
        result could never be brought about by a merely artificial
        operation, and is due to Nature alone. Health is restored to the
        body by Art, but the real agent is Nature, Art only supplying
        the necessary conditions under which Nature is to work. There is
        all the difference in the world between an artificial product of
        this kind and a real artificial product, such as a house, a
        ship, and the like. Natural products admit of but little
        variety, and the gold which is produced by Nature, either in the
        one or the other of the ways indicated above, will always be the
        same gold. Hence the gold of Alchemy, which is due to a natural
        process, rendered possible and assisted by art, is evidently not
        wanting either in the specific form or the accidental properties
        of gold found in mines. The principle of art is Nature, and,
        after all, the works of Nature are the operations of Supreme
        Intelligence, and natural conditions may be established by the
        intelligent mind of the artist. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Eleventh Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our assailants say that it is easier to
        destroy than to construct. But Geber tells us that what is
        difficult to construct is also difficult to disintegrate; the
        stronger the composition of anything, the more difficult is also
        its decomposition. The making or construction of a thing may be
        considered in a twofold aspect. There is the initial development
        of a thing out of its first principles, as, for instance, the
        blood in the uterine veins of the hen, out of which the egg is
        formed; then the development of the chicken out of the egg by
        subjecting it to the warmth of the hen for a certain period,
        when all necessary conditions of this development already
        pre-exist in the egg. We may also distinguish a third operation,
        viz., the laying of the egg by the hen. The change brought about
        by Alchemy is of the second description. For in the common
        metals all the necessary conditions of gold are already found,
        just as the chicken is already contained in the egg. It is not
        the business of the Alchemist either to know or to put together
        the component elements of gold. Rather, we may say that he has
        them in an unfinished state, and commutes them into gold by a
        process similar to that which changes an egg into a chicken. The
        twelfth and thirteenth objections are already met by what has
        been advanced in our previous arguments. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Fourteenth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the fourteenth objection, which asserts
        that it is impossible that the same thing should operate in two
        contrary ways, we answer that this is true of the same thing,
        but not true of different things; and this diversity depends on
        the thing receiving rather than on the thing received. In the
        human body, for instance, the same agent changes very different
        foods into the chyme and blood of exactly the same composition
        hard food being softened and soft food hardened. Galen tells us
        that both cold and warm foods ultimately produce animal heat in
        the body. Considered as foods, all these substances are
        different, yet they are all turned to the same use by the one
        agent which we call the vital power. In the same way, the common
        metals, which are dug out of mines, differ from each other as to
        the hardness or softness of their composition, and the degree of
        their purity, etc; yet they are all subject to the same natural
        digestion and the inherent action of the same specific form is
        developing them all in the same direction. In this case, too,
        through the operation of one and the same force, the hard
        substance are softened and the soft substances rendered hard, so
        that both are reduced to one intermediate degree of consistency.
        Would it not be absurd to say, as is nevertheless asserted by
        some who are wise in their own conceits, that it is impossible
        for our Stone to change both copper or lead and iron into gold,
        because the one is hard and the other soft. It is the digestive
        power of metals, and it deals with them as the digestive power
        of the human stomach is able to deal with food. There is, then,
        as Geber says, in our Magistery only one thing which changes all
        metals into the same precious substance, viz., the Red Tincture,
        and this assertion involves no contradiction in terms, as has
        been supposed on account of the diversity of the common metals.
        This one medicine hardens that which is soft, and softens that
        which is hard, fixes that which is fugitive (or volatile), and
        glorifies them all with its own magnificent brilliancy and
        splendour. The true artist knows the causes of the hardness of
        metals, as well as of their softness, the causes of their
        fusibility, whether that process be quickly or slowly
        accomplished, and the causes of their fixation and volatility;
        he is acquainted also with the causes of the perfection of
        metals, and of their corruption, of all their defects and
        superfluities; and therefore, has all the knowledge which our
        Magistery requires and presupposes. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Fifteenth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refutation of this argument is
        sufficiently patent from what has already been said. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Sixteenth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is advanced that common metals are
        perfect in their own species, and that it is, therefore,
        impossible to bring them to any higher degree of perfection,
        just as a horse can never be perfected into a man. But there is
        such a thing as specific completeness which, nevertheless,
        admits of a higher development. An egg, for instance, as far as
        it goes, is specifically complete in itself; and yet it is not
        perfect as regards the intention of Nature, until it has been
        digested by means of natural heat into a bird. It would be
        absurd to say that an egg must always remain an egg, because as
        such it has certain well-defined properties and a substantial
        form of its own. The same holds good with regard to the seeds of
        plants, which are specifically complete as seeds, yet Nature
        nevertheless designs them to be perfected into living plants. In
        the same way, tin, lead, and iron, are perfect in their own
        species, yet in another sense are not perfect, are at once noble
        and ignoble, and still have not yet achieved the highest
        possibilities of their nature. The delay in their development is
        caused by Nature for the sake of man, because the common metals
        can be turned into uses for which gold and silver could not be
        employed. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Seventeenth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution of this difficulty is patent
        from that which has already been said. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Objections</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, too, we may partly refer the reader
        back to what has already been proved, and partly we must ask him
        to wait until we deal with the five arguments of Aristotle. </p>
      <p><i>Refutation of the Twentieth Objection</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told that the subject matter of this
        Art must be contingent and dependent upon chance rather than
        upon the strict sequence of natural causes and effects, because
        the Sages themselves admit that it has never become known to any
        very considerable number oven of its most diligent students.
        Hence it is asserted that our Art cannot aspire to be a science,
        and can never, at the very best, be more than a system of
        haphazard guess work. But it is a mistake to suppose that that
        which happens only seldom, must therefore necessarily be subject
        to chance. If our objectors only knew our Art, they would
        readily admit that it is governed by as rigid a system of
        unchangeable laws as the most exact science in the world. </p>
      <p><i>We Will Now Proceed to Answer the Five Arguments of
          Aristotle</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first, it has already been met by
        our proof that the transmutation of metals in Alchemy is brought
        about by a natural process. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same remark holds good of the second
        objection. A solution of this third difficulty has also been
        given when we proved that is not necessary for the artist to be
        acquainted with the exact composition, or substantial and
        pre-existent form, either of the common metals or of gold and
        silver, since the necessary process of change is brought about,
        not by the artist but by the inward natural principle, which
        strives to fulfill the intention of Nature with regard to it. It
        is enough to be acquainted with their accidents, properties, and
        passions, which are the consequence of their form. When any
        transmuted metal is found to have the properties and passions of
        mineral gold, without super-abundance and without deficiency, we
        conclude of necessity that it has also the form of fold. It is,
        of course, impossible, and always will be impossible, for any
        one to know things by means of their forms, because they do not
        fall within the cognizance of our senses. That which does the
        work, and performs the functions, of an eye is an eye, but
        nothing else really deserves this name; hence a stone or a wax
        eye is not an eye, but only the similitude of an eye, because it
        does not perform the functions of an eye. I affirm,
        notwithstanding, that, among composite things, the form of gold
        and the Stone of the Philosophers alone can be properly known
        through the perfect knowledge or cognition of the immediate
        matter which underlies the visible accidents, which, if the
        same, so not subtend, then is the form unknown and inoperable,
        as in other composites. There is, however, no need for us to
        know the forms of common metals; for us it is sufficient to be
        aware that all metals are in course of development into gold,
        through the properties and accidents in the immediate first
        matter, and are capable of being endowed with the form of gold.
        Whosoever is ignorant of the form in a given matter is ignorant
        of the form in a given matter is ignorant of the possibility if
        its transmutation, and must judge by his knowledge of accidents
        and qualities; and, seeing that the gold of the mine and the
        gold produces by alchemy have precisely the same properties in
        appearance, and endure the same tests, we conclude that they are
        both real gold, and are impressed with the same form, and are
        impressed with the same form. The fourth objection of the
        philosopher has already been met by what has been said above
        concerning the proportion in which the elements are mixed in any
        given thing. </p>
      <p><i>We Will now Attempt to Answer the Fifth Objection of
          Aristotle</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aristotle obliges us to confess that metals
        differ not only in their accidents, but specifically, and
        therefore his argument requires to be answered at some length.
        Now, there is this difference between potentiality and
        actuality, that the one is related to the other as non-existence
        to existence. The potential becomes the actual, the imperfect
        the perfect, and substance becomes form; but the process is
        never reversed. Seed is never potentially blood, nor blood
        potentially food, nor food potentially the four elements. Not
        everything that is changed into something else is called the
        substance of that other thing; a living body is not the
        substance of a corpse, nor wine of vinegar. In the generation of
        metals all common metals are potentially what gold is actually;
        they are imperfectly what gold is perfectly; they are
        substantially what gold is formally. This is evident from the
        fact --- which shall be proved later on --- that Nature changes
        all metals into gold, wile gold is never changed into any of the
        other metals. Hence, if our Art is to succeed it must follow the
        course of Nature, and do as it is taught by Nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be further distinguished that in
        this connection potentiality is of two kinds: disposition
        towards the form and the faculty of receiving form. The first
        may be divided into approximate, remote, and remotest. The
        second is also duplex. Now, complete goodness or perfection is
        one, and amongst the metals there is only one which is good and
        perfect, namely gold, and gold does not need to go through any
        change to make it good and perfect. To be perfect is for
        anything to have realized the ultimate intention of Nature
        concerning it; the common metals have not yet realized this
        ideal; hence it still remains for them to be changed into gold.
        And, as that which is nearest to perfection is the best among
        imperfect things, silver comes next after gold, then bronze,
        then tin, then copper, then lead, then iron --- as appears from
        what has been said above. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold alone among the metals has, therefore,
        reached the highest stage of actual perfection. All other metals
        are only potentially perfect. Some of them, however, have left
        behind the more remote grades of potentiality, and the change
        they require to undergo is inconsiderable, because their
        distance from the highest stage of metallic actuality is not
        very great. We do not affirm, with other writers, that the
        intention of Nature has been frustrated or arrested in the
        imperfect metals. We affirm that they are produced in accordance
        with her intention, and that they are in courts of development
        into gold. This operation is performed either by Nature in the
        bowels of the earth, or, in an infinitely shorter space of time,
        by our most glorious Magistery. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also three kinds of perfection and
        imperfection: --- (1) Among things which have the same
        substantial form; (2) among things which have different
        substantial forms; (3) among things which are in course of
        development into the same form. The first kind of perfection
        belongs to a man who has the complete use of all his organs,
        senses, and faculties; a man who suffers from any defect in
        these particulars is not so perfect a specimen of humanity. The
        second kind of perfection is comparative, when we place two
        things, which are complete in their own species, side by side.
        So, for instance, a man is a more perfect creature than a horse,
        and a horse is more perfect (or noble) than an ass. The third
        kind of perfection we find only amongst those things of the same
        kind which are in different stages of development towards a
        highest point. This is the species of perfection we refer to
        when we speak of metals. Each metal differs from all the rest,
        and has a certain perfection and completeness of its own; but
        none, except gold, has reached that highest degree of perfection
        of which it is capable. For all common metals there is a
        transient and a perfect state of inward completeness, and this
        perfect state they attain either through the slow operation of
        Nature, or through the sudden transformatory power of our Stone.
        We must, however, add that the imperfect metals form part of the
        great plan and design of Nature, though they are in course of
        transformation into gold. For a large number of very useful and
        indispensable tools and utensils could not be provided at all if
        there were not copper, iron, tin, or lead, and if all metals
        were either silver or gold. For this beneficient reason Nature
        has furnished us with the metallic substance in all its
        different stages of development, from iron, or the lowest, to
        gold, or the highest state of metallic perfection. Nature is
        ever studying variety and, for that reason, instead of covering
        the whole face of the earth with water, has evolved out of that
        elementary substance a great diversity of forms, embracing the
        whole animal, vegetable, and mineral world. It is, in like
        manner, for the use of men that Nature has differentiated the
        metallic substance into a great variety of species and forms. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the great process of
        development into silver and gold is constantly going on. This
        appears from the fact that miners often find solid pieces of
        pure silver in tin and lead mines, and also from the experience
        of others who have met with pure gold in metallic veins of iron
        --- though this latter occurrence is more rarely observed, on
        account of the great impurity of iron. In some silver mines,
        again, quantities of solid gold have been discovered, as, for
        instance, in Serbia; at first, the whole appears to be silver,
        but in the refiner’s crucible the gold is subsequently separated
        from the less precious metal. Thus it is the teaching of
        experience that Nature is continually at work changing other
        metals into gold, because, though, in a certain sense, they are
        complete in themselves, they have not yet reached the highest
        perfection of which they are capable, and to which Nature has
        destined them --- just as the human embryo and the little
        children are complete and perfect as far as they go, but have
        not attained to their ultimate goal of manhood. Gold is found in
        different forms, either mixed with a coarse rocky substance, or
        in a solid condition, or amongst the sand in the beds of rivers,
        being washed out of the mines by water. Golden sand is also
        found in the deserts of India, where there are no rivers. Silver
        is never found mixed with the sand of rivers, but mostly in the
        shape of ore in mines, or like a vein running through a rock.
        Lead and tin occur mostly in the shape of ore, and sometimes
        they are mingled with earth. The same facts have become commonly
        observed with regard to iron and the other metals. When
        different metals are discovered in the same mine, the less pure
        of the two will generally have a tendency to ascend and leave
        what remains more force to develop in the right direction. The
        difference between metals, then, may be called specific; but it
        is not the same difference as that which exists between a horse
        and a man; it is rather a difference of development, or of the
        degree of digestion. The common metals have the same metallic
        form as gold; but the digestion of gold is complete, while that
        of the others is more or less imperfect. Thus, there is nothing
        left for us to do except to continue the digestive process until
        gold is reached, and so finish it: there is no need for us to
        reduce the common metals to their first substance, to revert
        them to the principle of digestion, or to accomplish any other
        difficult feat of that kind. If, indeed, a horse were to be
        changed into a man, it would be necessary, by corruption and
        disintegration, to convert the lower animal form into the first
        substance, and from this first substance to evolve human seed.
        Such an operation is, of course, impossible, and to attempt it
        would be to court failure. Art, therefore, follows Nature in
        that which it would accomplish after the manner of Nature, and
        it extols Nature wonderfully, not by violating Nature, but by
        governing her. But far different is the case of metals, which
        are all naturally in a state of transition and development into
        gold. In our Art the metals are not, indeed, changed back into
        their first substance; but by the juxtaposition and influence of
        the Blessed Stone, and its subtle mingling with all, even the
        smallest, parts of the base metal, the Stone, which is the
        substantial form of gold, impresses this form on every atom of
        the lead or copper, and thereby transmutes it into gold. This
        mingling cannot take place, however, without a preliminary
        melting or liquefaction, which renders the base metal accessible
        in all its parts to the subtle influence of the Stone, and to
        the transmuting power of the transmuting medicine. The form
        which is thus introduced is not accidental, but substantial; and
        therefore, the gold which results is not artificial, but natural
        and real. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it be true, as is generally assumed,
        that all things are evolved out of the four elements, this
        theory in no way conflicts with the claims of our Art. For this
        first substance is not available for any special purpose, unless
        it has first been changed into a suitable and specifically
        differentiated form. Thus it is impossible for us to generate a
        man out of the four elements: for this purpose we must have them
        in the more specific form of human seed. But where there is
        human seed, a man may be generated from it without first
        changing it back into the four elements; rather, the digestion
        of those four elements, which has already begun, must be
        continued until the substance assumes the human form. So we
        cannot produce metals out of the four elements; we must have a
        viscous, heavy, intermediate water mingled with subtle
        sulphureous earth, which is the special metallic first substance
        --- that is, quicksilver. This substance, then, through the
        agency of the sulphur, is developed into gold, or into some
        common metal, and then into gold. In order to effect this
        ultimate change, there is no need to reduce the common metals to
        their first matter, for they already contain that proximate
        first matter, which may, by comparison, be called the seed of
        gold, which also has in itself the principle of ultimate
        development into gold. In the working of Nature there is no
        regression; we cannot change the embryo back into the seed, nor
        the seed into the four elements. The common metals are a
        substance intermediate between gold and silver, on the one hand,
        and quicksilver and sulphur on the other. Seeing, then, that the
        middle must always be nearer to the end than is the beginning,
        therefore the imperfect metals are nearer to gold than is the
        first matter; and consequently, it must be easier to obtain gold
        from the common metals than from a more remote, or less
        developed substance, like quicksilver and sulphur. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we say that the common metals are an
        intermediate substance, and represent the different stages of
        transition from quicksilver to gold, this remark must be
        understood to apply to the natural aspects of the process. As
        far as our Art is concerned, there is a difference both in the
        arrangement and in the time. Our Stone perfects the quicksilver
        of the common metals by purifying and partly eliminating their
        sulphur; and this process of digestion, which make occupy ages
        in the bowels of the earth, is accomplished by our Stone in a
        moment of tie, on account of the high degree of digestion
        possessed by our Stone. This elaborate discussion of the
        arguments for and against our Art was composed by Master Peter
        Bonus, of Ferrara, in the year of our Lord 1338. The Master was
        at that time residing in Pola, a township of Istria. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Philosophy of Alchemy</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have established the truth of this
        Art, we must see to which part of Philosophy it belongs, and how
        Art and Nature differ and agree. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three parts of Philosophy: that
        which deals with matter in motion, or physics; that which is
        concerned with matter at rest, or mathematics; and that which
        abstracts from both matter and motion, or metaphysics. Alchemy
        belongs neither to the second nor to the third of these
        departments of science; consequently, it takes its place in the
        first department, or that of physical science, for it deals with
        real being joined to motion and matter, and not with
        metaphysics, which are divine, and have regard to real being
        separated from motion and matter. Each physical science deals
        with a certain division of matter, and so does our Magistery. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science is possible by means of the fact
        that the universe is the work of an Intelligence to which or
        reason corresponds. The Divine Intelligence has subjected all
        natural and supernatural phenomena to the rule of certain laws,
        which laws our reason was created capable of apprehending, and
        this state of things is the preliminary condition of all science
        whatsoever. Our reason is either practical or speculative,
        according to the class of mundane relations with which it deals;
        and thus we have speculative philosophy, or science, and
        practical philosophy, or art. Our Magistery is speculative in so
        far as it teaches us the nature and relations of metals; it is
        practical in so far as it teaches us how to utilize this
        knowledge for the production of the Philosopher’s Stone, and the
        transmutation of common metals into gold and silver. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a department of physical science, our Art
        must deal with a certain determinate division of matter; and if
        our gold is to be identical with that of Nature, it is clear
        that our Art must follow Nature in this respect, and that it
        must be concerned with the same matter which Nature employs in
        the production of gold and silver; otherwise our gold would be
        specifically, or even generically, different from that of
        Nature. Now, according to all natural philosophers and all
        alchemists, this matter is quicksilver; consequently, Alchemy
        must be concerned in the elaboration of the same material; and,
        as no matter forms of perfects itself, but is developed and
        moulded by its own proper agent, so this quicksilver is
        digested, developed, and moulded, in Nature as in Art, by an
        inherent agent of its own which we call sulphur, and by which
        the generation of metals and of gold is accomplished. This
        sulphur coagulates the said quicksilver and digests it, by its
        inherent virtue, and by means of its own natural mineral heat.
        This process of digestion produces a given metal as an
        intermediate result, but the ultimate aim of the digestive
        process is gold. In our Art we must have the same quicksilver
        and the same digestive sulphur as that which brings about the
        perfection of metals in Nature. But the mode of action, and
        digestion, and information is different in our Art from that
        employed by Nature; while, similarly, there is a difference in
        the local and temporal conditions, but the end is identical.
        Those, then, who are at work on minerals which are no metals, or
        on vegetable or animal substances, are spending their labour in
        vain; for none of these things possess that aptitude and
        predisposition to become gold which is inherent in all metallic
        substances. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all these consideration we see that our
        Art is in perfect concordance with Nature, and that in most of
        its conditions it imitates Nature. Hence our gold is fully
        identical in every essential respect with the gold of Nature,
        and abides all the tests to which it can possibly be subjected.
        It contains no impurity of any kind, but its perfect quality is
        made evident by the examination of fire, whence it follows that
        it its gold true and natural, form for form and quality for
        quality. As a fact, it is purer and more precious even than
        natural gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now proceed to discuss the first
        principles of metals, both generally and with particular
        reference of our Art, and to the procreation and transmutation
        of metals. The student should remember that, while poring over
        the pages of Alchemistic books, he should not neglect the
        practical side of our Art, because it is practice which both
        explains the difficulties of speculative truth and corrects any
        speculative error that may happen to arise. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>The Prime Principles of Metals</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Namely, of the first substances of metals in general, and of
          their generation and mutual transmutation according to Nature;
          and how and by what methods Art can follow Nature.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All metals are proved to belong to the same
        species by their coagulation, by their one mode of commixtion,
        and by their capacity of retaining their specific properties
        both when they are melted and when they are coagulated. Hence
        their matter is one, viz., a humid and watery matter, and it is
        natural for such a substance to go on in its development till it
        is completely fixed. As water quickly evaporates over the fire,
        while the humidity of metals is capable of enduring great heat
        without evaporation, this humidity cannot be water only, but is
        water mixed with, and modified by, other elements. Moreover,
        there must be something which gives this viscous and unctuous
        water that humidity and consistency which we observe in metals,
        viz., the modification introduced by their earthly ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the generation of metals, we
        distinguish two kinds of moisture, one of which is viscous and
        external, and not totally joined to the earthy parts of the
        substance; and the same is inflammable and sulphureous; while
        the other is a viscous internal humidity, and is identical in
        its composition with the earthy portions; it is neither
        combustible nor inflammable, because all its smallest parts are
        so intimately joined together as to make up one inseparable
        quicksilver: the dry and the moist particles are too closely
        united to be severed by the heat of fire, and there is a perfect
        balance between them. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first matter of all metals, then, is
        humid, viscous, incombustible, subtle, incorporated, in the
        mineral caverns, with subtle earth. With which it is equally and
        indissolubly mixed in its smallest particles. The proximate
        matter of metals is quicksilver, generated&nbsp; out of their
        indissoluble commixtion. To this Nature, in her wisdom, has
        joined a proper agent, viz., sulphur, which digests and moulds
        it into the metallic form. Sulphur is a certain earthy fatness,
        thickened and hardened by well-tempered decoction, and it is
        related to quicksilver as the male to the female, and as the
        proper agent to the proper matter. Some sulphur is fusible, and
        some is not, according as the metals to which it belongs are
        also fusible or not. Quicksilver is coagulated in the bowels of
        the earth by is own proper sulphur. Hence we ought to say that
        these two, quicksilver and sulphur, in their joint mutual
        operation, are the first principle of metals, The possibility of
        changing common metals into gold lies in the fact that in
        ordinary metals the sulphur has not yet fully done its work; for
        if they were perfect as they are, it would be necessary to
        change them back into the first metallic substance before
        transmuting them into gold; and this has been admitted to be
        impossible. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature, then, has two ways of producing
        gold; either it changes the quicksilver at once into the
        precious metals, or it develops it first into iron, lead,
        copper, etc., and then into gold. Art follows Nature in adopting
        her second method; but as regards the first, it is impossible
        for our Art to imitate Nature. These two methods are the mediate
        and the immediate; but the mediate must come before the
        immediate before it is available for the purposes of our Art.
        Our Art thoroughly purges the common metals of all the impure
        and corrupt sulphur which they contain, so that the development
        of the quicksilver can go on unhindered. If any Artist has such
        cunning as to change back animal and vegetable substances into
        their first elements, it might be possible for him to evolve
        gold in this way: but this feat necessarily lies beyond the
        reach of human ingenuity, and, therefore, the Artist who is
        busied with animal and vegetable matter, is wasting both time,
        money, and trouble. Geber, towards the end of his chapter on
        medicines of the first order, tells us that all alterant
        medicines are derived either from quicksilver, sulphur, a
        mixture of the two, or of some things possessing their nature,
        and no change can be encompassed without their agency. For this
        reason we must depend on them, and on tem alone, for bringing
        about the conversion which we contemplate as desirable. The
        perfection of philosophical quicksilver is the purification of
        its agent (or sulphur) from all corrupting influences by means
        of our Art; and so the two together perform what each by itself
        was unable to accomplish --- because each was separated from the
        other, and hindered from doing it s work by certain deadly
        impurities. Art imitates the method of Nature in bringing about
        this purification, both in the generation of the Philosophical
        Stone and in the perfecting of metals. The exact way in which
        the purification is accomplished is different, especially
        because it is much shorter; but the principle is the same. If
        Nature did not change common metals into gold, all the efforts
        of the alchemist’s Art would be in vain. </p>
      <p><i>Now we can give a Solution of the Difficulties Suggested in
          Objections Nos. 18 and 19.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature cannot accomplish the work of our
        Art, i.e., the production of the Philosopher’s Stone. Art, on
        the other hand, cannot follow as closely as many have thought in
        the footsteps of Nature, though it accomplishes the same work of
        perfecting metals. But both Art and Nature are governed by an
        equally prevailing principle, and the results re the same in
        both cases, though there may be a difference in the intermediate
        stages of the two processes. This is our answer to the
        eighteenth objection. The answer to the nineteenth objection is
        equally obvious, because the generation of gold according to
        Nature and of this gold according to our Art is, in substance,
        one and the same process, consisting in the purification of the
        active sulphur. Though the processes preceding the ultimate
        change are different in our Art from those employed by Nature,
        the ultimate result itself is identical in both cases. Thus,
        even if the same change which is produced by our Stone could be
        produced by some other medicine, the result would sill be pure
        gold. Only this is impossible, for all Alchemy pleads aloud in
        favour of our Stone as the only possible Alterative Remedy in
        the mineral world. For there is no real connection between
        vegetable and animal sulphur, etc., and metallic or even mineral
        substances. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted that the sulphur hidden
        in the quicksilver is that which imparts the form of the gold,
        by virtue of the heat of the mineral old, and the external
        sulphur; hence the gold color, which we observe in some other
        metals, does not justify us in calling them gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, indeed, a kind of gold which has
        been made of silver, reduced to the density of gold, by some
        pretending to a knowledge of Alchemy, which also endures all the
        ordinary tests, except that it is not sufficiently soft to be
        malleable; that it is devoid of the true fusible quality; and
        that it does not absorb quicksilver with sufficient rapidity;
        moreover it is not possible to aureate metals therewith. But
        this observation shews that the ordinary tests of the assayer
        are delusive, and that there is such a thing as a substance
        which an assayer would pronounce to be gold, which yet is not
        real gold. This remark, however, does not apply to the gold of
        the alchemists, for it not only endures all the ordinary tests,
        but is like other gold in all respects whatsoever. The matter
        would wear a very different aspect if we attempted to prepare
        our Stone from some vegetable substance, because no vegetable
        substance could possible be the means of producing real gold. </p>

        <p><b><i>The Generation of Metals</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Of the First Principle of Metals in particular, and of their
          Generation according to the Intention of Nature, shewing how
          Art must follow nature in having similar outward Signs, and
          the same First Principles, in the Generation of the
          Philosopher’s Stone. Herein is contained the whole Secret of
          Nature.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If two things generally belong together, and
        if one of them is sometimes found apart, the other will also be
        sometimes found apart. For instance, that which is moved and
        that which moves form a pair; if that which is moved occurs by
        itself, that which moves must also be found by itself. We have
        seen that quicksilver and sulphur are the firs principles of
        metals, and that the former is developed by the latter. When the
        sulphur has done its work for the quicksilver, it is separated
        from it, so that the quicksilver remains by itself. It follows
        that the sulphur must also be by itself. If, at the end of the
        digestive process, the sulphur remains mixed with the
        quicksilver, the result will be one of the base metals. Art,
        following in the footsteps of Nature, takes the same substance,
        and as Nature, at the end of her work, separates off the
        sulphur, and imparts to the quicksilver in an instant the form
        of gold, leaving the sulphur on one side, so Art must, in all
        essential points, follow the guidance of Nature. When the artist
        sees the quicksilver in a separate condition, he knows that the
        sulphur is also by itself. This separation must take place if
        the Philosopher’s Stone is to be evolved, and then the substance
        will receive its form at its own proper time, as assigned to it
        by Nature. </p>
      <p><i>Note that we have here the whole Secret of Nature and the
          Art.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every solid substance, like wood, stone,
        etc., is bounded by its proper limits, because its solidity
        gives it power to retain its own shape. But water, oil, and all
        liquids are bounded by something else. So our metallic humour is
        at first bounded by something else; but when it becomes
        perfectly solid and fixed, it also is bounded by its own limits.
      </p>
      <p><i>Note with regard to the Quicksilver, etc., etc.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When quicksilver is first used in our
        Magistery, it is bounded by something else; but if we would
        retain it, we should take care to enclose it within its own
        limits, i.e., to coagulate it with its earthy parts, and not
        with foreign substances. </p>
      <p><i>Note in regard to the Conversion of the Elements.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the elements are changed one into
        another, water into earth, and air into fire. For its earthy
        parts are nothing but the hidden body of gold of the Sages, also
        called the Body, or Ferment, or Poison. Moreover, when digestion
        is complete, it is made evident by the separation of all
        superfluous and corrupting sulphur, at which point the operation
        should finish. </p>
      <p><i>Note with regard to the superfluous Sulphur, etc.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the process of digestion
        there were two kinds of superfluous sulphur, of which the first
        was subtle and combustible. By means of the evaporation in the
        sublimation this sulphur&nbsp; is separated from the
        quicksilver. But there is another gross, earthy, and feculent
        sulphur, which sinks to the bottom of the vessel, over which is
        the pure, volatile substance. For as in the digestion of must
        and blood there is separated therefrom a subtle and a gross
        superfluous substance, and the pure liquid is between the two,
        so, in our work, there is a fiery and subtle, and a gross and
        earthy, sulphureous superfluity. This separation is brought
        about by digestion or coction, supervised by Art, which prevents
        the volatile elements from escaping. So long as the sulphur
        remains joined to the quicksilver the work is imperfect, just as
        metals are imperfect under the same conditions, that is, in
        comparison with gold. This substance is the quicksilver of the
        Sages, and it permits of being united with glass; in other
        words, with its body, ferment, poison, or salt. This is that
        which imbibes glass as a thirsty ma drinks old water; this is
        the medium of union between Sun and Moon; the same is the
        electrum of Nature. It is also the fugitive slave, and blessed
        is he who can overtake him, for his nature adapts itself to all
        things. This also is called Virgin’s milk. The same substance is
        meant by all these expressions. The colour which appears when
        the first coction is complete is whiteness; then we know that
        the quicksilver is fully separated from the sulphur; hence we
        observe at this sage the brilliant splendour of the quicksilver.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should, however, be noted that the white
        colour is easily affected by all other colours in turn, seeing
        that it readily receives their nature and composition. This
        susceptibility of the white colour to even a small portion of
        some other colour may be observed in the dyeing of wool and
        silk. For whiteness is the element and foundation of all other
        colours. White substances are equally open to modifications of
        taste and scent, as, for example, the facility with which the
        insipid flavour of water may be itself changed by the addition
        of some more savoury substance. The same rule holds good with
        the simple atmospheric air, which very easily becomes
        contaminated by odours. In the case of metals this rule does not
        obtain, for a small quantity of quicksilver whitens a large
        portion of gold or copper. </p>
      <p><i>Note as Regards the Digestion of Quicksilver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When by means of our alchemical digestion we
        obtain quicksilver from the principles of the metals, then is
        manifested a full and homogeneous whiteness, but we must take
        care to remember that the orange colour of gold, and the final
        redness, are both hidden beneath this whiteness. The same will
        persist will persist till the quicksilver has been overcome,
        after which the orange and red will replace it. The quicksilver
        assimilates everything else to its own colour, so long as it is
        in a liquid state; but its colour is changed as soon as it is
        coagulated. It is coagulated by the perfecting agent within
        itself, i.e., that divine sulphur, which appears white so long
        as the quicksilver is liquid, but imparts to the quicksilver its
        own red colour as soon as it is coagulated. This divine sulphur
        is of the nature and form of the Sun (gold), while the
        quicksilver is of the nature of the Moon (silver). When these
        two waters are combined, coagulation takes place with a colour
        of the whiteness signifies the eternal peace and concord of the
        elements, and the accomplishment of the Great Work of Alchemy. </p>
      <p><i>Two Secrets: Bow far also Art is more Sublime even than
          Nature.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hereby two secrets are revealed to us in our
        Art. The first is the mode of operation; the second is the
        material, which is so secret, that, though it be very clearly
        described, men cannot find it. In Nature there is only one
        coction; but as it is necessary to elicit from the white matter
        the red colour which lies hidden beneath, it is necessary also
        to have two magisteries, coctions, or digestive processes, in
        our Art. A mistake is often made in attempting to imitate too
        closely the exact methods of Nature, instead of following the
        great principles of Nature only. The form of gold must be
        imparted to common metals from within, by development, and not
        from without, by infusion. Those metals which have a larger
        admixture of sulphur, partake more of the nature of sulphur,
        while those which have a larger admixture of quicksilver,
        partake more of the nature of quicksilver. But as sulphur does
        not mingle with gold, the substance of gold must consist
        entirely of quicksilver; and since the Philosopher’s Stone is
        the form of gold, and is required to inform the other metals, it
        must be generated from quicksilver alone. The form of a thing is
        more noble than the thing itself, and our Stone is, for this
        reason, more precious than gold. For the form is that which
        makes a thing what it is. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Form and Matter we obtain a Compound; this Matter is
          Quicksilver and the Common Metals, and the Compound is Gold.</i>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of our Magistery is the form of
        gold. This form by itself would be nothing, because it is unable
        to manifest its virtues and operations, unless it be combined
        with some matter, and form a compost therewith; but as it is the
        form of gold which makes gold what it is, so when our Stone
        impresses itself upon any common metal, it subtly pervades it
        with the said form of gold in every smallest part, or, in other
        words, turns it into gold. Here the substance is quicksilver and
        the common metals, the form is our Stone, and the resultant
        compound is gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus there is only one Stone, both white and
        red, as all Alchemy testifies; for as the form of all
        individuals of the same species is one and the same, it follows
        that the form of gold is the same, and that there can be only
        one Stone, because Alchemy sets itself to turn all metals into
        gold. Notice also that in most metals you find neither
        quicksilver by itself, nor sulphur by itself, but a mixture of
        the two which has the power of development into gold. This is
        the metallic First Matter, and only an ignorant person will look
        for it in the vegetable or animal world. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Epilogue and Conclusion</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Shewing why the Philosopher denied this Art, and how he
          subsequently admitted the Secret of Gold-making.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his fourth book of <i>Meteorology</i>,
        Aristotle explains why he apparently denied the truth of
        Alchemy. It was this form, he says, which induced the ancient
        Sages to speak of a form apart from its substance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He alludes to the Platonists and
        Pythagoreans, who spoke of forms or ideas as if they existed
        somewhere in the air, apart from their concrete manifestations,
        and were imparted from without to combinations of matter
        disposed in a certain suitable way. This view is opposed by
        Aristotle, though it seems that Plato spoke figuratively, and
        was thinking of the operation of our Stone. In the passage which
        we have quoted, Aristotle certainly appears to understand him in
        that sense. But in his Metaphysics, Aristotle was anxious to
        uphold his own view with regard to forms in general, and
        therefore he spoke as he did. He opposed Plato according to the
        literal sense of his words; but he never for a moment intended
        to assail their occult and mystical meaning. In his old age the
        secret became known to him, and therefore he recanted in his
        last work the opinion which he had apparently set forth in his
        earlier writings. When he wrote against our Art he was a young
        man, and was reasoning in a general way; but in his old age he
        gave the deliberate verdict of his experience, and spoke from
        particular knowledge. No one is really qualified to pass
        judgment upon any art or science who knows nothing about it, and
        is only reasoning from general or universal premises: for
        nothing is more deceptive than such reasoning, and there is no
        more frequent or fruitful source of error. Moreover, the opinion
        of an old man is infinitely more valuable than the haphazard
        talk of youth, since young men --- according to Aristotle
        himself --- are not wise, while wisdom is an attribute of old
        age. As an old man, Aristotle agreed with the ancient Sages, and
        was heartily willing to admit that this Art is true, and
        according to Nature, as he has set forth at length in his <i>Epistle




          to King Alexander</i>. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>A Demonstration of Alchemy After Another Manner.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Here follow the reasons shewing, by a different method from
          that employed above, that the Art of Alchemy is true, and that
          the Gold of the Stone is purer and more perfect even than
          Natural Gold.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gold and silver produced by our Art are
        better and purer than those developed in the ordinary way,
        because alchemical gold is perfectly purged of all sulphureous
        dross, while natural gold is still blackened, corrupted, and
        rendered more perishable by the presence of a sulphureous
        remnant, for which reason also it is somewhat diminished in the
        fire. Natural gold is still capable of a higher degree of
        perfection, but out gold is the highest perfection of the
        metallic substance. Art might give to gold a more intense
        colouring than Nature, but refrains from going so, in order not
        to transcend the bounds of Nature. If the artist knows the two
        first substances employed by Nature, and Nature’s mode of
        operation, it will also be possible for him to elaborate real
        gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we will mention the chief reason which
        prove that our gold is, to say the least, as good as the gold of
        Nature; these arguments will also establish the truth of
        Alchemy, and its claims. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every undigested thing capable of digestion,
        and every impure thing capable of purification, can be digested
        and expurgated. Now this is the case with iron, lead, copper,
        tin, etc.; consequently, they can be completely digested, and
        for any metal to be perfectly pure and digested is to be gold or
        silver; hence all metals can be changed into gold. As in every
        digestion there is some superfluity, it must be separated from
        the substance by means of digestion, because heat brings
        together things homogeneous and separates things heterogeneous.
        Outward heat aids the inward or natural digestive heat, and in
        this way the digestion is accelerated and perfected--- as food
        is better digested if the inward animal heat be aided by warm
        baths. In the case of fruits, we see that when there is a
        deficiency of outward heat, they are not properly ripened. This
        want of inward heat we meet with him in all metals except gold;
        and, in comparison with gold, this is true even of silver.
        Complete digestion is also called optesis or elixir, while its
        opposite is described by Aristotle as scatesis or assation. In
        the case of assation the inward heat is not so completely drawn
        out by means of moisture as in the case of those metals which
        are subject to optesis. By digestion, or optesis, as the
        philosopher informs us, a new metal is formed out of common
        metals, because the digestion of the substance is now complete.
        That which begins to generate by means of digestion, must also
        complete what it has undertaken by means of digestion, because
        it is the same agent which predisposes to a certain form and
        imparts the form itself, This agent is Nature, either by
        herself, or with the aid of Art. Do we not see lead, and gold,
        and all metals, generated by nature in mines out of their first
        principles, viz., quicksilver and sulphur? But this generation
        is not brought about without a transitional substance
        intermediate between the softness of quicksilver and the
        malleable hardness of the metals. This intermediate substance is
        coagulated, but not purified, and according to the different
        conditions of digestion, time, place, quality, etc., becomes
        either gold, or a common metal with a predisposition to be
        developed into gold. This intermediate matter is that on which
        our Art sets to work; and it strives to purify and digest it
        into the form of gold, which can change all other metals into
        that precious substance, Thus the digestion of our Art is
        different not in kind but in degree, place, and time, from that
        of Nature, being as much more perfect as the form of gold is
        more perfect than gold itself. But if our digestion, and our
        place, or artificial organ, are at least equal in power to those
        of Nature, it is clear that the Art of Alchemy is possible, as
        far as the conditions of place and digestion are concerned.
        Moreover, our Art must attain better results than Nature,
        because it can bring a well-regulated supply of outward heat to
        bear on the material, and this outward heat powerfully aids the
        inward action. But the very question whether our Art is able to
        change back gold into one of the common metals is absurd:
        certainly Nature never attempts anything of the kind. Nor does
        our Art endeavor to change one imperfect metal into another,
        since for such a course there is no precedent in Nature. We
        might indeed change each imperfect metal into the next higher,
        as Nature may be supposed to do, if we only knew the exact
        mixture of quicksilver and sulphur required for such a purpose;
        but as we do not, and shall never know, we can only change
        imperfect metals into gold, in which, as we are aware, there
        must be a total absence of impure sulphur. It is quite possible,
        however, as Geber says, that this change of one imperfect metal
        into the one next above it may sometimes take place
        accidentally, through the failure of an attempt to commute them
        into gold. Another difficulty is propounded by those who fully
        admit the possibility of imitating the digestive process by
        which Nature effects the transmutation of common into precious
        metals; but as Nature requires so many years for that purpose,
        they do not see how our elixir can bring about the change in a
        moment in time. We answer that the digestion of gold and of our
        elixir are alone complete; but whereas gold is a compound, and
        is only sufficiently digested for its own purposes, the elixir
        is the form of gold, and its digestion suffices not only for
        itself, but is so exuberant, and capable of such indefinite
        multiplication, as to make up in a brief space of time for what
        is wanting in the common metals. The digestion itself does not
        take place in a few moments, but has been brought about by the
        preparation of the Elixir in our Magistery, and is now simply
        transferred to the common metal in a few moments; moreover, we
        must not forget to reckon the amount of digestion which has
        already taken place in the common metal. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it be further objected that
        quicksilver is not half digested like the other metals, but
        quite crude and undigested, we answer that all the perfection of
        metals consists in their quicksilver, and that when common
        metals are perfected, they are cleared of all corrupting
        sulphur, and only their quicksilver is perfected into gold; as
        soon as the quicksilver is thus purified, it is of the same
        nature with the elixir, and can receive some of its exuberant
        digestion. It is thus very well possible for our Art to imitate
        Nature in the generation of gold and silver. The whole process
        is admirably illustrated by Aristotle’s remarks in regard to
        atramenta, in the fourth chapter of his Meteorology, and we
        cannot do better than refer the learned reader to that passage.
        We are here at least convinced that there is no natural process
        which Art cannot imitate by simply following in the footsteps of
        Nature and assailing itself of every short cut which may be
        digested by the opportunity of the case. The chief reason why it
        is not so easy for Art to imitate Nature lies in the fact that
        it is difficult to find the first substance employed by Nature,
        as Aristotle says in this first book on Heaven and the World.
        The want of material is the chief cause in anything why
        something like it is not generated. Hence, if Art is to generate
        the same things as Nature, it must succeed in discovering the
        exact substance with which Nature works, and must then deal with
        it according to Nature’s methods. Since, then, our Art has found
        the substance of gold and silver, it is proved to be possible,
        as far as the substance is concerned. And as our Art possesses
        also the form of gold and silver, and the combination of the
        substance and form of anything will produce that thing, it is
        clear that the Art of Alchemy must possess the secret of
        producing silver and gold. Moreover, the substance of anything
        is never found by itself, but always in combination with its
        form. From this very fact it would follow that if alchemists are
        really in possession of the substance of our Stone, they must
        also be able to evolve its form. It is, then, the business of
        the alchemist to consider the form of metals, both perfect and
        imperfect, and the two are ultimately found to be both the form
        and the substance of gold. The proper method of procedure in the
        proper substance causes the generation of the form in that
        substance. The substance of common metals is the same as that of
        gold; if, then, the form of gold, or the elixir, be added to
        them, they must become gold. As the common metals become gold
        and silver by means of a natural process, it is quite possible
        that the same result should be brought about by means of the
        alchemist’s art. </p>
      <p><i>Second Argument</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever has the same causes as some other
        thing, has also the same accidents, or, in our case, the same
        composition. Now, the causes of all metals are the same,
        consequently they all have the same composition. For their
        matter, their form, and their ultimate destination are the same.
        They are all equally fusible and malleable, which is not the
        case with any other substances, and shews that they are all
        destined to the same ultimate form. There are some substances
        which resemble metals in all other respects, but are wanting in
        these two qualities. </p>
      <p><i>Third Argument.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things which agree in matter are easily
        changed into each other; now metals answer to this condition,
        consequently they are mutually transmutable. The reason why they
        are easily changed into each other is that they are all not very
        remote from their common first matter, which admits of division
        into the four elements. Moreover, they all consist of the same
        matter, viz., quicksilver and sulphur, which again facilitates
        their mutual transmutation. Amongst metals there is only one
        that is quite perfect, and represents the highest stage of
        metallic completeness, namely, gold, and all the others have a
        predisposition to be changed into it. Hermes Trismegistus says
        that the inter-generation, transmutation, and conversion of the
        metals is like that of the elements. If, then, elements are
        changed into each other, though each is perfect in itself, how
        much more must this be the case with metals which are all,
        except gold, in a state of transition towards a more perfect
        state, especially as metals all have the same matter digested in
        the same way, which is by no means the case with the elements.
        Again, when two metals are mixed, the compound still retains all
        the metallic accidents and properties; but this remark does not
        hold good with regard to the elements; for their compounds
        differ very considerably from their simple essences; nor to they
        mix their simple essences; nor do they mix so easily as metals.
        Thus it is patent to everyone that the metals must all be
        classified together, for they only represent different stages of
        the same thing. The reason that Art imitates Nature is that
        Nature is governed by a Supreme Intelligence, which has its
        earthly counterpart in the human Reason, the presiding genius of
        our Art, as of all Arts. Art brings about new natural
        conditions, which are not found in Nature, and thus achieves
        wonders which Nature cannot, or, at any rate, does not,
        accomplish. </p>
      <p><i>Fourth Argument</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever is in an intermediate stage of
        development towards something may become that something if its
        development be not hindered, or if the hindrance be removed. But
        the imperfect metals are in this state, consequently, etc. An
        intermediate substance may much more easily attain to perfection
        than a first substance; for it is already nearer to the final
        stage of perfection. Aristotle says that there are two ways in
        which one thing may be developed out of something else; either
        that thing may be in an intermediate stage, and attain to
        perfection, e.g., a man may be developed out of a boy, or one
        extreme may pass into another extreme, e.g., water may become
        air. The former change is more naturally accomplished than the
        latter. </p>
      <p><i>Fifth Argument.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly and lastly, whatever is on the way
        towards a certain goal may naturally be made to attain that
        goal; this is the case as regards common metals in respect to
        gold; consequently, they may be developed into gold. His
        proposition is clearly established by the fact that all metals
        are potentially gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These reasons, which prove the truth of
        Alchemy, may be deemed sufficient. As to the rest, it is far
        easier to forge arguments against anything than to prove the
        falsity of those arguments, especially in dealing with such a
        mysterious Art as that of Alchemy. </p>

        difficulties, and apparent contradictions, that we are apt to
        wonder, after a time, at the youthful rashness and foolhardiness
        with which we began the study. But in the following chapters we
        hope to set all difficulties at rest. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter I.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>The Matter of the Philosopher’s Stone. The Matter of the
            Metals, and its Causes, Properties, and Qualities.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great Geber tells us that metals are
        substantially composed of quicksilver and sulphur; though
        sulphur is their active principle rather than part of their
        substance. Their differences are generally traceable to a
        difference in the sulphur, which is found white, yellowish, red,
        saffron-coloured, green, and black, while the quicksilver,
        considered by itself, is always the same. Sometimes, indeed, the
        quicksilver has an earthy appearance, but this is owing to an
        admixture of lead, and can be remedied by a process of
        purification. Now, as sulphur, which is the proper coagulum of
        quicksilver, varies in its colour, while quicksilver is always
        white, it follows that the quicksilver receives its colour from
        the sulphur, and the sulphur causes the peculiar colour of the
        different metals. Everything else that is found in metals is
        more or less immature, and does not really belong to them. It
        should be noticed that, when metals are mixed, the quicksilver
        readily combines with quicksilver, because it is the same
        substance in all metals. But this cannot be said of the sulphur,
        because it is not the same in all metals. </p>
      <p><i>Note.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, fixed sulphur retard the fusion and
        liquefaction in metals, and entirely prevents it where its
        quantity exceeds that of the quicksilver. The latter is the case
        in iron, and the said metal is, therefore, not fusible. This
        fact we are taught by experience, for when we desire to make
        fixed sulphur, we must calcine it, and that which is calcined is
        not susceptible of fusion. But sulphur which is not fixed
        accelerates fusion, as we see in the case of <i>arsenic</i>,
        which is of the nature of sulphur, and brings about the fusion
        of red-hot iron. That it is sulphur which prevents fusion, we
        see from the fact that when miners smelt ore, there ascends a
        sulphureous vapour before fusion takes place, and if we collect
        this substance in a vessel, it is found to resemble <i>orpiment</i>.
        But both its smell and its properties shew that it consists
        largely of sulphur. In the same way, fixed sulphur is said to be
        the cause of the hardness of metals, as we see in iron and
        brass. Therefore, also, sulphur, which is not fixed, on the
        other hand, is the cause of metallic softness, and of
        volatilization under the test of fire, as we see in lead and
        tin. But quicksilver, whether fixed or not, is the cause of
        metallic fusion. Whatever substances are fused with great
        difficulty are quickly coagulated (on account of the sulphur
        which they contain) and vice versa. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulphur easily adheres to iron and brass,
        and readily mingles with silver, which has a proportion of
        combustible sulphur, and also with lead, the latter because lead
        contains may parts of sulphur which is not fixed. It does not
        mingle well with tin because of the large quantity of
        quicksilver which the latter contains. With gold it does not mix
        at all, because gold is purged of all its sulphur. Quicksilver,
        on the other hand, enters gold very readily, as it also does
        silver, and --- in a lesser degree --- tin and lead, because of
        the large quantity of undigested quicksilver contained in
        them.&nbsp; Brass will receive it with difficulty, and iron not
        at all, except by an artifice. To tin it adheres on account of
        its undigested sate, and on account of its large quantity of
        quicksilver. To gold it adheres most easily of all, because gold
        abounds in quicksilver. The fixed fusible quicksilver, then, is
        the cause of perfection in metals, and the less fixed it is, the
        further it is from perfection. Sulphur, on the other hand,
        whether fixed or volatile, is the cause of corruption and
        imperfection, so long as it remains in metals. Hence, we
        conclude that our noble Stone consists of quicksilver
        exclusively without any trace of external sulphur. This we see
        from the fact that quicksilver takes to nothing in the whole
        world more kindly than to gold; nothing, on the other hand, is
        more unlike gold than sulphur. Whoever denies that quicksilver
        is the true substance of metals, is like one who says that snow
        is not white. And because the Stone must enter the metals in all
        their parts, it is clear that it must consist entirely of
        quicksilver. Our assertion is borne out by the authority of
        Rhasis, Alphidius, and Geber. Rhasis, in his <i>Seventy
          Precepts</i>, affirms that Mercury is the root of all things,
        it only should be prepared, and from it is derived a good
        tincture, and a strong and conquering impression. Alphidius
        declares, on the evidence of all the Sages, that the work of
        wisdom consists solely in quicksilver. So also Geber says, in
        his chapter on the procreation of iron: Let us raise the
        Blessed, Glorious, and most High God, Who created quicksilver,
        and gave it a substance, and imparted to is substance properties
        which no other substance on earth can possess. It is the
        perfection of our Art, it is our victory which overcomes fire,
        and is not overcome by it, but delights in its heat, and gently
        and amicably reposes in it, etc. Though in his book on <i>The
          Coagulation of Mercury by Precipitation</i> he says that this
        medicine is elicited from metallic bodies with their sulphur and
        <i>arsenic</i>, he really means the same thing, but he expresses
        himself somewhat obscurely. We do not, however, need the
        testimony of the ancients to convince us that quicksilver
        without external sulphur must be the substance of the Stone,
        which, as has been said, is the form of gold. The fact is
        brought home to us with sufficient force by the evidence of our
        eyes, if, indeed, we have ever observed the facility and
        amicable readiness with which quicksilver joins itself to gold.
      </p>
      <p><i>Query: Is Sulphur a material part of Gold and of our Stone?</i>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it may be objected that our argument
        proves too much, and that sulphur must actually form a material
        part of gold and of the Stone of the Philosophers. If
        quicksilver must be the matter of the Stone, because it readily
        unites with gold, we may say with quite as much justice that
        sulphur must form part of this matter, because it very easily
        mingles with quicksilver, and especially because sulphur is the
        proper coagulum of quicksilver. If any one, says the philosopher
        Aristotle, would coagulate quicksilver so as to change it into
        gold or the Stone, he must do so by means of sulphur, for
        whenever sulphur is withdrawn from the quicksilver it becomes
        liquid as before; unless, therefore, the sulphur remain
        permanently with the quicksilver, it cannot become gold of the
        Stone. Moreover, quicksilver is white, and the Stone is
        universally admitted to be red --- hence sulphur must form part
        of its substance. Yet we answer as before, that quicksilver
        alone is the whole material cause, and the whole substance of
        the Stone. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should, however, know that quicksilver
        in its first creation has many parts of an earthy, white,
        sulphureous matter mingled with it, which are most subtle and
        belong to its own material substance, and without which it would
        have no consistency. These particles cause first its white and
        then its red colour in the operation of the magistery. Thus
        Aristotle calls quicksilver a water mingled with a certain
        subtle sulphureous earth. A hint to the same effect is thrown
        out by Geber in his chapter on the nature of quicksilver. There
        is an inward sulphur as well as an outward, he tells us, and
        this internal sulphur forms part of the substance of the
        quicksilver, and is the true agent in coagulating it. At least,
        both are not fixed, and both are instrumental in coagulating the
        Mercury. But when the quicksilver with is own inward sulphur is
        mixed and coagulated, and has received from it either the white
        or red colour, then the external sulphur can no longer combine
        with it, because they have become dissimilar. Hence it may be
        urged that it cannot form part of the substance of our Stone. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we come upon the great secret of our
        Art, that quicksilver is coagulated, not by mixture with
        anything else, but is both coagulated and coloured into
        perfection by its own internal sulphur, while it is coloured and
        coagulated to corruption by external sulphur. If the quicksilver
        could be coagulated by any other substance, whether mineral,
        vegetable, or animal, it would be a foreign coagulum, and the
        coagulation would not be that which we require. We see, then,
        that this external sulphur, though it be active in metallic
        generation, cannot itself form part of the substance of our
        Stone; and the task before us is to get the quicksilver by
        itself, and to coagulate it without the contaminating influence
        of the outward sulphur, since that which generates cannot be
        part of the substance generated. </p>

        <p><b><i>Chapter II.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>Explains the Dictum of the Ancient Sages that "Sulphur
            alone is the matter of the Stone and of Gold".</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who superficially skim the writings of
        the sages might arrive at the conclusion that sulphur alone is
        the substance of our Stone. So Rosinus says that incombustible
        sulphur, which has prevailed against fire, is that which the
        Sages are in search of, and, elsewhere, that no tincture can be
        obtained except through pure water of sulphur. Again, the
        precious colour of the philosophers is derived from sulphur. So,
        also, Solomon, the son of David, calls sulphur the Stone which
        God has placed above all other stones, which is prized by those
        who know it, and thought vile by the multitude. Bulus, in the <i>Turba





          Philosophorum</i>, asserts that the pure water is obtained
        from sulphur, yet not from one sulphur only, but from several
        things which make up one sulphur. And Anaxagoras exclaims: "Know
        that the perfection of this work is the water of sulphur". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this question we, nevertheless, answer,
        as above, that the perfection of our Magistery consists in
        quicksilver alone, which contains in its composition dry
        sulphureous particles, which tinge and colour it white in
        actuality, and red in potentiality, and are that which gives to
        it perfection and form. But, as this internal sulphur cannot be
        active without some outward impulse, Nature has added to it, in
        all metallic ore, a certain external sulphur which stirs it into
        action. Our Magistery, of course, imitates Nature in this
        respect. Because of this inward sulphur, which coagulates the
        quicksilver, and forms part of it, and is unknown to the
        multitude, the ancient Sages have spoken of quicksilver as
        sulphur, and this hidden sulphur is made manifest in the
        Magistery of our Art by a grand artifice. Our sulphur, say they,
        is not the sulphur of the multitude, because common sulphur
        burns with a black smoke and is consumed; but the sulphur of the
        Sages burns with a white smoke and is perfected thereby. It is
        this sulphur which whitens and imparts the red colour, and
        coagulates and perfects the quicksilver into the substance gold
        in nature, and of the Philosopher’s Stone in our Art. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be observed that, as everything is
        composed of matter and form, and is what it is by virtue of its
        form, a thing has the more being to more it possesses of the
        form. Quantity does not enter into the definition of form, since
        quantity and passivity belong to matter. When the substance is
        small in proportion of the form, there is much activity, much
        virtue, with great intensity of being, because there is
        proportionately much form. Concentrated force is more powerful
        than that which is divided. If this be so, we may say that, as
        the red luminous sulphur hidden in the quicksilver is the form
        of gold, it is that which tinges and transforms every kind of
        metal into gold. For this reason, the tincture is said to be
        derived rather from the quality and form, or sulphur, than from
        the quantity, or quicksilver. The intense redness thereof
        approaches black, or the colour of liver and of aloes, as
        declared in the Book of Three Words. Since one part of it tinges
        and forms a thousand parts of any metal into gold, according to
        the concensus of the philosophers, it must have much strength, a
        concentrated entity, and much form, or, rather, itself is the
        pure form of gold. Hence, on account of its redness, its
        operation can be extended to a great quantity of any kind of
        metal, so as to tinge and perfect it into gold. When the Stone
        is brought into loving contact with common metals, it purges
        away the external corrupting sulphur; thus they become white,
        and of the nature of pure quicksilver, and the form of gold
        being added to its substance, of course they become gold. This
        tincture, by means of which the perfecting process is brought
        about, is the sulphur of the Sages, the divine sulphur, and the
        Stone of the Philosophers, the secret sulphur with which all
        things are aureated and beautified. It is the precious substance
        which the sages call by so many mysterious names; the Shadow of
        the Sun, the coagulum of quicksilver, that which flies with
        tings flying and rest with things at rest, the gold of the
        philosophers, that which is sought of many and found of few, the
        Quintessence, the salt of armonia, the Vinegar of the Sages, the
        Golden Tree, of whose fruit whosoever eats shall not hunger
        again; that which is nourished and generated in the fire, and
        delights in it as in its native element; that which, like man,
        is a microcosm or little world. It is the second sulphur which
        is joined to the first sulphur, producing a third sulphur, of
        which it is said that sulphurs are contained in sulphurs. </p>
      <p><i>Note Concerning the Water and the Oil of Sulphur.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water of sulphur, or oil of sulphur, is
        quicksilver extracted from this composite sulphur. It is a
        living water, and that which the Sages call the Virgin’s Milk,
        the pure, heavenly, and glorious water. It is sometimes referred
        to as the flying bird, which is substantially identical with the
        said sulphur, but diverse from the vulgar kind. </p>
      <p><i>Is Sulphur alone the whole material of Gold?</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have said that gold is a substance
        which is digested in the bowels of the earth out of a most pure
        orange-coloured sulphur alone, with an admixture of quicksilver
        just sufficient to give it brightness and malleability. But they
        say that gold receives from sulphur its substance, colour,
        fusibility, and all the rest of its proper accidents. We answer
        that the ancient sages had some good reason for connecting each
        of the seven metals with one of the seven planets, as the
        heavenly influence from which it derived its peculiar
        properties. Thus, lead was assigned to Saturn, tin to Jupiter,
        iron to Mars, gold to the Sun, copper to Venus, silver to the
        Moon. But to Mercury they assigned no metal, because only these
        six have attained to coagulation, with fusibility and
        malleability. In the seventh place, however, they did place
        mercury, not as a metal, but as the First Matter of all metals.
        If they had thought that this place belonged to sulphur, they
        would have associated sulphur, and not Mercury, with the seventh
        planet. Hence, it must be concluded that quicksilver, and not
        sulphur, is the origin, matter, and substance of metals. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question now arises as to what Aristotle
        meant by refusing to identify the material of a thing with its
        form, as was done by the Platonist and the Pythagoreans. It is
        clear from his words that he did not take the meaning of the
        ancient Sages. The material of Alchemy --- the first matter, or
        chaos, according to the ancients, is that in which everything
        exists in a confused state, i.e., the quicksilver of the Sages
        in its primary condition, generated by a kind of preliminary
        digestion. This is the Stone which they seek, concealed from the
        senses, but manifested to the mind, the form and flower of gold.
        The knowledge of this material is more important than anything
        else in Alchemy. For it opens up the knowledge of all other
        causes, properties, and conditions, and, finally, of the form
        itself. But if we do not know the right material, it is simply
        impossible for us to know anything about it. Hence, this
        question: What is the material? --- must be the first problem
        solved by the student of Alchemy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This material is, of course, by its very
        nature, disposed to receive its own proper form, just as the
        grain of wheat has in it the disposition to become wheat. Thus,
        if we define matter as that in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which the form
        inheres, there is, after all, not so much difference between
        material and form, but that, in our Art, at least, we may
        confidently identify them. There could be no such thing as a
        substantial form, if there were no material possessing a
        capacity of being developed in a certain direction. If anyone,
        then, would know the form of gold, he must first know the
        material of the Stone. Hence, we see that real insight into the
        nature of a thing depends on an accurate knowledge of its
        material. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter III.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>We must now proceed to enquire what are the Elements of
            the Stone, and how they are the same in Gold as in all
            Composite Substances, not only on Earth, but also in the
            Heavens.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We affirm that all elements of the Stone
        must be first purified, and then evenly mixed in the right
        proportions, so that the resultant compound may be permanent.
        Hence it is necessary to say something about the elements. There
        are many persons at the present day, even as there were some in
        the past, and will be others in the future, so long as
        investigators abide by the literal words of the Sages, who know
        not the meaning of our Art, and are endeavoring to extract the
        Philosopher’s Stone from all sorts of fantastic animal and
        vegetable substances. These substances they have subjected to al
        the processes described in our orthodox treatises. And have
        obtained in the end something white, and something red, which,
        however, have none of the blessed properties of our Stone. These
        persons do not know that every form must be extracted from that
        proximate matter in which it is potentially contained; that is
        to say, the material and the form must both belong to the same
        natural genus. If we wish to understand the nature of a man, we
        shall not waste our time in studying the essential properties of
        a tree or of a stone; for them we should never get beyond these
        substances, which, however interesting in themselves, are quite
        foreign to our subject. Alchemy sets itself to transmute metals
        into gold; hence we must study the essential properties of gold
        and of the other metals, and we must look for our first
        substance among metals, and not in the animal or vegetable
        world. Know, then, that a knowledge of the essence and nature of
        a thing is obtained from a knowledge of its first principles, or
        proximate causes. We cannot understand the changes of bodies, or
        even of quicksilver itself, if we have no radical knowledge of
        its essential properties. The principles of being and of
        knowing, says Aristotle, are the same --- as things are, so they
        must also be understood and known. If we understand the
        substance of our Stone as it is, there is nothing left to study
        but the method of treatment, and this method will be suggested
        by the knowledge we already possess. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every compound consists of a mixture of four
        elements, two of which are enclosed, viz., fire and air, while
        two enclose them, viz., earth and water, whence we see that in
        every composite there is a superabundance of earth and water.
        Fire and air are the formal and moving principles, the two
        others are the material and passive principles. The virtue of
        fire and air can appear only in the earth and water, as the
        virtue of the form can appear only in the substance. For even as
        the form is included or hidden in the matter, so are fire and
        air included in earth and water. Rhasis calls fire and air the
        occult, water and earth the manifest principles of a compound.
        Since, then, the strong are enclosed by the weak, the compound
        is easily corrupted, and the formal principles by their
        exhalation give to the others form, colour, taste, smell, etc.;
        but so long as the material principles remain, they are not
        wholly deserted by the formal. If, on the other hand, the
        compound is not easily destroyed, it is on account of the
        strength of the enclosing principles. If both are weak, the
        whole compound is very perishable, e.g., camphor. If both are
        equally strong, even smallest part of the compound coheres in a
        permanent union with every other. When the humid and the dry,
        and the hot and the cold, are so evenly balanced that there is
        an equilibrium of the elements, they are perfectly united, and
        the compound is indestructible. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elements of our Art, then, are the humid
        and the dry, i.e., water and earth. In water there is enclosed
        air, and in earth fire. But the radical element from which all
        others are derived, is humidity, or water, that is,
        liquefaction, or, according to others, earth. We may reconcile
        the two views by stating, on the authority of Empedocles, that
        when water is thickened, it becomes earth: earth floats upon the
        waters, and is founded upon the waters, as we learn from
        Morienus and Hermes. When wax is in a liquid state, it is like
        water; when it becomes coagulated, it is dry, like earth; and
        yet its weight is the same in both cases. Alexander sets forth,
        in his <i>Epistle</i>, that all the Philosophers apply the name
        of fire to everything that is hot, of water to all that is
        flexible, and of earth or stone to whatsoever is coagulated. But
        neither water nor any other element by itself is of much use to
        us in this Art. They must all be first separated and severally
        purified, and then recombined in even proportions --- that is to
        say, when the water has been purified, we must add to it the
        purified earth, and then we shall have all the four indissolubly
        united, and the work will be perfect. If they are not so united,
        the fire resolves the water into steam, together with the earth,
        and the whole compound perishes. If, then, you would succeed in
        mixing elements, you must know their nature and properties.
        Convert the elements, says Alexander; make the humid dry, and
        the volatile fixed, and you have what you seek. Know that, then,
        all elements are actually converted into earth, and the other
        elements are, and remain, with it potentially and virtually.
        Hence, Hermes says that earth is the element out of which
        everything is made, and into which everything is converted. In
        the composition of the Stone and of gold we have a perfect
        equation of the elements. This well-tempered substance can
        neither be destroyed by the violence of the fire, nor vitiated
        by the impurity of the earth, nor spoiled by an excess of water
        or air. The Stone and gold are thus generated in the fire, and,
        like everything else, flourish in their native element. They
        are, therefore, indestructible by fire, and are rather perfected
        and improved by it than otherwise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These remarks, in the opinion of the ancient
        Sages, had a direct bearing upon the constitution of the
        heavenly bodies. They, like the Philosopher’s Stone, are
        composed of such an evenly balanced mixture of the elements as
        to be indestructible. The active and passive elements are so
        accurately matched in their composition that the formal cannot
        be separated from the material principles. Hence, Nature has
        placed nearest to them the sphere of fire, which conserves
        rather than destroys them. For elementary fire is related to the
        heavenly bodies as material fire is related to gold and our
        Stone. It is through this wise natural arrangement that the
        heavenly bodies may be said to be practically indestructible and
        eternal. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, then, four elements, by reason of
        the four primary qualities; and they are mutually convertible,
        because every one is potentially in every other, and they are
        constantly generating and destroying each other. In substance,
        there is from the beginning of the world only one element, or
        First Matter, out of the conflicting qualities of which the four
        elements are generated by division. Similarly, there are in the
        first substance of this Stone four elements potentially, which
        by our Art are separated, and then again combined. Moreover, we
        believe our Stone to be incorruptible, not only through the
        equation of its elements, but also through the addition to it to
        the fifth element, just as the great world is composed of four
        corruptible elements, and an incorruptible one, which is the
        quintessence. It is this quintessence which, in the small world
        of our Art, holds the four elements together in indissoluble
        union, which also, according to Alexander, is neither hot nor
        cold, neither moist nor dry. This soul of our Art is the divine
        incorruptible sulphur. Other elements are the body, soul, and
        spirit, the dry and the humid, the fixed and the volatile, the
        white and the red. As of all the elements earth alone is fixed,
        and as the elements at the end of our Magistery must become
        fixed, it is clear that they must all be converted into earth,
        or the fixed state of the philosophers. </p>

        <p><b><i>Chapter IV.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>Of the Ferment, and the Modes, Conditions, Properties, and
            Conversion brought about by it.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the ferment, which is the great secret of
        our Art, and without which it cannot attain its goal, the Sages
        speak only in the very obscurest terms. They seem to use the
        word in two senses, meaning either the elements of the Stone
        itself, or that which perfects and completes the Stone. In the
        first sense our Stone is the leaven of all other metals, and
        changes them into its own nature --- a small piece of leaven
        leavening a whole lump. As leaven, though of the same nature
        with dough, cannot raise it, until, from being dough, it has
        received a new quality which it did not possess before, so our
        Stone cannot change metals, until it is changed itself, and has
        added to it a certain virtue which it did not possess before. It
        cannot change, or colour, unless it have first itself been
        changed and coloured, as we learn from the <i>Turba
          Philosophorum</i>. Ordinary leaven receives its fermenting
        power through the digestive virtue of gentle and hidden heat;
        and so our Stone is rendered capable of fermenting, converting,
        and altering metals by means of a certain digestive heat, which
        bring out its potential and latent properties, seeing that
        without heat, as Theophrastus tells us, neither digestion,
        operation, nor motion are possible. The difference between
        ordinary leaven and our ferment is that common leaven loses
        nothing of its substance in the digestive process, while
        digestion removes from our ferment all that is superfluous,
        impure, and corruptive, as is done by Nature in the preparation
        of gold. It is because our ferment assimilates all metals to
        itself, just as common leaven assimilates to itself the whole
        mass of dough, that it has received this name from the Sages.
        Hence it appears that quicksilver (being of the same substance
        with the metals), when fermented and changed into the same
        substance as the ferment, transmutes into its own nature every
        fusible substance of its own kind, and, as its nature is that of
        gold, it converts all metals into gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true the action of this ferment is not
        quite analogous to that of leaven. For leaven changes the whole
        lump of dough into a kind of leaven; but our Stone, instead of
        converting metals into the Tincture, transmutes them only into
        gold. Our Stone rather changes all metals into a kind of
        intermediate substance, such as is the substance of gold,
        between that which they were before and the alternative ferment.
        The colour, too, of gold is intermediate between the blackness
        of iron, the redness of copper, the livid grey of lead, and the
        whiteness of silver. The degree of digestion which is obtained
        is also intermediate between that of copper and iron on the one
        hand, and that of tin and lead on the other. Its fusibility
        further represents the golden mean, since copper is melted with
        difficulty, iron with more difficulty, while tin and lead are
        melted with the greatest ease, and silver and gold not so
        readily as the latter, but more readily than the former. The
        same intermediate quality of gold is noticeable also in its
        ring, that of lead and tin being dull, and that of silver and
        gold moderately clear. To this middle state all metals are
        reduced by our Stone. For, though the virtue of our Stone is
        great, yet, on being mixed with common metals, its action is
        slightly affected by their impurity, and does not change them
        quite into its own likeness, but only into gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More difficult is the second sense of the
        ferment, which is the truly philosophical ferment, and wherein
        is the whole difficulty of our Art, for in this sense it
        signifies that which perfects our Stone. The word ferment is
        derived from a root which denotes seething or bubbling, because
        it makes the dough rise and swell, and has a hidden dominant
        quality which prevails to change the dough into its own nature,
        rectifying and reducing it to a better and nobler state. It is
        composed of divers hidden virtues inherent in one substance. In
        the same way that ferment which is mixed with our quicksilver
        makes it rise and swell, and prevails to assimilate it to its
        own nature, thus exalting it into a nobler condition. In itself
        quicksilver has no active virtue, but if it be mortified
        together with this ferment it remains joined to it forever, and
        is thenceforward changed into the nature of the Sun, the whole
        being developed into ferment, which in turn develops all things
        into gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ferment of which we speak is invisible
        to the eye, but capable of being apprehended by the mind. It is
        the body which retains the soul, and the soul can shew its power
        only when it is united to the body. Therefore, when the Artist
        sees the white soul arise, he should join it to its body in the
        very same instant; for no soul can be retained without its body.
        This union takes place through the mediation of the spirit, for
        the soul cannot abide in the body except through the sprit,
        which gives permanence to their union, and this conjunction is
        the end of the work. Now, the body is nothing new or foreign;
        only that which was before hidden becomes manifest, and vice
        versa. The body is stronger than soul and spirit, and if we are
        to retain them, we must do so by means of the body, as the <i>Turba</i>
        and Plato agree. Without this hidden spiritual body the Stone
        can neither ferment nor be perfected. Of course, the body, soul,
        and spirit of pure Stone are only different aspect of the same
        thing, and according to these aspects the Sages cal it now by
        one name, and now by another. The soul, says Plato, must be
        reunited to its own body, or else you will fail, because the
        soul will escape you. And Hermes insists that it must be its own
        original body, and not one of an extraneous or alien nature, as
        attempted by some who are ignorant of this Arcanum. Rhasis says
        that the body is the form, and the spirit the matter; and
        rightly, because as no substance can exist without form, which
        is its real being, so the soul, through the mediation of the
        spirit, cannot be in the Stone except by the body, because its
        being and perfection depend on the body. Hence, the body is
        their bond and form, though they are the same thing. As that
        which imparts its form to the Stone and to gold, is something
        fixed, and a body, while Mercury is that which receives fixation
        and a form, it follows that the body is the form. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body, then, is that which is the form,
        and the ferment, and the perfection, and the Tincture of which
        the Sages are in search. It is also the Sol and gold of the
        philosophers. It is white actually and red potentially; while it
        is white it is still imperfect, but it is perfected when it
        becomes red. The Sun, says Rosinus, is white in appearance, and
        red by development. Anaxagoras teaches that the Sun is an ardent
        red, but the soul to which the Sun is united by the bond of the
        spirit is white, being of the nature of the Moon, and is called
        the quicksilver of the philosophers. Hermes tells us that
        without the Red Stone there can be no true Tincture. The red
        slave, says Rhasis, has wedded a white spouse. We now see the
        truth of the saying that there are two kinds of gold, one white
        and one red; but the one must be in the other. This white gold
        is, according to Rhasis, a neutral body, which is neither in
        sickness nor in health, and it is, of course, quicksilver. Geber
        says that no metal is submerged in it except gold, which is the
        medium of conjunction between the tinctures. That it is the true
        ferment, Hermes tells us in his seventh book, when he says:
        Note, that the ferment whitens the compound, prevents
        combustion, holds the tincture together, and makes them enter
        each other and remain in union, etc. So also Morienus affirms
        that the ferment of gold is gold, as the ferment of dough is
        dough. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these considerations we see clearly how
        silver and gold are of the same nature, and that silver precedes
        gold, and is predisposed to gold, wile gold is hidden in silver,
        and is extracted from its womb. Hence, Senior says that the
        rising sun is in the waxing moon. Know, ye students of this Art,
        cries Zeno in the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>, that unless you
        first make it white, you will not be able to make it red,
        because the white potentially contains the red. If there be too
        little gold in the compound, says Dardanus, the Tincture will be
        brilliantly white. Alphidius says: Know that the dealbation must
        come first, for it is the beginning of the whole work, and then
        the rubefaction must follow, which is the perfection of the
        whole work. Since the entire substance, viz., the soul united to
        the body b the spirit, is of the pure nature of gold, it is
        clear that whatever it converts, it must convert into gold. At
        first, indeed, the whole mass is white, because quicksilver
        predominates; but because gold is dominant, though hidden, in
        it, when it is ferment, the mass in the second stage of our
        Magistery becomes red in the fullness of the potential sense,
        while in the third stage, or the second and last decoction, the
        ferment is actively dominated, and the red colour becomes
        manifest, and possesses the whole substance. Again, we say that
        this ferment is that strong substance which turns everything
        into its own nature. Our ferment is of the same substance of
        gold; gold is of quicksilver, and our design is to produce gold.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ancients gave the name of body to
        whatsoever is fixed and resists the action of heat; moreover, it
        has the power of retaining in a compound that which is
        essentially incorporeal and volatile, and attempts to volatilize
        the body, viz., the soul. Spirit they called that which
        constitutes the bond between body and soul, and, by abiding with
        the body, compels the soul t return to it. And yet, body, soul,
        and spirit are not three things, but different aspects of the
        same thing. As bond between body and soul, the spirit is said to
        prevail during the Magistery from beginning to end; so long as
        the substance is volatile and flees from the fire, it is called
        soul; when it becomes able to resist the action of the fire, it
        is called body. The force of the body should prevail over the
        force of the soul, and instead of the body being carried upward
        with the soul, the soul remains with the body, the work is
        crowned with success, and the spirit will bind with the two in
        indissoluble union forever. Since, then, the body perfects and
        retains the soul, and imparts real being to it and the whole
        work, while the soul manifests its power in this body, and all
        this is accomplished through the mediation of the spirit, it has
        been well said that the body and the form are one and the same
        thing, the other two being called the substance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how are we to understand Plato’s remark
        that he who has once performed this work need not repeat it, as
        his fortune is made forever? The words do not means that he who
        has once prepared the Tincture can multiply its quantity
        indefinitely, just as he who has once struck a fire out of a
        stone can always keep himself provided with fire simply by
        adding fuel to it. The authority of Plato is supported by that
        of Rhasis, who speaks in a similar fashion. They should be
        interpreted, however, not according to the letter, but according
        to the spirit. He who has once succeeded in preparing this
        Medicine need not any more go through the experience of his
        failures and mistakes: he now knows how to perform all the
        processes of our Magistery properly, and, therefore, if ever he
        should need a fresh supply of the Medicine, he will be able to
        provide himself with it without much trouble. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Alchemist, in the course of course
        of his decoction and putrefaction, has reached the end of the
        first part of our Magistery, in which is seen the simple white
        colour, before the appearance of any other colours, then he must
        straightway set about the second part of the work, and this
        second part is the ferment and the fermentation of the
        substance. Then, if all elements are evenly combined without
        being touched by hand, the artist is a rich man, and has no
        need, thenceforth, in repeating the work, to repeat all his
        former mistakes. But, if he does not combine the elements
        evenly, the whole substance will vanish into thin air, and the
        Alchemist will have lost his hoped-for riches. If, says Haly,
        you do not find this Stone, when it germinates, no other will
        arise in its place. Beware, says Plato, lest in the fermentation
        you come to a bitter end. If there be any hindrance or obstacle
        in the solution, there will most likely be corruption in the
        augmenting. The right moment must be seized here, as in all
        other things. When you are baking bread or sweetmeats, or any
        other solid substance, the moment will arise when they are
        perfectly done; and if after that moment you leave them in the
        oven ever so short a time, they will be marred, burnt, and
        destroyed. Haly compares the preparation of our Stone to that of
        soap, which is spoiled if boiled beyond a certain point. Hence
        the artist must be extremely watchful, and as soon as the
        substance has reached its most subtle stage, he must put an end
        to the digestive process; if he pushes it any further, the
        combined forces of the fire and the volatile part of the
        substance overcome its fixed part, and the whole evaporated. He
        who knows how to pacify and assuage the hostility of the
        elements will be successful in our Magistery, but no other. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of what has been said is to shew
        that at the close of the perfect decoction and putrefaction,
        Nature, by the ministration of our Art, generates a bare simple
        matter, not united to its form; this matter the Ancients called
        first matter, on account of its resemblance to the first matter
        of the world, before it received its form. This matter needs to
        be united to its form, which form is the ferment, and is hidden
        in its womb. This conjunction must take place immediately the
        matter is born; the same will then become durable and
        imperishable. Nature, unassisted, cannot effect this union,
        because it is irrational, and its operations go on forever in
        successive renovation and destruction; but the Artist can watch
        the proper moment, and preserve that which the fire has
        generated. Now, when the conjunction has taken place, the
        substance has nothing more to fear from the fire. If one only
        knows the right moment, the conjunction is a very easy process;
        and when it takes place, there are many wonderful phenomena, as
        Morienus testifies. It is brought about by a well-tempered fire,
        the action of which is stopped by a watchful artist. And this
        conjunction accomplished, it is open to the artist to rest.
        Socrates, in the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>, says that what
        follows is woman’s work and child’s play. Rhasis says that
        nothing but vigilance is requisite, for as the ablution and
        depuration of the elements are accomplished by the presence of
        fire, so are the conjunction, perpetuation, and fermentation of
        the purified matters performed in the absence of fire. </p>
      <p><i>Concerning the Time of Fermentation</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should further be noticed that the time
        for fermenting the substance is the moment when the Stone
        germinates, germination being the revival of a seed after
        apparent death. The quicksilver first melts through the
        digestive action of the fire, and then is coagulated with its
        ferment or body: this process is that which we call germination.
        What a man sows, says Rhasis, that shall he also reap. Seeds can
        only spring up after their kind, and bear fruit after their
        kind. So minerals do not become something else, but return to
        that from which they arose. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, how can Nature generate a simple
        substance not united to its form? This is, nevertheless, a fact
        according to the Ancients, but in a metaphorical sense.
        Aristotle says that as the reason comes to a man from without,
        so the vegetative and sensitive soul comes from within. There is
        in seed the soul and the body, but there is added to it from
        without the rational spirit. In the same way we are to
        understand the metaphorical dicta in our Art. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the action of heat in itself is not
        determined in any particular direction, or towards any
        particular end; but for the attainment of any such purpose it
        has to be used and regulated by an intelligent mind. When I say
        heat, I mean the elementary fire which is generated in all
        things, both animals, and vegetables, and metals. This natural
        fire, without which there is neither growth nor generation, is
        the instrument of the mind, and is regulated by the Artist, in
        respect of quantity, quality, and time, for the attainment of a
        certain well-defined end. If the heat be continued beyond a
        certain point, the form which it had generated is again
        destroyed. The action of fire in itself only tends to
        combustion, but man may regulate it so as to effect many other
        objects. Hence, Pythagoras says that man is the measure of all
        things. Nature is blind and its action indefinite; it follows
        all the influences which are brought to bear on it, in this or
        in that direction; but the will of man is free, and can regulate
        and modify the working of Nature so as to bring about its own
        ends. If the will of man follow Nature, Nature will go beyond
        the proper point, and spoil everything. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of Nature in all things is to
        introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to
        it; and this is also the design of our Art. When, therefore, the
        quicksilver of the Sages has been generated by the skill and
        wisdom of the artist, the form must be added to it, and then the
        work stopped at once, since its end is reached, and anything
        more can only spoil it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Mercury were coagulated by some
        foreign (non-metallic) substance, it would not be of the
        slightest use, since in Nature only homogeneous things will
        combine. The coagulation by means of <i>arsenic</i> and common
        sulphur, though they are mineral substances, tends only to
        corruption. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter V.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>What is Theriac, and What is Called the Poison in the
            Philosopher’s Stone?</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ancients have mentioned, as component
        parts of this Stone, theriac and poison. Like the ferment, they
        are either the perfect Stone, or that which perfects it. In the
        first sense it is improperly, in the second more properly,
        so-called. Because theriac has remarkable cleansing properties,
        and poison possess considerable medicinal virtues, they may mean
        the Stone, which cleanses common metals from all impurities, and
        converts them into gold. The four corrupt metals suffer from
        four different kinds of leprosy, and therefore, each needs this
        poison for its cure. Iron is infected with leprosy from
        corruption of the bile, tin from corruption of the phlegm, and
        lead from simple melancholic corruption, which is also called
        elephantiasis. All these corruptions are due to the presence of
        impure sulphur, which is removed by our poison, or washed away
        by means of our theriac. Silver suffers from a phlegmatic
        leprosy, because it contains a proportion of combustible
        sulphur. But wise Nature in the generation thereof has combined
        a certain theriac therein, and when the sulphur has been purged
        of by the Stone, gold immediately results. Gold alone is free
        from impurity and is perfectly healthy, like pure blood in a
        sound body. In its correct sense, theriac or poison is that
        which is properly called ferment. If the Artist stops at the
        right moment, all will be well; otherwise, the process of
        fermentation will go too far, and everything will be spoiled.
        Hence Hamec says that at this stage the ferment may become
        poison, and the Artist must very carefully beware of its smell,
        for, if he inhale it, it will prove fatal to him. He means to
        say that if it be allowed to evaporate, the Artist will be
        ruined. This Stone, says Morienus, heals the infirmities of
        metals, as theriac cures the diseases of the human body; hence
        it is sometimes called poison, on account of its medicinal use.
      </p>
      <p><i>Note: --- Of the Union of Soul and Body with their Spirit.</i>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the close of our Magistery, when the soul
        seeks its body, we should see that it is able to unite itself to
        it, and receive life and activity. This union and composition
        take place through the operation of the spirit. When the soul is
        united to the body, it lives with its body forever. The
        conjunction occurs at the moment of the soul’s resurrection:
        for, though it existed before, yet it could not manifest itself
        in the body, on account of the defilement and impurity of the
        body. Hence it lays like a thing dead and useless, and, as it
        were, buried with its body. But when it is purified and made
        white by means of our Magistery, it rises clean and white, and
        finds the body from which it had been separated also clean and
        pure, and so it seeks its body, and longs to be united with it,
        in order that it may live for ever: for it cannot be united to a
        strange body. If, therefore, the Artist does not take care, it
        will seek to escape with its body, and carry it upward, when the
        whole work will be annihilated, and the end of the experiment
        made void. Hence the body is called the theriac of its soul when
        the soul is saved by it and is beatified with it; it is called
        poison when it is the cause of the eternal death of the soul,
        through a failure in conjunction by reason of the Artist’s
        folly. But if he seizes the right moment to stop the heat, the
        union is perfected and is rendered indissoluble. In this
        conjunction the body is spiritual, like the soul itself. Thus
        they unite, as water unites with water, and body, soul, and
        spirit are now the same thing, nor can they be separated for
        ever. Because of the insight which their Art gave to them, the
        Ancient Sages knew all about the resurrection of the body and
        the redeeming work of Jesus Christ, as also about the Trinity in
        Unity, and all the other verities of our faith. I am firmly
        persuaded that any unbeliever who got truly to know this Art,
        would straightway confess the truth of our Blessed Religion, and
        believe in the trinity and in our Lord Jesus Christ. Such was
        the experience of Hermes, Plato, and other ancient Sages. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we will now return to the point. We were
        speaking of theriac and poison. When this Stone is born in the
        coction, it is in the likeness of brilliantly white quicksilver,
        and is called the quicksilver of the sages. This quicksilver, to
        be of any utility, must be joined to its body and mortified; it
        is killed by its body, and therefore the body may be called
        poison, in the second and proper sense. And as this death tends
        to healing and glorious restoration, it is, in the same way,
        designated theriac. So it is with men: death is the means of
        giving to them a more glorious life. Our poison, or theriac, is
        thus identical with the above-mentioned ferment, and is the key
        of the whole work, the form of the Sun, and the flower of gold.
        Hence it is advanced by Seno, in the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>,
        that no body is more precious and pure than the Sun, and that no
        tinging poison can be generated without the Sun and its shadow;
        whoever thinks otherwise errs grievously, but he who tinges the
        poison of the Wise by the Sun and its shadow, the same attains
        unto the great Arcanum. Without this theriac and poison our
        Magistery cannot be accomplished; though, of course, they are
        not added from without, but form an integral part of our
        substance. </p>

        <p><b>The Coagulum and the Milk in the Philosopher’s Stone, and
            its Male and Female Agents.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms used in the superscription are
        some of the most secret phrases of our Art, and if we do not
        know their meaning, we know nothing about Alchemy. Some suppose
        that this Stone, when perfect, is related to Mercury, as a
        coagulating substance to milk. For, as a moderate quantity of a
        coagulum clots a large quantity of milk, so a small particle of
        this Stone, when projected upon many parts of Mercury, converts
        them into silver or gold. This view, however, is a great
        mistake. If it were true, of what use would the Stone be for the
        conversion of metals which are already coagulated by Nature? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We say that the coagulation of the Sages is
        that which, in the preceding chapters, has been called the
        ferment, or the body, or the poison, or the flower of gold,
        which is hidden in the Mercury of the Sages when it arises, and
        that Mercury is called the Milk. The coagulum is that which
        coagulates the mercury, and the two are one and the same in
        substance, i.e, Mercury coagulates itself, and is not coagulated
        by any foreign substance, as you may also see in the case of wax
        when it is coagulated. Moreover, as coagulum is made of milk
        alone, but receives the power of coagulation by means of a
        certain digestion and decoction, so this coagulum which arises
        in the Mercury of the Philosophers by means of certain digestion
        and decoction, receives power to coagulate the mercury in which
        it is; and as the coagulum changes a large quantity of milk into
        its own nature, so it is with the coagulum of Mercury and its
        substance. Mercury, thus coagulated, is no longer volatile, but
        has become the gold of the Sages, and their poison. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that this coagulum is the Key of the
        Sages, because when it coagulates the spirit, it at the same
        time dissolves the body, the coagulation of the spirit and the
        solution of the body being the same thing, whence the
        philosophers have laid down that the spirits cannot be contained
        except with the waters of their bodies. Our gum coagulates our
        milk, says Rhasis, and our milk dissolves our gum, after which
        appears the morning redness. When I saw water coagulate itself,
        says Senior, I was sure that all I had been told was true; this
        coagulated water they call the male, and they espouse it to a
        female, whose son he is, and is also his root and coagulation.
        Female they call the milk which is coagulated, and male that
        which coagulates; for activity belongs to the male, and
        passivity to the female. The first part is the fixed part of
        quicksilver, and the second its liquid and volatile part --- out
        of their mixture arises the Stone. The male and the female,
        being joined together, become one body. Venerate, says
        Alexander, the king and his queen, and do not burn them. The
        male is under the female, and has no wings; the female has
        wings, and desires to fly, but the male holds her back. Hence
        the philosophers say: make the woman rise over the man, and the
        man rise over the woman. So also Rosinus: The woman is fortified
        by the man. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must repeat that the male and the female
        are the same in the same subject, and yet have different and
        even contrary qualities. It is like the male and female
        principles in any vegetable seed, or the active and the passive
        principle in an egg. Thus, when the Stone first comes into
        existence, it has in it a mixture of the male and female
        principles, but at first it is liquid, fluent, volatile, bright,
        and capable of coagulation, i.e., female. The coagulum in its
        womb is solid, permanent, fixed, and produces coagulation in the
        other, i.e., is male. The female that flees is passive, white,
        and easily caught by the male; the male that pursues is red, and
        seizes and holds the female with great strength. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Sages have compared the two
        principles in our substance to an old and a young man, because
        the colour of old age is white, while that of youth is ruddy and
        bright. Hence Rhasis: The stone of our science in the beginning
        is an ancient and in the end a boy, because it is first white
        and afterwards red. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have also given geographical names to
        this substance, calling the humid principle the Egyptian, and
        the dry principle the Persian; Egypt the house of humidity, and
        Persia the house of dryness. The Egyptians, says Melvescindus,
        need the help of the Persians. All putrefaction takes place in
        humid substances, but the end of putrefaction is dryness and
        incineration. The putrefaction begins in Egypt, but its end is
        in Persia. They have also described our substance by saying that
        the white female has the red male in her womb, and is in the
        travail throes. The coagulation will then be the accomplishment
        of the birth; that which was within now coming out, and that
        which is flexible becoming fixed. Such are a few metaphors under
        which our substance has been described. </p>

            Generation and Birth of the Embryo out of the Menstrual
            Blood, and of a Chicken out of an Egg --- Considered as
            Analogous to the Birth of Gold out of Sulphur and
            Quicksilver.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now proceed to illustrate our
        meaning still further by the help of some analogies. The first
        analogy we shall select is the generation of the foetus in the
        mother’s womb. The generation of the foetus is brought about by
        the male sperm, in conjunction with the female menstrual blood.
        The latter is the substance, the former the active principle. As
        soon as the form is generated, the sperm is purged off. In
        generation, the male contributes the form and the active
        principle, the female contributes the substance and the body.
        The sperm is to the menstrual blood what the carpenter is to the
        wood in producing a bench, hence the sperm is not part of the
        thing generated. So gold is caused by sulphur as the efficient
        or active means and by quicksilver as the substantial or passive
        means. And as the sperm informs with a form similar to itself,
        and not foreign, so is it in like manner with sulphur. The
        outward sulphur acts by digestion upon the inward sulphur which
        is latent in the quicksilver, and causes it to inform,
        coagulate, colour, and fix the quicksilver into the form of gold
        or of the Stone of the Philosophers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should also be observed that the sperm
        generates out of the substance first the heart, thus impressing
        upon the heart the generative virtue which belongs to it as part
        of the living body. Hen the sperm is separated from the heart,
        because now the heart is able of itself to form the other
        members by means of the generative power imparted to it by the
        sperm. When the sperm has generated the heart, its work is done,
        and all that remains is performed by the heart. The same
        principle holds good in the germination of plants. When the
        seed, in which all the generative force is at first inherent,
        has sent forth the germ or shoot, the seed itself withers and
        decays, as something which has henceforth become useless, and
        the power of generating the rest of the plant is now inherent in
        the germ or shoot. When the germ has once been formed, it no
        longer needs the seed, but produces leaves, flowers, and seed
        out of itself. Thus the germ is, like the heart, generated and
        then separated from its sperm. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same, we declare that the outward
        sulphur generates out of the quicksilver a certain sulphur which
        is like the heart, and to which henceforth belongs all the
        generative force of the outward sulphur. Thus, the outward
        sulphur, being no longer needed, is purged off. The sperm, which
        in our case is the sulphur, having introduced the form into the
        quicksilver, by means of the internal sulphur, by means of the
        internal sulphur, having done its work, is no longer wanted. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should know that since it is unnecessary
        for the moving principle continually to keep in contact with
        that which it moves, provided it has once touched it, as you may
        see from the case of the archer and the arrow, so the sperm, and
        the heart generated by the sperm, need not always keep up their
        connection. In the same way, as soon as the outward sulphur has
        touched the quicksilver, and generated or created another
        sulphur out of the quicksilver, which now possessed the power of
        generating and imparting the form of gold, it is not necessary
        that the outward sulphur should remain any longer in contact
        with the quicksilver; it is sufficient that it has touched it in
        the past. Hence it is fitting that what is extrinsic should be
        separated, as something corruptible from what is incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, in human generation, if the sperm be
        sufficiently powerful, and has sufficient heat to assimilate the
        whole of the menstrual blood to itself, the sperm, coming as it
        does from a male, will naturally produce a male in the mother’s
        womb. But if the sperm has not sufficient heat or strength, it
        will not be able to digest the female substance; the latter
        will, therefore, prevail, and a female will be the result. The
        consequence of this arrangement is that females have not so much
        natural heat as males. It is the same with our sulphur and
        quicksilver. If the inward sulphur has sufficient heat to digest
        the whole of the quicksilver, it assimilates the quicksilver to
        itself, and the whole is changed into gold. In the contrary
        case, the quicksilver will prevail and change the whole
        substance into silver. Hence gold is yellow like sulphur, and
        silver is white like mercury. But the yellowness and whiteness
        in quicksilver are not of double origin; both are of the
        quicksilver, just as the white and yellow of an egg are both the
        product of the female bird. In other metals, the sulphur has not
        yet been able to digest the quicksilver because of its want of
        heat, as in lead and tin, or it has burnt the quicksilver by
        means of its excessive heat, as in iron and copper. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the heat of the sulphur may be in excess
        as well as too little, and thus digestion may be prevented in
        two opposite ways. When heat is too great it dries up the
        humidity of the substance, and when it is too small it is choked
        by this humidity. Too much fire will spoil the food, and too
        little will not be sufficient to cook it. Gold alone, of all the
        metals, is properly digested by temperate heat, and silver in
        the same way; but all other metals suffer either from excess or
        defect of heat. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, after all, we should remember, with
        Aristotle, that the real motive principle in sperm is not the
        sperm itself, but the soul of the person who generates with the
        sperm, as with an instrument to shape the timber or to fashion
        the sword. The intelligent soul of man, through the medium of
        the spirit or blood, moves the hand as an instrument, and the
        hand moves the outward substance. So the soul of the person
        generating uses the seed or sperm as an instrument, and acts on
        the substance or menstrual blood indirectly through the sperm.
        It is the same with sulphur and quicksilver in the generation of
        metals; sulphur is not the principal agent, but the occult
        mineral virtue, or chief intrinsic agent, which acts with the
        heavenly bodies, and makes an instrumental use of the sulphur;
        which, then, in its turn, moves the quicksilver, as a substance
        proper for the generation to which it is moved by the first
        agents. In this Art, the soul or intelligence of the Artist,
        wherein are the species and the knowledge, is the real,
        extrinsic, moving cause, and imparts its purpose to the
        digestive and liquefactive mineral virtue, which again, in its
        turn, moves directly the outward sulphur, and indirectly the
        inward sulphur and the quicksilver. Liquefaction, coagulation
        and other accidents, are brought about the cold and heat, but
        the form is produced by the movement of instrumental forces
        which are themselves set in motion by the intelligent mind of
        the Artist, who modifies, tempers, and aids the action of
        natural conditions. </p>
      <p><i>The Analogy of Common Quicksilver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the egg of the hen without the seed of
        the male bird can never become a chicken, so common quicksilver
        without sulphur can never become gold, or the Stone of the
        Philosophers, because without sulphur it has no generative
        virtue; again, sulphur without quicksilver can never become
        gold, or the Stone, because it is like the seed and sperm of the
        male, and there is no generation without the menstrual blood of
        the female, which is the substance and nutriment of generation.
        The generation of gold is of quicksilver, and its nutriment
        (like that of the chicken in the egg) is of the yellow
        substance, namely, sulphur. Hence the Stone is generated of the
        white, i.e., quicksilver, and the nutriment of the yellow, i.e.,
        its’ hidden sulphur digested by the action of the outward
        sulphur through the regulative power of our Art. Nature has
        wisely mingled the sulphur and common quicksilver, the male and
        the female substance, in metals, for the purpose of their
        generation. And as everything attains to growth and development
        by the same principles to which it owes its generation, so gold
        and the Stone must be perfected by the action of homogeneous
        substances, and not by substances foreign to them. So, also, if
        imperfect metals are to be changed into gold by means of the
        Stone, even this agent can make use only of that substance in
        them which is identical with that of gold, while all foreign
        corruptive elements must be purged off; this means that only out
        of quicksilver can gold be generated by the mediation of the
        Stone, for which reason the sulphureous elements which are in
        the common metals are heterogeneous, and must be removed,
        because they will not amalgamate with it. Those, again, who
        attempt to prepare our Stone out of non-metallic substances are
        grievously at fault, and spend their labour in vain. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The artist who would prepare the Stone, must
        take for his substance neither common quicksilver alone, nor
        common sulphur alone, nor yet a mixture of common quicksilver
        and common sulphur, but a substance in which Nature herself, who
        is the handmaid of Art, has combined quicksilver and sulphur.
        The two substances of which we speak are really one substance,
        and are never found apart. They are capable of developing into
        gold, and this development actually takes place under favourable
        circumstances. For we see that geographical situation has an
        influence in either elevating or degrading animal and vegetable
        forms, we may conclude that the same probably folds good in the
        case of metals. Local influences may sometimes be favourable to
        the development of sulphur and quicksilver into gold, or they
        may cause the process of development to stop short at one of the
        imperfect metals. Again, the imperfection of the common metals
        may be owing to a corrupt state of the surrounding earth, or to
        an excess of bad sulphur. </p>

        <p><b><i>Chapter VIII.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>Refutation of Some Objections. It is said that Copper and
            Iron cannot become Gold and Silver. How this is possible.
            The difficulty solved.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many admit that those common metals which
        are still in a crude and half-digested completed so as to become
        gold. But, they say it is different with iron and copper, which,
        through the excessive quality of their digestive heat, have
        already passed the proper point of temperate digestion, and,
        therefore, can never be brought back to the intermediate state
        indicated by gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should, whoever, be observed that there
        are in all varieties of metal, except gold, two kinds of
        sulphur, one external and scorching, the other inward and
        non-combustive, being of the substantial composition of
        quicksilver. The outward is separable from them; the inward
        sulphur is not. The outward sulphur, then, is not, in any real
        sense, united to the quicksilver: hence the quicksilver cannot
        be really scorched by it. If this be so, it follows that when
        the quicksilver is purified by the removal of the outward
        sulphur, it is restored to its original condition, and can be
        transmuted into gold and silver, whether it be found in tin and
        lead, or in iron and copper; and we may justly conclude from
        these considerations that when the Philosopher’s Stone is
        projected upon iron or copper in a liquefied state, it mingles
        in a moment of time with all the particles of quicksilver
        existing in them, and with these only, as they alone are of a
        nature homogeneous with its own, and perfects them into the
        purest gold, while all particles of external sulphur are purged
        off, because they are not of a nature homogeneous with that of
        the Philosopher’s Stone. For quicksilver always most readily
        combines with any substance that is of the same nature with
        itself, and rejects and casts out everything heterogeneous. It
        does not matter what are the other constituent parts of a metal;
        if it be a metal, and contain quicksilver, that quicksilver can
        be changed into gold by means of the Philosophers’ Stone. So we
        see that, in the case of milk, the coagulum clots only those
        parts of the milk which are of a nature homogeneous with its
        own. The scorching to which our objectors refer, has taken place
        only in the sulphur of iron and copper; the quicksilver is not
        at all affected by this adverse influence, as any experimental
        chemist will tell you. If we burn or coagulate quicksilver with
        sulphur, and make from their sublimation what is called uzifur
        (that is, cinnabar from sulphur and mercury), after the
        magistery of sublimation, we may separate the substance of the
        quicksilver from the uzifer, pure and clean, which shews that
        the quicksilver did not undergo combustion, but the sulphur
        only. It is the same in the cases of iron and copper, and in
        this manner the difficulty is settled. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask me to tell you the matter of the
        Stone which so many Sages have sought. Of course, any one who
        does not know this matter himself cannot impart the secret to
        others. But I have good reason to think that I know something
        about it; and I may speak to you out of the fullness of an
        experience gained through many bitter disappointments and
        failures. Nor do I think it sufficient to make a statement; I
        also desire to furnish you with the grounds of my belief. I will
        now reveal to you all that I have said at great length in the <i>New




          Pearl of Great Price</i> and in my <i>Tract against those who
          at Work upon a Wrong Matter</i>, addressed to Brother Anselm
        the Monk, in a private and confidential manner; and may God help
        me to speak clearly and in accordance with the truth of our Art!
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not enquire after our method of
        procedure, which is the Arcanum and glory of the whole world, as
        the philosophers testify, but you desire to have the matter of
        our Art made known to you; and this knowledge is in itself an
        inestimable boon to a beginner. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know, then, that our <i>arsenic</i> or <i>auripigment</i>
        is composed by Nature of sulphur and quicksilver, as it is found
        in its original natural state. When arsenic is sublimed, it
        often happens that there comes out of it quicksilver in small
        globules like grains of millet, as every experimental chemist
        will tell you. This quicksilver is identical with ordinary
        quicksilver, which may be seen from the fact that it alone of
        all metallic substances will mingle with quicksilver, while the
        quicksilver retains all its own peculiar properties and
        qualities. Hence we conclude that in the composition of <i>arsenic</i>
        there is quicksilver. In the same way, we call sulphur the
        tincture of redness properly and by virtue of its own nature;
        quicksilver is the white tincture, as all Sages tell us. But if
        we project <i>arsenic</i> or <i>realgar</i> upon liquid
        copper, it will tinge that metal with a white colour like the
        whiteness of the Moon; this colour shews the presence of
        quicksilver. In all properly purified metals we find the nature
        of quicksilver rather than of sulphur; for sulphur exists in
        quicksilver in an occult manner. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common sulphur is specifically different
        from <i>arsenic</i>, but belongs to the same genus. Similarly,
        all sulphur, and everything that belongs to the same species
        with sulphur, has the property of coagulating quicksilver; and
        sometimes succeeds in imparting to it a red colour, and
        sometimes fails to do so. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We said above that when <i>arsenic</i> is
        sublimed it gives out globules of quicksilver like grains of
        millet, which is identical with ordinary quicksilver. For this
        reason the Sages have endeavored, by a congruous digestion, to
        coagulate the same quicksilver with itself, even as gold is
        coagulated by its intrinsic power. <i>Arsenic</i>, says Geber,
        has the two metallic first principles, sulphur and quicksilver,
        combined, and by their means may itself be designated as the
        first principle of Nature, in virtue of their properties and
        qualities. In the same book he says that the fetid spirit and
        living water, which is also called dry water, are the first
        principles of Nature. There can be no transition from the
        softness of quicksilver to the hardness of metals, except in
        some intermediate substance. Hence neither quicksilver by
        itself, nor sulphur by itself, is the first principle of Nature,
        but some intermediate matter which contains both. The
        quicksilver extracted from sulphur and <i>arsenic</i> is,
        however, more proximately the substance of our Medicine than the
        same sulphur and <i>arsenic</i> when they remain as they are. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>arsenic</i> to which Geber refers as
        the third principle of Nature in the generation of metals is a
        compound of quicksilver and sulphur, and possesses the virtue
        and power of both. It cannot be properly called sulphur, nor yet
        quicksilver, and thus it is true that there are only two
        principles of Nature. Nor is this <i>arsenic</i>, which has
        quicksilver for its matter and sulphur for its active potency,
        in any sense a thing superfluous, but is a sufficing principle
        of nature in the generation of metals. Hence the quicksilver of
        which we speak is not common quicksilver, nor is our sulphur
        common sulphur; but there is in our quicksilver an occult
        homogeneous sulphur, and it is by means of this inward sulphur
        that all our changes are accomplished. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, do not suppose that any compound
        but the one I have mentioned is the right substance of our Art,
        and forebear to spend your labour in vain upon magnesia,
        marchasite, tutia, antimony, or any other heterogeneous
        material. Our sulphur is the vital agent which digests and
        perfects our quicksilver; but the sulphur of marchasite, for
        instance (as Geber tells us), is only degrading and combustive;
        in the separation thereof the quicksilver of marchasite is left
        dead at the bottom of the vessel, and must afterwards be
        sublimed by fire. Again, we do not find in the composition of
        gold, or of any other metals, anything that suggests or
        resembles marchasite. Though arsenic and marchasite are
        generated from nearly the same elements, their diversity of form
        has combined and developed those elements in a widely different
        manner, since the same substance, if differently digested,
        receives a different form. This is sufficiently patent from the
        fact that different limbs are generated from the same substance.
        As with marchasite, so it is with tutia, magnesia, and all other
        like substances. Thus, through many mistakes, and by a process
        of elimination, we at length, through the grace of God, arrive
        at the substance which we firmly believe to be the right one.
        This short exposition must suffice for the present. </p>

        <p><b><i>From the Works of Arnold de Villa Nova, in Which the
              Composition of Our Stone is Practically and Lucidly Set
              Forth.</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have learned all that Bonus could tell us
        about the first principles of metals and their generation. We
        will now proceed to consider, practically and theoretically, the
        composition of our Stone, since practice and theory are mutually
        helpful: practice is informed by theory, and theory is corrected
        and checked by practice. Now, as Arnold de Villa Nova has, in
        his Rosary, given us a practical treatise on the Philosophers’
        Stone, I will arrange some of his remarks in chapters according
        to the following plan: </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the First</i> shews that there is
        one Philosophers’ Stone, because there is one essence, and one
        method, both in the red and white Medicine. The red Medicine is
        merely a further development of the white. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Second</i> shews whence is
        the Stone extracted. Observe well the answer. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Third </i>shews the chief
        difficulty of our work to be the discovery of the first matter
        of metals. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Fourth</i> shews our first
        physical object must be to dissolve the Stone into its Mercury,
        or primal matter of all metals. Hence the philosopher says that
        we must first be at pains to dissolve and sublime the two
        luminaries, because the primal grade of operation in our Art is
        to reduce them to quicksilver. Unless the bodies lose their
        corporeal nature, and become spiritual, we shall make no
        progress with our work. The solution of a body takes place
        through the operation of the spirit, and is attended with the
        coagulation of the spirit. Then the body mingles with the
        spirit, and the spirit with the body. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Fifth</i> shews the four
        principal methods in this Magistery: Dissolution, Purification,
        Reduction, Fixation. To dissolve is to make the gross subtle; to
        purify is to make the dark bright; reduction is of the humid
        into the dry; fixation is by resolution and coagulation of the
        spirit into its own body, or solid substance. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Sixth</i> shews the
        dissolution of the Stone, and its inhumation, which are the
        first regimen. Dissolution is brought about by purified Mercury.
        This is done in order that we may have sulphur and Mercury of
        that matter whereof gold and silver are developed beneath the
        earth. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter the Seventh </i>shews the second
        regime: Ablution and purification of the black, corrupt, fetid
        matter, so that it may become exceedingly bright, clear, and
        spotless --- which ablution is performed by division of the
        Stone into its four elements and the cleansing of each element.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnold tells us truly that all metals are
        generated from quicksilver and sulphur, which coagulate the
        quicksilver by means of its heat or vapour; since every dry
        element naturally drinks up its humid element. Quicksilver in
        its essence is a compound of very subtle, white, sulphureous
        earth, with bright water, so as to make up one substance, which
        finds no rest upon a plane surface. It is homogeneous in nature,
        and is either wholly fixed, or else wholly evaporates in the
        fire. By constant sublimation it is purified, digested, and
        thickened, and so gradually coagulation is performed by Nature
        in not less than a thousand years; but Art, through the
        mediation of nature, accomplishes it in a very short time. If,
        then, we would prepare the medicine, we must both accelerate and
        imitate Nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quicksilver is the matter and element of all
        metals alike; all of them when melted are converted thereto, and
        it also combines with them; at the same time, in some it is more
        and in some less pure, on account of its corruptive external
        sulphur. But quicksilver is coagulated by virtue of its own
        inward, non-combustive sulphur. The philosopher tells us that
        white, incombustible sulphur congeals mercury, and is the best
        thing that can possibly be used for conversion of mercury into
        good silver. If the sulphur be pure, good, but on the other
        hand, of a red brilliancy, containing the gentle heat without
        the combustive violence of natural sulphur, it is the best thing
        that can possibly be used for converting Mercury into the Sun.
        The result of good quicksilver and impure combustive sulphur is
        copper. Porous, impure quicksilver and impure sulphur produce
        iron. Ti has good, pure quicksilver, but its sulphur is bad and
        ill mixed. Lead has gross, bad, ponderous and earthy
        quicksilver, and bad, fetid, and feeble sulphur. So, at least,
        Aristotle tells us. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common outward sulphur, then, is the
        cause of the imperfection of metals. There are two kinds of
        sulphur in every metal except gold., the outward combustive and
        the inward non-combustive, which belongs to the substantial
        composition of the quicksilver. The outward sulphur is
        separable, and is removed by calcinations; the internal sulphur
        is inseparable from the quicksilver by calcinations in fire. The
        latter the quicksilver retains, nor can it ever be taken away,
        as being homogeneous with it: the former it spurns and rejects,
        and exposes to the action of the fire, which consumes it. It is
        the property of this external sulphur, always either to be
        burned in the fire, or in its composition with quicksilver to
        burn, corrupt, and denigrate. It is quicksilver, then, which
        perfects bodies, and saves them from combustion, because the
        more bodies are of the nature of quicksilver, the less are they
        liable to combustion. And as quicksilver prevents combustion, so
        it is the cause of metallic fusibility, and it is that by means
        of which the tincture pervades the metals, since it receives the
        homogeneous tinctural influence in all its smallest parts.
        Quicksilver adheres more readily to quicksilver, then to gold,
        then to silver, because these two metals are most homogeneous to
        it. It is not so with the other metals, till they are purged of
        their corruptive sulphur. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are, then, the most perfect bodies
        which contain the largest proportion of quicksilver, while those
        which contain less are less perfect. It contains in itself its
        own good sulphur, by means of which it is coagulated into gold
        and silver, but by different methods of digestion. If the
        sulphur be white, it will digest the quicksilver into silver;
        if, on the other hand, it shew a red brilliancy, and have a
        noble but not destructive fire, it will coagulate the
        quicksilver into gold, and the elixir of gold is composed from
        it. Observe that both white and red sulphur are in reality the
        same metallic matter; but they are more and les powerful because
        of the different degrees of their digestion. Hence the
        philosopher says that all gold has red sulphur, and all silver
        white sulphur. But this sulphur is not found upon the earth, as
        Avicenna assures us, otherwise than in these two; hence we most
        subtly prepare these bodies, that we may have red sulphur and
        quicksilver of the same matter on the earth of which gold and
        silver are made under the earth: for these are lucent bodies,
        whose rays tinge other bodies with true white and red. Thus the
        red tincture is obtained from gold, and the white tincture from
        silver. </p>

        <p><b>Shewing that there is but One Philosophers’ Stone.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnold de Villa Nova says that there is but
        one Philosophers’ Stone, and there is but one Medicine, to which
        nothing foreign is added, and from which nothing is removed,
        except that which is foreign to it. Its external sulphur of
        vulgar quicksilver is foreign to it; its inward sulphur belongs
        to its own nature, and into this it must be converted by our
        Magistery. Do not introduce into it, then, any powder, or water,
        or any other foreign substance, because no heterogeneous
        material can possibly enter into its composition. If any foreign
        matter be added to it, it is straightway corrupted, and does not
        become what you desire. The Stone itself, in order that it may
        enter the common metals, must attain a&nbsp; state of great
        fixation and subtleness, that it may become a medicine for
        corrupt bodies. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter II.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>Whence the Physical Stone is Extracted.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our physical Stone, or Medicine, may be
        obtained from all metals; but it is found in the highest
        perfection in gold and silver. Without the Sun and its shadow,
        the Moon, we can have no tinging quicksilver, and he is foolish
        who attempts to accomplish our Magistery in their absence. On
        the other hand, he who knows how to tinge quicksilver with the
        Sun and Moon is in possession of our Arcanum, which may become
        red sulphur, but at first is called white sulphur. Gold is the
        father, and silver the mother of the proximate substance of our
        Stone, for out of these bodies, prepared with their sulphur or
        arsenic, is our medicine elicited. It may, indeed, be possible
        to derive it from other bodies, but it is found nearer to the
        hand, and more easily, in quicksilver, which is the father of
        those lights and the root of all metals. Of this were they all
        made, and into the same all of them return. That which is now
        our Stone is not quicksilver, but once formed part of it, and it
        is this which imparts to it its brightness, preserves it from
        combustion, and is the cause of its perfection. Do not work with
        anything except Mercury and the Sun for the Sun, and Mercury and
        the Moon for the Moon. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As water cannot rise above the level of its
        spring, so the wonderful Tincture, which is to transmute all
        common metals into gold and silver, cannot possibly be perfected
        out of the substance of metals only, not even of gold and
        silver. The elixir must be far more purified and digested than
        these. If gold and silver gave of their perfection to other
        metals, they themselves would become imperfect. The tincture
        which is to impart perfection to all other metallic bodies must
        itself possess a superabundance of digestive perfection and
        matured excellence. Most of our Alchemists leave off with the
        substance with which they ought to have begun, and consequently
        nothing comes of their projection. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter IV.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>On the First Operation of Our Magistery</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first business, according to Arnold,
        must be to dissolve our Stone into its Mercury or first matter.
        Species can be transmuted only by the reduction of their matter
        to the generic First Matter. Hence we must reduce out Stone to
        quicksilver. By the projection of our Tincture, the species, or
        properties of the species, are not changed, but only individual
        quantities of metal belonging to the species. Silver as a
        metallic species is never changed into gold, which has
        immediately its own species, but individuals of this or another
        metallic species may well so change. Your first step, then, must
        be to bring about the dissolution of gold and silver into
        quicksilver. Hence the Sages say: Unless the bodies become
        corporeal, and the spirits corporeal, no progress will be made.
        The true beginning, then, of our work is the solution of our
        body, because bodies, when dissolved, become spiritual in their
        nature, and are yet at the same time more fixed than the spirit,
        thought they are dissolved with it. For the solution of the body
        means the coagulation of the spirit, and vice versa; each gives
        up something of its own nature: they meet each other half-way,
        and thus become one inseparable substance, like water mixed with
        water. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter V.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>On the Perfect Investigation of the Physical Stone.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear, then, that the operation of our
        Stone is the operation of Nature. As ice is water because it is
        dissolved into water, so our Stone, which is dissolved into
        quicksilver, is thereby proved to be quicksilver. Our operation
        is a conversion of the elements, an amicable conjunction of the
        humid with the dry, and of the cold with the hot. But the dry
        becomes humid, and the cold becomes hot, only by means of an
        intermediate substance. If, then, the dry be converted into the
        cold, and the cold into the humid, and the humid into the hot,
        and the hot into the dry, then you have the whole Magistery. The
        four stages of our work, then, are solution, purification,
        reduction, and fixation, the significance of which terms has
        already been explained. Solution is of the gross into the
        subtle; purification is of the dark into the bright; reduction
        is of the humid into the dry; fixation is of the volatile over
        its own body. Let the Stone, therefore, be dissolved with best
        Mercury, purged from its terrestrial and humid nature, by means
        of sublimation, and afterwards reduced. With this let it be
        twice pounded, and then placed in the Balneum Mariae. </p>
      <p><i>How Mercury is Cleansed</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublime your mercury once or twice with
        vitriol and salt, till its substance is very white and
        brilliant, When it is in a volatile state, plunge it into
        boiling water, till it once more becomes quicksilver; remove the
        water, and proceed to use it for our Magistery. Pound it, soak
        it in its own water, and digest it in S. Mary’s bath; distil
        through a filter. Watch for a black oil appearing on the
        surface, which is the true sign of dissolution being completed.
        Watch it well, I repeat, lest it evaporate into smoke, and what
        you do with the white, do also with the red. The difference
        between the Solar and Lunar Medicine is this, that the Solar
        includes the Lunar, but the Lunar does not include the Solar,
        the Solar having in addition a reddish or golden colouring
        substance. Be patient and do not attempt to extract the Tincture
        in a hurry; haste burns up, instead of maturing and digesting,
        our substance. Bear in mind that the chief error in this Art is
        haste, which ends in the combustion of everything. Much fire in
        the beginning is to the detriment of the tincture, and consumes
        the medicine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pound and cook with patience, and reiterate
        the process again and again, because that which is soaked with
        water is softened. The more you pound the substance, the softer
        it will become, and the softer it becomes, the more the gross
        parts are subtilized, till perfect union of body and spirit
        intervenes. For by means of pounding and softening and
        digestion, the parts held together by the viscosity of the water
        in bodies are separated. Bodies that are dissolved, are reduced
        to the nature of spirits, and their union is thenceforward
        indissoluble, like that of water mixed with water: for Nature
        rejoices when the bridegroom is united to the bride. Things
        which cannot be dissolved are devoid of subtle or soft parts. I
        pray you, therefore, labour in the dissolution of the Stone,
        disintegrating the grosser parts that the gross may be rejected
        and the work performed with the subtle. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter VI.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>On the Inhumation of the Stone.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Stone is dissolved, expose the
        whole of it to gentle heat, for its better putrefaction and
        digestion, and for the consummation of the connubial rite,
        during the space of a month of the Sages, i.e., of thirty days,
        since the danger of combustion is removed by digestion and
        inhumation. Let all be boiled together over a gentle fire, till
        the whole substance resolves into its first matter, and becomes
        truly like quicksilver. The sign that the solution is complete,
        is a blackness, which appears after a certain time, which also
        we denominate the Raven’s Head. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Stone is fully dissolved in S.
        Mary’s Bath, it should be passed through a filter. The blackness
        is a sign that the process of volatilization is accomplished. </p>
      <p><i>Recapitulation of the First Regimen.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublime he Mercury, dissolve it; then
        subject the whole substance to coction, till it is reduced to
        its first nature, i.e., till we have sulphur and quicksilver, of
        the same matter which in mines is digested into gold and silver.
        And he that has this Magistery has an everlasting treasure. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Chapter VII.</i></b> </p>
        <p><b>The Second Regimen, or That of Purification.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second regimen of the Stone is its
        ablution, that is to say, the removal of al that is black,
        corrupt, and fetid in it, whereby it is rendered very brilliant,
        and clear, and pure. This is brought about by the division of
        the elements, the distillation of the elements, the distillation
        of the waters, and the solution of the Stone, because there are
        two dry or stony, and two humid or watery elements. The dry
        elements are fire and earth, the aqueous are air and water. Fire
        purifies water by distillation, and thus all the elements
        cleanse and become assimilated to each other. So is our Stone
        divided into four elements, that it may be the better
        subtilized, and cleansed from stains, and afterwards more firmly
        conjoined. But nothing ever was born, has grown, or is animated,
        except after putrefaction and digestion. If there be no
        putrefaction, there can be no melting and no solution, but if
        there be no solution, then nothing is accomplished. </p>
      <p><i>Division of the Stone into Four Elements</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the Stone in its putrefied state,
        cleanse it by the cleansing of the four elements, by
        distillation, by a light and equable fire. Take the water. Then
        increase the fire a little, till all the air is mixed with fire,
        and that which remains at the bottom, in a burnt state, is dry,
        black earth. The water is cleansed in the bath of S. Mary, but
        air and fire are distilled through the ashes, and the grosser
        parts of the earth remain below, while the more subtle parts are
        carried upward. Earth dessicates and fixes, water purifies and
        cleanses. Air and fire tinge, and cause fluidity; hence it is
        necessary to have much water and air. The quantity of the
        Tincture will be in proportion to the quantity of air. Seek,
        therefore, my dearest, in all thy works to overcome Mercury in
        commixtion, that thou mayest have enough of air; and if thou art
        able to perfect this by itself, thou will be the explorer of the
        conquering potency which resides in the highest perfection of
        Nature. After this operation it is still necessary for the
        Medicine to be matured and nourished over the fire, as the child
        is nourished at the breast. </p>
      <p><i>On the Ablation of Water.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have separated the elements of the
        Stone, cleanse them; cleanse the air and water by a seven-fold
        distillation. The fire and earth, on the other hand, must be
        well calcined. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distill the air and water separately, for
        the air is more precious than the water. The air tines the
        earth, and infuses into it life and the sensible soul. Air and
        water must be guarded from excessive heat, or they will be dried
        up. This is brought about by inhumation. When the purification
        is complete, the whole substance is wonderfully white and
        brilliant. The sediment of the water in distillation must be
        carefully removed and set apart with the blackness of the earth,
        already mentioned. Set also apart the seven times distilled
        water, for the same is the Medicine and the Water of Life which
        washes the Laton. As you do with the white water, so do also
        with the red; there is no difference between the two, except
        that one tinges white, and the other red. </p>
      <p><i>On the Ablution of Air.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate the air from the fire by
        distillation, viz., through the ashes. That which is distilled
        is most pure air; that which remains at the bottom, is dry fire.
        The air is the oil and tincture, the gold and soul of the Sages,
        the ointment by means of which the whole Magistery is effected.
        Fire and air must be distilled together because they re of the
        same nature. If you mix the Stone with fire, it will be red, and
        have all the virtues of the Red Tincture. </p>
      <p><i>How Oil is Extracted from all Things.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place over the body, whence you wish to
        extract oil, sufficient Mercury to cover it completely, that is,
        to the height of four inches, or better if more; then put it
        over a slow fire. The oil, or air, will soon begin to bubble up
        through the quicksilver. Collect it carefully, and, if
        necessary, that is, should the quicksilver begin to diminish,
        add more pure and warm quicksilver and continue the coction till
        all the oil has been obtained. This oil must then be purified by
        inhumation and sevenfold distillation through the alembic, till
        it be brilliantly white. It will float on the surface of our
        water. Set it apart, for it is the Oily Tincture, the Golden
        Soul, and the Unguent of the Philosophers, which colours,
        tinges, fixes, and makes fluid. A thin plate of metal steeped
        into it, will be changed into silver if it be of the white, and
        into gold if it be of the red grade. But do not mix the oil of
        gold with the oil of silver, or the reverse; for each has its
        own special purpose, one to tinge white, and the other to tinge
        red. </p>
      <p><i>Difference between Water and Oil</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water only cleanses, oil tinges and colours.
        If you dip a rag in clean water, it will become cleaner than it
        was; but the water will evaporate. If you dip it in coloured
        oil, it will be saturated with the colour of the oil, and you
        will be able to remove this colour only by burning the whole
        rag. For oil is thicker and more intense, and yet, at the same
        time, lighter that water. Nevertheless, it is by means of water,
        and from water, that we obtain this oil. The water is the
        spirit, which retains the oil, or soul, as the soul retains the
        body. Through the oil our coagulation is effected, because it
        retains the volatile substance. Sow the soul in white flaky
        earth, for it will retain it: since, when it has ascended from
        earth to heaven, and descended to the earth, it will have
        received the strength of things above, and of things below. </p>
      <p><i>The Cleansing of Fire and Earth.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collect the impure sediments obtained from
        the cleansing of the oil, and place tem with the fire, since
        they are fire, and have blackness and redness which must be
        pounded with the first water, and gently burned till they become
        a dry powder, without any of the humidity of air. So, also, the
        sediment of water must be combined with earth, and thrice
        calcined till it becomes white and dry. Calcine fire with fire,
        and earth with earth, till they are pure and free from
        blackness; what ascends from the fire is the red oil; what
        ascends from the earth is the white precious oil. Perform all
        these processes, and preserve each part carefully by itself. </p>
      <p><i>The Cause of Ablution According to Plato.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Plato, you should to the
        fullest extent of your ability effect the separation of the
        elements: cleanse water and air by distillation, and earth by
        heat and calcinations, till nothing of the soul is left in the
        body, i.e., when nothing more evaporates from it, if placed on a
        red-hot metallic plate. In no part of our operation do we need
        any water but our white water, nor any oil but our white or
        orange-coloured oil, nor any fire except our red fire, nor any
        earth except that which is pallid or slightly white. But if you
        thus prepare the elements, the earth will be ready for solution,
        the water efficacious for digestion, and the oil, in which is
        the fire, eminently fitted for tinging. If the end of your
        process should not present you with such elements, this is an
        indication of error; set about the correction thereof, for it
        will be easier than beginning again. Keep each element carefully
        sealed up in a well-stoppered jar, write upon each its own name,
        and a record of its properties, for it would be fatal to mistake
        one for the other. </p>
      <p><i>On the Third Regimen, Which is that of Reduction.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third regimen consists in bringing back
        the humid water to the dry earth, that it may recover its lost
        humidity. Since fire and earth are both dry elements, they must
        first be combined before this restoration can take place. Then
        the dry elements will be in a condition to drink up more
        moisture than they had before, for calcinations disintegrates a
        body and so empties it of all moisture, that it will imbibe its
        aqueous humidity very greedily. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnold here places a chapter on the
        albification and sublimation of the earth by frequent pounding,
        imbibition, and digestion of the Mercury. When this process sis
        fully accomplished, that is, when it ascends white as snow, we
        have the good, flaky brilliantly white earth, or the white
        incombustible sulphur. If you wish to obtain red sulphur,
        dissolve this white sulphur in red water, by means of pounding,
        and saturation, and good decoction; coagulate it alternately
        into a stone and alternately dissolve what is coagulated in the
        red water. After the third time, sublime the whole in a fierce
        fire, and that which rises upward will be snowy white sulphur,
        while that which remains at the bottom will be red, like
        scarlet. Hence you will see that while there are two different
        stages of our Magistery, there is in reality only one Stone. </p>
      <p><i>The True Method of Bringing Back the Water to the Earth.</i>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour at first upon the earth (which you have
        carefully pounded) one-fiftieth part of its own quantity of
        water; for it is necessary at the beginning to give the earth
        little water, just as an infant has to be given at first little
        nutriment, and then gradually more. This should be repeated over
        and over again, with great patience, more and more water being
        poured over the earth each time, but not more than the earth can
        conveniently drink up; after each trituration and effusion, the
        whole should be subjected to thorough coction for eight days at
        a time. Without constant, patient irrigation the earth cannot
        bring forth fruit. Continue the trituration and assation until
        all the water has been absorbed and dried up, while the earth
        has become white. The water is to be administered temperately
        after each calcinations; too much of it will produce a
        tempestuous condition too little will convert the matter into
        glowing ashes. The degree of heat applied should be that of
        horse dung. After imbibition, it should be inhumed for seven
        days. There are three colours, marking the three stages of this
        process. The black colour shews that the substance is still
        imperfect: after its appearance the heat of the fire should be
        slightly increased. By constantly repeating the process you will
        soon make the earth white; and then you should behold the orange
        colour. The more limpid the water, the more limpid the earth
        will be; the more the earth is washed, the whiter it will
        become. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things are sublimed either by themselves, if
        they are spirits, or, if bodies, they are sublimed by means of
        some spiritual substance. Our earth is not sublimed in its
        condition as calx, unless it be first subtly incorporated with
        mercury. Hence you should pound the earth, saturate it with
        mercury, and digest them till they become one body. This must be
        repeated over and over again, or else the sublimation cannot
        take place, because the earth will not be properly incorporated
        with the mercury. Sublimation is contingent upon the reduction
        of the body into a subtle matter and nature. By means of this
        sublimation bodies are freed from their grosser elements, and
        reduced to their first matter, which can then be perfectly
        developed. If you wish to develop the sublimed substance into
        silver, both earth and mercury should be white: if you wish to
        develop it into gold, they should both be red, and the powder
        should be incerated. When Mercury is sublimed for the Moon,
        nothing else should be mixed with it, for the colour of the Sun
        does not enter into the Moon, nor that of the Moon into the Sun.
        Do not mix that which ascends with that which remains below.
        That which remains below should be again pounded and saturated,
        till the whole is sublimed or incorporated with Mercury. In the
        sublimation of Mercury you will see a most white earth, like
        snow, and, as it were, a dead powder adhering to the sides of
        the aludel. Reiterate sublimation thereon, without the faeces
        remaining below. Soon that which ascends will settle in the
        shape of a white, flaky powder, These are the superior ashes,
        while that which remains below is the foul sediment, and should
        be removed. In this way the white sulphur or white tincture is
        perfected. </p>
      <p><i>The Fourth Regimen, Which Consists in Fixation, and for this
          Purpose We Need a Certain Ferment.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth operation is to fix the white and
        red sulphur over a fixed body, i.e., silver and gold
        respectively. Without a proper ferment the Moon cannot become
        the Sun, but the substance, having nothing to prevent it from
        doing so, will again revert to water. It must therefore be
        incorporated with the body from which it was prepared, viz., the
        Moon or the Sun. It is necessary, in fact, to unite it with is
        own proper body. For this purpose mix it with the ferment
        (either white or red), which will completely assimilate it to is
        own nature. Do not mix the ferment of one (white) sulphur with
        another (red) sulphur: the result would be disappointing. The
        ferment of gold is gold, and the ferment of silver is silver,
        and there are no other proper ferments in all the world, because
        nothing fixes which is not itself fixed. </p>
      <p><i>The Weight of the Ferment must Exceed, or at Least be Equal
          to, the Weight of its Sulphur.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quantity of volatile sulphur in any
        ferment must not be greater than that if its body. If there be a
        preponderance of the body, says Plato, it will quickly change
        the volatile sulphur into a powder of its own colour, i.e.,
        either that of gold or of silver. The sulphur cannot enter the
        bodies except through the medium of water, the intermediate
        substance between the sulphur and the ferment. Therefore put
        first the earth, then the water, and then the air (Avicenna). If
        you wish to obtain the red Tincture, put in the fourth place
        fire, since the white Tincture needs only three elements, but
        the red Tincture needs fire as well. Open, therefore, and seal,
        solve and coagulate, wash and dry, for water is the medium which
        joins the tinctures of oil, air, and fire. If you first take oil
        and then earth, the oil will mortify in the earth, for the water
        will enter. If you first take water and then oil, the oil will
        float upon the water. But if you first take water and afterwards
        earth, the earth will outweigh the earth till it adheres to it.
        If one of the four be destroyed, all will die; if one have more
        soul than another, it will be worthless. The ferment is the
        soul, see that you arrange fermentation so as to produce a
        calcined, dissolved, and indurated dust. If the fermentation be
        not rightly performed, the whole Magistery will fail. </p>
      <p><i>The Practical Uses of Dividing the Elements.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not divide the Stone into its four
        elements, the soul cannot well be united to the body. If you do
        no mix of the body with that over which you desire to make the
        projection, the body will not love the spirit. If you do not
        combine the ferment with the elixir, the body over which the
        projection is made is not properly coloured. If you do no
        sublime all you put into the elixir, it will be rough gold and
        silver, and if the whole be not prepared, it will not sustain
        the fire. Finally, without pains in softening and hardening, the
        gold and silver will want ductility in operating. The earth
        which is put into the elixir must be sublimed, in order that the
        whole may be completely united. If you wish to project the
        elixir, make earth of that substance whose body you wish to
        change, and put it in the ferment (as above), if it be gold, of
        gold, and if be silver, of silver. You must combine the ferment
        with the body on which you desire to project the elixir. The
        body and the ferment which are combined in the elixir must be a
        powder twice or thrice sublimed. Each sublimation will intensify
        the virtue of the elixir, namely, one upon a hundred, a hundred
        upon a thousand, and so on to infinity. </p>
      <p><i>We must be careful about the Proper Quantity of each
          Substance.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to prepare our Stone, you should
        know how much water, and air, and fire, and earth it contains
        when it is calcined, when it is dissolved, and when it is
        reduced respectively. In the first case, there will be greater
        dryness, greater heat, less moisture, less cold. In the second,
        there will be greater cold, less heat, more moisture, and less
        dryness. In the third, there will be greater heat, less
        moisture, more dryness, and less cold. </p>
      <p><i>How the Elements are Improved, and how the Fusion of the
          Medicine is affected.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the conjunction of the Stone, expect
        three principal colours, first the black, then the white, then
        the red. Take care that the tincture does not become red before
        it becomes black, for then it will perish by combustion, and
        that none of the colours appear before their proper time, or out
        of their proper order. Should the red appear before the black,
        or before the white, decoct the whole in white water until the
        proper colour is restored. Note also that decoction by
        inhumation obviates the error of combustion, and restores lost
        humidity. If the medicine does not combine properly, correct by
        dissolution. The purification and dissolution are brought about,
        not by common, but by mercurial water. We calcine the medicine
        that we may the better dissolve it, that it may the better be
        cleansed, fixed, and melted, and may be more fully permeated.
        Towards the end of the Magistery, it is a good plan to dissolve
        the body of the ferment, whether white or red, in order that it
        may amalgamate all the more readily. Not all the parts are
        separated in dissolution, but the separation is sufficiently
        complete to ensure the removal of all impurities. If the metal
        which is to be changed by means of the Medicine, have not
        sufficient colour, more of the Medicine should be added; if it
        have too much, the dose should be smaller. If the Medicine be
        not sufficiently fixed, the remedy lies in repeating the
        dissolution and coagulation several times. If it be too firm,
        more of oil, that is, of the air of the Stone, should be added;
        and observe, as a general rule, that for fixation you must have
        more of the cold and dry, and less of the hot and humid
        elements. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Quantities to be Observed in Fixation.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Nature is ruled by ratio and proportion;
        hence, in the fixation of our Stone, we must know how much we
        need of water, air, earth, and fire. If the right proportions
        are not observed, your whole work will be a failure. Either too
        much or too little of earth, air, fire and water would entail
        some corresponding defect. I speak here of elixirs in general,
        but fire is not introduced as an element of the white elixir.
        The heavy elements in our substance and the ferment are called
        earth: those which rise upward are described as air and water.
        For fixation into earth, in the case of the white Tincture,
        there should always be more of earth than of the other elements.
        If there be 1-1/2 ounces of air, and 2 ounces of water, there
        must be 2-3/4 ounces of earth, and thrice as much of the ferment
        of earth as there is of white sulphur. If there be 1 ounce of
        white sulphur, there must be 3 ounces of the ferment. Add 2
        ounces of water, 1-1/2 of air, and the elixir will be complete.
        For the solar Tincture, which is of hotter quality than that of
        the Moon, we need 2 ounces of earth, 3 of water, as many of air,
        and 1-1/2 of fire --- for if there be much water and little
        fire, the fire will be extinguished. The heavy elements, like
        earth and water, are more useful for the purpose of producing
        fixation and rest; the lighter elements, viz., air and fire, are
        more useful for the purposes of fusion and of the Tincture. Do
        not eat what you do not drink, neither drink what you do not
        eat, but eat and drink one after the other according to the
        requirements of our art. </p>
      <p><i>On the Fixation and Composition of the White Elixir.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No body which has not first been purified
        can possibly retain its soul. Let there be drinking after
        eating, not vice versa. Fix well, mix well, tinge well, and you
        have the whole Magistery. Pound three parts of pure powdered
        silver well with twice its quantity of white quicksilver in a
        mortar of porphyry, till the Mercury has drunk up all the
        silver, and the compound is of the consistency of butter, Purify
        it with vinegar and common salt, till the vinegar comes out pure
        and clear; then wash away the salt with clean, sweet water, and
        dry before the fire. Pound it with one part of the white sulphur
        till the two become one body, incerate it with one part of its
        white water, and sublime little by little over the fire, till
        all that is volatile in its has ascended upward; take it out and
        cool and collect the particles which have settled on the sides
        of the vessel; then repeat the process of pounding, saturation,
        and sublimation --- constantly reducing that which ascends
        upward to that which lies fixed below, till all is fixed, which
        is naturally brought about by the coagulative virtue of the
        fixed sulphur. In short, study Nature, and supply her with all
        necessary outward conditions: then you may trust to her to do
        the rest. When your earth is impregnated you may expect a birth
        in Nature’s own good time; when the birth has taken place,
        nourish and strengthen it to support the fire, and you will be
        able to make projections. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Reduction of Air upon the White Elixir.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the water is fixed with the earth,
        pound it, saturate it by sprinkling with one part of its air,
        sublime it with a gradually increasing fire, till by constant
        sublimation the whole is fixed. Then expose it to a good fire
        for another day and night, and to a very fierce fire, proper for
        melting, on the third day and night. The air will then be fixed
        with the earth and water. </p>
      <p><i>Inceration of the White Elixir.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take one drachm of the crystal plate which
        you find at the bottom of the vessel; pound it, and drop on it
        slowly, in a thin crucible, over a gentle fire, some of its
        white air, till it becomes liquid, like wax, without any smoke.
        Test upon a hot plate, and if it melt swiftly like wax, the
        ceration is complete. If not, complete the process by dropping
        its white oil gradually thereon, till it becomes like smokeless
        melted wax. Continue the sublimation until the whole substance
        is fixed. That is, when by sublimation you have fixed the purest
        part of the earth, reiterate the sublimation upon the unfixed
        part over the fixed part, until all is fixed. Try its fusibility
        over a good fire; if the result be satisfactory, the sublimation
        need not be continued. If not, continue sublimation in respect
        of the unfixed part. Then let it cool, and you have a priceless
        Tincture, one part of which --- with salt dissolved in vinegar
        --- will transmute 1000 parts of Mercury, or common metal, into
        the purest silver, better than that of the mine. </p>
      <p><i>The Composition of the Red Elixir.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Red Elixir --- for changing metals into
        gold --- is prepared in the same way as the White Elixir, gold
        being in this case substituted for silver. For every white
        things substitute a red thing of the same kind; in the place of
        powdered silver put powdered gold, and the water of Mercury made
        red with the fire of the Stone. Sublime the substance again and
        again till all the quicksilver has become fixed. When
        three-quarters of the red water are fixed, place the whole for
        24 hours over a very gentle fire, that it may be the better
        cleansed and fixed. Remove it subsequently, and cerate in a
        crucible, also over a very slow fire. Drop upon it its red oil,
        till it becomes liquid as wax without smoke. One part of this
        Red Tincture projected upon silver, or purified quicksilver ---
        with salt and vinegar --- changes 1000 parts of either into the
        purest gold, better than that of the mine, and withstanding
        every test. Hence the Sages say that their gold and silver are
        not as the gold and silver of the multitude, seeing that they
        are distinguished by infinitely greater purity. </p>
      <p><i>On the Multiplication of the Medicines.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dissolve those medicines, after their
        fixation and saturation, with their white or red oils, till they
        flow like wax, and then in their white or red Mercury, till they
        look like clear water, and afterwards coagulate them by gentle
        digestion, and again make them liquid with their oils over the
        fire till they flow very swiftly, their virtue in projection
        will be doubled. If, when they are dissolved, you distil them
        once, their powers are multiplied an hundredfold. To multiply
        the medicines, dissolve the spirit of each respectively in its
        water by inhumation, separate from each its oil by distillation,
        then their water, then their fire, and the earth will remain
        below. Reduce the water by sublimation over the earth, ill it is
        fixed with the earth; then saturate it with the oil, or air, and
        the tincture till it is fixed and liquid like wax; its virtue
        will then be multiplied tenfold; repeat the operation, and its
        virtue will each time be enhanced 100, 1,000, 10,000 fold, etc.
        The oftener the medicine is dissolved, sublimed, and coagulated,
        the more potent it becomes; in each sublimation its projective
        virtue is multiplied by ten. </p>
      <p><i>What do we mean by Dissolution and Sublimation?</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I speak of solution, you must not think
        that the elixir is to be altogether resolved into water, but is
        only to be subtilized as far as possible to have its parts
        divided, that which is dry in it made humid, and that which is
        gross made simple, since dissolution is practiced for the work
        of subtilization only, but not sublimation, and for the purpose
        of uniting the body and the spirit. The subtilization of bodies
        is the dissolution into water, because distillation or
        dissolution educes the Stone from potentiality into effect, in
        which the body and the spirit meet each other halfway, and are
        thus inseparably conjoined. The confirmation of spirits with
        bodies takes place when bodies are subtilized, for not otherwise
        will these retain the spirits. I have not said too much; but if
        there be anything in my remarks which you do not understand,
        read them over again and again, until you have become completely
        possessed of my meaning. What we have said is the strict rule of
        truth, and you must not depart from it either to the right or to
        the left, or you will go wrong. If you do not understand my
        meaning, do not blame me, but your own ignorance. </p>
      <p><i>How to Make the Projection.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, seeing that it is a matter of some
        difficulty to melt a million parts together, when you wish to
        make projection proceed as follows: Take a hundred parts of
        Mercury, cleansed with vinegar and salt; place it in a crucible
        over the fire; when it begins to bubble up, add one part of your
        Elixir, and project the whole upon one hundred other parts of
        boiling purified Mercury. Then project one part of this entire
        mixture upon one hundred parts of purified Mercury, and the
        whole will be turned into our Elixir. Then project one part of
        this last, coagulated, upon one hundred parts of purified
        Mercury, and it will become the purest gold, or silver,
        according as the Tincture is red or white. And this is the
        Rosary of the Philosophers, bearing fragrant roses, both white
        and red, the essential extract of many books, having nothing
        superfluous, omitting nothing needful, for the infinite
        production of true Sun and moon. Our Medicine has also power to
        heal all infirmity and diseases, both of inflammation and
        debility; it turns an old man into a youth. If the illness be of
        one month’s standing, it may be cured in a day; if of one year’s
        standing, it may be healed in a month. Hence this Medicine is
        not without reason prized above all other treasures that this
        world affords. </p>
      <p><i>Recapitulation of the Whole Work.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First sublime the substance, and purge it of
        all corrupting impurity; dissolve also, therewith, its white or
        red additament till the whole is as subtle and volatile as it
        can possibly become. Then fix it by all the methods until it is
        able to stand the test of the fire. After that, sublime the
        fixed part of the Stone together with its volatile part; make
        the fixed volatile, and the volatile fixed, by alternate
        solution and sublimation; so continue, and then fix the both
        together till they form a white or red liquid Tincture. In this

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could do what my kindly feelings
        towards the students of this work prompt me to do, I would copy
        out all the works of Raymond Lullius. As it is, I must be
        content with giving you an abridgment of his letter to King
        Rupert, which is as lucid and clear as it is short. This
        treatise is an epitomized summary of all his works, as he
        himself calls it, and is therefore both brief and weighty. </p>

        <p><b><i><font size="+1">Letter or Epitome of Raymondus Lullius.</font></i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this art is beset with a possibility
        of error and misunderstanding on every side, I have striven as
        far as possible to express myself so clearly and accurately as
        to preclude all risk of misapprehension. I do not doubt that
        you, King Rupert, have read all my books, and pondered them
        well, but you ask me to provide you with an epitome of
        everything that I have said, in order that you may the more
        readily carry it in your mind, and I gladly comply with your
        request. I received your letter in Vienna. But not till after my
        arrival at Salerno did I find myself able to attend to it. If
        you are not satisfied with my method, you must needs seek one
        that is shorter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ Raymondus is here speaking of the method
        of his master, Arnold. For Raymondus divided the elements, and
        subtilized spirit and body in a different way from that which
        Arnold delivered to him, though, of course, the substance of the
        Stone, and the substantial mode of procedure, were the same with
        both. ] </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask which of the three Stones is more
        useful, readily obtained, and efficacious: Well, the mineral
        method is long and full of risks. It consists in two waters, one
        of which makes the Stone volatile without labour or danger; the
        other fixes it, and is fixed with it, and this operation is
        attended with risk. This latter water is extracted from a
        certain fetid menstruum; it is stronger than any other water,
        and the danger consists in the ease with which, in ablution, its
        spirit may escape. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Animal Stone is far more difficult of
        composition, so that far greater knowledge is required for it;
        yet it enables you not only to transmute metals into gold, but
        to change anything into any other thing, whence the potency of
        this Stone is infinite. The Vegetable Stone takes still longer
        to prepare, and has still more wonderful virtues than the Animal
        Stone. It should follow the Animal Stone as far as the
        rectification of elements, and, if thus prepared, its effect
        passes into the animal. Everything transmuted by means of the
        Vegetable Stone, far transcends Nature in excellence and size,
        because it is impregnated with the quintessence which performs
        so many wonderful things in the world. All alchemical gold is
        composed from corrosives, and from the incorruptible
        quintessence which is fixed with the ferment by the skill of the
        artist. Such quintessence is a certain mortified and empoisoned
        spirit in the Mineral Stone. The Animal Stone may be the most
        miraculous medicine for the human body, just as if it were an
        extract of human blood. The quintessence which is in the
        Vegetable Stone restores youth, and preserves the human body
        from all accidental corruption. The spirit of the quintessence,
        as you know, is that which tinges and transmutes, if it be mixed
        with its proper ferment. The Vegetable Stone is more noble, and
        useful, and efficacious, than all the rest. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask me whether the work can be
        shortened; I tell you that all abbreviation diminishes
        perfection, so that the medicine which is composed by
        accurtation has less transmutatory power. There is, however, a
        multiplex accurtation of the Mineral Stone. In order to curtail
        its effect as little as possible, you should after the first
        calcination and putrefaction, which is performed with the most
        limpid and clear first water during a space of 20 days, and not
        less, separate from the substance a red powder, and distill it
        with the second water so as to prevent the escape of the spirit.
        Take only the last part of this water, after rubefaction in the
        alembic. Dissolve therein the powders, by placing both in hot
        water in a sealed vessel; then set over it an alembic, and
        distill as much as will ascend. This water pour away; that which
        remains with the body coagulate in a well-closed vessel among
        hot ashes; make other water and pour over it, then distill and
        coagulate ten times. Thus the Stone will be made perfect. If you
        wish to increase its efficiency, you may go on distilling and
        coagulating it as often as you like, or until it is impossible
        to congeal the body further. This Medicine will change metals
        into gold, and may be completed in 80 days at the most. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Animal Stone, there is no
        possibility of abridgment, except, indeed, that the earth may be
        ruled with fire, and the water with air, when its efficacy will
        be the same; this is called the accurtation of middle time. As
        to the Vegetable Stone, the same may be said. The following
        directions will be found useful in the preparation of this
        Stone. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the black powder which is blacker than
        black, and distill of it 18 parts in a silver vessel, and in the
        way suggested in my Testament. At the first distillation take
        only 1-1/2 part, distil again, and then its 4th part, which also
        distill a third time; of this again take 2 parts for the fourth
        distillation, in which take a little less than the whole;
        distill this 8 or 9 times. Then take a pair of equal sized
        vessels with narrow mouths, to each of which an alembic is
        attached. Let a cucurbite also be fitted to one of the alembics.
        Put in each mouth one pound of this water and one ounce of
        ferment; place the vessels on a gentle fire, or a furnace the
        heat of which can be properly regulated. The ferment will be
        dissolved. Wet sponges with cold water, and tie them over the
        tubes of the alembic. The ferment, when quite dissolved, will
        ascend with its water, and the contents of the two vessels
        communicating will be distilled form one into the other, twice
        every day, and twice every night, one pound remaining all the
        time in each vessel. For as much ascends from one vessel enters
        it from the other. By this continual heat the body is
        subtilized, and the spirit condensed. The gentler the fire, and
        the slower the distillation, the more perfectly is the process
        performed. Continue this operation for 20 or 22 days, and the
        quintessence of this Blessed Water will then be so thickened as
        not to ascend any more, for then it is fixed with the ferment
        and changed into the Stone. Take out of the distilling-vessels
        and place in horse-dung, or the bath. Then dissolve and repeat
        this thrice or oftener. The Stone will then be most precious in
        divine virtue and exalted power. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take the White Ferment, the
        quintessence will be coagulated in 10 days; but it is no so
        easily dissolved as the Solar Ferment. This process is one of
        the most subtle in Nature or Art, though the Elixir has not the
        properties assigned to it by the Sage, viz., that if you mix
        this complete medicine with any metal, and the product with
        another metal, the whole will be turned, according to the first
        principle, into the Lunar Medicine, and if the Sun be added
        thereto, this also will be converted into the Moon. Such
        property is not found in our Medicine if prepared in the way
        described. The quintessence is fixed permanently in the ferment
        to which it is joined, and transmutes in accordance with the
        ferment. If, after the tenth distillation, you dissolve gold in
        your water; then volatilize the water over a slow fire, and
        place the gold in a humid spot, it will be dissolved of its own
        accord in four days; and this solution is Potable Gold, which
        has such wonderful virtue in the conservation of human life. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you add to this dissolved gold a paste of
        quicksilver seven times sublimed with vitriol (the proportion of
        the gold being one part to seven of the quicksilver), and
        continue to sublime the mixture over the faeces till fixation
        takes place, you will have a penetrant and tingent Medicine. If
        you put one ounce of this liquid gold by itself for eight days
        over a very gentle fire, with 100 parts of Mercury, it will
        coagulate the whole into gold. All these wonders are brought
        about by the spirit of the water which is indissolubly fixed
        with the gold, in the solution of the gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distill the Vegetable Stone till there is no
        viscosity in the water. This is the case after the fifth
        distillation. You will then have the best transparent vitriol
        and the best cinaprium in equal parts, which combine, triturate,
        dry in the sun, and after upon coals, till all aquosity has
        departed. Project your water thereon. Distil it over a slow and
        gradually increasing fire: thus the spirit of the quintessence
        of vitriol, and conaprium, or antimony, which mainly constitutes
        the Mineral Stone, is mixed with the spirit of our blessed
        ardent water, which is the spirit of the Vegetable Stone. Repeat
        the distillation the times, always letting the bodies be dry
        before you add the water. Let the spirit remain, and by means of
        the fire be joined to the spirit of the burning water. When you
        have accomplished the tenth distillation, counting from the
        first distillation of the ardent water, add gold in the
        proportions explained above for the work of the Vegetable Stone.
        Place in the furnace. In ten days the fixation the fixation will
        be completed, whereas, in the ordinary vegetable process, 25 are
        required. This abridgment does not impair the virtue of the
        Stone for transmuting metals, but reduces its medicinal potency.
        Yet, of course, the Medicine will be better and more efficacious
        all round, if it be prepared in the ordinary, more tedious
        manner. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have thus produced fixation,
        perform the dissolution in the bath, just as in the case of the
        Vegetable Stone. But this composite stone is not dissolved so
        quickly as the Vegetable itself; yet it is quicker dissolved
        than is the Mineral, namely, in nine days. A penetrating and
        well-fixed medicine is the best for all purposes; the more
        quickly it penetrates bodies, the more readily it is joined to
        them, and the more thorough its action, Out of fine black lead
        of the Sages you may extract a certain oil of golden colour,
        which if used for the dissolution of the Stone, whether mineral,
        composite, or animal, after its fixation, and solution for 3 or
        4 days, will enable you to dispense with all other solution and
        coagulation. For this is the occult oil which makes our Medicine
        penetrable, friendly, and capable of union with all bodies. If
        you know how to free this oil of its water; and treat it in the
        manner suggested, you can evolve from it the Stone in 30 days.
        But in regard to the Vegetable Stone this oil is not needed,
        because there the processes are expeditious enough. From this
        brief epistle I must leave you to gather what you want.
        Farewell. </p>
      <p><i>Notes of Lacinius on the Epistle of Raymondus.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me state, in explanation of Raymond’s
        Epistle, that all his works are full of that Vegetable Stone,
        which he often calls Vegetable Mercury, the water of life, the
        menstruum, and the menstrual blood, and of which he says it has
        the properties of a body, and is produced, as it were, out of
        the female seed: it is both generative and nutritive, and it
        causes the growth of gold and silver, educing them from
        potentiality into activity, and thus at length changing them
        into the Stone. If it causes gold, etc., to grow, it must be by
        its dissolution --- hence it is that which dissolves bodies,
        which, however, must first be calcined and volatilized. But his
        cannot be done by a vegetable product, as foolish persons
        suppose, but with things of a like nature. Raymondus distinctly
        discountenances such a view. He says that the whole mystery of
        the mineral way consists in two waters, one of which volatilizes
        the Stone (which is fixed), while the other water fixes it
        again, and is also fixed with it by the skill of the artist. The
        quintessence which composes the whole Stone is fixed and
        fortified according to the ferment joined to it, and performs
        transmutation accordingly. But it is possible to fix the
        quintessence over its own earth and join it with the metal; yet
        this method does not find favour with Raymondus, because when it
        is fixed upon another ferment, the work is performed quicker,
        its potency is greater, and it is more natural. --- What
        Raymondus here alludes to as the quintessence, is by Rhasis
        described under the name of armoniac salt. With his menstruum,
        or salt, Raymond extracts from metals their souls, which he
        calls sulphur of Nature. He causes them to ascend and cling to
        the sides of the vessels by means of fire. The extract he often
        terms the metallic sperm, from which again he extracts the four
        elements, with his circulatory, celestial medicines, by the help
        of digestions and distillations. These elements he fixes,
        solves, and coagulates on his earth; and thus he composes the
        Stone. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the present you may operate in the
        following manner. Make a water out of vitriol, saltpeter, and
        cinabrium. Sublime one pound of this water with half-a-pound of
        cinabrium three times, always adding fresh cinabrium. Then
        rectify it by itself that it may be well purified. Take that
        pure water, and mix with it as much actuated vegetable water
        with its sublimed earth; mix them gradually and carefully, and
        let them stand in a well-sealed vessel for 24 hours. Then
        distill all the water in a bath; pour it on again, and distill
        again, till the mineral spirit is well united to the vegetable
        spirit, and you will see them lying at the bottom like a piece
        of ice. Pour away the distilled water since we need it no more.
        The strength of the ice, or spirit, you can intensify by
        repeated distillations in the bath, with more water. Put one
        pound of aqua fortis over one ounce of that salt --- do the same
        with the water of life, which must be highly rectified, and you
        can increase the potency of the ice, or rather fire, almost
        indefinitely. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of this ice one pound, pound it with
        one ounce of volatile Sol, reduced to the nature of a spirit, by
        the mediation of menstrual water conformed to its nature. Now
        this water, which volatilizes the Stone, is not really water of
        life. But when you have gold or silver thus volatile or foliate,
        the same is disposed for dissolving or uniting with the ice.
        Distill for eight days in the bath, and the whole is dissolved
        into a liquid of a golden colour; make it circulate for 20 days
        in a double vessel; it will then coagulate as a ruby-coloured
        Stone; distil, dissolve, and coagulate, and you have the
        Medicine. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution is the root of Alchemy. Hence we
        must discover the natural solvents and coagulants. We will,
        therefore, proceed to speak of soluble and solvent mineral
        substances --- of atraments and alums, of mineral spirits, of
        metals and precious stones --- their nature, the method of
        solution and coagulation, etc. </p>
      <p><i>On Atramneta.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atraments are either black, reddish, or
        green; and they are all hot and dry. They are likewise secret
        and wonderful in their nature. The green atrament mixed with
        quicksilver coagulates it, and nothing else will bring about the
        same effect. If also very quickly sublimes quicksilver,
        mortifies it, and renders it liquid. Believe what I say, open
        your eyes, and try. The preparation of water of atrament is as
        follows: Take of green ultramontane atrament, shake it, place it
        in a jar, which you shall close up with clay; plunge the jar in
        coals, and expose it to gentle heat for two hours. Quicken the
        fire with the bellows for two hours longer; then leave it till
        it goes out of its own accord; allow the air to cool, open it,
        and you will find an atrament of an intense ruby colour. Place
        in a glass vessel; put over it a threefold quantity of clear
        boy’s urine or sweet water, cove it up, and keep it for use. </p>
      <p><i>On Alums.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many species of alum. The Jamen
        variety is feathery, very white, and acid. This is well-suited
        for dissolving purposes. Hence the Sages have called it the
        Stone of the Sages, because it is neither too hard nor too soft.
        It is not easily soluble, and is regarded as approaching a
        vegetable nature. There is another alum which is green, and in
        the form of a powder; one is of an orange colour, and one is
        whitish. There is also a rock alum, like sal gemmae. But the
        first is the most useful in our Art. Take of it as much as you
        want, pound it gently into a brazen mortar, place it in a brazen
        pot, pour over it six times its quantity of clear boy’s urine,
        expose it to a gentle heat: half the urine must evaporate; then
        remove it from the fire, strain it through a filter, place in a
        glass vessel, and keep for use. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alum is prepared with distilled boy’s urine,
        there being one part of alum to four of urine, in which it must
        be dissolved after pounding. Then, in order that the operation
        may succeed, distillation by the filter and congelation must be
        repeated several times. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare common salt, whence all salts
        originate, pour over it five times its quantity of sweet hot
        water; distill it, strain it through a filter, and coagulate.
        Repeat this operation several times till you have it in the form
        of snow-white crystals. </p>
      <p><i>Of Salts.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In armoniac salt are hidden all the secrets
        of the Sages, and because of its soaring nature, they have
        called it the Eagle, or the Arrow. It is very hot and very dry;
        yet it is nothing but condensed vapour collected from soot in
        baths. There is also sal gemmae, which is more precious than
        other salts, and very efficacious in our Art. Other salts are
        saltpeter and common salt. The purer salt is the greater its
        efficacy. One salt the Sages have essayed to hide. It is the
        salt alchali. If you can obtain it, you have all you want. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take one part of common salt, pound it, put
        it in a pot, cover it well, place the pot in a potter’s furnace
        all night, take out the salt, pound it, put it in a glass
        vessel, pour over it some of your water of atrament before
        referred to, if it be for the Red Tincture, or of the water of
        alum for the White Tincture. Let this water be twice or thrice
        the quantity of the salt. Leave it for eight days; that which is
        not dissolved sinks to the bottom, the rest rises to the
        surface, floats there like oil, and is brilliantly white. This
        latter they call the oil of the Sages or the water of wisdom,
        because none save a philosopher can apprehend it, being in
        appearance pure water, yet holding therein a crystalline vapour.
        When this water is coagulated, we obtain a brilliant Stone,
        which is called sal alchali. Take common salt, cook it, place it
        in a glass vessel, pour over it three times as much distilled
        vinegar or clear water, add half the quantity of alum
        zucharinum, and as much tartar of wine mixed with alum, pound
        them, put them in a glass vessel, pour over them three times as
        much distilled vinegar, or clear water, add two ounces of honey,
        leave it three days; then take what is dissolved, namely, what
        floats, having no faeces, over the clear and limpid slat, and
        place it in a small vessel, having a narrow neck. Add to it what
        floats on the surface of the lime and alum; place them in the
        same bottle, with the water of salt. See that you have no
        faeces, which will spoil the work. Coagulate the contents, and
        you have a brilliant crystalline stone. What has been said of
        common salt applies to saltpeter and sal gemmae. The oftener the
        salt is dissolved and refined, the better. </p>
      <p><i>Of salt armoniac.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pound it, put in a pot, cover same, expose
        to gentle heat, pound again, place in a glass vessel, pour over
        it twice the quantity of distilled vinegar, or clear water; add
        water of atrament for gold, water of alum for silver, and leave
        it eight days; skim off what floats on the surface and is
        limpid, being careful to take up none of the sediment; put in a
        narrow-necked bottle, coagulate, then keep it and preserve it
        from dust, because it is clear and white. Afterwards pound it,
        pace in aludel, having burnt common salt at the bottom; close
        vessel with the lute of wisdom. Sublime in furnace. If this
        operation be begun at early dawn, the fire which at first be
        very gentle, should be slightly increased at the third hour, and
        so till noon. Remove it from the fire, and let it cool. You will
        find the salt armoniac of a pure and brilliant white. It should
        be carefully shielded from dust. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Spirits.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three mineral spirits:
        quicksilver, sulphur, and arsenic. Arsenic is hot and dry, of
        great virtue and potency, yet lightly esteemed. It burns up all
        other bodies. There are two kinds of arsenic, one is of a pale
        white, the other red. The red is combustive, the white is
        solvent, and useful for the Tincture; with quicksilver it makes
        silver. It has a fiery nature, and sublimes quickly. This spirit
        we strive to render corporeal and fixed, in order that it may
        permanently colour our substance. It has great affinity for
        vinegar. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This spirit must be cleansed, sublimed, and
        exalted; then it will do what no man would think possible. Take
        pallid <i>arsenic</i>, pound well into powder, place in a
        glazed pot, pour over it four times as much clear strong
        vinegar. When most of the <i>arsenic</i> is dissolved, after
        three days, place over a gentle fire, steam off the liquid, take
        it out, place in a dish, wash well of all saltness with pure
        water, and dry in the sun. Place again in a glazed pot, pour
        over it four times its quantity of water of alum, and let it
        evaporate over the fire. Put in an aludel, add twice its
        quantity of common purified salt, close the vessel, and seal it
        up carefully. Sublime cover fire from morning till noon. Cool,
        open the vessel, and you will find in it a brilliant substance.
        Place it in a glass vessel, pour over it its own quantity of
        water of alum, and leave for eight days. Take up what floats on
        the surface, put it in a small narrow-necked bottle, coagulate,
        and you will find a crystalline stone; keep until necessary to
        use, and see that it is free from dust. If you digest this <i>arsenic</i>
        with milk or oil of bitter almonds, and afterwards with water of
        alum, it will be very brilliant and beautiful in the
        sublimation; and then it dissolves very easily. If arsenic be
        cooked with olive oil, and then with water of atrament, it will
        be found in the sublimate brilliantly red and easily soluble.
        Red <i>arsenic</i>, when its ferment is added, makes glad the
        heart of the Alchemist; but it is not so easily dissolved as
        white flaky <i>arsenic</i>. Hence you should use the later for
        dissolving and sublimation. To sublime with quicksilver, cook in
        the manner described one pound of arsenic with one ounce of
        quicksilver. </p>
      <p><i>Of Sulphur.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decoction of sulphur is the same as that
        of <i>arsenic</i>. But as sulphur has much air, as well as much
        hotness and dryness, it is not easily sublimed. To effect this
        purpose, cook it well, and dissolve it; you will then be on the
        road to perfection. Without the three substances which I have
        mentioned, there can be no silver or gold, <i>arsenic</i> being
        best for silver, and sulphur for gold. Some say that if sulphur
        be mixed with living calx, it can be easily sublimed; but I do
        not wish you to waste your labor. Know, however, that arsenic is
        more valuable in the Lunar, and sulphur in the Solar work.
        Sulphur is partially white without, and partially red within. Of
        <i>arsenic</i> the opposite holds good. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to change white into red
        sulphur, dissolve it in red water by pounding, saturation, and
        good decoction; coagulate into a stone, dissolve once more with
        red water, again coagulate, dissolve a third time, sublime over
        a powerful fire, and that which ascends in the shape of a white
        dust is white sulphur; what remains at the bottom is red
        sulphur, which transmutes quicksilver into gold. </p>
      <p><i>Of Quicksilver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sages have striven to make quicksilver
        remain firm in the fire; but it is impossible. Mix qucksilver
        with anything, and the fire will instantly separate them again,
        because it is a spirit, and has been called the cloud of clouds,
        the father that enriches the son, the eye of wisdom; the
        pregnant woman that conceives and brings forth in a day. It says
        to gold: I and sulphur have begotten you; and to silver: I and <i>arsenic</i>
        are your parents. I flee from the fire, and leave behind all
        that does not belong to me in the shape of a sediment. I stand
        firm in the fire, and make all that belongs to me brilliant and
        pure; I, being coagulated coagulate, being dissolved dissolve.
        This seeming contradiction I will now explain, and tell you of
        its coagulation into the white, and of its dissolution. Let it
        first be cleansed with vinegar and salt, ten times sublimed or
        coagulated, then dissolved. Take it and an equal quantity of
        common salt, place in a glazed pot (after pounding them well in
        a glass mortar), pour over it four times as much vinegar, and
        leave it over a gentle fire till all the vinegar has evaporated.
        Place in dish, having removed it from the fire, wash with pure
        water, rinse out salt. Take the same quantity of atrament or
        vitriol, pound together, place in an aludel, and make paste with
        pure water, or distilled vinegar. Dry over gentle fire, place in
        an aludel, and carefully stop up the mouth of the vessel with
        clay. Leave over slow fire from morning till the third hour; let
        the fire be stronger from the third hour till noon, or none.
        Cool, open the vessel, and you will find it full of a snow-white
        substance (like camphor in appearance). Pound, place in glass
        vessel, pour over it twice its quantity of water of atrament,
        and leave for eight days. Skim off what float on the surface
        into a small narrow-necked bottle, coagulate, and you will have
        a clear red granulated substance. Keep it free from dust till
        needed. Item: take 3 ounces of olive oil in a glazed pot; boil
        up over slow fire; when it begins to boil, throw in 1/2 ounce of
        clear yellow sulphur, shake till sulphur melts, remove from
        fire, and cool. Add 1 ounce of quicksilver, put on fire, leave
        till all is dry, take out of pot, and place in a vessel well
        stopped up with the clay of the Sages. Sublime over fire from
        morning till three p.m., and what is in the vessel will then be
        very red. Pound, place in glass vessel, pour over it twice as
        much water of atrament, leave for eight days, skim off what
        floats on the surface, place in bottle, coagulate, and you will
        have a clear red granulated substance. Keep this also free from
        dust until needed. If you wish to coagulate quicksilver into the
        white substance, in order to make silver, take quicksilver and
        as much white lead (cerusa); pound in a mortar, place in glazed
        pot, pour over it four times as much water of alum or of
        quicklime, leave over gentle fire from 6 till 9 a.m. Take out of
        pot, pound, place in an aludel, stop up with clay of the Sages.
        Put in glass furnace or baker’s oven, or over fire, leave from
        morning till evening, cool, open, and you will find the lower
        part of the vessel full of ashes. Pound, place in glass vessel,
        pour over it twice its quantity of water or alum, leave for
        eight days, skim off oil of Sages, place in small bottle, and
        coagulate; you will find a white crystalline substance like ice;
        keep it, and you will soon know its use. </p>
      <p><i>Of Gold.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sages call gold the product of the sun.
        When it is perfect, the fire cannot hurt it, but rather
        intensifies its colour. If you wish to make gold, you must
        ferment it, or all your labour will be in vain. Moreover, the
        ferment must be pure. Nevertheless, it does not require much
        purification, since it is in itself sufficiently pure, but it
        must be prepared so that it may be easily incorporated and
        fermented, and for this purpose it must be calcined as we will
        shew further on. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat pure gold into thin leaves; then take
        red <i>arsenic</i>, pound, add a third part of common salt
        (i.e., one-third part of the <i>arsenic</i>), take seven ounces
        of steel filings, pound the three together; take a small, new,
        glazed pot, put a little of this powder at the bottom of the
        pot; over it place a plate of gold, cover the plate with more
        powder, and so fill up with alternate layers. Take another
        glazed pot, put in one pound olive oil, boil over a gentle fire,
        add four ounces of clear yellow sulphur; remove at once from the
        fire, stir with an iron rod till the sulphur is melted, and
        allow to cool. Add some of this oil to the contents of the other
        pot; simmer over gentle fire, till absorbed; add more, place
        again on the fire, and so on, little by little, till all the oil
        has been absorbed. Then leave it on the fire till quite dry. All
        this can be done in 24 hours. Stop up the pot with the clay of
        Sages; next morning, place the pot among the coals of a gentle
        fire, so that it is entirely covered, from 6 to 9 a.m. Take pot,
        cool, break it, pound its contents; afterwards pound the gold,
        place the whole in dish, add sweet and clear water, and stir it.
        When the powder has settled at the bottom, remove the water (for
        it is salt); add more water, till the powder has quite lost its
        saltness. Dry it in the sun, or by a fire, place in a small pot,
        stop up with clay, place in furnace for the space required for
        baking bread. Then rejoice, for you have pulverized and
        fermented gold. Take that powder, pound well, place in glass
        vessel, pour over it its own quantity of water of atrament,
        taking care that it is neither more nor less; leave for eight
        days, stirring twice or thrice daily. Skim off the brilliant
        substance floating on the surface, and put it in small bottle.
        It should be limpid and clear, and if it be so, happy are you.
        Take equal quantities of the water of quicksilver, as described
        in the chapters on quicksilver, of the water of salt armoniac,
        and of the water of gold; mix the three waters in a bottle;
        coagulate, plunge bottle up to neck in pot full of sieved ashes,
        place pot on tripod over fire from morning till evening, and
        that which is in bottle will be coagulated. Break the bottle
        after it has cooled, take the Stone which is inside, put half
        ounce of it on eighty ounces of silver, and it will be changed
        into the purest gold. </p>
      <p><i>Of Silver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver, though composed in the same way, is
        not quite so pure or well digested as gold, and suffers from two
        kinds of humidity, sulphureous and phlegmatic, or evaporant. Yet
        silver may be properly purified by fire; but if being cooked
        with common salt and <i>orpiment</i>, it grows black, while
        there is no blackness in the salt or the orpiment, this is a
        sign that it is suffering from the first humidity. The sign of
        the second humidity is diminishment in the fire. By purification
        and digestion it can be transmuted into gold, for its infirmity
        is of a negative kind. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is the best way of changing
        silver into gold. Between two layers of common well-pounded
        salt, without extracting its humidity, place a thin silver plate
        in a strong earthen vessel; leave a small opening at the mouth,
        plunge among moderately red-hot coals for twelve hours. Take
        out, and you will find your silver plates corroded and
        diminished in size and weight. If they are white, it is a sign
        that their first humidity has been consumed, and that they are
        well calcined and britle. If they are black upon the outside,
        some of the humidity remains. If they are not brittle, it is the
        second humidity which persists. The sign of elimination of the
        first humidity is that the silver is not blackened by lead; of
        the second that it does not diminish in fire. When the silver is
        well calcined, and freed of its sulphureous humidity, then
        expose it once more to fire, till it is soft and flexible like
        gold under the hammer, and is at the same time compact and
        ponderous. Take equal quantities of salt armoniac, saltpeter,
        and borax; pound together, dissolve in a little wine, and let it
        dry. This will rend the silver malleable. </p>
      <p><i>Proof.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhasis tells us that copper and iron, being
        of a different and most impure substance, can no more be changed
        into silver or gold than an ass or a goat can become a man. But
        copper is of a strong substance, and easily transmutable in
        colour, of the same weight with silver, and readily mixed with
        good silver. But it easily turns black, and is very impure. Yet
        even Rhasis admits that it is easier to make silver out of
        copper than gold out of lead. If copper, he says, be calcined,
        cleansed, and dissolved, it will look like gold, but will never
        become real gold. Hence he calls all Alchemists fools who hunt
        for bears in the sea, and angle for fish on dry land, as they
        will make gold of lead, or silver of copper, when they have made
        a wolf of an ass. Does not Rhasis here seem to characterize our
        whole Art as a sophistical invention? How is the difficulty to
        be solved? Well, if you wish to know all, read all --- and
        especially what Rhasis himself says in his chapter on copper.
        There you will perceive that his meaning appears to be that the
        ferment of gold and silver cannot be obtained from lead or
        copper; but he does not really deny that lead and copper can be
        transmuted </p>
      <p><i>Of Silver (continued).</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take thin plates of [pure] silver, five
        pounds of <i>arsenic</i>, and one ounce of steel filings; pound
        them well together. Take some of this powder, cover with it the
        bottom of a pot, put over that place a silver plate, over that
        some more of the powder, and so fill the pot with alternate
        layers of plates and powder. Let there be powder over the top of
        all. Place on a slow fire, over the coals, pour over it strong
        vinegar, and leave it from 6 to 9 a.m. Let the moisture
        evaporate, stop up with clay of Sages, and plunge pot among
        red-hot coals; keep up a powerful fire or 12 hours. Then open
        the pot (after cooling), separate the silver from the powder,
        pound in mortar, wash with clean water in a dish. Dry in the
        sun. Add to the powdered silver equal quantities of sal
        armoniac, of sublimed coagulated quicksilver, and of white
        sublimed arsenic; pound, put in a bottle, pour over it four
        times as much water of alum, and leave for two days. Plunge
        bottle up to neck, which should be narrow, in a pot full of
        ashes; the bole should be unstopped till its contents are
        coagulated. Then stop it up, and place over fire for 24 hours.
        Let it cool, and then break bottle; if anything be sublimed up
        to the neck, combine all together; pound its contents, place in
        glass vessel, pour over it twice as much water of alum, and
        leave for 8 days, shaking it twice or thrice every day. Skim off
        what floats on the surface into a small narrow necked bottle;
        evaporate the liquid from the remaining faeces, add one-half
        ounce of it to 20 ounces of copper, and it will become the
        purest silver. Coagulate the contents of the bottle in a pot
        full of ashes, then add one-half ounce of it to 250 ounces of
        copper, 150 ounces of tin, or 50 ounces of lead, and you will
        witness a wonderful transformation. There is another way of
        carrying out this operation, but here is the most efficacious,
        and however the coagulated substance the preparation of which I
        have described may be obtained, it has the property of
        transmuting larger or smaller quantities of copper, tin or lead
        into the most irreproachable silver. </p>
      <p><i>Of Copper.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of copper is identical with
        that of silver, but it is very impure and ill-digested, burnt,
        hot, and dry. It is also very porous, and must be well-cleansed
        of its prevailing sulphureous humidity. In is natural state it
        grows black in the fire, and is burnt and excoriated; it also
        burns and blackens other metals, on account of its sulphureity.
        When the purification begins, the flame is more yellow and less
        black. Its cleansing is accomplished in the same way as that of
        silver. Afterwards let it be extinguished with vinegar and fresh
        swine’s blood. It should be calcined longer than silver; and it
        should remain exposed to a powerful fire for three days. The
        saltness which persists after its calcinations you may remove
        with hot lye. </p>
      <p><i>Of Lead.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead is generated in the same way as other
        imperfect metals. It consists of impure sulphur and dark impure
        quicksilver, of weak digestion and composition. Its blackness
        and impurity may be extracted by continued digestion. This
        purgation may be performed by melting and adding to it
        one-fourth part of Mercury; then pulverize in mortar with an
        equal weight of burnt common salt, till the salt grows black.
        Then wash it out with water; pound again with an equal weight of
        salt, and so add salt a third time; boil it all up in strong
        vinegar for the first day, till it is the more purified of
        sulphur and blackness. Continue the operation till the lead is
        quite pure. </p>
      <p><i>Of Tin.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tin has white and partially impure
        quicksilver, with sulphur of great impurity. One-quarter of
        Mercury and a third part of lead will remove its porosity and
        toughness. But it must be imbibed with rectified oil, or with
        distilled swine’s blood, till its moisture is removed. Its
        purification may also be carried out, like that of lead, with
        burnt salt and vinegar. But Rhasis says that gold and silver are
        evolved out of it with greater difficulty than out of any other
        metal. </p>
      <p><i>Of Iron.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron is composed, like other metals, of
        gross and impure sulphur and quicksilver. It may be changed into
        steel, but only with the greatest difficulty into gold and
        silver. It may be founded with ceruse, but is not malleable
        after fusion. It is most useful in supplying that crocus which
        is of so great importance in our Magistery. </p>

        <b><i><font size="+1">Extracts of Lacinius from Albertus Magnus,
              St Thomas, and Other Great Sages.</font></i></b></center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only to inexperienced and superficial
        readers can there appear to be any disagreement among the
        different exponents of this Art. From Hermes, who calls the
        dissolved Body a perennial water which coagulates Mercury, down
        to the latest Sage, they are all in wonderful substantial
        harmony. The matter of which they speak is the flower of
        flowers, the rose of roses, the lily of lilies. Rejoice then,
        young man, in they youth, and learn to collect flowers, because
        I have brought you into the garden of Paradise. Make wreath for
        your head, rejoice, and enjoy the delights of this world,
        praising God, and helping your neighbor. I will now open to you
        the fount of knowledge, and make you to understand the dark
        things of this Art. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albertus instructs us, first, to collect the
        flowers, i.e., purge the spirits, then to fix them by repeated
        sublimation in a closed vessel, then to dissolve, and then to
        coagulate. First, we will speak in general, </p>
      <p><i>Of Spirits.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transmutation of metallic bodies is
        brought about by the mineral spirits, whose abundant purity and
        digestion impart to them great potency of digestion and
        purification. By a spirit we mean that which has a natural
        potency in vivifying and rendering immutable. It is surely not
        surprising that a most highly purified and matured spirit should
        effect striking changes in the body of a metal. The quantity of
        the metal is indeed very much larger, but the qualities of the
        spirit are active, while those of the metals are passive, and so
        very little can cause a very great effect. In order, however,
        that spirits may have this power, it is necessary to purify and
        digest them very highly, to introduce them into metallic bodies,
        and to make it impossible for them to leave such bodies. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preparation of spirits is sufficiently
        exemplified for us by the way in which metals are naturally
        procreated. In the natural generation of gold, the spirit is
        sublimed by the mineral heat of the earth. The dry earth, when
        heated, heats the impurities, drinks up the superfluities, and
        retains the grosser parts. The watery, aerial, and igneous
        parts, being more subtle and volatile, ascend upward. By
        imitating Nature, Art has invented a sublimation through which
        we purify spirits by means of the dry element that consumes
        their superfluities. Nature prematurely sublimes some
        quicksilver and sulphur in the bowels of the earth by premature
        coagulation into iron, for her own purposes. I., however, who
        wish to purify the sulphur and the quicksilver, can put off the
        coagulation until the spirits are freed from all grossness and
        humidity by reiterated sublimation. Nature, when aided by man,
        is much more powerful than when left to herself. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Purification of the Spirits.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purification of spirits consists in the
        removal of all superfluities, but without the corruption of
        essentials. There are three kinds of spirits, mineral,
        vegetable, and animal. The mineral spirits, again, are properly
        three: sulphur, quicksilver, and <i>arsenic</i>, which operate
        naturally in metals, and to which metals, prepared by Art, are
        naturally joined. Of these, sulphur is the great active
        principle, while <i>arsenic</i> represents the secondary
        operations of quicksilver --- but all three unite in the
        composition of the Elixir. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulphur is an oleaginous body composed of
        subtle earth, strongly saturated with water, and a fat,
        unctuous, airy humidity, capable of fusion by heat, and by
        coagulation by cold. It has three humours, two of which are
        superfluous, while one is necessary. What we have to do is to
        purge out the superfluous humours, leaving the third
        indissolubly united to the purified earth. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take pure and brilliant sulphur, pound
        small, incorporate with an equal quantity of common salt, cook
        over gentle fire for two hours, stirring it well all the time,
        till the mixture becomes a black mass. Allow to cool: take good
        strong lye, made of plain water combined with quicklime and vine
        ashes. Pulverize sulphur and salt, boil with lye water over a
        fierce fire, stirring often, till all the salt is extracted,
        with the unctuosity thereof. Dry the sulphur, add more salt in
        the same proportion as before, and repeat the last operation.
        Reiterate three times, then sublime in the following way: Boil
        alum in an earthen pot over a strong fire for half an hour, when
        it will be calcined. Add an equal quantity of iron or copper
        filings, sprinkle with vinegar, and mix well. With two parts of
        this compound combine one part of sulphur, and again moisten
        with vinegar, Dry in sun, or by a slow fire, and place in vessel
        thus: Cover the bottom an inch thick with the mixture of alum
        and iron filings, then put in the sulphur, etc., and over that
        another layer of the mixture. Boil over gentle fire for three
        hours: stop up mouth of vessel, increase fire gradually till
        twenty-fourth hour, cool, collect what is sublimed. The fire
        should be gentle at first and strong afterwards. Take care to
        stir the contents of the vessel frequently, and let it be well
        raised above the fire to prevent the compound from getting
        burned. Repeat the sublimation seven times, till the sulphur
        becomes quite white, dry, and clear from all humidity of a
        corrupt kind. The sign of this perfection is a crystalline
        brightness and brilliancy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fixed and completed in the following
        manner. Take strong, thrice distilled vinegar; mingle with it
        the aforesaid purified sulphur, and one-fifth part of its weight
        of thrice-sublimed salt armoniac. Mingle all with the vinegar in
        a porphyry jar. Put in a long-necked glass phial, close, plunge
        in horse-dung, till all is dissolved. Congeal into ashes with
        the mouth of the phial open. Continue slow fire till all is
        coagulated: then you will have sulphur which tinges, and remains
        fixed in the fire. With it you can transmute Mercury, Venus, and
        Jupiter into silver. </p>
      <p><i>Of Quicksilver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quicksilver is a mineral body, composed of
        subtle sulphureous earth, mixed with water, which is partly
        elementary, partly metallic. Its earthy substance must be purged
        o its gross sulphureous earthliness, and its aqueous substance
        of its twofold superfluous humidity. When it is thus purified it
        unites with purified sulphur to produce the glorious Elixir, and
        the complete perfection of gold and silver, just as the female
        menstrual blood combines with the male sperm to make a man. </p>
      <p><i>Its Preparation.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project quicksilver on its father, coagulate
        a little, pound, incorporate with a double quantity of its
        sediment; place in sublimatory between two layers of sediment;
        when fully steamed, shut up vessel, and place over fire
        gradually increasing in strength. The sediment consists of one
        part of common salt, and one part of black or green atrament,
        and one part of cuperosa. Let it be seven times, or oftener,
        sublimed with this sediment, till it loses all superfluous,
        earthy humidity, and becomes very white. At first let it be
        pounded with its sediment, till it dies. Sprinkle with vinegar
        or urine. Place over very gentle fire, for it burns easily.
        Before you open the sublimatory, let it cool, because its vapour
        is very deadly. However much Mercury is purified by sublimation,
        it does not penetrate the body of a metal, or remain there,
        after the manner of sulphur or arsenic. Its substance, though
        very pure, is not easily fusible: their fusibility metals owe to
        their sulphur rather than their quicksilver. It is, therefore,
        necessary to incerate and to loosen. Sal ammoniac, saltpeter,
        borax, capillary oil, and oil of eggs are the best media for
        creation, to which also contrition is eminently needful, for it
        subtilizes parts and causes them to penetrate one another. Take
        highly purified Mercury with one-seventh it weight of salt
        armoniac, thrice sublimed with a equal quantity of common salt;
        sprinkle with rectified hair oil in the place wherein it is
        being dried. Dry in glass vessel among ho ashes, or in the sun.
        Pound and sprinkle with hair oil, and again dry. Again pound and
        make a paste with oil, and dry. The sign of creation is that the
        substance flows like wax when poured upon a plate of silver. The
        above operation must be repeated, if necessary, until this is
        accomplished. Take strong, thrice-distilled vinegar (to which
        add one-tenth part of thrice-sublimed salt armoniac); make a
        paste, place in glass vessel, close carefully, plunge in horse
        dung, and then leave on gentle fire about 26 days; take out,
        strain, coagulate among hot ashes into a hard and dry mass,
        leaving the vessel open till all humidity disappears. Test by
        placing on red-hot iron plate: if it remains undiminished and
        gives out no smoke, it is properly fixed. If it gives out smoke,
        it is not fixed, and you must repeat the coagulative process.
        The Mercury may be changed into Moon by the method described in
        the section on sulphur. If on this well-coagulated Mercury you
        place and equal amount of common Mercury with one-tenth or
        one-seventh of thrice-sublimed salt armoniac, and make a paste
        with hair or egg oil, and dissolve and coagulate, it will more
        readily be fixed. To obtain the red substance, make the paste
        with oil, one-fourth part of the aforesaid sulphur, with
        one-seventh part of salt armoniac, and one-third of lime and red
        oil (hereafter to be described); dissolve and coagulate as
        aforesaid. If projected on the Moon, it will transmute into true
        gold. </p>
      <p><i>Of Arsenic.</i> </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arsenic</i> is a mineral body composed of
        earth and water; it is oleaginous, like sulphur, but having more
        earth than oil, and containing a more gross and earthy sulphur.
        Its purgation for the first sublimation is by means of
        substances which dry up and consume its oleaginous superfluity,
        which is the first humidity. The aqueous superfluity, which is
        the second humidity, must be evaporated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In God’s name, take ponderous, lucid, red or
        yellow <i>arsenic</i>, pound small with an equal weight and a
        half of iron or copper filings; sprinkle with vinegar, dry,
        place between layers of its sediment over a fire, till there be
        no more steam, close up vessel, increase fire more and more till
        all is sublimed; cool, collect what appears outside the
        sediment, place between new layers, in each case about the
        thickness of one inch; sublime as before, till it is white,
        pure, crystalline, and free from all humidity and superfluity.
        This may be done by means of five or six sublimations; dissolve,
        and then coagulate, as in the case of sulphur, whether for the
        white or red. <i>Arsenic</i> is of less potency in the
        coagulation of Mercury than sulphur, but it is possible to
        extract from it an igneous virtue. </p>
      <p><i>How the Abovesaid Purified Sulphur changes Mercury, Copper,
          and Tin into Silver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take one pound of living Mercury, five
        pounds of melted purified tin, amalgamate, pulverize in marble
        mortar with an equal quantity of common baked salt, till the
        salt is quite black. Wash with water, till all blackness
        disappears; dry, add salt again, etc., and repeat the process
        till the salt and the water cease to become black. Add again an
        equal quantity of salt, cook over a slow fire, pound for an hour
        till the salt gets dry; when the Mercury begins to volatilize,
        project and pound as before, until no more blackness appears.
        Again wash and dry. Thus Mercury and tin are purified of their
        sulpureous blackness by constant poundings and assations with
        salt. I myself have found it necessary to repeat the cleansing
        operation twelve times! Then let both be fused together (i.e.,
        the Mercury and the tin); project into one mass one-seventh part
        of our prepared fixed and purified sulphur; hold it there with
        pincers till it is all dissolved. Remove quickly from fire,
        plunge in distilled vinegar, and the mass will be found white,
        soft, and friable. Place it in an earthen vessel, having an
        aperture at the top for the reception of the vessel containing
        the matter, which close; place on fire for thrice 24 hours, in
        order that the mass may be well-digested by the fire and the
        sulphur; after a time turn the vessel upside down, lest the
        Mercury should escape the influence of the coagulating sulphur.
        Thus the whole mass is changed into white, pure, malleable, and
        fixed Silver. Note that borax is to be preferred before all
        things in the matte of consolidation and ductibility. </p>
      <p><i>How the Aforesaid Sulphur acts upon Tin.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melt tin, and give it a strong fire, till
        all the smoke has evaporated; boil in strong vinegar for half a
        day, strain through a rag, pound with an equal quantity of salt,
        till it grows black; renew salt twelve times, as above. Thus
        Jupiter will be prepared for the reception of the Medicine. Then
        add to the melted tin one-seventh its weight of sulphur, as
        before described, holding it with pincers till it is dissolved
        and incorporated therewith. Tin is rendered fusible and
        malleable as follows: Put some calcined borax in a saucepan over
        the fire, dissolve in good wine, plunge in it the lime of tin,
        boil up till all the wine evaporates; then saturate the lime
        with swine’s blood, blow the fire, and it will presently melt,
        and be ready to receive the medicine, after the reception of
        which you will see Jove amiable and well-composed, without
        harshness, and fit to be the companion and friend of the
        prepared Moon. The Moon, thus prepared, is first purged with
        lead, afterwards projected upon rods, ignited ten times, and as
        often extinguished in swine’s blood; it is them laminated, and
        melted with a little borax, again projected upon rods, set on
        fire ten times as before, once more laminated and melted. Its
        purgation is now complete, a tenth part of sulphur is added to
        it in fusion, and this is the Moon which the friend of Jove as
        aforesaid. </p>
      <p><i>How the Aforesaid Sulphur acts on Venus.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take copper prepared in the right way, add a
        tenth part of the aforesaid sulphur; it will come forth citrine.
        Then project upon rods immersed in swine’s blood, when the
        copper will have all the more prominent properties of silver,
        and mix well with it. To change this silver into gold, be guided
        by the following instructions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take sulphur, pound small, cook over a
        gentle fire in an earthen vessel for seven days, till the orange
        colour disappears; and you must boil it in refined and distilled
        urine. Let the fire be moderate, so that the unctuosity may not
        go forth, but only the tincture, that is, the citrine colour.
        Remove the urine as it receives the colour of the sulphur, till
        all has been removed. Let all this be poured into a vessel, and
        distilled over a slow fire, till the water becomes first orange,
        then red. The white water which is first distilled we do not
        need; distill till you come to the black sediment, and keep that
        for another purpose. Herein is the Tincture. It is the fire
        chibric, which is a secret word. Take part of that fire, and
        distill the water which was firs orange, and then red, a second
        time. Boil the aforesaid fire in strong vinegar, cook over a
        gentle fire, till the cause of burning is extracted. For this
        purpose boil till the vinegar is consumed, add to it its dry,
        prepared fire, make a paste with three parts of the aforesaid
        white sulphur, adding one part of powdered slat armoniac;
        dissolve, coagulate, precipitate on prepared silver in the
        well-known manner, and it will be the best gold. </p>
      <p><i>On Vegetables and Animals.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been supposed, on the authority of St
        Thomas, that the Stone of the Philosophers is triplex ---
        mineral, vegetable, and animal. Their most approximate matte has
        never been expressly named by the Sages, but quicksilver has
        been assigned as that of the mineral, the quintessence of wine
        for the vegetable, and human blood for the animal. We will,
        therefore, now say a few words about the two Animal and
        Vegetable Stones, since these expressions are found in the
        writings of the Sages, and we wish our work to be as perfect as
        possible. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among vegetables, the first place is held by
        grain, spirit of wine, and salt of tartar; among sensible
        things, by human hair, blood, urine, and eggs. They must be pure
        of their kind, and then subjected to putrefaction, so that they
        may be divided among the four elements. After putrefaction
        dissolve and distil for 21 days, place over gentle fire in a
        cucurbite, collecting the white distilled water in a vessel by
        itself. The red and yellow water which is distilled should also
        be collected by itself. Inhumation in horsedung assists
        distillation. So continue the distillation till the steam ceases
        to rise, and only the black and dry earth remains in the
        alembic. The white water is called water simply; and the red
        water is called the water of life. Spirits are cerated,
        dissolved, coagulated, and fixed therewith. The whole water
        which had the citrine and the red, even to the dry faeces,
        contains water, air, fire, and oil. To prepare it, place the
        liquid without the black sediment in an alembic, and distill it
        over a slow fire. By this process there will be separated first
        the water and then the oil, which you may recognize by its
        viscosity, colour, and aerial lightness, as also by the fact
        that it floats in the water. In this second distillation you
        will find the fire as something red, black, and dry at the
        bottom, like the earth in the first distillation. In this way
        you separate the four elements. The water and oil are also
        rectified by distillation till they attain a crystalline
        brightness and brilliancy, without any sediment. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sediment of the second distillation,
        called fire, is thus rectified. Pound, dry in sun, calcine over
        a gentle fire, till it turns of an orange or red colour, the
        redder the better. To rectify the earth, pound the dry earth,
        saturate with its water, dry over slow fire, or in the sun,
        pound and imbibe till the earth has drunk twice the quantity of
        its water; dry it again, add seven times its quantity of water;
        repeat the operation a fourth time with seven times its quantity
        of water, calcine, saturate with a third part of the sevenfold
        quantity, place it in a glass vial, adding a modicum of bombax;
        dissolve in very warm horse-dung for three days, or more; take
        out, saturate with the remainder of that sevenfold quantity,
        calcine, and it will then be very yellow. By constantly
        repeating the saturation and calcinations, it will at length
        become very white, and a pearl of great price. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having rectified the four elements, prepare
        the elixir in the following way. Dry and pound well the
        aforesaid earth, saturate with its oil, i.e., its rectified air;
        dry, make liquid till it flows like wax on a red-hot copper
        plate; it will then have the properties of silver; pound it with
        its water, and dissolve in warm dung for three days; coagulate
        among hot ashes, and you have a most precious treasure. Of this,
        say the Sages, project one pound upon 100 pounds of prepared
        copper, and it will be changed into real, pure silver. If you
        wish to obtain the Elixir which will transmute into gold, follow
        the above instruction, but add to the three parts of rectified
        earth one of fire, and make a paste of all this with its oil, as
        described; dissolve and coagulate in the same way; project one
        pound on 50 pounds of prepared silver, and it will be transmuted
        into true gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hair and eggs must be putrefied under warm
        horse dung. Do not despise the putrefaction and dissolution of
        spirits in dung, for only in this way can they be properly
        digested. Not that the superior spirit of eggs is said to be in
        the outer shells, and they are whitened by calcinations only.
        They should in the first place be purged from the tela, then
        pounded and washed in a plain dish, and then paced in a strong
        earthen vessel with several small openings for the smoke to
        escape. Set the vessel over a powerful fire (such as is used in
        glass smelting) for a day and night; saturate with their water
        and oil till they become fluid&nbsp; like wax, pound this
        substance with its rectified water, dry, constantly pound and
        saturate, till it has drunk up its own weight of the water.
        Pound still, and dissolve in its own water. The oftener the
        Medicine is dissolved, the more efficacious will it be. O make
        the metal malleable, ductile, and amenable to the action of the
        Medicine, plunge ten times in swine’s blood, beat into thin
        plates, lay between layers of common salt and tartar of borax,
        pound with a moderate quantity of swine’s blood, and so make the
        metal fusible. The same process will render the metal harder if
        it be too soft. If the Medicine does not enter the metallic body
        properly, you may remedy the defect with oil of eggs and hair,
        and salt armoniac. If it enters well, but does not remain, this
        arises from a defect of fixation, and should be remedied by
        repeated inceration, dissolution, and coagulation. If it does
        not tinge well, its purification is at fault; repeat the
        sublimations, and add more of the metallic body. Moreover, the
        metals which are to be transmuted, must first be highly
        purified; and the Medicine itself must possess the utmost degree
        of purity and digestion. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that spirits may tinge permanently,
        they must first be cleansed, then sublimed, then incerated, then
        dissolved, and, lastly, reduced to a crystalline form. By means
        of sublimation the pure is removed from the impure. Bodies are
        calcined in order to purge out the accidents which corrupt the
        spirit, and impair the potency of the Tincture. Dissolution is
        practiced for the purpose of permanently uniting bodies to
        spirits. They are coagulated because powders are more easily
        used than water. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First dissolve bodies, then form a paste
        with the proper aqueous or liquid substance, and coagulate in
        the following manner. Close the vessel, place over warm ashes,
        leave for two days, till it is coagulated, then project a little
        of the coagulated substance on a red-hot pate, and if it
        evaporates, know that your operation has not been successfully
        performed. You must, therefore, add more of the body, and go
        trough the whole process over again. For unless the spirits are
        bound to the bodies by indissoluble links, they do not endure
        the test of the fire. Anyone, then, that would succeed in this
        Art, must understand sublimation, calcinations, dissolution,
        distillation, coagulation, inhumation, inceration; in a word,
        how to prepare baths, furnaces, and vessels. We will, therefore,
        briefly discuss these several operations. </p>
      <p><i>Inceration.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inceration is the saturating of a certain
        substance with some liquid for the purpose of dissolving or more
        closely uniting its parts, or of facilitating their mixture and
        purification, as when substances are saturated with a dessicaing
        and penetratn liquid (like common salt) before sublimation). </p>
      <p><i>Sublimation.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublimation takes place when anything is
        raised by air from the bottom to the upper part of the vessel.
        In the case of liquids, it is called distillation. It is used to
        make spirits more fit to receive the Medicine, the means being a
        slow and gradually increasing fire. It is also used to bring
        bodies into permanent union with spirits. Such bodies are first
        calcined, then sublimed with the spirits, and this operation
        requires a powerful fire from the first. </p>
      <p><i>Assation</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assation is to place incerated substances in
        a glass vessel, and to dry over hot ashes before the fire,
        taking care to stir the substance from time to time with a
        wooden stick. </p>
      <p><i>Calcination</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calcination is the pulverization of a
        substance by drying over a fire, and thus depriving it of is
        consolidating moisture. For there is not a full and perfect
        mixture of bodies and spirits, unless both are reduced to water
        which is the first matter of meals; but this cannot be done so
        long as they have their natural humidity, which causes the to be
        melted, liquefied, and moved in the fire, just like water, and
        holds continuous parts of the bodies in them, and strengthens
        them so that nothing can be administered to them whereby they
        can be reduced into water. When substances have thus been
        pulverized, they are more readily mixed, and saturated with
        moisture. </p>
      <p><i>Dissolution.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissolution is the reduction of a calcined
        body to water. The body must be first calcined, then saturated
        with dissolving water, then dried before the fire, then paced in
        a vessel where dissolution can take place; whatever still
        remains undissolved must again be prepared by the same series of
        operations. Dissolve by making a hole in a damp place, or in a
        stable, of the depth of two cubits; fill the hole full of water,
        till it is absorbed, and also put in some sand. Place in the
        hole the bottle having the substance to be dissolved; seal up
        bottle with wax; wrap up the same in straw; cover up the wax
        with moist sand, leave for seven days, or more, and the whole
        will be dissolved into water. Another dissolution is by means of
        St Mary’s bath. Repeat the operation, till it is perfectly
        accomplished. </p>
      <p><i>Distillation.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distillation is the purification of water
        that falls drop by drop, and is performed by means of a filter,
        or by steaming off a liquid over the fire, and condensing it
        again. It is also performed by water in St Mary’s Bath. </p>
      <p><i>Inhumation.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhumation is the placing of a soluble or
        dissolved substance in dug for purposes of dissolution (and then
        one part of the excrement of pigeons is mingled by means of
        vinegar with two parts of horse-dung), or for the purposes of
        developing an embryonic substance which has already begun to
        germinate. Make a hole two cubits deep and wide, where the wind
        cannot blow nor the sunshine; light in it a coal fire and keep
        up same for six hours. Take out the cinders, fill up the hole to
        the height of one foot with plain horse-dung, cover the side of
        the hole with a mixture of pigeon’s excrement and horse-dung.
        Place in the hole a box, which fill up inside with the mixed
        excrements; plunge a urinal into the box, and over this place a
        little dish; inside the urinal put the vessel with the substance
        to be dissolved, leave for seven days, pouring over it a
        quantity of hot water twice every day. </p>
      <p><i>Precepts of Albertus.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all I exhort you to be careful no to
        make any mistake, first in the pounding, then in the
        sublimation, then in the fixation, then in the calcinations,
        then in the dissolution, the in the coagulation. Perform all
        these operations properly, in their correct order, and you will
        not go wrong. If you reverse, or interfere with the order in any
        way, you are sure to get into difficulty. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore Albertus says: --- </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that before I found the truth, I fell
        into many errors and mistakes; and it was by constant trials,
        mistakes, and study that the secret was made known to me. I
        pored over the books of all the Sages, from Morienus, Aristotle,
        and Plato downward, but yet I went wrong, till by trials and
        mistakes I at length discovered the truth. For this reason I
        desired to set forth to you plainly all my discoveries, and I
        have put down nothing except what I have seen with my own eyes.
        I have shewn you the hidden treasure which many seek, and cannot
        find. I have manifested to you what was hidden in darkness, the
        Holy Stone, which is better than all other things in this world.

        <b><i><font size="+1">Curious Investigation Concerning the
              Nature of the Sun and Moon, from Michael Scotus.</font></i></b></center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we ask ourselves as a first question
        whether the gold of Alchemy be true gold or not, it would appear
        at first sight as if we must answer in the negative; because
        gold is properly generated in the bowels of the earth, and
        therefore, whatever is not so generated would not seem to be
        gold. Again, the substantial form can be introduced only by its
        own proper active principle, which is the Sun, but not the kind
        of sun or fire that alchemists use. Yet it should be remembered
        that the real question is whether there can be elicited from the
        Sun and Moon, by an artificial process, any seminal virtue which
        shall possess the power of hardening Mercury in a moment of time
        into gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in the first place, it is clear that
        such a seminal virtue can be extracted from gold. Every body,
        says St Augustine, contains certain seminal possibilities of a
        specific character, which will always produce certain given
        effects, whenever the requisite temporal, causal, and local
        conditions are fulfilled. God is the only Creator, but whoever
        provides bodies with certain conditions may produce, through
        their means, certain well defined effects. These seminal
        possibilities are called by some elementary virtues. We call
        them fermented spirits, because their action is hindered by the
        impurity of their bodies. But the spirit must be of a mineral
        kind, and all philosophers agree that the said mineral spirit is
        not a universal nature, nor yet is it Mercury in its whole
        substance, but in part it is such. Gold itself is altogether
        mineral, as is clearly apparent from its weight, and the ease
        with which it absorbs Mercury. Hence gold contains the radical
        seminal virtue which we seek; it is developed by digestive heat,
        and the impulse of an overruling Intelligence. </p>
      <p><i>Opinions on the First Substance of Gold and Silver.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place, some enquirers,, who
        observed the ease with which gold absorbs Mercury, were
        surprised to find that this Mercury, though highly purified, did
        not perfect the gold into to the Tincture. But those who know
        that there is no generation except where there is nutrition ---
        the generative virtue being the residue of nutrition --- thought
        of implanting this virtue by nourishing the gold, and thus
        stirring up its radical active principle. In order that a grain
        of wheat may fructify, it must die and, by the action of the
        sun, its substance, which is not more that of wheat than of
        stone, must be corrupted, and become fit to receive the form of
        wheat rather than that of stone, In the same way gold must
        putrefy so as to be reduced to its first matte, that it may
        become capable of germination. Many have said that this first
        substance of gold is sulphur and Mercury. But sulphur and
        Mercury are metals distinct from gold, and are not found where
        gold is found. We may rather say that an unctuous vapour,
        embodying the nature of both Mercury and sulphur, is the first
        matter of gold. Now, as a man is generated by his father through
        the medium of seed, and generates a son through the medium of
        seed, so gold, which is generated through this vapour, generates
        gold by means of this same unctuous vapour. Hence the Sages have
        called gold, when decomposed into its first matter sulphur and
        mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Of the Reduction of Gold into its First Matter.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this operation we must be quite sure that
        our methods are strictly in accordance with Nature; or we may
        destroy the body instead of perfecting it. Now, gold is earthy,
        and generically cold and dry, though, in comparison with other
        metals, is may be called hot and humid; therefore, we must look
        for special difficulties in transmuting it into a humid unctuous
        vapour. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be carefully calcined in a
        reverberatory furnace (so as to prevent fusion), and saturated
        with strong fiery waters. By this operation the surface humidity
        is corrupted, and there is generated a dryness, so that it is
        hot and dry. Earthy dryness, however, is inconsistent with the
        hotness of fire. Therefore, the first dryness is corrupted, and
        another more unctuous black dryness is generated. When Hermes
        says that the Stone ascends to heaven from the earth, i.e., is
        converted out of earth into fire, he means that gold, by means
        of calcinations, acquired the virtue of fire. Earth has dryness
        in common with fire; hence the conversion is all the easier, and
        then it once more descends from fire to earth. This latter
        effect is due to the operation whereby the calcined dry
        substance, through the mediation of our aerial water, by
        saturation has its dry nature corrupted, and an airy liquid
        nature is generated instead. Again the heat of fire is
        inconsistent with this humidity; hence it is corrupted and
        becomes a temperate moist warmth. Our vapour, then, is a
        substance intermediate between water and air. Thus gold returns
        to its root, and becomes a vapour, which is called the first
        matter of the Sun. Hence Geber, speaking to the artist, says in
        Med. Tert. Ord., c. 78: You have extracted the precious earth,
        and so that has come to pass which is meant by Hermes, when he
        says: It again descends from heaven, i.e., from fire to earth,
        i.e., to the first matter --- and thereby acquired the strength
        both of things above and of things below. He says that we must
        extract the four elements, i.e., stir up the seminal virtues, or
        the active and passive qualities. The vapour which results is
        called by a countless variety of names. </p>
      <p><i>Why it is called a Stone.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The substance has also been named after all
        the different varieties of salt, and this custom has given rise
        to many grievious errors. We prefer to call it a spiritual
        mineral virtue, as such a designation is less misleading, and
        implies that the gold has received the power of germination and
        propagation. But as every spirit is contained in a humid
        substance, the Sages have endeavored to convert this spiritual
        potency, by repeated solution and calcinations, into something
        humid and unctuous. Thus, elementary earth germinated through
        the frequent irrigation of rain descending from heaven. Thus,
        also, the heat and dryness of the earth gradually give way to
        fatness and moisture, as the rain continually ascends and
        descends. If it be denied that by such means gold can really be
        converted into vapour, Plato tells us that if it be impossible
        to convert it into fire, it must then become the next thing to
        it, which is air. If a figure cannot be made circular, the body
        must be reduced to its utmost limit of simplicity. That gold
        receives greater virtue by this process is clear from the fact
        that one ounce of prepared gold will fix one pound of spirit in
        one day, or, if the gold has been prepared ten times, it will
        fix one pound in an hour. </p>
      <p><i>Third Part.</i> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our third question is how this virtue should
        be sown. The earth in which it is best placed is a mineral
        nature, because we are fed and derive our growth from the things
        by which we are generated. What we need for this purpose is a
        mercurial virtue, and hence it must be sown in mercurial earth.
        This earth, however, must first be cleared, i.e., it must be
        purified and sublimed by means of a powerful fire, though all
        the time its essential part must be kept from combustion. The
        gentle fire which we need for this purpose, is one that
        conserves humidity, and perfects fusion. The seminal virtue must
        be strong enough to fix the spirits which are enclosed with it
        in the vessel; for so the virtue is multiplied and grows. But if
        the fire be too strong, the spirits escape and evaporate, and
        fixation cannot take place. What is fixed, fixes; what is
        coagulated, coagulates; our substance impregnates itself and is
        the most wonderful thing on earth. Sow the gold of the Sages,
        says Mary, when it has been philosophically prepared, in the
        earth of leaves, there it will grow, be nourished, and increase,
        like other plants. When you see that the process of fixation has
        begun to take place, then rejoice, for you are about to obtain
        your heart’s desire. But as only that sperm which is prepared in
        the vital liver generates in the case of animals, so only after
        long and patient digestion are our mineral spirits capable of
        producing our Stone. While the process of digestion is going on,
        the vessel must be kept carefully closed, or the spirits will
        escape; and as the fire must not be powerful, the operations
        must be frequently repeated over a gentle fire, in order to
        produce the same effect. When the Stone is once perfected, it
        may be indefinitely multiplied in quantity; e.g., one part,
        after the first sublimation, would perfect ten parts of common
        metal; if it be twice dissolved and coagulated, it perfects one
        hundred parts; if three times, it perfects two hundred parts; if
        twelve times, it tinges indefinitely. The solution, says Plato,
        takes place in the Moon, the coagulation in Saturn: and thereby
        our Stone acquires the virtue of all the planets. And again: the
        solution takes place in the water, the coagulation in the fire:
        thereby our Stone acquires the strength of the elements above,
        and of the elements below. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the fourth question (that of time), we
        say that those who wish to bring forth the child before the
        proper period produce an abortion. In order, then, that we may
        know when the time of perfection may be considered near, it is
        necessary to observe the signs of development in our Magistery.
        When the substance is in the white stage, it is more subtle than
        air, and more brilliant than snow. Not long afterwards it may be
        expected to reach the red stage. The addition of the orange
        colour, which is obtained from Mercury, is the only difference
        between the red Stone and the white. As a consequence, its air
        is more spiritual, its quicksilver more limpid, its fire more
        condensed, and its coldness more effectual. The white stage is
        brought about by constant sublimation and distillation through a
        filter; the red stage by the intensity of the calcined waters.
        In the second place, there must be constant solution by means of
        strong waters, and increasing assation. Then the substance must
        be liquefied and slightly coagulated. This must be followed by a
        subtle purification of the whole material. Next you should light
        a violent precipitatory fire. The sixth operation includes all
        that have gone before and perfects the Stone. If you add a grain
        of the Stone to a glass of sound wine, it cures leprosy, the
        itch, and all fevers, and purges all corrupt humours out of the
        human body, it straightens palsied limbs, and conserves youth.
        He who uses this medicine will always be merry and in ruddy
        health. Project one ounce upon 40 pounds of melted white or red
        Mercury, and it will at once be fixed and changed into silver or
        gold. It has also the virtue of rendering gems, diamonds, and
        precious stones far more beautiful, and of giving them a more
        intense colouring The medicinal efficacy of our Stone has been
        variously explained by the various Sages. Some regard it merely
        as an intensification of the power of gold to comfort and
        strengthen the heart of man. Some have compared it to the action
        of the magnet upon the steel; only both the magnet and the steel
        are, of course, mineral, while man and the Elixir belong to two
        different natural kingdoms. It is more reasonable, perhaps, to
        attribute the medicinal efficacy of our Stone upon the human
        constitution to the mystical influences which the heavenly
        bodies exert over both minerals and animals, and the same are
        found in our Stone in a specially concentrated form. But,
        however we may explain the fact, let us thank God that it is a
        fact, and that it has pleased Him to bestow so great a boon upon
        men. To Him be praise and glory in all eternity, world without
        end. Amen. </p>
