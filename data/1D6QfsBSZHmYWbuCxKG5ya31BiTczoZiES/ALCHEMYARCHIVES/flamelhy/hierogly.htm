      <p>Although that I, Nicholas Flammel, Notary, and abiding in
        Paris, in this year one thousand three hundred fourscore and
        nineteen, and dwelling in my house in the street of Notaries,
        near unto the Chapel of St. James of the Bouchery; although, I
        say, that I learned but a little Latin, because of the small
        means of my Parents, which nevertheless were, by them that envy
        me the most, accounted honest people; yet by the grace of God,
        and the intercession of the blessed Saints in Paradise of both
        sexes, and principally of St. James of Gallicia, </p>
      <p>I have not wanted the understanding of the Books of the
        Philosophers, and in them learned their so hidden secrets. And
        for this cause, there shall never be any moment of my life when
        I remember this high good, wherein upon my knees (if the place
        will give me leave), or otherwise, in my heart with all my
        affection, I shall not render thanks to this most benign God,
        which never suffereth the child of the just to beg from door to
        door, and deceiveth not them which wholly trust in his blessing.
      </p>
      <p>Whilst, therefore, I Nicholas Flammel, Notary, after the
        decease of my Parents, got my living in our Art of Writing, by
        making Inventories, dressing accounts, and summing up the
        expenses of Tutors and Pupils, there fell into my hands for the
        sum of two florins, a guilded Book, very old and large. It was
        not of Paper, nor of Parchment, as other Books be, but was only
        made of delicate rinds (as it seemed unto me) of tender young
        trees. The cover of it was of brass, well bound, all engraven
        with letters, or strange figures; and for my part I think they
        might well be Greek Characters, or some-such-like ancient
        language. Sure I am, I could not read them, and I know well they
        were not notes nor letters of the Latin nor of the Gaul for of
        them we understand a little. As for that which was within it,
        the leaves of bark or rind, were engraven, and with admirable
        diligence written, with a point of Iron, in fair and neat Latin
        letters, coloured. It contained thrice-seven leaves, for so were
        they counted in the top of the leaves, and always every seventh
        leaf was without any writing; but, instead thereof, upon the
        first seventh leaf, there was painted a Rod and Serpents
        swallowing it up. <br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>In the second seventh, a Cross where a Serpent was crucified; </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel6.gif" height="314" width="342"></p>
      </center>
      <p>and in the last seventh there were painted Deserts, or
        Wildernesses, in the midst whereof ran many fair fountains, from
        whence there issued out a number of Serpents, which ran up and
        down here and there. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel7.gif" height="310" width="347"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Upon the first of the leaves was written in great Capital
        Letters of Gold: Abraham the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levite,
        Astrologer, and Philosopher, to the Nation of the Jews, by the
        Wrath of Cod dispersed among the Gauls, sendeth Health. After
        this it was filled with great execrations and curses (with this
        word Maranatha, which was often repeated there) against every
        person that should cast his eyes upon it if he were not
        Sacrificer or Scribe. </p>
      <p>He that sold me this Book knew not what it was worth, no more
        than I when I bought it; I believe it had been stolen or taken
        from the miserable Jews; or found hid in some part of the
        ancient place of their abode. Within the Book, in the second
        leaf, he comforted his Nation, councelling them to fly vices,
        and above all, Idolatry, attending with sweet patience the
        coming of the Messias, who should vanquish all the Kings of the
        Earth, and should reign with his people in glory eternally.
        Without doubt this had been some very wise and understanding
        man. In the third leaf, and in all the other writings that
        followed, to help his Captive nation to pay their tributes unto
        the Roman Emperors, and to do other things, which I will not
        speak of, he taught them in common words the transmutation of
        Metals; he painted the Vessels by the sides, and he advertised
        them of the colours, and of all the rest, saving of the first
        agent, of the which he spake not a word; but only (as he said)
        in the fourth and fifth leaves entire he painted it, and figured
        it with very great cunning and workmanship: for although it was
        well and intelligibly figured and painted, yet no man could ever
        have been able to understand it without being well skilled in
        their Cabala, which goeth by tradition, and without having well
        studied their books. The fourth and fifth leaves therefore, were
        without any writing, all full of fair figures enlightened, or as
        it were enlightened, for the work was very exquisite. First, he
        painted a young men with wings at his ankles, having in his hand
        a Caducean rod, writhen about with two Serpents, wherewith he
        struck upon a helmet which covered his head. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel1.gif" height="334" width="342"></p>
      </center>
      <p>He seemed to my small judgment, to be the God Mercury of the
        Pagans: against him there came running and flying with open
        wings, a great old man, who upon his head had an hour-glass
        fastened, and in his hand a hook (or scythe) like Death, with
        the which, in terrible and furious manner, he would have cut off
        the feet of Mercury. On the other side of the fourth leaf, he
        painted a fair flower on the top of a very high mountain, which
        was sore shaken with the North wind; it had the foot blue, the
        flowers white and red, the leaves shining like fine gold: and
        round about it the Dragons and Griffons of the North made their
        nests and abode. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel2.gif" height="334" width="330"></p>
      </center>
      <p>On the fifth leaf there was a fair Rose-tree, flowered in the
        midst of a sweet Garden, climbing up against a hollow Oak; </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel3.gif" height="331" width="340"></p>
      </center>
      <p>at the foot whereof boiled a fountain of most white water,
        which ran head-long down into the depths, notwithstanding it
        first passed among the hands of infinite people, who digged in
        the earth seeking for it; but because they were blind, none of
        them knew it, except here and there one who considered the
        weight. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="flamel4.gif" height="330" width="336"></p>
      </center>
      <p>On the last side of the fifth leaf there was a King, with a
        great Fauchion, who made to be killed in his presence by some
        Soldiers a great multitude of little Infants, whose Mothers wept
        at the feet of the unpitiful Soldiers the blood of which Infants
        was afterwards by other Soldiers gathered up, and put in a great
        vessel, wherein the Sun and the Moon came to bathe themselves.
        And because that this History did represent the more part of
        that of the Innocents slain by Herod, and that in this Book I
        learned the greatest part of the Art, this was one of the causes
        why I placed in their Church-yard these Hieroglyphic Symbols of
        this secret science. And thus you see that which was in the
        first five leaves. I will not represent unto you that which was
        written in good and intelligible Latin in all the other written
        leaves, for God would punish me; because I should commit a
        greater wickedness than he who (as it is said) wished that all
        the men of the World had but one head, that he might cut it off
        with one blow. Having with me, therefore, this fair book, I did
        nothing else day nor night but study upon it, understanding very
        well all the operations that it showed, but not knowing with
        what Matter I should begin, which made me very heavy and
        solitary, and caused me to fetch many a sigh. My wife
        Perrenella, whom I loved as myself, and had lately married, was
        much astonished at this, comforting me, and earnestly demanding
        if she could by any means deliver me from this trouble. I could
        not possibly hold my tongue, but told her all, and showed this
        fair book, whereof at the same instant that she saw it, she
        became as much enamoured as myself, taking extreme pleasure to
        behold the fan cover, gravings, images, and portraits, whereof,
        notwithstanding she understood as little as I; yet it was a
        great comfort to me to talk with her, and to entertain myself,
        what we should do to have the interpretation of them. In the end
        I caused to be painted within my Lodging, as naturally as I
        could, all the figures and portraits of the fourth and fifth
        leaf, which I showed to the greatest Clerks in Paris, who
        understood thereof no more than myself: I told them they were
        found in a Book that taught the Philosophers' Stone, but the
        greatest part of them made a mock both of me and that blessed
        Stone, excepting one called Master Anselme, who was a Licentiate
        in Physic, and studied hard in this Science. He had a great
        desire to have seen my Book, and there was nothing in the world
        he would not have done for a sight of it: but I always told him
        I had it not; only I made him a large description of the Method.
        He told me that the first portrait represented Time, which
        devoured all; and that according to the number of the six
        written leaves, there was required the space of six years, to
        perfect the Stone; and then, he said, we must turn the glass,
        and seethe it no more. And when I told him that this was not
        painted, but only to show and teach the first agent, (as was
        said in the Book) he answered me that this decoction for six
        years space was, as it were, a second Agent; and that certainly
        the first Agent was there painted, which was the white and heavy
        water, which without doubt was Argent Vive, which they could not
        fix, nor cut off his feet, that is to say, take away his
        volatility, save by that long decoction in the purest blood of
        young Infants; for in that, this Argent Vive being joined with
        gold and Silver, was first turned with them into an herb like
        that which was there painted, and afterwards, by corruption,
        into Serpents; which Serpents being then wholly dried, and
        decocted by fire, were reduced into powder of gold, which should
        be the Stone. This was the cause that during the space of one
        and twenty years, I tried a thousand broulleryes, yet never with
        blood, for that was wicked and villaneous: for I found in my
        Book that the Philosophers called Blood the mineral spirit which
        is in the Metals, principally in the Sun, Moon, and Mercury, to
        the assembling whereof, I always tended; yet these
        interpretations for the most part were more subtil than true.
        Not seeing, therefore, in my works the signs at the time written
        in my Book, I was always to begin again. In the end, having lost
        all hope of ever understanding those figures, for my last refuge
        I made a vow to God and St. James of Gallicia, to demand the
        interpretation of them at some Jewish Priest in some Synagogue
        of Spain. whereupon, with the consent of Perrenella, carrying
        with me the Extract of the Pictures, having taken the Pilgrims'
        habit and staff, in the same fashion as you may see me without
        this same Arch, in the Church-yard in the which I put these
        Hieroglyphical Figures, where I have also set against the wall,
        on the one and the other side, a Procession, in which are
        represented by order all the colours of the Stone, so as they
        come and go, with this writing in French: Much pleaseth God
        procession, If it be done in devotion. </p>
      <p>Which is as it were the beginning of King Hercules his Book,
        which entreateth of the colours of the Stone, entitled Iris, or
        the Rainbow, in these termes, The procession of the work: is
        very pleasant unto Nature: the which I have put there expressly
        for the great Clerks who shall understand the Allusion. In this
        same fashion, I say, I put myself upon my way; and so much I did
        that I arrived at Montjoy, and afterwards at St. James, where
        with great devotion I accomplished my vow. This done, in Leon,
        at my return, I met with a Merchant of Bologn, who made me known
        to a Physician, a Jew by Nation, and as then a Christian,
        dwelling in Leon aforesaid, who was very skilful in sublime
        Sciences, called Master Canches. As soon as I had shown him the
        figures of my Extract, he being ravished with great astonishment
        and joy, demanded of me incontinently if I could tell him any
        news of the Book from whence they were drawn! I answered him in
        Latin, (wherein he asked me the question) that I hoped to have
        some good news of the Book, if anybody could decipher unto me
        the Enigmas. All at that instant transported with great Ardor
        and joy, he began to decipher unto me the beginning. But to be
        short, he well content to learn news where this Book should be,
        and I to hear him speak; and certainly he had heard much
        discourse of the Book, but, (as he said) as of a thing which was
        believed to be utterly lost, we resolved of our voyage, and from
        Leon we passed to Oviedo, and from thence to Sansom, where we
        put ourselves to Sea to come into France. Our voyage had been
        fortunate enough, and all-ready since we were entered into this
        Kingdom he had most truly interpreted unto me the greatest part
        of my figures, where even unto the very points and pricks he
        found great mysteries, which seemed unto me wonderful; when
        arriving at Orleans, this learned man fell extremely sick, being
        afflicted with excessive vomitings, which remained still with
        him of those he had suffered at Sea, and he was in such a
        continual fear of my forsaking him that he could imagine nothing
        like unto it. And although I was always by his side, yet would
        he incessantly call for me; but, in sum, he died at the end of
        the seventh day of his sickness, by reason whereof I was much
        grieved; yet, as well as I could, I caused him to be buried in
        the Church of the Holy Cross at Orleans, where he yet resteth:
        God have his soul, for he died a good Christian. And surely, if
        I be not hindered by death, I will give unto that Church some
        revenue, to cause some Masses to be said for his soul every day.
        He that would see the manner of my arrival and the joy of
        Perrenella, let him look upon us two, in this City of Paris,
        upon the door of the Chapel of St. James of the Bouchery, close
        by the one side of my house, where we are both painted, myself
        giving thanks at the feet of St. James of Gallicia, and
        Perrenella at the feet of St. John, whom she had so often called
        upon. So it was that by the grace of God, and the intercession
        of the happy and holy Virgin, and the blessed Saints James and
        John, I knew all that I desired, that is to say, The first
        Principles, yet not their first preparation, which is a thing
        most difficult above all the things in the world. But in the end
        I had that also, after long errors of three years, or
        thereabouts; during which time I did nothing but study and
        labour, so as you may see me without this o4rch, where I have
        placed my Processions against the two Pillars of it, under the
        feet of St. James and St. John, praying always to God, with my
        Beads in my hand, reading attentively within a Book, and poysing
        the words of the Philosophers: and afterwards trying and proving
        the divers operations, which I imagined to myself by their only
        words. finally, I found that which I desired, which I also soon
        knew by the strong scent and odour thereof. Having this, I
        easily accomplished the Mastery, for, knowing the preparation of
        the first Agents, and after following my Book according to the
        letter, I could not have missed it, though I would. Then, the
        first time that I made projection was upon Mercury, whereof I
        turned half-a-pound, or thereabouts, into pure Silver, better
        than that of the Mine, as I myself assayed, and made others
        assay many times. This was upon a Monday, the 17th of January,
        about noon, in my house, Perrenella only being present, in the
        year of the restoring of mankind, 1382. And afterwards,
        following always my Book, from word to word, I made projection
        of the Red Stone upon the like quantity of Mercury, in the
        presence likewise of Perrenella only, in the same house, the
        five and twentieth day of April following, the same year, about
        five o'clock in the evening; which I transmuted truly into
        almost as much pure Cold, better assuredly than common Gold,
        more soft and more plyable. I may speak it with truth, I have
        made it three times, with the help of Perrenella, who understood
        it as well as I, because she helped in my operations, and
        without doubt, if she would have enterprised to have done it
        alone, she had attained to the end and perfection thereof. I had
        indeed enough when I had once done it, but I found exceeding
        great pleasure and delight in seeing and contemplating the
        Admirable works of Nature within the Vessels. To signify unto
        thee, then, how I have done it three times, thou shalt see in
        this Arch, if thou have any skill to know them, three furnaces,
        like unto them which serve for our operations, I was afraid a
        long time, that Perrenella could not hide the extreme joy of her
        felicity, which I measured by mine own, and lest she should let
        fall some word amongst her kindred of the great treasures which
        we possessed: for extreme joy takes away the understanding, as
        well as great heaviness; but the goodness of the most great God
        had not only filled me with this blessing, to give me a wife
        chaste and sage, for she was moreover, not only capable of
        reason, but also to do all that was reasonable, and more
        discrete and secret than ordinarily other women are. Above all,
        she was exceeding devout, and therefore, seeing herself without
        hope of children, and now well stricken in years, she began as I
        did, to think of God, and to give ourselves to the works of
        Mercy. At that time when I wrote this Commentary, in the year
        one thousand four hundred and thirteen, in the end of the year,
        after the decease of my faithful companion, which I shall lament
        all the days of my life; she and I had already founded, and
        endued with revenues, 14 Hospitals in this City of Paris, we had
        now built from the ground three Chapels, we had enriched with
        great gifts and good rents, seven Churches, with many
        reparations in their Churchyards, besides that which we have
        done at Bologne, which is not much less than that which we have
        done here. I will not speak of the good which both of us have
        done to particular poor folks, principally to widows and poor
        orphans, whose names if I should tell, and how I did it, besides
        that my reward should be given me in this World, </p>
      <p>I should likewise do displeasure to those good persons, whom I
        pray God bless, which I would not do for anything in the World.
        Building, therefore, these Churches, Church-yards and Hospitals,
        in this City, I resolved myself, to cause to be painted in the
        fourth Arch of the Church-yard of the Innocents, as you enter in
        by the great gate in St. Dennis-street, and taking the way on
        the right hand, the most true and essential marks of the Art,
        yet under veils, and Hieroglyphical covertures, in imitation of
        those which are in the guilded Book of Abraham the Jew, which
        may represent two things, according to the capacity and
        understanding of them that behold them: First, the mysteries of
        our future and undoubted Resurrection, at the day of Judgment,
        and coming of good Jesus (whom may it please to have mercy upon
        us), a History which is well agreeing to a Church-yard. And,
        secondly, they may signify to them, who are skilled in Natural
        Philosophy, all the principal and necessary operations of the
        Mastery. These Hieroglyphic figures shall serve as two ways to
        lead unto the heavenly life: the first and most open sense
        teaching the sacred Mysteries of our salvation; (as I will show
        hereafter) the other teaching every man that hath any small
        understanding in the Stone the lineary way of the work; which
        being perfected by any one, the change of evil into good takes
        away from him the root of all sin, (which is covetousness)
        making him liberal, gentle, pious, religious, and fearing God,
        how evil soever he was before, for from thenceforward he is
        continually ravished with the great grace and mercy which he
        hath obtained from God, and with the profoundness of his Divine
        and admirable works. These are the reasons which have moved me
        to set these forms in this fashion, and in this place, which is
        a Church-yard, to the end that if any man obtain this
        inestimable good, to conquer this rich golden Fleece, he may
        think with himself (as I did) not to keep the talent of God
        digged in the Earth, buying Lands and possessions, which are the
        vanities of this world: but rather to work charitably towards
        his brethren, remembering himself that he learned this secret
        amongst the bones of the dead, in whose number he shall shortly
        be found; and that after this life he must render an account
        before a just and redoubtable Judge, who will censure even to an
        idle and vain word. Let him, therefore, who having well weighed
        my words, and well known and understood my figures, hath first
        gotten elsewhere the knowledge of the first beginnings and
        Agents, (for certainly in these Figures and Commentaries he
        shall not find any step or information thereof), perfect, to the
        glory of God, the Mastery of Hermes, remembering himself of the
        Church Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman; and of all other
        Churches, Church-yards, and Hospitals; and above all of the
        Church of the Innocents in this City, (in the Church-yard
        whereof he shall have contemplated these true demonstrations);
        opening bounteously his purse to them that are secretly poor
        honest people, desolate, weak women, widows, and forlorn
        orphans. So be it. </p>

        <p><b>Of the Theological Interpretations, which may be given to
            these Hieroglyphics, according to the Sense of me the
            Author.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I have given to this Churchyard, a Charnel-house, which is
        right over against this fourth Arch, in the middest of the
        Churchyard, and against one of the Pillars of this Charnel
        house, I have made be drawn with a coal, and grossly painted, a
        man all black, which looks straight upon these Hieroglyphics,
        about whom there is written in French: It voy merveile done
        moult Ie m'esbahi; that is, I see a marvel, whereat I am much
        amazed: This, as also three plates of Iron and Copper gilt, on
        the East, West, and South of the Arch, where these Hieroglyphics
        are, in the middest of the Churchyard representing the holy
        Passion and Resurrection of the Son of God this ought not to be
        otherwise interpreted, than according to the common Theological
        sense, saving that this black man, may as well proclaim it a
        wonder of God in the transmutation of Metals, which is figured
        in these Hieroglyphics, which he so attentively looks upon, as
        to see buried so many bodies, which shall rise again out of
        their Tombs at the fearful day of judgement. On the other part I
        do not think it needful to interpret in a Theological sense that
        vessel of Earth on the right hand of these figures, within the
        which there is a Pen and Inkhorn, or rather vessel of
        Phylosophy, if thou take away the strings, and join the Pen to
        the Inkhorne: nor the other two like it, which are on the two
        sides of the figures of Saint Peter, and Saint Paul, within one
        of the which, there is an N. which signifieth Nicholas, and
        within the other an F. which signifieth Flammel. For these
        vessels signify nothing else, but that in the like of them, I
        have done the Maistery three times. Moreover, he that will also
        believe that I have put these vessels in form of Scutchions to
        represent this Pen and Inkhorn, and the capital letters of my
        name, let him believe it if he will, because both these
        interpretations are true. </p>
      <p>Neither must you interpret in a Theological sense that writing
        which followeth, in these terms, NICHOLAS FLAMEL ET PERRENELLE
        SA FEMME, that is, Nicholas Flammel, and Perrenelle his wife, in
        as much as that signifieth nothing, but that I and my wife have
        given that Arch. </p>
      <p>As to the third, fourth, and fifth Tables following, by the
        sides whereof is written, COMMENT LES INNOCENTS FVRENTOCCIS PAR
        LE COMMANDEMENT DV ROY HERODES, that is How the Innocents were
        killed by the commandment of King Herod. The theological sense
        is well enough understood by the writing, we must only speak of
        the rest, which is above. </p>
      <p>The two Dragons united together to one within the other, of
        colour black and blue, in a field sable, that is to say, black,
        whereof the one hath the wings gilded, and the other hath none
        at all, are the sins which naturally are enserchayned, for the
        one hath his original and birth from another: Of them some may
        be easily chased away, as they come easily, for they fly towards
        us every hour; and those which have no wings can never be chased
        away, such as is the sin against the holy Ghost. The Gold which
        is in the wings signifieth that the greatest part of sins
        commeth from the unholy hunger after gold; which makes so many
        people diligently to harken from whence they may have it: and
        the colour black and blue showeth that these are the desires
        that come out of the dark pits of hell, which we ought wholly to
        fly from. These two Dragons may also morely represent unto us
        the Legions of evil spirits which are always about us, and which
        will accuse us, before the just judge, at the fearful day of
        Judgement, which do ask nor seek nothing else but to sist us. </p>
      <p>The man and the woman which are next them, of an orange colour,
        upon a field azure and blue, signify that men and women ought
        not to have their hope in this World, for the orange colour
        intimates dispair, or the letting go of hope, as here; and the
        colour azure and blue, upon they are painted, shows us that we
        must think of heavenly things to come, and say as the roule of
        the man doth, HOMO VENIET ADIVICIVM DEI, that is, Man must come
        to the judgement of God may show mercy unto us. </p>
      <p>Next after this in a field of Syneple, that is green, are
        painted two men and one woman rising again, of the which one
        comes out of a Sepulchre, the other two out of the Earth, all
        three of colour exceeding white and pure, lifting their hands
        towards their eyes, and their eyes towards Heaven on high: Above
        these three bodies there are two Angels sounding musical
        Instruments; as if they had called these dead to the day of
        Judgement; for over these two Angels is the figure of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, holding the world in his hand, upon whose head an
        Angel setteth a Crown, assisted by two others, which say in
        their roules, O pater Omnipotens, o'jesu bone, that is, O Father
        Almighty, O'good Jesu. On the right side of this Saviour is
        painted St. Paul, clothed with white &amp; yellow, with a Sword,
        at whose feet there is a man clothed in a gown of orange colour,
        in which there appeared pleats or folds of black and white,
        (which picture resembleth me to the life) and demandeth pardon
        of his sins, holding his hands joined together, from between
        which proceed these words written in a roule, DE LE MALA QVE
        FECI, that is to say, Blot out the evils that I have done. </p>
      <p>On the other side on the left hand, is Saint Peter with his
        Key, clothed in reddish yellow, holding his hand upon a woman
        clad in a gown of orange colour, which is on her knees,
        representing to the life Perrenelle, which holdeth her hands
        joined together, having a roule where is written, CHRISTE PRECOR
        ESTO PIVS, that is, Christ I beseech thee be pitiful: Behind
        whom there is an Angel on his knees, with a roule, that saith,
        SALVE DOMINE ANGELORVM, that is, All hail thou Lord of Angels.
        There is also another Angel on his knees, behind my Image, on
        the same side that St. Paul is on, which likewise holdeth a
        roule, saying, O REX SEMPITERNE, that is, O King everlasting.
        All this is so clear, according to the explication of the
        Resurrection and future judgement, that it may easily be fitted
        thereto. So it seems this Arch was not painted for any other
        purpose, but to represent this. And therefore we need not stay
        any longer upon it, considering that the least and most
        ignorant, may well know how to give this interpretation. </p>
      <p>Next after the three that are rising again, come two Angels
        more of an Orange colour upon a blue field, saying in the
        roules, SVRGITE MORTVIVENITE AD IVDICIVM DOMINI MEI, that is,
        Arise you dead, come to the Judgement of my Lord. This also
        serves to the interpretation of the Resurrection: As also the
        last Figures following, which are, A man red vermillion, upon a
        field of Violet colour, who holdeth the foot of a winged Lion,
        painted of red vermillion also, opening his throat, as it were
        to devour the man : For one may say that this is the Figure of
        an unhappy sinner, who sleeping in a Lethargy of his corruption
        and vices, dieth without repentance and confession; who without
        doubt in this terrible Day shall be delivered to the Devil, here
        painted in form of a red roaring Lion, which will swallow and
        devour him. </p>

        <p><b>The Interpretations Philosophical, according to the
            Maistery of Hermes.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I desire with all my heart that he who searcheth the secrets of
        the Sages, having in his Spirit passed over these Ideas of the
        life and resurrection to come, should first make his profit of
        them : And in the second place, that he be more advised than
        before, that he sound and search the depth of my Figures,
        colours, and rowles; principally of my rowles, because that in
        this Art they speak not vulgarly. Afterward let him ask of
        himself why the Figure of Saint Paul is on the right hand, in
        the place where the custom is to paint S. Peter? And on the
        other side that of Saint Peter, in the place of the figure of
        Saint Paul? Why the Figure of Saint Paul is clothed in colours
        white and yellow, and that of S. Peter in yellow and red? </p>
      <p>Why also the man and the woman which are at the feet of these
        two Saints praying to God, as if it were at the Day of
        Judgement, are apparelled in divers colours and not naked, or
        else nothing but bones, like them that are rising again? Why in
        this Day of Judgement they have painted this man and this woman
        at the feet of the Saints? For they ought to have been more low
        on earth, and not in heaven. </p>
      <p>Why also the two Angels in Orange colour, which say in their
        rowles, SVRGITE MORTVI, VENITE AD IVDICIVM DOMINI MEI, that is
        Arise you dead, come unto the Judgement of my Lord, are clad in
        this colour, and out of their place, for they ought to be on
        high in heaven, with the two other which play upon the
        Instruments? Why they have a field Violet and blue? But
        principally why their roule, which speaks to the dead, ends in
        the open throat of the red and flying Lion? </p>
      <p>I would then that after these, and many other questions which
        may justly be made, opening wide the eyes of his spirit, he come
        to conclude, that all this, not having been done without cause,
        there must be represented under this bark, some great secrets,
        which he ought to pray God to discover unto him. Having then
        brought his belief by degrees to this pass wish also that he
        would further believe, that these figures and explications are
        not made for them that have never seen the Books of the
        Philosophers, and who not knowing the Metallic principles,
        cannot be named Children of this Science; for if they think to
        understand perfectly these figures, being ignorant of the first
        Agent, they will undoubtedly deceive themselves, and never be
        able to know any thing at all. </p>
      <p>Let no man therefore blame me, if he do not easily understand
        me, for he will be more blame-worthy than I, inasmuch as not
        being initiated into these sacred and secret interpretations of
        the first Agent, (which is the key opening the gates of all
        Sciences) he would notwithstanding, comprehend the most subtile
        conceptions of the envious Philosophers, which are not written
        but for them who already know these principles, which are never
        found in any book, because they leave them unto God, who
        revealeth them to whom he please, or else causeth them to be
        taught by the living voice of a Maister, by Cabalistical
        tradition, which happeneth very seldom. </p>
      <p>Now then, my Son, let me so call thee, both because I am now
        come to a great age, and also for that, it may be, thou art
        otherwise a child of this knowledge, (God enable thee to learn,
        and after to work to his glory). Hearken unto me then
        attentively, but pass no further if thou be ignorant of the
        foresaid Principles. </p>

      </center>
      <p>This Vessel of earth, in this form, is called by the
        Philosophers, their triple Vessel, for within it there is in the
        middest a Stage, or a floor, and upon that a dish or a platter
        full of lukewarm ashes, within which is set the Philosophical
        Egg, that is, a vial of glass full of confections of Art (as of
        the feumme of the red sea, and the fat of the mercurial wind)
        which thou see painted in form of a Penner and Inkehorn. Now
        this Vessel of earth is open above to put in the dish and the
        vial, under which by the open gate, is put in the Philosophical
        fire, as thou knowest. So thou hast three vessels; and the
        threefold vessel: The envious have called an Athanor, a fiue,
        dung, Balneum Marie, a Furnace, a Sphere, the greene Lion, a
        prison, a grave, a urinal, a phioll, and a Bolts-head : I myself
        in my Summary or Abridgement of Philosophy, which I composed
        four years and two months past, in the end thereof named it the
        house and habitation of the Poulet, and the ashes of the
        Platter, the chaffe of the Poulet; </p>
      <p>The common name is an Oven, which I should never have found, if
        Abraham the Jew had not painted it, together with the fire
        proportionable, wherein consists a great part of the secret. For
        it is as it were the belly, or the womb, containing the true
        natural heat to animate our young King : If this fire be not
        measured Clibanically, saith Calid the Persian, son of Iasichus;
        If it be kindled with a sword, saith Pithagoras; If thou fire
        thy Vessel, saith Morien, and maketh it feel the heat of the
        fire, it will give thee a box on the care, and burn his flowers
        before they be risen from the depth of his Marrow, making them
        come out red, rather than white, and then thy work is spoiled ;
        as also if thou make too little fire, for then thou shalt never
        see the end, because of the coldness of the natures, which shall
        not have had motion sufficient to digest them together. </p>
      <p>The heat then of thy fire in this vessel, shall be (as saith
        Hermes and Rofinus) according to the Winter; or rather, as saith
        Diomedes, according to the heat of a Bird, which begins to fly
        so softly from the sign of Aries to that of Cancer : for know
        that the Infant at the beginning is full of cold phlegm and of
        milk, and that too vehement heat is an enemy of the cold and
        moisture of our Embrion, and that the two enemies, that is to
        say, our two elements of cold and heat will never perfectly
        embrace one another, but by little and little, having first long
        dwelt together, in the middest of the temperate heat of their
        bath, and being changed by long decoction, into Sulphur
        incombustible. </p>
      <p>Govern therefore sweetly with equality and proportion, thy
        proud and haughty natures, for fear lest if thou favour one more
        than another, they which naturally are enemies, do grow angry
        against thee through jealousy, and dry Choller, and make thee
        sigh for it a long time after. Besides this, thou must entertain
        them in this temperate heat perpetually, that is to say, night
        and day until the time that Winter, the time of the moisture of
        the matters, be passed; because they make their peace, and join
        hands in being heated together, whereas should these natures
        find themselves but one only half hour without fire, they would
        become for ever irreconcilable. </p>
      <p>See therefore the reason why it is said in the Book of the
        seventy precepts: Look that their heat continue indefatigably
        without ceasing, and that none of their days be forgotten. And
        Rafis, the haste, saith he, that brings with it too much fire,
        is always followed by the Diuell, and Error. When the golden
        Bird, saith Diomedes, shall become just to Cancer, and that from
        thence it shall run toward Libra, then thou mayst augment the
        fire a little. And in like manner, when this faire Bird, shall
        fly from Libra towards Capricorn, which is the desired Autumn,
        the time of harvest, and of the fruits that are now ripe. </p>

        undermost, without wings, he is the fixed, or the male; that
        which is uppermost, is the volatile, or the female, black and
        obscure, which goes about to get the domination for many months.
        The first is called Sulphur, or heat and dryness, and the latter
        Argent vive, or cold and moisture. These are the Sun and Moon of
        the Mercurial source, and sulphurous original, which by
        continual fire are adorned with royal habiliments, that being
        united, and afterward changed into a quintessence, they may
        overcome every thing Metallic, how solid hard and strong, soever
        it be. </p>
      <p>These are the Serpents and Dragons which the ancient AEgyptians
        have painted in a Circle, the head biting the tail, to signify
        that they proceeded from one and the same thing, and that it
        alone was sufficient, and that in the turning and circulation
        thereof, it made it self perfect : These are the Dragons which
        the ancient Poets have fained did without sleeping keep &amp;
        watch the golden Apples of the Gardens of the Virgins
        Hesperides. These are they upon whom Jason in his adventure for
        the Golden Fleece, powred the broth or liquor prepared by the
        fair Medea, of the discourse of whom the Books of the
        Philosophers are so full, that there is no philosopher that ever
        was, but he hath written of it, from the time of the
        truth-telling hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Morienus, and the
        other following, even unto myself. </p>
      <p>These are the two Serpents, given and sent by Juno, (that is,
        the nature Metallic) the which the strong Hercules, that is to
        say, the sage and wise man must strangle in his cradle, that is,
        overcome and kill them, to make them putrify, corrupt, and
        ingender, at the beginning of his work. These are the two
        Serpents, wrapped and twisted round about the Caduceus or rod of
        Mercury, with the which he exerciseth his great power, and
        transformeth himself as he lifteth. He, saith Haly, that shall
        kill the one, shall also kill the other, because the one cannot
        die, but with his brother. </p>
      <p>These two then, (which Auicen calleth the Corassene bitch and
        the Armenian dog) these two I say, being put together in the
        vessel of the Sepulcher, do bite one another cruelly, and by
        their great poison, and furious rage, they never leave one
        another, from the moment that they have seized on one another
        (if the cold hinder them not) till both of them by their
        slavering venom, and mortal hurts, all of a goare bloud, over
        all the parts of their bodies; and finally, killing one another,
        be stewed in their proper venom, which after their death,
        changeth them into living and permanent water; before which
        time, they loose in their corruption and putrifaction, their
        first natural forms, to take afterwards one only new, more
        noble, and better form. These are the two Spermes, masculine and
        feminine, described at the beginning of my Abridgment of
        Philosophy, which are engendred (say Rafis, Auicen, and Abraham
        the Jew) within the Reynes, and entrails, and of the operations
        of the four Elements. </p>
      <p>These are the radical moisture of metals, Sulphur and Argent
        Vive not vulgar, and such as are sold by the Merchants and
        Apothecaries, but those which give us those two fair and dear
        bodies which we love so much. These two spermes, saith
        Democritus, are not found upon the earth of the living: The
        same, saith Auicen, but he addeth, that they gather them from
        the dung, ordure, and rotteness of the Sun and Moon. O happy are
        they that know how to gather them; for of them they afterwards
        make a triacle, which hath power over all griefs, maladies,
        sorrows, infirmities, and weaknesses, and which fighteth
        puissantly against death, lengthening the life, according to the
        permission of God, even to the time determined, triumphing over
        the miseries of this world, and filling a man with the riches
        thereof. </p>
      <p>Of these two Dragons or Principles Metallic, I have said in my
        fore-alledged Summary, that the Enemy would by his heat inflame
        his enemy, and that then if they take not heed, they should see
        in the air a venomous fume and a stinking, work in flame, and in
        poison, than the envenomed head of a Serpent, and Babylonian
        Dragon. The cause why I have painted these two spermes in the
        form of Dragons, is because their stench is exceeding great, and
        like the stench of them, and the exhalations which arise within
        the glass, are dark, black, blue, and yellowish (like as these
        two Dragons are painted) the force of which, and of the bodies
        dissolved, is so venomous, that truly there is not in the world
        a ranker poison; for it is able by the force and stench thereof,
        to mortify and kill everything living. The Philosopher never
        feels this stench, if he break not his vessels, but only he
        judgeth it to be such, by the sight, and the changing of
        colours, proceeding from the rottenness of his confections. </p>
      <p>These colours then signify the putrifaction and generation
        which is given us, by the biting and dissolution of our perfect
        bodies, which dissolution proceedeth from external heat adding,
        and from the Pontique fierieness, and admirable sharp vertue of
        the poison of our Mercury, which maketh and resolveth into a
        pure cloud, that is, into impalpable powder, all that which it
        finds to resist it. So the heat working upon and against the
        radical, metallic, viscous, or oily moisture, ingendereth upon
        the subject, blackness. For at the same time the Matter is
        dissolved, is corrupted, groweth black, and conceiveth to
        ingender; for all corruption is generation, and therefore ought
        blackness to be much disired; for that is the black sail with
        the which the Ship of Theseus came back victorious from Crete,
        which was the cause of the death of his Father; so must this
        father die, to the intent, that from the ashes of this Phoenix
        another may spring, and that the son may be King. </p>
      <p>Assuredly he that seeth not this blackness at the beginning of
        his operations, during the days of the Stone; what other colour
        soever he see, he shall altogether fail in the Maistery, and can
        do no more with that Chaos: for he works not well, if he putrify
        not; because if he do not putrify, he doeth not corrupt, nor
        ingender, and by consequence, the Stone cannot take vegetative
        life to increase and multiply. </p>
      <p>And in all truth, I tell thee again, that though thou work upon
        the true matter, if at the beginning, after thou hast put they
        Confections in the Philosophers Egg, that is to say, sometime
        after the fire have stirred them up, if then, I say, thou seest
        not this head of the Crow, the black of the blackest black, thou
        must begin again, for this fault is irreparable, and not to be
        amended; especially the Orange colour, or half red, is to be
        feared, for if at the beginning thou see that in thine Egg,
        without doubt, thou burnest, or hast burnt the verdure and
        jueliness of thy Stone. </p>
      <p>The colour which thou must have, ought to be intirely perfected
        in Blackness, like to that of these Dragons in the space of
        forty days: Let them therefore which shall not have these
        essential marks, retire themselves betimes from their
        operations, that they may redeem themselves from assured loss.
        Know also, and note it well, that in this Art it is but nothing
        to have this blackness, there is nothing more easy to come by:
        for from almost all things in the world, mixed with moisture,
        thou mayest have a blackness by the fire: but thou must have a
        blackness which comes from the perfect Metallic bodies, which
        lasts a long space of time, and is not destroyed in less than
        five months, after the which followeth immediately the desired
        whiteness. If thou hast this, thou hast enough, but not all. As
        for the colour blueish and yellowish, that signifieth that
        Solution and Putrefaction is not yet finished, and that the
        colours of our Mercury are not as yet well mingled, and rotten
        with the rest. Then this blackness, and these colours, teach
        plainly, that in this beginning the matter, and compound begins
        to rot and dissolve into powder, less than the Atoms of the Sun,
        the which afterwards are changed into coator permanent. </p>
      <p>And this dissolution is by the envious Philosophers called
        Death, Destruction, and Perdition, because that the natures
        change their form, and from hence are proceeded so many
        Allegories of dead men, tombs and sepulchres. Others have called
        it Calcinatin, Denudation, Separation, Erituration, and
        Assation, because the Confections are changed and reduced into
        most small pieces and parts. Others have called it Reduction
        into the first matter, Mollification, Extraction, Commixtion,
        Liquefaction, Conversion of Elements, Subtiliation, Division,
        Humation, Impastation, and Distiliation, because that the
        Confections are melted, brought back into seed, softened, and
        circulated within the glass. </p>
      <p>Others have called it Xir, or Iris, Putrefaction , Corruption,
        Cymmerian darkness, a gulf, Hell, Dragons, Generation,
        Ingression, Submersion, Completion, Conjunction, and
        Impregnation, because that the matter is black and waterish, and
        that the natures are prefectly mingled, and hold one of another.
        For when the heat of the Sun worketh upon them, they are
        changed, first into powder, or fat and glutinous water, which
        feeling the heat, flyeth on high to the poulets head, with the
        smoke, that is to say, with the wind and air; for thence this
        water melted, and drawn out of the confections, goeth down
        again, and in descending reduceth, and resolveth, as much as it
        can, the rest of the Aromatical confections, always doing so,
        until the whole be like a black broth somewhat fat. Now you see
        why they call this sublimation and volatization, because it
        flyeth on high, and Ascension and Descension, because it
        mounteth and descendeth within the glass. </p>
      <p>A while after, the water beginneth to thicken and coagulate
        somewhat more, growing very black, like unto pitch, and finally
        comes the body and earth, which the envious have called Terra
        Foetida, that is, stinking earth: for then because of the
        perfect putrefaction, which is as natural as any other can be,
        this earth stinks, and gives a smell like the odour of graves
        filled with rottenness, and with bodies as yet charged with
        their natural moisture. This earth was by Hermes called Terra
        foliata, or the Earth of leaves, yet his true and proper name is
        Leton, which must afterward be whitened. The Ancient Sages that
        were Cabalists, have described it in their Metamorphoses, under
        the History of the Serpent of Mars, which had devoured the
        companions of Cadmus, who slew him, piercing him with his lance
        against a hollow Oak. Note this Oak. </p>

      <p>The man painted here doth expressly resemble myself to the
        natural, as the woman doth lively figure Perrenelle. The cause
        why we are painted to the life, is not particular to this
        purpose for it needed but to represent a male and a female, to
        the which our two particular resemblance was not necessarily
        required, but it pleased the Painter to put us there, just as he
        hath done higher in this Arch, at the feet of the Figure of
        Saint Paul and Saint Peter, according to that we were in our
        youth; as he hath likewise done in other places, as over the
        door of the Chapel of Saint James in the Bouchery near to my
        house (although that for this last there is a particular cause)
        as also over the door of Saincte Geneviesue des Ardans, where
        thou mayst see me. I made then to be painted here two bodies,
        one of a Male, and another of a Female, to teach thee that in
        this second operation, thou hast truely, but yet not perfectly,
        two natures conjoined and married together, the Masculine and
        the Feminine, or rather the four Elements; and that the four
        natural enemies, the hot and cold, dry and moist, begin to
        approach amiably one towards another, and by means of the
        Mediators and Peace-makers, lay down by little and little, the
        ancient enmity of the old Chaos. </p>
      <p>Thou knowest well enough who these Mediators and Peace-makers
        are, between the hot and the cold there is moisture, for he is
        kinsman and allied to them both; to hot by his heat, and to cold
        by his moisture: And this is the reason, why to begin to make
        this peace, thou hast already in the precedent operation,
        converted all the confections into water by dissolution. And
        afterward thou hast made to coagulate the water, which is turned
        into this Earth, black of the black most black, wholly to
        accomplish this peace; for the Earth, which is cold and dry,
        finding himself of kindred and alliance with the dry and moist,
        which are enemies, will wholly appease and accord them. </p>
      <p>Doest thou not then consider a most perfect mixture of all the
        four Elements, having first turned them to water, and now into
        Earth? I will also teach thee hereafter the other conversions,
        into air when it shall be all white, and into fire, when it
        shall be of a most perfect purple. Then thou hast here two
        natures married together, whereof the one hath conceived by the
        other, and by this conception it is turned into the body of the
        Male, and the Male into that of the Female; that is to say, they
        are made one only body, which is the Androgyne or hermaphrodite
        of the Ancients, which they have also called otherwise the head
        of the Crow, or natures converted. </p>
      <p>In this fashion I paint them here, because thou hast two
        natures reconciled, which (if they be guided and governed
        wisely) can form an Embrion in the womb of the Vessel, and
        afterwards bring forth a most puissant King, invincible and
        incorruptible, because it will be an admirable quintessence.
        Thus thou seest the principal and most necessary reason of this
        representation: The second cause, which is also well to be
        noted, was because I must of necessity paint two bodies, because
        in this operation it behoveth that thou divide that which hath
        been coagulated, to give afterwards nourishment, which is milk
        of life, to the little Infant when it is born, which is endued,
        by the living God, with a vegetable soul. </p>
      <p>This is a secret most admirable and secret, which for want of
        understanding, it hath made fools of all those that have sought
        it without finding it, and hath made every man wise that beholds
        it with the eyes of his body, or of his spirit. </p>
      <p>Thou must then make two parts and portions of this Coagulated
        body, the one of which shall serve for Azoth, to wash and
        cleanse the other, which is called Letch, which must be
        whitened: He which is washed is the Serpent Python, which,
        having taken his being from the corruption of the slime of the
        Earth gathered together by the waters of the deluge, when all
        the confections were water, must be killed and overcome by the
        arrows of the God Apollo, by the yellow Sun, that is to say, by
        our fire, equal to that of the Sun. </p>
      <p>He which washeth, or rather the washings which must be
        continued with the other moity; these are the teeth of that
        Serpent, which the sage workman, the valiant Theseus, will sow
        in the same Earth, from whence there shall spring up armed
        Soldiers, which shall in the end discomfit themselves, suffering
        themselves by opposition to resolve into the same nature of the
        Earth, and the workman to bear away his deserved conquests. </p>
      <p>It is of this that the Philosophers have written so often, and
        so often repeated it. It dissolves itself, it congeals itself,
        it makes itself black, it makes itself white, it kills itself,
        and it quickens itself. I have made their field be painted azure
        and blue, to show that I do but now begin to get out from the
        most black blackness, for the azure and blue is one of the first
        colours, that the dark woman lets us see, that is to say,
        moisture giving place a little to heat and dryness: The man and
        woman are almost all orange-coloured, to show that our Bodies,
        or our body which the wise men here call Rebis, hath not as yet
        digestion enough and that the moisture from whence comes the
        black blue and azure, is but half vanquished by the dryness. </p>
      <p>For when dryness bears rule, all will be white, and when it
        fighteth with, or is equal to the moisture, all will be in part
        according to these present colours. The envious have also called
        these confections in this operation, Nummus, Ethelia, Arena,
        Boritis, Corfufle, Cambar, Albar aris, Duenech, Randeric, Kukul,
        Thabricis, Ebisemech, Ixir, &amp;c which they have commanded to
        make white. </p>
      <p>The woman hath a white circle in form of a rowle round about
        her body, to show thee that Rebis will begin to become white in
        that very fashion, beginning first at the extremities, round
        about this white circle. <i>Scala Phylosophoru</i>, that is the
        Book entitled <i>The Philosophers Ladder</i>, saith thus: The
        figure of the first perfect whiteness is the manifestation of a
        certain little circle of hair, that is passing over the head,
        which will appear on the sides of the vessels round about the
        matter, in a kind of a cierine or yellowish colour. </p>
      <p>There is written in their Rowles, Home veniet ad judicium Dei,
        that is, Man shall come to the judgement of God : Vere (saith
        the woman) illa dies terribilis erit, that is, Truly that will
        be a terrible day. These are not passages of holy Scripture, but
        only sayings which speak according to the Theological sense, of
        the judgement to come. I have put them there to serve myself of
        them towards him, that beholds only the gross outward and most
        natural Artifice, taking the interpretation thereof to concern
        only the Resurrection, and also it may serve for them that
        gathering together the Parables of the Science, take to them the
        eyes of Lynceus, to pierce deeper then the visible objects.
        There is then, Man shall come to the judgement of God: Certainly
        that day shall be terrible. That is as if I should have said; It
        behoves that this come to the colour of perfection, to be judged
        and cleansed from all his blackness and filth, and to be
        spiritualized and whitened. Surely that day will be terrible,
        yet certainly, as you shall find in the Allegory of Aristeau,
        Horror holds us in prison by the space of four-score days, in
        the darkness of the waters, in the extreme heat of the Summer,
        and in the troubles of the Sea. All which things ought first to
        pass before our King can become white, coming from death to
        life, to overcome afterwards all his enemies. </p>
      <p>To make thee understand yet somewhat better this Albification,
        which is harder and more difficult than all the rest, for till
        that time thou mayest err at every step, but afterwards thou
        canst not, except thou break thy vessels, I have also made for
        thee this Table following. </p>

      <p>Mark well this man in the form of Saint Paul, clothed in a robe
        entirely of a yellowish white. If thou consider him well, he
        turns his body in such a posture, as shows that he would take
        the naked Sword, either to cut off the head, or to do some other
        thing, to that man which is on his knees at his feet, clothed in
        a robe of orange colour, white and black, which saith in his
        roule, DE LE MALA QVAE FECI, that is, Blot out all the evil
        which I have done, as if he should say, TOLLE NIGREDINEM, Take
        away from me my blackness; A term of Art: for Evil signifieth in
        the Allegory blackness, as it is often found in Turba
        Phylosophorum: Seeth it until it come to blackness, which will
        be thought Evil. But wouldest thou know what is meant by this
        man, that taketh the Sword? It signifies that thou must cut off
        the head of the Crow, that is to say, of the man clothed in
        divers Colours, which is on his knees. </p>
      <p>I have taken this portrait and figure out of Hermes
        Trismagistus, in his Book of the Secret Art, where he saith,
        Take away the head of this black man, cut off the head of the
        Crow, that is to say, Whiten our black. Lambspring, that noble
        German, hath also used it in the Commentary of his
        Hieroglyphics, saying, In this wood there is a Beast all covered
        with black, if any man cut off his head, he will loose his
        blackness and put on a most white colour. Will you understand
        what that is? The blackness is called the head of the Crow, the
        which being taken away, at the instant comes the white colour:
        Then that is to say, when the Cloud appears no more, this body
        is said to be without a head. </p>
      <p>These are his proper words. In the same sense the Sages have
        also said in other places, Take the Viper which is called De
        rexa, cut off his head, &amp;c. that is to say, take away from
        him his blackness. They have also used this Periphrasis when to
        signify the multiplication of the Stone, they have fained a
        Serpent Hydra, whereof, if one cut off one head, there will
        spring in the place thereof ten; for the stone augments tenfold,
        every time that they cut off this head of the Crow, that they
        make it black, and afterwards white, that is to say, that they
        dissolve it anew, and afterward coagulate it again. </p>
      <p>Mark how this naked Sword is wreathed about with a black
        girdle, and that the ends thereof are not so wreathed at all.
        This naked shining Sword is the stone for the white, or the
        white stone, so often by the Philosophers described under this
        form. To come then to this perfect and sparkling whiteness, thou
        must understand the wreathings of this black girdle, and follow
        that which they teach, which is the quantity of the imbibitions.
        The two ends which are not wreathed about at all, represent the
        beginning and the ending: for the beginning it teacheth that you
        must inbibe it at the first time gently and scarcely, giving it
        then a little milk, as to a little Child newborn, to the intent
        that Ifir, as the Authors say, be not drowned: The like must we
        do at the end, when we see that our King is full, and will have
        no more. The middle of these operations is painted by the five
        whole wreathes, or rounds, of the black girdle, at what time,
        (because our Salamander lives of the fire, and in the middest of
        the fire, and indeed is a fire, and an Argent vive, or
        quicksilver, that runs in the middest of the fire fearing
        nothing), thou must give him abundantly, in such sort that the
        Virgins Milk compass all the matter round about. </p>
      <p>I have made to be painted black all these wreaths or rounds of
        the girdle, because these are the imbibitions, and by
        consequence, blacknesses: for the fire with the moisture (as it
        hath been often said) causeth blackness. And as these five whole
        wreathes or rounds show that you must do this five times wholly,
        so likewise they let you know that you must do this in five
        whole months, a month to every imbibition: See here the reason
        why Haly Abenragel said, the Coction or boiling of the things is
        done in three times fifty days: It is true that if thou count
        these little imbibitions at the beginning and at the end, there
        are seven. Whereupon one of the most envious hath said, Our head
        of the Crow is leprous, and therefore he that would cleanse it,
        he must make it go down seven times into the River of
        regeneration of Jordan, as the Prophet commanded the leprous
        Naaman the Syrian. </p>
      <p>Comprehending herein the beginning, which is but of a few days,
        the middle, and the end, which is also very short. I have then
        given thee this table, to tell thee that thou must whiten my
        body, which is upon the knees, and demandeth no other thing: for
        Nature always tends to perfection, which thou shalt accomplish
        by the apposition of Virgins milk, and by the decoction of the
        matters which thou shalt make with this milk, which being dried
        upon this body, will colour it into this same white yellow,
        which he who takes the Sword, is clothed withall, in which
        colour thou must make they Corfufle to come. The vestments of
        the figure of Saint Paul are bordered largely with a golden and
        red citrine colour. </p>
      <p>Oh my Son, praise God, if ever thou seest this, for now hast
        thou obtained mercy from Heaven; Imbibe it then, and teine it
        till such time as the little Infant be hardy ans strong, to
        combat against the water and the fire: In accomplishing the
        which, thou shalt do that which Demagoras, Senior, and Haly have
        called, The putting of the Mother into the Infants belly, which
        Infant the Mother had but lately brought forth; for they call
        the Mother the Mercury of Philosophers, wherewith they make
        their imbibitions and fermentations, and the Infant they call
        the Body, to teine or colour the which this Mercury is gone out.
        Therefore I have given thee these two figures, to signify the
        Albifications, for in this place it is that thou hast need of
        great help, for here all the World is deceived. </p>
      <p>This operation is indeed a Labyrinth, for here there present
        themselves a thousand ways at the same instant, besides that,
        thou must go to the end of it, directly contrary to the
        beginning, in coagulating that which before thou dissolvedst,
        and in making earth that which before thou madest water. When
        thou hast made it white, then hast thou overcome the enchanted
        Bulls that cast fire and smoke out of their nostrils. Hercules
        hath cleansed the stable full of ordure, of rottenness, and of
        blackness. Jason hath powred the decoction or broth upon the
        Dragons of Colchos, and thou hast in thy power the horn of
        Amalthea which (although it be white) may fill thee all the rest
        of thy life with glory, honour, and riches. To have the which,
        it hath behoved thee to fight valiantly, and in manner of an
        Hercules, for this Achelous, this moist river, is indewed with a
        most mighty force, besides that he often transfigures himself
        from one form to another. Thus hast thou done all, because the
        rest is without difficulty. </p>
      <p>These transfigurations are particularly described in the Book
        of the Seven Egyptian Seals, where it is said (as also by all
        Authors) that the Stone, before it will wholly forsake his
        blackness, and become white in the fashion of a most shining
        marble, and of a naked flaming sword, will put on all the
        colours that thou canst possibly imagine, often will it melt,
        and often coagulate itself, and amidst these divers and contrary
        operations (which the vegetable soul which is in it makes it
        perform at one and the same time) it will grow Citrine, green,
        red (but not of a true red) it will become yellow, blue, and
        orange colour, until that being wholly overcome by dryness and
        heat, all these infinite colours will end in this admirable
        Citrine whiteness, of the colour of Saint Pauls garments, which
        in a short time will become like the colour of the naked sword;
        afterwards by the means of a more strong and long decoction it
        will take in the end a red Citrine colour, and afterward the
        perfect red of the vermillion, where it will repose itself
        forever. </p>
      <p>I will not forget, by the way, to advertise thee, that the milk
        of the Moon, is not as the Virgins milk of the Sun; think then
        that the inbibitions of whiteness, require a more white milk
        than those of a golden redness; for in this passage I had
        thought I should have missed, and so I had done indeed had it
        not been for Abraham the Jew; for this reason I have made to be
        painted for thee the Figure which taketh the naked sword, in the
        colour which is necessary for thee, for it is the Figure of that
        which whiteneth. </p>

      <p>I have so made to be painted for thee a field vert, because
        that in this decoction the confections become green, and keep
        this colour longer than any other after the black. This
        greenness shows particularly that our Stone hath a vegetable
        soul, and that by the Industry of Art it is turned into a true
        and pure tree, to bud abundantly, and afterwards to bring forth
        infinite little sprigs and branches. O happy green (saith the
        Rosary) which doest produce all things, without thee nothing can
        increase, vegetate, nor multiply. The three folk rising again,
        clothed in sparkling white, represent the body, soul, and Spirit
        of our white Stone. </p>
      <p>The philosophers do ordinarily use these terms of Art to hide
        the secret from evil men. They call the Body that black earth,
        obscure and dark, which we make white: They call the Soul the
        other half divided from the Body, which by the will of God, and
        power of nature, gives to the body by his inbibitions and
        fermentations a vegetable soul, that is to say, power and vertue
        to bud, encrease, multiply, and to become white, as a naked
        shining sword: They call the Spirit, the tincture &amp; dryness,
        which as a Spirit hath power to pierce all Metallic things. I
        should be too tedious, if I should show thee how good reason
        they had to say always and in all places, Our Stone hath
        semblably to a man, a Body, Soul, and Spirit. I would only that
        thou note well, that as a man indued with a Body, Soul and
        Spirit, is notwithstanding but one, so likewise thou hast now
        but one only white confection, in the which nevertheless there
        are a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit, which are inseparably united.
      </p>
      <p>I could easily give very clear comparisons and expositions of
        this Body, Soul, and Spirit; but to explicate them, I must of
        necessity speak things which God reserves to reveal unto them
        that fear and love him, and consequently ought not to be
        written. I have then made to be painted here, a Body, a Soul,
        and a Spirit, all white, as if they were rising again, to show
        thee, that the Sun and Moon and Mercury are raised again in this
        operation, that is to say, are made Elements of air, and
        whitened: for we have heretofore called the blackness, Death;
        and so continuing the Metaphor, we may call Whiteness, Life;
        which commeth not, but with, and by a Resurrection. The Body, to
        show this more plainly, I have made to be painted lifting up the
        stone of his tomb, wherein it was inclosed: The Soul, because it
        cannot be put into the earth, it comes not out of a tomb, but
        only I have made it be painted amongst the tombs, seeking its
        body, in form of a woman, having her hair dischevelled; The
        Spirit which likewise cannot be put in a grave, I have made to
        be painted in fashion of a man coming out of the earth, not from
        a Tomb. They are all white; so the blackness, that is death, is
        vanquished, and they being whitened, are from henceforward
        incorruptible. </p>
      <p>Now lift up thine eyes on high, and see our King coming,
        crowned and raised again, which hath overcome Death, the
        darknesses, and moistures; behold him in the form wherein our
        Saviour shall come, who shall eternally unite unto him all pure
        and clean souls, and will drive away all impurity and
        uncleanness, as being unworthy to be united to his divine Bidy.
        So by comparison (but first asking leave of the Catholic,
        Apostolic, and Roman Church, to speak in this manner, and
        praying every debonaire soul to permit me to use this
        similitude) see here our white Exilir, which from henceforward
        will inseparably unite unto himself every pure metallic nature,
        changing it into his own most fine silvery nature, rejecting all
        that is impure, strange, and Heterogeneal, or of another kind.
        Blessed be God, which of his goodness gives us grace to be able
        to consider this sparkling white, more perfect and shining than
        any compound nature, and more noble next after the immortal
        soul, than any substance having life, or not having life; for it
        is a quintessence, a most pure silver, that hath passed the
        Coppell, and is seven times refined, saith the royal Prophet
        David. </p>
      <p>It is not needful to inperpret what the two Angels signify,
        that play on Instruments over the heads of them which are raised
        again: These are rather divine spirits, singing the mervails of
        God in this miraculous operation, than Angels that call to
        judgement. To make an express difference between these and them,
        I have given the one of them a Lute, the other a haultboy, but
        none of them trumpets, which yet are wont to be given to them
        that are to call us to Judgement. The like may be said of the
        three Angels, which are over the head of our Saviour, whereof
        the one crowneth him, and the other two assisting, say in their
        Rowles, O PATER OMNIPOTENS, O JESU BONE, that is, O Almighty
        Father, O good Jesu, in rendering unto him eternal thanks. </p>

            colour, and their Rowles.</b> </p>
        <p><img src="flam6.gif" height="287" width="493"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This violet and blue field showeth that being to pass from the
        white stone to the red, thou must inbibe it with a little
        virgins milk of the Sun, and that these colours come out of the
        Mercurial moisture which thou hast dried upon the Stone. In this
        operation of rubifying, although thou do imbibe, thou shalt not
        have much black, but of violets, blue and of the colour of the
        Peacocks tail. For our stone is so triumphant in dryness, that
        as soon as thy Mercury toucheth it, the nature thereof rejoicing
        in his like nature, it is joined unto it, and drinketh it
        greedily, and therefore the black that comes of moisture, can
        show itself but a little, and that under these colours violet
        and blue, because that dryness (as is said) doth by and by
        govern absolutely. </p>
      <p>I have also made to be painted for thee, these two Angels with
        wings, to represent unto thee, that the two substances of thy
        confections, the Mercurial and the Sulphurous substance, the
        fixed as well as the volatile, being perfectly fixed together,
        do also fly together within thy vessel: for in this operation,
        the fixed body will gently mount to heaven, being all spiritual,
        and from thence it will descend unto the earth, and
        whethersoever thou wilt, following everywhere the Spirit, which
        is always moved upon the fire: Inasmuch as they are made one
        selfsame nature, and the compound is all spiritual, and the
        spiritual all corporall, so much hath it been subtilized upon
        our Marble, by the precedent operations. The natures then are
        here transmuted into Angels, that is to say, are made spiritual
        and most subtle, so are they now the true tinctures. </p>
      <p>Now remember thee to begin the rubifying, by the apposition of
        Mercury Citrine red, but thou must not pour on much, and only
        once or twice, according as thou shalt see occasion; for this
        operation ought to be done by a dry fire, and by a dry
        sublimation and calcination. And truely I tell thee here a
        secret which thou shalt very seldom find written, so far am I
        from being envious, that would to God every man knew how to make
        gold to his own will, that they might live, and lead forth to
        pasture their fair flocks, without Usury or going to Law, in
        imitation of the holy Patriarchs using only (as our first
        Fathers did) to exchange one thing for another; and yet to have
        that, they must labour as well as now. </p>
      <p>Howbeit for fear to offend God, and to be the instrument of
        such a change which prove evil, I must take heed to represent or
        write where it is that we hide the keys, which can open all the
        doors of the secrets of nature, or to open or cast up the earth
        in that place, contenting myself to show the things which will
        teach everyone to whom God shall give permission to know what
        property the sign of the Balance or Libra hath, when it is
        inlightened by the Sun and Mercury in the month of October. </p>
      <p>These Angels are painted of an orange colour, to let thee know
        that thy white confections have been a little more digested, or
        boiled, and that the black of the violet and blue hath been
        already chafed away by the fire: for this orange colour is
        compounded of the fair golden Citrine red (which thou hast so
        long waited for) and of the remainder of this violet and blue,
        which thou hast already in part banished and undone. Furthermore
        this orange colour showeth that the natures are digested, and by
        little and little perfected by the grace of God. </p>
      <p>As for their Rowle, which saith, SVRGITE MORTVI, VENITE AD
        IVDICIVM DOMINI MEI, that is, Arise you dead, and come unto the
        judgement of God my Lord; I have made it be put there, only for
        the Theological sense, rather than any other: It ends in the
        throat of a Lion which is all red, to teach that this operation
        must not be discontinued until they see the true red purple,
        wholly like unto the Poppy of the Hermitage, and the vermillion
        of the painted Lion saving for multiplying. </p>

      <p>Look upon this woman clothed in a robe of orange colour, which
        doth so naturally resemble Perrenelle as she was in her youth;
        She is painted in the fashion of a suppliant upon her knees, her
        hands joined together, at the feet of a man which hath a key in
        his right hand, which hears her graciously, and afterwards
        stretcheth out his left hand upon her. Wouldest thou know what
        this meaneth? This is the Stone, which in this operation
        demandeth two things, of the Mercury of the Sun, of the
        Philosophers (painted under the form of a man) that is to say
        Multiplication, and a more rich Accoustrement; which at this
        time it is needful for her to obtain, and therefore the man so
        laying his hand upon her shoulder accords and grants it unto
        her. But why have I made to be painted a woman? I could as well
        have made to be painted a man as a woman, or an Angel rather,
        (for the whole natures are now spiritual and corporal, masculine
        and feminine), but I have rather chosen to cause paint a woman,
        to the end that thou mayest judge that she demands rather this
        than any other thing, because these are the most natural and
        proper desires of a woman. </p>
      <p>To show further unto thee that she demandeth Multiplication, I
        have made paint the man, unto whom she addresseth her prayers in
        the form of Saint Peter, holding a key, having power to open and
        to shut, to bind and to loose, because the envious Philosophers
        have never spoken of Multiplication, but under the common terms
        of Art, APERI, CLAVDE, SOLVE, LIGA, that is, Open, shut, bind,
        loose, opening and loosing, they have called the making of the
        Body (which is always hard and fixt) soft fluid, and running
        like water: To shut and to bind, is with them afterwards by a
        more strong decoction to coagulate it, and to bring it back
        again into the form of a body. </p>
      <p>It behoved me then, in this place to represent a man with a
        key, to teach thee that thou must now open and shut, that is to
        say, Multiply the budding and encreasing natures: for look how
        often thou shalt dissolve and fix, so often will these natures
        multiply, in quantity, quality, and vertue, according to the
        multiplication of ten; coming from this number to an hundred,
        from an hundred to a thousand, from a thousand to ten thousand,
        from ten thousand to an hundred thousand, from an hundred
        thousand to a million, and from thence by the same operation to
        Infinity, as I have done three times, praised be God. And when
        thy Elixir is so brought unto Infinity, one grain thereof
        falling upon a quantity of molten metal as deep and vast as the
        Ocean, it will teine it, and convert it into most perfect metal,
        that is to say, into silver or gold, according as it shall have
        been imbibed and fermented, expelling and drying out far from
        himself all the impure and strange matter, which was joined with
        the metal in the first coagulation: for this reason therefore
        have I made to be painted a Key in the hand of the man, which is
        in the form of Saint Peter, to signify that the stone desireth
        to be opened and shut for multiplication, and likewise to show
        thee with what Mercury thou oughtest to do this, &amp; when; I
        have given the man a garment Citrine red, and the woman one of
        orange colour. </p>
      <p>Let this suffice, lest I transgress the silence of Pythagoras,
        to teach thee that the woman, that is, our stone, asketh to have
        the rich Accoustrements and colour of Saint Peter. She hath
        written in her Rowle, CHRISTE PRECOR ESTO PIVS, that is, Jesu
        Christ be pitiful unto me, as if she said, Lord be good unto me,
        and suffer not that he that shall become thus far, should spoil
        all with too much fire: It is true, that from henceforward I
        shall no more fear mine enemies, and that all fire shall be
        alike unto me, yet the vessel that contains me, is always
        brittle and easy to be broken: for if they exalt the fire
        overmuch, it will crack and flying a pieces, will carry me and
        sow me unfortunately amongst the ashes. </p>
      <p>Take heed therefore to thy fire in this place, and govern
        sweetly with patience, this admirable quintescence, for the fire
        must be augmented unto it, but not too much. And pray the
        soveraign Goodness, that it will not suffer the evil spirits
        which keep the Mines and Treasures, to destroy thy work, or to
        bewitch thy sight, when thou considereth these incomprehensible
        motions of this quintescence within thy vessel. </p>

        obtained by her full decoction, the fair Garments, that are
        wholly Citrine and red, which she demanded of Saint Peter, who
        was clothed therewith, and that her complete and perfect
        digestion (signified by the entire Citrinity) hath made her
        leave her old robe of orange colour. The vermilion red colour of
        this flying Lion, like the pure and clear scarlet in grain,
        which is of the true Granadored, demonstrates that it is now
        accomplished in all right and equality. And that she is now like
        a Lion, devouring every pure metallic nature, and changing it
        into her true substance, into true and pure gold, more fine than
        that of the best mines. </p>
      <p>Also she now carrieth this man out of this vale of miseries,
        that is to say, out of the discommodities of poverty and
        infirmity, and with her wings gloriously lifts him up, out of
        the dead and standing waters of AEgypt, (which are the ordinary
        thoughts of mortal men) making him despise this life and the
        riches thereof, and causing him night and day to meditate on
        God, and his Saints, to swell in the Emperial heaven, and to
        drink the sweet springs of the Fountains of everlasting hope. </p>
      <p>Praised be God eternally, which hath given us grace to see this
        most fair and all-perfect purple colour; this pleasant colour of
        the wild poppy of the Rock, this Tyrian, sparkling and flaming
        colour, which is incapable of Alternation or change, over which
        the heaven itself, nor his Zodiac can have no more domination
        nor power, whose bright shining rays, that dazzle the eyes, seem
        as though they did communicate unto a man some supercelestial
        thing, making him (when he beholds and knows it) to be
        astonished, to tremble, and to be afraid at the same time. </p>
      <p>Oh Lord, give us grace to use it well, to the augmentation of
        the Faith, to the profit of our Souls, and to the encrease of
        the glory of this noble Realm. Amen. </p>
