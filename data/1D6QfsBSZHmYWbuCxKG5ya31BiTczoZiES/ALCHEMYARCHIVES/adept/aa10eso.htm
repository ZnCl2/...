      <font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alchemy</b> has taken
        several novel forms in modern times. Some researchers are
        pioneering the arcana of physical alchemy in cold fusion and
        biological transmutation, nuclear waste remediation, etc. Others
        continue to rediscover traditional methods and philosophy, and
        to transmit revelation. There is considerable overlapping of
        domains, such as acoustic manipulation of force fields
        (Quabbalah, John Keely's discoveries and inventions, cymatics,
        acoustic refrigeration, sonochemistry, sonoluminesence, &amp;c),
        Astrochemy (Aether, phlogiston, gur, Wilhelm Reich's orgone,
        orene &amp;c), Astrobiochemy (Reich's bions, Andrew Crosse's
        abiogenesis of acari, homeopathy, spagyry, &amp;c), and
        Magnetism (Nuclear magnetic resonance, para- &amp;
        dia-magnetism, &amp;c). Alchemy also figures in future history,
        according to Michel Nostradamus and other prophets.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical quabbalah
          (causality engineering) comprises the combination of specific
          colors, frequencies, elements (fire, air, water, earth &amp;
          akasa; O, N, H, Si, C) and geometries to produce specific
          effects in akasa and in the mental, astral and physical
          worlds. This form of quabbalah (based on the <i>Sephir </i>Zohar,





          Short Version) is taught by the great Hermetic adept Franz
          Bardon in his <i>Key to the True Quabbalah</i>, excerpted
          here:</font> </p>

      <p><font size="-0"><i><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material</u></i>: "By
          the "C" oscillation, the quabbalist learns to enliven the
          whole of the matter and to equip it with mental as well as
          with astral virtues, powers, etc. By this letter, he also
          learns to impregnate quabbalistically any material form at
          will. Furthermore, the true <b>quabbalistic alchemy</b> is
          also influenced by this letter oscillation. By the term
          "quabbalistic alchemy" the "modification of matter by the
          word" is to be understood, which is equivalent to giving it
          another quality."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OE </b>[Tone: D# ~

      </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akasa</i>: "In the akasa
          principle, the "OE" oscillation, evokes the most profound
          cognition which can only be brought about by <b>love divine</b>,
          apart from the knowledge that is called the <b>quabbalistic
            quintessence</b>. By the help of this oscillation, the
          quabbalist gets to know all the possibilities of <b>transformation
of





            the spirit</b>, all the systems and ways serving this end,
          and all knowledge concerning transformation in all other
          fields. He is informed about everything that, deriving from
          the act of creation, had to pass through all the modes of
          transformation to be reunited. The quabbalist must attain all
          the faculties that are offered by the "OE" oscillation in the
          akasa principle, must make use of all the possibilities, in
          order to get convinced that they cannot be described by words,
          but must be experienced, lived through.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have mentioned the
          letters "AE" and "OE" as the last ones in this series of
          exercises, because by the help of their oscillations one is
          able to comprehend, from the akasa principle, the crown of all
          wisdom in the micro- and macrocosms, from the act of creation
          to the present state of evolution, and even to the final
          development.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental</i>: "Evoked in
          the mental kingdom, the "OE" oscillation will secure the
          perfect mastery of <b>quabbalistic alchemy</b>. By this, one
          understands the transformation of ideas, virtues, etc., by the
          quabbalistically pronounced word, which is a very great and
          comprehensive field.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Astral</i>: "In the
          astral kingdom, the "OE" oscillation develops the faculty of
          perfect <b>astral projection</b> and the mastery of all
          occult and magical phenomena that have reference to <b>transformation</b>,
          so that the quabbalist may, for instance, assume any desired
          form in the astral body without being recognized by other
          beings and with only Divine Providence seeing through him.
          Apart from this, the quabbalist is able to transform any
          astral oscillation into the oscillation he wants and to do the
          same with any element.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material</i>: "When
          mastered in the physical body, the "OE" oscillation will lead
          to perfect knowledge of <b>quabbalistic alchemy</b> in the
          material world. The quabbalist is taught the true preparation
          and charging of the philosopher's stone in the physical sense.
          As he can influence, at will, any oscillation -- atomic
          oscillation, electronic oscillation -- by quabbalah, and as he
          is able to transform it into the oscillation desired by him,
          he naturally also perfectly masters the laws of transmutation.
          Therefore, he is able to transform any metal into gold, any
          stone into a precious stone, etc., if he wishes to do so. By
          the help of this oscillation the quabbalist will be furnished
          with many other faculties of which he cannot even dream now
          and which non-initiates would regard as absolutely impossible.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - OE ~ </b>"This
          twofold key imparts the faculty of solving any problem of
          quabbalistic alchemy with effortless ease. The formula
          magician uses this formula for his students who have
          difficulties in delving into the problems of quabbalistic
          alchemy. If one is in doubt about a formula, particularly when
          experimenting on alchemistic transformation based on
          quabbalah, concerning the change of a power or ability, etc.,
          or if there are difficulties in applying a formula, then one
          should resort to this formula, for it will evoke the desired
          faculty.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - OE ~ </b>"Using this
          formula, the formula magician projects the electromagnetic
          fluid in the form of light and warmth, in order to be able to
          evoke any phenomena of astral projection. By this twofold key,
          he is also able to enliven any kind of medicine and to make it
          bring on better results. Since this formula also contains the
          secret of forming the mental matrix for the production of the
          philosopher's stone, the formula magician will be given the
          faculty of enlivening any material object to his own liking.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - H ~ </b>"Through
          this twofold key, the formula magician may obtain mercy from
          Divine Providence and influence his own or somebody else's
          fate at will. If embodied into food and drink, the "C-H"
          formula will bring on the realization of all wishes. If clear
          water is influenced by this formula after 4 drops of quinta
          essentia universalis --- alchemistic universal tincture ---
          were given into it, the person who drinks this impregnated
          water will be given the donation of having any material wish
          fulfilled that he or she may utter in connection with this
          formula. At the same time, a rejuvenation, a prolongation of
          life and perfect health may be obtained by embodying the "C-H"
          formula into the <i>quinta essentia</i>, i.e., by enlivening
          the same. Alchemists who do not know all this, usually fail in
          preparing the <i>quinta essentia</i>, since they are not able
          to enliven the same mentally. The universal tincture has not
          only to be charged materially, but it must also be charged and
          influenced with the analogous connections in an astral and
          mental manner, apart from other irradiations connected to the
          quadripolar magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - OE</b>~ "In the
          mental body, the "C-OE" formula reveals the secrets of alchemy
          in all its phases, and makes one see the true connections to
          the universal law. In the astral body, it arouses the faculty
          of permanent astral projection, no matter whether the
          projection of universal light, fluids, elements or any other
          phenomena of transformation is in question. In the material
          world, this formula, if embodied in food and drink, turns
          every formula magician into a perfect alchemist who is
          equipped with all relevant knowledge, abilities, etc. This
          formula is particularly important for those formula magicians
          who want to become perfect alchemists one day." <b>(1)</b></font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angelic Stone, the
          ultimate degree of the Philosophers' Stone, is the
          quabbalistic formula revealed by the Grace of God in
          "Alchemia", the frontispiece to this book.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franz Bardon also published
          <i>The Practice of Magical Evocation,</i> in which he
          introduced several genii who are concerned with alchemy in the
          Earth zone and other planetary spheres. These spirits can
          provide invaluable assistance to the magician-alchemist who
          contacts them in the correct manner. Any error in this regard
          can trap the magus-alchemist in a Faustian bargain, which is
          completely unnecessary and avoidable:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andimo </i>~ "Since he
          is well acquainted with alchemy he may also assist,
          theoretically and practically, the magician in this respect.
          My own experience makes me point out to every magician that
          Andimo may easily tempt him to project physically, either
          directly by himself or by the help of one of hi subjects, a
          burning stone, the so-called "living sulfur". If, in such a
          case, the magician, during the projection of the stone, takes
          the stone into his hand, he will get badly burned by it.
          Andimo likes to place such stones before the magician's feet
          or before the magic circle. You must leave this stone
          untouched and order Andimo to take it away. If the magician
          touches the burning sulfur transmuted by Andimo from the
          principle of the earth (i.e., transmuted by the principles of
          Alchemy), with the sign of Andimo's seal, which he earlier
          drew on a piece of parchment, the seal will catch fire and the
          sulfur stone at once turns into the true alchemical projection
          powder of a red color, the so-called "red lion". This powder
          then is quite safe and may be gathered up with a glass spoon
          and stored away in a well shut-up glass. This kind of
          projection powder usually has a projection capacity of
          1:10,000 and is the philosopher's stone in its purest form.
          However, the magician may then be tempted to use this powder
          for making gold or prolonging his own life. If the magician is
          misled by such temptations he would conclude, by such
          alchemical operations, a formal pact with the said being. The
          magician is therefore warned in advance not to do such a
          rashness and never to practice alchemy in such a manner. Not
          even in case he assumes that he is mature and experienced
          enough in everything that has to do with the science of magic,
          for he might, nevertheless, be misled to take an
          ill-considered step. When dealing personally with Andimo I had
          the opportunity of convincing myself of these facts, but I
          ordered Andimo to take the powder back to his kingdom. At that
          moment it disappeared at once, with a hissing sound.</font> </p>

        aggregates harmonically united constitute centers of vibration
        bearing relation to the fundamental pitch not multiples of the
        harmonic pitch, and the production of secondary unions between
        themselves generate pitches that are discords, either in their

        linear dimensions from one period of frequency per unit of time
        to the 21st octave above, producing the creative force of
        Sonity, whose transmissive force (Sound) is propagated through
        the media of solids, liquids, and gases, and whose static effect
        (Sonism) produces attractions and repulsions between

        creative forcce (Thermism), whose transmissive force
        (Rad-energy) propagated in solid, liquid, and gaseous ether,

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholium:</i> The phenomenon of Dynamic
        Electricity through a metallic conductor and of induction are
        identical. In a metallic conductor, the transmission is from
        atom to atom, through homologous interstices, filled with ether,
        presenting small areas in close proximity. In crystalline
        structures, heat, which expands the atoms, by twisting them
        produces striae, increases the resistance, etc. Between parallel
        wires and through air the induction takes place from large areas
        through a rarefied medium composed of a mixture of substances,
        whose atoms are separated by waves of repulsion of various
        pitches, discordant to electric vibrations; the said atoms
        sympathetically absorb the vibrations and dissipate from
        themselves, as centers, concentric waves of electric energy
        which produces heat and gravism." </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (16) Law of Oscillating Atomoles ~</i><b>
        </b>"Atomoles oscillating at a uniform pitch (determined by
        their uniform size and weight) produce the creative force
        Atomolity, whose transmissive form, Gravism, is propagated

forces





        are different forms of Universal Energy unlike in their period-
        frequency, merging into each other by imperceptible increments;
        each form representing the compass of 21 octaves. Each form or
        pitch may be transformed into an equivalent quantity of another
        pitch above or below it in the scale of 105 octaves. The
        transformation can occur only through its static effect,
        developing vibrations of harmonic pitches above or below their
        fundamental vibration, or developing with juxtaposed aggregates,
        resultant and difference, or third order, as the case may be. </p>

          Rad-Energy ~</i><b> </b>"The higher harmonics and overtones
        of projected rad-energy are of a pitch sufficiently high to
        cause the atom to expand; by causing the atomoles to vibrate
        systematically the same influence will cause the atom to
        contract, and thus by changing the volume, atomic pitch is
        varied." </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule:</i> The gradual approach of the
        temperature of harmonic combination can be observed by mutually
        comparing superimposed spectra; chemical combination commences

        by linear measurement." </p>

        a resultant of the atomic weight, atomic volume, and tension." </p>

        natural relations to atomic weights, pitches, specific heats,

          researched by Hans Jenny in the 1960s. He demonstrated the
          basic unified triadic phenomenon of vibrational, kinetic and
          dynamic effects in acoustic interactions with matter. The
          triadic phenomenon occurs in many other fields (biology,

          key that unlocks many gates of knowledge. Certainly it aids in
          understanding and practicing quabbalistic transmutation, and
          pertains to the work of John Keely and Dr Stephen Emmens. For

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another interesting and
          important fact with this process of vitalization is, those
          salts that are otherwise insoluble in water are by the
          evaporation of water rendered soluble. This is a most valuable
          discovery from the standpoint of treating disease, as all the
          mineral salts must be dissolved in the blood before they are
          available to the tissue cells as food.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I began my experiments by
          attempting mind control of one or more of these salts
          dissolved in distilled water. First, a drop of the mineral
          solution was put on the glass slide of my microscope, then
          placed in a temperature nearly that of the human body. As the
          water dried away, I would repeat the [unspecified Biblical]
          verse referred to above, the mystic three times.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "While doing this I would
          image, or mentally picture, the form of some fowl or animal as
          the victim of the bleeding. Finally, I succeeded in making the
          crystals of common table salt, which is the most abundant salt
          in the blood, group themselves in the form of a chicken.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long before I succeeded,
          there built up from the mineral solutions a great variety of
          microscopic organisms in the shape of octupi, fish, and
          reptiles. I do not know why.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continued experiments
          demonstrated that forms of different kinds could be <i>predetermined</i>
          by the proportion, number, and kind of salts used. Thus I
          discovered that <i>mineral composition</i> is the law of
          living forms... These laws may be stated as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "1. A mental image is the
          beginning of every created thing. With whatever functions,
          faculties or qualities this image may be endowed by the mind
          creating it, the same will be expressed by the creature.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "2. This mental image has
          the power to group the twelve mineral salts normally found in
          organic nature, in the exact proportion necessary to build the
          form, and all the tissues and organs necessary to express all
          the functions, faculties and qualities which the mind image
          may be endowed. Hence <i>composition </i>becomes the <i>law</i>
          of form and function.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "3. Evaporation of water, a
          process universal on sea and land, generates <i>a subtle
            magnetism</i> which is the vital force of plants and
          animals. This force saturates the mineral salts of organic
          nature making them susceptible to mental control, so that any
          picture that the mind accepts as true in principle may be
          fixed in them...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Procure twelve one-ounce
          bottles with fresh, clean corks. Label each bottle with the
          name of the salt it is to contain. Into each bottle put about
          10 grains of one of the salts and fill with pure distilled
          water. Shake frequently. Not all the salts are equally
          soluble, some in large amounts and others only slightly.</font>

          drop of any one of the solutions with a clean toothpick to the

          the water is evaporated. Then examine the crystal formed from
          the salt. Do this with each of the twelve salts until you
          become familiar with their forms and differences. Then combine
          one or more of the solutions in a clean bottle. Place a drop
          of this on the glass slide, then evaporate and examine. It
          will be seen by these experiments that the slightest
          difference in the amounts of each solution will make the
          widest possible difference in the resulting crystals...</font>

          sulfate of potash and sulfate of soda, one part of the potash
          to ten parts of the soda. When this combination forms crystals
          like the letters C, D, or O, then the solution of these salts
          is susceptible to mental mastery by my mind...</font> </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Littlefield also claimed
          to have produced microbial flora with simple experiments that
          anyone could test. <i>Scientific American </i>magazine (30
          September 1905) offered the following instructions and
          description of the operation:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The supplies... comprise a
          large but shallow glass vessel, having a capacity of one
          quart, several smaller dishes, a bell jar sufficiently large
          to inclose those receptacles, and finally, a good high-powered
          microscope. The chemicals used are sodium chloride, alcohol,
          ammonia, and distilled water. In the larger vessel 2 ounces of
          the salt are dissolved in 6 ounces of the water, and when this
          is done 6 ounces of 90% pure alcohol is added.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A portion of the solution
          thus formed is poured out of the larger into the smaller
          dishes, when 2 ounces of aqua ammonia is stirred in with a
          clean glass rod, and the bell jar is then placed over them. A
          chemical reaction is set up and in the course of a few minutes
          bubbles of hydrogen will begin to form on the surface of the
          fluid, and a closer observation will show these little spheres
          to be gyrating with high velocity. In the course of half an
          hour the bubbles will cease to form; the liquid is then ready
          for the crucial test. With the microscope at hand and
          previously focused so that a globule of the unstable solution
          may be quickly observed, a very small portion is transferred
          from the dish to the glass slide... On examination the
          detached particles of matter are seen moving through the
          medium from the center to the circumference with extreme
          rapidity, and continued investigation indicates other changes
          the liquid is undergoing. Crystals begin to appear, and those
          first formed are the characteristic transparent cubes of
          sodium chloride, and hence these are incapable of further
          development. After these, other crystals follow, and some
          assume a hexagonal form on the surface of the saturated
          solution, and it is from these that the growth of the
          elementary organisms is said to take place...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The growth of this supposed
          rudimentary vital element next follows in sequence, and as it
          metamorphosed from the hexagonal crystal into a free, smooth,
          disk-shaped cell, we are informed that it bears a close
          resemblance to a red-blood corpuscle. The cellular disk now
          gradually expands in a direction at right angles to is
          surfaces and an ovoid form results from which pseudopodia or
          temporary extensions protrude similar to the amoeba...</font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Littlefield went so far
          as to claim that he had produced a microscopic insect formerly
          unknown to entomology:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It resembled a common
          house-fly, having two antennae protruding from its head, while
          from its body grew six attenuated legs, the two nearest its
          head being of the comparative form and length of a
          grasshopper, while its transparent wings were covered with
          light hair. This new insect is the outcome of thousands of
          experiments, and it has no counterpart in the textbooks
          dealing with that branch of zoology."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obvious criticism is
          that Dr Littlefield failed to conduct his experiments with
          sterile equipment. <b>(8, 13)</b></font> </p>
      <p><a name="crosse"></a><b><i>Andrew Crosse<font size="+1"> ~ </font></i></b><font
          size="-0">In 1837, Andrew Crosse reported to the London
          Electrical Society concerning the accidental spontaneous
          generation of life forms while he was attempting to produce
          artificial crystals with the influence of a voltaic cell. He
          produced acari insects repeatedly in many carefully controlled
          experiments under a wide variety of conditions utterly
          inimical to life as we know it. The experimental details are
          repeated here in extended quotation to facilitate your own
          experiments:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the course of my
          endeavors to form artificial minerals by a long continued
          electric action on fluids holding in solution such substances
          as were necessary to my purpose, I had recourse to every
          variety of contrivance which I could think of, so that, on the
          one hand, I might be enabled to keep up a never-failing
          electrical current of greater or less intensity or quantity,
          or both, as the case seemed to require... Amongst other
          contrivances, I constructed a wooden frame, of about two feet
          in height, consisting of four legs proceeding from a shelf at
          the bottom; supporting another at the top, and containing a
          third in the middle. Each of these shelves was about 7 inches
          square. The upper one was pierced with an aperture, in which
          was fixed a funnel of Wedgwood ware, within which rested a
          quart basin on a circular piece of mahogany placed within the
          funnel. When this basin was filled with a fluid, a strip of
          flannel wetted with the same, was suspended over the edge of
          the basin and inside the funnel which, acting as a siphon,
          conveyed the fluid out of the basin, through the funnel, in
          successive drops. The middle shelf of the frame was likewise
          pierced with an aperture, in which was fixed a smaller funnel
          of glass, which supported a piece of somewhat porous red oxide
          of iron from Vesuvius, immediately under the dropping of the
          upper funnel. The stone was kept constantly electrified by
          means of two platina wires on either side of it, connected
          with the poles of a voltaic battery of 19 pairs of 5-inch zinc
          and copper single plates, in 2 porcelain troughs, the cells of
          which were filled at first with water and 1/300 of
          hydrochloric acid, but afterward with water alone... The lower
          shelf merely supported a wide mouth bottle, to receive the
          drops as they fell from the second funnel... It was by mere
          chance that I selected this volcanic substance, choosing it
          from its partial porosity; nor do I believe that it has the
          slightest effect in the production of the insects to be
          described. The fluid with which I filled the basin was made as
          follows.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To a portion of the
          silicate of potassa... I added some boiling water to dilute
          it, and then slowly added hydrochloric acid to
          supersaturation... My object in subjecting this fluid to a
          long-continued action, through the intervention of a porous
          stone, was to form, if possible, crystals of silica to one of
          the poles of the battery, but I failed in accomplishing this
          by those means. On the 14th day from the commencement of the
          experiment, I observed, through a lens, a few small whitish
          excrescences or nipples projecting from about the middle of
          the electrified stone, and nearly under the dropping of the
          fluid above. On the 18th day, these projections enlarged, and
          7 or 8 filaments, each of them longer than the excrescence
          from which it grew, made their appearance on each of the
          nipples. On the 22nd day, these appearances were more elevated
          and distinct, and on the 26th day, each figure assumed the
          form of a perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles
          which formed its tail. Till this period I had no notion that
          these appearances were any other than an incipient mineral
          formation; but it was not until the 28th day, when I plainly
          perceived these little creatures move their legs, that I felt
          any surprise, and I must own that when this took place, I was
          not a little astonished. I endeavored to detach, with the
          point of a needle, one or two of them from its position on the
          stone, but they immediately died, and I was obliged to wait
          patiently for a few days longer, when they separated
          themselves from the stone, and moved about at pleasure,
          although they had been for some time after their birth
          apparently averse to motion. In the course of a few weeks,
          about a hundred of them made their appearance on the stone. I
          observed that at first each of them fixed itself for a
          considerable time in one spot, appearing, as far as I could
          judge, to feed itself by suction; but when a ray of light from
          the sun was directed upon it, it seemed disturbed, and removed
          itself to the shaded part of the stone. Out of about a hundred
          insects, not above 5 or 6 were born on the south side of the
          stone. I examined some of them with the microscope, and
          observed that the smaller ones appeared to have only 6 legs,
          but the larger ones 8... It seems that they are of the genus <i>Acarus</i>,
          but of a species not hitherto observed...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never ventured an
          opinion as to the cause of their birth, and for a very good
          reason --- I was unable to form one.."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crosse repeated his
          experiments with more carefully controlled conditions and
          obtained similar results. Other experiments utilized copper
          nitrate and sulfate, iron and zinc sulfates, hydrochloric
          acid, and arsenic; the acari appeared in every cell but those
          containing arsenic and potassium carbonate. In one of the
          simplest experiments that produced acari, Crosse proceeded
          thus:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A bent wire, 1/5th of an
          inch in diameter, in the form of an inverted siphon, was
          plunged some inches into [a concentrated solution of silicate
          of potassa] and connected with the positive pole, whilst a
          small coil of fine silver wire joined it with the negative.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After some months'
          electrical action, gelatinous silica enveloped both wires, but
          in much greater quantity at the positive pole; and in about 8
          months from the commencement of the experiment, on examining
          these 2 wires very minutely... I plainly perceived one of
          these incipient insects upon the gelatinous silica on the
          silver wire, and about half an inch below the surface of the
          fluid, when replaced in its original position. In the course
          of time, more insects made their appearance, till, at last, I
          counted at once 3 on the negative and 12 on the positive wire.
          Some of them were formed on the naked part of the wires, that
          is, on that part which was partially bare of gelatinous
          silica: but they were mostly embedded more or less in the
          silica, with 8 or 10 filaments projecting from each beyond the
          silica... I must not omit to state, that the room... was kept
          almost completely darkened...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not observed a
          formation of an insect, except on a moist and electrified
          surface, or under an electrified fluid... These insects do not
          appear to have originated from others similar to themselves,
          as they are formed in all cases with access of moisture, and
          in some cases 2 inches below the surface of the fluid in which
          they are born; and if a full-grown and perfect insect be let
          fall into any fluid, it is infallibly drowned. I believe they
          live for many weeks: occasionally I have found them dead in
          groups, apparently from want of food...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have obtained the insects
          on a bare platina wire plunged into fluo-silicic acid, <i>one
            inch below</i> the surface of the fluid at the negative pole
          of a small battery of 2-inch plates in cells filled with
          water. This is somewhat a singular fluid for these insects to
          breed in, who seem to have a flinty taste, although they are
          by no means confined to siliceous fluids...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have closely examined the
          progress of these insects. Their first appearance consists in
          a very minute whitish hemisphere, formed upon the surface of
          the electrified body, sometimes at the positive end, and
          sometimes at the negative, and occasionally between the two,
          or in the middle of the electrified current; and sometimes
          upon all. In a few days this speck enlarges and elongates
          vertically, and shoots out filaments of a whitish wavy
          appearance, and easily seen through a lens of very low power.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then commences the first
          appearance of animal life. If a fine point be made to approach
          these filaments, they immediately shrink up and collapse like
          zoophytes upon moss, but expand again some time after the
          removal of the point. Some days afterwards these filaments
          become legs and bristles, and a perfect acarus is the result,
          which finally detaches itself from its birthplace, and if
          under a fluid, climb up the electrified wire and escapes from
          the vessel... If one of them be afterwards thrown into the
          fluid in which he was produced, he is immediately drowned... I
          have never before heard of acari having been produced under a
          fluid, or of their ova throwing out filaments; nor have I ever
          observed any ova previous to or during electricization, except
          that the speck which throws out the filaments be an ovum; but
          when a number of these insects, in a perfect state,
          congregate, ova are produced."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abiogenesis of acari
          discovered by Andrew Crosse was investigated carefully by
          Weeks; he took every precaution to ensure the sterility of the
          equipment and reagents in a series of electrified experiments
          conducted with unelectrified controls. Acari eventually and
          invariably appeared, in numbers depending approximately on the
          percentage of carbon in the mother liquor. Weeks reported his
          results to the Electrical Society. <b>(5)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1837, Michael Faraday
          stated in a paper read to the Royal Institution, that he too
          had encountered manifestations of similar insects in the
          course of some of his own electrical experiments. He was
          uncertain, however, whether their appearance was due to
          revivification of dormant ova, or formation <i>in vitro</i>.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1940s, Dr Wilhelm
          Reich announced his discovery of the Orgone life force and the
          technology to utilize it. One of the areas he investigated
          involved the abiogenesis of "Bions". Reich also managed to
          crystallize the atmospheric orgone in vacuum tube orgone
          accumulators. He named this form "Orene". A polluted form of
          orgone called DOR (Deadly Orgone) was found to be associated
          with radioactivity. It can be rectified with geometry, etc.
          The discovery of orgone gives new credence to the old
          alchemical concept of Phlogiston, and it serves as a basis for
          some astral technologies.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decades later, the Canadian
          Dr Gustaf Naessans also discovered novel life forms
          reminiscent of Reich's bions, and implicated them in the
          pathology of cancer. Naessans developed a revolutionary
          cure(lymphatic injections of "camphorminium chloride") based
          on his discoveries.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of an aether was
          defined by Larousse as "an imponderable fluid, filling space
          and forming the source of light, heat, electricity, etc." The
          aether was a cornerstone of many physics theories until
          Einstein prevailed with his Theory of Relativity. Modern
          quantum mechanics and other post-relativistic physics
          theories, however, require an aether or something just like
          it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor D. Mendeleeff,
          developer of the periodic table of atomic elements, published
          a fascinating booklet in 1904: "An Attempt towards a Chemical
          Conception of the Ether". Mendeleeff explained the ether as
          follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ether may be said to be
          a gas, like helium or argon, incapable of chemical
          combination... This point lies at the basis of our
          investigation into the chemical nature of ether, and includes
          the following two fundamental propositions: (1) that the ether
          is the lightest (in this respect ultimate) gas, and is endowed
          with a high penetrating power, which signifies that its
          particles have, relatively to other gases, small weight and
          extremely high velocity, and (2) that ether is a simple body
          (element) incapable of entering into combination or reaction
          with other elements or compounds, although capable of
          penetrating their substance, just as helium, argon, and their
          analogues are soluble in water and other liquids.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When in 1869 I first showed
          the periodic dependence of the properties of the elements upon
          their atomic weights, no element incapable of forming definite
          compounds was known, nor was the existence of such an element
          even suspected. Therefore the periodic system was arranged by
          me in groups, series, and periods, starting in group I. and
          series I., with hydrogen as the lightest and least dense of
          all the elements. Guided by this system, I was able to predict
          both the existence of several elements and also their physical
          and chemical properties in a free and combined state. These
          elements, gallium, scandium, and germanium, were subsequently
          discovered by Lecoq de Boisbraudan, Nilson, and Winkler
          respectively. I made these predictions by following what is
          known in mathematics as a method of interpolation, that is, by
          finding intermediate points by means of two extreme points
          whose relative position is known. The fact of my predictions
          having proved true confirmed the periodic system of the
          elements, which may now be considered as an absolute law. So
          long as the law remained unconfirmed, it was not possible to
          extrapolate (i.e. to determine points beyond the limits of the
          known) by its means, but now such a method may be followed,
          and I have ventured to do so in the following remarks on the
          ether, as an element lighter than hydrogen. My reason for
          doing this was determined by two considerations. In the first
          place, I think I have not many years for delay; and in the
          second place, in recent years there has been much talk about
          the division of atoms into more minute electrons, and it seems
          to me that such ideas are not so much metaphysical as
          metachemical, proceeding from the absence of any definite
          notions upon the chemism of ether, and it is my desire to
          replace such vague ideas by a more real notion of the chemical
          nature of the ether... Those phenomena in which a division of
          atoms is recognized would be better understood as a separation
          or emission of the generally recognized and all-permeating
          ether. In a word, it seems to me that the time has arrived to
          speak of the chemical nature of the ether, all the more so
          since, so far as I know, no one has spoken at all definitely
          on this subject. When I applied the periodic law to the
          analogues of boron, aluminum and silicon, I was 33 years
          younger than now, and I was perfectly confident that sooner or
          later my prediction would be fulfilled. Now I see less clearly
          and my confidence is not so great. Then I risked nothing, now
          I do. This required some courage, which I acquired when I saw
          the phenomena of radioactivity. I then saw that I must not
          delay, that perhaps my imperfect thoughts might lead some one
          to a surer path than that which was opened to my enfeebled
          vision...</font> </p>

          occluded by many substances. Its chief characteristic thus far

          cooling, rapid re-absorption always took place, but was never

          revealed to us through dreams, drugs, religious epiphany,
          magical rituals and the mantic arts. Prophecy has exerted a
          powerful influence on the course of history. Alchemy has been

          size="-0">The great adept Theophrastus von Hohenheim, or
          Paracelsus, was a prolific writer; his publications
          revolutionized medicine in Europe. He made major contributions
          to Western mysticism, including a small book of 32 prophecies
          called <i>Prognosticatio eximii doctoris Theophrasti
            Paracelsi</i> (ca. 1530). Though the predictions were
          written in symbolic terms, several of them have been satisfied
          by history. Several others can be interpreted easily and offer
          a clear view of the apparent future he saw. <b>(10)</b></font>

          4th Monarchy (the millennial new age) with the rediscovery of
          the alchemical Philosophers' Stone by the Grand Monarch, as
          suggested by the following section of a longer prophecy:</font>

          France: that animal was the glyph from which the present
          fleur-de-lys was derived. The bear is Russia, the lion is

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chapter 8 of his treatise
          <i>De Minerabilis</i>, Paracelsus predicted the advent of
          Elias Artista (Elias the Artist), Master of Alchemy. Elsewhere
          in the literature of Hermetic science, Elias Artista is
          referred to as "a symbol of the ripeness of the age! He is the
          great day to come when all secrets shall be brought to light,
          and things now rooting in the dark earth shall be brought to
          light, and things now rooting in the dark earth shall come
          forth to full growth and flower and bear a treasure, which is
          for the healing of nations... a symbolic representation, the
          collective breath of generous vindications. Spirit of Liberty,
          of science and love which must regenerate the world!"</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paracelsus, Glauber, Thomas
          Norton, Alexander Seton and other alchemists wrote of Elias as
          if he were an individual. Paracelsus wrote: "What is small and
          humble, God has revealed, but the more important is still in
          the dark and shall likely remain so until the arrival of Elias
          Artista... One shall come after me whose splendor is not yet
          in this life, and who shall reveal much." According to
          Glauber, "This Elias Artista shall restore the true spagyric
          medicine of the old Egyptian Philosophy which was lost over a
          thousand years. He shall bring it with him and show it to the
          world."</font> </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eminent British
          occultist Arthur E. Waite reprinted the prophecy in
          interpretive prose form in <i>The Hermetic Museum</i>:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This knowledge would often
          have been the glory of England's kings, if their hopes had
          been firmly placed upon God. One who shall have obtained his
          honors by means of this Art, will mend old manners, and change
          them for the better. When he comes, he will reform the
          kingdom, and by his goodness and virtue he will set an
          everlasting example to rulers. In his time the common people
          will rejoice, and render praise to God in mutual neighborly
          love. O King, who are to accomplish all this, pray to God the
          King, and implore His aid in the matter. So the glory of thy
          mind will be crowned with the glory of a golden age, which
          shall not then be hoped for as future."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0"><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michel
              Nostradamus&nbsp;</i></b> ~ The 16th century prophet
          Michel de Notredame (Nostradamus) is considered to be one of
          the greatest prophets of future history. The following
          quatrains contain alchemical themes that may inspire aspiring
          adepts, and certainly confuse them:</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">"The divine word will give to the substance,</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">Including heaven, earth, gold occulted in the
          mystic milk:</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">Body, soul, spirit having all power,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">As much under its feet as the Heavenly see."
          (C.3.2)</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">"When Venus will be covered by the Sun,</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">Under the splendor will be a hidden form:</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">Mercury will have exposed them to the fire,</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">Through warlike noise it will be insulted."
          (C.4.28)</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">"The Sun hidden eclipsed by Mercury</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">Will be placed only second in the sky:</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">Of Vulcan Hermes will be made into food,</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">The Sun will be seen pure, glowing red and
          golden." (C.4.29)</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">"Eleven more times the Moon the Sun will not
          want,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">All raised and lowered by degree:</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">And put so low that one will stitch little gold:</font>
        <br>
        <font size="-0">Such that after famine plague, the secret
          uncovered"(C.4-30)</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">"So much silver of Diana and Mercury,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">The images will be found in the lake:</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">The sculptor looking for new clay,</font> <br>
        <font size="-0">He and his followers will be steeped in
          gold.'(C.9.12)<b>(7)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the closing
          passages of the Biblical Revelation of John, we are promised
          that, "To he who overcomes, I will give a White Stone, and in
          it a New Name written, that is known only to he whom it is
          revealed." This suggests that the Christian survivors of the
          Tribulation will receive the Philosophers' Stone in its
          physical and angelic forms. Amen.</font> </p>
