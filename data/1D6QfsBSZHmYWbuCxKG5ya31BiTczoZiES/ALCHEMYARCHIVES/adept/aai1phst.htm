      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>This anthology</b> of excerpts from the
        literature of Alchemy intends to illustrate certain aspects of
        the Great Work: the correct use of the Philosophers’ Stone, the
        Short or Dry Path, and the Prima Materia. This book will guide
        you directly to the gate of the Philosophers' Garden and provide
        you with its key and password. Pray God to allow you entry,
        grace your labor, and forgive us our trespasses. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not imagine, however, that you can complete the
        Great Work with the information in this book, which purports to
        reveal only the first step of the reaction pathway. Such an
        ignorant&nbsp; presumption could easily result in your premature
        death, rather than enhanced health, longevity, and wealth. Read
        every alchemical text you can find, and learn inorganic
        chemistry at least. If you are chosen to achieve this Magistery,
        it will be revealed to you in due time, and not one second
        earlier. Nor will you complete the work any sooner than God
        allows you, even if you practice the Ars Brevis. <i>Festina
          lente</i>. Indeed, it really should not matter to you whether
        or not the Philosophers Stone is a physical , or that you attain
        it as such; "The true Philosophers' Stone is to have means and
        waste not". It is also simply the Lost Word : <b><a
            href="#aetz">ÆTZI</a></b> ( John 1:1 ), the Angelic Stone.
        And there you have it, given freely. Thank God, and pray for the
        revelation of it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alchemy is not to confused with chemistry,
        archemy, or spagyry. Adeptus Fulcanelli makes the distinctions
        clear in <i>The Dwellings of the Philosophers</i>: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us clearly state, since so many
        educated and sincere people seem unaware of the fact, that the
        real ancestor of our modern chemistry is ancient spagyrics and
        not the hermetic science itself. There is indeed a profound
        abyss between spagyrics and alchemy...Hermetic writings alone,
        misunderstood by profane investigators, were the indirect cause
        of discoveries which the authors had never anticipated...With
        their confused texts, sprinkled with cabalistic expressions, the
        books remain the efficient and genuine cause of the gross
        mistake that we indicate. For, in spite of the warnings, the
        objurations of their authors, students persisted in reading them
        according to the meaning that they hold in ordinary language.
        They do not know that these texts are reserved for initiates,
        and that is essential, in order to understand them, to be in
        possession of their secret key...It is essential first to
        understand what the Ancients meant by the generic and rather
        vague term of spirits...For the alchemists, the spirits are real
        influences, although they are physically almost immaterial or
        imponderable. They act in a mysterious, inexplicable, unknowable
        but efficacious manner on substances submitted to their action
        and prepared to receive them. Lunar radiation is one of these
        hermetic spirits. As for archemists, their conception proves to
        be of a more concrete and substantial nature. Our old chemists
        embraced all bodies under the same heading, simple or complex,
        solid or liquid, having a volatile quality liable to make them
        entirely sublimable. Metals, metalloids, salts, hydrogen
        carbides, etc., bring to archemists their contingency of
        spirits: mercury, arsenic, antimony and some of their compounds:
        sulphur, sal ammoniac, alcohol, ether, vegetable essences,
        etc.". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As concerns "Lunar radiation", it may be
        noteworthy that 17% of moonlight is stimulated emission.
        Magnetism and intent also are effective upon chemical reactions.
        The effect of intent is seen in the Hado Effect”, discovered by
        Dr. Masaru Emoto, whereby the geometry of frozen water is
        modified by thoughts. The work of Charles Littlefield also
        demonstrates this effect. Other useful energetic effects can be
        achieved with a Spectral Catalyst (US Patent # 6,033,531) which
        "duplicates the electromagnetic energy spectral pattern of a
        physical catalyst and when applied to a reaction system
        transfers a quanta of energy in the form of electromagnetic
        energy to control and/or promote the reaction system…” </p>

            Several credible historical accounts describe phenomenal
            healings, rejuvenations, and longevity attributed to the
            Elixir of the Sages. As the following adepts attest, the

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
            use of this Medicine, many great Philosophers themselves,
            after they obtained this wonderful blessing, desiring to
            have perfect Health, have been so bold as to take a certain
            quantity of it, some no more than a quarter of a grain, some
            less, some more, but all that did so with it, instead of
            Health, took Death itself; for there is no small skill to it
            for Medicine, though every fool think if he had it, he could
            cure all diseases, and himself too, and set the Elements at
            unity, which few men have known, neither is there but one
            way to it with safety; if this be not known, more hurt than
            good may be received by it. For the method of Health, it is
            thus: Take the quantity of four grains, I do not mean the
            grains of Wheat, or Barley grains or corns, but four grains
            of Gold weight, and dissolve them in a pint of white or
            Rhenish wine, but in no hot wine, as Sack, &amp;c. put it
            into a great clean Glass, and instantly it will colour all
            the Wine almost as red as it self was, which is the highest
            red in the World: let it stand so, close covered from dust,
            four days, for in respect it is an Oylie substance, it will
            not presently dissolve in Wine; then add to this pint more
            by degrees, until it be not so red, stirring it with a clean
            stick of wood, not of metal, nor Glass, and so continue the
            pouring on of fresh Wine, until it be just of the colour of
            gold, which is a shining yellow. Beware that there be no
            redness in it; for so long as there is any redness in it, it
            is not sufficiently dilated, but will fire the Body, and
            exhaust the Spirits: neither is it sufficiently brought to
            yellow, until the Wine have round about the sides a ring
            like Hair, of a whitish film, which will shew itself plain
            when it is well dissolved, if it stand but four hours quiet.
            As soon as you see this whitish film, then let it run
            through a clean linen Cloth, or Paper, so the white film
            will stay behind and look like a pearl on the paper: and all
            the rest will be yellow like Gold. This is the token of
            truth, that you cannot wrong yourself by this Liquor; and
            without this token, it will be either too weak, or so strong
            that it will fire the Body. Know this to be a rare Secret.
            Of this Golden Water, let the party (of what disease soever
            he be sick of) take each morning a good large spoonful, and
            it shall expel the disease whatsoever it be, by a gentle
            sweat; for it purgeth not, nor vomiteth, nor sweateth so
            much as to make faint, but to corroborate: I say, it
            strengthens the party; and if the disease be of many years
            continuance, or a Chronical disease, it will then be perhaps
            twelve days, otherwise but twenty four hours, or two or
            three days at most. Thus it must be used for all diseases
            internal: But for all external diseases, as Ulcers, Scabs,
            Botches, Scores, Fistulas, <i>Noli me tangere</i>'s,
            &amp;c, the place must be anointed with the Oyl of the Stone
            it self, not dilated in wine; and after this manner it must
            be done nine or ten days, and be it whatsoever it will, it
            will cure all outward and inward diseases. And more than
            this, whosoever carries this Stone about him, no evil Spirit
            can or will stay in the place; nay bringing or giving it to
            a party possessed, it drives away and expels the evil
            Spirits: for it is a Quintessence, and there is no
            corruptible thing in it; and where the Elements are not
            corrupt, no Devil can stay or abide, for he is the
            corruption of the Elements. This Medicine taken nine days as
            aforesaid, and the Temples of the Head anointed with the Oyl
            of the Stone each day in the Morning, it will make a man as
            light as if he could fly, and his Body so aerial it is not
            to be credited, but by him who hath experienced it. These
            most admirable qualities it hath, perfect health it giveth,
            till God calls for the Soul; and perfect knowledge it giveth
            (if the truth be known:) but even this part hath been known
            but to a few that have made it, for it is a Divine, and as
            it were an Angelical Medicine. The white is not to be used
            for any disease but Madness, in the same proportion, and way
            or preparation that the red Stone was...</font></font> </p>

      <p><b><i>Concerning the Ferment</i></b> --- But how are we to
        understand Plato’s remark that he who has once performed this
        work need not repeat it, as his fortune is made forever? The
        words do not means that he who has once prepared the Tincture
        can multiply its quantity indefinitely, just as he who has once
        struck a fire out of a stone can always keep himself provided
        with fire simply by adding fuel to it. The authority of Plato is
        supported by that of Rhasis, who speaks in a similar fashion.
        They should be interpreted, however, not according to the
        letter, but according to the spirit. He who has once succeeded
        in preparing this Medicine need not any more go through the
        experience of his failures and mistakes: he now knows how to
        perform all the processes of our Magistery properly, and,
        therefore, if ever he should need a fresh supply of the
        Medicine, he will be able to provide himself with it without
        much trouble. </p>

            size="-0"><b> ---</b> First, let us say that, according to
            the scared language, the term philosopher’s stone, means the
            stone which bears the sign of the sun. The solar sign is
            characterized by its red coloration, which can vary in
            intensity, as Basil Valentine (1) says, “Its color ranges
            from rosy red to crimson red, or from ruby to pomegranate
            red; as for its weight, it weighs much more than it has
            quantity”. So much for color and density. The Cosmopolite
            (2), whom Louis Figuier believes to be the alchemist known
            under the name of Seton, and others under the name of
            Michael Sendivogius, describes in this passage its
            translucent appearance, its crystalline form, and its
            fusibility: “If one were to find”, he said, “our subject in
            its last state of perfection, made and composed by nature;
            if it were fusible, like wax or butter, and its redness, its
            diaphanous nature or clarity appeared on the outside; it
            would be in truth our blessed stone” Its fusibility is such,
            indeed, that all authors have compared it to that of wax (64
            C); it melts in the flame of a candle”, they repeat; some,
            for this reason, have even given it in the name of great red
            wax (3). With these physical characteristics the stone
            combines some powerful chemical properties --- the power of
            penetration or ingress, absolute fixity, inability to be
            oxidized, which makes it incalcinable, and extreme
            resistance to fire; finally, is irreducibility and its
            perfect indifference to chemical reagents. We hear the same
            from Heinrich Khunrath when he writes in his <i>Ampitheatrum









              Sapientiae Aeternae</i>, “At last, when the Work will have
            passed from ashy color to pure white, then to yellow, you
            will see the philosophers stone, our King raised above the
            dominators, come out of his glassy sepulcher, arise from his
            bed and come onto our worldly scene in is glorified body,
            that is to say, regenerated and more than perfect; in other
            words, the brilliant carbuncle of a greatly shining
            splendor, whose parts, very subtle and very purified by the
            peaceful and harmonious union of the blend are inseparably
            bound and assembled into one; constant and diaphanous as
            crystal, compact and ponderous, easily fusible in fire like
            resin, flowing as wax, and more flowing than quicksilver yet
            without fumes; piercing and penetrating solid and compact
            bodies, as oil penetrates paper; soluble and dilatable in
            any liquid capable of softening it; brittle as glass; taking
            on a saffron color when it is reduced to powder, yet red as
            ruby when it remains in one unadulterated mass (this color
            is the signature of perfect fixation and of fixed
            perfection); coloring and dyeing constantly; fixed in the
            tribulations of all experiences, even when tried by
            devouring sulphur and fiery waters and by the very strong
            persecution of fire; always durable, incalcinable, and like
            the Salamander, permanent and justly judging all things
            (because it is in its own way all in everything), and
            proclaiming: ‘Behold, I shall renew all things’”.</font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around
            1585, the English, the English adventurer Edward Kelley,
            surnamed Talbot, had acquired, from an innkeeper, the
            philosophers’ stone found in the tomb of a bishop who was
            said to have been very rich; it was red and very heavy, but
            without any odor. Meanwhile, Berigard of Pisa says that a
            skillful man gave him a gros (3.82 grams) of a powder whose
            color was similar to that of the red poppy and which had the
            odor of calcined sea salt (4).</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Helvetius (Jean-Frederic Schweitzer) saw the stone, shown to
            him by a foreigner, an Adept, on December 27, 1666, in the
            form of a metal powder the color of sulphur. This powdered
            product came, says Khunrath, from a red mass. In a
            transmutation performed by Seton in July 1602, in front of
            Dr Jacob Zwinger, the powder used was, according to
            Dienheim, “rather heavy, and of a color appearing lemon
            yellow”. A year later, during a second projection at the
            house of a goldsmith, Hans de Kempen in Cologne, August 11,
            1603, the same artist used a red stone.</font></font> <br>
        <font color="#000000"><font size="-0">According to several
            trustworthy witnesses, this stone, directly obtained in
            powder form, could take on a color as bright as that of a
            stone formed in a compact mass. This instance is rather
            rare, but it can happen and is worth mentioning. In this
            way, an Italian Adept, who, in 1658, realized the
            transmutation in front of the Protestant minister, Gros, at
            the house of a goldsmith (named Bureau) from Geneva, used,
            according to those who were in attendance, a red powder.
            Schmeider described the stone that Boetticher obtained from
            Lascaris as a substance having the appearance of a fire-red
            colored glass. Yet, Lascaris had given Dominico Manuel
            (Gaetano) a powder similar to vermilion, the color of
            cinnabar. That of Gustenhover was also very red. As for the
            sample given by Lascaris to Dierback, it was examined under
            Counselor Dippel’s microscope and appeared composed of a
            multitude of small grains or crystals which were red or
            orange; this stone had a power equal to about 600 times the
            unit.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Jean-Baptiste Helmont, relating his experience in 1618 in
            his laboratory at Vilvorde near Brussels, writes, “I have
            seen and touched the philosophers’ stone more than once; its
            color is like powdered saffron, but heavy and shining like
            pulverized glass”. This product, of which one fourth of a
            grain (13.25 milligrams) furnished eight ounces of gold
            (244.72 grams), showed a considerable energy: approximately
            18,470 times the unit..</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
            category of tinctures, i.e., liquids obtained by solutions
            oily metallic extracts, we have the account of Godwin Herman
            Braun from Osnabrueck who achieved the transmutation in
            1701, using a tincture having the appearance of an oil,
            “rather fluid and of a brown color”. The famous chemist
            Henckel (5), according to Valentini, reports the following
            anecdote: “One day a stranger, who had a brown tincture with
            a smell close to hartshorn oil (6), came to a famous
            apothecary of Frankfort-on-Main, named Salwedel; with our
            drops of this tincture he changed a gros of lead into 7-1/2
            grains of gold of 23 carats. This same man gave a few drops
            of this tincture to the apothecary who lodged him and who
            then produced identical gold which he saved in memory of
            that man, with the small bottle in which it was contained
            and where the marks of the tincture can still be seen. I had
            this bottle in my hands, and I can testify about it to the
            world”.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Without disputng the truth of the last two statements, we
            nevertheless refuse to categorize these as transmutations
            brought about by the philosophers’ stone in its special
            state of powder of projection. All the tinctures meet this
            criterion. Their subjection to a particular metal, their
            limited potency, the specific characteristics they exhibit,
            lead us to regard them as simple metallic products,
            extracted from common metals by certain procedures called
            little particulars, which pertain to spagyry rather than to
            alchemy. Furthermore, these tinctures, being metallic, have
            no other action but to penetrate the metals which have been
            used as a basis for their penetration.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us
            leave aside these processes and tinctures. Above all, it is
            important to remember that the philosopher's stone appears
            in the shape of a crystalline, diaphanous body, red in mass,
            yellow after pulverization, dense and very fusible, although
            fixed at any temperature, and which its inner qualities
            render incisive, fiery, penetrating, irreducible and
            incalcinable. In addition, it is soluble in molten glass,
            but instantaneously volatilizes when it is projected onto
            molten metal. Here, in one single object, are gathered
            physiochemical properties which singularly separates it from
            a possible metallic nature and render its origin rather
            nebulous. A little reflection will get us out of our
            difficulty. The masters of the art teach us that the goal of
            their labors is triple. What they seek to realize first is
            the universal Medicine or the actual philosopher's stone.
            Obtained in a saline form, whether multiplied or not, it can
            only be used for the healing of human illnesses,
            preservation of health, and growth of pants. Soluble in any
            alcoholic liquid, its solution takes the name of Aurum
            Potabile (potable gold, although it does not contain the
            least atom of gold) because it assumes a magnificent yellow
            color. Its healing value and the diversity of its use in
            therapeutics makes it a precious auxiliary in the treatment
            of grave and incurable ailments. It has no action on metals,
            except on gold and silver, on which it fixes itself and to
            which it bestows its own properties, which, consequently,
            becomes of no use for transmutation. However, if the maximum
            number of its multiplication is exceeded, it changes form
            and instead of resuming its solid crystalline state when
            cooling down, it remains fluid like quicksilver and
            definitely not coagulable. It then shines in the darkness,
            with a soft, red, phosphorescent light, of a weaker
            brightness than that of a common night light. The universal
            Medicine has become the inextinguishable Light; the light
            giving product of those perpetual lamps, which certain
            authors have mentioned as having been found in some ancient
            sepulchers. Thus radiant and liquid, the philosopher's stone
            is not likely, in our opinion, to be pushed farther;
            desiring to amplify its igneous nature would seem dangerous
            to us; the least that could be feared would be to volatilize
            it and to lose the benefit of a considerable labor. Finally,
            if we ferment the solid, universal Medicine with very pure
            gold or silver, through direct fusion, we obtain the Powder
            of Projection, the third form of the stone. It is a
            translucent mass, red or white according to the chosen
            metal, pulverizable, and appropriate only to metallic
            transmutation. Oriented, determined, and specific to the
            mineral kingdom, it is useless and without action in the two
            other kingdoms.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
            becomes clearly evident from the preceding considerations,
            that the philosophers’ stone or universal Medicine, in spite
            of its undeniable metallic origin, is not uniquely made from
            metallic matter. If it were otherwise, and if one had to
            compose it only with metals, it would remain subjected to
            the conditions ruling mineral nature and it would have no
            need to be fermented to operate transmutation. Furthermore,
            the fundamental axiom which teaches that bodies have no
            action on bodies would be false and paradoxical. Take the
            time and the trouble to experiment, and you will recognize
            that metals have no action on other metals. Be they brought
            to the state of salts or ashes, glasses or colloids, they
            will always retain their nature throughout trials and, in
            the process o reduction, they will separate without losing
            their specific qualities.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only
            the metallic spirits possess the privilege to alter, modify
            and denature metallic bodies. They are the true instigators
            of all the physical metamorphoses that can be observed here.
            But since these tenuous, extremely subtle and volatile
            spirits need a vehicle, an envelope capable of holding them
            back; since this mater must be very pure --- to allow the
            spirit to remain there --- and very fixed so as to prevent
            its volatilization; since it must remain fusible in order to
            promote ingress; since it is essential that it be absolutely
            resistant to reducing agents, we may easily understand that
            this matter cannot be searched for in the sole category of
            metals. That is why Basil Valentine recommends that we take
            the spirit out of the metallic root and Bernard of Trevisan
            forbids the use of metals, minerals and their salts in the
            construction of the body. The reason for it is simple and
            self-explanatory. If the stone were made up of a metallic
            body and a spirit fixed in this body, the later acting on
            the former as if it were of the same species, the whole
            would take the characteristics form of metal. We could, in
            this case, obtain gold or silver or even an unknown metal
            but nothing more. This is what alchemists have always done,
            because they did not know the universality and the nature of
            the agent which they were looking for. But what we ask for,
            along with all the philosophers, is not the union of a
            metallic body with a metallic spirit, but rather the
            condensation, the agglomeration of this spirit into a
            coherent, tenacious and refractory envelope, capable of
            coating it, impregnating all its parts and quaranteeing it
            an efficacious protection. This soul, spirit, or fire
            assembled, concentrated and coagulated in the purest, the
            most resistant and the most perfect of earthly matters, we
            call it our stone. And we can certify that any undertaking
            which does not have this spirit for guide and this matter
            for basis will never lead to the proposed objective.</font></font>

            properties correspond to two states of the same product, the
            first characterizing the red stone, translucent and
            diaphanous, destined for medicine as potable gold, and the
            second, the yellow stone, whose metallic orientation and
            fermentation by means of natural gold have rendered it

            According to the artisan's skill, care, and prudence, the
            philosophical fruit of the tree of knowledge shows a more or
            less important virtue. For it is undeniable that the
            philosopher's stone used for the transmutation of metals is
            never endowed with the same power. Historical projections
            provide us with certain evidence of it. In the operation
            performed by J. B. van Helmont in his laboratory at Vilvorde
            near Brussels in 1618, the stone transformed into gold
            18,740 times its weight in flowing mercury. Richtausen, with
            the help of a product given by Labujardiere, obtained a
            result equivalent to 22,334 times per unit. The projection
            achieved by Seton in 1603 at the house of the merchant Coch
            of Frankfurt-am-Main was acted on a proportion equal to
            1,155 times. In Dippel's report, the powder Lascaris gave to
            Dierbach transmuted approximately 600 times its weight of
            quicksilver. However, another piece given by Lascaris
            displayed more efficiency; in the operation performed at
            Vienna in 1716 in the presence of Counselor Pantzer von
            Hesse, Count Charles-Ernest von Rappach, Count Joseph von
            Wurben and Freudenthal, the brothers Count and Baron von
            Metternich, the ratio reached a power in the vicinity of ten
            thousand. Furthermore, it is not useless to know that the
            maximum production is achieved by the use of mercury, and
            that the same quality of stone gives variable results
            depending upon the nature of the metals used as the basis
            for the projection. The author of Letters of the Cosmopolite
            affirms that if one part of Elixir converts into perfect
            gold a thousand parts of common mercury, it will only
            transform twenty parts of lead, thirty of tin, fifty of
            copper and one hundred of silver. As for the white stone, it
            will, in the same degree of manipulation, only act on
            approximately half of these quantities.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
            while the philosophers spoke little of the variable yield of
            the chrysopeus, on the other hand they displayed more
            prolixity toward the medicinal properties of the Elixir, as
            well as on the surprising effects that it enables one to
            obtain in the plant kingdom.</font></font> </p>

            Ancients". The anonymous author of <i>The Key to the Great
              Work</i>, mentioning Batsdorff's text once more, asserts
            that "this medicine possesses other even more incredible
            virtues. When it is at the white stage of the Elixir, it has
            so much sympathy with women that it can renew their bodies
            and render them as robust and vigorous as they were in their
            youth... For this effect, a bath is first prepared with
            several fragrant herbs with which they should scrub
            themselves clean; then they go into a second bath without
            herbs, but in which 3 grains of the white elixir were
            dissolved in a pint of wine spirit and then poured into the
            water. They remain in this bath for a quarter of an hour;
            after which, without drying themselves, a great fire is to
            be prepared to dry this precious liquor. The ladies then
            feel so strong within themselves, and their body is rendered
            so white that they could not imagine it without having
            experienced it. Our good father Hermes agrees with this
            operation, but, besides these baths, desires that, at the
            same time and for seven consecutive days, this Elixir be
            taken internally; and he adds, if a lady does the same thing
            every year, she will live exempt from all diseases to which
            other ladies are subject without experiencing any
            discomfort."</font></font> </p>

            Huginus á Barma certifies that "the stone fermented with
            gold can be used in medicine in this medicine in this
            manner: one scruple or twenty-four grains are to be taken,
            dissolved according to the art in two ounces of spirit of
            wine, and two to three and up to four drops will be
            prescribed depending on the illness' requirements, in a
            little wine or in some other suitable vehicle". According to
            the ancient authors, all ailments are radically healed on
            one day that lasted for a month; in twelve days if they are
            a year old; in a month if they appeared more than a year
            ago.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
            for this, as for many other things, we must know how to
            guard ourselves against excess imagination; the too
            enthusiastic author of <i>The Key to the Great Work</i>
            sees marvels even in the spirituous dissolution of the
            stone: "Burning golden sparks," claims the writer, "must
            come out of it and an infinity of colors must appear in the
            vase". It is going a little too far in the description of
            phenomena which no philosopher points out. Furthermore, he
            does not acknowledge any limits to the virtues of the
            Elixir: "Leprosy, gout, paralysis, kidney stone, epilepsy,
            dropsy... could not resist the virtue of this medicine." And
            as the healing of these reputedly incurable diseases doesn't
            seem sufficient to him, he eagerly adds to the list even
            more admirable properties. "This medicine causes the deaf to
            hear, the blind to see, the mute to speak, the lame to walk;
            it can totally renew a man by causing his skin to change,
            his teeth, fingernails and white hair to fall out, in stead
            of which new ones will grow, in the color desired". We are
            now drifting into humor and buffoonery.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going
            by what the majority of sages say, the stone can give
            excellent results in the plant kingdom, particularly in what
            concerns fruit trees. In the spring, if we pour a solution
            of the Elixir highly diluted with rain water on the soil
            close to their roots, they can be made resistant to all
            causes of decay and barrenness. They produce even more and
            bear healthy and delicious fruits. Batsdorff goes so far as
            to say that it could be possible, using this process, to
            cultivate exotic vegetables in our latitude. "Delicate
            plants," he writes, "which have difficulty growing in
            climates of an opposite temperament to that which is natural
            to them, by being watered with it, becomes as vigorous as if
            they were in their native soil proper and set by nature."</font></font>

            taking exaggeration and legendary additions into account, it
            remains true nevertheless that the hermetic fruit carries in

            to men of good will on earth...</font></font> </p>

            speculative philosophers, the multiplication however is
            limited for practical considerations. The more the stone
            progresses the more penetrating it becomes and the quicker
            its elaboration; at each stage of augmentation, it only
            requires the eighth of the time required for the preceding
            operation. Generally --- and we are speaking here about the
            long way --- the fourth reiteration requires seldom more
            than two hours; the fifth thus takes a minute and a half,
            while twelve seconds would suffice to achieve the sixth; the
            instantaneousness of such an operation would make it
            unpractical. On the other hand, the intervention of the
            continuously increasing weight and volume would force us to
            keep aside a great part of the resulting product, for want
            of the required corresponding ratio of mercury, the
            preparation of which is time-consuming and fastidious.
            Finally, the stone multiplied to the fifth and sixth degrees
            would demand, given its igneous power, an important mass of
            pure gold to orient it toward the metallic --- otherwise we
            would be liable to lose the whole thing. From any
            standpoint, it is preferable to not push the subtlety too
            far of an agent already gifted with such a considerable
            energy, unless, leaving aside the scope of metallic and
            medical possibilities, you want to possess this Universal
            Mercury, shiny and luminous in darkness, in order to make a
            perpetual lamp. But the passing from the solid to the liquid
            state which must be accomplished here, as it is eminently
            dangerous, can only be attempted by a very learned and most

            Like those of Dampierre, the panel with the three trees
            sculpted in the palace at Bourges bears a motto. On the
            border of the frame decorated with flower-bearing branches,
            the attentive observer indeed discovers isolated letters,
            very cleverly concealed. Their connection composes one of
            the favorite maxims of the great artist that Jacques Couer
            was: .DE.MA.JOIE.DIRE.FAIRE.TAIRE. (About my joy, say it, do
            it, be silent). Now the Adept’s joy resides in his
            occupation. The work which renders this marvel of nature
            more tangible and more familiar to him --- which so many
            ignorant people call chimera --- constitute his best
            distraction and its most noble experiment. In Greek the word
            chara, joy, derived from chairo, to rejoice, to delight in,
            to enjoy, also means to love. The famous philosopher, than
            clearly alludes to the labor of the Work, his dearest task,
            of which moreover so may symbols have come to enhance the
            glamour of his sumptuous house. But what to say, what to
            admit of this unique joy, of this pure and complete
            satisfaction, the intimate cheerfulness of success? The
            least possible, if we do not want to break the oath, to
            attract envy from some, greed from the others, jealousy from
            all, and risk becoming the prey of the powerful. What to do
            then with the result about which the artist, according to
            the rules of our discipline, promises to use in a modest
            fashion? To always use it for the good, to consecrate its
            fruit to the exercise of charity, in conformity to the
            precepts of philosophy and to Christian ethics. Finally what
            should we keep silent about? Absolutely everything which
            concerns the alchemical secret and privilege, the disclosure
            of its process remains forbidden, non-communicable in clear
            language, only permitted when veiled by parables,

            Jacques Couer’s motto, in spite of its conciseness and
            implications, turns out to be in perfect accord with the
            traditional teachings of the eternal wisdom. No philosopher,
            truly worthy of the name, would refuse to subscribe to the
            rules of conduct which it expresses and which can be
            translated in this way:</font></font> </p>

            of a persevering work, by multiplying trials and errors, so
            as to always submit the products of thinking to the control
            of experience. Whoever fears this manual labor, the heat of
            the furnaces, the dust of coal, the danger of unknown

            can make a good plant from a bad one, a young fresh tree

            the key to open heaven and earth, that you may enter into
            the highest firmament of heaven, into the center of the
            earth, and into the depths of the ocean. You can see through
            every mountain, valley, leaf, grass, animal, man, etc, and
            in short through everything, as though you were looking
            through a piece of glass. You can learn the characteristics
            of everything, you will master heaven and earth, all spirits
            will be obedient to you, they will have to serve you and do
            your will. You can also come to know everything, both
            present and future (as much as God permits), which means
            that you can create the world and receive the power of the
            same. However this may seem, it is knowable, for it is magic
            and supernatural. As I have already said, when you are
            granted the success of attaining the completion of the
            natural, then you may go on to experience the supernatural.
            Thus you now possess what I have taught you, and,
            considering how poorly you have dealt with it before, guard
            yourself against this, and be warned.</font></font> </p>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            1917 we succeeded in making the White Stone of the
            Philosophers. It looked like soft, white marble, and its
            effect upon the body was startling. We dared not try it on
            ourselves at first, but there was a third member of our
            family, a beautiful Angora cat of which we were very fond...
            It survived the first dose, and we repeated it on the two
            following days, with the cat becoming more frisky than
            usual. After that we tried it ourselves, each taking a dose
            at the same moment so we would excarnate together if it
            should prove fatal. But it proved beneficial and energized
            our bodies.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Shortly after that event, the wife of a prominent local
            physician died; and the doctor, knowing of our experiments
            and that the books claimed that such a stone, if used within
            a reasonable time, would raise the dead, asked us to
            experiment on the body of his wife. Half an hour had elapsed
            since her death and her body was growing cold. A dose of the
            dissolved White Stone was put into the mouth of the corpse
            without perceptible result. Fifteen minutes afterward a
            second dose was administered and the heart commenced to
            pulsate weakly. Fifteen minutes later a third dose was given
            and soon the woman opened her eyes. In the course of a few
            weeks, the patient became convalescent, after which she
            lived seven years.</font></font> </p>

            when it is above the horizon where you are, and step aside
            in a garden, and you take a little pure rainwater, as you
            did in the first operation, and you drop some of the white
            wine in it, just as you did with the red --- immediately a
            vapor will rise in a peculiar way toward the circle of the
            moon. If you do this at every moon in due course, there is
            no philosopher in the horizon where you are living and who
            has knowledge of the Stone as well as its use, who does not
            also go out at the same time, seeking in the East and West,
            the North and South. When he finds such an appearance (as he
            will soon see), he will now that this is done by an artist,
            or someone else, who would like to get acquainted with those
            who know just this art, and he will answer you in the same
            manner as you have done. In this way you will recognize
            those who know the use of the Stone.</font></font> </p>

            under your head, and set your imagination on him who you
            desire to recognize, and go to sleep in this way. When you
            awaken, you will immediately remember the face of the
            person, his name and the place where he stays. If you do not
            wish to go to him, he will come to you; for he will perhaps
            think that you do not know this secret. The cause of this

            used for transmutation, a pound of it must be projected on a
            thousand pounds of melted Sol. Then, at length, will a
            Medicine have been prepared for transmuting the leprous
            moisture of the metals. This work is a wonderful one in the
            light of Nature, namely, that by the magistery, or the
            operation of the Spagyrist, a metal, which formerly existed,
            should perish, and another be produced. This fact has
            rendered the same Aristotle, with his ill-founded
            philosophy, fatuous... These things, and more like them, are
            known to simple men rather than to sophists, namely, those
            which turn one appearance of a metal into another. And these
            things, moreover, through the remarkable contempt of the
            ignorant, and partly, too, on account of the just envy of
            the artificers, remain almost hidden...</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
            though the old artists were very desirous of this arcanum,
            and sought it with the greatest diligence, nevertheless,
            very few could bring it by means of a perfect preparation to
            its end. For the transmutation of an inferior metal into a
            superior one brings with it many difficulties and obstacles,
            as the change of Jove into Luna, or Venus into Sol. Perhaps
            on account of their sins God willed that the Magnalia of
            Nature should be hidden from many men. For sometimes, when
            this Tincture has been prepared by artists, and they were
            not able to reduce their projections to work its effects, it
            happened that, by their carelessness and bad guardianship,
            this was eaten up by fowls, whose feathers thereupon fell
            off, and, as I myself have seen, grew again. In this way
            transmutation, through its abuse from the carelessness of
            the artists, came into Medicine and Alchemy. For when they
            were unable to use the Tincture according to their desire,
            they converted the same to the renovation of men...</font></font>

                Chapter VII. Concerning the Renovation of Men</b></font></font></i><font
          color="#000000"><font size="-0"> --- Some of the first and
            primitive philosophers of Egypt have lived by means of this
            Tincture for a hundred and fifty years. The life of many,
            too, has been extended and prolonged to several centuries,
            as is most clearly shown in different histories, though it
            scarcely seems credible to any one. For its power is so
            remarkable that it extends the life of the body beyond what
            is possible to its congenital nature, and keeps it so firmly
            in that condition that it lives on in safety from all
            infirmities. And although, indeed, the body at length comes
            to old age, nevertheless, it still appears as though it were
            established in its primal youth.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,
            then, the Tincture of the Philosophers is a Universal
            Medicine, and consumes all diseases, by whatsoever name they
            are called, just like an invisible fire. The dose is very
            small, but its effect is most powerful. By means thereof, I
            have cured the leprosy, venereal disease, dropsy, the
            falling sickness, colic, scab, and similar afflictions; also
            lupus, cancer, noli me tangere, fistulas, and the whole race
            of internal diseases, more surely than one could believe...</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,
            Sophist, look at Theophrastus Paracelsus. How can your
            Apollo, Machaon, and Hippocrates stand against me? This is
            the Catholicum of the Philosophers, by which all these
            philosophers have attained long life for resisting diseases,
            and they have attained this end entirely and most
            effectually, and so, according to their judgment, they named
            it the Tincture of the Philosophers. For what can there be
            in the whole range of medicine greater than such purgation
            of the body, by means whereof all superfluity is radically
            removed from it and transmuted? For when seed is once made
            sound all else is perfected. What avails the ill-founded
            purgation of the sophists since it removes nothing as it
            ought? This, therefore, is the most excellent foundation of
            a true physician, the regeneration of the nature, and the
            restoration of youth. After this, the new essence itself
            drives out all that is opposed to it. To effect this
            regeneration, the powers and virtues of the Tincture of the
            Philosophers were miraculously discovered, and up to this
            time have been used in secret and kept concealed by true
            Spagyrists.</font></font> </p>

            are doomed, like Cain, to wander over the earth homeless and
            friendless. Not for us are the soothing influences of

            only by changing my dress and my name, by shaving off my
            beard and putting on a wig, that I was enabled to save my
            life, and escape from the hands of those wicked men. And
            even when our lives are not threatened, it is not pleasant
            to find ourselves, wherever we go, the central object of
            human greed... I know of several persons who were strangled
            in their beds, simply because they were suspected of
            possessing this secret, though, in reality, they knew no
            more about it than their murderers; it was enough for some
            desperate ruffians, that a mere whisper of suspicion had
            been breathed against their victims. Men are so eager to
            have this Medicine that your very caution will arouse their
            suspicions, and endanger your safety. Again, if you desire
            to sell any large quantity of your gold and silver, you will
            be unable to do so without imminent risk of discovery. The
            very fact that someone has a great mass of bullion for sale
            would in most places excite suspicion. This feeling will be
            strengthened when people test the quality of our gold; for
            it is much finer and purer than any of the gold which is
            brought from Barbary, or from the Guinea Coast; and our
            silver is better even than that which is conveyed home by
            the Spanish silver fleet... I remember once going, in the
            disguise of a foreign merchant, to a goldsmith's shop, and
            offering him 600 pounds worth of our pure silver for sale.
            He subjected it to the usual tests, and then said: "This
            silver is artificially prepared." When I asked why he
            thought so, his answer was: "I am not a novice in my
            profession, and know very well the exact quality of the
            silver which is brought from the different mines." When I
            heard these words I took myself away with great secrecy and
            dispatch, leaving the silver in the hands of the goldsmith.
            On this account, and by reason of the many and great
            difficulties which beset us, the possessors of this Stone,
            on every side, we do elect to remain hidden, and will
            communicate the Art to those who are worthily covetous of
            our secrets, and then mark what public good will befall...</font></font>

            possess wealth sufficient to buy the whole world --- but as
            yet I may not use it on account of the craft and cruelty of
            wicked men. It is not from jealousy that I conceal as much
            as I do: God knows I am weary of this lonely, wandering
            life, shut out from the bonds of friendship, and almost from
            the face of God. I do not worship the golden calf, before
            which our Israelites bow low to the ground; let it be ground
            into powder like the brazen serpent. I hope that in a few
            years gold (not as given by God, but as abused by man) will
            be so common that those who are now so mad after it, shall
            contemptuously spurn aside this bulwark of the Antichrist.
            Then will the day of our deliverance be at hand when the
            streets of the new Jerusalem are paved with gold, and its
            gates are made of great diamonds. The day is at hand when,
            by means of this my book, gold will have become as common as
            dirt; when we Sages shall find rest for the soles of our
            feet, and render fervent thanks to God. My heart conceives
            unspeakable things, and is enlarged for the good of the
            Israel of God. These words I utter forth with a herald's
            clarion tones. My book is the precursor of Elias, designed
            to prepare the Royal way of the master; and would to God
            that by its means all men might become adepts in our Art ---
            for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its
            value, and we would prize it only for its scientific
            teaching. Virtue would be loved for its own sake. I am
            familiar with many possessors of this Art who regard silence
            as the great point of honor. But I have been enabled by God
            to take a different view of the matter; and I firmly believe
            that I can best serve the Israel of God, and put my talent
            out at usury, by making this secret knowledge the common
            property of the whole world. Hence I have not conferred with
            flesh and blood, nor attempted to obtain the consent of my
            brother Sages. If the matter succeeds according to my desire
            and prayer, they will all rejoice that I have published this
            book.</font></font> </p>

      <p>An Exposition upon the Preface of Sir George Ripley --- This
        Mercury thus renovate or new born, may by the Philosopher be
        diversly handled; for he may take his work from the Fire, and
        circulate and cohobate this Mercury by a peculiar operation,
        which partly Mechanical, till he have a most admirable pure
        subtile Spirit, in which he may dissolve Pearls and all Gems,
        and multiply them or his Red Stone, before it be united with a
        metal in projection for the making of Aurum Potabile. And in
        this Mercury thus circulated, is doubtless the Mystery of the
        never-fading Light, which I have actually seen, but yet not
        practically made. In a word, every one who hath this exuberate
        Mercury, hath indeed at command the subject of wonders, which he
        may imploy himself many ways in both admirably and pleasantly.
        And certainly he that hath this, needs no information from
        another; himself now standing in the Centre, he may easily view
        the Circumference, and then operation will be, next to the
        Spirit of God, his best Guide. Know then, that if thou be a Son
        of Art, when thou art once arrived hither, thou are so far from
        being at the end of thy search, (unless thou make Gold to be thy
        final object, and so thou shalt never come hither) that thou art
        but now come into the Mystical School of the hidden wonders of
        God, in which thou mayst every day see new Miracles, if thou be
        studious and desirous of knowledge, which all Adepti are; they
        prize skill before any earthly thing, and therefore refuse
        Honour and Pomp, and retire only to the behoulding of God and
        his Works, in this admirable Looking-glass of the most hidden
        Mysteries of Nature. </p>

              Rosicrucian Society</i></font></b><a name="18SEN"></a> </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XXXVII </b>--- The Use of the Practice
        is this. First, as to a medicine for animals, dissolve one grain
        of the simple Stone in 100 grains of that mercury wherewith the
        Stone is made, or in any other liquor or convenient vehicle
        according to the present condition of the disease, and the
        temperament of the patient, giving a due potion of such liquors
        with one grain of dissolved Stone. But if the stone has been
        once multiplied, then one grain of it must be dissolved in a
        thousand grains of such a convenient liquor; if twice
        multiplied, in ten thousand grains of liquor, and so on. <br>
        Second, as to the transmutation of metals, take one part of the
        simple Stone and ten parts of the said Mercury, not of the
        vulgar; or of the once multiplied Stone one part, and one
        hundred parts of the same Mercury, or lastly one part of twice
        multiplied Stone and a thousand part of the said Mercury. Set
        them to dry, first in a gentle fire, then stronger and stronger
        till it acquires the consistency of stone. And such imbibitions
        and dessications repeat until one part of the Stone converts ten
        parts of common mercury, twenty of lead, thirty of tin, fifty of
        copper, and lastly one hundred of silver, into perfect gold if
        the Stone be for gold. But half of the part, or thereabouts, of
        the said proportions of those metals, if the Stone be for
        silver. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you should want a sufficient quantity
        of the aforesaid Mercury, then you can degrade the Stone with
        common Mercury in the following manner. Project one part of this
        simple or multiplied Stone upon ten parts of heated common
        mercury, and you shall have a powder of the same nature as the
        Stone, but of a lesser virtue and efficacy. All of this powder
        project again upon one hundred parts of the same common mercury,
        and again project this powder upon one thousand part of the same
        common mercury. And if then the powder grows moist, dry it with
        fire, and it will remain a powder, which lastly you can project
        upon the aforesaid metals, keeping the same proportion. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is now the universal and most exact
        Theory and Practice of the Stone… </p>
