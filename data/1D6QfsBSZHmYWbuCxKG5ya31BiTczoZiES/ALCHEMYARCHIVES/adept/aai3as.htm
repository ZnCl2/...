      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The <i>Ars Brevis</i></b> revealed by
        Myriam and other alchemists is most intriguing and appealing.
        Yet, many aspiring alchemists have died in vain due to their
        carelessness, ignorance, and haste in this operation, which
        apparently involves <i>Arsenic</i>. There is no margin for
        error: arsenic is very toxic. A single bubble of arsine (the
        hydride gas) can be fatal. It behooves you to be familiar with
        inorganic chemistry and literature such as J.W. Mellor's <i>Comprehensive






          Treatise on Inorganic &amp; Theoretical Chemistry</i> (IX),<i>
          Chemical Abstracts, Merck Index, etc.,</i> particularly as
        concerns arsenic trioxide, arsenious acid hemidydrate and the
        trichloride. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Arsenic</i> is the alchemical child of
        Gur, a mysterious terrestrial gel that is extremely rare today,
        insofar as very few people are aware of its existence; fewer
        still search for it, and find it. In ancient times, Gur often
        was found in mines (especially in lead mines), but the modern
        practice of explosive blasting prevents its manifestation. It
        has been called Gur only in a few books. Nature can and will
        make a gift of Gur to her Lovers, but you must be prepared to
        collect and seal it in a clean glass vessel, and use it
        immediately (add gold and heat). Sendivogius (or, Seton, if you
        prefer), states in <i>The New Chemical Light:</i> "In the
        winter this unctuous vapor is congealed by the frost". This is
        true, as I have found it thus (presented to me by the Earth).
        Otherwise, Gur also fits the description given by Dioscorides
        for "<i>chalcanthon</i>", and by Pliny for "<i>atramentum
          sutorium</i>" (vitriol, ferrous sulfate), from which Sulfur
        Trioxide (the Philosophical Mercury of Albertus Magnus) can be
        prepared by dry distillation, if you choose to explore in that
        direction. <br>

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impregnati</i>on ---</b> We must know
        that when the Earth is a little made white, there it is termed
        Pregnation, because then the Earth is Impregnated. For when the
        Earth is joined with an imperfect body, it is called Our Earth,
        because the Earth is the Mother of all the elements, and this is
        that which they term [unidentified alchemical symbol], when the
        Earth begins to retain with it somewhat of <i>Arsenic</i>, or
        Our Salt, or Argent vive, for then it is called a Conception,
        because the male acts towards the female, because the Mystery of
        the Philosophers is nothing else but the male and female and
        their conjunction. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water coming to them, that is <i>Arsenic</i>
        or Our Salt, which increases much in the Earth and is augmented
        and comes out when the Earth is dealbated, then it is called a
        Pregnation, because the Earth having conceived goes away

        to be condemned and disposed as faeces and dross. Make,
        therefore, a difference between the clear and bright thereof,
        because when it is most white and ascends like snow then it will
        be accomplished. Gather it, therefore, warily that it fly not
        away in fume, because it is a good thing to be sought for, a
        white foliated earth, congealing that which is to be congealed
        and cleansing that which is to be cleansed, and purifying <i>Arsenic</i>
        and white Sulphur, of which Aristotle says that it is the best
        thing the Alchemists can take, that of it they may make
        Silver... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior</i></b> --- Sulfur and <i>Arsenic</i>
        are not the true medicine of this magistery, because they
        neither accomplish nor effect fully, as hath been sufficiently
        known of all the lesser minerals… </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Salt of the Philosophers</i>
          ---</b> And when it was white they called it <i>Arsenic</i>,
        and by the name of every white thing, and also Virgin’s Milk,
        and when it was red they called it Sulfur, and Jacinth, and by
        the name of every red thing… </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of the Double Difference of Minerals</i>
          --- </b>But mineral bodies are specially distinguished into
        two parts. That is to say, into a metallic part and a mineral
        part. Into a metallic part, that is, into metals which draw
        their original from Mercury, and into a mineral part which does
        not come from Mercury. An example from metals - Sol, Luna,
        Jupiter, and Mars has its mixture of gold and silver. An example
        from minerals --- Salts, Inks, Alums, <i>Arsenic, Auripigment</i>.
        All metals are ductile and liquefiable which draw their original
        from Mercury, because the matter of them, out of a watery
        substance mixed with an earthy substance, by a strong commixtion
        that the one cannot be separated from the other, wherefore that
        watery substance is congealed with cold more after the action of
        heat and therefore they will be more fabrile or ductile, and the
        water only is not congealed but only with the earthly dryness
        which alters the wateryness, when as there is no unctuous
        moisture in them, because the congealing of them is of earthly
        dryness. Therefore they are not easily dissolved unless by the
        vehement action of the heat in them, according to which they are
        most easily commixt. But there are lesser and and middle
        minerals which take not their original from Mercury, and of
        these are Salts which easily melt in moisture, as Alum, simple
        Salt, Salt Armonick, stony Salt and all kinds of salts. And
        surely they have virtue in them. Neither do they easily melt
        with moisture only, as <i>Auripigmentum, Arsenic</i> and
        Sulphur, when as the wateryness of sulphurous bodies is mixed
        with slimy earth, by strong commixtion, with the fervency of
        heat, until they be made virtuous and then they are coagulated
        of cold. </p>

        and sensible things, where they have found out no truth, but

        The philosophers have ordered that quicksilver should be taken
        out of cambar, and albeit they have spoken truly, yet in these
        words there is a little ambiguity, the obscurity of which I will
        remove. See then that the quicksilver is sublimed in
        tabernacles, and extract the same from Cambar, but there is
        another Cambar in sulphur which Belus hath demonstrated to you,
        for out of sulphur mixed with sulphur, many works proceed. When
        the same has been sublimed, there proceeds from the Cambar that
        quicksilver which is called Ethelia, <i>Orpiment</i>, Zendrio,
        or Sanderich, Ebsemich, Magnesia, Kuhul or Chuhul, and many
        other names... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52nd Dictum</i></b> <b>---</b> This
        is the quicksilver which is indeed extracted from all things,
        out of which all things are produced, which also is pure water
        that destroys the shade of copper. And know ye that this
        quicksilver, when it is whitened, becomes a sulphur which
        contains sulphur, and is a venom that has a brilliance like
        marble; this the envious call Ethelia, orpiment and sandarac,
        out of which a tincture and a pure spirit ascends with a mild
        fire, and the whole flower is sublimated, which flower becomes
        wholly quicksilver... </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Book of El-Habib</i> says that the
        virtue of eternal water is that of a spiritual blood. It is
        identified with aeriform water, azure water, and water of
        sulphur. It is also primal sulphur. When boiled, it transforms
        the male (<i>arsenic</i>) into silver, and afterwards into gold.
        It is also said that copper is water of silver, which, after
        preparation, becomes eternal water... [<i>10th Dictum</i>,
        footnote by Arthur E. Waite] </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses</i>: The quicksilver out of
        cinnabar (<i>argentum vivum cambar</i>)... is the Magnesia,
        while the quicksilver of the <i>auripigmentum </i>or <i>orpiment</i>...







        is the Sulphur which ascends from this mixed compound material.
        You must, therefore mix that thick thing with the Fiery Venom,
        and let it putrefy, and diligently pound it until a spirit is
        produced which is hidden in that other spirit; then it will
        become a tincture for everything that you wish. [Julian Ruska: <i>Turba

        Sulphurs, or Sulphur-vive, or <i>Auripigment</i>, or Citrine <i>Arsenicum</i>,

        commixtion of both, neither can we: from these therefore, as
        from the foresaid Argent-vive and Sulphur in their nature we are
        excused. Finally, if we should choose them, we should mix
        everything as it is, according to a due proportion, which no man
        knows, and afterward decoct it to coagulation, into a solid
        lump: and therefore we are excused from receiving both of them
        in their proper nature: to wit, Argent-vive and Sulphur, seeing
        we know not their proportion, and that we may meet with bodies,

        as much as you like. Powder each finely by itself, and mix the
        powders. Beware of the dust. </p>
      <p>Put the mixture in a globe glass with a long neck. Place your
        glass deeply buried in the sand, so that the best part of the
        globe is under the sand, but the whole neck remains free. Your
        furnace must stand under a chimney. Then light your fire which
        increase gradually. After the humidity has evaporated, put a bit
        of soft clay upon the opening of the neck of the glass and press
        it in gently. </p>
      <p>Increase your fire, until the sand and glass grow so intensely
        hot, that the powders melt together in the globe. </p>
      <p>When you see this let the substance continue melting until the
        whole has become of a fine deep red fluid massa. At the later

      <p>When you have obtained the red fluid mass in fusion, take the
        fire out immediately, that the glass may cool gradually. </p>
      <p>The next day, break the glass and you will find a fine red
        transparent ruby glass, called Lapis de Tribus because it
        consists of antimony, <i>arsenic</i>, and sulphur. </p>
      <p>Note – Of you admit the air into the neck of the glass, the
        mixture takes fire, and you run great risk of your life;
        therefore be careful. It is done in 4 hours time. This glass is
        very volatile. </p>
      <p>(I have given you some of it in a red powder, which, if you
        melt, it becomes a red glass again.) </p>
      <p>One W. Cornelius de Winter from Amsterdam who was in London
        about the year 1775 comunicated this and what to do with it to
        W. Lantz. </p>
      <p>Cornelius de Winter working the process of Myriam prophetissa,
        not as she told her process to Aros, King of Egypt, but in the
        following manner, had attained a tinging powder upon silver, as
        he told W. Lentz, and recommended this to him, until he should
        fid something of greater consequence, and W. Lentz gave it to
        me. I have never tried it. </p>
      <p>The Process of Cornelius de Winter with te foregoing Lapis de
        Tribus for the Short Way. </p>
      <p>Take 3iv of Lapis de Tribus in powder and 3J of fine gold in
        leaves. Mix these in a mortar by rubbing. Let it melt together
        in a covered crucible and suffer no coals to drop in. When the
        crucible begins to grow red hot, the mixture melts and at last
        inflamed, and the Lapis de Tribus fumes away and evaporates.
        When you find the Lapis evaporated, take the crucible out and
        let it cool, but do not breathe the poisonous fumes. </p>
      <p>Take the gold calx out. Weigh it and mix it anew with 4 parts
        of fresh powdered Lapid de Tribus, by rubbing it in a glass. Put
        the mixture into a new crucible. Melt again and keep it in the
        fire, until the Lapis de Tribus is again evaporated. Repeat the
        same operation, with 4 parts of fresh Lapis and your gold calx
        is well opened for a further operation. </p>
      <p>Cornelius de Winter said to W. Lentz, "You may proceed in this
        manner with silver, copper, or iron, and open and volatilize
        them by means o the Lapis de Tribus, sooner than the gold, and
        not that one single melting of four parts of the lapis to open
        part of fine silver in leaves, or of a Crocus Martis, or
        Veneris, opens and greatly volatilizes silver, iron or copper in
        one single operation. You are also to note that you fire must
        not be excited by the blast. It must not be a melting, but only
        a calcining fire. Otherwise your volatilized metals fly out of
        the crucible, and you keep the empty nest". </p>
      <p>The Lapis de Tribus has a power to volatilize all metals, gold
        and silver not excepted, either by the first, second or third
        operation, according to their natural volatility or fixity, and
        highly subtilizes them and reduces them into a mercurial
        principle, which mercurialized metals can be employed in labors
        of great consequence, as experience will teach you. I tell you
        the truth, but beware of the mercurial fumes. </p>
      <p>"I have made a Tincture in Via Sicca from this foundation, more
        than once at Amsterdam, and although it acts only on a few parts
        of silver, yet it is very profitable, as it can be accomplished
        very well in 3 or 4 days’ time, but this is not the brass
        founder’s work, by any means", said de Winter. </p>
      <p>Take of the whitest and clearest river pebbles you can get, a
        pound or more, and powder them finely in a clean iron mortar,
        and sift your powder perfectly fine. </p>
      <p>Of this fine pebble powder, take 3/4 lb, and good yellow
        litharge powdered and sifted, one lb. Mix the two powders. Put
        them into a new crucible covered, and melt the mixture to a
        glass in the wind furnace. When done take the crucible out and
        let it cool. When cold, break the crucible and powder your glass
        and sift it. </p>
      <p>Now take one part of Lapis de Tribus in powder and mix it with
        4 parts of the pebble glass by rubbing them well together in a
        glass mortar. Melt these substances in a new crucible for 5 or 6
        hours, so as to keep the matter in constant fusion. Then take
        the crucible out, break it, and when cold, poweder it, and your
        glass will look tinged with yellow or orange. Weigh it, and mix
        it again, 4 parts of this tinged glass with one part of fresh de
        Tribus. Melt again, in a new crucible constantly covered, for 5
        or 6 hours. You can very well accomplish 2 meltings in a day.
        Repeat this a third time, and your obtained glass ought to be of
        a fine orange colour. This is already a kind of Tincture, which
        if you melt it with silver, it enriches the silver with atoms of
        fine gold, and if you separates such silver with aqua fortis,
        the black calx, which falls, when washed, dried, and melted with
        borax, proves to be fine gold of 24 carats, but this is not all.
      </p>
      <p>Take your orange coloured opaque glass, weigh it, and powder
        and sift it. Take of this 4 parts, say drachms, in proportion,
        as you have opened gold, which you have prepared at first, one
        part or drachm of fresh Lapis de Tribus, and one 3 of your
        opened mercurialized gold, and mix the whole diligently in a
        porphyry or glass mortar. You must rub full 2 hours, and do not
        breathe the dust. Melt this composition in a new covered
        crucible during 6 hours continual fusion, yet without any blast
        or violence, as fusion is enough. </p>
      <p>When the time is past, take out the pot and let it cool. Break
        the crucible and separate the glass, which does now look of a
        deeper red, like a new brick. </p>
      <p>Powder and weigh this glass. Take thereof 4 parts, and add one
        part of fresh lapis de Tribus in powder. Mix the two powders
        diligently and melt them again in a new covered crucible for 6
        hours time, keeping the matter in constant fusion. When cold,
        you will find your glass deeper in colour than before. </p>
      <p>Repeat this fusion a third time (which from the beginning, is
        now the sixth melting, adding to 4 parts of this red glass, one
        part of fresh Lapis de Tribus and proceed carefully, as you did
        before, but Note: --- </p>
      <p>1. If any coals fall into the pot, the operation is spoiled,
        which has happened to me in the beginning: </p>
      <p>2. By the repeated fusions and fixations by the violent way,
        adding each time a 1/5 part of fresh Lapis de Tribus, i.e., one
        part of the lapis to 4 parts of the fixed glass, your tinged
        glass becomes more and more penetrating, more fusible and more
        fixed. </p>
      <p>I durst not go beyond 6 or 7 fusions, as the glass does at last
        run through the pores of the red hot crucible. In this manner I
        once lost all my treasure. </p>
      <p>6 or 7 fusions may be safely done. </p>
      <p>This red glass is a genuine Tincture upon fine silver. After 6
        fusions, it tinges sometimes 10, sometimes 12, sometimes 20
        parts of silver in fusion into fine gold of 24 carats. I could
        never make it twice alike, the reason of which I cannot
        penetrate. It is profitable enough, but no so profitable, as
        Myriam said to King Aros. At least I could never find it so. </p>

        and most practical method to use and to readily show that all of
        his processes were different, even though quite similar to one
        another… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the principle preparation of one
        or another of the ingredients from the universal material had
        already been carried out, as had become clearly evident from the
        above-mentioned work of Kunkel, page 580, which reads, "The
        white arsenic powder is no longer prepared for the Elector of

        sulfur, and other material which all refer to the prime
        universal material mentioned now and then in his process. He who
        knows how to make this same white material can make his process
        successful, while others cannot. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it must be a general rule in this
        work, as stated by Arnold de Villa, and again on page 66, that
        only a few minerals, along with white <i>arsenic</i> and
        burning sulphur, which were to be made at the same time, are
        needed, as Geber had said: "There is only one mineral, one
        medicine, one digestion; and in this our entire work consists,
        to which we add nothing unfamiliar, or take anything away,
        without removing excess impurities therefrom in the process”. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Chief Difficulties of Alchemy: Tenth
            Cause of Difficulty</i></b> --- The Sages appear to vary
        quite as much in their descriptions of the substance from which
        this Stone is elaborated. In order to mislead the ignorant and
        the foolish, some name <i>arsenic</i>, some sulphur, some
        quicksilver, some blood, some eggs, some hair, some dung, etc.,
        etc. In reality, there is only one substance of our Stone;
        nothing else upon earth contains it; it is that which is most
        like gold, and from which gold itself is generated, viz., pure
        quicksilver, that is, not mixed with anything else, as we shall
        shew further on. The substance of Alchemy --- though called by a
        perplexing variety of names --- is the substance of Nature, and
        the first substance of metals, from which Nature herself evolves
        them. Were it otherwise, it would be impossible for Art to
        imitate Nature. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Excellent Introduction to the Art
            of Alchemy: Chapter I. The Matter of the Philosopher’s Stone</i></b>
        --- Note: Hence, fixed sulphur retards fusion and liquefaction
        in metals, and entirely prevents it where its quantity exceeds
        that of the quicksilver. The latter is the case in iron, and the
        said metal is, therefore, not fusible. The fact we are taught by
        experience, for when we desire to make fixed sulphur, we must
        calcine it, and that which is calcined is not susceptible of
        fusion. But sulphur which is not fixed accelerates fusion, as we
        see in the case of <i>arsenic</i>, which is of the nature of
        sulphur, and brings about the fusion of red-hot iron. That it is
        the sulphur which prevents fusion, we see from the fact that
        when miners smelt ore, there ascends a sulphureous vapour before
        fusion takes place, and if we collect this substance in a
        vessel, it is found to resemble <i>orpiment</i>. But both its
        smell and its properties shew that it consists largely of
        sulphur… <br>
        Though in his book on <i>The Coagulation of Mercury by
          Precipitation</i> he [Geber] says that this medicine is
        elicited from metallic bodies with their sulphur and <i>arsenic</i>,
        he really means the same thing, but he expresses himself
        somewhat obscurely... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the Ferment</i></b> --- If
        the Mercury were coagulated by some foreign (non-metallic)
        substance, it would not be of the slightest use, since in Nature
        only homogeneous things will combine. The coagulation by means
        of <i>arsenic</i> and common sulphur, though they are mineral
        substances, tends only to corruption. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Epistle of Bonus of Ferrara</i></b>
        --- Know, then, that our <i>arsenic</i> or <i>auripigment</i>
        is composed by Nature of sulphur and quicksilver, as it is found
        in its original natural state. When <i>arsenic</i> is sublimed,
        it often happens that there comes out of it quicksilver in small
        globules like grains of millet, as every experimental chemist
        will tell you. This quicksilver is identical with ordinary
        quicksilver, which may be seen from the fact that it alone of
        all metallic substances will mingle with quicksilver, while the
        quicksilver retains all its own peculiar properties and
        qualities. Hence we conclude that in the composition of <i>arsenic</i>
        there is quicksilver. In the same way, we call sulphur the
        tincture of redness properly and by virtue of its own nature;
        quicksilver is the white tincture, as all Sages tell us. But if
        we project <i>arsenic</i> or <i>realgar</i> upon liquid
        copper, it will tinge that metal with a white colour like the
        whiteness of the Moon; this colour shews the presence of
        quicksilver. In all properly purified metals we find the nature
        of quicksilver rather than of sulphur; for sulphur exists in
        quicksilver in an occult manner. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common sulphur is specifically different
        from <i>arsenic</i>, but belongs to the same genus. Similarly,
        all sulphur, and everything that belongs to the same species
        with sulphur, has the property of coagulating quicksilver; and
        sometimes succeeds in imparting to it a red colour, and
        sometimes fails to do so. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We said above that when <i>arsenic</i> is
        sublimed it gives out globules of quicksilver like grains of
        millet, which is identical with ordinary quicksilver. For this
        reason the Sages have endeavored, by a congruous digestion, to
        coagulate the same quicksilver with itself, even as gold is
        coagulated by its intrinsic power. <i>Arsenic</i>, says Geber,
        has the two metallic first principles, sulphur and quicksilver,
        combined, and by their means may itself be designated as the
        first principle of Nature, in virtue of their properties and
        qualities. In the same book he says that the fetid spirit and
        living water, which is also called dry water, are the first
        principles of Nature. There can be no transition from the
        softness of quicksilver to the hardness of metals, except in
        some intermediate substance. Hence neither quicksilver by
        itself, nor sulphur by itself, is the first principle of Nature,
        but some intermediate matter which contains both. The
        quicksilver extracted from sulphur and <i>arsenic</i> is,
        however, more proximately the substance of our Medicine than the
        same sulphur and <i>arsenic</i> when they remain as they are. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>arsenic</i> to which Geber refers as
        the third principle of Nature in the generation of metals is a
        compound of quicksilver and sulphur, and possesses the virtue
        and power of both. It cannot be properly called sulphur, nor yet
        quicksilver, and thus it is true that there are only two
        principles of Nature. Nor is this <i>arsenic</i>, which has
        quicksilver for its matter and sulphur for its active potency,
        in any sense a thing superfluous, but is a sufficing principle
        of nature in the generation of metals. Hence the quicksilver of
        which we speak is not common quicksilver, nor is our sulphur
        common sulphur; but there is in our quicksilver an occult
        homogeneous sulphur, and it is by means of this inward sulphur
        that all our changes are accomplished. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, do not suppose that any compound
        but the one I have mentioned is the right substance of our Art,
        and forebear to spend your labour I vain upon magnesia,
        marchasite, tutia, antimony, or any other heterogeneous
        material. Our sulphur is the vital agent which digests and
        perfects our quicksilver; but the sulphur of marchasite, for
        instance (as Geber tells us), is only degrading and combustive;
        in the separation thereof the quicksilver of marchasite is left
        dead at the bottom of the vessel, and must afterwards be
        sublimed by fire. Again, we do not find in the composition of
        gold, or of any other metals, anything that suggests or
        resembles marchasite. Though <i>arsenic</i> and marchasite are
        generated from nearly the same elements, their diversity of form
        has combined and developed those elements in a widely different
        manner, since the same substance, if differently digested,
        receives a different form. This is sufficiently patent from the
        fact that different limbs are generated from the same substance.
        As with marchasite, so it is with tutia, magnesia, and all other
        like substances. Thus, through many mistakes, and by a process
        of elimination, we at length, through the grace of God, arrive
        at the substance which we firmly believe to be the right one.
        This short exposition must suffice for the present. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of The Spirits </i>---</b> There are
        three mineral spirits: quicksilver, sulphur and <i>arsenic.
          Arsenic </i>is hot and dry, of great virtue and potency, yet
        lightly esteemed. It burns up all other bodies. There are two
        kinds of <i>arsenic</i>, one is of a pale white, the other red.
        The red is combustive, the white is solvent, and useful for the
        Tincture; with quicksilver it makes silver. It has a fiery
        nature, and sublimes quickly. This spirit we strive to render
        corporeal and fixed, in order that it may permanently colour our
        substance. It has great affinity for vinegar... </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also an unfortunate fact that in the
        initial stages certain poisons do produce beneficial effects. <i>Arsenic</i>,
        for example, improves the appetite, increases growth and
        stimulates the production of bone marrow. Up to the very end the
        victim of <i>arsenic</i> poisoning consumes his food with a
        fair appetite. Because arsenic produces a mild dilation of the
        blood vessels, it was prescribed as an aphrodisiac regularly in
        India and Europe well into the 19th century and even appeared in
        an aphrodisiac preparation listed in the 1957 edition of the <i>British
Encyclopedia

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, errors in translation or
        copying led to dangerous results. The Byzantine Greek Nicolaus
        Myrepsus compiled a book of remedies, using Arabic sources. He
        mistranslated the Arabic "darsini" (cinnamon) for <i>arsenic</i>.
        The mistaken belief that large doses of arsenic had beneficial
        medicinal properties threatened alchemists and their patients
        until the 17th century... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the negative evidence was
        accumulated by alchemists who continued to believe in the
        possibility of transmutation. One convinced adept, for example,
        left an anonymous record of 104 alchemical recipes he had
        methodically tested... In the midst of all these failures he
        does record one success: a silver recipe using <i>arsenic</i>.
        Somehow this worked, for beside it the adept wrote, "gewinnt man
        vil silber darpei." </p>

        which Ripley, endorsed by Eirenaeus, says are useless, and even
        injurious in the work. Other eminent alchemists, in their candid
        moments, warn students against using these and many other
        ingredients: Antimony (not worth a mite), amalgams, acids,
        ardent and corrosive waters, <i>arsenic, orpiment</i>... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section III: The Speech of the
            Philosophers</i> ---</b> In his <i>Short Way and Repetition</i>,
        Basil Valentine gives the following seriatim illustration of the
        work, viz.: a crowned lion, a crowned eagle, a crowned serpent
        without wings, an uncrowned flying dragon, a crow or raven, a
        peacock, a swan, a pelican, feeding its brood with its own
        blood. The crowned lion, eagle and serpent are transmuted; they
        are of the process. Basil Valentine described his process, as if
        done out of ordinary gold; but this metal he did not use as his
        base; for, as he says, it would require about ten pounds weight
        of the vitriol of gold to do so. But as gold is the ultimate
        product or offspring, therefore, it is permissible to call the
        parent, or sire, gold also. This substance the philosophers
        called immature or unripe gold, or the "Green" Lion. In the
        second stage of the work --- the analysis of the green lion ---
        a white salt ascends, like snow, and adheres to the sides of the
        vessel, "much like sublimate," as Ripley says. This is their
        Eagle, Sublimate, <i>Arsenic</i>, Sal Alembroth, Sal Ammoniac,

        white, yellow and red, but inwardly it is adorned with all

        then take artificial Chrysocolla, such as Goldsmiths use to
        solder with, and red <i>Arsenick</i>, and by degrees strew them
        in: when you have done this, cast in an equal part of Silver,
        and let it be exquisitely purged by a strong vessel made of

        water of separation, and the Gold will fall to the bottom of the

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter XII: Preparation of the
            Arsenic </i>--- </b><i>Arsenic</i> is equal to Mercury,
        both in its property of whitening and in the occult virtues of
        its nature, that is why Paracelsus reiterates in his <i>Librum
          de l'Aurore</i> about Mercury and all its preparations, and
        takes in its place <i>arsenic</i> well prepared and well
        purified of all its impurities. For the purification and
        preparation in the manner of the Philosophers, take equal parts
        of crystalline <i>arsenic </i>and of good vulgar sandarac,
        powder them and put them in a retort with a quantity of common
        water, and give the fire of distillation till the water has just
        gone over and taken with it all the blackness and impurities of
        the <i>arsenic</i>, and everything that can sublimate has
        issued, then, when you open your retort, you will find that all
        the sublimate to be false white flour, which is all the impurity
        of the arsenic, and at the bottom you will find all the good
        substance in the form of a beautiful crystalline regulus. After
        it is prepared in this way, it can sublimate with antimony and
        vitriol instead of sublimated Mercury, and thus make the Triad
        of Paracelsus. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare the <i>arsenic</i> again with
        greater strength, separate the powdery substance from the ore by
        sublimation with Mars... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublimation of Arsenic</i> ---</b>
        Take good strong <i>arsenic</i> and fix it by calcination with
        saltpeter according to the art. Take of this calcined <i>arsenic</i>
        6 ounces with as much good sublimate, and 4 oz of common salt,
        prepared or decrepitated, put everything in a sublimation
        furnace or in a proper flask in an ash-fire, and when the
        moisture has completely vanished, plug it with cotton,
        continuing and augmenting the fire of sublimation by degrees
        till the sublimate has completely risen into the neck of the
        vessel, it will happen in 12 hours if you manage the fire
        correctly. Finally, expose the phial or the flask to the air, so
        that it breaks of its own and you can separate your materia all
        the better. Take this sublimate and resublimate it another 3 or
        4 times with fresh materia. This is to give it a coagulative
        impression and the white tincture of <i>arsenic</i>, which is a
        great secret. When this sublimate has been prepared in this way,
        mix it with half the powdered tartar, adding some vinegar and
        always proceeding as is done in the reunification of cinnabar.
        Thus you will prepare a Mercury with this sublimate which, when
        clean and purified, is preferable to the vulgar in all kinds of
        chemical operations. </p>

        through their nuptial and royal bond, begot two royal children,
        Phryxos and Helle, that is, a solar sulphur and a royal mercury.
        They were born in the kingdom of Thebes, that is, the higher
        elements. Some other planets, for their part, and especially
        Jupiter, had sent a contrary current, that of their feelings and

        so much because it is green in colour as because it had not yet
        acquired those mineral characteristics, which in chemistry
        distinguish the adult state from the nascent one. It is a green
        and sour fruit, compared with the red, ripe fruit. It is
        metallic youth on which Evolution has not yet worked, but which
        contains the latent germ of real energy, which will be called

        seem to have any meaning. Each of them is repeated three times
        on the concave back of the niche… <br>
        What, then, is this RER? --- We have seen that RE means a thing,
        a matter; R, which is half RE, will mean a half thing or a half
        matter. RER, then, is the equivalent of a matter increased by
        half of another or if itself. Note that it is not here a
        question of proportion, but of a chemical combination
        independent of relative quantities. In order to make myself
        better understood, let me give an example. Let us suppose that
        the matter represented by RE is<i> realgar</i>, or natural
        sulphur of <i>arsenic</i>. R, half RE, could then be the
        sulphur of the <i>realgar</i> or its <i>arsenic</i>, which are
        similar or different according to whether you consider the
        sulphur and the <i>arsenic</i> separately or combined in the <i>realgar</i>.
        In this way the RER will be obtained by augmenting the <i>realgar</i>
        with sulphur, which is considered as forming half the <i>realgar</i>,
        or with <i>arsenic</i>, which is seen as the other half in the

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; The Salamander of Lisieux (II)</b></i>
        <b>---</b> This substance, at once positive and negative,
        passive containing its own active agent, is the basis, the
        foundation of the Great Work. Of these two natures, taken
        separately, the one which plays the role of the feminine matter
        is the only one indicated and alchemically named on the corbel
        bearing the overhang of a second-story beam [at the Manor of
        Lisieux]. The figure of a winged dragon can be seen, its tail
        curled into a ringlet. The dragon is an image and symbol of the
        primitive and volatile body, true and unique subject upon which
        one must first work. The philosophers have given it a multitude
        of diverse names besides the one under which it is commonly
        known. This has caused and still causes so much difficulty, so
        much confusion, to beginners, and especially to those who are
        little concerned with principles and do not know how far the
        possibility of nature can be expanded. In spite of the general
        opinion averring that our subject had never been named, we
        assert on the contrary that many books name it and that all
        describe it. However, while it is mentioned by the good authors,
        it cannot be said that it is underlined or expressly shown; it
        is often encountered classified among the bodies that have been
        rejected as improper or alien to the work. This is a traditional
        technique used by Adepts to divert the lay people and to hide
        from them the secret entrance to their garden. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its traditional name, the stone of the
        philosophers, is descriptive enough of the body to serve as a
        useful basis for its identification. It is, indeed, genuinely a
        stone, for, out of the mine, it shows the external
        characteristics common to all ores. It is the chaos of the
        sages, in which the four elements are contained, but in a
        confused, disorganized manner. It is our old man and the father
        of metals which owe their origin to it, as it represents the
        first earthly metallic manifestation. It is our <i>arsenic</i>,
        cadmia, antimony, blende, galena, cinnabar, colcothar,
        aurichalcum, <i>realgar, orpiment</i>, calamine, tutia, tartar,
        etc. All ores, through the hermetic voice, rendered homage to it
        with their name. It is still called black dragon covered with
        scales, venomous serpent, daughter of Saturn, and "the most
        beloved of its children". This primal substance has seen its
        evolution interrupted by the interposition and penetration of a
        filthy combustible sulphur, which coats its pure mercury, holds
        it back, and coagulates it. And, though it is entirely volatile,
        this primitive mercury, materialized by the drying action of the
        arsenical sulphur, takes the shape of a solid, black, dense,
        fibrous, brittle, crushable mass rendered, by its lack of
        utility, vile, abject, and despicable in the eyes of man. Yet,
        in this subject -- poor relative of the metal family --- the
        enlightened artist finds everything that he needs to begin and
        perfect his Great Work, since it is present, say the authors, at
        the beginning, the middle, and the end of the Work… </p>
      <p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Salamander of Lisieux (V)</b> </i><b>---</b>
        From the combat that the knight, or secret sulfur, engages with
        the <i>arsenical</i> sulfur of the old dragon, is born the
        astral stone, white, heavy, shining as pure silver, and which
        appears to be signed, bearing the imprint of its nobility, its
        stamp esoterically translated as the griffin, a sure indication
        of the union and peace between fire and water, between earth and
        air. However, we should not hope to attain this dignity from the
        first conjunction. For our black stone, covered with rags, is
        soiled by so many impurities that completely freeing it from
        them is extremely difficult. For this reason it is important to
        submit it to several levigations (which are Nicolas Flamel’s
        lavueres or fire purifications), so as to progressively cleanse
        it from impurities and from heterogeneous and tenacious stains
        which encumber it, and to see it take on, with each one of these
        fire purifications, more splendor, more polish, and more
        brilliance… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to possess the griffin --- which
        is our astral stone --- by tearing it from its <i>arsenical</i>
        ganque, take two parts of virgin earth, our scaly dragon, and
        one part of the igneous agent, which is that valiant knight
        armed with the lance and the shield. Ares, more vigorous than
        Aries, must be in a lesser quantity. Pulverize and add the
        fifteenth part of this pure, white, admirable salt, washed and
        crystallized several times, which you must necessarily know.
        Intimately mix it; and then, following the example of the
        painful Passion of Our Lord, crucify it with three iron nails,
        so that the body dies and can then be resurrected. This done,
        drive away the coarsest sediments from the corpse; crush and
        triturate the bones; mix the whole thing on a slow heat with a
        steel rod. Then throw this mixture half of this second salt,
        extracted from the dew that fertilizes the earth in the month of
        May, and you will obtain a body clearer than the preceding one.
        Repeat the same technique three times; you will reach the matrix
        of our mercury, and you will have climbed the first rung of the
        ladder of the sages. When Jesus resurrected the third day after
        his death, a luminous angel clothed in white alone occupied the
        empty sepulchre... </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louis d’Estissac (III)</i></b> --- As
        for the second body --- passive and feminine --- Louis d’Etissac
        had it represented under the shape of a harelipped gnome,
        equipped with breasts, head covered with a scaly helmet. We
        already knew from the descriptions left by classical authors
        that this mineral substance as it is extracted from its mine is
        scaly, black, hard, and dry. Some have called it leprous. The
        Greek lepis, <i>lepidos</i> (scale), has among its derivative
        the Greek <i>lepra </i>(leprosy), because this frightful
        infection covers the epiderm with pustules and scales. And so it
        is essential to drive away the coarse and superficial impurity
        from the body by removing its scaly envelope (<i>lepizo</i>), an
        operation which we easily realize with the aid of the active
        principle, the agent with the grooved helmet. Taking as an
        example Moses’ gesture it will suffice to sharply strike this
        rock (<i>lepas</i>) of arid and dry appearance three times in
        order to see the mysterious water that it contains, spring
        forth. It is the first solvent, common mercury of the sages,
        faithful servant of the artist, the only thing he needs and that
        nothing can replace according to the testimony of Geber and of
        the most ancient Adepts. Its volatile quality which allowed
        philosophers to assimilate this mercury to the common
        hydrargyrum, is moreover emphasized on our bas-relief by the
        tiny lepidoptera wings (Greek <i>lepidos-pteron</i>) affixed to
        the shoulders of the symbolic monster. However, in our opinion,
        the best name that authors have given to their mercury seems to
        be Spirit of Magnesia. For they call magnesia (Greek <i>magnes</i>,
        magnet) the coarse feminine matter which attracts by an occult
        virtue the spirit enclosed beneath the hard shell of the steel
        of the sages. The latter, penetrating like a burning flame into
        the body of the passive nature, burns, consumes its
        heterogeneous parts, drives away the <i>arsenical</i> (or
        leprous) sulfur, and animates the pure mercury it contains and
        which appears in the conventional form of a liquor both humid
        and igneous --- the fire water of the ancients --- which we call
        Spirit of Magnesia and universal solvent. </p>

        say that the stone is a worm filled with venom and accuses it of
        being the enemy of man and metals. Nothing is more true; so much
        so that others reproach our subject to contain a frightful
        poison whose very odor, they insist, would suffice to cause
        death. Yet it is from this toxic mineral that the universal
        medicine is made, which no human illness can resist, no matter
        how incurable it is thought to be. But that which gives it all
        its value and makes it infinitely precious in the eyes of the
        sage is the admirable virtue it possesses, of revivifying metals
        that have been reduced and molten and of losing its poisonous
        properties by granting them its own activity. And so it does
        appear to be the instrument of resurrection, and of redemption
        of the metallic bodies, dead by violence of a reducing fire, the
        reason for which it bears in its coat of arms, the sign of the
        Redeemer, the cross. </p>

It







        now remains that we at present speak of <i>Arsenick</i>. We say
        it is of a subtile Matter, and like to Sulphur; therefore it
        needs not be otherwise defined than Sulphur. But it is
        diversified from Sulphur in this, viz. because it is easily a
        Tincture of Whiteness, but of Redness most difficultly: and
        Sulphur, of Whiteness most difficultly: but of Redness easily.
        Of Sulphur and <i>Arsenick</i> there is a twofold Kind, viz.
        Citrine and Red, which are profitable to this Art; but the many
        other kinds not so. <i>Arsenick</i> is fixed as Sulphur; but
        the Sublimation of either is best from the Calx of Metals. Yet

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magister Degenhardus, Lullius and
        Matthesius, in his <i>Serpa Concione</i> 3, write that the
        material of the metals should be like buttermilk before it
        hardens into a metallic form, and that it can be spread like
        butter. They call it <i>GUR</i>, and I have found it myself in
        mines where Nature has made lead. And if one is also able to
        make such a material here above the earth, then that should be a
        sure sign not only that one has the right Materia, but also that
        one is undoubtedly on the right path. This I can make, praise be
        to God, with my own hands. When left in warmth an hour it goes
        into a state of putrefaction, so that it turns black, then
        reddish, and finally red-brown. The philosophers call it Lac
        Virginis, the Milk of the Virgin. Thus, if one puts a little
        Salis Metallici in our water, it becomes like a white milk, and
        if one puts a lot therein, then it turns thick like butter and
        can be spread like fat or a similar substance. I have thought it
        well to mention this, in order that you may harbor no doubts
        concerning the Materia, and this will be proven to you with the
        help of the only Creator. </p>

        silver while they are still in blossom, and thus easily
        affected, they should be placed in an oven that is proper for

        short time, although Nature would have taken a long time on
        them, due to her weak digestion. Thus such ores can very often
        now give forth their spiritual, immature gold as mature,

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it is to be known, that Nature
        hath her passages and veins in the Earth, which doth distill
        Waters, salt, clear and turbulent. For it always observed by
        sight, that in the Pits, or Groves of Metals, sharp and salt
        Waters do distil down. While therefore those water do fall
        downwards, (for all heavy things are carried downwards) there
        are sulphureous vapours ascending from the center of the Earth,
        that do meet them. Therefore if the waters be saltish, pure and
        clear, and the sulphureous vapours pure also; and that they
        embrace one another in their meeting, then a pure Metal is
        generated; but in defect of purity, an impure Metal: in
        elaborating of which, Nature spreadeth near, or about a thousand
        years, before that she can bring it to perfection; which cometh
        to pass either by reason of the impurity of the salt Mercurial
        waters, or of the impure sulphureous vapors, When these two do
        embrace each other, shut ip close in the rocky places; then of
        them a moist, thick, fat vapour doth arise by the operation of
        natural heat, which taketh its seat where the air cannot come

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, my Child, why is Saturn as fluxible as
        Wax ? By reason of its' abounding Sulphur, which is therein; for
        I find no fluxibleness or fusibleness in anything saving
        in&nbsp; Sulphur, Mercury and <i>Arsenick</i>, and all these
        three are in Saturn; so that Saturn is quickly fluxible, but all
        these three are cleansed with it from their uncleanness. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you not know, that the Philosophers
        call their Stone <i>Arsenick</i>, and a white thing; and they
        say their Sulphur is incombustible; they call it likewise a red
        thing, all this is Saturn, in it is <i>Arsenick</i>; for Luna
        is principally generated of a white Sulphur, as is plainly
        taught in the Book of Sulphur, and all <i>Arsenick</i> is
        internally red as Blood, if its' inward part be brought
        outwards, as is demonstrated in the <i>Book of Colours</i>.
        Saturn stands almost in the degree of fixed Luna. So that in it
        there is a red Sulphur, as you see, when its internal is placed
        outwards, it will be red as Ruby; there are no Colours but in
        the Spirits, so that there is in it a red and a yellow Sulphur.
        In it is Mercury, as may be seen, for Mercury is extracted out
        of Saturn in a short time, and with it little labour. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that all three are in Saturn, but they
        are not fixed therein, but they are clean, pure, incombustible,
        fluxible as Wax; in it are all things which the Philosophers
        have mentioned. They say, our Stone is made of a stinking
        menstruous thing: What think you, is not Saturn digged out of a
        stinking Earth? For divers are killed with the ill Scents and

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 86: The Twenty-Fourth Work of
            Arsenicum</i></b> --- Now I will teach my child how to make
        the white Stone from <i>arsenic</i>. Take <i>arsenic</i>, 4 or
        5 lbs; powder it finely; then take alum, egg chalk, calamine and
        common salt, all dried at a gentle fire, that is, 2 parts of
        common salt to 1 part of each of the others. Pound them well
        together, and for every 4 lbs of <i>arsenic</i>, take 8 lbs of
        the other matters. Mix them together and put them into a
        sublimation vessel; sublimate the <i>arsenic</i>. Pound what
        has been sublimated among its faeces, and sublimate it again.
        Repeat it once more. Now mix the <i>arsenicum</i> sublimatum
        with as much fresh matter as your <i>arsenicum</i> weighs;
        sublimate it and repeat 3 times. After this, sublimate again 3
        times with as much fresh matter. Then your <i>arsenic </i>will
        become clear, white and transparent like crystal. Dissolve that
        in aqua fort, made of alum, egg chalk, calamine and saltpeter,
        as much as all the others weigh together. Dry them to the point
        of dusting, put them into a distillation pot and distill as one
        normally makes aqua fort. Put the caput mortuum, powdered, back
        into the pot, pour your aqua fort again on it, distill for 36
        hours till nothing drips any longer. After this, keep it glowing
        for another 36 hours; repeat that again, rectifying it with its
        caput mortuum. It is achieved with the third distillation. With
        this dissolve your sublimated <i>arsenic</i>, draw the water
        off, and sublimate the <i>arsenic</i> again; and again dissolve
        it in the said water. Do this 3 times, each time dissolving in
        fresh water. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 87</i> </b>--- Now take as
        much silver as the weight of the <i>arsenic</i>, dissolve it in
        common aqua fort, and beat it down. Wash this chalk with common
        water of its saltiness, and dry it on a moderate fire. Take this
        calx Lunae and the prepared <i>arsenic</i>, pound them together
        on a stone, put them into our sublimatorium, and sublimate them
        of the chalk, at first heating fairly strongly, so that the
        distillation pot stands there in a soft glow, for 2 hours. Then
        let it cool down, and remove the sublimate; again pound it with
        its fecibus, and set it again to sublimate as before. Do this 4
        times, and you have sublimated all the spirit or quintessence of
        the silver with the <i>arsenic</i>. Then put the faeces of the
        silver to reverberate or calcinate in the sublimation furnace,
        for 4 days and nights, in a soft glow not too hot or it would
        melt and spoil everything. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then take it out, put it into your stone
        jar, pour distilled wine vinegar on it, set it in the balneum
        for 4 days and nights, and proceed in every way as I have taught
        above in the work of antimonium, when I instructed you how to
        prepare the salt, earth, or corpus. Subsequently, pound it
        together intangibly on a stone, and for that take twice as heavy
        of our burning blessed water to the White. Put everything
        together into a fixing glass, seal it hermetically, put it on a
        furnace in a dish with ashes, and again give moderate fire, and
        everything will dissolve into pure water, also rise and fall,
        until it stays fixed as a crystalline, clear oil, which is a
        perfect Elixir. It translates mercury and tin into true silver.
        Put this into a glass ampule or egg, seal it, set it for 40 days
        and nights in a tripod, and it will coagulate into the

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should also know that the oil of all

        separate, the earth rises together with it, as their oils cannot
        be separated from the earth, which can be done with other
        things. They knew well that if they wish to follow Nature, they
        needed such oils to increate and make their spirit and dry earth
        liquid. They found them in sulphur and <i>auripigment</i>, but
        ten times more in mercury. In this way the art of ceration was
        invented… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luna has two sicknesses, like other
        imperfect metals, but its two sicknesses do not go to the inmost
        root as do those of the other imperfect metals. One sickness is
        the combustible sulphur, the other is cold and humidity. The
        first sickness is eliminated with <i>arsenic</i> and washing.
        Know that the substance of <i>arsenic</i> is so strong that it
        burns and destroys all bodies. The same is done by <i>auripigment</i>
        and sulphur; these three are of one nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When <i>arsenic</i> and <i>auripigment</i>
        are disembodied and cleansed of their impurity, density, and
        wild unfixed spirits, and you take the idle spirit, then with
        this spirit you will drive away the combustibility of the
        sulphur of metals by calcining, washing, purging, reiterating.
        Consequently, <i>arsenic</i> and <i>auripigment</i> are
        comparable to theriac. For if the poison in the theriac is not
        prepared, it will kill man; but when it is prepared, it drives
        the poison out. Likewise <i>arsenic</i> and <i>auripigment</i>.

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By means of catalytic action I have
        succeeded in manufacturing gold chemically by acting on silver
        with <i>arsenic</i> and antimony sulfides, tellurium, and tin.
        The process gives a very high yield which has already been
        confirmed by several chemists... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a mixture composed of chemically pure
        silver and 1 gram of chemically pure <i>orpiment</i> and placed
        it in 36° nitric acid for several months cold and then brought
        it to ebullition. The liquid was kept at the boiling point for
        several days. A small quantity of the material became detached
        at this point and formed a pulvurent black deposit. When no
        further action took place, I decanted off the solution and
        collected the insoluble residue. This residue was attacked by
        aqua regia at the boiling point until it was almost completely
        dissolved; the liquor when decanted and filtered was analyzed
        and gave all the characteristic reactions for gold. (December
        1925) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acted on 22 grams of pure silver... and on
        3.5 grams of pure <i>orpiment</i>... The mixture was heated to
        about 1600° C. In a metal smelting furnace for about three
        quarters of an hour. The residue obtained was again melted with
        the addition of <i>orpiment</i>. After having hammered for half
        an hour and remelted with the addition of small quantities of <i>orpiment</i>
        every ten minutes, it was withdrawn. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cooling and the addition of chemically
        pure antimony sulfide, it was again put back into the furnace,
        small quantities of <i>orpiment</i> being thrown in every five
        minutes. The residue obtained had a dark metallic tint. After
        hammering it became slightly golden. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The residue dissolved in pure 36° nitric
        acid first cold and then hot, gave an abundant pulvurent
        deposit. This deposit after being washed and treated with
        ammonia to dissolve the arsenic and antimony salts was
        completely dissolved in aqua regia. The liquor then being
        chlorinated and filtered was subjected to the usual reagents of
        platinum and gold... <br>
        I submit the hypothesis that the <i>arsenic</i> acts as a
        catalyst and the sulfur as a ferment in this transmutation... </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …In the face of huge numbers every thought
        of individuality pales, for statistics obliterate everything
        unique. Contemplating such overwhelming might and misery the
        individual is embarrassed to exist at all. Yet the real carrier
        of life is the individual. He alone feels happiness, he alone
        has virtue and responsibility and any ethics whatever. The
        masses and the state have nothing of the kind. Only man as an
        individual being lives; the state is just a system, a mere
        machine for sorting and tabulating the masses. Anyone,
        therefore, who thinks in terms of men minus the individual, in
        huge numbers, atomizes himself and becomes a thief and a robber
        to himself. He is infected with the leprosy of collective
        thinking and has become an inmate of that insalubrious stud-farm
        called the totalitarian State. Our time contains and produces
        more than enough of that ‘crude sulfur’ which with ‘<i>arsenical</i>
        malignity’ prevents man from discovering his true self. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was tempted to translate <i>arsenicalis</i>
        as ‘poisonous’. But this translation would be too modern. Not
        everything that the alchemists called ‘<i>arsenic</i>’ was
        really the chemical element As. ‘<i>Arsenic</i>’ originally
        meant masculine, manly, strong, and was essentially an Arcanum,
        as Ruland’s <i>Lexicon</i> shows. There <i>arsenic</i> is
        defined as an ‘hermaphrodite’, the means whereby Sulphur and
        Mercury are united. It has communion with both natures and is
        therefore called Sun and Moon. Or <i>arsenic</i> is ‘Luna, our
        Venus, Sulphur’s companion’ and the ‘soul’. Here <i>arsenic</i>
        is no longer the masculine aspect of the arcane substance but is
        hermaphroditic and even feminine. This brings it dangerously
        close to the moon and the crude Sulphur, so that <i>arsenic</i>
        loses its solar affinity. As ‘Sulphur’s companion’ it is
        poisonous and corrosive. Because the arcane substance always
        points to the principal unconscious content, its peculiar nature
        shows in what relation that content stands to consciousness. If
        the conscious mind has accepted it, it has a positive form, if
        not, a negative one. If on the other hand the arcane substance
        is split into two figures, this means that the content has been
        partly accepted and partly rejected; it is seen under two
        different, incompatible aspects and is therefore taken to be two
        different things… </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gur</b></i><b> </b>--- Its sign,
        however, is this: in the caves of the mountains where the
        workers labor and dig our gold or silver, a white oil drips out
        and when it has disappeared in the ground in which there is this
        Cohyle or the seed and the beginning of the gold, there will be
        something glowing from the earth like a tear or like a white
        blood, and like a tear of a plant or a grapevine when they are
        cut, and it is similar to drops of light water in its seeping
        out, and after a day or night it will coagulate and be similar
        to the saliva of the mouth or the milk or water foam. And after
        a certain time when you see it, you will find it slightly
        reddish and this redness will increase every day, and when it is
        redder than coagulated blood, but not yet hard as stone, but
        soft and like a salve and cream, then the gold in it is
        completed, but not yet stable in the heat of the fire, and it
        will not be stable until it coagulates and becomes similar to a
        hard rock, and this is the word of King Saba, which he talks
        about in his book <i>Kaba Thabiban</i>, the oil, the butter of
        the wise. It is a bird in the world and it is white like snow,
        and it is the bird of all birds since it doesn’t fly underneath
        the sky and above the earth like other birds, but it comes down
        from the height of the sky into the deepest abysses in the
        interior of the earth, and its flight goes through stone and
        ground, through rock and the abysses of the sea; this bird in
        reality is the Phoenix of the Wise and alchemists, and if it
        doesn’t join with the mother of the gold in the earth and this
        become white and slightly stable, then the alchemists will not
        be able to complete it in a long time except if it comes down
        every day and flies into the interior of the earth and hides and
        unites with the mother of the gold, and when you first see it
        you will compare it with the seed of men, and its face, if
        white, will turn red after some time, and it will be soft as
        butter or a salve; but when its softness changes the gold is
        born and stable in fire. This Cohyle has no name, just like the
        Cohyle of the first way has none. But the experienced of those
        working inside the mountains when they find this Cohyle, they
        answer and say we have preceded the birth of the son and the
        completion of the gold because, see, the son is received, and
        due to our hurry we have found no gold… my son, choose this
        Cohyle, the butter of the wise men; you can find when it is red
        like blood, choose it, because with it you will hurry to its
        end, and if it is white like saliva of the mouth, choose it
        because with it you will understand even more; therefore when
        possible choose the red one and the white one, but choose it
        soft like a fatty substance… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In our opinion, the word <i>GUR </i>is not a
        German but a Hebrew word... Our matter, then, so writes the
        author of this process, is one single thing, but of two
        substances, subject to Saturn, and surrounded by his circle,
        wherein is found the Humidum Radicale, and a fixed grain of
        gold, still unhurt, quite alive, with soul and spirit, and it is
        a congealed vapor and a white coagulated juice, which nature
        itself has given up, or sublimated, in the Mineris Sol &amp;
        Luna, heavy by weight, of a metallic kind and quality, and yet
        not a metal in itself. It can be spread like lard, or a very
        subtle amalgam, it attaches itself everywhere to the walls, like
        fat, quite glistening. In every viscous sulphur, or water, there
        lies hidden in its center a Centrum Concentratum, meaning: The
        salt of Nature, which is the light of the world, and the true
        Materia Prima gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As proof, take as much of this subject as
        you like, pour upon it twice distilled dew water, the first time
        as is, the next time through a dozen double-fine blotting
        papers, as is correctly taught and shown in the <i>Fama
          Hermetica mense Februario</i>. Once distilled, let it stand
        for a few days in digestion, stirring it somewhat every day.
        Then, out of this subject will extract itself the hidden Centrum
        concentratum, or Sal Naturae: When this extract has cooled down,
        filter it, and when the moisture has evaporated from it through
        a dozen double-fine blotting papers, one will see this Sal
        Naturae and Lumen Mundi so beautiful, splendid and glistening as
        the stars at the firmament are always glittering and glistening.
        But if it is further treated philosophically, it can even be
        turned into a brightly shining oil. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often one breaks and finds also cobalt,
        which contains little or almost no metal. But by digging further
        in the pits, one will find the same white coagulated metallic
        juice. It is formed plentifully in nearly all mines, especially
        where there is gold and silver, but that which is mined in
        Hungary is to be preferred to all others. Our earth is gold and
        silver, but not the natural and common. It is of one thing and
        root. <i>Astrum gerit masculinum et femininum genus tamen
          exinde persublimationem Archael fit crystallus, qui habit
          naturam aquae, cum quaignis et Sulphur redigenda sunt in

        in their work. It is generally called by them: <i>aurum
          immaturatum, seu astrum Solis, semen Solis</i>, metal seed,
        also sometimes Arabian gold. When they find such matter, they
        say, we have come too early or too late<i>, dicitur etiam</i>.
        Before it congeals into a metallic form, it is like butter and
        can be spread like butter. The first matter of metals is not
        Mercurius vivus, but a sticky, sulphurous vapor, and a viscous
        water, in which viscous water the three Principia: Sal comm.,
        Sulphur and Mercury are gathered. This matter is known to all
        true philosophers, and it is the true Agens and Patiens. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My teachings will repel many and they will
        be astonished when they learn that I prepare the gold with <i>arsenic</i>...







      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulphur removes all the poison from <i>arsenic</i>
        and antimony. If a man were to reflect on the true prime origins
        of gold and other metals, or if he were to take the Mineram
        Solis, which is one with the other metals, he could immediately
        change it back into its prime matter. From this the reader
        learns of the properties of <i>arsenic</i>, how quickly its
        poison can be removed and thus it is transformed into a better
        substance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first constituent of all marcasites and
        metals is <i>arsenic</i>. In what mineral or metal can we find
        common quicksilver except very rarely and accidentally? Instead,
        you will find <i>Arsenicum</i> and sulphur in each of the
        aforementioned, be it little or much, but usually in quantity. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Jo. Agricola in <i>Popp. Nuremburg</i>
        1681, 4, P. II, <i>Tr. de Arsenico</i>, P. 997, where it is
        written: "Without a reason, one should not be surprised that
        this mineral is so closely related to Sulphur, that they are
        almost sprung from one spring, but in their effects they are
        almost opposites... It is a King of Medicine when it is
        corrected, one grain or less of it has the most salutory effect
        in countless diseases. It is penetrating and tinges the blood
        and vital spirit so intensely that it becomes capable of
        dispersing even the most pernicious enemy from the body; which
        other medicines, lacking this power, can never accomplish.
        Therefore, you must search in every way to find out how its
        poisonous nature can be allayed...". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t it by experience that we know that
        gold and silver buried under the earth are aroused when the
        salty moisture of the earth wakens the sour spirits of gold and
        silver into action; that is why one has found only their electra
        or even only some dust instead of gold and silver. When
        therefore gold and silver have been put in places where many <i>arsenical</i>
        or marcasitical vapors evaporate, they are sooner destroyed by
        Nature. We can see this in the Art, which must necessarily
        follow Nature in just these steps, when we melt sulphur, <i>arsenic</i>
        and marcasite together and let them flow, then put glowing gold
        into it, so that the gold turns into all powder which is then
        immediately dissolved by the salts or salty vapors or spirits
        and reduced to its first nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise with metals or minerals: the
        medicine or tincture does not intend to heal the sulphur, <i>arsenic</i>
        or marcasite, but the metals, and even if it were thrown upon
        sulphur, <i>arsenic</i> or marcasite, it would not turn them
        into pure gold and silver, but into a pure solar or lunar
        nature. Therefore, such a solarized sulphur, <i>arsenic</i> or
        marcasite can also be made into gold or silver by digestion and
        maturation, but not into pure gold and silver as metals are
        transmuted by casting and melting, etc. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gur</i></b> <b>---</b> The portion of
        the earth which the corrosive [vapor] has been unable to
        dissolve completely, is made subtle, dirty, and greasy in part.
        Alchemists call it a metallic gur, or the first matter of
        metals, but wrongly so, because it is the first and nearest
        matter to sulphur and <i>arsenic</i>. When <i>arsenic</i>
        becomes marcasite, that then is the very nearest matter to
        metals, because metals spring directly from marcasite and not
        from this gur which is only the distant matter of metals. This
        gur or dirty substance is made ever finer by the rising
        corrosive vapors and is more and more dissolved. And the more it
        becomes subtle, the more it congeals the corrosive within
        itself, and that makes it sulphurous and <i>arsenical</i>. This
        <i>arsenic</i> is increasingly ripened into marcasite, and the
        marcasite in turn into metal. Such is the progress of metals,
        which we intend to show ever more clearly. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the vapors rise into the cracks and
        crevices of the rocks, they turn into water because of their
        condensation (while more and more rise unceasingly). This water
        contains the intermingled spirit of salt and saltpeter, which
        spirit is known by all alchemists to be corrosive. Here,
        however, in the center, it is surrounded and diluted by much
        Phlegma and water. Such spirits adhere to rocks and earth by
        their sharpness, corrode and dissolve them, make them subtle,
        swollen, sticky, greasy and dirty, and turn them into a moist <i>gur</i>
        which lies between the rocks and the earth like meat interlarded
        with bacon. But often it penetrates outside due to the swelling
        and adheres to the walls, as may be seen in old galleries and
        mines. The more dissolved and refined such dissolved earth
        becomes through vapors and salty spirits, the more it swells,
        pressing and driving out the remaining moisture by this
        swelling. In turn, this moisture runs back to the center or
        elsewhere into other corners and holes of the earth. This
        swollen earth or<i> gur</i> now has no peace, because the
        continually rising and subsequent vapors are attacking it ever
        more, adhere to it, congeal and coagulate with the earth; and
        the more such corrosive vapors follow, the more fiery,
        sulphurous the earth becomes. The more sulphurous it becomes,
        the higher it swells, and more moisture it drives off, and
        becomes the drier the longer it lasts. The drier it becomes,
        however, the more the sulphurous component part loses its
        combustibility and thereby acquires the name of mercury, or
        rightly, <i>arsenic</i>, which has originated in the sulphurous
        acidity. It no longer burns, but is still volatile. This
        volatility, however, is gradually more bound by the central heat
        between the stones, and thereby congealed and coagulated, so
        that it is transformed into a marcasite. If the digestion or
        earthy central heat is strong, the marcasite is congealed into a
        metal; but if it is weak, it remains what it is or becomes a
        marcasite or <i>arsenic</i> choke-damp, or pyrite. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now one must know that when nature has got
        so far that she had made sulphur or <i>arsenic</i>, she has
        already filled the crevices and chasms and dissolved and caused
        so much earth to swell that the crevices are full to the brim.
        Then the earth does not admit any more vapors or moisture, and
        is no longer in dissolution. Now begins the dessication,
        fixation and coagulation, and passes from there to a metallic
        nature or fixity. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the earth and rock are the mother
        and foundation, or the vessel, of minerals in which fossil ore
        bodies are made, so the vapor is their food. Vitriol or
        vitriolic <i>gur</i> is the root, sulphur and <i>arsenic</i>
        the stem, marcasite the flower or blossom, metals, the seed, the
        completed birth and offspring. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That vitriol is first born of sulphur and <i>arsenic</i>
        can be proven by <i>gur</i>, if it is lixiviated, filtered and
        coagulated. Then one finds a vitriolic salt after the kind of
        earth that has been dissolved. That sulphur or <i>arsenic</i>
        originate in this way, can be seen during dismemberment. When
        the Acidum or the sour vapor is driven by fire, it distills
        first. It is followed by the flowers of sulphur, then the <i>arsenic</i>,
        then the volatile marcasite. The fixed marcasite flows into a
        regulus and slag. That marcasite is made from <i>arsenic</i>,
        can again be seen in dismemberment, because bismuth and antimony
        driven into flowers are quite <i>arsenical</i> and volatile,
        and also have the total nature and quality of <i>arsenic</i>. </p>

        the things, and note generating or augmenting; Whence the
        radical moistures are the essential parts of the Stone imbibed
        in the things themselves, of which alone the parts of the thing
        consist, therefore by it, it is augmented and nourished. But it
        is the truly germinating Nature, which the more it is decocted
        by the Phlegm, in its Vessel, by a Fire forcing is the more
        ingrafted into all and every one of the Parts, it is adorned,
        and so made fitter that manifold Fruits may be generated out of
        it: For this is called the middle nature, and the Stone,
        Mercury, <i>Arsenick</i>, and the noble spirit partaking of
        both extremes, the White Sulphur and the Red, binding up Mercury
        an converting it into better Silver than that of the Mine… </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Arsenick</i> is of the same nature
        as the Sulphur; both tint to red and to white. But there is more
        humidity in the <i>Arsenick</i>, and it sublimes less rapidly
        over the fire than the Sulphur. <br>
        One knows how well Sulphur sublimes quickly and how it consumes
        all the bodies, except God. The <i>Arsenick</i> can unite its
        dry principle with that of the Sulphur, they temper each other,
        and once united, one separates them only with difficulty, their
        tincture is toned down by this union. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The <i>Arsenick</i>”, says Geber,
        “contains much of the Mercury; it can also be prepared like it”.
        Know that the Spirit hidden in the Sulphur, the <i>Arsenick</i>
        and the animal oil, is named by the philosophers The White
        Elixir. It is unique, miscible with the volatile substance, from
        this one we extract the red Elixir; it unites with the melted
        metals, thus as we have experimented with it, it purifies them.
        Not only because of the aforementioned properties, but also
        because there is one common proportion between its elements… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to philosophy, the Elixir also is
        called Medicine, because one assimilates the body of metals in
        the body of animals. Also we say that there is a hidden Spirit
        in the Sulphur, the <i>Arsenick</i> and the oil extract of the
        animal substances. It is that spirit for which we search, with
        whose aid we will tint all the imperfect bodies to perfection.
        This Spirit is called Water and mercury by the Philosophers.
        “The mercury”, says Geber, “is a medicine composed of the dry
        and the humid, the humid and the dry”. You understand the
        succession of operations: extract the earth from the fire, the
        air from the earth, the water from the air, since the water can
        resist the fire. It is necessary to mark well these teachings,
        they are Universal Secrets. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the principles which enter into the
        Work have strength by themselves; for they are linked in the
        metals, they cannot be perfected, they are not very fixed. Each
        lacks two substances, one miscible with the metals in fusion,
        the other fixed which enables it to coagulate and fix. Also
        Rhases said: “There are four substances which change in season:
        each one of these is composed of the four elements and takes the
        name of the dominant element. Their marvelous essence was fixed
        in one body, and, with this last, one can nourish the other
        bodies. This essence is composed of water and of air, combined
        in such a way that the heat liquefies them. Here it is: a
        marvelous secret. The minerals employed in Alchemy must, in
        order to serve us, have an action upon the melted bodies. The
        stones we use are four in number, two tint to white, the two
        others to red. Also: the white, the red, the Sulphur, the <i>Arsenick</i>
        and Saturn have only that one same body! But in this single
        body, what obscurities! And at first it is without action upon
        the perfect metals”… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will add that from the four imperfect
        bodies, one can extract all. As for the manner of preparing the
        Sulphur, the <i>Arsenick</i>, and the Mercury most highly
        acclaimed, one can bring it forth here. <br>
        Indeed, when in this preparation we heat the spirit of the
        Sulphur and of the <i>Arsenick</i>, with the acid waters or the
        oil, for in extracting this volatile essence, the oil or
        unctuosity, we raise them above that which is superfluous to
        them; it leaves the volatile force and the oil, these things
        alone are those which are useful to us; but they are mixed in
        the acid water which served us in purifying, there is no means
        of separating these, but at least we are rid of the useless. It
        is necessary therefore, to find another means to extract from
        these bodies in order to obtain the water, the oil, and the very
        subtle spirit of the Sulphur which is the true very active
        Tincture for which we search… </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Purification of the Spirits</i></b>
        --- The purification of spirits consists in the removal of all
        superfluities, but without the corruption of essentials. There
        are three kinds of spirits, mineral, vegetable, and animal. The
        mineral spirits, again, are properly three: sulphur,
        quicksilver, and <i>arsenic</i>, which operate naturally in
        metals, and to which metals, prepared by Art, are naturally
        joined. Of these, sulphur is the great active, quicksilver the
        great passive principle, while <i>arsenic</i> represents the
        secondary operations of quicksilver; but all three unite in the
        composition of the Elixir… </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Arsenic</i></b> --- <i>Arsenic</i>
        is a mineral body composed of earth and water; it is oleaginous,
        like sulphur, but having more earth than oil, and containing a
        more gross and earthy sulphur. Its purgation for the first
        sublimation is by means of substances which dry up and consume
        its oleaginous superfluity, which is the first humidity. The
        aqueous superfluity, which is the second humidity, must be
        evaporated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In God’s name, take ponderous, lucid, red or
        yellow <i>arsenic</i>, pound small with an equal weight and a
        half of iron or copper filings; sprinkle with vinegar, dry,
        place between layers of its sediment over a fire, till there be
        no more steam, close up vessel, increase fire more and more till
        all is sublimed; cool, collect what appears outside the
        sediment, place between new layers, in each case about the
        thickness of one inch; sublime as before, till it is white,
        pure, crystalline, and free from all humidity and superfluity.
        This may be done by means of five or six sublimations; dissolve
        , and then coagulate, as in the case of sulphur, whether for the
        white or red. <i>Arsenic</i> is of less potency in the
        coagulation of Mercury than sulphur, but it is possible to
        extract from it an igneous virtue. </p>

      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. The Four Spirits of Metals Which
          Color</b> --- Note that the four spirits of metals are
        mercury, sulphur, <i>auripigmentum</i> or <i>arsenicum</i>,
        and sal ammoniac. These four spirits color metals white and red,
        that is, in Gold and Silver: yet not of themselves, unless they
        are first prepared by different medicines for this, and are not
        volatile, and when placed in the fire burn brilliantly… </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15. What is Auripigmentum and What is its
          Origin?</b> --- <i>Auripigmentum</i> is a mineral stone and
        is made thus. Earthen dung pits in the bowels of the earth
        through long processes of decoction transform it into the
        substance of <i>auripigmentum</i>. Its viscosity is twofold:
        one is fine and the other coarse: one is freed through washing
        and decoction in urine; another through sublimation, as stated
        below. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Addition. Auripigmentum</i> is active
        and burning, unless whitened. After sublimation it may whiten
        copper into a species of silver: this is done by adding two
        parts of sal ammoniac to four of rock salt, placing the latter
        on top of the former, and repeating the process three times
        until you are satisfied. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>16. <i>What is Arsenicum?</i></b> --- <i>Arsenicum</i>
        is a subtle substance of a sulphurous color and occurs as a red
        stone [Realgar]. By nature it is like <i>auripigmentum</i>: the
        flowers are white and red. It is easily sublimed and is whitened
        in two ways: through decoction and sublimation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>33. <i>What is Fixation and in How Many
            Ways are Bodies Fixed?</i></b> --- Fixation is the
        appropriate tempering of a volatile substance in fire. It was
        devised so that every coloring, and every alteration is
        perpetuated in another and is not changed: for bodies, whose
        perfection has been diminished through calcinations, are fixed
        when they are freed from corrupting and volatile sulphureity.
        Sulphur and <i>arsenicum</i> are fixed in two ways: one method
        is the repetition of their sublimation from one state to
        another, or until they achieve stability. Spirits are also fixed
        in another way, either with the solutions of metals or with oil
        of tartar, as I shall say below. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Addition</i>. Take sublimed mercury, an
        equal amount of sal ammoniac, and sublime seven times, or until
        melted, let the stone remain at the bottom; crush it and expose
        to damp air so it will become a liquid. Soak metallic <i>arsenicum</i>
        in this water, dissolve in distilled vinegar, and distill seven
        times, or congeal, and dissolve, and a stone will result. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metallic <i>arsenicum</i> is made by
        melting one part of arsenicum with two parts of white soap.
        Another procedure is given in Geber’s <i>Liber Fornacum</i>:
        where you may read it if you wish. Either sublime mercury, or
        sulphur, or prepared <i>arsenicum</i>, or several of these, at
        the same time, along with sal tartarum or saltpeter, or sal
        ammoniac. Do this many times until they remain fixed, then
        extract with warm water. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39. <i>How is Auripigmentum Whitened?</i></b>
        --- You should grind <i>auripigmentum</i> and boil it one day
        in vinegar, and another in urine. Then add to it a like amount
        of black iron powder, mix well, then sublime, doing everything
        as I taught concerning sulphur, and it will become white. </p>
      <p><i>Addition.</i> <i>Auripigmentum</i> is called yellow <i>arsenicum.







          Auripigmentum</i> is prepared from vinegar and salt until it
        rises clear; there is no better way of purifying it. Rhases says
        the same elsewhere: salt is the best of all for this
        preparation. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40. <i>How is Arsenicum Whitened?</i></b>
        --- <i>Arsenicum</i> is of the same nature as <i>auripigmentum</i>,
        but it is not necessary to boil it. Therefore, grind well and
        imbibe with strong vinegar (Roger says with distilled vinegar,
        as you will see, when he speaks of the calcinations of bodies)
        two or three times, or four, and dry as many times. Then it can
        be reserved as a powder which will be suitable for calcining
        bodies. But if you wish to sublimate, grind well by itself and
        add to it the same amount of black iron powder. Sublimate seven
        times or more, following all I have taught concerning mercury,
        and it will be whiter than snow. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now consider what an authority said, that
        this magistery is customarily accomplished with a single matter.
        Attend well to this and apply yourself to it, and you will find
        no contradictions among the natures which you will perceive.
        Know that sulfur and <i>orpiment</i> burn, but do not long
        withstand combustion. Quicksilver always long withstands
        combustion, while all substances which approximate the nature of
        fire burn quickly. Thus you may expect best results from
        something which burns quickly in the fire and is reduced to
        coals... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that which prepares this body is blood,
        or virgin's milk, for it unites and joins all the various

        to apply to them a gentle heat that long continues at the same
        degree, neither increasing nor decreasing... Now the foul earth
        readily receives the white sparks and prevents destruction of
        the blood, or air, or virgin's milk, during decoction. But such
        is the blood's strength that it must be broken in order to
        promote rather than impede, and this is done after whatever
        still dark of the confused minerals has been whitened, thus

        metamorphoses of the <i>Huai Nan Tzu</i> book were avoided by
        later alchemists, who accepted much more straightforwardly the
        archaic idea of the gradual perfection of minerals within the
        terrestrial matrix. Here the idea is expressed with pristine
        simplicity in one of the most influential of all alchemical
        writings, the supplementary instructions (<i>chueh</i>),
        probably of the early Sung, which now accompany the Han Yellow
        Emperor’s <i>Canon of the Nine-Vessel Spiritual Elixir:</i> </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realgar</i> occurs in the same mountains
        as <i>orpiment</i>, and is formed by the transformation of <i>orpiment</i>.
        (This latter) great medicine of heaven and earth (i.e., of the
        natural order) is called 'doe yellow' (<i>tzhu huang</i>). When
        eight thousand years have passed, it transforms into <i>realgar</i>,
        the variant name of which is 'imperial male seminal essence (<i>ti






          nan ching</i>). After another thousand years have passed it
        transforms into yellow gold, with the variant name 'Victuals of
        the Perfected (or Realized) Immortals’ (<i>chen jen fan</i>)...
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the scriptures taken down by Yang Hsi,
        Thao had also found actual instructions for alchemical
        preparations. Two of these formulae still exist in their
        entirety. One, called <i>Thai-Shang Pa-Ching Ssu-Jui Tzu-Chiang
          (Wu-Chu) Chiang Shêng Shen Tan Shang Ching (Exalted Manual of
          the Eight-Radiances Four-Stamens Purple-Fluid Crimson
          Incarnation Numinous Elixir</i>, a Thai-Shang Scripture), is
        preserved in the <i>Shang-Chhing Thai-Shang Ti Chün Chiu Chen
          Chung Ching (Ninefold Realised Median Canon of the Imperial
          Lord</i>, a Shang-Chhing Thai-Shang Scripture); a work
        otherwise devoted to techniques for encountering various deities
        in meditation --- making them appear from within one's body,
        from the sun and moon, and from inside unusually coloured clouds
        that conceal the immortals as they travel through the sky. The
        elixir recipe itself, for all its twenty-four ingredients and
        104 days of heating, is clearly phrased in the language of the
        laboratory, and could be carried out in one today. The
        ingredients are given elaborate cover-names, but all are defined
        in notes recording oral instructions (<i>khou chüeh</i>)
        ascribed to the first Patriarch of Taoism, Chang Tao-Ling (+2nd
        century): e.g. Crimson Tumulus Vermilion Boy (<i>chiang ling chu
          erh</i> = cinnabar, HgS), Elixir Mountain Solar Animus (<i>tan
          shan jih hun</i> = <i>realgar</i>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>),



        Arcane Belvedere Lunar Radiance (<i>hsüan thai yüeh hua =
          orpiment</i>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>). The formula is not
        dissimilar on the whole to later alchemical recipes in
        terminology and technique... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of spatial orientation have already
        appeared in several of the documents above. Alchemical
        specifications of location were so tied conceptually to temporal
        correspondences that they are practically never found in
        isolation. One of the very few exceptions is particularly
        interesting because it is early, its context is medical, and it
        is concerned implicitly but unmistakably with emplacing the
        reactants within the reaction-vessel in such a way as to create
        a microcosmic configuration. This is not an alchemical elixir
        but a 'Panaceal Sublimed Yellow Powder' (<i>kuang chi fei huang
          san</i>), prescribed for sores and ulcerations in one of the

Thai
Pi







          Yao (Important Medical Formulae and Prescriptions</i> revealed
        by a provincial governor) of +752. That its ultimate source was
        alchemical is more than likely. Yoshida Mitsukuni has pointed
        out, similarities to a recipe in the <i>Thai-Chhing Shih Pi Chi
          (Records of the Rock Chamber</i>; a Thai-Chhing Scripture ---
        before +806), a practical collection of alchemical and
        iatrochemical formulae with Mao Shan associations. What Wang
        Thao says is as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take: Laminar malachite (<i>tshêng chhing</i>)
        Magnetite (<i>tzhu shih</i>), <i>Orpiment (tzhu huang) Realgar
          (hsiung huang)</i>, Fibrous <i>arsenolite (pai yü shih)</i>
        Cinnabar (tan sha), one ounce of each. Grind the above six
        ingredients to fine powders, and emplace them according to the
        colour correspondences of the directions: laminar malachite to
        the east, cinnabar to the south, white <i>arsenolite</i> to the
        west, magnetite to the north, and <i>realgar</i> in the central
        position. Two earthenware urns (<i>wa wêng</i>) are coated
        inside with yellow clay two or three times in order to make (a
        lining) five- or six-tenths of an inch thick. Then place
        powdered <i>orpiment</i> in the bottom. Combine and sieve the
        other ingredients and put them on top, afterwards laying (the
        other) half of the <i>orpiment</i> on top as a cover. Spread
        clay closely on the joint (between the two vessels, the mouths
        of which are now joined); and do not allow any of the <i>chhi</i>
        to leak out... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after Wu Wu's time someone who was
        trying to reason out the best possible way of making a container
        represent an egg hit upon the unsurpassable solution: he used a
        hen's egg itself. This may have come earlier, as early as the
        +9th century, but more probably it was a little later, in the
        Southern Sung. The <i>'Complete Compendium on the Lead-Mercury
          Perfected Treasure'</i> (<i>Chhien Hung Chia King Chih Pao Chi
          Chhing</i>) by Chao Nai-An, cites <i>'Secret Directions for
          the Yellow Sprouts Great Elixir' (Huang Ya Ta Tan Pi Chih)</i>.
        One stage of the preparation goes as follows: </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orpiment</i>, 1/2 ounce, Sal ammoniac,
        and White <i>arsenic</i>, 1/4 ounce each. First grind the <i>orpiment</i>;
        then grind the <i>arsenic</i> and sal ammoniac separately, fine
        as flour. Take an egg and make a hole in it. Get rid of the yolk
        but keep the white. Spread half the <i>arsenic</i> and sal
        ammoniac on the bottom inside the egg; put the <i>orpiment</i>
        in the middle, and half the <i>arsenic</i> and sal ammoniac to
        cover it. Take somewhat less than half an egg-shell to cover the
        hole, and seal it on with iron oxide solution (<i>chiang fan
          shui</i>) which has been mixed (with the egg-white?). Then
        take a pound of minium (<i>huang tan</i>) and an iron
        reaction-vessel (<i>ting</i>). Put half the minium into the
        vessel and place in its centre the medicines in the egg. Then
        cover them with the rest of the minium, applying a little
        pressure. Fill the vessel with lime (<i>shih hui</i>, evidently
        raw) and lute it tightly. Using half a pound of charcoal, heat
        it gently in an ash bath. When it is taken out it will be
        finished. For each ounce of <i>pai hsi</i> (zinc or tin) use a
        piece the size of a red mung bean (<i>hsiao tou</i>). First melt
        the metal, and when it is liquid project the medicine upon it.
        Pour it out and wait for it to cool. It will then be the colour
        of gold. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly what form of aurifaction was taking
        place here is not immediately obvious. The reagents heated
        together were <i>arsenic trisulphide</i>, ammonium chloride (or
        carbonate), <i>arsenic trioxide</i>, ferric oxide, lead
        tetroxide and calcium oxide, with or without, as the case may
        be, a protein as source of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen.
        Whether or not the tin or zinc was tinged golden only
        superficially is not clear from the description: if so, <i>arsenical</i>
        and other sulphides might have done just as well by themselves
        (cf. pt. 2, p. 252 above). If, on the other hand, copper was
        meant though tin or zinc actually stated, then a
        uniform-substrate golden alloy of <i>arsenical</i> copper could
        easily have been produced by projection as described (cf. pt. 2,
        p. 223 above).<br>

      <big><b>Robert Nelson ~ <i>A Novel Preparation of Arsenic Oxides
            from Orpiment / Realgar</i></b><b><br>
        </b></big><br>
      Since the beginning of metallurgy, arsenic trioxide has been
      prepared by oxidation of ores and collected from the chimneys of
      furnaces. Arsenic pentoxide has been prepared by reduction of the
      trioxide by nitric acid.<br>
      <br>
      Here is a new method for preparation of arsenic oxides from
      orpiment or realgar, that is simple, safe, fast, easy, efficient,
      and requires only one vessel. The yield is quantitative.<br>
      <br>
      Orpiment / realgar is pulverized and boiled with ammonia water to
      liberate the arsenic sulfides from ganque. After decanting from
      the residue, nitric acid is added until the solution is clear of
      visible ammonium nitrate.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture is heated for a few hours until it forms a white
      precipitate. Decant, filter, wash, and dry to yield arsenic
      pentoxide, and a small amount of trioxide depending on reaction
      conditions.<br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Tincture, Coloring Copper White by
        Means of <i>Arsenic</i>, as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Arsenic</i> is a kind of sulphur which
        volatilizes quickly; that is to say, volatilizes over the fire.
        All substances similar to <i>arsenic</i> are also called
        sulphurs and volatile bodies. Now the preparation is made thus:
        taking 14 ounces of lamellar <i>arsenic</i> the color of gold,
        cut it into pieces, grind it so as to reduce it to particles as
        fine as down; then soak it in vinegar for 2 or 3 days and as
        many nights, the material being closed up in a glass vessel with
        a narrow neck, carefully luted at the top at the top so that it
        shall not be dissipated. Shaking once or twice a day, do this
        for several days; then, emptying the vessel, wash with pure
        water, only just until the odor of vinegar has disappeared.
        Guard the most subtle part of the substance; and do not let it
        be thrown out with the water. After allowing the mass to dry and
        contract in the air, mix and pulverize it with five ounces of
        salt of Capaddocia [common salt]. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the use of the salt was devised by the
        ancients to avoid the <i>arsenic</i> sticking to the glass
        vessel. This glass vessel is called asympoton by Africanus. It
        is luted with clay; a glass cover in the shape of a cup is
        placed above. At the upper part, another cover envelopes the
        whole; it is fastened tightly on all sides, so that the
        distilled <i>arsenic</i> may not be dissipated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then distill it repeatedly and pulverize it,
        until it became white; thus we obtain a white and compact alum.
        Then melt the copper with some hard Nicean copper; then take
        some of the flower of soda and throw it into the bottom of the
        crucible 2 or 3 parts to flux it. Next add the dry powder
        (sublimed <i>arsenic</i>), with an iron ladle; put in the
        amount of one ounce to 2 pounds of copper. After that, put into
        the crucible for each ounce of copper a little silver, with a
        view to making the color uniform. Then throw into the crucible
        again a small amount of salt, Thus you will have a very fine
        alloy. [ M. Berthelot ~<i> Collection des Anciens Alchimistes

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being therefore moved with compassion
        towards the well-meaning operators of this art, I have
        determined to lay open the whole foundation of philosophy in
        three separate arcana, namely, in one explained by <i>arsenic</i>,
        in a second by vitriol, and in a third by antimony; by means of
        which I will teach the true projection upon Mercury and upon
        imperfect metals. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter IX. Concerning Those Who Have
            Sought The Stone In Minerals</i> ---</b>&nbsp; Now, here
        note that Nature has distributed its mineral sperm into various
        kinds, as, for instance, into sulphurs, salts, boraxes, nitres,
        ammoniacs, alums, <i>arsenics</i>, atraments, vitriols, tutias,
        haematites, orpiments, <i>realgars</i>, magnesias, cinnabar,
        antimony, talc, cachymia, marcasites, etc. In all these Nature
        has not yet attained to our matter; although in some of the
        species named it displays itself in a wonderful aspect for the
        transmutation of imperfect metals that are to be brought to
        perfection. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter X. Concerning Those Who Have
            Sought The Stone And Also Particulars In Minerals</i> ---</b>
        Some have taken <i>arsenic</i> several times sublimated, and
        frequently dissolved with oil of tartar and coagulated. This
        they have pretended to fix, and by it to turn copper into
        silver. This, however, is merely a sophistical whitening, for <i>arsenic</i>
        cannot be fixed unless the operator be an Artist, and knows well
        its tingeing spirit. Truly in this respect all the philosophers
        have slept, vainly attempting to accomplish anything thereby.
        Whoever, therefore, is ignorant as to this spirit, cannot have
        any hopes of fixing it, or of giving it that power which would
        make it capable of the virtue of transmutation. So, then, I give
        notice to all that the whitening of which I have just now spoken
        is grounded on a false basis, and that by it the copper is
        deceitfully whitened, but not changed. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the sophists have mixed this counterfeit
        Venus with twice its weight of Luna, and sold it to the
        goldsmiths and mint-masters, until at last they have transmuted
        themselves into false coiners --- not only those who sold, but
        those who bought it. Some sophists instead of white <i>arsenic</i>
        take red, and this has turned out false art; because, however it
        is prepared, it proves to be nothing but whiteness. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter XI: Concerning the True &amp;
            Perfect Special Arcanum of Arsenic for the White Tincture</i>
          ---</b> Some persons have written that <i>arsenic</i> is
        compounded of mercury and Sulphur, others of earth and water;
        but most writers say it is of the nature of Sulphur. But,
        however that may be, its nature is such that it transmutes red
        copper into white. It may also be brought to such a degree of
        perfection as to be able to tinge. But this is not the way
        pointed out by such evil sophists as Geber in <i>The Sum of
          Perfection</i>, Albertus Magnus, Rhasis and Polydorus; for
        these writers, however many they be, are either themselves in
        error, or else they write falsely out of sheer envy, and put
        forth receipts whilst not ignorant of the truth. <i>Arsenic</i>
        contains within itself three natural spirits. The first is
        volatile, combustible, corrosive, and penetrating all metals.
        This spirit is crystalline and sweet. The third is a tingeing
        spirit separated from the others before mentioned. True
        philosophers seek for these three natural properties in arsenic
        with a view to the perfect projection of the wise men. But those
        barbers who practice surgery seek after that use in the cure of
        wounds, buboes, carbuncles, anthrax, and other similar ulcers,
        which are not curable save by gentle means. As for that tingeing
        spirit, however, unless the pure be separated from the impure in
        it, the fixed from the volatile, and the secret tincture from
        the combustible, it will not in any way succeed according to
        your wish for projection on Mercury, Venus, or any other
        imperfect metal. All philosophers have hidden this arcanum as a
        most excellent mystery. This tingeing spirit, separated from the
        other two as above, you must join to the spirit of Luna, and
        digest them together for the space of thirty-two days, or until
        they have assumed a new body. After it has, on the fortieth
        natural day, been kindled into flame by the heat of the sun, the
        spirit appears in a white brightness, and is endowed with a
        perfect tingeing arcanum. Then it is at length fit for
        projection, namely, one part of it upon sixteen parts of an
        imperfect body, according to the sharpness of the preparation.
        From thence appears shining and most excellent Luna, as though
        it had been dug from the bowels of the earth. </p>

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter XVIII. Concerning Arsenic used
            for Alchemy</i> ---</b> It seems right to connect <i>Arsenic</i>
        generically with Sulphurs rather than with Mercuries, and to
        treat it immediately after Sulphurs. Some old chemists, or
        rather sophists, labouring at chemistry, swelling with jaundice,
        that is, with desire for gold, a sort of yellow dropsy, when
        they saw in <i>Arsenic</i> the white Tincture of Venus, and the
        red tincture in the calamine stone, believing, too, that the
        true arcanum of the stone was contained in these, thought the
        white and red electrum were silver and gold until they found out
        the contrary by tests, and learnt that they had been engaged in
        a vain work. And not content with that they went on perversely
        in order to arrive at a fixation, and persevered until they had
        neither house nor possession left. They had wrought a
        transmutation in themselves rather than in the metal! And what
        wonder? They approached this work without judgment, and
        possessing no knowledge of minerals and metals, as so many of
        those who embark in the Art at the present day do. Since the
        time when the name of electrum given by the ancients passed into
        oblivion, there has forthwith followed the ruin of those who
        changed that name into fictitious gold and silver. That has been
        the destruction of modern chemists. To define Electrum: it is a
        metal made from some other by Art, and no longer resembling that
        Form from which it was made. For example: <i>arsenical</i>
        metal, prepared according to the form of metallic preparation,
        cemented with Venus in the accustomed manner, converts the whole
        copper into white electrum more worthless than its own copper.
        What need is there to deprave metals at great expense? Would it
        not be better to leave the copper in its own natural essence, to
        keep one's money, and devote time and labor to a more useful
        work? The ancients called Electrum by its proper name, the
        moderns falsely call it silver. The ancients were not losers,
        because they knew the Electrum itself; the moderns, because they
        have no knowledge of Electrum, throw away their faculties,
        labour, and time. Now, since in Alchemy all mistakes are
        constantly propped up with some new hope, it was tried to fix <i>Arsenic</i>
        by means of reverberations for some weeks, and by other devices.
        Thence it ensued that the&nbsp; <i>Arsenic</i> became red and
        brittle like coral, but of no use in Alchemy except for
        Electrum, as was just now said. Then by descent and
        precipitation they effected nothing more than by their
        calcinations. Thus it happens in Alchemy obdurate men are
        deceived because they do not learn thoroughly from the
        foundation all the terms of the Art. It is true that <i>Arsenic</i>
        does, in its own natural condition, contain gold, and that this
        gold, by the industry of the artist, can sometimes be separated
        in a cement, or a projection, or otherwise, into silver, copper
        or lead by attraction, but it does not therefore follow that
        this is produced by his operations and his tinctures. It means
        only that the gold which was there before has been derived by a
        process of separation, as it generally is, from its ore. It is

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green <i>suspita</i> mentioned in
        connection with gold had given rise to various interpretations.
        The <i>Zohar</i> commentary <i>Nosose Orot</i> explains: "It
        is called in Arabic <i>zarnikh [arsenic]</i>, and in La'az <i>orpimento</i>,
        and it causes men's hair to fall out." Later commentators
        explained it as "green copper which is called allatun". Robert
        Eisler, in a 1925 article on the terminology of Jewish alchemy,
        emended the reading of the word to <i>susepta</i>, and
        suggested that it stood for the Greek <i>sussepte</i>, meaning
        decayed or putrefied gold... </p>

        is taken the philosophic mercury, was composed of nine letters,
        whereof are four vowels, the rest consonants, whereof is one
        syllable composed of three letters, and the rest of two,
        believed they had discovered that materia in the name <i>Arsenicum</i>,
        the more so in that the Philosophers hold their materia to be a
        poison of the most dangerous nature; but the materia of the
        stone is the very same as that whence are formed <i>arsenic</i>

        drawn from <i>arsenic</i>; for <i>arsenic</i> is sold by
        Apothecaries and Druggists, and the ore of mercury is everywhere
        to be found, in the woods, in the mountains, in valleys, in
        water, on earth, &amp; in all lands. Philalethes &amp; various
        other Philosophers gave also the name <i>arsenic</i> to their
        materia in putrefaction, for it is then a poison most subtile
        &amp; of the greatest violence. At times also by <i>arsenic</i>
        they understand their volatile principle, the which does office
        as the female. It is their Mercury, their Luna, their Venus,
        their vegetable Saturne, their Green Lion, &amp;c. This name, <i>arsenic</i>,

        with two parts of the Virgin Diana into one Body; I ground it
        very fine, and with this I have prepared my mercury, working
        them all together in heat, until that they were most exquisitely
        incorporated: then I purged it with the Salt of Urine, that the
        Faeces did separate, which I put away. </p>
      <p><b><i>(5) The Secret of the just Preparation of the Sophic

        being purged from their Crow-like blackness, make it to fly the

      </p>
      <p><b><i>(6) The Secret of the Sophic Mercury </i>---</b> I have
        taken the proper quantity of the Mercury, and I mixed it with
        its true <i>Arsnick</i>, to wit, about four ounces of Mercury,
        and I made a thin commixed consistence; I purged it after a due
        manner, and I distilled it, and I had a pure Body of Lune,
        whence I knew that I had rightly prepared it: afterwards I added
        to its weight of <i>Arsnick</i>, and I increased its former
        weight of Mercury, in so much that the mercury might prevail to
        a thin flux, and so I purged it, to the wasting of the blackness
        almost to a Lunary whiteness: then I took half an ounce of the <i>Arsnick</i>
        of which I made a due Marriage, and there was made a temperature
        like Potters Loam, but a little thinner; I purged it again,
        after a due manner, the Purgation was laborious: I made it with

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>An Exposition upon Sir George
            Ripley’s Third Gate ---</i></b> Note then that Sublimation,
        which otherwise is called Separation, Division, Ascension and
        Descension, is the Key of the Work; it is placed for the third
        Gate, and yet it is the last and the first; the last it is
        called by Ripley, and I to Echo his Voice assure thee it is the
        first and last. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as the Key of all our Operations is
        Separation, so the Key to it is our true Mercury, truly prepared
        and proportioned as it ought to be. Now the proportion of thy
        Water, is in reference to its internal additional Sulphur, which
        is added by the Philosopher; which is done by successive Eagles,
        which are made by our Philosophical <i>Arsnick</i>, the number
        of which ought to be seven. The darkness vanishing, and the
        light appearing, after many showers, before the flight of each
        Eagle, our Water being thus actuated, is by Acuation purged, and
        then it becomes powerful in dissolving the Body, which will be
        done with a fewer number of eagles, or a greater, but with 7 or
        9 most desiredly. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This actuated Water is also the Instrument
        which doth move the gold to putrefie, which no other Agent in
        the World can do; for by this the Body is ground, softened and
        mollified, the pores of it are softened, and the Sulphur
        invisible is set at liberty, which causeth the Body to rot,
        change colours, and at length become black like unto melted
        Pitch. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if thou omit any of the number of
        eagles, or fail in the goodness of thy <i>Arsnick</i>, or err
        in the preparation of the Water with thy <i>Arsnick</i>, either
        in Conjunction, or Purification, or Digestion, or any other
        errour, of which experience will warn thee, do not then expect
        that the most exact Regimen of heat of thy external Furnace will
        do the Work. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Exposition upon Sir George Ripley's
            Preface ---</i></b> And now indeed if any be ignorant, let
        him be ignorant; I know not what more to say, and not transgress
        the silence of Pythagoras. I have told you that our matter is
        two-fold, crude and fixed; the fixed is by Nature perfected to
        our hands, and we need only to have it made more then most
        perfect, which Nature alone could never perform; nor is there
        any thing that can thus exalt Tinctures, but our dissolving
        Water, which I told you floweth from three Springs; the one is a
        common Well at which all draw, and of which Water many use; this
        Well hath in it a Saturnine drossiness, which make to Waters
        unuseful; these frigid superfluities are purged by two other
        Springs, through which the Water of this Well is artificially
        caused to run: these Springs make but one Well, whose Waters
        appear dry, the humidity being sealed; the Well it self is
        surrounded by an <i>Arsenical</i> Wall, the slimy bottom
        abounds with the First Ens of Mineral Salt and Sulphur, which
        acuate the Water of the first Well, whose primary quality is
        Coldness; being thus actuated, it becomes so powerful a
        Menstruum, and so pleasant to the Metals, that for its peculiar
        Vertue it is chosen for to be the Bath of the Sun and Moon. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>An Exposition upon Sir George
            Ripley’s Fifth Gate</i></b> --- If then thou accend this
        heat so much as that it predominate, it will not then dissolve
        the Bodies, as thou expectest, but contrariwise burn the Flowers
        before they are extractd from the depths of their marrow: this
        thou mayst easily do, either if thy <i>Arsnick</i> be not made
        as it ought, or else the number of Eagles exceeded, or the
        proportion of thy Water to thy Body not agreeing to the number
        of Eagles, or thy Glass not well proportioned to thy Matter; it
        will easily burn, if thy Glass be too big, for so the moisture
        will so much be dispersed about the Concave, that it will not
        return before the earth below be left too dry. I have given
        Rules easily to avoid all these inconveniences. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the other hand, be sure that thou do
        not erre in too little heat; let thy Water have Fire enough
        within it, to make a true division and corruption, which if
        either thy <i>Arsnick</i> have sufficient Fiery virtue, or if
        the union of this and thy Water be not well attended, but
        slightly performed, or the Purgation of thy water be not
        thoroughly made each eagle, for so two or three eagles may not
        add the virtue of one, or if thy number of eagles be not just,
        or thy proportion of quantity be not duly observed... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray then to God, that he would be
        propitious unto your studies and labours, in giving thee the
        true knowledge of this secret Mystery; it is the gift of God, I
        have holpen thee what I can, but venture not to practice barely
        upon my words, for know that what I have only hinted, is far
        more then what I have discovered; and what I have declared to
        thy first apprehension most openly, hath yet its lurking Serpent
        under the green Grass, I mean some hidden thing which thou
        oughtest to understand, which thou being Cock-sure at first
        blush wilt neglect; but yet it will bite thee by the heel when
        thou approachest to practice, and make thee begin again, and it
        may be at last throw away all as a man desperate: for know that
        this is an Art very Cabalistical, and we do study expression
        such as we know will suit almost with any mans fancy, in one
        place or other; but be sure to take this Maxim from one who
        knows best the sence of what he hath written: Where we speak
        most plainly, there be most circumspect, for we do not go about
        to betray the Secrets of Nature; especially then in those places
        which seem to give Receipts so plain as you would desire,
        suspect either a Metaphor, or else be sure that something or
        other is supprest, which thou wilt hardly without Inspiration
        ever find of thy self, which in tryal will make all thy
        confident knowledge vanish; yet to a Son of Art, we have written
        that which never heretofore was by any revealed. </p>

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Spirits</i></b> --- There are
        three mineral spirits: quicksilver, sulphur, and arsenic. <i>Arsenic</i>
        is hot and dry, of great virtue and potency, yet lightly
        esteemed. It burns up all other bodies. There are two kinds of <i>arsenic</i>,
        one is of a pale white, the other red. The red is combustive,
        the white is solvent, and useful for the Tincture; with
        quicksilver it makes silver. It has a fiery nature, and sublimes
        quickly. This spirit we strive to render corporeal and fixed, in
        order that it may permanently colour our substance. It has great
        affinity for vinegar. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This spirit must be cleansed, sublimed, and
        exalted; then it will do what no man would think possible. Take
        pallid <i>arsenic</i>, pound well into powder, place in a
        glazed pot, pour over it four times as much clear strong
        vinegar. When most of the <i>arsenic</i> is dissolved, after
        three days, place over a gentle fire, steam off the liquid, take
        it out, place in a dish, wash well of all saltness with pure
        water, and dry in the sun. Place again in a glazed pot, pour
        over it four times its quantity of water of alum, and let it
        evaporate over the fire. Put in an aludel, add twice its
        quantity of common purified salt, close the vessel, and seal it
        up carefully. Sublime cover fire from morning till noon. Cool,
        open the vessel, and you will find in it a brilliant substance.
        Place it in a glass vessel, pour over it its own quantity of
        water of alum, and leave for eight days. Take up what floats on
        the surface, put it in a small narrow-necked bottle, coagulate,
        and you will find a crystalline stone; keep until necessary to
        use, and see that it is free from dust. If you digest this
        arsenic with milk or oil of bitter almonds, and afterwards with
        water of alum, it will be very brilliant and beautiful in the
        sublimation; and then it dissolves very easily. If <i>arsenic</i>
        be cooked with olive oil, and then with water of atrament, it
        will be found in the sublimate brilliantly red and easily
        soluble. Red <i>arsenic</i>, when its ferment is added, makes
        glad the heart of the Alchemist; but it is not so easily
        dissolved as white flaky <i>arsenic</i>. Hence you should use
        the later for dissolving and sublimation. To sublime with
        quicksilver, cook in the manner described one pound of <i>arsenic</i>
        with one ounce of quicksilver. </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sulphur</i> </b>--- The decoction
        of sulphur is the same as that of <i>arsenic</i>. But as
        sulphur has much air, as well as much hotness and dryness, it is
        not easily sublimed. To effect this purpose, cook it well, and
        dissolve it; you will then be on the road to perfection. Without
        the three substances which I have mentioned, there can be no
        silver or gold, <i>arsenic</i> being best for silver, and
        sulphur for gold. Some say that if sulphur be mixed with living
        calx, it can be easily sublimed; but I do not wish you to waste
        your labour. Know, however, that arsenic is more valuable in the
        Lunar, and sulphur in the Solar work. Sulphur is partly white
        without, and partly red within. Of <i>arsenic</i> the opposite
        holds good… </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Gold</i></b> --- The Sages call
        gold the product of the sun. When it is perfect, the fire cannot
        hurt it, but rather intensifies its colour. If you wish to make
        gold, you must ferment it, or all your labour will be in vain.
        Moreover, the ferment must be pure. Nevertheless, it does not
        require much purification, since it is in itself sufficiently
        pure, but it must be prepared so that it may be easily
        incorporated and fermented, and for this purpose it must be
        calcined as we will shew further on. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat pure gold into thin leaves; then take
        red <i>arsenic</i>, pound, add a third part of common salt
        (i.e., one-third part of the <i>arsenic</i>), take seven ounces
        of steel filings, pound the three together; take a small, new,
        glazed pot, put a little of this powder at the bottom of the
        pot; over it place a plate of gold, cover the plate with more
        powder, and so fill up with alternate layers. Take another
        glazed pot, put in one pound olive oil, boil over a gentle fire,
        add four ounces of clear yellow sulphur; remove at once from the
        fire, stir with an iron rod till the sulphur is melted, and
        allow to cool. Add some of this oil to the contents of the other
        pot; simmer over gentle fire, till absorbed; add more, place
        again on the fire, and so on, little by little, till all the oil
        has been absorbed. Then leave it on the fire till quite dry. All
        this can be done in 24 hours. Stop up the pot with the clay of
        Sages; next morning, place the pot among the coals of a gentle
        fire, so that it is entirely covered, from 6 to 9 a.m.. Take
        pot, cool, break it, pound its contents; afterwards pound the
        gold, place the whole in dish, add sweet and clear water, and
        stir it. When the powder has settled at the bottom, remove the
        water (for it is salt); add more water, till the powder has
        quite lost its saltness. Dry it in the sun, or by a fire, place
        in a small pot, stop up with clay, place in furnace for the
        space required for baking bread. Then rejoice, for you have
        pulverized and fermented gold… </p>
      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Silver</i></b> --- Silver, though
        composed in the same way, is not quite so pure or well digested
        as gold, and suffers from two kinds of humidity, sulphureous and
        phlegmatic, or evaporant. Yet silver may be properly purified by
        fire; but if being cooked with common sal and <i>orpiment</i>,
        it grows black, while there is no blackness in the salt or the <i>orpiment</i>,
        this is a sign that it is suffering from the first humidity. The
        sign of the second humidity is diminishment in the fire. By
        purification and digestion it can be transmuted into gold, for
        its infirmity is of a negative kind. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is the best way of changing
        silver into gold… Take thin plates of [pure] silver, five pounds
        of <i>arsenic</i>, and one ounce of steel filings; pound them
        well together. Take some of this powder, cover with it the
        bottom of a pot, put over that place a silver plate, over that
        some more of the powder, and so fill the pot with alternate
        layers of plates and powder. Let there be powder over the top of
        all. Place on a slow fire, over the coals, pour over it strong
        vinegar, and leave it from 6 to 9 a.m.. Let the moisture
        evaporate, stop up with clay of Sages, and plunge pot among
        red-hot coals; keep up a powerful fire or 12 hours. Then open
        the pot (after cooling), separate the silver from the powder,
        pound in mortar, wash with clean water in a dish. Dry in the
        sun. Add to the powdered silver equal quantities of sal
        armoniac, of sublimed coagulated quicksilver, and of white
        sublimed <i>arsenic</i>; pound, put in a bottle, pour over it
        four times as much water of alum, and leave for two days. Plunge
        bottle up to neck, which should be narrow, in a pot full of
        ashes; the bole should be unstopped ill its contents are
        coagulated. Then stop it up, and place over fire for 24 hours.
        Let it cool, and then break bottle; if anything be sublimed up
        to the neck, combine all together; pound its contents, place in
        glass vessel, pour over it twice as much water of alum, and
        leave for 8 days, shaking it twice or thrice every day. Skim off
        what floats on the surface into a small narrow necked bottle;
        evaporate the liquid from the remaining faeces, add one-half
        ounce of it to 20 ounces of copper, and it will become the
        purest silver. Coagulate the contents of the bottle in a pot
        full of ashes, then add one-half ounce of it to 250 ounces of
        copper, 150 ounces of tin, or 50 ounces of lead, and you will
        witness a wonderful transformation. There is another way of
        carrying out this operation, but here is the most efficacious,
        and however the coagulated substance the preparation of which I
        have described may be obtained, it has the property of
        transmuting larger or smaller quantities of copper, tin or lead
        into the most irreproachable silver. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Of Arsenic</i></b> --- <i>Arsenic</i>
        is a mineral body composed of earth and water; it is oleaginous,
        like sulphur, but having more earth than oil, and containing a
        more gross and earthy sulphur. Its purgation for the first
        sublimation is by means of substances which dry up and consume
        its oleaginous superfluity, which is the first humidity. The
        aqueous superfluity, which is the second humidity, must be
        evaporated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In God’s name, take ponderous, lucid, red or
        yellow <i>arsenic</i>, pound small with an equal weight and a
        half of iron or copper filings; sprinkle with vinegar, dry,
        place between layers of its sediment over a fire, till there is
        no more steam, close up the vessel, increase the fire more and
        more till all is sublimed; cool, collect what appears outside
        the sediment, place between new layers, in each case about the
        thickness of one inch; sublime as before, till it is white,
        pure, crystalline, and free from all humidity and superfluity.
        This may be done by means of five or six sublimations; dissolve,
        and then coagulate, as in the case of sulphur, whether for the
        white or red. <i>Arsenic</i> is of less potency in the
        coagulation of Mercury than sulphur, but it is possible to
        extract from it an igneous virtue. </p>

      <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 3 </i>--- </b>About metallic
        things R. Mordecai wrote: Let the red mineral of silver be
        taken, let it be ground most finely, then add to six ounces of
        it an ounce and a half of the calx of Luna. Let it be placed on
        a sand bath in a sealed vial. Let it be given weak fire for the
        first eight days lest its radical humidity be burnt up. In the
        second week, one degree stronger, and in the third, yet
        stronger; and in the fourth so that the sand should not be red
        hot, but that when water is dripped upon it, it should hiss.
        Then on top of the glass, you will have a white matter, which is
        the materia prima, the dyeing <i>arsenic</i>, the living water
        of the metals, which all philosophers call dry water, and its
        vinegar. This is how it is purified: Take some of this
        sublimated crystalline pure matter. Let it be ground on marble
        with calx of Luna in equal parts. Let it be put in a sealed
        vial, again in sand, in the first two hours with gentle fire, in
        the second with stronger, in the third yet more violent, and
        increased until the sand will hiss: and our <i>arsenic</i> will
        again be sublimated, with starry rays being sent forth. And
        since a large quantity is required of this, augment it thus:
        Take some of this six ounces, and of the purest filings of Luna
        one ounce and a half, and let it be an amalgam, and let it be
        digested in a sealed vial in hot ashes, until all the Luna is
        dissolved, and converted into <i>arsenical</i> water. Take of
        this prepared spirit one ounce and a half, put it in a closed
        vial of hot ashes, and it will ascend and descend; which heat
        should be continued until it no longer sweats, but lies at the
        bottom, having the color of ashes. Thus the matter is dissolved
        and putrefied. Take of this ashy matter one part, and of the
        aforementioned water half a part, mix them and let them sweat in
        a glass as before, which will happen in about eight days. When,
        thereafter, the ashy earth begins to whiten, take it out, and
        let it be imbibed with five washings of its lunar water, and be
        digested as before. Let it be imbibed the third time with five
        ounces of the same water, and coagulated as before, for eight
        days. The fourth imbibition requires seven ounces of the lunar
        water, and once the sweating is ended this preparation is
        finished. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the white work. Take of this white
        earth twenty-one drachmas. Of lunar water, fourteen drachmas. Of
        the calx of purest Luna, ten drachmas. Let them be mixed on
        marble, and committed to coagulation until they harden. Imbibe
        it with three parts of its own water, until it had drunk up this
        potion, and repeat this until it flows without smoke on a
        glowing copper plate. Then you will have a tincture for the
        white, which you can increase in the aforementioned manner. For
        the red, calx of sol, a stronger fire must be applied. And this
        is a work of more or less four months. Thus says he. This should
        be compared with the writings of the Arab philosopher, in which
        he describes the <i>arsenical</i> material in more detail... </p>

It







        is not only by the common operations of mining and digging in
        the profundities of the earth that it is possible to obtain
        Gold. It is quite within the powers of Art to imitate Nature in
        this matter, for Art perfects Nature in this as in many other
        things. We propose to provide in this place an account of a
        formal experiment, the worth of which has been tested over and
        over again, and has in fact become little less than familiar
        among operators in the pursuit of the Grand Work. In order to
        perform it a large crucible must be provided, and it must be of
        such a quality as will be able to resist the action of intense
        heat. This crucible must be set over a burning furnace, and at
        the bottom of the vessel there must be strewn Powder of
        Colophony (a kind of resin) to about the thickness of the little
        finger. Above this undermost layer there must be another layer
        of Fine Powder of Iron --- that is, the Finest Iron Filings ---
        which shall be of the same thickness. Subsequently, the filings
        must be covered with a little Red Sulphur. Then the fire in the
        furnace must be increased till the iron filings have passed into
        a liquid condition. The next operation is to throw in Borax ---
        that kind which is made use of by goldsmiths for melting gold.
        To this must be added a like quantity of Red <i>Arsenic</i>,
        and as much Pure Silver as will be equivalent to the weight of
        the Iron Filings. Let the entire composition undergo coction by
        driving the furnace, taking care at the same time not to inhale
        the steam, on account of the <i>arsenic</i> in the vessel. Take
        then another crucible into which, by inclining the first vessel,
        you must pour the cocted matter, having previously stirred it
        effectually with an iron spatula. Proceed in such a manner that
        the composition will flow into the second crucible in a purified
        state, and devoid of recremental matter. By means of the Water
        of Separation, the Gold will be precipitated to the bottom. When
        it has been collected, let it be melted in a crucible, and the
        result will be good Gold, which will repay all pains and expense
        which have been devoted to its production. This chemical secret
        is contained in the ‘<i>Hermetic Cabinet</i>’, and the facility
        with which the experiment can be performed has led many persons
        to undertake it. The authority cited in support of it is no less
        than that of the most learned Basil Valentine, who also affirms
        that the operation of the Grand Work of the Philosophers can be
        performed in less than three or four days, that the cost should
        not exceed three or four florins, and a few earthen vessels are
        sufficient for the whole experiment. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompholix</i> <b>---</b> Concerning this
        substance and the varieties of the same, see Dioscorides, who
        seems to confound Pompholix, Spodon, and Antispodon. In the
        first place, Pompholix is the same as that which is called white
        nothing or nil by vendors of medicines. Hence the proverb that
        nothing is good for the eyes They also call it White
        Pompholigum, which is coarser. On the other hand. Spodium is
        what the chemists call Black Pompholix… Pompholix is a Metallic
        Ash, which produced upon the tops or walls of furnaces, or of
        huts where there are extinguished furnaces. This Ash varies with
        the metals and the place of production. Grey Pompholix is
        obtained from Pyrites rather than from Stone… That which adheres
        to the tops and walls of furnaces Spodion. On the other hand,
        that which hangs from the top is Pompholix differing from the
        first in whiteness and polish. Dioscorides states that
        difference is specific, not generic. Spodon is: (1) Black, (2)
        Heavy, (3) Full of Straws, (4) Swept from the floors of
        Laboratories. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompholix is White like a Bubble, or like
        that Greek vessel of globular shape from which it obtains its
        name. It is fat, light, and pure, and is produced on the top of
        furnaces. There are, however, properly speaking, two kinds of
        Pompholix: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Somewhat thick, and of a copperish hue.
        Its proper name is grey nothing. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Exceeding white, of the highest polish.
        Produced either in perfecting Copper, when the Cadmia purposely
        strewn upon the surface is rubbed off; or from Cadmia melted by
        means of bellows. Dioscorides gives a lengthy description of the
        method. The thin and very light matter which finds its way to
        the top of the furnace and adheres to the walls and roof is
        Pompholix, but the heavier substance which betakes itself to the
        lower parts is Spodion. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dioscorides gives us further information as
        to genuine and adulterated Pompholix, the method of washing it,
        its virtues as an astringent, cooling, purifying, obstructing,
        and drying agent. He describes its torrefaction or roasting, and
        tells us from what substances it is preferably obtained ---
        namely, Gold, Silver, Lead, and Brass. Next to Pompholix from
        Cyprian Ore comes Pompholix from Lead. Pliny endorses these
        statements. Galen ascribes more powerful virtues to Pompholix
        than to Spodion. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Pompholix has a combination of
        virtues. Under Cadmia we have mentioned that Cadmia Botryitis,
        or Grape-shaped Cadmia, is called Arabian Tutty. Accordingly,
        that of Alexandria is called Dry or Solid. But Botryitis Cadmia
        is not the same substance as Cadmia, to which the Arabs and
        Serapion testify. For the Spodion here treated of is Tutty and a
        matter of importance. Botryitis is not Tutty. Dioscorides
        mentions Spodion and not Tutty. What is called Tutty by the
        Arabs and Pompholix by the Greeks is by us termed Spodion.
        Avicenna testifies to this fact. We can use Botryitis Cadmia
        instead of Tutty, that is, of Spodion, if it has been prepared.
        The difference between Botryitis and Capnitis Cadmia, and
        between Pompholix and Spodion, which are all made of the same
        material, depends upon the places where they are made. Cadmia
        Botryitis is made or deposited on the walls or the highest roofs
        of the furnaces. On the other hand, Capnitis is, properly
        speaking, obtained from the edges of the furnaces. Genuine
        Pompholix, or White Nothing, an exceedingly light Metallic Ash,
        is produced on the tops of furnaces, or even on the tops of the
        huts in which the furnaces are situated. If obtained from the
        mouth of the furnace, it is Cadmic Capnitis; if from the sides
        and roofs, it is Pompholix; that which adheres to the walls is
        Spodion. Young students should diligently observe these points.
        The Arabs distinguish two varieties of Tutty: Native Tutty ---
        White, Green, or Citrine --- found among minerals on the shores
        of the Indian Ocean; also Manufactured, of which we treat here.
        Observe also that besides the Sooty Spodion of Serapion,
        Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen, who says: I have never used
        Spodion, because I have always found Pompholix in abundance… </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompholix </i><b>---</b> (1) The Soot
        which is collected in Compartments of Furnace; (2) Pompholix
        from Silver; (3) Slimy, sticking to the walls where Silver is
        separated from bead. Yellow, Poisonous, Crystalline <i>Arsenic</i>;
        (4) From Mansfeld Copper; (5) That which is collected where
        Silver is separated from Copper; (6) Obtained from Furnaces
        where White Lead is smelted; (7) Purest White. Best Crystalline
        <i>Arsenic</i>; (8) That which is Solidified from Pieces of
        Stone roasted when Copper is cooked; (9) White Pompholix, termed
        by the Metallurgists White Nothing. </p>

          Realgar</i> is properly a Mineral Smoke, which has something
        of the nature of <i>Orpiment,</i> or <i>Arsenic</i>.
        Metaphorically, it is that poison of the body which generally is
        the cause of Ulcers. It is of four kinds, corresponding to the
        four elements, so there is the <i>Realgar</i> on the Surface of
        Water, the <i>Arsenical Realgar</i> of the Earth, the
        Terebinthine <i>Realgar</i> of Air, and that Saturnine
        Conjunction which is the <i>Realgar</i> of Fire. </p>

        But in this place we are dealing with a native metallic
        substance, which the Germans call <i>Orpiment, Realgar,
          Arsenical Orpiment</i>, Red Sulphur, Fire Sulphur, Red <i>Orpiment</i>.
        It is hot and dry in the second grade. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandarac is a Metal and a Purple Earth. It
        is found in the same metals as Native <i>Orpiment</i>, of which
        there is a species resembling this in smell, substance, and
        properties, though it differs in colour, corresponding therein
        to Cinnabar, which is red. Hence Pliny says that <i>Arsenic</i>
        is a compound of the same matter as Sandarach, meaning <i>Orpiment</i>
        by <i>Arsenic</i>… </p>

        made by means of <i>orpiment</i>, a process which invited the

        some men to work a great quantity of <i>orpiment</i>; by which
        operation perfect Gold was procured, but so small a quantity
        that the Emperor had reason to repent of his avarice... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is yet fresh in memory, that not long ago
        a Hollander, a goldsmith, of the name of Sommer resided in

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note further that Sulphur and Mercury or

        expressions should not seem strange to you, the Philosophers
        themselves call their Stone dragon, and serpent, which infects
        all things with its venom. Its substance in effect, and its
        vapour, are a poison, which the Philosopher knows how to change
        into an Theriac by the preparation, and by coction. The stone
        also is the Enemy of Metals, since it destroys them, and devours
        them. The Cosmopolite says that there is a metal, and a steel,
        which is as the water of metals, which has the power to consume
        the metals, that nothing but the radical moisture of the sun and
        of the moon can resist it. Take care however, not to confound
        here the Stone of the Philosophers, with the Philosophical
        Stone; because if the first like a veritable dragon, destroys,
        and devours the imperfect metals; the second as a sovereign

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this business then is nothing else but
        to create Sulphur of Nature and reduce the composition to its
        First Matter of the Metallick kind, for as Albertus saith in his
        <i>Book of Minerals</i>; “We must not so much alter or distance
        our Stone from the nature of Metals”. Know then that this
        Compound is the substance out of which ought to be drawn the
        Sulphur of nature by comforting it, and nourishing it in joining
        to this substance the Mineral Virtue, to the end it may be made
        a new Nature stript from all its Sulphureous terrestreity and
        corruption and all phlegmatic humidity, hindering digestion. It
        is further to be observed that according to the divers
        alterations or change of the one and the same Matter in
        digestion, divers names are imposed on it by the Philosophers
        according to its divers complexions, some have called it a
        coagulating pressure, some Azoc, <i>Arsenic</i>, others Album
        and tincture illuminating all bodies, some have called it,
        Philosophical Egg, for a Egg is composed of three parts, viz.,
        Shell, White, and the Yolk, so is compounded out Philosophical
        Egg, or Body, Soul and Spirit. Although in truth our Stone is
        but one thing according to Body, Spirit and Soul, but according
        to the divers reason and intentions of Philosophy, is now called
        one Thing, and then another, which Plato meant when he said,
        “The Matter flows infinitely or always, if the Form stay not its
        flux”, so is it Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, for
        there is Body, Soul and Spirit. There is also Sulphur, Mercury
        and <i>Arsenick</i>, for the Soul breathing, that is casting
        out its Vapours by <i>Arsenick</i> Works in conjoining Mercury
        of which philosophers say that the property of <i>Arsenick</i>
        is to breathe, or respire, the property of Sulphur is to
        coagulate or congeal Mercury, nevertheless this Sulphur, this <i>Arsenick</i>
        and this Mercury are not those the vulgar think of which are not
        those venomous Spirits the Apothecaries sell, but the Spirits of
        the Apothecaries are those vulgar Spirits, theirs are more of
        imperfection and corruption, to prejudice rather than repair
        imperfect Metals. Wherefore it cannot give perfection and
        incorruption to them, which perfection ought to be given by our
        Medium, Vainly therefore do those Sophisters work, who endeavor
        to make the Elixir, from such venomous Spirits full of
        corruption. For certainly, in no other thing is lodged the Truth
        of the Sovereign subtility of Nature, but in the three matters
        above said, to wit, Sulphur, <i>Arsenick</i> and Mercury
        Philosophical wherein the reparation and total perfection of

        namely, of the shell, the white and the yellow; likewise our
        physic is composed of Body, Soul, and Spirit, although our Stone
        is indeed one same thing, according to the Body, the Soul, and
        the Spirit; but according to diverse reasons and intentions of
        the Philosophers, it is presently called one thing, and anon
        another; which Plato has us to understand when he said that the
        Matter flows endlessly, that is to say, always, if the form does
        not arrest its flux. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is a Trinity in Unity, and a Unity
        in Trinity; because there are Body, Soul and Spirit; there are
        also Sulphur, Mercury and <i>Arsenic</i>: for the Sulphur,
        breathing, that is to say, casting out its vapor into <i>Arsenic</i>,
        operates by coupling the Mercury; and the Philosophers say that
        the property of <i>Arsenic</i> is to breath, and that the
        property of Sulphur is to coagulate, to congeal and to arrest
        the Mercury. Yet this Sulphur, <i>Arsenic</i> and mercury are
        not those venomous Spirits which the Apothecaries sell; but they
        are the Spirits of the Philosophers which should give our
        Medicine; whereas the other Spirits can give nothing for the
        perfection of Metals. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore in vain that labor those
        Sophists who make their Elixir from such venomous Spirits filled
        with corruption. For certainly the truth of the sovereign
        subtlety of Nature is in no other thing, than in these three
        Things --- viz., Sulphur, <i>Arsenic</i>, and Philosophic
        Mercury --- in which alone is the reparation and complete
        perfection of the Bodies, which must be purged and purified. </p>

        an earthy substance, by a strong commixtion that the one cannot
        be separated from the other, wherefore that watery substance is
        congealed with cold more after the action of heat and therefore
        they will be more fabrile or ductile, and the water only is not
        congealed but only with the earthly dryness which alters the
        wateryness, when as there is no unctuous moisture in them,
        because the congealing of them is of earthly dryness. Therefore
        they are not easily dissolved unless by the vehement action of
        the heat in them, according to which they are most easily
        commixt. But there are lesser and middle minerals which take not
        their original from Mercury, and of these are Salts which easily
        melt in moisture, as Alum, simple Salt, Salt Armonick, stony
        Salt and all kinds of salts. And surely they have virtue in

        may be obtained from all metals; but it is found in the highest
        perfection in gold and silver. Without the Sun and its shadow,
        the Moon, we can have no tingeing quicksilver, and he is foolish
        who attempts to accomplish our Magistery in their absence. On
        the other hand he who knows how to tinge quicksilver with the
        Sun and Moon is in possession of our arcanum which may become
        red sulphur, but at first is called white sulphur. Gold is the
        father, and silver the mother of the proximate substance of our
        Stone, for out of these bodies, prepared with their sulphur or <i>arsenic</i>,
        is our medicine elicited. It may, indeed, be possible to derive
        it from other bodies, but it is found nearer to the hand, and
        more easily, in quicksilver, which is the father of those lights
        and the root of all metals. Of this were they all made, and into
        the same all of them return. That which is now our Stone is not
        quicksilver, but once formed part of it, and it is this which
        imparts to it its brightness, preserves it from combustion, and
        is the cause of its perfection. Do not work with anything except

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arsenic</b></i> --- The arcane sense
        of the term refers it to the Mercury of the Philosophers, and at
        times to the matter of the philosophers when in the stage of
        putrefaction. It is stated, or supposed to be stated, in one of
        the Sibylline verses, that the name of the matter whence
        philosophical Mercury is extracted consists of nine letters. Of
        these, four are vowels and the rest consonants. One of the
        syllables is composed of three letters, the rest are of two.
        Hence it was concluded that <i>Arsenicum</i> was the name in
        question, more especially as the philosophers affirm that their
        matter is a deadly poison. However, the mater of the stone,
        according to other authorities, is not <i>arsenic</i>, though
        it is the matter of which <i>arsenic</i> and all mixed bodies
        are formed. Nor can the Mercury of the Sages be extracted from <i>arsenic</i>,
        for <i>arsenic</i> is sold by apothecaries and the minera of
        Mercury is found everywhere. The name has been given by some
        other writers to the matter in putrefaction, because then it is
        a most subtle and violent poison. Sometimes it refers to the
        volatile principle of the sages, which performs the office of
        female. It is their Mercury, their Moon, their Venus, their
        vegetable Saturn, their green Lion, etc. The <i>arsenic</i> of
        the philosophers whitens gold, even as the common <i>arsenic</i>
        whitens copper. </p>

        author of <i>Arcae Arca</i>. [<i>Theatr. Chym</i>.] from Lully
        and Mathesius tells us this… ‘That the matter (viz. of Metals)
        before it be coagulated into a metallick form, is like unto
        Butter made of the Cream of milk, which may be clamed or spread
        as Butter, which he (he meaneth Mathesius) calleth <i>Gur</i>,
        which I also (saith the Author quoted) have found in the Mines,
        where Nature hath produced Lead’. To ratifie this, and to put it
        forth of doubt, I shall relate what I my self have found, and
        how have some pounds of it by me. Inquiring after this <i>Gur</i>
        of all persons that I could hear of that wrought in Mines, there
        could some of them tell me, that often in the sudden breaking of
        some Stone, there would be a liquor spurt forth bright and
        shining, which they regarded not, because they knew no use nor
        benefit to be made of it, nor knew how to save or keep it. At
        last, meeting with an ingenious young man, whose Father had all
        his days been experienced in working in the Mines of Lead in
        Darbyshire, and he therein also had been trained up from his
        young years: one whom I had formerly much imployed in seeking
        and procuring for me, several sorts of Oars, Minerals, Stones
        and Earths, wherein I had found him very faithful and diligent;
        and discoursing with him about what liquid juices or waters he
        had ever observed in digging in the Mines, and instructing him
        in all that I understood of such things, according as I had read
        in Paracelsus, Helmont, or other writers, he thought the thing
        might be feasible. So according to my directions, providing
        himself with some wooden dishes to take with him, it was not
        very long ere he brought me a large quantity, found in a trench;
        where the he got good store of Lead Ore, such as the Miners
        account the best for their purpose; that is, such as will most
        easily run, or melt, and yield the most Lead: the description of
        which I shall here give as fully as I am able. It was (as he
        most faithfully affirmed) when he first broke the hard stone in
        which it was enclosed, some of it especially very thin and
        liquid, so as he could hardly preserve it; and the other as soft
        as Butter, and the inmost part of that he brought was as soft as
        Butter, to my touch and feeling, and the outside more hard; for
        the longer it lay to the air, the harder it grew. It was of a
        grayish or whitish colour, and would spread with ones finger
        upon a table, or smooth piece of wood, as like Butter as could
        be, but not so fatty, or greasie: and as Helmons saith, was like
        unto soft soap, but most of it something harder, for he had
        brought it near two miles to me, and though he had made haste,
        yet it had hardened by the air in the way. He also brought
        divers pieces of the hard grey stone, in whose holes and
        cavities it lay, and some of it in the midst, little pieces of
        lead, bright and pure Ore. So that if a man may give any
        reasonable conjecture, one would verily imagine tat the piece of
        Lead inclosed in this soft matter, did in continuance of time,
        change, or ripen it into its own Nature; which I will not
        positively affirm, but commend it to further trial and inquiry,
        for there had need be any careful experiments, before an Opinion
        be raised from the. But I remember that the Colliers and those
        that seek for Coal-mines, find in their boring or other working,
        such matter as they call Crow-stone, Coal-stone, and Soap-stone;
        the last of which is a black substance like fat Clay, and which
        (as the <i>Gur</i>) spread like Butter, but will soon harden in
        the air, into an hard mater that will hardly be cut with a
        knife, and somewhat harder then the other by: which both make me
        more and more admire the skill and knowledge of Paracelsus and
        Helmont, and to wonder at our ignorance in these things. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An observation agreeable to this (as I
        conceive) that I have related of mine own experience, is that of
        Helmont, which he gives us thus… ‘For it often happeneth that a
        Mine-man in the Pits breaking stones, the wall is opened and
        shews a chink from whence a water hath flowed of a somewhat
        whitish greenness: which by and by hath thickened, like soft
        Soap (I call it <i>Bur</i>) and forthwith the soemwhat greenish
        paleness being changed, it groweth yellowish, or whitish, or
        more fully greenish. This I would have the Reader to consider
        seriously of, in comparing it with the former relation; and to
        note, that whereas he calls it <i>Bur</i>, I suspect the Print
        is false, and that it ought to read <i>Gur</i>. </p>
