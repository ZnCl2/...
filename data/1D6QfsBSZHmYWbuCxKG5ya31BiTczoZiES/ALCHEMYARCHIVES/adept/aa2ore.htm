              size="-0">The Moray process is a prime example of what is
              possible. In 1950, Thomas H. Moray was approached with a
              request to investigate the possibility of improving the
              extraction of uranium ores. As a matter of course, the
              Moray Research Institute (MRI) proceeded by bombarding the
              ore in an "environment" with x-rays as high as 24 MeV
              before attempting to extract the values. The average ore
              contained 0.23% uranium oxide. After irradiation, the ore
              yielded from 7-75% uranium oxide!</font></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">In 1953 the MRI proposed that the Atomic Energy
              Commission (AEC) investigate such a project for the
              "aging" of atomic ores by a "breeding type reaction with
              high-energy particles or x-rays in the presence of a
              proper environment." The AEC declined to grant a contract.<b>(7,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">In 1958, the MRI adapted its process to the
              augmentation of precious metal ores. the Moray process
              uses three main categories of ores, containing traces to a
              few hundredth of an ounce of gold and silver per ton: 1)
              low-grade unprocessed gold ore; 2) mill tailings ---
              especially advantageous; this material costs very little,
              is ground already, and yields excellent results. High
              grade ores seem to be less adaptable to this process; they
              yield much less of an increase in values than do low grade
              ores:</font></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">"Early tests gave yields of 50-100 oz. gold/ton
              ore. While virtually no gold or silver values can be
              determined in the raw ore, after irradiation and drying
              the gold and silver can be identified by standard fire
              assay or any other normal determination methods...</font></font></font>

              that upon completion of irradiation the samples will have
              to be disposed of expediently." <b>(9)</b></font></font></font>

              size="-0">The Moray process utilizes an "environmental
              solution", developed in 1949. Aging became a problem as
              chemical reactions continued to take place due to
              hydration and temperature changes. By 1961, the MRI had
              refined several formulas of solutions, one or more of
              which work well with most ore types and do not require any
              aging. They can be used immediately after mixing and can
              be stored without adverse effects. Their cost is
              approximately $50/100 gallons (the volume of solution
              required to process one ton of ore). The solution is
              heated to an unspecified "elevated temperature” during
              irradiation.</font></font></font> </p>

              size="-0">"The environmental material consists of a
              combination of chemicals whose atomic numbers add up to
              the atomic number of silver or gold and yield silver and
              gold upon irradiation [The formulas include arseno- and
              iron-pyrites in alkaline solution]. Antimony has peculiar
              properties -- it has floating electrons which come in very
              handy. It is believed that this environment furnishes
              particles similar to the cosmic ray reaction on the
              atmosphere. Research work indicates that the radiation
              must be composed of both high-speed electrons and x-rays.
              Consistent results under controlled methods were obtained
              with the addition of a catalyst (a flux or reduction
              agent, an environment) combined with bombardment of the

              of low atomic weights to those of the noble metals. A
              solution was prepared --- made up of Baker’s reagent
              quality chemicals of the highest purity and water,
              distilled by boiling. These bottled chemicals list the
              trace materials which might be existent in them. Gold did

              atoms of higher atomic number than 19 (K) were present in
              quantity in this solution. Silver has the atomic number of
              47, and gold 79. This prepared solution of pure chemicals
              in glass containers is irradiated by high energy photons
              for about one minute and then by evaporation the residue
              was dried and sent to an independent assayer for

              formation of gold to be in small crystals also... The
              process we have described is in reality a crystal growing
              bath activated by irradiation. As the gold atoms come into
              being by transmutation, they become gregarious, which
              results in the crystal formation.</font></font></font> </p>

              melted in bronze crucibles under the influence of 110
              kilovolts. Dunikovski claimed to have perfected a process

              was charged with fraud. He demonstrated his process to the
              court, but the results were ambiguous and insufficient to
              prove his innocence. Dunikovski was sentenced to four
              years imprisonment, but his attorney secured his release
              after two years. Dunikovski relocated to San Remo and

              located between about 1400 and 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>)
              because they lack a <i>d</i>-orbital electron. Hudson and
              associates developed a method to recover ORMEs and convert
              them into their metallic forms. While it is not a
              transmutation of one element into another (but rather, the
              conversion of an allotrope into the common visible form of
              the elements), the extraction and conversion of ORMEs to
              metal may explain the claims of some other experimenters.
              Certain ores, particularly sodic and calcidic plagioclase,

              size="-0">In the 1990s, Joe Champion announced a variety
              of methods of transmutations of black sands by thermal
              burns, melts and kinetic methods. He was convicted of
              fraud in Arizona after being accused by an irate investor
              who failed to achieve satisfactory results. Other
              researchers (including the physicists Bockris and
              Sundaresan, 1994) validated his processes, however, so the
              question remains open for experiment.</font></font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">The process was developed from a method of
              "growing gold" in an electrolytic cell that was originally
              developed by Dr. Walter Lussage, a Czechoslovakian
              geologist (d. 1977). Dr. Lussage revealed his process to
              Mr. Jack Keller, who taught it to Joe Champion in 1989.
              Champion subsequently developed the method further.</font></font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">The original formula is quite simple: black sand
              (90 gr), charcoal (90 gr), and sodium nitrate (270 gr),
              pulverized to 200 mesh and mixed thoroughly. The reagents
              must be pulverized separately to avoid ignition. The
              mixture is ignited with a torch; it burns about 90
              seconds, reaching a temperature of about 700<sup>o</sup>
              C. In one assay, the mixture contained 0.18 mg Au and 1.35
              mg Ag before ignition; after ignition it contained 212.7
              mg Au and 856.8 mg Ag.</font></font></font> </p>

              (30 gr), mercury chloride (100 gr), lead oxide (50 gr),
              silver (5 gr), and calcium oxide (30 gr).</font></font></font>

              mineral coal (1 kg), sodium nitrate (3 kg), lead (300 gr),
              silver (200 gr), and mercury chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1

              sodium nitrate (900 gr) and powered silver (500 gr). When
              an inductive furnace was employed, the formula needed to
              be modified: black sands (100 gr), charcoal (350 gr),
              sodium nitrate (150 gr), silver (50 gr), and copper powder
              (50 gr).</font></font></font> </p>

              ignition period. After the ignition was completed, the
              temperature was raised to 2000<sup>o</sup> C for 90
              minutes. If necessary, borax or potassium nitrate was
              added to maintain fluidity of the mixture. When there was
              no more apparent reaction, the mixture was poured into a
              mold to cool, and the slag removed. Both the reaction
              mixture and the slag should be assayed.</font></font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">Another method was discovered in 1993, utilizing
              the kinetic energy of a ball mill with 40 kg of carbon
              steel balls. The liner must be made of iron-coated steel
              and the reagents must be thoroughly dry for this method to
              work properly. The ball mill also must have an airtight
              seal. 24% of the mineral weight should be ferric oxygen,
              which is required for the kinetic excitation transmutation
              to occur.</font></font></font> </p>

              size="-0">One of Champion's research associates, Greg
              Iseman (Mesa AZ), used a microwave digestion process to
              perform analyses of the formula; this method also produced
              transmutations.</font></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#330033"><font
              size="-0">"If the reaction mixture exceeds 15 kg, the
              yield is reduced because the transmutation cycle is too
              long and begins to produce base elements instead of
              precious metals. It was found necessary to add traces of
              the target elements to the starting mixture in order for
              the resonance of those elements (i.e., Au) to act as a
              "stopping agent".</font></font></font> </p>
