      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon
            after the phenomena of Cold Fusion (CF, discovered by B.
            Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischman in 1989) became widely
            replicated, researchers began to announce the anomalous
            production of elements, beginning with helium and tritium
            and continuing into the heavy atoms. By 1995 about 120
            papers had reported the production of tritium in experiments
            with palladium. For example, several papers on Low-Energy
            Transmutation (LET) were presented at a conference held at
            Texas A &amp; M University on June 19, 1995, as described
            below:</font></font> </p>

            Thomas Passell (Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto
            CA) gave an "Overview of the EPRI Program in Deuterided
            Metals" in which he noted:</font></font> </p>

            completion of the experiment, the three 6 mm diameter by 60
            mm Pd cathodes were found to be mildly radioactive. Upon
            analysis it was found that all three cathodes contained
            about 100 billion atoms of Ag, Pd, Rh, and (in one cathode)
            Ru isotopes having ratios unlike ratios that could have been
            obtained from bombardment by high energy deuteron or proton
            beams..." <b>(6, 7)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. T.
            Ohmori (Hokkaido Univ.) announced "Iron formation in gold
            and palladium cathodes", with the formation of Fe being a
            function of the excess heat produced. The ratio of Fe<sub>57</sub>
            to Fe<sub>54</sub> was much larger than is natural.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.
            John Dash (Portland State Univ.) made a "Microanalysis of Pd
            cathodes after electrolysis in aqueous acids" and found
            silver and cadmium in the active areas, plus concentrations
            of gold in spikes that protruded from the Pd electrodes. Cr,
            Fe and Ca were found in experiments with a Ti cathode.</font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr
            Robert Bush (Cal Poly) reported the "Electrolytically
            stimulated cold nuclear synthesis of strontium from
            rubidium" by proton capture that he accomplished with Prof.
            Robert Eagleton. The natural abundance ratio of Sr<sub>86</sub>
            to Sr<sub>88</sub> was changed by a factor of almost 22
            times. <b>(4)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr
            Reiko Notoya (Catalyst Research Center, Hokkaido) described

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T.
            Mizuno, <i>et al</i>., confirmed that reaction products
            with mass number ranging from 39 to 81, 104 to 136, and 177
            to 208 were produced by one month of high amperage
            electrolysis (0.2 to 0.6 A/cm<sup>2</sup>) with Pd cathodes
            in a heavy water solution at high pressure and high
            temperature. Isotopic distributions differed radically from
            the natural order. For example, the copper found in the
            cathode was 100% Cu<sup>63</sup>; no Cu<sup>65 </sup>was
            detected. Natural isotopic distribution varies by less than
            0.001% for copper (70% Cu<sup>63</sup>, and 30% Cu<sup>65</sup>).





            In general, heavy isotopes increased compared to the natural
            ratio, and light isotopes decreased in comparison. The
            phenomenon is highly reproducible; different isotope
            distributions are obtained, depending amperage. Even all
            impurities were accumulated in the cathode, the amount would
            be 10 to 100 times smaller than the total amount detected by
            Mizuno, <i>et al.</i> The shifts in the isotopic
            distribution cannot be explained away:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It
            must be concluded that some novel reactions occurred,
            resulting in the reactants which were found abundant in the
            electrolyte and electrode material. We assume that the
            cathode palladium was the starting point for these
            reactions, but is possible that impurities and other cell
            components such as Li, D<sub>2</sub>O, Pd, Pt, K, Na, Ca, B,
            C, Ag and Fe may have provided the starting material for the
            nuclear reactions..."</font></font> </p>

            was confirmed by several analytical methods that reaction

            a heavy water solution at high pressure, high temperature,
            and high current density for one month. These masses were
            composed of many elements ranging from hydrogen to lead.

            the past year we have been able to demonstrate that a plasma

            tritium from small palladium wires. In contrast to
            electrochemical hydrogen or deuterium loading of palladium,
            this method yields a reproducible tritium generation rate
            when various electrical and physical conditions are met.
            Small diameter wires (100-250 microns) have been used with
            gas pressures above 200 torr at voltages and currents of
            about 2000 V at 3-5 A. By carefully controlling the
            sputtering rate of the wire, runs have been extended to
            hundreds of hours allowing a significant amount (&gt;10's
            nCi) of tritium to accumulate... Tritium generation rates
            for deuterium-palladium foreground runs are up to 25 times

            metallurgical condition of palladium used in the
            experiments... CO<sub>2</sub> additions had a remarkable
            effect on the production of tritium... The effect seems to

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Experiments using 1-mm plastic and glass microspheres
            coated with single and multilayers of thin films of various
            metals such as palladium and nickel, used in a packed bed
            electrolytic cell (Patterson Power Cell) configuration,
            typically employing Pd and heavy or light water with various
            electrolytes such as Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and LiOH),
            have apparently produced a variety of nuclear reaction
            products... Following a two week electrolytic run, the Ni
            film was found to contain Fe, Ag, Cu, Mg, and Cr, in
            concentrations exceeding 2 atom % each, plus a number of
            additional trace elements. These elements were at the most,
            only present in the initial film and the electrolyte plus
            other accessible cell components in much smaller amounts.
            That fact, combined with other data, such as deviations from

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            disposition of nuclear waste is one of the most serious
            technical challenges facing humanity. Long-term storage is
            not acceptable, yet it is all that we can do with the mess
            at this time. Meanwhile, many physicists are developing
            methods to render nuclear waste inactive by various forms of
            transmutation.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            rapid transmutation of radioactive elements to stable
            daughter elements can be accomplished in several ways. The
            first such method was proposed by Dr. Radha Roy (Physics
            Dept, Arizona State Univ.) in 1979. He used a linear
            accelerator to generate x-rays that knocked nuclei from the
            target elements (Cesium-137 and Strontium-90), resulting in
            short-lived isotopes. His work received notice in the <i>New






              York Times</i> in 1982 (April 6 &amp; 13). Only 20 year
            later, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is developing a
            project for "Accelerator Transmutation of Waste". A
            prototype plant will be constructed within five years. Two
            US Patents have been granted for the transmutation of
            nuclear waste with thermal neutron flux: #5,160,696 and
            #4,721,596 to Charles Bowman and Richard Marriott, <i>et al</i>.,





            respectively.</font></font> </p>

            Scientists at Europe's CERN facility also are experimenting
            with 'sub-critical" nuclear reactions (they cease when not
            being triggered by a linear accelerator) that curtail
            radioactivity. The proposed European system has been named
            "Energy Amplifier" by Carlo Rubbia, the Nobel Prize winning
            physicist who designed it. The CERN website offers this
            explanation for their efforts:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Intense linear accelerators would allow transmutation of
            long-lived nuclear waste which rapidly decays to become
            harmless or alternatively provide the beam which drives the
            Energy Amplifier, a failsafe form of nuclear reactor using
            relatively innocuous thorium as its fuel.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            CERN Energy Amplifier would work by inserting tubes of
            radioactive isotopes into a block of lead. Protons fired
            into the lead by a linear accelerator would generate
            high-energy neutrons that would fission the target waste.
            When the neutrons pass through the resonant energy levels of
            the target isotopes, they trigger transmutation reactions.
            The molten lead also would serve to cool the system by its
            passage through a heat exchanger, and the waste heat could
            be used to generate electricity. The corrosive lead will be
            bubbled with oxygen to allow the formation of a protective
            coat of oxide on the reactor walls. The system has been
            criticized as too complex, and to date the researchers have
            only performed simulations and conducted a few experiments
            on isolated aspects of the system. For example, the CERN
            scientists have transmuted Technetium-99 in a lead block.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            Americans and Europeans refuse to cooperate on the project;
            each group claims the other has copied their ideas.
            Fortunately, there are several other, simpler ways to solve
            the problem.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
            early 1990s, physicist Kenneth Shoulders received five US
            Patents for his High Density Charge Cluster (HDCC), "a
            relatively discrete, self-contained, negatively charged,
            high density state of matter... [a bundle of electrons that]
            appears to be produced by the application of a high
            electrical field between a cathode and an anode" (i.e., 2-10
            kv at the tip of a sharply pointed electrode). It can also
            be described as "a spherical monopole oscillator". Shoulders
            has given it the name "Electrum Validum" (EV), meaning
            "strong electron", from the Greek "elektron" (electronic
            charge) and the Latin "valere" (to be strong, having power
            to unite). EVs have been credited with accomplishing the
            aforementioned cold fusion transmutations. <b>(19)</b></font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Shoulders also invented a method of Plasma-Injected
            Transmutation for the remediation of nuclear waste by EVs.
            They apparently function as a collective accelerator with
            sufficient energy to inject a large group of nuclei into a
            target and promote nuclear cluster reactions. The
            composition of EVs allowsfor the inclusion of some 10<sup>5</sup>
            nuclides. Ions can be added to EVs until the net charge
            becomes positive. Such EVs are called NEVs (Nuclide-EVs).
            Shoulders states:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            NEV acts as an ultra-massive, negative ion with high
            charge-to-mass ratio. This provides the function of a simple
            nuclear accelerator. Such nuclear reactions are
            fundamentally an event involving large numbers and not one
            of widely isolated events working at an atomic level."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEVs
            can be produced by mechanical energy that is stored in and
            released from a brittle metal lattice by fracto-emission of
            electrons. In the case of acoustic/aqueous systems, they are
            generated by charge separation in a collapsing bubble.
            Analysis of palladium foils after they were struck by NEVs
            has revealed increased quantities of Mg, Ca, Si, Ga and Au.
            Locally produced fracto-emission induced by NEV strikes
            contribute a considerable amount of energy to the reactions
            and can initiate a "wildfire" propagation of energy which
            either triggers or fuels the events. These events occur
            within a few tenths of a picosecond. The first step is a
            loading process that renders the material brittle. Then a
            very rapid fracture generates a NEV, compression-loaded with
            available nucleons (i.e., 100,000 deuterons in an
            electrolytic cold fusion cell). The NEV is accelerated into
            the parent material by the applied voltage which, though it
            is only in the kilovolt range, has a velocity equivalent to
            megavolts due to the mechanism of the acceleration in the
            fracture. Shoulders offers an <i>ad hoc</i> explanation of
            these results as being "due largely to a <i>nuclear cluster
              reaction</i> having an unknown form of coherence." Ken
            Shoulders has demonstrated the complete elimination of
            radioactivity in high-level nuclear material. <b>(14, 20)</b></font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
            researchers (Rod Neal, Stan Gleeson, "The Cincinatti Group",
            William Barker, etc.) also applied for patents on similar
            applications. The Neal-Gleeson Process has been shown to
            stabilize naturally radioactive solutions of thorium and
            uranium compounds up to 70% within a few hours in an
            electrochemical reactor. Thorium can be fissioned into
            mercury and neon. Valve metals (whose oxides emit electron)
            can be excited to produce galvano-luminescence in aqueous
            solution. When the charge gradient exceeds a critical
            threshold (i.e., 1 million volts), sparks are produced in
            the form of charge clusters that are believed to be the
            active mechanism in this method of transmutation.</font></font>

            "Because there is a close agreement between the reduction in
            thorium and the reduction of radioactivity of the thorium
            daughter products, it is assumed that the Neal-Gleeson
            Process has about the same capability to change both thorium
            nuclei and the nuclei of the daughter products into other
            elements which are not radioactive...</font></font> </p>

            process which can cause the higher atomic number elements to
            be split into smaller elements appears to be a desirable
            method by which certain radioactive elements can be handled.
            It is highly desirable to be able to select process-control
            parameters so that only stable daughter nuclei of the parent
            elements are produced. In this way, the radioactivity of
            today's highly radioactive slurries can be ameliorated."</font></font>

            "Sparking at the electrode is necessary but not sufficient

            known as "Brown's gas") that is burned in a 2:1 ration.
            Since the early 1980s, long before cold fusion was
            discovered, Yull Brown claimed to be able to transmute
            radioactive material into inert forms by fusing it in the

            Beginning in 1958, Russian geophysicist Dr. Georgiy S. Rabzi
            developed methods of transmutation that combined
            geo-electric and artificial fields and temperature control
            to direct transmutation in solids and liquids. For example,
            a 99.5% Pb was treated at 650<sup>o</sup> C to yield up to
            3% Ag, plus Cd and Ge (15 March 1994). No radioactivity was
            observed in any of the experiments. At the ICCF-5 meeting,
            Dr Rabzi claimed that his "natural cold fission" is a safe
            method with which to stabilize nuclear waste.</font></font>

            Numerous reports in the literature of physics describe
            deviations (from 0.1 to 5%) from the standard constant decay
            rates of natural radioactivity, some by extra-nuclear
            influences (including the human mind). Physicists Elizabeth
            Rauscher, Glen Rein, and associates have investigated the
            interactions of Co<sub>60</sub> with non-Hertzian energies
            such as the scalar fields generated by the "Smith Coil" (a
            Caduceus-wound coil invented by Canadian engineer Wilbur B.
            Smith in the 1960s). When energized (3 mA/5 W), The
            non-inductive Smith Coil (8.2 ohms) reduced the background
            radiation by 97% (from 0.5 mR/hr to 0.0015 mR/hr). Yet when
            applied to Co<sub>60</sub>, the radioactivity <u>increased</u>
            from 150 to 250 mR/hr! <b>(11, 18)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
            possibilities may exist for the transmutation of nuclear
            waste. For example, it is reasonable to hope that the
            legendary Philosophers' Stone is capable of performing this
            feat, but the Stone remains a gift of God, who determines
            when and to whom it is bestowed (despite the objections of
            conventional physicists). A few exotic human technologies
            are immediately available for research and development, such
            as the radionic transmutations demonstrated by the amazing
            DeLaWarr Camera. Tom Beardon and others have recommended the
            use of scalar interferometry to extract energy from the
            nucleus in a gentle manner, or by outright
            dematerialization.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            radioactivity of elements also can be <u>increased</u> by
            relatively simple means. The German Dr. Alois Gaschler
            applied for a British patent in 1925 (Specification 239,509)
            for the enrichment of uranium:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This
            invention relates to a process of and means for transforming
            elementary atoms particularly of uranium and thorium with a
            view to hasten their spontaneous disintegration and to
            increase their radioactivity, and the invention consists in
            subjecting small quantitites of the metal in a vaporizing
            chamber to very high pressure and temperature and in
            subjecting the vaporized metal vapour to the electrostatic
            or electrolytic effect of strong, preferably direct electric
            currents.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Successful experiments have been made with an electric
            energy of about 100 kilowatt-seconds per gramme of uranium
            or thorium. The electric current can be used for the heating
            of the metal as weall as for the electric splitting up of
            the atoms.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In
            order to generate a very high pressure during the heating of
            the metal and to obviate heat and light radiation as far as
            possible, a thin filament of metal, weighing about 1 gramme,
            is placed in a duct in a massive block of quartz or granite
            or other refractory mineral insulating substance. The two
            ends of the filament are extended through the block and
            clamped between two thick metal plates which at the same
            time act as closures for the duct. Terminals are provided on
            the metal plate for connection to the electric circuit. The
            duration of the individual electric shocks is generally
            about 1-2 seconds. After the conclusion of the process, the
            evaporated metal is recovered mechanically or chemically and
            will be found to be much more radioactive than the original
            substance.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            more the separated metal vapour comes into contact with the
            pole surfaces and the higher the electric pressure, the
            greater is the transformation effect. It is advisable,
            therefore, to employ a heating circuit of low voltage and
            high amperage, and a separate electrolyzing circuit of
            relatively low amperage and high voltage. For this purpose a
            pair of electrodes having a large surface is arranged in the
            vaporizing chamber and connected to the high-pressure
            circuit which, in order to produce a high resistance,
            includes a Crooke's or Geissler tube.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When
            artificial metals are to be produced on a large scale, the
            use of a filament is not practicable as it requires too
            frequent replacement. It is therefore better to supply
            metallic vapour through a valve into the space containing
            the electric arc and to withdraw it therefrom in the same
            way."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.
            Gaschler gave more details of his process in an article
            published in the journal <i>Nature</i>:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            behavior of uranium and thorium and their salts in the
            electric arc and in the glow discharge has been examined. In
            no case could there be observed an alteration in the
            radioactivity or in the chemical activity. A perceptible
            transmutation effect was, however, unexpectedly found when
            strong rushes of momentary high-tension currents were sent
            through a narrow fused quartz tube provided with tungsten
            electrodes and containing mercury and uranium oxide. The
            tube was fixed vertically in a stand, so that the mercury
            filled the lower part of the tube and one tungsten electrode
            was completely covered by it. On the surface of the mercury
            was a relatively thin coating of uranium oxide which had
            been carefully freed from radioactive by-products,
            especially from uranium-X, before it was introduced into the
            quartz tube. The sparking distance between the tungsten
            electrode and the mercury-uranium oxide electrode was about
            15 cm. The intensity of the electric discharge varied
            between 0.3 and 0.4 amps.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under
            the influence of repeated electric discharges during about
            30 hours, relatively strong and increasing radioactivity [b
            and l rays] showed itself. The b and l ray activity varied
            between 1.4 and 20 times the radioactivity of an equally
            large amount of uranium oxide in equilibrium with its decay
            products, and increased proportionally to the energy applied
            and to the time.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One
            obtains an even greater proportion of uranium X if one makes
            the electric discharges pass within a thick-sided quartz or
            porcelain vessel between a tungsten point and mercury
            covered with a thin coat of vaseline and uranium oxide. This
            coating possesses such a high electric resistance that, even
            when applying the highest tensions which can be obtained,
            one is obliged to diminish greatly the sparking distance in
            order to obtain a discharge. This proceeding offers the
            advantage that the energy is concentrated into a very small
            space. Consequently one can show, after half an hours work,
            the production of relatively large quantities of uranium X.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            production of uranium X considerably in excess of that
            produced by spontaneous decay is to be explained only by the
            fact that, under the influence of the electric force, an
            acceleration of the radioactive transmutation of uranium
            takes place." <b>(23)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
            1950s, Thomas H. Moray developed a method for enriching
            uranium by high-energy bombardment. He proceeded by treating
            the ore (in a chemical solution) with x-rays (up to 24 MeV).
            The average ore contained 0.23% uranium oxide. After
            irradiation, the ore yielded from 7-75% uranium oxide! In
            1953, Moray proposed that the Atomic Energy Commission
            investigate the "aging" of atomic ores by a "breeding type
            reaction with high-energy particles or x-rays in the
            presence of a proper environment." The AEC declined to grant
            a contract.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Fortunately, the technologies invented by Gaschler and Moray
            are dormant. Meanwhile, it is imperative that we develop
            every possible pathway to the deactivation of nuclear waste
            and weapons.</font></font> </p>
