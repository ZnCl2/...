          can be prepared in two general ways: "wet" (solutions) and
          "dry" (fusions). Much has been written about the wet way; it
          is long, dangerous, tedious and expensive. The Short, Dry, or
          Royal Path, the Ars Brevis, is little known, having been
          mentioned only a few times in the literature of Alchemy. It
          can be quick, simple and easy, but it is also very dangerous
          and difficult to control. Here are most of the explicit&nbsp;

          and the mercury, which they knew how to extract from the less
          compacted metals, for a female: not as an easier process, but
          to find out the possibility of making the stone this way; and
          have succeeded, giving this method more openly to conceal the
          true confection, which is most easy and simple.</font> </p>

            Book of his <i>Politics</i> </b>--- There is a double way
          in this art according to the Philosophers, that is ---
          universal and particular. The universal way is easy and rare,
          and it is that which is brought forth from true and natural
          beginnings, by which a speedy and reformative virtue doth
          presently and in a moment hardens Mercury, and it tinctureth
          any metal that is duly prepared, into true Gold or Silver.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the second way is called
          particular and it is hard and laboursome. Note this, although
          Alchemy in the universal way be partly natural and partly
          artificial, yet it is more natural than otherwise, because by
          nature no strange or foreign thing is brought in the way of
          true Alchemy, for nature hath whereon to work because actives
          are joined to passives by a competent union and application,
          but the rest nature worketh by herself.</font> </p>

            of Arnoldus</b> --- I demand in what time this blessed Stone
          may be made, to which it is answered as a certain author
          Lelius the Philosopher witnesses, that his magistery was
          finished in eight days, and that another did it in seven days,
          and another in three months, and some in four months, and some
          in half a year, and some in the space of a whole year, and
          Maria says she did it in three days. To this I say that the
          cause of diversity, that is of shortness and length of time,
          might be defect in the virtue of the water of Mercury or
          because it worketh of Sol and Luna. And some of the
          Philosophers added more and some less. But Sol is fixed and
          not flying, and with that only did they work.</font> </p>

          all the ancient Philosophers, that is, that thou shalt know
          well to separate this oil from the wateriness and thou shalt
          labour in the manner of the mixtion of them, and thou shalt be
          able to make the Stone in 30 days, but this is not necessary

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly there is now,
          besides the work of three years, a work of three months, three
          weeks, three days, and, surpassing all of these, three hours.
          Mary the Prophetess was trained in this last work; a
          philosopher of keen intellect, or a well-trained artisan, will
          be able to investigate what she has learned from her
          discussions with the Philosopher Aros. In addition, there are
          other works, called the work of one natural day, one month,
          one year, and nine months. Anyone who does not know the
          distinctions among these and other such things lays claim to
          this saying: "He should take his hand off the reins." And
          though all these aforesaid works are to be understood only by
          the time of operation from first to last, nevertheless it can
          happen that other works are mixed in with them, and then both
          operations, antecedent and consequent, are included in the
          timespan listed above. But since the purpose here has been
          merely to give you a casual warning about these matters, there
          is no need to dwell on them further...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What follows is how the
          Philosophers multiplied their work in the moist path, and
          perhaps also by the same token in the dry path. Multiplication
          takes place in quantity as well as in quality, always with ten
          parts of its water or of philosophical mercury duplex and so
          on to infinity. The first time it does not tinct, but if it is
          put in fire the second time it is perfected in two months
          time, and one part tincts only ten parts. If you put it in
          fire a third time, it is finished in three weeks and one part
          tincts a hundred parts. If you put it in fire a fourth time,
          it is perfected in three days, and one part tincts a thousand
          parts. After that a work of multiplication is completed in
          three days at a time, and this is the work of three days.</font>

      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pontanus had his knowledge
          from Artephius, therefore followed him, having read and
          understood him, except that Artephius worked by the long humid
          way, but Pontanus by the dry short way, and Mr. F. believes
          that it can be done in a very Short Time, probably sooner than
          we are aware of.</font> </p>

          name="7beu"></a> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we now wish to proceed further, we must
        now go on to Paracelsus’ School of Work and to the brief
        passages which follow, as are readily to be noted and learned
        from his <i>Scriptis</i>. Then we desired to learn from the <i>Subjectum



          Materiae vel Tincturae</i>, which is reported clearly enough
        and shown with the fingers, so he also set up thereby the
        welcome preparations and said that from one (of the materials
        noted) two would result, namely, sulfur and mercury, since one
        of them (mercury) gives the body, on earth, wherein we plant the
        seeds, <i>i.e</i>., the Sulfur of the Sun, which sulfur is
        called the Blood of the Red Lion, while the mercury is called
        the Gluten of the White Eagle. He further stated that when the
        two coagulated together, then the tincture thus prepared was
        ready to be used. This is, indeed, a shorter way of preparation,
        though it gives poorer and inferior results... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One also sees how the work is brought to
        completion from a material in an oven, glass container, or other
        type of receptacle, in one experiment after another, by using
        increased amounts to heat. And, even though the work and the art
        by you yourself is completely inferior in quality, the
        philosophers have also pointed out that, “It is wife’s work and
        children’s play”. Even so, it still requires a well-qualified
        artisan to be the fire-master. Moreover, the work may be
        completed easily enough without danger in 16 weeks... </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Art is noble, brief, and easy. It
        requires one thing, which everybody knows. It is in many things,
        yet it is one thing. It is found everywhere, yet it is most
        precious. You must fix it and tame it in the fire; you must make
        it rise, and again descend. When conjunction has taken place,
        straightway it is fixed. Then it gives riches to the poor and
        rest to the weary. The operation is good, if it become first dry
        and then liquid, and what Rebis (Twothing) is, you will find in
        the practical part of this work. </p>

      <p><b><i>The Natural Philosopher’s Tincture</i></b> ---
        Theophrastus also means that, when you have obtained the two
        things by the short method, viz., the rosy blood and the Eagle’s
        white gluten, you shall thereto add nothing foreign… </p>
      <p><b><i>The Natural Philosopher's Tincture</i> [ Alexander von
          Suchten ]</b> --- This is the first process of our
        Philosophical Birth, the Returning into the Mother’s Womb,
        whereby the Rule of God is followed, and the first precepts of
        chemists are fulfilled, viz., the Reduction into Pimary Matter,
        into the Three Natural Principles, i.e., Animated Spirit,
        Mercury, and Sulphureous Vapour of Earth... which is nothing
        less than... The Process with Double Smoke of Paracelsus. But
        the above method entailed heavy expenses and much time and
        labour, all of which the Ancient Sages could have avoided, and
        obtained the Lion’s treasure by a shorter cut, had they enquired
        into the matter as diligently as Theophrastus. </p>
      <p>Now, I wot there is no one who would not wish to know this
        shorter method; and that you may not have to complain of
        Theophrastus, he shews you another short way, admonishing you
        also to let the above tedious process be, and to take from the
        Lion nought but his rosy blood, and from the Eagle the white
        gluten. These two bodies you must coagulate together and bring
        into one body, as it were male and female seed. </p>
      <p>Now, someone might object thus. Dear Theophrastus, that is the
        old story which I have heard long ago. The Ancients took nothing
        more than the Lion’s blood and water, and coagulated them. Yet
        you tell me the same is a brief way to obtain the aforesaid two
        Mercurial Substances, with little labour and in a short time. </p>
      <p>Well, that is true so far. Theophrastus is not so clear here as
        he might be. But you may easily imagine what the mode of
        preparation must be if you have diligently studied
        Theophrastus’s other books and preparations, and are otherwise
        experienced in Chemical labours. You will then find that
        Chemistry, in the preparation of all arcana (secrets), has two
        methods, viz., Distillation and Extraction. Whatsoever is to be
        prepared by Chemistry and brought into its Arcanum, its
        Tincture, or Quintessence (in which is he power and virtue of
        all creatures), or is to be cleansed from impeding impurities,
        that must be done by Distillation or Extraction (which is the
        same as Solution). There is no other means. As Bernhardus says:
        “The King never goes forth except the Fountain attract him”. </p>
      <p>Now, having already heard that he rejects the tedious process
        of much distillation and purification by reason of its expense,
        etc., you perceive that he must have used the only other means,
        viz., Extraction by Solution. </p>
      <p>According to Calid, son of Jazichus: “Solution is the
        Extraction of the Interior of Things to their Superficies, so
        that the hidden become manifest”. Hence his (Theo.’s) meaning is
        this: When you of one thing have made two --- or have taken two
        things differently constituted by Nature --- let the old process
        alone; take from the Lion his blood only --- i.e., cut out his
        heart with his own sharp spear --- or as Bernhardus says: “Slay
        the King with his own sharp, poisonous Mercurial Water”. In
        plain words: Extract but from the earth its Tincture or Arcanum,
        and the blood, the sunshine, the dry spirit immediately all
        distills over. By such extraction or solution more will be done
        in a few hours than the Ancient Sages could effect in six
        months. By the above process the whole work may be completed in
        ten or twelve months, in which time the Ancients could barely
        achieve the first step --- i.e., Reduction into Primary Matter
        --- as all those know whom God has enlightened, and thought
        worthy you know this Solution and Extraction. </p>
      <p>But misunderstand me not! I speak here, not of the second
        solution of the earth, but of the first solution of the crude
        body... </p>
      <p>This is also the aforesaid short process of Paracelsus, whereby
        you, in a short time, and with little trouble and expense, may
        find the two said things (of which one is the Father, or Sun, or
        Red Water, and the other the Mother, or Moon, or White Water)
        which are necessary for the perpetration of the miracle of the
        One Thing, and for which good counsel you owe Theophrastus many
        thanks... </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us retrace our steps and
          pause at the south portal, still called the Porch of St. Anne.
          It offers us only a single motif, but the interest of this is
          considerable, because it describes the shortest practice of
          our Science and among lessons in stone it therefore deserves
          pride of place.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See," says Grillot de
          Givry, "sculptured on the right portal of Notre Dame of Paris,
          the bishop perched above an athanor, where the philosophical
          mercury, chained in limbo, is being sublimated. It teaches the
          origin of the sacred fire; and the Chapter of the cathedral,
          by leaving this door closed all the year in accordance with a
          secular tradition, shows that this is not the vulgar way, but
          one unknown to the crowd and reserved for the small number of
          the elite of wisdom."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few alchemists will admit
          the possibility of two ways, one short and easy, called the
          dry way, the other longer and less rewarding, called the moist
          way. This may be due to the fact that many authors deal
          exclusively with the longer process, either because they do
          not know of the other, or because they prefer to remain silent
          about it, rather than to teach its principles. Pernety refuses
          to believe in those alternative methods, while Huginus a
          Barma, on the contrary, asserts that the ancient masters, such
          as Geber, Lully and Paracelsus, each had his own particular
          process.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemically speaking, there
          is no objection to a method, employing the moist way, being
          replaced by another, which makes use of dry reactions, in
          order to arrive at the same result. Hermetically the emblem we
          are studying is a proof of this. We shall find a second one in
          the 18th century Encyclopedia, where the assurance is given
          that the Great Work may be accomplished in two ways; one,
          called the moist way, being longer but held more in honour and
          the other, or dry way, being much less esteemed. In the latter
          "the celestial Salt, which is the Philosophers' mercury, must
          be boiled for four days in a crucible over a naked fire,
          together with a terrestrial metallic body."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second part of the
          work, attributed to Basil Valentine, but which seems rather to
          be by Senior Zadith, the author appears to have the dry way in
          mind when he writes that "in order to arrive at this art,
          neither great labor nor trouble is required and the expenses
          are small, the instruments of little worth. For this Art may
          be learnt in less than 12 hours and brought to perfection
          within the space of 8 days, if it has its own principle within
          itself."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philalethes, in Chapter XIX
          of the <i>Introitus</i>, after having spoken of the long way,
          which he describes as tiresome and good only for rich people,
          says: "But by our way no more than a week is necessary; God
          has reserved this rare and easy way for the despised poor and
          for abject saints."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore,
          Langlet-Dufresnoy, in his <i>Remarques</i> on this chapter,
          thinks that "this way is achieved by the double philosophical
          mercury" and adds: "The work is thereby accomplished in 8
          days, instead of taking nearly 18 months by the first way."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shortened way, which
          is, however, covered by a thick veil, has been called by the
          Wise the Regime of Saturn. The boiling of the Work, instead of
          necessitating the use of a glass vase, requires only the help
          of a simple crucible. "I will stir up your body in an
          earthenware vase, in which I will inter it", writes a famous
          author, who says again further on: "Make a fire in your glass,
          that is to say in the earth which holds it enclosed. This
          seems to me to be the shorter way and the true philosophical
          sublimation, in order to arrive at the perfection of this
          difficult task." This could be the explanation of the basic
          maxim of our Science: "One single vessel, one single matter,
          one single furnace."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the preface to his book,
          Cyliani refers to the two process in these terms: "I would
          like to warn you here never to forget that only two matters of
          the same origin are needed, the one volatile, the other fixed;
          that there are two ways, the dry way and the moist way. I
          follow the latter for preference as my duty although the
          former is very familiar to me; it is done with a single
          matter."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henri de Lintaut also gives
          a favorable testimonial to the dry way when he writes: "This
          secret surpasses all the secrets in the world, for by it you
          can in a short time, without great trouble or labour, arrive
          at the great transmutation. For information about this, see
          Isaac Hollandois, who speaks of it more fully." Unfortunately
          our author is no more forthcoming than his colleagues. "When I
          consider," writes Henckel, "that the artist Elias, quoted by
          Helvetius, claims that the preparation of the Philosophic
          stone is begun and finished in the space of four days, and
          that he has actually shown this stone, still adhering to the
          fragments of the crucible, it seems to me that it would not be
          so absurd to ask whether what the alchemists call great months
          may not be as many days, which would mean a very limited space
          of time. And to ask further whether there may not be a method,
          which consists only in keeping the matters in the greatest
          degree of fluidity for a long time, which could be achieved by
          a violent fire, maintained by the action of the bellows.
          However, this method cannot be carried out in all laboratories
          and perhaps not everyone would find it practicable."</font> </p>

          Rouen, Jean Berthelin, 1651]. By using the dry path,
          represented by the earthly road followed at first by our
          traveler, one can successfully but progressively exalt the
          diffuse and latent virtue, transforming into activity that
          which was only potential. The operation is completed when, on
          the surface, appears a shining star, formed of rays emanating
          from a single center, prototype of the great roses of our
          gothic cathedrals. A sure sign that the pilgrim has
          successfully reached the end of his first trip. He has
          received the mystical blessing of St James, confirmed by the
          luminous imprint which radiated, it is said, above the tomb of
          the apostle. The humble and common shell which he bore on his
          hat turned into a shining star, a halo of light. Pure matter
          whose hermetic star consecrates the perfection: it is now our
          compost, the holy water of Compostella (Latin <i>compos</i>,
          who has received, possesses ---- and <i>stella</i>, star) and
          the alabaster of the sages (<i>albastrum</i> contraction of <i>alabastrum</i>,

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Compostella the return
          can be made either by the same path, following a different
          itinerary or by the wet or maritime path, the only way the

          The two paths of the Work require two different manners of
          undertaking the animation of the initial mercury. The first
          belongs to the brief way and requires only one technique by
          which the fixed is gradually dampened --- because any dry
          matter avidly drinks its own humidity --- until the repeated
          affusion of the volatile on the body causes the compound to
          swell and turn into a pasty or syrupy mass, as the case may
          be. The second method consists in digesting the totality of
          the sulphur in three or four times its weight in water,
          decanting the resulting solution, then drying up the residue
          and reiterating the operation with a proportional quantity of
          fresh mercury. When the dissolution is complete, the faeces,
          if any, are separated and the collected liquors are subjected
          to a slow distillation in a bath. Thus the superfluous
          humidity is released, leaving&nbsp; the mercury at the
          required consistency without any loss of its qualities, and
          ready to undergo hermetic coction.</font> </p>

          Two vases, one in the form of an embossed and engraved flagon,
          the other a common earthen pot, are represented in the same
          frame occupied by this saying of Saint Paul: ALIVD VAS IN
          HONOREM ALIVD IN CONTUMELIAM. One vessel for honorable uses,
          another for base uses. But in a great house", says the Apostle
          [II Timothy 2: 20], "There are not only vessels of gold and
          silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and
          some to dishonour."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our two vases appear well
          defined, clearly marked and in absolute agreement with the
          precepts of hermetic theory. One is the vase of nature made
          with the same red clay God used to form the body of Adam with.
          The other is the vase of the art, whose entire material is
          composed of pure, red, incombustible, fixed, and diaphanous
          gold, of an incomparable brightness. And these are our two
          vessels which truly represent only two distinct bodies
          containing the metallic spirits, the only agents we need.</font>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the reader is acquainted
          with the traditional manner of writing of the philosophers ---
          which manner we try to imitate correctly so that the Ancients
          can be explained through us and so we can be controlled by
          them, it will be easier for him to understand what the
          hermeticists meant by vessels. For these vessels represent not
          only two matters, or rather one matter in two states of
          evolution, but they also symbolize our two ways based on the
          use of these different bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these ways
          which uses the vase of the art is time-consuming, painstaking,
          thankless, accessible to wealthy people, but it is in a place
          of great honor in spite of the expenditures it entails,
          because it is the one which authors preferably describe. It is
          used as a support for their reasoning as well as for the
          theoretical development of the Work, requires an uninterrupted
          labor of twelve to eighteen months, and starts with natural
          gold prepared and dissolved in the philosophical mercury which
          is then cooked in a glass matrass. This is the honorable vase
          reserved for noble use of these precious metals which are the
          exalted gold and mercury of the sages.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second way demands, from
          beginning to end, only the help of a coarse clay abundantly
          available, of such a low cost that in our time ten francs are
          sufficient to acquire a quantity more than enough for our
          needs. It is the clay and the way of the poor, of the simple
          and the modest, of those whom nature fills with wonder even by
          her most humble manifestations. Extremely easy, it only
          requires the presence of the artist, for the mysterious labor
          perfects itself by itself and is achieved in seven to nine
          days at the most. This way, unknown to the majority of
          practicing alchemists, is elaborated from start to finish in
          one crucible made of fireproof clay. It is the way that the
          great masters called woman's work and child's play; it is to
          it that they apply the old hermetic axiom: una re, una via,
          una dispositione. A single matter, a single vessel, a single
          furnace. Such is our earthen vase, a despised, plain vase of
          common use, which everyone has before his eyes, which costs
          nothing, which can be found at everyone's house, yet which no
          one can recognize without a revelation.</font> </p>

              Dampierre VI (Panel 3)</b></font></i><font size="-0"> ---
          Lying on the altar of sacrifice, a forearm is consumed by
          fire. The sign of this fiery emblem holds in two words:
          .FELIX.INFORTUNIUM. Happy unhappiness! Although the topic
          seems a priori quite obscure and without equivalent in the
          hermetic literature and iconography, yet it yields to analysis
          and perfectly agrees with the Great Work's technique.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human forearm, which the
          Greeks simply called the arm (brachion), is the hieroglyph for
          the short, abridged way (<i>ars brevis</i>). As a matter of
          fact, our Adept, toying with words as the learned cabalist he
          is, hides under the substantive <i>brachion</i>, arm, a
          comparative of <i>brachus</i>, written in the same fashion.
          The latter means short, brief, of short duration, and forms
          several compounds, including <i>brachutes</i>, brevity. Thus
          the comparative <i>brachion</i>, meaning brief, the homonym
          of <i>brachion</i>, arm, takes on the specific meaning of
          brief technique, <i>ars brevis</i>.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Greeks used yet
          another expression to qualify the arm. When they evoked the
          hand (<i>cheir</i>), they applied by extension the idea to the
          entire upper limb and gave it the figurative value of a
          skilled artistic production of a special process, of a
          personal style of work, in short, of a tour de main, a flick
          of the wrist, whether acquired or revealed. All these
          acceptions of the word exactly characterize the fine points of
          the Great Work in its swift, simple and direct realization,
          for it requires the application of a very energetic fire to
          which the flick of the wrist boils down [pouring a crucible
          properly]. Now this fire on our bas-relief is represented not
          only by the flames, it is also represented by the limb itself
          which the hand indicates as being the right arm; and it is
          well known from the proverbial expression that "to be the
          right arm" always applies to the agent responsible for the
          executing of the will of a superior -- the fire in the present
          case.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from these reasons ---
          which are necessarily abstract because they are veiled in the
          form of a stone with a concise image --- there is another one,
          practical, which comes to uphold and confirm in the practical
          domain the esoteric affiliation of the first ones. We shall
          state it by saying that whosoever being ignorant of the flick
          of the wrist of the operation yet takes the risk to undertake
          it, must fear everything from the fire; that person is in real
          danger and can hardly escape the consequences of a thoughtless
          and reckless action. Why then, one could say to us, not to
          provide this means? We will answer this by saying that to
          reveal an experiment of this sort would be to give the secret
          of the short way and that we have not received from God nor
          from our brothers the authorization to uncover such a mystery.
          It is already much that, prompted by our solicitude and
          charity, we warned the beginner whose lucky star leads to the
          threshold of the cave, that he should be on his guard and
          redouble his prudence. A similar warning is rarely encountered
          in the books, and quite succint as to what concerns the Ars
          brevis, but which the Adept of Dampierre knew as perfectly as
          Ripley, Basil Valentine, Philalethes, Albertus Magnus, Huginus
          a Barma, Cyliani or Naxagoras.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, and because we
          deem it useful to warn the neophyte, it would be wrong to
          conclude that we are trying to dishearten him. If he wants to
          risk the adventure, let it be for him the trial by fire to
          which the future initiates of Thebes and Hermopolis had to be
          put through before receiving the sublime teachings. Isn’t the
          inflamed arm on the altar the expressive symbol of the
          sacrifice, of the renunciation the science demands? Everything
          is paid for down here, not with gold, but with work, with
          suffering, often by leaving a part of oneself; and one could
          not pay too much for the possession of the least secret, of
          the tiniest truth. Therefore should the candidate feel endowed
          with faith and armed with the necessary courage, we
          fraternally wish him to come forth safe and sound from this
          difficult experience, which most often ends with the explosion
          of the crucible and the projection of the furnace. And then he
          could cry out, like our philosopher: Happy unhappiness! For
          the accident, forcing him to ponder the mistake he has
          committed, will undoubtedly lead him to discover the means to
          avoid it and the flick of the wrist for the proper operation.</font>

          The geometric figure which we encounter here frequently
          ornamented the frontispieces of medieval alchemical
          manuscripts. It was commonly called Solomon's Labyrinth, and
          we mentioned elsewhere that it was reproduced on the stone
          floors of our great gothic cathedrals. This figure bears as a
          motto: .FATA.VIAM.INVENIENT. The fates will well find their
          way. Our bas-relief, specifically characterizing the long way,
          reveals the formal intention, expressed by the plurality of
          Dampierre's motifs to primarily teach the Work of the rich.
          For this labyrinth offers only one entrance, while other
          drawings of the same subject usually show three, which
          entrances, by the way, correspond to the three porches of the
          gothic cathedrals placed under the invocation of the Virgin
          mother. One entrance, absolutely straight, leads directly to
          the median chamber --- where Theseus slayed the Minotaur ---
          without encountering the least obstacle; it conveys the short,
          simple, easy way of the Work of the poor. The second, which
          likewise leads to the center, only opens onto it after a
          series of detours, twists and turns, and convolutions; it is
          the hieroglyph for the long way and we have said that it
          refers to the preferred esotericism of our Adept. Finally, a
          third gallery of which the opening is parallel to that of the
          preceding ones, ends abruptly as a dead end a short distance
          from the threshold, and leads nowhere. It cause the despair
          and ruin of those who have gone astray, of the presumptuous
          ones, and of those who, without serious study and solid
          principles, nevertheless set out on the way and chanced the
          adventure.</font> </p>

          Closed by its narrow lid, with a fat albeit split belly, a
          common clay pot fills with its plebeian and cracked majesty
          the surface of this panel. Its inscription states that the
          vase of which we see the image, must open by itself and
          manifest by its destruction the completion of that which it
          holds: INTVS.SOLA.FIENT.MANIFESTA. RUINA. (Only the inside
          makes the ruin manifest).</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among so many diverse
          figures, so many emblems with which it fraternizes, our
          subject seems to be all the more original because its
          symbolism relates to the dry path, also called the Work of
          Saturn, as rarely translated into iconography as it is
          described in texts. Based on the use of solid and crystallized
          materials, the brief way (ars brevis) only requires the help
          of a crucible and the application of high temperatures. This
          truth, Henckel had glimpsed, when he remarks that the "artist
          Elias, quoted by Helvetius, claims that the preparation of the
          philosopher’s stone is accomplished, from start to finish, in
          four days time; and that he has indeed shown the shown still
          adhering to the sides of the crucible; it seems to me, the
          author continues, that it would not be so absurd to question
          whether that which the alchemists called long months, would
          not really only be days --- that is to say a very short period
          of time --- and whether there did not exist a method whereby
          the entire operation would consist in holding, for a very long
          time, the matters in a great degree of fluidity which could be
          obtained by a violent fire maintained by the action of
          bellows; but this method cannot be undertaken in all
          laboratories and perhaps not everyone would find it
          practical." [J.F. Henckel, <i>Traite de l’Appropriation</i> (<i>Treatise



            on Appropriation</i>) in <i>Pyritologie ou Histoire
            naturelle de la pyrite</i> (<i>Pyritology or Natural History
            of Pyrites</i>). Paris, J-T. Herissant, 1760, p. 370, para.
          416.]</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, contrary to
          the humid way, whose glass utensils allow for easy control and
          accurate observation, the dry way cannot enlighten the
          operator at any time in the process of the Work. So, although
          the time factor reduced to a minimum constitutes a serious
          advantage in the practice of the <i>ars brevis</i>, the
          necessity of high temperatures, on the other hand, presents
          the serious inconvenience of an absolute uncertainty as to the
          progress of the operation. Everything happens in the deepest
          mystery inside the crucible which is carefully sealed, buried
          at the core of the incandescent coals. It is therefore
          important to be very experienced and to know the fire's
          behavior and power well as one could not find in it, from the
          beginning to the end the least of indications. All the
          characteristic reactions of the humid way having been
          indicated among the classical authors, it is possible for the
          studious artist to acquire indications precise enough to allow
          him to undertake his long and difficult work. Here, on the
          contrary, it is without any guide that the traveler, brave to
          the point of rashness, enters this arid and burnt desert. No
          road laid out, no clue, no landmark; nothing save the apparent
          inertia of the earth, of the rock, of the sand. The shiny
          kaleidoscope of the colored stages does not brighten up his
          uncertain walk; it is as a blind man that he continues his
          path, without any other certainty save that of his faith,
          without any other hope but his confidence in divine mercy...</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet at the end of his path,
          the investigator will notice a sign, the only one whose
          appearance indicates success and confirms the perfection of
          the sulphur by the total fixation of mercury; this sign
          consists in the spontaneous bursting of the vessel. Once the
          time has elapsed, by laterally uncovering a part of its side,
          we notice, when the experiment has succeeded, one or more
          lines of dazzling clarity, clearly visible on the less
          brilliant background of the envelope. These are the cracks
          revealing the happy birth of the young king. Just like at the
          end of incubation the hen's egg breaks under the effort of the
          chick, similarly the shell of our egg breaks as soon as the
          sulphur is produced. There is, among these results, an evident
          analogy in spite of the different causes, for in the mineral
          Work, the breaking of the crucible can logically be attributed
          to a chemical action, unfortunately impossible to conceive or
          to explain. Let us note however that the rather well known
          fact often occurs under the influence of certain combinations
          of lesser interest. Thus, for example, while leaving aside,
          after having cleansed them well, new crucibles which have only
          been used once, for the fusion of metallic glass, the
          production of hepar sulphuris, or diaphoretic antimony, they
          are found cracked after a few days without one being able to
          explain the obscure reason of this late phenomenon. The
          considerable spacing of their bulges shows that the fracture
          seems to occur by the push of an expansive force acting from
          the center towards the periphery at room temperature and long
          after the use of these vessels.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let us point out
          the remarkable match which exists between the motif of
          Dampierre and that of Bourges (Hotel Lallemant, in the ceiling
          of the chapel). Among the hermetic panels of the latter, one
          can also see an earthen pot tilted, whose opening,
          bell-mouthed and rather wide, is enclosed with a parchment’s
          membrane tied on the edges. Its belly with holes in it lets
          beautiful macles of different sizes escape from it. The
          indication of the crystalline form of the sulphur obtained by
          the dry way is thus very clear and confirms by its added
          details, the esoteric quality of our bas-relief.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The Castle of
              Dampierre (XII)</b></font></i><font size="-0"> --- But
          before we leave this masterful ensemble, we will allow
          ourselves to connect its teachings to that of a curious stone
          picture that can be seen in Jacques Couer’s palace in Bourges
          and which apparently can serve as a conclusion to, and summary
          of, our collection. This sculpted panel forms the tympanum of
          a door opening on the main courtyard, and represents three
          exotic trees --- a palm tree, a fig tree, and a date tree ---
          growing in the midst of herbaceous plants; a frame of flowers,
          leaves, and twigs surround the bas-relief (Plate XXXIII).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The palm and date trees, of
          the same family, were known to the Greeks under the name of
          phoenix, and Phoenix in Latin, which is our hermetic phoenix;
          they represent the two Magisteries and their results, the two
          white and red stones, which partake of one and the same nature
          included in the cabalistic denomination of Phoenix. As for the
          fig tree occupying the center of the composition, it indicates
          the mineral substance out of which the philosophers draw the
          elements of the miraculous rebirth of the Phoenix, and it is
          this work of rebirth as a whole which constitutes what is
          commonly referred to as the Great Work.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the apocryphal
          Gospels it was a fig or sycamore fig tree (a.k.a. the fig tree
          of the Pharoah) which had the honor of sheltering the Holy
          Family during their flight to Egypt of nourishing them with
          its fruit and of quenching their thirst, thanks to the clear
          and fresh water that the child Jesus had drawn out from
          between its roots. Fig tree in Greek is suke, from sukon, fig,
          a word frequently used for <i>kusthos</i>, with the root <i>kuo</i>,
          to carry in the womb, to contain; it is the Virgin Mother who
          bears the child, and the alchemical emblem of the passive,
          chaotic, and cold substance, the matrix and vehicle of the
          spirit incarnate. Sozomene, a 4th century author, asserts that
          the tree of Hermopolis which bowed before the infant Jesus was
          called Persea (<i>Hist. Eccl.,</i> Lib. V, ch. 21). It is the
          name of the balanus (<i>Balanites Aegyptica</i>), a shrub from
          Egypt and Arabia, a kind of oak, called by the Greeks balanis,
          acorn, a word by which they also called the myrobalan, fruit
          of the myrobalan tree. These diverse elements are perfectly
          related to the subject of the sages and the technique of the <i>ars



            brevis</i> that Jacques Couer seems to have practiced.</font>

          works, there is no greater secret than in Saturn, for we find
          the putrefaction of gold only in Saturn where it is hidden.
          Saturn contains within it the honest gold, on which all
          philosophers agree, provided all its superfluities, i.e., its
          faeces are removed from it, only then has it been purged. The

          the sun. For Saturn contains within itself the gold which the
          Mercury needs, and its mercury is as pure as that of gold. For
          these reasons, I say that Saturn is, for our Work, by far
          preferable to gold; for if you want to extract mercury from
          gold, you will need more than a year to extract this body out
          of the sun, while you can extract mercury from Saturn in 27
          days. Both metals are good, but you can assert with more
          certainty yet, that Saturn is the stone that the philosophers
          do not want to name and whose name until today has been
          hidden. For were its name known, many would have found it, who
          are eagerly looking for it, and this art would have become
          common and vulgar. This work would then become brief and
          without much expense. Thus to avoid these drawbacks, the
          philosophers have hidden its name with great care. Some have
          enveloped it in marvelous parables, saying that Saturn is the
          vase to which nothing foreign must be added, except that which
          comes from it; in such a way that there is no man, however
          poor, who cannot be occupied with this Work, since it does not
          require great expense and since little work and few days are
          needed to obtain the Moon from it, and a little bit later the
          Sun. We therefore find in Saturn everything necessary for the
          Work. In it is the perfect mercury, in it are all the colors
          of the world which can be manifested, in it is the true
          blackness, the whiteness, the redness and in it also is the
          weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore confide in you
          that it is easy after that to understand that Saturn is our
          philosophical stone, and that Bronze from which mercury and
          our stone can be extracted, in little time and without a lot
          of disbursements, using our brief art. And the stone we obtain
          from it is our Bronze, and the acute water, which is within
          it, is our stone. Here are the Stone and the Water about which
          the philosophers have written mountains of books.</font> </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask which of the three Stones is more
        useful, readily obtained, and efficacious: Well, the mineral
        method is long and full of risks. It consists in two waters, one
        of which makes the Stone volatile without labour or danger; the
        other fixes it, and is fixed with it, and this operation is
        attended with risk. This latter water is extracted from a
        certain fetid menstruum; it is stronger than any other water,
        and the danger consists in the ease with which, in ablution, its
        spirit may escape. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Animal Stone is far more difficult of
        composition, so that far greater knowledge is required for it;
        yet it enables you not only to transmute metals into gold, but
        to change anything into any other thing, whence the potency of
        this Stone is infinite. The Vegetable Stone takes still longer
        to prepare, and has still more wonderful virtues than the Animal
        Stone. It should follow the Animal Stone as far as the
        rectification of elements, and, if thus prepared, its effect
        passes into the animal. Everything transmuted by means of the
        Vegetable Stone, far transcends Nature in excellence and size,
        because it is impregnated with the quintessence which performs
        so many wonderful things in the world. All alchemical gold is
        composed from corrosives, and from the incorruptible
        quintessence which is fixed with the ferment by the skill of the
        artist. Such quintessence is a certain mortified and empoisoned
        spirit in the Mineral Stone. The Animal Stone may be the most
        miraculous medicine for the human body, just as if it were an
        extract of human blood. The quintessence which is in the
        Vegetable Stone restores youth, and preserves the human body
        from all accidental corruption. The spirit of the quintessence,
        as you know, is that which tinges and transmutes, if it be mixed
        with its proper ferment. The Vegetable Stone is more noble, and
        useful, and efficacious, than all the rest. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask me whether the work can be
        shortened; I tell you that all abbreviation diminishes
        perfection, so that the medicine which is composed by
        accurtation has less transmutatory power. There is, however, a
        multiplex accurtation of the Mineral Stone. In order to curtail
        its effect as little as possible, you should after the first
        calcination and putrefaction, which is performed with the most
        limpid and clear first water during a space of 20 days, and not
        less, separate from the substance a red powder, and distill it
        with the second water so as to prevent the escape of the spirit.
        Take only the last part of this water, after rubefaction in the
        alembic. Dissolve therein the powders, by placing both in hot
        water in a sealed vessel; then set over it an alembic, and
        distill as much as will ascend. This water pour away; that which
        remains with the body coagulate in a well-closed vessel among
        hot ashes; make other water and pour over it, then distill and
        coagulate ten times. Thus the Stone will be made perfect. If you
        wish to increase its efficiency, you may go on distilling and
        coagulating it as often as you like, or until it is impossible
        to congeal the body further. This Medicine will change metals
        into gold, and may be completed in 80 days at the most. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Animal Stone, there is no
        possibility of abridgment, except, indeed, that the earth may be
        ruled with fire, and the water with air, when its efficacy will
        be the same; this is called the accurtation of middle time. As
        to the Vegetable Stone, the same may be said. The following
        directions will be found useful in the preparation of this
        Stone… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore I speak things which are
        miraculous, which seemed to be incredible to all the ancient
        Philosophers, that is, that thou shalt know well to separate
        this oil from the wateriness and thou shalt labour in the manner
        of the mixtion of them, and thou shalt be able to make the Stone
        in 30 days, but this is not necessary by itself because the
        solutions and coagulations of it (as hath been said) are quickly
        made and done... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I demand in what time this blessed Stone may
        be made, to which it is answered as a certain author Lelius the
        Philosopher witnesses, that his magistery was finished in eight
        days, and that another did it in seven days, and another in
        three months, and some in four months, and some in half a year,
        and some in the space of a whole year, and Maria says she did it
        in three days. To this I say that the cause of diversity, that
        is of shortness and length of time, might be defect in the
        virtue of the water of Mercury or because it worketh of Sol and
        Luna. And some of the Philosophers added more and some less. But
        Sol is fixed and not flying, and with that only did they work. </p>

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermes has mentioned that

          will penetrate the body, the Spirits will keep together and
          will become like Milk, which softens, and renders fusible and
          penetrating.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the Secret, O

      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dear Aros! I could tell
          Thee another Secret, which the Philosophers before me, did not
          know or make use of! And that was not anything Medicinal. It
          is this: Take that White, Clear and much-honoured herb, which
          is found in the low Hills, pound it fresh and sift the powder
          very finely.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the true fixt body,
          which does not flee from the fire, but rather melts into
          glass.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aros: Is this the truth?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myriam: Yes, truly. But very
          few know this regimen and the quickness in the fire.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitrify or make a glass over
          the matter; over the Kibrick and Zubreck, over the two Fumes
          which contain two Lights, and when it is perfect, throw or
          project therein the fulfilling or ferment of the Tincture and
          of the Spirits, according to the true Weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then pulverize it, it is
          very brittle, and make use of it in a strong fire, and thou
          wilt see strange things performed thereby.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole Regimen depends on
          the moderation of the Fire. It will pass from one Colour to
          another, in one hour's time, before it becomes White and Red.
          When thou hast obtained perfect Redness, let the fire go out
          and let the matter grow cold, open the Vessel.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou wilt find the body
          appears now like a fine pearl, with a tint of the wild Poppy
          intermixed with white, and this is the substance, which
          inceriates, giveth ingress, mollifies and penetrates.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this Stone can be
          projected on 1200 parts of Lead or Tin.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myriam said further to King
          Aros: I will teach thee, how to proceed by the shortest way:
          with the Clear Fixt Body, found on small hills: this body
          cannot be conquered by putrefaction. Take that body finely
          powdered and sifted; rub it up gently with Gum Elsaron, rub it
          very finely and unite the two powders.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you project this or unite
          this with her spouse, it will flow like water, and when it
          cools, it will be coagulated and They will become one Body;
          project some part of this body, and thou will see wonderful
          things.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The before mentioned Two
          Fumes are the White Kibrick: but the fixt body is from the
          heart of Saturn, which preserves the Tincture.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philosophers have given
          various names to this fixt body, which is taken from small
          hills, and it is a Clear White Body.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the principles of
          this art, which can partly be bought, partly it is found on
          small hills.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our work enter Four
          Stones, and the Regimen is as I have said; the first are:
          Seoyare, Ade and Zilket.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philosophers have always
          indicated a long Regimen, and have concealed the Work, that no
          man should easily undertake it, and they pretend to be a whole
          year in doing the magistery; But all this is done with no
          other view, than to hide the work from the ignorant, until
          they can comprehend it, because it is only accomplished with
          fine Gold, which is a great and Divine Secret.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myriam said further to King
          Aros: The Vessel of Hermes does consist in the Degree of the
          Fire. The Root of our Art is a Brittle Leprous Body and
          venomous matter which destroys all mineral and metallic bodies
          and reduces them into a powder. It coagulates Mercury by its
          fumes.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myriam added, by saying: I
          swear unto thee by the living God, that if the
          before-mentioned venomous matter be dissolved and opened, it
          coagulates Mercury into Luna, by its strength, and tinges
          Jupiter into Luna and the Art is in all the Metals, but

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i> An Exposition Upon Sir G. Ripley’s
            Epistle ---</i></b> I know many pitiful Sophisters do dote
        on many Stones, Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral; and some to
        those add the fiery Angelical, Paradaical Stone, which they call
        a Wonder-working Essence; and because the mark they aim at is so
        great, the ways also by which they would attain their scope,
        they make also agreeable, that is a double way; One way they
        call <i>Via Humida</i>, the other they call <i>Via Sicca</i>,
        (to use their languages:) the latter way is the Labyrinthian
        path, which is fit only for the great ones of the earth to tread
        in; the other the Daedalean Path, an easie way of small cost for
        the poor of the world to enterprise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this I know, and can testifie, that
        there is but one way, and bit only one Regimen, no more colours
        than ours; and what we say or write otherwise, is but to deceive
        the unwary: For if every thing in the world ought to have its
        proper causes, there cannot be any one end which is produced
        from two wayes of working on distinct Principles. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we protest, and must again
        admonish the Reader, that in our former writings) we have
        concealed much, by reason of the two ways we have insinuated,
        which we will briefly touch; There is one Work of ours, which is
        the <i>Play of Children</i>, and the <i>Work of Women</i>, and
        that is Decoction by the Fire; and we protest that the lowest
        degree of this our work, is, that the matter be stirred up, and
        may hourly circulate without fear o breaking the Vessel, which
        for this reason ought to be very strong; but our lineal
        Decoction is an Internal Work, which advances every day and
        hour, and is distinct from that of outward heat, and therefore
        is both invisible and insensible… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But trust me this is not for a Tyro, nor for
        every one of us, unless he have the Secret from his own Studies,
        and not by Tradition from a Master or Guide. Know then that this
        fore-recited way is true, but involved with a thousand
        broileries. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our way which is an easie way, and in
        which no man may erre, our broad way, our Linear way, we have
        vowed never to reveal it but in Metaphors; I being moved with
        pity, will hint it to you. Take that which is not yet perfect,
        nor yet wholly imperfect, but in a way to perfection and out of
        it make what is most noble and most perfect: This you may
        conceive to be an easier Receipt, then to take that which is
        already perfect, and extract out of it what is imperfect, and
        then make it perfect, and after out of that perfection to draw a
        plusquam perfection: and yet this is true, and we have wrought
        it, And because it is an immense Labour for any to undertake, we
        describe that way; but this last discovery which I hinted in few
        words, is it which no man ever did so plainly lay open, nor may
        any man make it more plain, upon pain of an Anathema… </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray then to God, that he would be
        propitious unto your studies and labours, in giving thee the
        true knowledge of this secret Mystery; it is the gift of God, I
        have holpen thee what I can, but venture not to practice barely
        upon my words, for know that what I have only hinted, is far
        more then what I have discovered; and what I have declared to
        thy first apprehension most openly, hath yet its lurking Serpent
        under the green Grass, I mean some hidden thing which thou
        oughtest to understand, which thou being Cock-sure at first
        blush wilt neglect; but yet it will bite thee by the heel when
        thou approachest to practice, and make thee begin again, and it
        may be at last throw away all as a man desperate: for know that
        this is an Art very Cabalistical, and we do study expression
        such as we know will suit almost with any mans fancy, in one
        place or other; but be sure to take this Maxim from one who
        knows best the sence of what he hath written: Where we speak
        most plainly, there be most circumspect, for we do not go about
        to betray the Secrets of Nature; especially then in those places
        which seem to give Receipts so plain as you would desire,
        suspect either a Metaphor, or else be sure that something or
        other is supprest, which thou wilt hardly without Inspiration
        ever find of thy self, which in tryal will make all thy
        confident knowledge vanish; yet to a Son of Art, we have written
        that which never heretofore was by any revealed… </p>
      <blockquote>For ‘tis a Labour hardly to be borne, <br>
        So many tricks and turnings in it be, <br>
        And he that tryeth it is surely forlorne, <br>
        Unless a crafty Master, credit me; <br>
        For I have tried both, yet could not see <br>
        How any in this way can be secure: <br>
        I therefore who have vowed secrecy <br>
        Have writ this way, which we can scarce endure <br>
        For knowledge-sake to try, its ease will none allure.
        <p>Our Kingly road I also hinted have, <br>
          Our way in which a Fool can hardly erre, <br>
          Our secret way, which much mad toyl will save, <br>
          Which is so easie, that I may aver, <br>
          If thou shouldst see it, thou wouldst it prefer <br>
          To any earthly pleasure; yet beware <br>
          That you mistake not, for I do aver, <br>
          A mingled Doctrine these lines do declare, <br>
          I or both ways in this Book of mine do claim a share. </p>
        <p>Learn to distinguish every sentence well, <br>
          And know to what Work it doth appertain; <br>
          This is great skill, which few as I can tell <br>
          By all their reading yet could ere attain, <br>
          And yet of Theory this is the main: <br>
          Also to know accordingly to give <br>
          Due heat, which in one way thou must be fain <br>
          T’ increase ten-fold, thou mayst me well believe, <br>
          For what we decoct, t’other away will drive. </p>
        <p>Also their Operations different <br>
          Appear, the one thou must sublime and boyl, <br>
          O tedious way! In which much time is spent, <br>
          And many errours, which the Work will spoyl: <br>
          The other silently doth make no toyl, <br>
          Like the still voice which to Eliah came, <br>
          About which Work thou needest not to broyl, <br>
          Nor wantst thou fiery Vulcan’s parching flame, <br>
          A far more gentle heat begins and ends this Game. </p>
        <p>But if thou canst each Work perform apart, <br>
          And knowst them afterward to reconcile, <br>
          Then art thou Master of a Princely Art, <br>
          The very success will thy hopes beguile; <br>
          Thou hast all Natures Works ranks in a File, <br>
          And all her Treasures at command dost keep, <br>
          On thee the Fate shall never dare but smile, <br>
          No Mystery is now for thee too deep, <br>
          Th’ art Natures Darling, whether thou dost wake or sleep. </p>
        <p>Pardon my plainness, if the Art thou knowst, <br>
          ‘Twas the fruit of my untamed desire <br>
          To profit many; and without a boast, <br>
          No man above my Candour shall aspire: <br>
          My zeal was kindled with Minerva’s Fire, <br>
          And thou who to this Art wilt now apply, <br>
          My Book in Natures way shall lead thee higher, <br>
          Then ever thou alone mayst hope to fly, <br>
          If only thou shalt favour’d be by Destiny. </p>
        <p>Peruse these lines, and being read, review <br>
          And read again, and on them meditate, <br>
          Each reading shall fresh Mysteries and new <br>
          Discover, which are scatter’d in each Gate; <br>
          For they so linked are, that all relate <br>
          To each, and we our words have woven so, <br>
          That thou mayst soon erre by misleading Fate, <br>
          Unless for to distinguish thou do know; <br>
          Remember that ‘mongst Briars thick, sweet Roses grow.</p>

          --- This method has been followed by many Sages, but it is
          exceedingly slow and tedious, and is only for the rich of the
          earth. Moreover, when you have got this Sulfur do not think
          that you possess the Stone, but only its true matter, which
          you may seek in an imperfect thing, and find it within a week,
          by our easy yet rare way, reserved of God for his poor,
          contemned, and abject saints...</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the Great Labyrinth
          in which most beginners go astray, because the Sages in
          writing of these ways as two ways, purposely obscure the fact
          that they are only one way (though of course the one is more
          direct than the other)... I know both ways, and prefer the
          shorter one; but I have described the longer one as well in
          order that I may not draw down upon myself the wrath of the
          "Sages". The great difficulty which discourages all beginners
          is not of nature's making: the Sages have created it by
          speaking of the longer operation when they mean the shorter
          one, and vice versa.</font> </p>

          incombustible spirit of the moon, life and death of all
          metals, moist radical, universal dissolving nutriment, true
          menstruum of the philosophers, which without doing any damage
          or harm reduces metal to first matter. This is the true water
          for sprinkling, in which the living seeds of metals inhere,
          and from which other metals can be produced. Through this
          water their potency remains in solution in this water. In all
          kinds of aqua fortis and other such unknown philosophic
          waters, they lose and relinquish this potency. In this exalted
          water is the true vitriol of the wise, of which Rupicessa
          said: "Vitriol or salt is the proper seed to generate all
          metals, including both the remote and the proximate seed." I
          will show you its power as clearly as in a mirror: for this
          water from the fountain radically, silently, and wondrously
          dissolves all metals, white and black, by its own innate power
          and magnetic force. In an instant it liquifies metals by its
          own internal fire. It opens their pores and enters them like
          feminine seed, attracting the soul of the metal. It leaves the
          lifeless body behind like refuse that cannot endure the fire.
          Certainly it is a very marvelous thing that this water strips
          metals of their dignity. It is the dry path of the
          philosophers, by which metals are reduced to their first
          matter. It is considered very swift, but compendious. Since we
          want to proceed on the humid path, in which common water is
          added to this water to make it liquid, we must first make the
          metals very bright. This operation takes a great deal of time
          and effort, but it is beautiful to look at...</font> </p>

        according to the Philosophers, that is --- universal and
        particular. The universal way is easy and rare, and it is that
        which is brought forth from true and natural beginnings, by
        which a speedy and reformative virtue doth presently and in a
        moment hardens Mercury, and it tinctureth any metal that is duly
        prepared, into true Gold or Silver. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the second way is called particular and
        it is hard and laboursome. Note this, although Alchemy in the
        universal way be partly natural and partly artificial, yet it is
        more natural than otherwise, because by nature no strange or
        foreign thing is brought in the way of true Alchemy, for nature
        hath whereon to work because actives are joined to passives by a
        competent union and application, but the rest nature worketh by
        herself.</p>
