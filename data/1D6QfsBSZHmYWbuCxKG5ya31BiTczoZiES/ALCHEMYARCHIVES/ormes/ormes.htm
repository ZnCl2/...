          full description of this invention, including the best method
          of performing it known to us:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Field of Invention ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to
          the monoatomic forms of certain transition and noble metal
          elements, namely, gold, silver, copper, cobalt, nickel and the
          six platinum group elements. More particularly, this invention
          relates to the separation of the aforesaid transition and
          noble metal elements from naturally occurring materials in
          their orbitally rearranged monoatomic forms, and to the
          preparation of the aforesaid transition and noble metal
          elements in their orbitally rearranged monoatomic forms from
          their commercial metallic forms. The materials of this
          invention are stable, substantially pure, non-metallic-like
          forms of the aforesaid transition and noble metal elements,
          and have a hereto unknown electron orbital rearrangement in
          the "d", "s", and vacant "p" orbitals. The electron
          rearrangement bestows upon the monoatomic elements unique
          electronic, chemical, magnetic, and physical properties which
          have commercial application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention also relates
          to the recovery of the metallic form of each of the aforesaid
          transition and noble metal elements from the orbitally
          rearranged monoatomic forms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the purposes of this
          application, the following definitions shall apply: transition
          elements ("T-metals") means the metallic or cationic form of
          gold, silver, copper, cobalt and nickel, and the six platinum
          group elements, i.e., platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium,
          ruthenium, and osmium; and "ORME" means the Orbitally
          Rearranged Monoatomic Elemental forms of each of the T-metals.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background of Invention ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inorganic chemists working
          with soluble salts of noble metals until relatively recently
          have assumed that the metals were dissolved as free ions in
          aqueous solutions. In the 1960's, with the advent of greater
          analytical capabilities, it was established that many elements
          and in particular the transition metals are present in aqueous
          solutions as metal-metal bonded clusters of atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gold metal that has been
          dissolved with aqua regia, and subsequently converted to gold
          chloride by repeated evaporation with HCl to remove nitrates,
          is commonly referred to as the acid chloride solution of AuCl<sub>3</sub>
          or HAuCl<sub>4</sub>. It has been recognized that the recovery
          of gold metal from a solution formed from aqua regia is made
          more difficult in proportion to the amount of HNO<sub>3</sub>
          used in the initial dissolution procedures. It is not commonly
          understood, however, why the gold that is dissolved with less
          HNO<sub>3</sub> is easier to reduce to the metal from a
          chloride solution than gold that is dissolved using a greater
          amount of HNO<sub>3</sub>. Gold in both solutions is generally
          regarded as being present in the form of a free gold cation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is now recognized by most
          chemists who regularly handle chlorides of gold that gold
          metal ceases to disaggregate when the HNO<sub>3</sub> is
          removed and in fact can actually reaggregate under certain
          conditions and precipitate out of HCl solutions as metal. This
          recognition has led to the discovery that gold metal salts
          will exist in HCl solutions originating from metals as
          clusters of Au<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, Au<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>9</sub>,
          Au<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, up to Au<sub>33</sub>Cl<sub>99</sub>.
          These cluster salts are actually in solution with the HCl and
          water, and will require different chemical procedures relative
          to purification problems or oxidation-reduction reactions,
          depending on the degree of clustering.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Specifically, reduction of
          clusters of gold having greater than 11 atoms of metal is
          easily performed since the atoms themselves are spaced from
          each other in the salt similar to their spacing in the metal
          itself before dissolution. Reduction of the chloride salt to
          the metal, therefore, requires a simple reductive elimination
          of the chlorides that are attached to the metal cluster. It is
          now known that recovery of precious metals from aqueous
          solutions is much more difficult when the cluster size becomes
          smaller and smaller, or in actuality when the metal is better
          "dissolved."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the study of the
          behavior of gold and other transition metals in solution, it
          is now believed that all such metals have atomic aggregations
          and occur as at least diatoms under normal conditions of
          dissolution . Under either acid or strong base dissolution,
          the transition metal will not normally dissolve beyond the
          diatom due to the extremely strong interatomic d and s orbital
          bonding. A gold atom, for example, has a single atom electron
          orbital configuration of d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>1</sup>. When the
          gold salts originate from a metal having gold-gold bonding,
          the salts contain very tightly bound diatoms or larger
          clusters of gold. Under the normal aqueous acid chemistry used
          for transition metals, solutions of the metals will always
          contain two or more atoms in the cluster form.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When instrumental analysis
          such as atomic absorption, x-ray fluorescence, or emission
          spectroscopy is performed on solutions containing transition
          metals, these analyses are based on electronic transitions.
          The fact that d orbital electron overlap occurs in the
          metal-metal bonded salt allows an analysis of many of the same
          characteristic emissions as the metal itself.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">General Description of
            Invention ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During efforts to effect
          quantitative analytical separations of transition metals from
          naturally occurring materials, it was discovered that ORMEs
          exist naturally and are found in salts with alkali metals
          and/or alkaline earth metals, all of which are coupled with
          waters of hydration and normally found with silica and
          alumina. ORMEs are also often associated with sulfides and
          other mineral compositions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">ORMEs may also, it was
          discovered, be prepared from commercially available T-metals.
          For ease of description the invention will be primarily
          described by the preparation of a gold ORME ("G-ORME") from
          commercially available metallic yellow gold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The atoms of each ORME do
          not have d electron orbital overlap as do their corresponding
          T-metal clusters. ORMEs do not, therefore, exhibit the same
          characteristic emissions of their corresponding T-metal when
          subjected to analysis by instruments which depend upon
          electronic transitions. ORMEs must, therefore, be identified
          in new ways, ways which have heretofore not been used to
          identify T-metals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An aqua regia solution of
          metallic gold is prepared. This solution contains clusters of
          gold chlorides of random size and degrees of aggregation. HCl
          is added to the solution and it is repeatedly evaporated with
          a large excess of NaCl (20:1 moles Na to moles Au) to moist
          salts. The addition of NaCl allows the eventual formation of
          NaAuCl<sub>3</sub>, after all HNO<sub>3</sub> is removed from
          the solution. The sodium, like gold, has only one unpaired s
          electron and, accordingly, tends to form clusters of at least
          two atoms. The sodium, however, does not d orbitally overlap
          the gold atom as it has no d electrons, resulting in a surface
          reaction between the sodium atoms and the gold atoms. This
          results in a weakening of the gold-gold cluster stability and
          causes the eventual formation of a sodium-gold linear bond
          with a weakened d orbital activity in the individual gold
          atoms. The sodium-gold compound, formed by repeated
          evaporation to salts, will provide a chloride of sodium-gold.
          In these salts the sodium and gold are believed to be charged
          positive, i.e., have lost electrons: and the chlorine is
          negative, i.e., has gained electrons. When the salts are
          dissolved in water and the pH slowly adjusted to neutral, full
          aquation of the sodium-gold diatom will slowly occur and
          chloride is removed from the complex. Chemical reduction of
          the sodium-gold solution results in the formation of a sodium
          auride. Continued aquation results in disassociation of the
          gold atom from the sodium and the eventual formation of a
          protonated auride of gold as a grey precipitate. Subsequent
          annealing produces the G-ORME. The G-ORME has an electron
          rearrangement whereby it acquires a d orbital hole or holes
          which share energy with an electron or electrons. This pairing
          occurs under the influence of a magnetic field external to the
          field of the electrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G-ORMEs are stable and
          possess strong interatomic repulsive magnetic forces, relative
          to their attractive forces. G-ORME stability is demonstrated
          by unique thermal and chemical properties. The white saltlike
          material that is formed from G-ORMEs after treatment with
          halogens, and the white oxide appearing material formed when
          G-ORMEs are treated with fuming HClO<sub>4</sub> or fuming H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
          are dissimilar from the T-metal or its salts. The G-ORME will
          not react with cyanide, will not be dissolved by aqua regia,
          and will not wet or amalgamate with mercury. It also does not
          sinter at 800°C under reducing conditions, and remains an
          amorphous powder at 1200C. These characteristics are contrary
          to what is observed for metallic gold and/or gold cluster
          salts. G-ORMEs require a more negative potential than -2.45 v
          to be reduced, a potential that cannot be achieved with
          ordinarily known aqueous chemistry.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The strong interatomic
          repulsive forces are demonstrated in that the G-ORMEs remain
          as a powder at 1200C. This phenomenon results from canceling
          of the normal attractive forces arising from the net
          interaction between the shielded, paired electrons and the
          unshielded, unpaired s and d valence electrons. G-ORMEs have
          no unpaired valence electrons and, therefore, tend not to
          aggregate as would clusters of gold which have one or more
          unpaired valence electrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G-ORMEs can be reconverted
          to metallic gold from which they were formed. This
          reconversion is accomplished by an oxidation rearrangement
          which removes all paired valence electrons together with their
          vacancy pair electrons, with a subsequent refilling of the d
          and s orbitals with unpaired electrons until the proper
          configuration is reached for the T-metal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This oxidation rearrangement
          is effected by subjecting the G-ORME to a large negative
          potential in the presence of an electron-donating element,
          such as carbon, thus forming a metallic element-carbon
          chemical bond. For that metal-carbon bond to occur the carbon
          must provide for the horizontal removal of the d orbital
          vacancy of the ORME. The carbon acts like a chemical fulcrum.
          When the element-carbon bond is reduced by way of further
          decreasing the potential, the carbon receives a reducing
          electron and subsequently vertically inserts that reducing
          electron below the s orbitals of the element, thus forming
          metallic gold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above general
          description for the preparation of G-ORME from commercially
          available metallic gold is applicable equally for the
          preparation of the remaining ORMEs, except for the specific
          potential energy required and the use of nascent nitrogen (N)
          rather than carbon to convert the other ORMEs to their
          constituent metallic form. The specific energies range between
          -1.8 V and -2.5 V depending on the particular element.
          Alternatively this rearrangement can be achieved chemically by
          reacting NO gas with the T-metal ORMEs other than gold. Nitric
          oxide is unique in that it possesses the necessary chemical
          potential as well as the single unpaired electron.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Theory of ORMEs Formation
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">T-metals can possess an
          electron rearrangement between the <i>d</i> and <i>s</i>
          orbitals as seen from FIGURE 1 of the drawing which plots the
          principal quantum number versus the atomic number. The boxed
          areas designated A, B, and C establish that the 3<i>d</i>
          electron energies of copper and cobalt are very close to the
          same energy level as the 4<i>s</i> electron energies. The 4<i>d</i>
          electron energies of silver and rhodium are almost identical
          to the 5<i>s</i> orbital energies, and the 5<i>d</i> gold and
          iridium electron energies are approaching the 6<i>s</i> level
          energies. The proximity of the energy bands of the T-metals
          makes them unique with respect to other elements. This
          proximity allows an easier transition to their lowest energy
          state, as hereinafter described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When two transition metal
          atoms are bound together, they can <i>d</i> bond, or <i>s</i>
          bond, or they can <i>d</i> and <i>s</i> bond. When the two
          atoms <i>s</i> bond, their atomic distances are further apart
          and, therefore, their density is lower than when there is both
          <i>d</i> and <i>s</i> bonding. The amount of <i>d</i>
          orbital bonding activity is in direct proportion to the
          cluster size. Therefore, a single atom cluster will have less
          <i>d</i> bonding activity and more <i>s</i> bonding activity
          than will a cluster of 7 or more atoms. In addition; the
          chemical stability of the smaller clusters is much less than
          that of the metal because, when <i>d</i> orbital bonding is
          achieved, the <i>s</i> bonding is made more stable by
          overlapping of the two energy levels.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is known that there
          exists a critical size, in the range of 3-20 atoms, for Pd II,
          Ag I and Au III, by way of example, which is necessary for
          metal deposition from solution. As the number of atoms in the
          T-metal cluster decreases through continuous evaporation in
          the presence of NaCl, the solution becomes a solution of
          diatoms which in the case of gold is represented as Au<sup>-1</sup>
          - Au<sup>+1</sup> i.e., Au<sup>-1</sup> bonded to Au<sup>+1</sup>.
          The rationale for this representation of a gold diatom is
          based upon the fact that a single gold atom has an odd spin
          electron, as does rhodium, iridium, gold, cobalt and copper of
          the T-metals. In a diatom of gold, the two odd spin electrons
          will be found on one of the two atoms but not both. Thus, a
          diatom of gold is made by a bond between an aurous (Au<sup>+1</sup>)
          atom and an auride (Au<sup>-1</sup>) atom.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          enables the breaking of the diatom bond by introducing a more
          electro-positive element, such as sodium or any alkali or
          alkaline earth elements, which does not have a <i>d</i>
          orbital overlap capability. This element replaces the aurous
          (Au<sup>+1</sup>) forming, in this case, a sodium auride. In
          effect, the sodium weakens the <i>d</i> orbital overlapping
          energies between the atoms of the gold diatom as well as
          elevating a <i>d</i> orbital electron towards the s orbital,
          thereby creating a negative potential on the surface of the
          atom. This negative potential enables an interreaction of the
          s orbital with chemiabsorbed water through electron donation
          and reception.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sodium auride, when in
          aqueous solution at or near neutral pH, will form sodium
          hydroxide and a monomeric water-soluble auride. The monomeric
          auride (Au<sup>-1</sup>) is unstable and seeks a lower energy

          and <i>s</i> orbitals. This lower energy state with its

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Water can act to remove
          electrons. Water molecules possess a net charge and attach to
          each other in vertical clusters so that an 18 molecule water
          cluster can hold a cumulative potential of -2.50 V. The
          potential of a water molecular cluster, at near neutral pH, is
          sufficient to remove an electron from the <i>d</i> orbital
          and create a positive hole, enabling a pairing between
          opposite spin electrons from the <i>d</i> to <i>s</i>
          orbitals to take place. The existence of the electron pairing
          is confirmed by infrared analysis, illustrated in FIGURE 4,
          which identifies the vibrational and rotational motions caused
          by energy exchange between these two mirror image electrons.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attempting to quantify the
          number of electrons remaining in an ORME is extremely
          difficult due to the electrons lost to oxidation, thermal
          treatment, and the inability, except from theory, to quantify
          electron pairs using electron quanta. It is established,
          however, that the ORME does not have valence electrons
          available for standard spectroscopic analysis such as atomic
          absorption, emission spectroscopy or inductively coupled
          plasma spectroscopy. Moreover, x-ray fluorescence or x-ray
          diffraction spectrometry will not respond the same as they do
          with T-metals in standard analysis. The existence of an ORME,
          while not directly identifiable by the aforesaid standard
          analyses, can be characterized by infrared (IR) spectra by a
          doublet which represents the bonding energy of the electron
          pairs within the ORME. The doublet is located at approximately
          1427 and 1490 cm<sup>-1</sup> for a rhodium ORME. The doublet
          for the other ORMEs is between about 1400 and 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup></font>

          resulting from electron pairing within the individual atom. If
          this annealing is performed in the absence of an external
          magnetic field, then the electron pairing produces the
          characteristic doublets. The electron pair will be bound in
          the valence orbitals of the atom. If the annealing is
          performed in the presence of an external magnetic field,
          including the earth's magnetic field, quantum electron pair
          movement can be produced and maintained in the range of one
          gauss up to approximately 140 gauss in the case of Ir and,
          therefore, no IR doublet will be detected in this resulting
          quantum state.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The limiting condition of
          the ORME state is defined according to the present invention

          T-metal elements. The ORME is electronically rearranged and
          electron paired, but relative to time has not reached the

          and which T-metals do not possess under any condition. It is
          the existence of the doublet that is critical, not its exact
          location in the IR spectra. The location can shift due to
          binding energy, chemical potential, of the individual element

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A T-metal monoatom which is
          in a -1 oxidation state is in a lower energy state than the
          same T-metal would be in at zero state with metal-metal
          bonding. This lowering of the perturbation reaction between
          the electrons and the nucleus of the monoatom because of the
          increased degrees of freedom allows the nucleus to expand its
          positive field to encompass the normally unshielded d and s
          valence electrons. This overlying positive magnetic field
          reduces the Coulomb repulsion energies that normally exist
          between the valence electrons. Pairing by those electrons
          becomes possible and over time occurs. Electron pairing
          provides a more stable and lower energy state for the
          monoatom.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ORME state is achieved
          when the electron pairs have formed in the monoatom. A
          phenomenon of electron pairs is that the interacting,
          spin-paired electrons initially interreact by emitting phonon
          energy. The total energy of the pair reduces over time until
          it reaches a minimum where no phonons are emitted. This
          condition has been referred to by physicists as "adiabatic
          ground state". This state of electron pairing is a total lower
          energy state in much the same way that chemical combinations
          of elements are in a lower energy state than the constituent
          uncombined elements. For example, in the same way that it
          takes energy to dissociate water into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
          it will take energy to break the electron pair.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As this process of phonon
          emission by electrons during pairing is a function of
          temperature and time, thermal annealing can decrease the time
          required to reach ground state, i.e., all valence electrons
          paired. The cooling side of the annealing cycle is essential
          to effect a full conversion to an S-ORME state. Cooling to
          room temperature is sufficient for all element ORMEs with the
          exceptions of silver, copper, cobalt and nickel, which require
          a lower temperature. Therefore, thermal annealing reduces the
          time dependency of the electron pairs in achieving their
          lowest total energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of the electron pairs in
          their lowest energy state, unlike single electrons, can exist
          in the same quantum state. When that uniform quantum state is
          achieved, the electron pair can not only move with zero
          resistance around the monoatom, but also can move with zero
          resistance between identical ORMEs that are within
          approximately 20 A or less of each other with no applied
          voltage potential. When a macro system of high purity, single
          element ORME achieves long-range quantum electron pair
          movement, that many-body system according to the present
          invention is defined as an S-ORME system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An S-ORME system does not
          possess a crystalline structure but the individual ORMEs will,
          over time, space themselves as uniformly as possible in the
          system. The application of a minimum external magnetic field
          will cause the S-ORME system to respond by creating a
          protective external field ["Meissner Field"] that will
          encompass all those S-ORMEs within the 20 A limit. As used
          herein, "minimum external magnetic field" is defined as a
          magnetic field which is below the critical magnetic field
          which causes the collapse of the Meissner Field. This field is
          generated by electron pair movement within the system as a
          response to the minimum applied magnetic field. The (Ir)
          S-ORME and the (Au) S-ORME systems have a minimum critical
          field (''Hc1'') that is below the earth's magnetic field. The
          minimum critical field for a (Rh) S-ORME is slightly above the
          earth's magnetic field. When the quantum flux flow commences,
          due to the minimum external magnetic field being applied, the
          doublet in the IR spectrum will disappear because electron
          pairs are no longer bound in a fixed position on the
          individual ORME monoatoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once the externally applied
          field exceeds the level which overcomes the protective
          Meissner Field of the S-ORME system ( "Hc2" ) , then any
          electrons moving between individual ORME atoms will
          demonstrate an ac Josephson junction type of response. The
          participating ORMEs will act as a very precise tuning device
          for electromagnetic emissions emanating from free electrons
          between ORMEs. The frequency of these emissions will be
          proportional to the applied external magnetic field. A one
          microvolt external potential will produce electromagnetic
          frequencies of 5x108 cycles per second. Annihilation radiation
          frequencies (about 1020 cycles per second) will be the
          limiting frequency of the possible emission. The reverse
          physical process of adding specific frequencies can generate
          the inverse relationship, i.e., a specific voltage will be
          produced for each specific applied frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">ORMEs can be reconverted to
          their constituent T-metals, but, as noted, are not
          identifiable as specific T-metals while in their ORME state.
          If a specific ORME is formed from a specific T-metal by using
          the procedure of this invention, it can only be confirmed by
          conventional analytical methods that the specific ORME was
          formed by reconstituting it as the T-metal. Further, the
          applications to which the ORMEs are directed will establish
          their relationship to a specific T-metal by virtue of the
          manner in which the ORME performs in that application as
          compared to the performance of commercially available
          derivatives of the T-metal. An example is the performance of
          commercial rhodium as a hydrogen-oxidation catalyst compared
          with the performance of the rhodium ORME as used in a
          hydrogen-oxidation catalyst.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is believed that physical
          and chemical distinctions exist with respect to the different
          ORMEs, but presently such distinctions are not known. Proof of
          the nature of a specific ORME according to this invention is
          based upon the presence of a doublet in the IR spectrum, the
          reconstitution of each ORME back to its constituent T-metal,
          and its unique performance in specific applications compared
          to the constituent T-metal.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">ORMEs are transformed into
          their original T-metal by means of a chemical bonding with an
          electron-donating element, such as carbon, which is capable of
          <i>d</i> orbital electron overlap and "spin flip". When the
          G-ORME is chemically bonded to carbon in an aqueous solution
          of ethyl alcohol under a specific potential, carbon monoxide
          is formed and the ORME forms Au+Au+, a black precipitate,
          which under continued application of potential and dehydration
          reduces to Au<sup>+1</sup> Au<sup>-1</sup>, a metallic bonded
          diatom of gold. This invention establishes that a high
          potential applied to the solution forces an electron into the
          d orbital, thus eliminating the electron pair. The first
          potential, which for G-ORME is approximately -2.2 V and for
          other ORMEs is between -1.8 and -2.2 V, reestablishes the <i>d</i>
          orbital overlap. The final potential of -2.5 V overcomes the
          water potential to deposit gold onto the cathode.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">ORMEs are single T-metal
          atoms with no <i>d</i> orbital overlap. ORMEs do not conform
          to rules of physics which are generally applied to diatoms or
          larger clusters of metals (e.g., with conduction bands). The
          physics of the electron orbitals are actually more similar to
          those relating to a gas or solid solution which require
          density evaluation between atoms at greater distances.
          Conversely, atomic orbital calculations of high atomic density
          metals give results that correspond to valence charge
          rearrangement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the atomic distances of
          the elements are increased beyond a critical Coulomb distance,
          an energy gap exists between the occupied orbitals and the
          unoccupied orbitals. The atom, therefore, is an insulator and
          not a metal. Physicists when determining the electron band
          energies of small atom clusters suggest that the occupation of
          the bands should be rearranged if the total energy is to be
          minimized. The metallic electron orbital arrangement leads to
          calculations for energies, which results are inconsistent
          since the energies of the supposedly occupied states are
          higher than the supposedly unoccupied states. If this
          condition is relaxed and the bands allowed to repopulate in
          order to further lower the total energy, both bands will
          become partially filled. This repopulation, if performed in
          the presence of an unlimited source of electrons (reducing
          conditions), will provide a total energy condition of the atom
          which is considerably below or lower than the atom as it
          exists in a metallic form. This lower energy is the result of
          orbital rearrangement of electrons in the transition element.
          The resultant form of the element is an ORME.</font> </p>

          platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and osmium,

          applied beyond the normally expected disaggregation level
          (diatom) in the presence of water and an alkali metal, e.g.,
          sodium, potassium or lithium, will first form a diatom and
          then electron orbitally rearrange to the non-metallic,

          ORMEs are not detected in these ores as the corresponding

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Example 1:&nbsp;
            Preparation of G-ORME ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G-ORME was prepared from
          metallic gold as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) 50 mg gold (99.99% pure)
          were dispersed in 200 ml aqua regia to provide clusters of
          gold atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) 60 ml concentrated
          hydrochloric acid were added to the dispersion and the mixture
          was brought to boil, and continued boiling until the volume
          was reduced to approximately 10-15 ml. 60 ml concentrated HCl
          were added, and the sample brought to boil and checked for
          evolution of NOCl fumes. The process was repeated until no
          further fumes evolved, thus indicating that the nitric acid
          had been removed and the gold had been converted completely to
          the gold chloride.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) The volume of the
          dispersion was reduced by careful heating until the salt was
          just dry. "Just dry" as used herein means that all of the
          liquid had been boiled off, but the solid residue had not been
          "baked" or scorched.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) The just dry salts were
          again dispersed in aqua regia and steps (2) and (3) were
          repeated. This treatment provides gold chloride clusters of
          greater than 11 atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) 150 ml 6M hydrochloric
          acid were added to the just dry salts and boiled again to
          evaporate off the liquid to just dry salts. This step was
          repeated four times. This procedure leads to a greater degree
          of sub-division to provide smaller clusters of gold chloride.
          At the end of this procedure an orangish-red salt of gold
          chloride is obtained. The salt will analyze as substantially
          pure Au<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(6) Sodium chloride is added
          in an amount whereby the sodium is present at a ratio 20 moles
          sodium per mole of gold. The solution is then diluted with
          deionized water to a volume of 400 ml. The presence of the
          aqueous sodium chloride provides the salt Na<sub>2</sub>Au<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>.
          The presence of water is essential to break apart the diatoms
          of gold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(7) The aqueous sodium
          chloride solution is very gently boiled to a just dry salt,
          and thereafter the salts were taken up alternatively in 200 ml
          deionized water and 300 ml 6M hydrochloric acid until no
          further change in color is evidenced. The 6M hydrochloric acid
          is used in the last treatment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(8) After the last treatment
          with 6M hydrochloric acid, and subsequent boildown, the just
          dry salt is diluted with 400 ml deionized water to provide a
          monoatomic gold salt solution of NaAuCl<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O.





          The pH is approximately 1.0.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(9) The pH is adjusted very
          slowly with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, while constantly
          stirring, until the pH of the solution remains constant at 7.0
          for a period of more than twelve hours. This adjustment may
          take several days. Care must be taken not to exceed pH 7.0
          during the neutralization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(10) After the pH is
          stabilized at pH 7.0, the solution is gently boiled down to 10
          ml and 10 ml concentrated nitric acid is added to provide a
          sodium-gold nitrate. As is apparent, the nitrate is an
          oxidizer and removes the chloride. The product obtained should
          be white crystals. If a black or brown precipitate forms, this
          is an indication that there is still Na<sub>2</sub>Au<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>
          present. If present, it is then necessary to restart the
          process at step (1).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(11) If white crystals are
          obtained, the solution is boiled to obtain just dry crystals.
          It is important not to overheat, i.e., bake.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(12) 5 ml concentrated
          nitric acid are added to the crystals and again boiled to
          where the solution goes to just dry. Again it is essential not
          to overheat or bake. Steps (11) and (12) provide a complete
          conversion of the product to a sodium-gold nitrate. No
          chlorides are present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(13) 10 ml deionized water
          are added and again boiled to just dry salts. This step is
          repeated once. This step eliminates any excess nitric acid
          which may be present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(14) Thereafter, the just
          dry material is diluted to 80 ml with deionized water. The
          solution will have a pH of approximately 1. This step causes
          the nitrate to dissociate to obtain NaAu in water with a small
          amount of HNO<sub>3</sub> remaining .</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(15) The pH is adjusted very
          slowly with dilute sodium hydroxide to 7.0 + 0.2. This will
          eliminate all free acid, leaving only NaAu in water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(16) The NaAu hydrolyzes
          with the water and dissociates to form HAu. The product will
          be a white precipitate in water. The Au atoms have water at
          the surface which creates a voluminous cotton-like product.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(17) The white precipitate
          is decanted off from any dark grey solids and filtered through
          a 0.45 micron cellulose nitrate filter paper. Any dark grey
          solids of sodium auride should be redissolved and again
          processed starting at step (1).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(18) The filtered white
          precipitate on the filter paper is vacuum dried at 120° C for
          two hours. The dry solid should be light grey in color which
          is HAu.H<sub>2</sub>O and is easily removed from the filter
          paper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(19) The monoatomic gold is
          placed in a porcelain ignition boat and annealed at 300° C
          under an inert gas to remove hydrogen and to form a very
          chemically and thermally stable white gold monomer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(20) After cooling, the
          ignited white gold can be cleaned of remaining traces of
          sodium by digesting with dilute nitric acid for approximately
          one hour.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(21) The insoluble white
          gold is filtered on 0.45 micron paper and vacuum dried at 120°
          C for two hours. The white powder product obtained from the
          filtration and drying is pure G-ORME.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The G-ORME made according to
          this invention will exhibit the special properties described
          in the "General Description" of this application, including
          catalytic activity, special magnetic properties, resistance to
          sintering at high temperatures, and resistance to aqua regia
          and cyanide attack.</font> </p>

            Metallic Gold from Naturally Occurring Material Containing
            G-ORMES ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) 300 gr of dried material
          assayed by conventional techniques to show no gold present,
          ground to less than 200 mesh, is placed in a one-gallon
          vessel, fitted with electrodes, with 120 gr NaCl (Morton rock
          salt), 10 gr KBr, and 2 liters of tap water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) The anode consists of a
          pair of 3/8" x 12" carbon welding rods wrapped together with
          No. 10 copper wire. The cathode consists of 1-5/8" ID x 14"
          glass tube with a medium porosity glass frit (ASTM 10-15 M)
          with a 1" x 15" x 1/16" stainless steel strip inside in a
          solution of 36 gr/l NaCl (approximately 500 ml). Both
          electrodes are placed into the sample vessel and supported by
          clamps extending about 5" into the sample solution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) The sample is placed on
          a roller table at approximately 10 revolutions per minute. The
          electrodes are connected to a power supply consisting of a 120
          volt variac in conjunction with a 2-3 amp 400-600 PIV
          rectifier. A 100 watt light bulb and the electrodes are hooked
          in series. The rectifier load is connected to the anode since
          the rectifier filters out all negative voltage and only passes
          positive voltage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) The sample is kept under
          load for a period of 6-1/2 hours. The final pH is in the range
          of 3 - 6.5. The voltage across the electrode is 5 volts.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) After disconnecting the
          load, the sample was allowed to settle and the solution over
          the settled out material was removed by decantation using a
          peristallic pump.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(6) 800ml of the sample was
          placed in a 1000 ml beaker and 20 ml concentrated sulfuric
          acid was added to the solution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(7) With stirring, the
          solution was boiled down slowly on a hotplate until the
          solution was just dry. "Just dry" is as defined in Example 1.
          The just dry salt contains sodium gold chloride.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(8) The just dry salt was
          taken up in 400 ml deionized water and again boiled down to
          the just dry condition. There should be no discoloration at
          this point, i.e., a clear solution is formed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(9) The just dry salt was
          then taken up in 400 ml 6M HCl, and thereafter boiled down to
          the just dry condition. The dilution and boiling down step was
          repeated four times, alternating with a deionized water and a
          6M HCl wash, with the sequence controlled so that the last
          washing was with 6M HCl. The purpose of steps (8) and (9) is
          to remove all traces of hypochlorite oxidant.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(10) The just dry salts are
          taken up in 400 ml anhydrous ethanol and stirred for
          approximately ten minutes. This step is to dissolve the gold
          chloride salt, to remove the sodium chloride.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(11) After stirring, the
          slurry was filtered through #42 paper on a Buchner funnel.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(12) 5ml of concentrated
          sulfuric acid was slowly added to the filtrate, mixed, and the
          filtrate was then allowed to sit for approximately one hour.
          The filtrate was filtered through #42 filter paper on a
          Buchner funnel, and then passed through a filter of 0.5 micron
          Teflon. The sulfuric acid precipitates out any calcium.
          Filtration removes the precipitant and a light yellow filtrate
          is recovered, with all traces of calcium sulphate removed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(13) The light yellow
          solution was again boiled down to just dry, taking care to
          avoid any charring. At this point there should be no further
          evaporation of ethanol and the just dry residue should be free
          of color. The residue should have a sweet smell similar to
          burnt sugar. The occurrence of the sweet smell indicates the
          end point of the boil-down.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(14) The just dry residue is
          taken up in 600 ml deionized water to provide a water-soluble
          gold form which is the gold auride. If desired, the G-ORME can
          be recovered at this stage or converted into metallic gold.
          For gold recovery, the solution is put into a 1000 ml beaker
          and an electrolysis unit was set up as shown in FIGURE 2 of
          the drawing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIGURE 2 of the
          drawing, the electrolysis unit comprises a 220 volt, 120 amp
          power supply (20) which is connected to the anode (12) and
          cathode (14) of the electrolytic cell. The solution is stirred
          using a magnetic stirrer (16). The anode (12) is a gold
          electrode, 2 cm<sup>2</sup> in size, upon which gold in
          solution will plate out. The cathode (14) comprises a 6.8 cm<sup>2</sup>
          platinum electrode contained in a Nafion 117 chamber (18).
          Nafion 117 is a perfluorocarbon sulfonic acid membrane,
          marketed by the duPont Company, and is a proton-conducting
          membrane. Inside the Nafion chamber is 200 ml of electrolyte
          solution containing 5 ml sulfuric acid per 600 ml of
          electrolyte solution. It is important to keep the Nafion
          chamber wet at all times. The potential was measured across
          the electrodes and then an additional -2.2 volts potential was
          applied and maintained for a period of two hours.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(15) After the two hours,
          the potential was raised to 3.0 volts and maintained for
          approximately 18 hours. Bubbles formed on both the gold and
          platinum electrodes. A black material formed on the gold
          electrode after three to four hours.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(16) The gold electrode was
          removed from solution while voltage was still being applied.
          The electrode was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 115° C.
          The electrode was weighed before and after the plating to
          determine the amount of gold collected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The metallic gold is,

          transition elements of the platinum group are prepared as
          follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) A selected sample of
          pure metal or metal salts from the group platinum, palladium,
          ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, or iridium are pulverized to a
          finely divided powder.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) 5.0 gr of a single
          select elemental metal powder is intimately blended with 30 gr
          sodium peroxide and 10 gr sodium hydroxide (silica free) in an
          agate mortar and pestle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) The blended sample is
          placed in a zirconium crucible and fused over a Meeker burner
          at maximum heat for 30 minutes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) After cooling the melt,
          the crucible is placed into a 600 ml beaker containing 300 ml
          of 6M HCl.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) The melt should
          completely dissolve into the HCl. The crucible is removed from
          the solution and rinsed with water, and the HCl solution is
          carefully inspected for any insoluble metals or metal oxides
          which, if present, must be filtered out and fused again as in
          step (2) above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(6) The HCl solution is
          gently boiled down to just dry salts. "Just dry" is as defined
          in Example 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(7) The just dry salts are
          taken up in 300 ml of pH 1 HCl solution and then gently boiled
          down to salts again. The salts at this point, depending on the
          selected metal sample, are alkali chlorides together with
          alkali-cluster-noble metals-metal chlorides.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(8) The procedure of steps
          (6) and (7) is repeated four times, being careful not to bake
          the salts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(9) The salts are diluted
          with 400 ml of deionized water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(10) 30 ml of concentrated
          perchloric acid is added to the solution and then slowly
          boiled to fumes of perchloric acid.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(11) Steps (9) and (10) are
          repeated three additional times. If the solution salts out
          before fuming is achieved, it is necessary to add an
          additional 5 ml of perchloric acid to replace acid lost in
          fuming. If ruthenium or osmium is the select metal, steps
          (10), (11) and (12) must be carried out under reflux and
          washed back with water since ruthenium and osmium will
          volatilize. The salts at this point, depending on the selected

          slowly with sodium hydroxide solution until the solution
          maintains the pH of 7.0 +- 0.2 for more than 12 hours.</font>
      </p>

          precipitant is dissolved off the fritted glass filter with 400
          ml of pH 1 HCl and then boiled for approximately ten minutes.
          If the sample contains rhodium or iridium, sodium bromate
          should be added as an oxidant prior to boiling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(16) The solution is
          neutralized slowly with sodium bicarbonate to pH 7, and the

          C/min) cooled down to room temperature under hydrogen and then
          the sample is purged with argon for approximately one hour to
          remove occluded hydrogen. The material, an ORME, will be a
          greyish-black powder and will be completely amorphous to x-ray
          analysis. In other words, a certified pure noble metal powder
          has been converted to a "non-analyzable" form.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point the ORMEs,

          rearranged due to the <i>d</i> orbital hole or holes, i.e.,
          positive hole(s). The ORMEs are identified as having an
          infrared doublet between 1400 and 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The
          doublet indicates the presence of an electron pair moving
          between the d and s orbitals.</font> <br>

            Separation of Platinum Group Elements (PEGs) from Ore
            Containing ORMEs ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The class of ores which are
          processed to form ORMEs, when analyzed by conventional
          instruments normally used for determination of Platinum Group
          Metals (PGM), will indicate that essentially no metals of this
          PGM group are present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the separation of the PGE
          from the ore, the pretreatment of the ore sample is crucial.
          If the sample is not prepared properly, the pegs in their ORME
          state are virtually impossible to separate. The separated
          elements are not necessarily in an ORME state.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The purpose of the
          pretreatment is primarily for the removal of silica.
          Pretreatment comprises crushing and pulverizing the ore to a
          fine powder (-200 mesh). A sample of 50 gr of the pulverized
          ore and 100 gr ammonium bifluoride, NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2</sub>,
          are weighed and placed in a 1000 ml Teflon beaker. The ore and
          NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2</sub> are moistened with distilled
          water and approximately 200 ml HF (hydrofluoric acid) is
          added. The sample is baked to dryness on a hotplate. This
          procedure is repeated four times each with more HF. The sample
          is transferred to a platinum dish and roasted over a hot flame
          until the sample turns a dull red-brown color. After this
          treatment, most of the silica has been removed as H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>
          (white fumes that evolve during roasting).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sample is now placed in
          a zirconium crucible with 200 gr NaNO<sub>3</sub> (sodium
          nitrate) and 500 gr Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (sodium
          carbonate). The sample is then fused using a Fisher burner and
          a propane torch to a red hot melt. When cool, the fusion
          should be an aquamarine color, or a light brown color. The
          light brown color means the sample has passed through the
          aquamarine stage. This poses no problems in the subsequent
          separation and determination of the pegs. If the melt cools to
          a light green color, fusion is not complete. It must be fused
          again until it reaches the aquamarine end point.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the zirconium crucible
          containing the cooled melt, place an "X" shaped Teflon coated
          stirring bar and minimum amount of distilled water. Place the
          crucible in a beaker and cover with a watch glass. Place the
          beaker on a stir plate to slurry/dissolve the sample from the
          crucible. A minimum amount of distilled water should be used
          in the removal. The sample is now ready for distillation.</font>

          or the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been almost driven out
          of Flask #3. The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is
