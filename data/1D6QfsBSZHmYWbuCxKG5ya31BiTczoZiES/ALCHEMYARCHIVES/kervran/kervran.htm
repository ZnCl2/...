      <p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The present work consists of two distinctly separate parts. </p>
      <p>Firstly, I cite some new experiments, completed since the
        appearance of my book which was submitted for printing in 1974
        and which was published in 1975: <i>Biological Evidence of Low
          Energy Transmutations</i> (Maloine Publications, Paris, 1975).
        That book was concerned with a comprehensive view of a
        phenomenon which calls for precise analysis. This led me to
        limit research to a single aspect: to show that, however
        precisely one studies the germination and cultivation of a
        plant, comparative analysis of the seed and of the whole plant
        coming from a seed as nearly identical as possible, without the
        possibility of having an external contribution from some
        mineral, show that there is, in a very significant way, a
        "creation of matter", "appearance" of an element, thus an atomic
        "transmutation", which is confirmed by various methods of
        analysis utilizing the most sensitive, most specific, and most
        modern techniques of physics. </p>
      <p>I limited myself to studying variations in the amount of
        calcium without studying what element or elements could have
        given rise to this variation by this atomic modification. Such a
        research project could be very complex indeed because there
        could be several origins as a function of the species of
        vegetation (or animals, higher or lower, even microbial),
        confirmed experimentally: the calcium could come from potassium,
        from magnesium, or from silicon, by either separate or
        simultaneous reactions. So we have there a completely different
        point of view. I wished to limit the subject so as to produce
        irrefutable evidence that there is indeed in life forms a
        phenomenon which too many people have wished to deny for
        untenable reasons. I will demonstrate it and limit the study to
        the variation of calcium in a single cultured species, oats, in
        order to firmly show that such experiments can be reproduced,
        that the conclusions result from hundreds of experiments and
        thousands of analyses and are amply demonstrated. Accordingly,
        we are concerned here with an objective contribution [apport]
        and not with a subjective deduction. </p>
      <p>Next is shown an example of explanation placing itself in the
        framework of the most recent atomic theory, that of "neutral
        currents" already sketched in the last chapter of my work of
        1975 cited previously which included a "Terminal Note" of 1974
        from the great French physicist of international stature, Oliver
        Costa de Beauregard, theory confirmed by a specialist in
        elementary particles, Bernard d’Espagnat, director of the
        Laboratory of Particle Physics of Paris. We are concerned here
        with a very young branch of nuclear physics which is evolving
        very rapidly and I cannot even dream of following its most
        recent discoveries, out-of-date before being printed. I will
        make a very condensed review of the situation in this science
        toward the beginning of 1981, keeping in mind that the authors
        of basic principles of this theory received the Nobel Prize for
        Physics at the end of 1979. That is to say that this aspect of
        weak energy interactions is now adopted by International
        Science. This section seemed indispensable to me because too
        many physicists, and along with them scientists from various
        other disciplines, consider transmutations only a phenomenon
        which recapitulates strong interactions. Blinded by the atomic
        bomb, they have not thought that there were also low energy
        transmutations, from which they produce a stubborn and sterile
        opposition to my work. </p>
      <p>Here I give only the current status of a theory that is rapidly
        evolving. It will probably be superceded in a few years, or more
        or less revised, but it is necessary to show that it is not
        rejected by nuclear physics avant-garde, that if I have been
        correct too soon (for them), nevertheless the transmutation of
        certain elements by a biological action is in no way mystical;
        it is an explicable reality in conformance with a theory which
        is now very classical and official and still ignored by too many
        scientists. Here they will find an incentive to study more
        deeply this new entry into particle physics, unfortunately not
        possible to lay out in detail because new facts are turning up
        all the time: in 1980 did not one come, does it not seem, to
        produce evidence that neutrinos (basic particles of weak energy
        transmutations) have weight when all calculations prior to 1980
        were conducted under the hypothesis of a null mass? </p>
      <p>I will show, then, that: </p>
      <p>(1) transmutations by living matter and with weak energy, do
        indeed exist; and <br>
        (2) that they fall within the framework of classic theory of
        weak energy interactions. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Let us start out by considering a statement by Claude Bernard
        which will always be timely: "The experimental method consists
        in revising theorems and not in preserving them. Theory must
        adopt to nature but nature need not adapt to theory". Pasteur,
        on his death bed, confirmed to Renon: "Bernard was correct when
        he said: 'When one encounters a fact which conflicts with a
        dominant theory, one must accept the fact and abandon the
        theory, even though the latter is supported by influential
        people and widely accepted'. </p>
      <p>Experience has taught me just how close to truth was Claude
        Bernard. To talk about the transmutation of matter in a
        biological environment seemed to be a risky bet for certain
        theoreticians. In practice, however, it is certain that this
        phenomenon had appeared more or less clearly to a number of
        observers at every intellectual level. Many professionals in
        various disciplines have expressed this openly. It seems that
        the irrefutable facts were there known to everyone, but refused
        acknowledgment by certain persons because of their timidity. Or
        perhaps, having indeed seen the facts, they still did not dare
        say so". </p>
      <p>Thus, between the two world wars of the 20th century, a Swiss
        agronomist, Pfeiffer, who emigrated to the USA, called attention
        to the fact that a gardener perceived that his land lacked
        calcium when his lawns were covered with daisies (or with
        buttercups). It is obvious to everyone. The turf is composed
        primarily of rye-grass, a calcareous plant --- one which
        consumes calcium --- which is therefore an indispensable
        component of the soil in order for it to grow well. By contrast,
        daisies and buttercups, etc., are calcifugous plants: their
        development is not satisfactory unless the soil is acid, almost
        completely without calcium. Having had the curiosity to analyze
        the ashes of the daisies, however, Pfeiffer discovered that
        these plants, which fled from calcarious soil , were rich in
        calcium. Could it be that a balance is established, something
        like a symbiosis between rye-grass and daisy, precisely because
        the daisy produced in the soil, by developing and dying, the
        calcium needed for a good growth of rye-grass? He did not push
        his research any further, simply accepting the assumption that
        in this soil, from which the calcareous component was sucked up
        by the rye-grass carried off after having mowed the lawn, there
        was a creation of calcium by the daisies. That was scarcely
        orthodox and he did not dare state that position openly --- to
        protect his career, perhaps? </p>
      <p>A discovery of the same order may be credited to
        horticulturists who were intensively growing heather land
        flowers for resale. The calcifugous plants (azaleas, etc.) did
        very well in a "good" heather land for several years. Then,
        little by little, the culture declined and it was necessary to
        abandon plantations of this sort or to renovate the arable soil.
        In horticulture we find eminent engineers and superior
        technicians who thought that the solution to their
        disappointments could only be realized by chemical analysis of
        their land. Accordingly, they discovered that this land,
        originally acid, had become basic, or occasionally neutral,
        clearly richer in calcareous substance, even though taking into
        consideration that they were growing calcifugous plants they had
        certainly avoided laying on any calcareous fertilizer
        whatsoever. Where did this undesirable element come from? </p>
      <p>Did they visualize an elevating of calcium from the subsoil by
        capillarity? But certain cultivation, from all evidence, was not
        on a calcareous subsoil. To get to the bottom of this they
        removed the stratum of arable soil right up to the subjacent
        layer of impermeable clay, laid out some sheets of plastic on
        this layer to insure that there would be no reestablishment of
        calcareous substance by any sort of unfortunate migration,
        vertical or horizontal, and then covered the plastic over again
        with a layer of good heather land soil which had been carefully
        analyzed. </p>
      <p>After a few years there was a repetition of the preceding
        observations: without bringing in any calcareous substance the
        soil was enriched in calcium. Having become acquainted with my
        studies they asked me at a conference to explain to them the
        mechanism by which I thought: in my opinion there had been
        production of calcium by the rootlets remaining with each
        uprooting and accordingly absorbed by osmosis by the roots. What
        other explanation can there be? </p>
      <p>But it does not suffice to deduce and affirm. It must be
        demonstrated scientifically by systematic and rigorous
        experiments. I did that. One will find in the present work
        irrefutable demonstrations that certain calcifugous plants
        produce clear evidence of calcium in clearly measurable
        quantities, absolutely without any possibility of error,
        excluding the possibility of a change in solar radioactivity.
        Agronomists who know how to observe and whose judgment is not
        obliterated by obsolete dogma clearly admitted this since it was
        a phenomenon well known to their profession for some decades,
        although still formulated with too much timidity. </p>
      <p>I should also cite results of analyses given by semi-official
        Tables of Nutrients, often referred to under the name of Tables
        of L. Randoin, accounting services of the National Ministry of
        Education. They do not make precise distinctions for different
        varieties; they only give averages for genera and species and
        sometimes the analyses --- without precise methods --- have been
        borrowed by different authors. Lets take the case of the
        soybean. It gives the composition of the seed. We give here only
        the percentage of calcium, the element which will mainly be
        studied in this book. </p>
      <p>It gives: 280 mg per 100 gr of material. In soya sprouts, it
        indicates for Ca: 48 mg per 100 gr </p>
      <p>These values are given without precise description of
        cultivation and methods of analysis (all chemical at this time).
        Accordingly, they cannot be compared without some calculations.
        The seed is given with a percentage of water of 7.5 gr per 100
        gr of material, while in the shoots there were 86 gr of water
        per 100 gr of material. From this fact, proceeding from
        equivalent dryness (that of the seed being the starting point),
        the percentage of Ca, which is 48 mg (for 86 gr water) would be
        554 mg in lieu of 280 in the seed, for 7.5 gr of water. The
        increase in the sprouts then, is in the neighborhood of 96%,
        which is clearly in the order of magnitude of the increase of Ca
        in germinated oats, as we will see further on. </p>
      <p>So then, did the plants only accomplish a chemical exchange? Or
        did they accomplish alchemy? This word generated fear and was
        rejected with horror by scientists subjugated by concepts of
        physics much too recently established to be lightly set aside. </p>
      <p>Too many physicists believed devoutly in laws which they
        considered to be general, universal, and applicable under all
        circumstances. The evidence of facts which could not be
        explained by their theories, which could not even come close to
        disturbing the pattern of their professional commitments. </p>
      <p>For them it was actually profane to think that a transmutation
        could be accomplished by a living organism. This was evidence of
        feeble-mindedness... Indeed, people were obliged to admit that
        transmutation phenomena could be produce din nature and in the
        second third of the 20th century we even succeeded in
        reproducing radioactive transmutations (1935). At the same time,
        non-radioactive transmutations had been artificially produced
        since 1919. Then it was in 1945 that the atomic bomb had a
        formidable impact on the thinking of physicists, blocking all
        critical thinking in far too many of them. </p>
      <p>As a result of my previous studies, first published in 1936, I
        was officially appointed at the national level, to follow
        closely the creation of nuclear physics essentially to promote
        security measures to prevent biological effects of atomic
        radiations. For a period of 20 years, up to my retirement, I
        retained these functions, periodically reconfirmed by council
        orders. Thus, I was at the interface between physics and biology
        before the emergence of atomic energy. As a matter of fact, I
        was present at the birth of nuclear physics and was able to
        follow all its developments. Because of my official duties no
        laboratory classified secret was closed to me. </p>
      <p>In 1936 the author published the first results of his
        experimental research showing that the human body does not
        follow Ohm’s law, that its resistance varies as an inverse
        function of voltage applied, which explains values which are not
        independent of voltage output from the ohmmeters employed (for
        example, see <i>Outlines of Industrial Medicine</i> by Prof
        Simonin, Maloine Publ., Paris) </p>
      <p>These researches were interrupted by the second world war, and
        in 1940, the author was arrested for Resistance, incarcerated at
        Fort Montluc in Lyon, and found guilty without appeal. Having
        served his time, he participated in setting up the Southeast
        Resistance. In 1944 he was appointed Prefect by the general
        assembly of the Committees of Liberation of Savoy, and then
        given the duties of Regional Prefect of Savoy-Dauphine. He
        received the Medal of the Resistance. Shortly thereafter he
        re-entered his original cadre as director in charge of
        scientific functions at Paris for a period of 20 years. </p>
      <p>That is why I assessed the value of what was obtained with
        certainty in this discipline but also the limits of our
        knowledge in accordance with the trend of the times. It seemed
        to me that, primarily in biology, but also in physics,
        unverified data were being assumed by inference [extrapolation],
        even though they were contradicted by certain observations which
        oriented me along channels which were being ignored completely
        by most atomic physicists who were unable to question their own
        understanding. </p>
      <p>"You should discuss the matter with your peers", they once said
        to me. But who were my peers? As a function of my duties I was
        also named "director of conferences" at the University of Paris.
        That was, in fact, the official designation, as represented in
        the Dean’s teaching directories. Accordingly, were my pers these
        tens of thousands of teachers on our faculties? Could I put
        myself in the same structure as tens of thousands of professors
        of higher education when I had a unique function in France,
        recognized by an official appointment (and even several
        inter-ministry groups representing all the ministries
        scientifically interested in atomic energy, by one title or
        another, also appointed me to represent them in the
        inter-ministerial commissions which were obliged to take
        regulatory actions in this domain requiring expertise in both
        biology and atomic physics (Atomic Population Protection, Public
        Health, etc.) </p>
      <p>Indeed I knew, having been a member of the examining committee
        at the doctorate level (before the title was degraded by
        creating the "third level doctorate") how impossible it is to
        avoid that in a huge corps of tens of thousands of members some
        diplomas slide by that are really below any standard. If they
        are, in the overall, about one quarter of mediocre, about
        one-half average, and one quarter good from which one can select
        out a true elite, several working together --- I had no
        practical way of deciding who was a member of this elite group,
        and, in any case, it was not up to me to make such a necessarily
        subjective and arbitrary decision. I make no claim to be
        universal but I would recognize who in the national scene had an
        "international value" and that my duties enabled me to consult,
        moreover, if need be, on any detail, in order to achieve a
        synthesis, which is becoming more and more difficult to realize
        because of intensified specialization which no longer leaves a
        place for any but the "analysts", and rejects the "synthesists".
      </p>
      <p>In 1950 I began to publish the first results of my research
        showing that living matter, both animals and plants,
        accomplished transmutations of elements. These transmutations
        were observed in man, animals, microorganisms and plants. They
        were transmutations which, from all evidence, had nothing in
        common with high energy transmutations which are the only ones
        which the majority of atomic physicists are inclined to accept
        and the only interactions which scientists in general accept
        without any reservations. However, this did not block official
        acknowledgment of the value of my work and in 1964 I received
        recognition with a Legion of Honor ribbon. </p>
      <p>I has experimentally produced irrefutable evidence of the
        existence of facts which could not be explained solely in terms
        of "chemical" biology. I had evidence of phenomena of
        non-radioactive atomic physics which could not be explained by
        classical atomic physics of this time. But I had established
        that the only thing which could account for the observed results
        was a nuclear physics which remained to be more precisely
        developed and which I was the first to express in clearly stated
        formulae of nuclear reactions. </p>
      <p><b>(1) "Life Is Nothing But Chemistry" ~</b> </p>
      <p>To a greater and greater extent, throughout the 19th century
        and then more fully in the 20th century we have been taught that
        all biological phenomena depend upon chemical reactions. I
        certainly do not deny the truth of this obvious situation. But
        that is only part of the truth. If one desires to reduce
        everything to chemistry one is led into serious errors with
        respect to human, animal and vegetal biology. </p>
      <p>In advanced agricultural schools and faculties of science and
        medicine one still sees it advanced with laughable
        self-confidence that, as an example, water is always water;
        there is only one formula for water: H<sub>2</sub>O (which
        should be expressed less rigidly, for we can have H3O4, etc, and
        the diversity of snow crystals shows that... but I do not wish
        to deal with chemistry). Take some grapes which have been slowly
        dried out, then soak them in pure water which bears a trace of
        mineral or organic matter. Everyone knows that grapes thus
        reconstituted do not taste the same as and have other properties
        than fresh grapes. Likewise, chemical analysis shows that
        composition with respect to carbohydrates, lipids and proteins
        differs between fresh and dried grapes and that these
        differences are not simply a matter of water evaporation. All
        nutritionists who are not blinded by dogma recognize this and
        take it into account. </p>
      <p>Otherwise stated, simplified chemistry fails to account for
        modifications of molecular structure resulting from a physical
        phenomenon such as gradual evaporation. But that is nothing more
        than an aspect which can be easily explained, for example, by
        classic procedures of stereochemistry. In my publications and in
        conferences I have called attention to the transformation that
        the organism forces on carbohydrates to generate lipids (one can
        fatter a pig on nothing but potatoes which are rich in
        carbohydrates but poor in lipids). In a diet nothing will
        suppress lipids for people who have a tendency to fatten on
        carbohydrates. It appears that their organism provokes this
        transformation into lipids as a result of some metabolic
        disturbance which may have a number of glandular or alimentary
        causes such as a magnesium deficit, etc. One does not cure the
        effects by forgetting the cause. And this is true throughout
        biology. We should remember campaigns against food substances
        rich in cholesterol, a normal product of physiological
        catabolism, If they are not provided in the diet the organism
        will, nevertheless, fabricate them. The unbalance is to be
        discovered in the process of elimination, not in the process of
        absorption. It is not without interest to recall that if certain
        individuals get fat on white bread it is because this bread is
        poor in magnesium due to a sifting procedure which is much too
        gross, all the "rich" part of the grain having been eliminated
        to be resold separately at very high prices. But few simple
        formulae have survived in dietetics, alas. </p>
      <p>And, likewise, how many simple formulae have survived with
        physiologists? For the majority of them --- and the guilty are
        teachers, for the most part, particularly chemists --- a
        carbohydrate is a tertiary composition where the hydrogen,
        oxygen and carbon are clearly defied constituents. For example,
        for decades they have accepted without reservation that pure
        saccharose was always saccharose, that there was one possible
        formula, confirmed by all methods of chemical analysis.
        Accordingly, its biochemical properties are always the same. But
        this is not true and if the chemical formula remains clearly the
        same, nevertheless its biological properties differ in
        accordance with the origin of these saccharose substances. Thus
        we can distinguish a saccharose from a beet, which does not have
        the same isotopic composition as can sugar. Nature makes use of
        several methods to separate isotopes, to modify the isotopic
        composition, and in critical proportions, making a lie out of
        the simplistic conviction of too many physicists for whom the
        isotopic composition of an element is obviously constant. In the
        bibliography at the end of this publication one may refer to the
        works of Bricout referring to various authors. We see that it is
        now a common practice for the Service des Fraudes and customs
        office to use mass spectrometry to reveal if a saccharose comes
        from beets or sugar cane, because the import quotas differ as do
        the prices. </p>
      <p>The confusion has persisted for a long time because, still too
        often, classic instruction only takes into account the Calvin
        cycle in considering the function of chlorophyll. But this is
        the cycle utilized by the beet and most dicots and too many
        publications still ignore the cycle of Hatch and Slack, used in
        photosynthesis of sugar cane and the majority of monocots. They
        have understood better that by adding tap water to dried fruit
        or to concentrated fruit juice one cannot obtain the qualities
        of fresh fruit and fresh juice. The water in a fresh fruit is
        not the water found in rain, in an irrigation ditch, or drawn
        from the soil; it is a different compound at the subatomic,
        neutronic level. The number of&nbsp; neutrons differs as a
        function of the origin of water but the number of protons and,
        accordingly the number of electrons remains the same and it is
        therefore impossible for chemistry to differentiate them. I will
        return to this later on because it has various implications
        which many chemists, atomic physicists, agriculturalists and
        nutritionists have not taken into consideration. This situation
        will be considered more carefully with respect to the
        functioning of chlorophyll, a mechanism which is fundamental to
        this differentiation in isotopic behavior. However, I will not
        undertake a detailed study of that because the isotopic
        separation provoked by the metabolism of the plant is not a
        transmutation. In a way it is a kinematic operation between
        heavy and lighter isotopes. Heavy hydrogen, or deuterium, is
        approximately twice as heavy as ordinary hydrogen which has no
        neutron as opposed to one neutron in deuterium. The speed of the
        reactions has a substantial effect and Ponticorvo, in a thesis
        written in 1958, cited by Bricout (cf. reference section) calls
        attention to a reaction which leads to a 70% diminution of
        deuterium which, from all evidence, is very significant and
        cannot go unnoticed in a spectrometer. </p>
      <p>This property of living matter is often not taken into
        consideration by physicists who undertake analyses with an a
        priori assumption of isotopic constancy or, on the other hand,
        by biologists who use radioactive tracers and generalize
        conclusions from data which are only observed under very limited
        circumstances. A more precise study is definitely called for,
        particularly in view of the fact that a radioactive isotope
        destroys cellules and thus opens a pathway which modifies the
        behavior of a stable isotope. I don’t mean to say that we should
        abandon using radioactive tracers, but we would be well advised
        to be cautious in making judgments based on their repeated use.
        Belief in constancy of isotopic composition is an idea too
        easily adopted without a critical attitude and it sometimes
        leads to errors. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Lavoisier’s Law ~</b> </p>
      <p>The preceding comments show why it is wise to be cautious about
        general application of Lavoisier’s laws in biology. In no way do
        I reject these chemical laws, but let us leave them in their
        place. The statement that "Nothing is lost, nothing is created"
        actually is just a play on words creating a certain impression,
        Reality is more complex. Chemistry is indispensable in order to
        understand molecular transformations, which were the only sort
        of transformation which could be demonstrated in Lavoisier’s
        time; but at the atomic level they become inadequate even for
        those who take the position that in living matter there is
        nothing but chemistry, since phenomena occur there which can
        only be studied in terms of physics; electrical effects,
        pressure, heat, movements, etc. This is true even if one takes
        the position that chemistry is simply a branch of physics and is
        explained in terms of displacement of electrons. The present
        study will show that living matter employs energies which are
        not electromagnetic, that nature also operates right into the
        heart of the atomic nucleus, which has nothing to do with
        Lavoisier’s laws. Lavoisier was completely ignorant of this
        aspect of living matter, even though his contemporary, the great
        French scholar Vauquelin, suspected it. However, he was a
        century in advance of physics and had no practical way to study
        the phenomenon. </p>
      <p>Even in our time there still exist pseudo-scientists (by
        profession) who take the position: I do not doubt your analyses,
        but if you no longer find an element, that is because it has
        gone off somewhere else where you have not searched for it.
        Because, for them, nothing is lost.. certainly, I could not
        analyze out an entire human body at one fell swoop. Studies made
        on calves were subject to the same criticism: the analyses could
        not have been carried out on the entire calf. And so I worked on
        lobsters, but in this case the reproof was that I had only used
        8 animals. I carried out my studies on 48 mice and for various
        reasons the animals were totally dissolved in acid. This is a
        complex operation because one risks the formation of soaps, by
        saponification of fats; there are difficulties in dissolution of
        the keratin of the hair, etc. I have described these various
        experiment sin previous publications. The complexity of the
        procedures gave too much opportunity for criticism for there is
        nobody more deaf than he who does not wish to hear. And so I
        decided to proceed only with relatively simple operations,
        working only on plants and finally limiting myself to the study
        of variation of one single element, calcium, in a single plant
        species, oats, under hydroponic culture, without involvement of
        a complex culture medium, using only synthetic water (hydrogen
        and oxygen) or double distilled water. Water demineralized on
        ion exchangers was not always sufficiently pure. Or it might be
        necessary to distill permuted water. </p>
      <p>In this process I found myself in cooperation with Zundel and
        his studies will be cited further along. </p>
      <p>Working with tens of thousands of seeds I could now talk only
        in statistical terms, in terms of averages, where any individual
        difference between seeds more or less vigorously disappeared
        before the law of large numbers. These analyses, applying to
        hundreds of cases, lead to proof that one finds, in a
        calcifugous plant, a great deal more calcium in the plant than
        there is in the seed from which it came. By incomprehensible
        quibbling certain chemists have extracted from this only a proof
        that they were incapable of making a good analysis. For them the
        discrepancies in calcium composition derived from the fact that
        in the seed there were undetectable "hidden forms" which became
        identifiable after germination, after mineralization by
        oxidation. Now the "organic" form in the seed could not be
        discovered by titration. Whence, evidently, an augmentation of
        Ca in the plant. Now other chemists equally incompetent, equally
        dogmatic, explained the contrary, taking the position that in
        germination insoluble forms were produced, which could not be
        measured by titration, and that most "seriously" of all. What a
        pity for their students. </p>
      <p>Now variations have been discovered not only with respect to
        augmentations. For certain elements in a plant species, in extra
        pure water, with acid pH, there can be reductions. I will take
        the opportunity to deal precisely with these aspects of analytic
        methods. </p>
      <p>Certain people suggested to me that I call this book my
        Testament", considering my present age. But, in science, I take
        the position that there is no such thing as a "last will". I
        would be presumptuous of me to think for one instant that
        anybody’s scientific contribution can be regarded as advice to
        be followed in the future. Science itself is in full charge. In
        no way can we anticipate when the results of scientific progress
        will be replaced, when we will have attained the asymptote of
        the curve of intellectual growth. That’s why, when in 1979 I
        thought to write the present publication, I could have entitled
        it "Twenty Years Later", a title which would scarcely relate to
        me! It would more appropriately be my "swan song". </p>
      <p>More modestly, then, you will find in the following pages a
        tally of more than 20 years of work done by different
        researchers who became interested in my first publications
        showing that there were in the metabolism of living matter, both
        animal and vegetable, some aberrant phenomena which could not be
        explained simply in chemical terms. Only through nuclear physics
        could we come to understand such findings resulting from
        irrefutable investigations and I used to advance the statement:
        there are, in that which lives, certain transmutations, which,
        to abbreviate and to avoid confusion, I called "biological
        transmutations", avoiding use of such expressions as fusion and
        fission, which called to mind atomic bombs, since we were
        certainly concerned here with a phenomenon of nuclear physics
        totally different from high energy interactions, which are the
        only ones which the majority of classical physicists were
        studying. </p>
      <p>I explained this in my first article, which appeared in 1960,
        and even more fully in my first book, <i>Biological
          Transmutations</i>, which was issued by Maloine in Paris
        (1962). This publication at the end of the same year, was
        translated and published in Japan, at the instigation of G.
        Ohsawa, then some ten other publications followed in France and
        abroad with so many reprintings that, in 1980, somewhat more
        than 100,000 copies had been issued. The "biological
        transmutations" had, accordingly, made their mark despite
        certain oppositions which are inevitable when one upsets
        accepted ideas, taught traditionally, sacrosanct, and
        distributed via all channels: books, reviews, television, radio,
        where certain people had established their position such that
        they could no longer recognize their error, which is not
        scientific. But I received numerous positive supports from
        eminent scientists, without loss of professional position, above
        and beyond dogmatism, who determined that my studies were
        unimpeachable, and I was able to accomplish numerous
        publications, conferences, etc., in France and abroad in order
        to subject my material to discussion. For we had recognized and
        accepted data. It remained to explain the phenomenon; and any
        explanation is more or less subjective and dependent upon
        knowledge which is more or less accepted at the time. </p>
      <p>In any case, after 20 years, Science has evolved. That’s why
        the present publication seemed to me to be necessary. I do not
        intend to disavow my first publications, but rather to clarify,
        to abstract certain prospective notions which have not been
        realized, which will not arrive, perhaps, until later on. It is
        also intended to set aside certain over-extended representations
        destined to concretize a phenomenon produced in our cell
        structure at an imperceptible level. To explain is to attempt to
        force facts into the framework of theories which the majority of
        scientists accept at a particular time. But these theories have
        evolved in 20 years. Accordingly there are representations to be
        reconsidered and it is not excluded that we may definitely throw
        out some comparisons which I made about 1960 and shortly
        thereafter. I will show as an example that very recent studies
        recall certain representations which I proposed some time ago. </p>
      <p>Certainly, the facts and the experiments remain and retain
        their value for all time, except for experimental error which
        was not detectable at the time. It is the explanation of these
        facts which has evolved. </p>
      <p>That led me not to follow through on certain reprintings. For,
        in 1974, a sharp turning point in theoretical nuclear physics
        led me to rethink the entire theoretical portion of my studies
        and that will be seen in greater detail in the second section.
        For this reason I ask the readers of the present publication to
        disregard explanations of my books in review articles or sound
        recordings, etc., prior to 1974. In a sense, they no longer have
        anything but historic interest. But I do not totally discard
        certain analogies which can be useful and are not all absolutely
        false. Certain recent advances in exploration of the atom show
        that some notions that I expressed in the early 1960s seem to be
        confirmed but cannot be generalized in a simplistic manner. This
        infinitely small world escapes out senses in a way which renders
        it unwise to bend it into a set of images structured for our
        senses on a multi-molecular scale. Only my book <i>Preuves en
          Biologie de Transmutations a Faible Energie</i> (first edition
        1975) will be reprinted. That publication contains a general
        perspective of the principal experiments which enabled me to
        conclude that there are effective transmutations of elements by
        biological mechanisms and what are the extensive applications
        that they have found in medicine, in agriculture, and in
        dietetics. The present work scarcely touches on applications,
        constantly changing, and attempts primarily to make available to
        scientists the irrefutable indications showing that such
        transmutations do certainly exist and that we now have an
        explanation in theoretical physics which permits their
        accommodation in classical studies. Therefore this is a
        complement to the 1975 publication which will be kept up to date
        in future printings. </p>
      <p>I wanted the present book to adapt to meet the most up-to-date
        theories of nuclear physics and also to be an inventory of
        various researches specially undertaken and irrefutable in terms
        of scientific method. I wish to set forth certain material
        involving details which must be carefully considered because
        experience has shown me that well-known specialists were not
        capable of obtaining transmutations placed within the framework
        of theories which were unfamiliar to them. Due to some sort of
        professional defiance or to ignorance resulting from
        over-specialization, but in any case, unfortunately, most
        difficult to get rid of, they cannot see the decisive role of
        this or that biological situation. Routinely they are led into
        errors because they wish to transpose the concepts they hold to
        a new science which demands that they set up certain practices
        and theories which are completely out of line with those that
        they have always employed. </p>
      <p>Not everyone can set aside the concepts into which they have
        been formed (or deformed) ever since their earliest schooling. I
        will sow a few examples, but it is obviously impossible to
        address every aspect of this new problem which leads to calling
        in question an array of notions which are regarded as classic.
        One must reflect shift one’s wisdom, avoid automatic reaction.
        For all of us, when we do not understand we must wait for the
        moment when we will understand. </p>
      <p>The problem studied here remains in conformity with known laws
        of physics. The reason that we have studied transmutations for
        the most part among biological channels for the past 20 years is
        because this milieu gives a relatively easy means of producing
        them and then reproducing them. And this is accomplished under
        very precise conditions which preclude generalizing in a naïve
        and infantile manner. The energy action which precipitates the
        transmutation demands a combination of certain specific
        conditions; it does not appear in a seed kept dry but does show
        up after a few days in a seed placed in a condition permitting
        germination. There is then produced a synthesis of enzymes which
        modify the spatial structure, the stereochemistry of certain
        proteins constituting ADN, ATP, etc. But this structural
        modification is just a preliminary stage. It leads to
        exponential multiplication of the capture cross-section
        (effective capture cross section) of molecules with cosmic
        neutrinos in this ocean of particles in which we bathe. </p>
      <p>We are not dealing here with some mysterious property which
        calls in some sort of vital principle more or less well
        formulated from another point of view. I have, in fact, been
        able to show that certain minerals, in combinations in
        metamorphic rocks, so-called because experimentation and
        observation have shown that they can change their form: these
        minerals can show transmutations in line with the same theories
        --- however, on a different scale, because stereochemical
        modifications which occurred with the application of temperature
        and pressure which "fluidifies" the mineral makes atom
        displacement easier and these rocks, having come under the
        influence of cosmic neutrinos, modify their atomic composition
        both qualitatively and quantitatively. In my 1975 book I dealt
        with research done under a pressure of 50 kilobars and a
        temperature at the 850° C level. And so we also have
        applications in the study of mineralogy and I will come back to
        that briefly, from another point of view, because eminent
        geologists have been able to advance explanations of phenomena
        which were completely incomprehensible in terms of classical
        theories. </p>

      <p><b>(1) Condensed History ~</b> </p>
      <p>I refer the reader, for more details, to my basic book of 1975:
        Proof in Biology of Weak Energy Transmutations (Maloine, Paris).
        None of my prior publications will be printed again in full. </p>
      <p>In the title of this book I did not retain the expression
        "biological transmutations" and replaced it, as in other
        publications, after 1963, by the more general expression "weak
        energy transmutations" because I was fully convinced, since my
        first publications, that this phenomenon demonstrated by
        numerous experiments was more general than simply biological and
        I referred to it in my second publication of 1963 by the term
        "Natural Transmutations". In the present volume, in order that
        one not lose sight of this general aspect, I have summarized in
        one chapter a few applications in geology, but it is a very
        limited presentation of several studies appearing since 1975.
        However, it is not my intention to take applications into
        account here, and it would be good to have a book expressly
        aimed at studying the impact of weak energy physics specifically
        on mineralogy to get a view of everything available in this
        domain. I will refer to several publications, one of which has
        more than 90 tightly written large pages, and there are some
        publications which have appeared abroad. It would certainly be
        desirable to distribute a synthesis of the essential
        experimental studies along these lines because one must have
        very costly materials for this sort of investigation while in
        biology any laboratory can do research without great cost. </p>
      <p>However, here I wish to convince people that transmutations of
        elements can take place with low energy in living matter under
        conditions which will be made precise for one must never say
        that a phenomenon is general, that it occurs everywhere all the
        time. What I wish to show is that my researches are a
        consequence of putting to work weak energy interactions, and not
        a consequence of high energy interactions which have been the
        only sort of interactions that most physicists have considered
        since 1974. I save the study of physics for the second part.
        This is fundamental because too many scientists have their minds
        twisted by physicists subjugated by the atomic bomb which led
        too many of them for some 30 years (a whole generation
        unfortunately prolonged in distortion by those who continued
        teaching) to deny the existence of and fail to see the
        possibility of weak energy transmutations. However, the majority
        of truly great physicists did not lose sight of natural weak
        energy transmutations, and I will come back to that, but these
        weak energy transmutations are a phenomenon which is no less
        striking than atomic explosions and the contribution of these
        truly great physicists was more modest than that of the
        majority. </p>
      <p>When I discovered these biological transmutations and decided
        to publish my conclusions, I was not thinking of integrating
        these findings with what was known (actually very little)
        concerning weak energy interactions. More to the point, I did
        not know that very early experiments, conducted over a century
        and a half, had demonstrated the creation of certain elements
        and the disappearance of other elements (or, more precisely, the
        augmentation of some and diminution of others). Biological
        observations in animals and plants were numerous and varied, but
        for very "humane" reasons they had been kept under the blanket
        and were relegated to trivial publications which people were
        reluctant to quote and therefore they remained practically
        unnoticed. </p>
      <p>But millions of people, via my publications, widely
        disseminated reviews, by radio and by television (and because my
        official functions made silence impossible) learned about my
        studies and among them were those who were aware of previous
        experiments and several called these previous experiments to my
        attention. I should recall, for example, that the major popular
        science review <i>Science et Vie</i> (<i>Science and Life</i>)
        devoted several articles to this from 1960 to 1963 in some
        350,000 copies. Europe No. 1 (June 1961) distributed my
        40-minute interview with Jacques Mousseau and, previously, the
        Belgian television 819 devoted about a quarter of an hour to
        these matters in December 1960. </p>
      <p>If the above mentioned publications remained in the dark for
        the most part it was because they were premature in the sense
        that they were incomprehensible and too many people deny that
        which is not understood even though the facts are indisputable.
        However, I advanced an explanation by a mechanism which had
        nothing in it which was mysterious for the 20th century because
        it was in some ways parallel to fusions and fissions of the new
        atomic physics born with the century. </p>
      <p>Lacking an accepted scientific explanation these publications
        were often rejected out of hand on the ground that they resulted
        from experimental error. Furthermore, it was impossible because
        it would be a return to alchemy. That had been definitively
        thrown out by science of the 19th century. One could no longer
        go backwards. It was absolutely necessary, however, to proceed
        to the evidence of the turn of the 20th century. </p>
      <p>The discovery of radioactivity demonstrated in a striking
        manner that transmutation of elements was impossible to deny.
        One could study it better when, in 1919, the first forced
        transmutation was achieved while in 1935, there was a successful
        artificial production of new radioactive substances. </p>
      <p>In 1963, the atomic physics professor of the Conservatoire
        National des Arts et Metiers made available to me photocopies of
        several dozens of pages in which Freundler, a Sorbonne
        professor, condensed, in a 1928 book, studies conducted for more
        than 10 years on the production of iodine by algae. He is the
        first, to my knowledge, who saw that there was a connection
        between the tin of the granite support and the iodine in these
        plants. He had sensed the type of reaction that I indicated but
        he had not been able to convince anyone of this. He had come too
        soon and his calculations had a weak point. The balance of
        charges and masses was defective because the neutron was unknown
        at that time, not having been discovered until 1932. But nobody
        else, even after 1932, dreamed of reconsidering the problem
        which was nevertheless cross-checked, as it were, by converging
        studies. I touched on the work of Freundler to a certain extent
        in my book of 1963 on natural transmutations, which, after two
        editions, was not printed again. </p>
      <p>Readers of books failed to see a good many lines which were
        rediscovered and took on new dimensions when those readers saw
        my first publications. It was in just this way that a friend of
        mine called my attention to a passage of Flaubert in Bouvard et
        Pecuchet, a publication which challenged the science of the 1880
        era in a series of critical dialogs. One chapter was written by
        Flaubert under the inspiration of Regnault, a physicist well
        known to schoolboys because of his Thermodynamic Tables,
        specific heat, etc., and by Giraudin, an agronomist of
        world-wide reputation. Flaubert emphasized that the great French
        chemist Vauquelin (a contemporary of Lavoisier but more
        open-minded than the latter) had demonstrated that a chicken fed
        exclusively on oats laid in its eggs and in its droppings more
        than four times as much "lime" as it had ingested with the oats
        which had been analyzed beforehand. He provided a balance sheet
        for the "lime", which was what we would today call calcium
        carbonate, and also that for "lime phosphate" because the
        balance sheet for phosphorus was also modified. But the
        spectacular finding was the augmentation of calcium. There was,
        according to Vauquelin, a creation of matter. His memoire had
        been published 19 January 1799. He tried to see what could have
        been reduced in order to give all this "lime". But in those
        times people did not know about the atom and he did not conceive
        of certain possible origins. I was able to obtain the original
        of this remarkable piece of work and discovered that they knew
        very well how to make precise analyses of calcium at that time.
        But Vauquelin knew how to isolate and discover certain "simple
        substances" and he was a very talented and clever experimenter.
        Furthermore, in those days it was the main boss himself who made
        the analyses and not a laboratory assistant. In my 1975 book I
        devoted 10 pages to presenting this remarkable study which, in
        my opinion, constituted the oldest and one of the most serious
        experiments before the atomic era on biological transmutations,
        an expression which had not yet been formulated in the 19ht
        century and was much less available in the 18th century. I did
        not mention this test in my first publication because I did not
        discover it until about 10 years later. </p>
      <p>That indicates that Lavoisier had produced an absolute law
        which was true within the framework of chemistry but in
        chemistry only. Vauquelin showed that there was something else
        in living matter and that the problem is more complex than in
        the chemistry of non-living material. This shows the great
        historical importance of this 1799 publication. </p>
      <p>I also refer to my 1975 book for the very important studies
        published from 1875 to 1883 in Germany by Von Herzeele. He did
        numerous experiments on a great many species of seed germinated
        in a dust-free situation with distilled water containing a
        mixture of two salts. One of the salts always contained a
        constant anion and a cation which varied with each experiment.
        In other experiments this was reversed: constant cation,
        variable anion. We see that this investigator anticipated the
        phenomenon of transmutation and was studying the correlation
        between the augmentation of one element and the diminution of
        another. But at that time atomic structures were not known. He
        was then about 20 years before his time. However, the results
        that he obtained are very important since, after Vaquelin, we
        have a second stage, conducted scientifically, a valuable
        example of researches on variations of certain elements as a
        function of metabolism in the germination and growth of various
        plants. Certainly, Von Herzeele (and several others before him,
        not knowing the structure of atoms, completed certain
        experiments which had no significance, but some of his
        experiments are valid. In addition, being a chemist, that
        certain reactions are only possible as a function of the pH of
        the culture medium and could not be conducted except in line
        with the needs of plants which could be either calcifugous or
        calcium dependent. In the same way nitrogen needs are not the
        same for legumes as they are for grasses, etc. The chemist did
        not see certain aspects of plant biology. This was also the case
        80 years later for P. Baranger, who was head of the laboratory
        of organic chemistry at the Ecole Polytechnique de Paris and did
        not see certain aspects of physical chemistry such as the
        importance of photosynthesis and its relation to the incident
        light spectrum and the materials through which the light passed.
        He was a doctor of sciences and had done a thesis in chemistry.

      <p>I will limit this chapter to just those experiments done on
        oats, referring to my book of 1975 for various experiments on
        humans, animals (such as mice, lobsters, etc), or with
        microorganisms, I will briefly comment, in passing, on various
        results published here and there concerning carbon, silicon,
        phosphorus, manganese, copper, etc., as they relate to plants. I
        will not attempt to present in detail various complementary
        experiments on oats or other plants to study variations of
        elements such as sodium, magnesium, silicon, copper, etc. </p>
      <p>However, I would like to call attention to the fact that
        studies on the variation of copper in cultures of oats (a plant
        which is, in the overall, rich in copper) have showed that, with
        respect to the seed, the plant shows a reduction in the
        neighborhood of 19% (mean figure from the analysis of five
        batches). But I judge that we did not have a sufficient number
        of batches studied to generate a meaningful hypothesis
        concerning what it is that increases when Cu diminishes
        (possibly zinc?). My researches on the Mn-Fe link are also not
        extensive enough although the results tend to converge; however,
        we must look more closely at reactions in this domain. </p>
      <p>I will present in some detail an array of experiments bearing
        at one and the same time on potassium and calcium in oats in
        order to show the principal precautions one must take when one
        comes with naïve eyes into a research area that others have seen
        from a very different angle. Then I will give in another chapter
        a few results of research accomplished by J.E. Zundel, research
        carried out subsequently to those cited in my book of 1975,
        which he expanded considerably later on and which he carried out
        limiting himself almost exclusively to variation of calcium in
        hydroponic culture of oats, in order to show the scope of
        detailed parameters one must lose sight of in this sort of
        research. As he always kept me current with his results, I will
        set forth the core of his research, more especially the memoir
        that he circulated in the 1979 second semester as a photocopy
        --- then in an Italian university review in 1980 --- under his
        signature and consisting of an excellent condensation of 13
        years of practically uninterrupted research. Thanks to this huge
        amount of work focused on a precise area I believe that the
        study of oat culture has been pushed to a point that we may be
        certain there is an augmentation of Ca in the order of 100%
        (varying from 50% to 150% as a function of oat variety, season,
        etc.), the increase occurring in a plant which has germinated
        several weeks being compared to a grain similar to the one from
        which it came without there being any chance that this calcium
        came from the air, the water, the materials used in the culture
        equipment, or as an artifact of analysis. Unfortunately, due to
        human vanity, I understand that it is very difficult to obtain
        exact replication of an experiment. There are many who consider
        themselves superior to the rest of the world (or more clever),
        and they criticize what has been accomplished, desire to
        generate an experiment modifying the results in line with their
        own procedures or materials in order to get their own name in
        the ring. That’s human. But also quite frequently that comes
        from a misunderstanding of the main problem resulting from
        distorted professional judgment. </p>
      <p>But these inevitable human eccentricities did not curtail
        widespread dissemination of what some call a "mutation" and what
        I call a transmutation, a label adopted universally for this
        physical phenomenon of the mutation of nucleons in atomic
        nuclei. Thus it is that Prof. Genevois, in the introduction to
        his Biochemical Mutations of Plants, was able to write a few
        years ago, "It now seems, from collecting the facts on all
        cultivated plants of any importance, that the condition of
        mutation is a general fact. Mutations are in the process of
        changing domesticated vegetation. Perfecting analytic
        techniques... that consistency of the composition of plant
        species was an illusion". One could not say it more clearly, but
        it is so pleasant to cradle oneself with illusions, right up to
        one’s death! </p>
      <p>Now let’s demonstrate scientifically that consistency of
        structure is truly an illusion to be dispensed with! </p>
      <p><b>(a) Research on Variations of Calcium and Potassium in
          Culture of Oats ~</b> </p>
      <p>I elected to continue investigating oats because that is the
        most calcifugous cereal I have every encountered in my studies.
        It grows well in acid soils (granites, for example).
        Accordingly, one can grow it in a laboratory with extra-pure
        water which is almost always acid (therefore a proton donor
        according to the modern definition of the acid state --- and we
        must not forget that which represent the pH of a pH meter).
        Accordingly one must avoid neutralizing or "stoppering" it. I
        used extra-pure water resulting from combustion of hydrogen and
        oxygen, these two gases being the product of electrolysis. They
        were, then rigorously pure, which is not always the case when,
        for example, hydrogen comes from a reaction of sulfuric acid on
        zinc. The zinc is often too impure except when it has been
        produced by electrolysis. Commercial sulfuric acid is often
        produced by calcinations of a very complex mixture of pyrites
        which requires that it be rejected for experimental use unless
        it is a pure acid coming from refined sulfur. It was not always
        possible for me to have a sufficient amount of such water; then
        I used bidistilled water because in water which has been
        distilled only once a "head" [azeotrope] is formed at the outset
        of distillation, a condition in which there are very diverse
        volatile products which condense before anything else ---
        organic products which are often toxic. My colleague in the
        Paris Council of Hygiene, P. Levine, of the Pasteur Institute,
        advised us that he was not able to conduct certain experiments
        in microbiology or in human biology using the water of Paris
        with just one distillation. He found it necessary to throw out
        the "alembic heads" and redistill the remaining condensed
        portion. </p>
      <p>Softened water, purified on ion exchange resins, also called
        permuted water, still contain too many minerals for our research
        work. Permuted as well as possible, they must still be distilled
        by a single passage. Analyses of every batch of water were made
        by atomic absorption spectrophotometry on samples which varied
        from one to three liters per carboy and were reduced to 50 ml by
        evaporation to ensure they did not contain a measurable amount
        of Ca++ and K+ (since the experiments were concerned with these
        cations) which could have influenced the results obtained by
        more than one percent. Such experiments were also carried out on
        all those materials which might come in contact with the
        cultured plants (purex, plexiglass, altuglass, polyethylene,
        etc.). It was also necessary to consider analyses at different
        stages of the operation to be on the lookout to avoid having
        parasites get into the circuit. </p>
      <p>It seemed to me advisable to cite a few examples of such
        experiments, according to publications that I distributed in
        photocopies, for the most part, extracting, however, all the
        material which was simply repetitious. </p>
      <p><b>(b) Research on K and Ca in Oats ~</b> </p>
      <p>I abandoned research on calcitropic plants, like ray-grass, due
        to a lack of time and personnel, and in the end I limited myself
        to studies of oats, a calcifugous type of plant. In these
        efforts I made use of the publications of Zundel and some
        others. Thus, I could take into consideration a very large
        number of results showing a statistical convergence which could
        not be denied by any conscientious person. And very shortly
        thereafter we find balance sheets on Mg and Si which, under
        certain circumstances (in animals for instance), both may be
        able to transform into calcium. Already in 1799 Vauquelin had
        demonstrated that if silicate diminishes and lime increases when
        one tallies up the content with respect to a chicken as a
        function of ingested oats, the diminution of Si does not
        correspond quantitatively to the augmentation of Ca. Some
        studies --- perhaps too few --- have shown that in the
        germination of oats Mg and Si did not play a significant role in
        the production of Ca. By contrast there were a good many
        experiments confirming that there was a diminution of K
        commensurate with the increase of Ca. </p>
      <p>Zundel, likewise, only carried out a few studies on Mg and SI
        in his oat cultures because his first investigations showed him
        that the variation of these two elements was too slight and
        insignificant with respect to the increase of Ca. And he also
        set aside investigation of K for two reasons: </p>
      <p>He did not himself analyze K and did not wish to simply play
        the role of confirmatory of that which had been done by others;
      </p>
      <p>It seemed to him that the various analyses which he has had
        done by flame spectrometry, by neutron activation, and by
        x-rays, for example, varied too much as a function of the
        methods, the operators, the laboratories, and even the operators
        in one laboratory using the same method. Repetition was not
        assured with respect to the numerical values of K that were
        given to him and he had no way, himself, to determine the
        results which he could trust because he placed his confidence in
        gravimetric chemical analysis, weighing milligrams of cations.
        In this way he could measure to one-tenth of a milligram the
        creation of Ca, but with respect to what? He does not pass
        judgment on that. </p>
      <p>I will not give here results obtained by chemical methods,
        gravimetric or colorimetric. Rapid analyses for crude
        verification have been made by various methods of complexometry
        (by EDTA for example). They are often more delicate to
        accomplish than one might think because the complexant must be
        chosen as a function of the affinity between Mg and Ca. I
        indicated in my book of 1975, with respect to research on the
        lobster, why it was necessary to reject certain methods because
        the affinity of Mg/Ca varied a great deal as a function of the
        metabolism of the animal. After moult of the lobster, the method
        did not work in the majority of experiments which made it very
        difficult to obtain results which could be properly compared. </p>
      <p><b>[ PARAGRAPH MISSING ]</b> </p>
      <p>I know --- and I have cited some results --- that convergent
        values for Ca have sometimes have obtained by flame
        spectrometry. But I cannot have confidence in them a priori;
        they must be cross-checked, because some equipment uses a flame
        of a temperature insufficient to ionize enough Ca atoms and
        obtain valid and reproducible results. It is also preferable to
        have the same operator in order to better control the regulation
        of the flame (the delivery and pressure of the gas must be
        verified regularly). </p>
      <p><b>(2) Simultaneous Investigation of Mg, K and Ca ~</b> </p>
      <p>To avoid a long drawn out description in the following
        paragraphs, I will present only mean data for each whole
        experiment and will not give mean data for each experimental
        segment. Obviously, in this experiment it serves no purpose to
        take account of variation in Mg since that result has been
        obtained from ten other experiments conducted to obtain balance
        sheets of Mg when placed in a culture of oats of different
        varieties. That’s one reason which led me to terminate research
        on variations of Mg in 1976. </p>
      <p>Comments on Analyses of K, Ca and Mg in Seeds and Plants of
        Oats in the Paper-Mill Analytic Laboratory of the Grenoble
        University Complex ~ </p>
      <p><b>(a) Experimental Protocol ~</b> </p>
      <p>Oat seeds of the Flamingskrone variety (a blonde hybrid) with a
        27,5 mg mean weight per seed were germinated in special vats
        covered with an indented plate with two seeds per indentation.
        The vats received double distilled water with a pH = 5.6. </p>
      <p>A preliminary control was accomplished by destroying the water
        and material of a vat to accomplish spectrophotometry of atomic
        absorption to verify that there was no measurable amount of
        calcium therein. The culture was accomplished without added
        fertilization. </p>
      <p>Germination took place in an enclosed space of about 70 x 40 x
        30 cm of transparent plastic material out of contact with seeds
        and water. The enclosure was swept with air sent by an electric
        pump at a rate of about one liter/minute. This air passed
        through an air filter provided with one meter of hydrophilic
        cotton folded and compressed. Then it was muddled through four
        one-liter glass bottles, each filled with 750 ml of double
        distilled water, arranged in a series. The first was supplied
        with 30 ml of HCl to precipitate any trace of calcium dust which
        might have passed the filter. Then the air passed successively
        through two bottles with additives of NaHCO3 in order to
        neutralize any trace of acid drawn by the air from the preceding
        bottle. The fourth bottle contained only pure water. </p>
      <p>Thus, neither by air, nor by water, nor by material in contact
        with the germinating seeds was there any possibility of an
        introduction of Ca into the enclosure where there was an
        overpressure of approximately 3 mm water which made it
        impossible for any entry of ambient air contaminated by Ca. </p>
      <p>At the end of several weeks the plants developed from these
        seeds were gathered, dried, incinerated at 950 C, dissolved in
        hydrochloric acid and aliquot parts were analyzed by a number of
        methods in order to cross check results. </p>
      <p>At the same time there were analyzed some control segments of
        non-germinated seeds as nearly identical as possible to those
        which were germinated. All seeds utilized were calibrated and
        came from selected seedings furnished by the INRA and their
        germination rate was better than 95%. Nevertheless, each seed
        was hand-picked, the same for the control segments as for those
        which were germinated, in order to eliminate any abnormality of
        dimension (either too large or too small) or presenting a
        visible defect of form or of color, to have experimental
        segments as homogenous and as similar as possible. </p>
      <p>The essential purpose of the experiment, within the framework
        of verifying my studies, was to compare the quantity of Ca
        between seeds and plants in order to establish a balance sheet
        showing that germination of the oat --- a calcifugous plant ---
        in water with an acid pH will actually alter the quantity of Ca
        a few weeks of growth in a calcium free environment. </p>
      <p><b>[MISSING TEXT]</b> </p>
      <p>...It was requested of the Paper-Mill Laboratory located in the
        University of Grenoble complex (we note that the University of
        Grenoble supports the Superior School of Paper Manufacturing
        which trains the production engineers in this profession) to
        measure not only Ca and Mg by spectrophotometric atomic
        absorption but also to measure K by flame spectrophotometry.
        This was to cross check the results of previous experiments made
        by Kervran and by Zundel, independently, showing that the
        increase of Ca discovered in such experiments on oats would only
        have come from a reduction of K which was quantitatively almost
        the same. </p>
      <p>The measure of Mg was requested of Grenoble because previous
        chemical analyses of Zundel and physical analyses made by myself
        had always shown that in the growth of oats, a calcifugous
        plant, the Mg was practically invariant. One more confirmation
        of this came to light. I cite results from this Paper-Mill
        factory done for Zundel who sent them tome for my information.
        The analyses were accomplished in 1970-1971 but I did not
        publish my comments except by individual letters in September
        1976, with a photocopy of the schedules of the analyses. The
        following is a combined study. </p>
      <p><b>(b) Tables of Results of Analyses ~</b> </p>
      <p>We will only consider experimental segments with identical
        numbers of seeds and plants, in the two studies, one on Ca and
        Mg, done first, the other on K, done later, but on aliquot
        sections coming from the same experiment. </p>
      <p><b><a href="tab1ab.gif" ">TABLE 1ab</a></b> <br>
        <b><a href="tab1c.gif" ">TABLE 1c</a></b> </p>
      <p>N.B. --- Question marks after a value indicate that it is
        possible (in my opinion) that there was a slight measurement
        error with respect to this sample. </p>
      <p><b>(c) Recapitulation ~</b> </p>
      <p>The possibility of slight errors from one sample to another is
        offset by the law of large numbers, the analyses being carried
        out on hundreds of seeds and plants. The following table
        recapitulates the above material rounded off to three decimal
        places. Values are stated in mg </p>
      <p><b><a href="tab2.gif" ">TABLE 2</a></b> </p>
      <p><i>Remark</i>: The variation of Mg in absolute value is very
        slight ()0.0069 rounded to 0.007). The range of values per
        plant, for the four analyses, runs from +0.0059 to - 0.0072
        whence, around the mean there is a dispersion of 0.0065 (also
        rounded to 0.007). That is to say, as a function of experimental
        error, the variation is equal to the dispersion. Fomr this fact
        we conclude that there is no significant variation of Mg, which
        had already been confirmed by a number of previously conducted
        experiments on oats. </p>
      <p><b>(d) Comparison of Variations in K and Ca ~</b> </p>
      <p>In absolute value, K diminishes by 0.033 mg per unit while in
        absolute value, Ca increased by 0.032 mg per unit (between one
        seed and one plant derived from a similar seed). </p>
      <p>Thus there is a definite convergence between these two values,
        which allows us to conclude that the augmentation of Ca comes
        from reduction in K, from which we have the following statement:
      </p>
      <p>K 39/19 + H 1/1 &gt;&gt; Ca 40/20&nbsp; + ~ 0.01 u.m.a. </p>
      <p>In different experiments this compensatory augmentation of Ca
        and reduction of K during germination of oats in an acid culture
        has been observed to approximately ± 4%, reflecting inevitable
        differences due to slight biological variations and experimental
        errors. Again, we can present these values as follows: </p>
      <p>in a seed: K + Ca = 0.140 mg <br>
        in a plant: K + Ca = 0.139 mg </p>
      <p>Indicating that the total amount of K + Ca does not change. or
        even: </p>
      <p>in the seed: K/Ca&nbsp; = 0.113 / 0.027 = 4.2 approximately; <br>
        in the plant: K/Ca = 0.080 / 0.059 = 1.4&nbsp; in excess, </p>
      <p>which again reflects the reduction of K with respect to Ca. As
        K + Ca does not change, the increase of Ca can have no other
        origin than the diminution of K, which makes it useless to look
        for some other origin of Ca. However, as we find certain
        metabolic systems (especially animal systems) in which Ca could
        come from Mg --- by the reaction Mg12 + O8 &gt;&gt; Ca20 --- due
        to complimentary adjustment, research on variation of Mg was
        made one more time, in the experiment commented on herewith, and
        it was discovered to be non-existent. Likewise, other previous
        experiments had shown that there was no significant variation of
        Si during the germination of oats. Bear in mind that a
        calcitropic plant does not manufacture Ca, which must be brought
        to it by the culture medium. </p>
      <p>The values of K and Ca, in both seeds and plants, as set forth
        above, are accepted without reservation because they confirm the
        mean measures supplied by other investigators using a variety of
        different analytic techniques. </p>
      <p>It is noted that in this experiment the relative increase of Ca
        is greater than 118%. The graph in Figure 3 clearly shows the
        reciprocal variations of K and Ca. </p>
      <p><b>(e) Review ~</b> </p>
      <p>For purposes of comparison let us consider a previous analysis
        by neutron activation made by a Swiss government center for
        nuclear research on seeds of a closely related variety, Peniarth
        (mean seed weight 32.2 mg). Analyses were made on five samples
        of six seeds and five samples of six pants each. </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig3.gif" ">FIGURE 3</a></b> </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3 ~</b> Inverse variations of K and of Ca in
        germination of an oat seed (Mg does not vary significantly). <br>
        Mean figures per seed, from 3 analyses and a total of 840 seeds.
        <br>
        Mean figures per plant, from 4 analyses and a total of 403
        plants. <br>
        Analyses of K by flame spectrometry <br>

        (University of Grenoble). <br>
        DK = 0.113 - 0.80 = -0.033 mg <br>
        DCa = 0.059 - 0.027 = +0.032 mg </p>
      <p><b><a href="tab3.gif">TABLE 3</a></b> </p>
      <p><b>Table 3: </b>Batches of 6 Seeds and of 6 Plants (Values in
        mg) </p>
      <p>So again we have an augmentation of Ca in a plant, compared
        with the Ca in a seed similar to the plant’s seed of origin in
        the amount of 0.0560 - 0.0249 = 0.0311 which gives an increase
        of 124%. We are not dealing here with the same plant variety as
        in the preceding experiment, but we see that the order of
        magnitude of variation remains very close to the same. Actually,
        the values obtained in Switzerland were corrected some time
        after issuance of the first analyses because it was noted that,
        because of some germination failure the values reported applied
        not to a total of 30 plants but rather to an average of 28.32
        plants, thus leading to a slight increase in the amount of Ca
        calculated for the plants. Another calculation was added, by
        comparing the content of Ca, not just by the unit (seed or plat)
        but as a function of weights and the values were given in ppm,
        which allows us to compensate the inequalities of weights of the
        samples to obtain a more homogenous result. This led to
        confirmation of a 138% increase of Ca. </p>
      <p>We can briefly add other results showing the convergence of
        values obtained by different laboratories, always with oats: </p>
      <p>1. Nuprime variety, Kervran culture, 42 days; analysis by Dr
        Bieselaar, former lab director of Fraud Service ---- Atomic
        Adsorption Spectrometry; average grain weight 24.65 mg (dozens
        of experiments with this variety have given average weights from
        22 to 25 mg, according to the source of the lots). </p>
      <p>2. Flaningskrone variety; average seed weight: 27.5 mg (has
        varied from 25 to 30 mg according to the source. Ca/seed: 0.028
        ~ Ca/plant: 0.056 ~ Ca change: +0.028 = 100% </p>
      <p>3. Peniarth variety: using neutron activation, 52 day culture;
        Ca/seed: 0.057 ~ Ca/plant: 0.052 ~ Ca change: +0.0263 = 103% </p>
      <p>4. Same variety, dosed by atomic adsorption spectrometry, after
        48 days of culture: Ca/seed: 0.0260 ~ Ca/plant: 0.064 ~ Ca
        change: +0.038 = 146% </p>
      <p>5. Peniarth variety; using neutron activation, Ca/seed: 0.0249
        ~ Ca/plant: 0.0572 ~ Ca change: +0.0323 = 130% </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig4.gif" ">FIGURE 4</a></b> </p>
      <p>All these examples definitely show similar results and an
        average increase in Ca greater than 100%, which is absolutely
        beyond all possible experimental error and confirms the
        "creation" of Ca, pointing to a transmutation. We have seen that
        it begins with K. Dozens of experiments, made up of hundreds of
        analyses, performed by different laboratories using varied
        methods, have been conducted on tens of thousands of oat seeds
        and plants. The phenomenon of transmutation is therefore well
        established beyond doubt. The increase of Ca tends to become
        asymptotic after 5 days too 6 weeks of culture, which implies an
        exhaustion of synthetic hormones during germination. </p>
      <p>A transmutation by a lining organism does not follow the
        classical rules of high energy interaction. Instead it can be
        classified in the category of low energy interactions. The loss
        of mass is not explained by a release of heat and is not
        represented by any radioactivity --- alpha, beta, or gamma. In
        my 1975 book, Costa de Beauregard, Research Director at CNRS,
        showed after the confirmation of "neutral currents" in 1974 that
        the loss of mass is explained by introducing the action of
        neutrinos. Therefore, the loss of mass does respect the
        classical theory of physics. I have added to it the action of
        the neutral intermediate virtual boson vector z, and the
        previously stated reaction could be written as: </p>
      <p>C + K + H +Z<sup>o</sup> / + enzyme &gt;&gt; Ca + v<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>with <i>v</i> prime not equal to <i>v</i> pertaining to
        energy level. The introduction of the H+ proton would be
        explained by the tunnel effect by application of quantum
        mechanics. </p>
      <p>In the above reaction <i>v</i>’ is different from v from an
        energy point of view. The entry of the H+ proton would be
        performed by the tunnel effect in accordance with quantum
        mechanics. </p>
      <p>The text just quoted was released in French from September to
        October 1976. It was soon after translated into English and
        released in the USA by Dr E. Stanton S. Maxey, surgeon and owner
        of a surgical-medical center in Stuart, FL, who has done much
        for the release of my research. </p>
      <p>The above stated results seemed to me definite proof of an
        increase in Ca by an equal reduction in weight of K. I saw,
        therefore, more or less, remarkable support to establish the
        reaction proposed for approximately 15 years, given by the
        formula K + H &gt;&gt; Ca, resulting from a great number of
        observations which all tended to converge on the same
        conclusion. I attributed the slight variations of the numerical
        results to cultural protocol; to slight differences in the
        strength of germination of the seeds; or to non-eligible,
        hard-to-measure cosmic phenomena that have been confirmed
        experimentally by numerous scientists, such as the influence of
        seasonal changes, etc. Subsequent experiments came to confirm
        such results. </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig5.gif" ">FIGURE 5</a> ~ Formation
          of calcium from potassium by the combined action of an enzyme
          and a neutrino.</b> </p>
      <p>The positive charges of the active site of the enzyme repel the
        H+ proton. The result of this electrostatic field is represented
        by H. H does not appear as a label in this figure. [Ed. --- I
        think he means the result of this electrostatic field is felt by
        H, as shown in the figure]. </p>
      <p>The enzyme would concentrate the neutrinos <i>v</i>,
        increasing the chances of impact with the material. </p>
      <p>A neutrino <i>v</i>, adding its effect to the enzyme’s
        positive charges, repels the H+ proton towards the K nucleus
        with sufficient energy for the proton to penetrate the K by the
        tunnel effect. The K atom recoils a little from the shock and
        becomes Ca (K<sup>19</sup> + H<sup>1</sup> &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>20</sup>).





      </p>
      <p>The incident neutrino <i>v</i>, which has accompanied H, does
        not penetrate very far into K. It has given up some energy to H
        and is refracted in K, leaving with a different energy <i>v</i>
        prime not equal to v by carrying off the excess energy resulting
        from the loss of mass between Ca and K + H. </p>
      <p>This re-emitted neutrino <i>v</i> prime will be lost in space
        without reacting with the material. </p>
      <p>But I have never been able to understand why certain
        experiments performed elsewhere seemed to indicate that there
        was not always a one-to-one correspondence in the increase of Ca
        to the decrease in K, the loss of K being insufficient to
        account for the increase of Ca. There was not sufficient
        reduction of Mg or Si to compensate for the increase of Ca. Nor
        did I see any evidence that the analytical methods could be
        blamed. Was I to infer from this that it is probable that we
        have not yet completely mastered the cultural protocols that
        allow us to obtain reproducible results of the K content? </p>
      <p>But it was no longer possible for me, for diverse reasons, such
        as age, health and financial means, to start over again with a
        systematic study of the K life cycle, which would take years. I
        therefore decided to continue only with the research that always
        pointed to an increase in Ca, since Zundel himself was not
        analyzing K, but was instead specializing his research on the
        increase of Ca in oats. There was a restricted but sufficient
        domain here to establish the increase in calcium, and therefore
        the creation of matter in the germination of oats. That is to
        say, there is a biological process of transmutation of matter,
        and that there are other phenomena besides chemistry in living
        things where there is no evidence of high energy transmutation.
        But I thought for the time being that we needed to be
        conservative about the role of K in the formation of Ca.
        Researching the element, or elements originating from Ca is
        quite another problem that young scientists will have to solve
        in the future. </p>

      <p>I introduced this researcher in my book of 1975. J.E. Zundel
        graduated from the Zurich Polytechnicum as a chemical engineer.
        He then trained in the USA. He managed a paper mill, keeping for
        himself the supervision of the chemical analysis laboratory.
        This allowed him to maintain his proficiency in the field of
        chemical analysis for the rest of his life. He had a completely
        open mind and he was a deft experimenter. My first works were a
        revelation to him. He wrote to me as early as 1963. He
        understood immediately that my works pointed to a whole new
        aspect of biology which was of great interest for pulp and paper
        research or on all organic material obtained from vegetable
        fibers. Some alterations in paper could not be explained by
        chemistry alone. Micro-organisms would implant themselves in the
        paper and cause modifications which could not be understood. In
        1963 Zundel began some preliminary verifications of my ideas
        after broaching the subject with me in letters. His work was
        intermittent, because his professional activities did not leave
        him the tie required for continuous research. However, this
        preliminary survey convinced him that my works contained a
        reality, so far ignored by all chemistry treatises and
        specialized periodicals. As soon as he retired, he moved to a
        pollution-free location in the country, half way between Gasse
        and Canes. At his own expense he installed a hydroponic
        experimental station housed in a Vitrex greenhouse. Vitrex is
        made of fine wire mesh dipped into pure Cellophane, a solution
        of pure transparent celluslose. Vitrex is more permeable to the
        solar spectrum than glass. It is well known that glass filters
        some ultraviolet wavelengths. Vitrex is selective to several
        infrared wavelengths which are conductive to the greenhouse
        effect. This Vitrex greenhouse also protected the plants against
        unavoidable small dust particles. Some dust was still brought in
        and out of the greenhouse on shoes and clothing despite these
        precautions. Zundel even worried about dust carried by the wind
        from a quarry located 10 km away. This was indeed improbable,
        but it had to be considered to counter any subjective objections
        raised by the eternal systemic objectors. To present accurate
        digital data, he interspaced his planters with control planters
        filled with pure water. In this way he could accurately measure
        eventual dust fallout. In addition, he equipped a chemical
        analysis laboratory for the measurement of Ca and some other
        elements such as Mg and Si. He personally did the various
        analyses, as he distrusted lab technicians (I appreciate these
        highly qualified technicians. They are very useful
        collaborators. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind the old
        saying: "Better deal with God than with his saints", especially
        in a new field, which has not been taught to them). This hobby
        kept Zundel busy during his retirement. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that Zundel never measured K himself.
        This element is difficult to measure by purely chemical methods.
        At Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, Prof; Baranger. Director of the
        Organic Chemistry Laboratory, also abandoned the various
        chemical methods prescribed in classic analytical treatises
        after he had performed questionable chemical analyses of the
        element K. Subsequently, he used a physical method, fashionable
        at the time, in order to avoid, as he told me, malicious
        comments by his "dear colleagues", always ready to find faults
        in procedures set up by others. Only their method is reliable. I
        will not describe the multiple causes of uncertainty in chemical
        methods. They are usually related to a sequence of the solutions
        ending up with a compound which is insoluble in the next phase.
        Too many chemists forget, in their quest for an element inside a
        seed, that this element is related to different compounds in the
        plant grown from this seed. They reason solely as chemists and
        they forget --- or ignore --- biological phases. For a long time
        now, analyses of K have been performed essentially by flame
        spectrometry techniques (emission spectrometry) which have been
        refined and automated. These techniques are easy to set up with
        a butane or propane flame. However, preparatory steps remain
        delicate for flame spectrometry as for other physical methods. </p>
      <p>When Zundel wanted values for K, he usually would send ash
        samples to a well equipped Industrie du Papier laboratory linked
        to the Ecole Superieure du Papier of the University of Grenoble.
        In these cases, he only mentions the results without lending
        them his support. He only claims as his own the data which he
        obtained himself and checked by a different method. This is the
        case for calcium which he measures following a gravimetric
        method. The samples are weighed on a high precision Sartorius
        scale sensitive to the 1/10 mg. This is sufficient considering
        the quantities involved. Baranger weighed his sample on a
        Mettler scale sensitive to 1/100 mg. Such precision is
        meaningless, because it is subject to gravimetric variations
        such as the distance to the operator. Most recent models were
        calibrated on very heavy bases to minimize the influence of
        distance to the operator. Still the operator should not get too
        close to the scale and he should use proper remote controls.
        Protections are necessary to shield the scale from the
        operator’s body heat and breath. </p>
      <p>Zundel performed tens of thousands of experiments, including
        hundreds of analyses on tens of thousands of seeds to establish
        a procedure guaranteeing reproducibility. He wished then to
        check to results obtained using the method recommended by Prof
        Charlot of Institut de France in his now classic Traite
        d’Analyse in order to eliminate any possibility of error. After
        preparing a sample (an aliquot part) of ashes himself, he had it
        analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrometer at Laboratorie
        des Industries de la Papeterie in Grenoble. It was a
        Perkin-Elmer instrument. I used a Beckman. He had the
        concentrations in Ca and also in Mg, obtained by Charlot’s
        method, tested with this instrument. We will not discuss these
        concentrations here, as the variations in Mg proved to be small,
        if at all significant. The results obtained by Zundel on oats
        regarding Mg confirmed mine. I stated this point in my book of
        1975. This is not the case for the amount of the variations of
        Ca in oats, a calcifuge plant. In calcicole plants the
        metabolism of Mg is totally different. I will not elaborate on
        this subject and I will limit my topic to a wealth of studies.
        In this field it is not permissible to extrapolate results to
        other plant species without having a very large number of data
        taking into account the numerous parameters which should be
        considered in the growing process. </p>
      <p>Zundel used a third method, neutronic activation, in order to
        check his data. He entrusted these analyses to the Institut
        Federal de Recherches sur les Reacteurs Atomiques located near
        Zurich. As Zundel could cross-check the data by three totally
        different methods, he was able to select the experiments which
        gave three sets of compatible figures. Any large discrepancy in
        one of the figures would lead one to suspect an error in the
        analysis by the operator. In this way he happened to detect a
        dilution error in an experiment with the atomic absorption
        spectrometer. Ashes were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and then
        diluted in twice distilled water prior to injection into the
        instrument. The analyzer was programmed to average data,
        measured automatically on ten samples contained in small test
        tubes. In this analysis there were obvious variations in the
        results as compared to those obtained in a large number of
        previous analyses. The operator made the mistake by one order of
        magnitude. Sometimes the error is due to an oversight. For
        example, something sticks in the bottom of the crucible after
        firing. A calibration error is another possible cause, so is a
        zero displacement. These are some of the reasons why one cannot
        rely on a single experiment. </p>
      <p>I will mention again that I performed germination experiments
        on two layers of ash-free filter paper in Petri dishes. I
        measured the total Ca content of plants and paper. In another
        experiment, seedlings were cultivated in the cells of a seedling
        tray which had holes at their bottoms. Operators had neglected
        to measure the Ca which migrated through the roots to the
        underlying water. It was only an error of secondary importance.
        I ascertained that this Ca contained in the water (null at the
        start) represented approximately 10% of the Ca increase in the
        plant as compared to the Ca content of the seed from which it
        originated. This increase was often greater than 100%. However,
        to be rigorously scientific, it was necessary to take into
        account the Ca content of the water. I informed Zundel of the
        necessity to perform such measurements, which were omitted in
        the first experiments. </p>
      <p>In my book of 1975 I only mentioned Zundel’s studies prior
        to1972, at which time he presented a paper to the Academie
        d’Agriculture de France. Zundel did not publish from that time
        until 1979. He pursued his study continuously during the whole
        period. I did not want to publish the results he was sending me
        all along, in order that he would be the first to do so. Also I
        only wanted to comment on data that he had published himself so
        as to have a public database, which would not be the subject of
        objections. I will reproduce below a text printed in 1980 in the
        Rivista de Biologica (quarterly issue, 3rd quarter 1980),
        published by the University of Perugia. This is the original
        text followed by my short commentary which is my sole
        responsibility. </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig7.gif" ">FIGURE 7</a> ~ Hydroponic
          Culture of Grains</b> </p>
      <p>"The planter, presently made of polyethylene, includes a tray
        in which twice distilled water is maintained at a fairly
        constant level. The pH is 6.5. The water level is topped off
        every 3 or 4 days to compensate for plant transpiration. This is
        done by means of a fixed tube linked to the outside by a siphon.
        The external extremity is covered with a test tube as a hood for
        dust protection. The test tube is only removed to introduce the
        pipette for water additions. A multi-cell panel, also in
        polyethylene, is placed on top of the tray. The 75 cells receive
        two seeds each. The roots reach for water into the tray below,
        wile the seeds are maintained outside the water (aerobiea). A
        maximum of 150 seedlings can be grown in each planter. Two
        chambers, as the one reproduced below, are fed in parallel from
        a same air supply. </p>
      <p>"The planter is placed in a closed chamber made of thick, rigid
        Plexiglass 70 x 40 x 30 cm. The box is closed with a removable
        Plexiglass panel after introduction of the planter. This panel
        is fixed by steel clips to one side of the box. It is screwed to
        the box once everything is in place. A gasket insures
        air-tightness between the panel and the box. </p>
      <p>"Air is pumped into the chamber at an approximate rate of 1
        liter/minute by a device which is not represented on the figure.
        The air is pushed through an air filter by an electric
        positive-pressure pump. From the filter it passes successively
        through four one-liter flasks partially filled each with 750 ml
        of twice distilled water. 30 ml of HCl are added to the water of
        the first flask to precipitate any dust (Ca, Mg, etc.) which
        might have escaped through the filter. A check showed that the
        filter was effective. The air is scrubbed in the next two flasks
        filled with solutions of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in order to
        neutralize any acid carry-over. A final scrubbing is made in the
        fourth flasks which contain only pure water. From there are
        filtered and scrubbed air penetrates into the cultivation
        chamber. Air exits the chamber through a double siphon, used
        also as a water gauge. A positive pressure of 3 mm W.G. was
        measured inside the chamber. This way, no external air intake
        may happen accidentally, even with a defective gasket. No Ca,
        for example, can be brought from the outside". </p>
      <p><b>(4) Study of the Variation of Calcium in Oat Seedlings
          During Germination in Twice-Distilled Water, by J.E. Zundel ~</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Abstract:</i> In the course of 60 experiments the Ca content
        of oat seedlings increases by 50-250% during germination in
        twice distilled water. </p>
      <p><i>Introduction:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) This research was carried out over the last 13 years,
        following the publication of works by Monsieur C. L. Kervran.
        These works suggested a possibility of mutation in chemical
        elements by biological means, in contradiction to the law if
        immutability of matter posited by Lavoisier, being understood
        that the law remained fully valid from the chemical point of
        view. Kervran was kind enough to follow my work with interest.
        His considerable knowledge was for me a source of frequent and
        effective advice. </p>
      <p>(2) It was by mistake that I selected oat for my study.
        Initially I was looking for silica in a study which was not
        pursued. Even though the oat was a calcifuge plant, it showed a
        strange increase in Ca which was to become the subject of this
        study. </p>
      <p>(3) It was obvious that this study required the elimination of
        all Ca additions of external origin during the experiments.
        This, I tried to accomplish over the years. </p>
      <p>(4) During the presentation of a paper of a paper to the
        Academie d’Agriculture de France, I was strongly criticized for
        deleting experimental details. I will present them here as
        accurately as possible. </p>
      <p><i>Growing Procedure:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) At the beginning of my work, I was content to use common,
        fodder types of oats. Later the Centre des Semences of INRA
        kindly supplied me with selected seeds: Nuprime, Flamingskrone
        and Peniarth, species I finally adopted definitely for its high
        germinating power. The Warburg and triphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide
        tests showed a germinating power of close to100%. </p>
      <p>(2) After trying several methods (beakers, Petri dishes, flat
        and hollow plates) I selected Mutipot seedling trays,
        manufactured by Ossenberg. </p>
      <p>Each device included a tray ( 30 x 50 x 3 cm) with a panel of
        the same dimensions with 73 cups 40 mm deep which were
        perforated on their bottoms. The assembly was made of PVC. The
        analysis of the trays showed no Ca. </p>
      <p>(3) The seeds were sized by sight with a ± 3% accuracy in
        weight. </p>
      <p>(4) For pre-germination, I cover the bottom of a Multipot
        planter with two layers of ash-free Whatman filter paper and I
        saturate the paper with twice distilled water. I spread over it
        300 selected seeds and I place the assembly in a phytotron.
        Temperature is controlled at 28° C during the 16 daylight hours
        and to 15° C during the 8 night hours. </p>
      <p>During the day, the phytotron is lighted from the outside by a
        400W Power Star Osram lamp. After 5-10 day pre-germination, the
        seedlings are 30-70 mm high. The duration of the pre-germinating
        phase, as well as the size of the seedlings, seem to show that
        besides controllable factors, there are other effects which
        escape me. I then assemble the two parts of another seedling
        tray and I fill it with twice distilled water to a level 4 mm
        above the bottom of the cups. I pull the seedlings carefully not
        to hurt the radicles, and I transplant them two by two in the
        tray. The complete tray holds 146 seedlings. I place the tray in
        the phytotron. </p>
      <p>(5) The seedlings are harvested 28 days after the beginning of
        pre-germination. I selected this time span because it
        corresponded to the average duration of the plants, hence
        probably to the reserves in the seed. I pull the plants
        carefully out of the planter (roots may extend as much as 20 cm
        between the holes at the bottom of the cells and the underlying
        tray. I spread the plants on Whatman filter paper and I dry the
        whole thing at 85 C for 72 hours in an electric autoclave. I
        then grind the plants in a Moulinex coffee grinder and I weigh
        them. </p>
      <p>The water used for the growing process (1,500 ml in average) is
        recovered and concentrated to 50 ml for spectroscopic analysis.
      </p>
      <p><i>Elimination of Extraneous Ca:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) The twice distilled water was supplied by Laboratoires
        Aguettant in Lyon. 3000 ml of this water, reduced to 50 ml, do
        not show any Ca on the Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. </p>
      <p>(2) The glassware is made of pure silica. </p>
      <p>(3) The crucibles are made of platinum, with the exception of
        the ones used to incinerate seeds and plants. For this work I
        used crucibles of pure silica. </p>
      <p>(4) Reagents were supplied by Prolabo and were of analytical
        quality. </p>
      <p>(5) From the beginning of my work, I was afraid of the Ca
        brought in by ambient air. </p>
      <p>Therefore, I placed a tray with the same dimensions, filled
        with HCl, N/10, next to the culture for the duration of the
        experiment. I recovered amounts of Ca corresponding to 2-3% of
        the amounts measured during germination. As an additional
        precaution, I enclosed the seedling trays in polyethylene cases
        and force ventilated with clean air. </p>
      <p>Later I had airtight cases made of Altuglass which also had to
        be ventilated. Finally I acquired a fully airtight phytotron
        (140 x 60 x 50 cm). Its case had a lid made of special
        plexiglass, more permeable than glass to wavelengths below 400
        mm. Lighting was provided by a 400W Power Star Osram lamp
        located 45 cm above the plexiglass panel. This lamp emits a
        fairly uniform spectrum extending into the ultraviolet. The
        light intensity at plant level was approximately 5,000 lux. I
        some experiments I added a Mazda Ultraviolet 20W lamp. </p>
      <p>A small compressor provided air ventilation (2 liters/minute)
        for the phytotron. This air was first filtered in compressed
        pharmaceutical cotton. Air purification was continued by
        scrubbing into two flasks (2 liters) filled with HCl, N/10, one
        flask of concentrated NaHCO3 and one flask of twice distilled
        water. Following some objections, I replaced the cotton filter
        with a Whatman Gamma 12 filter of 0.3 micron porosity. I did not
        find any significant difference in Ca fallouts using these
        various protective methods. </p>
      <p><i>(d) Analyses:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) Samples were weighed on a 0.1 mg Sartorius scale. </p>
      <p>(2) Seed and plant incineration was made in closed silica
        crucibles on low Bunsen flame. </p>
      <p>After distillation, I place the crucible in a slanted electric
        furnace heated to 800 C. Some objections were raised about this
        temperature. However, my own experiments and other experiments
        performed at Laboratoires Techniques du Centre Technique du
        Papier in Grenoble, showed no appreciable differences for
        temperatures of 550 C, 600 C, 800 C, 1050 C. </p>
      <p>(3) Silica was recovered from the solution following the
        Treadwell method. The precipitate incinerated in a platinum
        crucible was weighed and diluted in 5 ml of concentrated HF.
        After vaporization the SiO2 amount was obtained by weight
        difference. </p>
      <p>(4) The determination of Ca (and its separation from Mg) was
        performed by Prof Charlot’s method, as described in his <i>Traite





          de Chimie Analytique Minerale</i>. </p>
      <p>(5) The determination of K was performed by flame spectrometry
        on a Perkin-Elmer instrument at Laboratoires du Centre du Papier
        in Grenoble. </p>
      <p>(6) All data were expressed in milligrams per unit of air-dried
        seeds or plants. </p>
      <p>(7) Some result data was cross-checked by atomic absorption
        spectrometry at Laboratoires du Centre Technique du Papier in
        Grenoble. Generally the values obtained with this method were
        close to my results, although I noted discrepancies as great as
        30%. Nevertheless, percentages of increase in Ca between seeds
        and plants were similar to those I had obtained. </p>
      <p>Additional checks were performed by neutronic activation at
        Centre de Recherches Nucleaires in Zurich. Lesser discrepancies
        were noted, but percentages of increase in Ca were equal to
        mine. </p>
      <p><i>Results:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) All data the least bit suspect of Ca contamination from the
        air was deleted from the table. Consequently, I only mentioned
        the data obtained from experiments in the phytotron and in the
        Altuglas, polyethylene and Vitrex cases. </p>
      <p>(2) As expected plant weights were greater than seed weights
        (photosynthesis) but in an irregular fashion. There were two
        exceptions: item 345, phytotron, in total darkness, and item
        353, Altuglass supplied with air without CO2 (consequently there
        was no photosynthesis in either case). </p>
      <p>(3) Ashes increased. However, item 329, phytotron, was an
        exception. Ashes decreased for no obvious reasons. In seeds, P
        was included in organic compounds (phytins) which disappeared
        during incineration. In plants we found P as a non-volatile
        Ca-phosphate. The other source of weight increase of the ashes,
        was the formation of Ca. Probably from C?, i.e., 2C + O &gt;&gt;
        Ca or 2 x 12 = 16 = 40). It should be noted that the increase in
        ashes is not proportional to the increase in Ca. </p>
      <p>(4) Mg remained identically the same. SiO<sub>2</sub> varied
        slightly in either direction. </p>
      <p>(5) Ca showed a 52-292% increase. Here was one exception for
        item 342, phytotron, additional lighting with an UV lamp and
        addition of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air supply, for which the
        increase in Ca was 556%. This result was checked by
        spectrography and neutronic activation. I could not duplicate
        this result under identical conditions (item 345). This test
        showed only an 88% increase. There was an additional exception
        for item 264, no Co2 and no UV. There was certainly a mistake,
        but I could not locate it. I mention these two experiments as I
        want to be absolutely candid. </p>
      <p>(6) Spectrographic analyses of the water from the culture at
        the end of the growth period showed an average Ca content of
        0.015 mg per plant. Normally I should have added this amount to
        the Ca measured in the plants. I did not do it, because a water
        analysis was not performed for each batch. </p>
      <p>(7) K contents in the plants and in the seeds were different.
        The average variation was of 10%. </p>
      <p><i>(f) Dead Control:</i> </p>
      <p>Tests on dead controls are fairly difficult as there are scores
        of methods to kill a seed. In every case 24 hours at 100° C is
        deadly. 24 hours at 88° C seems to be marginal, as shown by
        successive tests at temperatures progressively approaching 88°
        C. After germinating the seeds for one month, there was no sign
        of life. Ca and SiO2 were the same as in the fresh seeds. </p>
      <p>I tried to kill the seeds with formaldehyde as an alternate
        method. Eight days immersion in formaldehyde were required to
        prevent any germination. There again, Ca and SiO<sub>2</sub>
        were the same as in the living seeds. I pursued the tests with
        gaseous formaldehyde. After a 7-day treatment with the gas, I
        began cultivation. After 30 days there was still no germination.
        The Warburg test was negative. However, the test with
        triphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide was not 100% negative. Therefore,
        a trace of life remained. Ca had increased by 24%, silica was
        unchanged and ashes had increased by 24.4%. </p>
      <p>Finally, I tried a fourth and more drastic procedure. I ground
        the seeds. I wetted the grounds and left them in a calibrating
        glass for 28 days. The ashes had increased by 25%, SiO2 was
        unchanged, and Ca had increased by 12%. </p>
      <p>This test was repeated under identical conditions. It resulted
        in a 17% diminution for the ashes, in no change for SiO<sub>2</sub>,
        and in a 23.5% increase for Ca. </p>
      <p>To me, these tests do not look conclusive. </p>
      <p><i>(g) Reproducibility:</i> </p>
      <p>I entertained great hopes for better reproducibility from
        air-tight lids and from the purification of the air supply after
        obtaining ill-assorted results over the first years of my study.
        This hope was only partially realized. </p>
      <p>The most scattered results were obtained with the phytotron,
        though it provided constant temperature and relative humidity,
        and purified air supply. </p>
      <p>Item 326b: 111% <br>
        Item 329: 52% <br>
        Item 358: 64% <br>
        Item 360b: 204% </p>
      <p>These results are indeed disappointing, but I cannot estimate
        the effect of the parameters influencing the growing process
        besides those which I could control. </p>
      <p>On the other hand I could correlate the results of the three
        other groups: </p>
      <p><i>(a) Altuglass:</i> <br>
        Item 326a: 257% <br>
        Item 351: 271% <br>
        Item 343: 260% </p>
      <p><i>(b) Vitrex:</i> <br>
        Item 254: 115% <br>
        Item 260: 106% <br>
        Item 274: 170% <br>
        Item 271: 97% </p>
      <p><i>(c) Cultures with no photosynthesis:</i> <br>
        Item 315: 54% <br>
        Item 345: 92% <br>
        Item 553: 84% </p>
      <p>Therefore, the results were reproducible under some conditions.
      </p>
      <p>These results appear to show the influence of light. The
        Altuglass, more permeable to light, gives higher results than
        the Vitrex under solar exposure. Another corroboration can be
        seen in tests 360a and 360b performed simultaneously: </p>
      <p>(a) additional UV; increase in Ca: 286% <br>
        (b) no additional UV; increase in Ca: 204% </p>
      <p><i>Conclusion:</i> </p>
      <p>(1) There is always an increase in Ca during the germination of
        oats in twice distilled water. </p>
      <p>(2) It is likely that this increase comes from carbon after the
        pattern: 2C + O &gt;&gt; Ca. </p>
      <p>It seems also likely that this process is produced in two
        phases: the first being supplied by the reserves in the seed,
        the second by photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>(3) Light seems to have an important influence, in particular
        wavelengths below 400 nm. </p>
      <p>(4) Beyond controllable growing conditions one must probably
        accept other influences, yet unknown to me. </p>
      <p>(5) It is regrettable that my means (laboratory, time and age)
        prevented me from performing a series of experiments instead of
        a single exploratory experiment. It would have been possible to
        analyze the data mathematically. Certain discrepancies could
        have been explained, such as the influence of the location of
        the planets during germination, a subject being researched by
        several universities. </p>

      <p><b><a href="tab4.gif" ">TABLE 4</a></b> </p>
      <p><b>(5) Comments on a Study by Zundel on the Increase of Calcium
          in Oats During Germination in Twice Distilled Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>The point of paramount importance in this study, issued during
        the summer of 1979, is the fact that each one of over 60
        experiments shows an increase in calcium in oats, germinated in
        an environment devoid of calcium. This increase varies between
        52 and 292% according to Zundel, and is always of an order of
        magnitude sufficient to rule out statistical errors. </p>
      <p>This test is a summary. It is very short and can be quickly
        read by all. It reports data for only 19 experiments, including
        one on wheat, which I will discard. It is one of a kind and I do
        not have enough precise information from research to establish
        valid comparisons, It would be tiresome to review the separate
        results for all 60 experiments. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that this text shows a long experience with
        chemical analysis on the part of the author. Furthermore, his
        high scientific integrity makes him mention experiments giving
        unequal results. This is really the value of this impartial
        study: it is not the result of an arbitrary data selection. The
        text opens the way to a wide discussion because it presents the
        research in all its complexity. </p>
      <p>The author does not orient his research to obtain a
        reproducibility at all costs. He wants essentially to vary the
        operating conditions. In spite of this, the increase in Ca is
        always large. But what is the source of these variations in
        amplitude? One must look more closely at the factors which
        differentiate the experiments. </p>
      <p>It is seen that the increase in calcium is significantly
        smaller when carbon dioxide is eliminated, inhibiting the
        photosynthesis metabolism. However, too few experiments without
        or with an excess of CO<sub>2</sub> were performed to warrant
        definitive conclusions. The addition of CO<sub>2</sub> is very
        difficult to control. Small amounts must be continuously
        injected. Nevertheless, various other parameters allow one to
        see the importance of the photosynthesis metabolism. </p>
      <p>Let’s compare the dry weights for the seeds and for the plants.
        The photosynthesis cause the synthesis of various carbohydrates
        (glicids, parotids, lipids) which together with the CO<sub>2</sub>
        derived from the air, produce cellulosis, starch, etc. This
        results in an increase of dry matter in the plant. If no
        increase is observed (as is the case for items 346 and 353), it
        must be inferred that the pant lived only on its reserves in
        carbohydrates, which were promptly exhausted. Experiment No. 345
        (darkness) had to be interrupted after 10 days and experiment
        No. 353 (no CO<sub>2</sub>) after 16 days because the plants
        wilted. Due to the abridged growth, the increase in Ca was less
        than 100% in both cases. </p>
      <p>The photosynthesis metabolism is affected by the light spectrum
        which penetrates inside the transparent chamber housing the
        culture. Glass is not the best material. It is known for
        filtering some wavelengths in the ultraviolet. The production of
        Ca is increased if a special UV light is placed inside the
        chamber (experiments 341 and 361a). On the other hand, results
        for no. 347 remain unexplained. This confirms once more that a
        single experiment cannot be relied on in all its details. Did
        anything escape our attention? Zundel acknowledges this point
        when he writes: "besides controllable factors, there are other
        effects which escape me". </p>
      <p>Anomalies of many different origins can happen. This is the
        case for wheat, for which the dry content decreases in the plant
        though the amount of ashes increases. The same happens in
        experiments No. 346 and 353. Sometimes the differences may be
        due to an oversight; some material sticks to the bottom of the
        crucible, for example, and it is only detected during the next
        experiment. </p>
      <p>Some increases in Ca may appear abnormal (experiments No. 264
        and 341) which does not necessarily mean that there is an error
        in the analysis. Regarding No. 341, Zundel comments on this
        aberrant increase, "as I want to be absolutely candid". He cold
        not determine the cause of the aberration. The data obtained by
        Zundelin his own chemical analysis was confirmed by compatible
        results obtained in following two different methods, atomic
        absorption spectrometry and neutronic activation. His shows that
        it was not an error of analysis, which is always possible when
        checks are not made by alternate means. Was the analyzed sample
        abnormally rich in Ca? Why? It is not possible to answer this
        question. Was it due to an accidental contamination during the
        handling of the sample? This is not proven. However, I think
        that such data should only be accepted with reservation. </p>
      <p>In these two experiments it looks obvious to me that all this
        calcium could not come only from a transmutation of K (not
        measured in these two cases to my knowledge). On my side I have
        data on several hundred analyses showing that in one oat seed
        there is not enough K to account for such a weight increase of
        Ca. Could it come from Mg? It looks unlikely, judging from past
        research. From silicium? I do not think so because of various
        experimental reasons. Zundel thought of another cause (2 C
        nuclei rotating around an O nucleus?). I believe that no
        experimental research was ever done along this speculative
        hypothesis. This shows, once again, that one experiment or even
        two do not warrant conclusions, even when the experimenter is
        highly qualified. These 616% and 556% increases in Ca remain an
        enigma. </p>
      <p>There could be some cosmic influences yet undetected. Russian
        Prof Dubrov of the Research Institute of the Globe, Moscow,
        mentioned in one of his books a large variation of Ca in
        synchronism with a large geomagnetic field variation. The
        geomagnetic field itself varies with solar proton showers. Such
        causes are diverse, complex, direct or indirect and above,
        little studied. </p>
      <p>Zundel was intrigued by the 556% increase in Ca, which
        corresponded to additional CO<sub>2</sub> and UV light
        (Ref.341). Is this why he mentioned having duplicated the
        conditions (Ref. 347) --- except perhaps the cosmic conditions?
        He only obtained 88% of increase in Ca. According to him, "there
        is certainly a mistake" in one or both of the experiments. No
        conclusion can be drawn; in any case, this example raises a
        wealth of questions. The importance of the filtering of the
        light spectrum by various materials should be noted. Altuglas
        would appear to be more efficient than Plexiglass. </p>
      <p>Zundel’s study presents many enlightening aspects and this is
        why I take the opportunity to comment on it. A commentary always
        embodies a personal point of view. It is subjective but
        necessary, I think. Zundel made sure he presented a totally
        objective work. It was only right, I think, that I showed the
        reader the lesson to be derived from it, to facilitate the
        thinking process and to aid future experimenters attempting to
        duplicate the experiments. These experiments showed a
        generalized increase in Ca, slightly larger than 100%, after a
        few weeks cultivation in extra-pure water of approximate 5.7 ±
        0.1 pH (in my research). Zundel does not state the pH of the
        water he used, but I know that it was approximately equal to
        this value. </p>
      <p>Note: Zundel’s table shows only the variations of Ca. All these
        data have been checked by alternate methods and they all point
        to the same conclusion. Without quoting data in absolute value,
        Zundel states that average K variations between plants and seeds
        can reach10%. In fact, he had too few data, too widely
        scattered, to attribute a significant value to this figure from
        the mathematical point of view. For K I have the data of many
        other experiments. The uncertain mature of statistics should be
        kept in mind; after all, statistics measure only
        "probabilities". Too often one tends to forget it. Statistical
        computations varied in time and space. Today Gauss curves are
        little used. In France the fashionable method is Fisher’s. This
        method introduces the very arbitrary "Student’s-t". For it, Prof
        Baranger had chosen a value of 1; I chose a value of 5. This
        means that I discounted all variations smaller than 5%, as
        Baranger accepted variations greater than 1%. In Russia the
        Kolmogorov-Smirnovs tests are used: in other countries it may be
        the Kuiper-Stephens method, etc. </p>
      <p><b>(1) About the Dead Control ~</b> </p>
      <p>An objection was that biological transmutation should not be
        observed in seeds which had been killed in dead controls. In
        fact, significant, though small, variations were observed very
        often in the mass of several elements when dead seeds were
        placed in water just like the seeds to be germinated. Therefore,
        some transmutation could not be ascribed to biological effects
        and some people were convinced there were errors in the test
        procedure. </p>
      <p>Zundel also observed the same thing and he mentions the subject
        in his text. However, one observation directed him to a possible
        explanation of the phenomenon: it was noted that dead seeds laid
        in water for several weeks produced a cheesy small.
        Consequently, ferments, yeasts, or micro-fungi had developed on
        the dead material. The transmutation observed, leading to an
        increase in calcium, might be attributed to the action of this
        microflora. This had to be verified. </p>
      <p>For this reason, an antibiotic and fungicidal product,
        kanamycin, was added in a ratio of approximately 10<sup>-3</sup>
        mg/liter. This concentration was recommended by Montuelle and
        Ochin in 1967 to prevent the formation of mold on germinating
        seeds. The presence of mold introduces an uncertainty. Should
        the result be ascribed to the action of seeds or to the action
        of the mold? Tests were made on the European type of oats,
        Peniarth. In the USA, fungicidal tests were performed on the
        local type Montezuma. The fungicide Ceresa was used. All Ca
        increase in the dead controls disappeared. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Cosmic Effects ~</b> </p>
      <p>Zundel mentions "unknown parameters" to explain quantitative
        variations. In a figure in my book of 1975, I stated that I
        started the germination process at the new moon and that I
        harvested 6 weeks later at the full moon. I did this in order to
        operate (hopefully) under comparable cosmic conditions for each
        experiment though I could not establish this point in any
        significant manner. At least for certain plants, the action of
        the moon is well known among farmers and gardeners. However, it
        was not clear for oats. The biological transmutation seemed to
        depend on other causes which I did not have the time to isolate.
        The action of the moon on tides is well known, but its effect on
        oat seemed to be variable. </p>
      <p>A book published by Robert Frederick around 1980, <i>L’Influence
de
la






          Lune sur les Culture</i> states that oat is an exception, that
        it might be more sensitive to some cosmic rays. However, it does
        not appear that the author tried to determine which ones. One
        must also consider solar action, which shows its effects on high
        equinoxial tides. The effect of solar proton showers was studied
        in particular by Prof G. Piccardi of the Institute of Physics
        and Chemistry of Florence, Italy. In Russia this effect was
        studied by Prof Dubrov of the Globe Geophysical Institute of
        Moscow, etc. The research should be pursued for specific vegetal
        species and it should not be limited to solar effects. This
        research should be placed in the framework of biorhythms which
        more and more, are shown to have an important effect on all
        earthly life. This point is still ignored by some technocrats
        who play with time as they see fit while giving fallacious
        arguments. However, this is not the place to prove this point. </p>

          of Ca after Dubrov</b> </p>
      <p><b>(6) Comments on Some Experiments ~</b> </p>
      <p>I will not go into the details of all the experiments
        performed; this would lead to tiresome repetitions. I would like
        to draw some lessons from the statistical data collected on tens
        of thousands of oats after hundreds of analyses of oats after
        hundreds of analyses on oat and oat seedlings. The information
        mentioned below is important, because it constitutes a base of
        preset references to verify if an analysis has been properly
        made. This is a point of the utmost importance for all
        researchers in order to avoid hasty and erroneous conclusions,
        some of which I noted in the research by students in national
        schools of agriculture or in public high schools which train
        superior technicians for agriculture. I noted the same trend
        among students as well as professors in schools of sciences in
        universities. I also saw so many engineers, considering
        themselves as specialists or experienced professionals, commit
        serious errors. These errors looked shocking to me as these
        people were in known territory, but apparently it was unknown,
        because they were prejudiced by previous experience. </p>
      <p>I believe it is important that each set of seeds in a good stat
        of health and of approximately the same size. Each set should be
        prepared by the same operator. Unfortunately, in some schools
        several students prepare sets of seeds for the research which to
        be the subject of a dissertation or a thesis. Under these
        conditions, there are unacceptable differences between tests.
        Sometimes I noted weight variations reaching 20% and more, which
        biased the results. Each set should be weighted to 1/10 mg for
        control, as long as each set does not contain more than a few
        hundred seeds. Weighing should be done to the milligram when a
        few thousand seeds. The statistical average is then valid,
        barring bad luck. It is advisable to always avoid seeds of a
        common grade and to use selected seeds. Even if they first
        underwent mechanical selection. One must do this for several
        reasons: </p>
      <p>(a) There are large differences between old species of black
        oats (some are still sown today, such as the Noire de Prieure
        for example) and a modern hybrid light seed. The differences can
        be as great as 100%. Often a species degenerates in less than 10
        years. This was the case in the past for the black winter oats
        that we used. These seeds each weighted 44 mg in average. For
        the light Nuprime species hundreds of seeds showed an average
        individual weight of about 21-25 mg (depending on the origin). </p>
      <p>(b) Black oats are winter grains. They grow well only if they
        are sown in the fall and only if they have spent the winter in
        the ground. The cold weather effect is absolutely necessary for
        a good start in the spring. It is called wintering. This phase
        in the enzymatic modification of molecular structures under the
        action of cold is seen as an absolute necessity, but the
        wintering is not yet well understood. Consequently, one should
        not forget to expose the seeds to artificial cold for several
        weeks when cultivating them in a laboratory. Too often,
        physicists neglect this step. On the other hand, spring oats and
        most light oats do not require wintering. Light oats can
        germinate at any time. Some precautions must be taken, such as
        varying the daily light exposure. There may be other cosmic
        effects, still unknown and little studied. Studies on this
        subject were made in Russia, Italy and Belgium. In France this
        research was mainly done by Prof Faussurier, Director of the
        Physics Laboratory at Faculte Catholique of Lyon. He used
        chromatographic techniques on metallic salt-impregnated paper in
        order to correlate color changes in the paper with cosmic
        phenomena which had been recorded by various observatories.
        There are still other effects, still unknown, which produce
        barely significant variations. </p>
      <p>(c) In light all season oats, I stopped the research on the
        Panche de Roye species for two reasons: in this species the
        glume (also commonly called chaff) is well developed. It is
        necessary to eliminate it to avoid complicating the research
        after germination. Some agronomists maintain that the glume must
        be left because it participates in the germinating process. In
        my research, its effect on mineral balances and germination
        power always looked negligible. </p>
      <p>In this variety there are two seeds in one envelope. Nine times
        out of ten, one is significantly smaller than the other. It is
        then necessary to open the glume to extract the larger seed,
        which complicates the operation. From the beginning this is why
        I concentrated my research on so-called naked or glumeless
        species, such as Nuprime which is cultivated in France and other
        countries mainly to make rolled oats. Later I used Flamingskone
        and Peniarth because I observed that Nuprime degenerated and was
        giving only 70% germination. One should use seeds sized and
        selected by a special section of INRA and with a minimum
        guaranteed ratio of 95%. </p>
      <p>As a general rule, it is preferable to express analytical data
        in per unit values --- one seed, one plant. For comparative
        purposes one can indeed use equal weights and use the milligram
        or the gram as the unit of measure. However, when a seed does
        not germinate, germinates poorly or becomes moldy, the whole
        data for the seed is void. Therefore, the unit chosen should be
        the seed, except in experiments involving thousands of seeds. If
        one seed in a set of 100 does not germinate, the uncertainty is
        of 1%. Germinating ratios for the best seeds can only be
        guaranteed to 95%, leaving an excessive uncertainty of 5%. This
        is why I always insisted that sets prepared for cultivation
        always include several hundred seeds. How conceited on the part
        of researchers in Europe and America to be satisfied with sets
        of 20 or 30, sometimes less. In one experiment, for example, 6
        seeds were left at the bottom of a test tube where they poisoned
        each other with the gases from their metabolism, causing a
        defective synthesis of growth hormones, etc. If a single seed
        out of 6 does not grow properly, a 16% uncertainty ensues. This
        is unacceptable. Unfortunately, these concepts of vegetal
        physiology are too often ignored by many physicists who only
        reason in the mathematical abstract. Many chemists specialized
        in inorganic analysis do not know biochemistry. </p>
      <p>Personally, I always used sets of at least 50 seeds and several
        sets in parallel. Zundel often germinated batches of about 145
        seeds each. He analyzed each set separately. he had two trays in
        operation for a total of approximately 300 seeds. </p>
      <p>To avoid an uncertainty of up to 5% due to deficient seeds, it
        seems advisable to sue pregerminated seeds. To this effect, a
        number of seeds significantly higher than the number to be
        cultivated, is germinated. The seeds are placed between two
        sheets of filter paper of the so-called ashless quality. The
        seeds should not touch each other. The paper is soaked with
        twice distilled water continually; it is sprayed twice a day.
        Seeds germinate. After 4 days, the shoot (radicles, etc.) is a
        few millimeters long. Seedlings, which have germinated normally
        and are of comparable lengths, are then selected.&nbsp; One is
        reasonably sure to deal with seedlings of equal vigor. Each
        seedling is carefully transplanted in a seedling tray. An equal
        number of seedlings, as similar as possible, are selected, dried
        and analyzed for their respective contents in Ca, K, Mg, etc. An
        observation of the results shows that there s no appreciable
        difference in the weights of these minerals between fresh seeds
        and pregerminated seedlings. The synthesis of new minerals
        starts only after 5 or 6 days. It is therefore necessary not to
        overextend the pregermination period. After 15 days, for
        example, the difference in Ca is significant. This appears
        clearly in the curves we traced for calcium. Other cations and
        anions have also changed at the end of this period. </p>
      <p>Hundreds of experiments showed that the relative contents of
        the major minerals in the seeds varies from one variety to the
        next. This is why some varieties are preferred when looking for
        specific elements. In the same species, variations may exceed
        20% according to the variety. However, the composition spectrum
        is a characteristic of the species. In the same variety,
        relative variations between elements can reach approximately 5%.
        This is due to differences in the cultivated terrain, in soil
        composition, in the climate, in average seasonal temperature, in
        insulation, moisture, etc. This constant value of no more than ±
        15% allows one to detect significant errors in the analyses. For
        example, with Nuprime seeds, I found the average seed weights of
        22 mg (± 10%) according to the origin of the batch. The average
        Ca content was about 0.025 mg, or about 1/1000th of weight of
        the seed. With Peniarth seeds, the average Ca content per seed
        was 0.029 mg for an average seed weight of 28 mg, ± 1 mg. These
        measurements were made on thousands of seeds from the same crop.
        Some years I happened to note that the average Ca content for
        the same variety was lower by a few points than the 1/1000th of
        the weight of the fresh seed in Ca. This is due to climactic
        conditions during the year, or to the area of origin of the
        crops, or to intangible cosmic factors. This is of little
        importance. </p>
      <p>On the contrary, if data differ by ± 15%, we can state that
        there was an error in the analysis, in calibration or in the
        preparation of the samples for the analysis, I have seen
        variations greater than 10%, which did not seem to worry the
        researcher. </p>
      <p>Often it is interesting to take into account the normal K
        content and to compute the K/Ca ratio in the seed and in the
        seedling. For complementary information one may also look at
        K/Mg and Mg/Ca. This can lead to the detection of an error. In
        oats K/Ca is found to be close to 4.8 ± 0.5 with minor
        variations according to the species. This shows that the
        calibration probably is correct. However, comparisons with other
        analyses are indispensable, because errors in acid dilution may
        have occurred prior to injection into the analyzer. The K/Ca
        ration is not an absolute criterion of the validity of an
        analysis, but it often gives a good clue. </p>
      <p>To illustrate this point: in an engineering school a student
        found an average Ca weight of 0.021 mg and an average K content
        of 0.078 mg per seed on 9 batches of Nuprime oats. This gave
        K/Ca of 3.72, which was a little too low. Elsewhere, several
        analyses of Peniarth seeds coming from the same stock gave
        average values respectively of 0.0273 mg for Ca and 0.1130 for
        K, or K/Ca = 4.1. This showed that the analyses of K and Ca were
        only marginally acceptable and that they had to be
        cross-checked, as ratios were found to vary with the species. </p>
      <p>In Switzerland in 1974 a study made at a government laboratory
        by means of neutronic activation gave the following respective
        results for each of the 5 analyses: K/Ca= 4.5, 4.7, 4.6, 5.2 and
        5.0, or an average of 4.8. It is a good average. However, the
        batches included only 6 seeds each and the accuracy of the
        analysis was only of 4%. The laboratory then made a correction
        for the seeds which had been poorly germinated. Computations
        were made on the base of 28.32 instead of 30. After correction
        the experiment showed an increase in Ca of 138%. In a French
        agricultural engineering school in 1973, the analysis of 9
        batches of 30 seeds each (a slightly low number) of Nuprime oats
        showed average K and Ca of respectively 3.42 and 0.61 mg per
        seed, or a K/Ca ratio of 5.6. This was slightly too high a
        figure, perhaps because of an excessive K (calibrating error?)
        but in my judgment certainly because of an underestimation of
        Ca, due to an inappropriate measuring procedure for Ca. The
        measurements were made with a flame spectrometer. For divalent
        elements there is a risk that the number of atoms with no
        peripheral electrons is too small to yield reliable
        measurements. In a West German university, a study made by a
        student on Peniarth oats gave a Ca&nbsp; content of 29.5
        micrograms, a figure which seems too high for seeds with an
        average unit weight of 21.36 mg. It is almost certain that an
        error was made on the K content, given as 118.36 micrograms.
        This leads to a K/Ca ratio of 4.0, which is too low, but shows
        that errors on K and Ca can compensate each other. Therefore, it
        is necessary to do several cross-checks. I will not mention any
        figures for a study made in a university in the USA, because the
        results are certainly wrong. Though one might have reservations
        on x-ray fluorescence measuring techniques with K and Ca, this
        time the error came from a mistake in the growing procedure.
        Cultivation was made under artificial lighting with a lamp
        giving a completely inappropriate spectrum. This resulted in
        deficient photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>A set of studies on 10 batches of Peniarth oats coming from the
        same stock gave 3.9 for K/Ca. Several months later 8 batches
        from the same stock led also to K/Ca = 3.9, showing first that
        there had been no drift in the composition and second that the
        concentrations were a little too low for this species. Usually
        the average figure gravitates around 4.8 ±10%. An error could
        have happened either in the growing procedure or in the
        analysis. Once again we see that errors compensate for each
        other, which makes cross-checks necessary. </p>
      <p>An easy cross-check of the data in a study is provided by the
        seedlings’ dry weight. It must be greater than the seeds’ dry
        weight because with good growth, there is production of
        carbohydrates (starch, cellulose and other glucids, lipids and
        parotids) due to seedling growth. This is due to the
        photosynthesis metabolism. The weight increase was observed and
        measured as early as the 17th century. Nevertheless, I noted
        that some French and some foreign researchers mentioned figures
        showing no increase in the weight of dry material. Some even
        showed a decrease. This points to an error in the growing
        procedure. This did not even catch the attention of these
        researchers. I will come back later to the importance of good
        photosynthesis. I would like to say here that only dry weights
        can be validly considered. Long discourse on the necessity of
        stabilizing the weights according to the humidity are without
        merit, because moisture in the laboratory varies with the
        season, etc., and comparisons between successive experiments are
        not valid. Dessication standards should be set. </p>
      <p>Even the weight of ashes is found to be higher for seedlings
        than it is for seeds in most cases; this may be attributed to
        methods of analysis inappropriate for these types of studies.
        For example, in chemical analyses of ashes, losses of phosphorus
        and sulfur, among others, during firing are often forgotten.
        Some compounds become volatile at fairly low temperatures,
        sometimes as low as 200° C, which is insufficient to obtain good
        ashes. One forgets also that calcium sulfates and phosphates in
        some cases are insoluble in the acid used and they may be formed
        during seedling growth. In these cases there is an excess of
        ashes, but the amount of calcium is underestimated by the
        quantity which remains insoluble. This shows that many chemists
        do not know their trade. If hydrochloric acid, often used, does
        not give satisfaction, even if it has been heated, then other
        acids, such as sullfo-nitro-perhydric acid or hydroperchloric
        acid should be used for the tests. However, we should not forget
        that these acids are potentially explosive and they are
        difficult to handle. Usually hydrochloric acid will do, but it
        is a good precaution to test the potential margin of error to
        see if it is acceptable. Physical analytical techniques applied
        to dried, instead of incinerated, powders can be used to
        circumvent these difficulties. However, with some techniques
        involving the use of physics instruments, solution is still part
        of the procedure and the dissolving power should be taken into
        consideration. No such problem occurs with spectrometers when
        the powder is sparked. </p>
      <p>Some of the figures mentioned in various studies are so
        obviously wrong! Such is the case in a study made in a German
        university on 192 Flamingskrone oat seeds and 190 seedlings.
        After 49 days of growth the following data was reported: </p>
      <p>Average dry weight of each seed: 21.77 mg, and <br>
        Average dry weight of each seedling: 32.67 mg. </p>
      <p>Data reproduced without comments. </p>
      <p>There is certainly an error. Furthermore, the contents
        mentioned for Ca, mg and K are questionable. All these figures
        are smaller than corresponding figures for the seeds, though the
        total weight increased. The Mg/Ca ration is completely abnormal.
        Other cross-checks show that the figure for Mg is much too low,
        and that the figure for Ca is too high. Evidently this student
        did not master the analytical technique he was using. In an
        American university we saw similar results, although the
        supervising professor did not make any comments. Every result
        should be cross-checked. </p>
      <p>In another university department the following values were
        quoted in micrograms, per Peniarth seed: </p>
      <p>K = 11.4; Mg = 33.7; Ca = 29.5, which gives: <br>
        K/Ca = 4.0; K/Mg = 3.5; Mg/Ca = 1.1. </p>
      <p>K/Ca is almost normal. This might lead one to believe that K
        and Ca were fairly accurately measured. However, if: </p>
      <p>K/Ca = 4 and K/Mg = 3.5, it is impossible to have Mg/Ca = 1.1 </p>
      <p>A French researcher told me that he found the following
        relations: </p>
      <p>K = 0.113; Mg = -.030; Ca = 0.027 <br>
        K/Ca = 4.1 (about normal); K/Mg = 3.6, and Mg/Ca = 1.1. </p>
      <p>These values are very close to those quoted previously and show
        an error of the same order of magnitude in Mg. </p>
      <p>In official tables for an unidentified species and following
        analyses by purely chemical means, K/Ca is given as 7.03, which
        is too high. This shows that the value measured for Ca was too
        low, because Mg/Ca is given as 2.5. If Ca is too low, then Mg is
        also too low, as the K/Mg is given as equal to 3. At the minimum
        the chemical analysis of Ca and Mg should be checked. It is
        likely that Ca and Mg were not properly separated (probably with
        oxalate?). This would explain the errors in the three reports
        mentioned. </p>
      <p>Experiments correctly performed show that K + Mg + Ca + Na is
        approximately constant for a given species and no additional
        fertilizing elements are brought in. Whatever the species, one
        can favor any cation by selection. Na varies a great deal in
        relative value (often 50-60%), but we neglected it because it is
        very small in absolute value in vegetals. Therefore, it is
        permissible to only measure and compare K + Mg +Ca. Many
        experiments showed that Mg does not vary significantly in oats.
        For oats it is therefore sufficient to compare only the values
        of K + Ca to detect gross errors in tests or analyses. I also
        neglect Si, which shows small variations in relative value.
        However, these variations are often interesting to study, as
        observed by Vauquelin in 1799. Please refer to my book of 1975.
      </p>
      <p>By rounding off the numbers in the previous example, one
        obtains K + Ca = 0.14 mg in the seeds as in the seedlings. This
        leads one to infer that the analyses are correct in both cases
        (there is a small error for Mg). On the other hand, I noted an
        error in a study made in a foreign university in which K + Ca
        was given as 0.154 mg for seeds and only 0.145 mg for seedlings.
        In this test there was less Mg in the seedlings as well, and the
        researcher did not notice that all the elements were in smaller
        quantities, although the dry weight had increased by
        approximately 50%. With such comments one can appreciate the
        validity of experiments. If Mg is also measured, we will note
        again that the three ratios, K/Ca, K/Mg and Mg/Ca help to
        determine which cation was in error. I shall mention again that
        I gave the following figures for the Flamingskrone variety: </p>
      <p>Seed: 0.1130 K + 0.0273 Ca = 0.1403 Total <br>
        Seedling: 0.0799 K + 0.0590 Ca = 0.1389 Total </p>
      <p>By rounding off to the third decimal: </p>
      <p>In the seed the total is 0.140 <br>
        In the seedling the total is 0.139, </p>
      <p>which is a close match. We can refer to numerous and various
        cross-check performed on tens of thousands of seeds of various
        species. However, in seedlings, the dispersion of the
        measurement is often considerable due to differences in growing
        procedures: light spectrum through various materials, etc. In
        any case K + Ca should remain nearly the same in the seed and in
        the seedling. If not, one should try to determine the cause of
        the error, if possible. </p>
      <p><b>(7) Reservations on Some Analytical Techniques ~</b> </p>
      <p>Several times I pointed out that a physical analysis technique,
        requiring the most modern and sophisticated instrumentation,
        could not always be accepted without reservations. One must
        always cross-check the results by completely different
        techniques. For example, I mentioned the case of an error due to
        a wrong dilution during an analysis by atomic absorption
        spectrophotometry. For comparative purposes, the gas pressure
        fed from a liquid acetylene supply, the gas flow to the Bunsen
        burner, etc., should be recorded. So should the lanthanum
        concentration in the buffer solution, which prevents
        interferences by some unwanted elements. I also pointed to some
        sources of error in electronic transducers connected to a
        computer. Each class of instruments has limits. I do not
        question how the figures were obtained, however they are not
        always reliable. </p>
      <p><b>(8) One Example With X-Ray Fluorescence ~</b> </p>
      <p>There are crazes, fashions and also habits peculiar to the
        laboratory or to the operator. In Figure 9, I show an example of
        a curve obtained by x-ray fluorescence from dry ground oats in
        the nuclear physics laboratory of an American university. It was
        taken from recording made in 1976 of the simultaneous
        measurements of K and Ca. The continuous curve corresponds to
        the actual measurement. It seems that, starting with an atomic
        mass of 41, the K peak has a steeper slope. Studies have shown
        that this is due to the Ca curve which contributes to the sharp
        rise in the K curve. The K peak is not a line. It spreads widely
        and masks the curve for Ca. Computation factors fed into the
        computer are somewhat arbitrary, because they may vary according
        to the material analyzed. For this reason the final result may
        be right or wrong. A cross-check by a different technique is
        necessary, no matter how carefully the calibration was performed
        (as the zero adjustment of a pH meter, in the case of a
        relatively simple instrument). The values for the K peak and for
        the Ca peak (dotted line) are good. A similar analysis was
        performed after the germination of the seeds. For the species
        tested, it showed an increase in Ca of 125% corresponding to an
        equivalent decrease in K, which confirmed the correlation
        between the two elements. </p>

      <p><b>Additional Information On Physical Phytochemistry During
          Germination ~</b> </p>
      <p>Too many physics specialists are tempted to simplify vegetal
        biology processes and they select germination procedures in
        which normal reactions cannot develop. This results in distorted
        data. I do not intend to give a detailed study of this topic,
        but I want to describe a few steps in the preliminary study.
        This study is essential if valid experiments are to be achieved.
      </p>
      <p><b>(1) Summary of the Germinating Phases of Grain Seeds ~</b> </p>
      <p>When the seed is exposed to a temperature of 15-20° C and to
        the proper moisture (close to 100%), the embryo produces which
        migrate toward an external layer of the seed, located under the
        tegument and made of aleurone cells. There the hormones cause
        the formation of various types of hydrolytic enzymes which
        circulate between the cells in the core of the seed (endosperm).
        These cells constitute the reserves of the seed. The enzymes
        destroy the walls of the cells and transform starch and
        proteins. Under the action of diastase, starch is transformed
        into various sugars. </p>
      <p>An enzyme cannot act if the cell structures constitute an
        impermeable barrier and prevent the enzyme from reaching the
        substances it is supposed to transform. This is why some enzymes
        must first transform the walls of the grains of starch. There
        is, therefore, a programmed sequence of enzymatic actions. The
        product of a reaction with an enzyme constitutes the substrate
        for the next reaction, which includes a spatial modification of
        the molecular structure. Successive enzymes are prepared and
        they become available at the right time, so that the effective
        section of interaction with cosmic neutrinos is continuously
        changing. </p>
      <p>In the fresh seed, the external envelope, or tegument, provides
        a mechanical protection for the endosperm, which constitutes the
        reserve of food. The embryo is located at one end, and is also
        protected by the tegument, from which the roots and leaves will
        sprout. As early as the second day, the embryo synthesizes a
        growth hormone, gibberellin. This can only be done in the
        presence of water and under favorable temperature conditions. It
        acts as some sort of a messenger for RNA which reaches the
        aleurone layer in a few days (1-2 days). There it produces the
        synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes, which will transform the
        structure of the grains of reserve proteins. These proteins
        include avenin (in oats) in addition to structural proteins, the
        glutelins. The endosperm cell walls are mainly constituted of
        beta-glucane chains, which are glucose polymers, close to
        cellulose, linked by very short peptid chains. </p>
      <p>One of the effects of seedling growth is the decomposition of
        these various constituent elements into small molecules. A few
        hours after the seed is moistened, the peptid links between the
        beta-glucane elements are broken by an enzyme, carboxypeptidase.
        The degrading process develops step by step. A whole series of
        enzymes act specifically on the internal links as soon as they
        are in contact with the products decomposed by the previous
        enzyme, and they produce various sugars. During that time, other
        still relatively unknown enzymes decompose the pentosanes,
        breaking the walls of the starch grains. Once the cellular walls
        are broken, other proteins interact with starch, which is
        converted into glucose. During this time, the gibberellin
        migrates to the opposite end of the seed (the distal area) over
        a period of 10 days, transforming almost all the aleurone cells
        at the back of the seed. By that time almost all of the starch
        has been structurally transformed. The transformations are by
        then macroscopically significant, to the point of making
        variations in the seed chemical composition measurable. We
        published curves showing the abrupt changes which happens after
        about 10 days of germination. </p>
      <p>After two days, the tip of the embryo starts to emerge from the
        tegument. On the average, the radicle length is 2-3 cm after 4
        days. The embryo has eaten close to one-half of the starch by
        this time. After 8 days, the radicle has 608 offshoots and
        almost all the starch has disappeared. Enzyme activity is then
        fully accelerating and analyses show very significant biological
        transmutations. It is at this time that the photosynthesis
        contributes its effects as leaves are already well developed.
        This results in a sharp rise in the calcium content shown in our
        curves around 8-10 days. Analyses made at short time intervals
        show that seed compounds are not appreciably modified until the
        fourth day. For the purpose of comparing Ca contents, after 28
        days for example, it is legitimate to select the seeds which
        sprout well after 4 days of pregermination. It is understood
        that no Ca should be brought from the outside during that time.

      <p><b>(2) Average Curve of the Increase in Calcium of Oats After
          Germination ~</b> </p>
      <p>To my knowledge, about 60 experiments were performed over the
        last 10 years on the germination of oats to study the increase
        in calcium in hydroponic cultures. This was done over a period
        of several weeks without external addition of Ca. </p>
      <p>These experiments required over 400 analyses by different
        physical or chemical techniques. These analyses were made on
        tens of thousands of seeds or seedlings. The increase in Ca is
        measured by comparison after analyses of a seedling and of a
        seed similar to the one from which the seedling originated. This
        is to say that the phenomenon was studied for a long time and
        that it is firmly established. </p>
      <p>It seems of interest together the results from approximately 40
        experiments especially well performed on light hybrid species
        only. Their seeds are small and generally more homogeneous than
        the big black seeds produced by old varieties. Nuprime,
        Flamingskrone and Peniarth varieties were primarily used in
        these experiments. The seeds weighed approximately 20-30 mg
        according to the species and the batch. They were calibrated to
        1 mg after selection in batches of 100-300 seeds. Some analyses
        involved batches of more than 1000 seeds. The units retained
        here for comparative purposes are the seed and the seedling
        grown from a seed, because they represent the minimum biologic
        quantum of enzymatic action. If a seed does not germinate, the
        whole weight of the seed remains inactive. However, seed weights
        should always be noted to allow comparisons between batches of
        various origins and varieties. In the light hybrid varieties
        considered, the Ca content represents approximately 1/1000th of
        the weight of the seed. This figure is based on tens of
        thousands of seeds. A fresh seed with an average weight of 25 mg
        will have roughly a calcium content of 0.025 mg. </p>
      <p>Figure 11 summarizes the data obtained after about 40
        experiments. This does not mean that each point of the curve
        corresponds to an average of 40 analyses (by different
        techniques and on several varieties). Most experiments involve
        only the analysis of Ca in non-germinated seeds, and then on the
        seedlings grown from similar seeds and harvested after 4, 5 or 6
        weeks. Experiments, in which seedlings were sampled after 2-3
        weeks, are few; the majority of the data is related to seedlings
        cultivated over 4-7 week periods. However, data collected either
        during a short experiment or sampled after a few weeks from a
        batch left under culture, are compatible and they allow one to
        draw the curve in the appendix. </p>
      <p>This does not mean necessarily that every figure found for Ca
        in a new experiment or a given duration will be located on this
        curve. It is an average for several varieties obtained by means
        of various analytical techniques. The dispersion inherent to
        biological batches of different vigor should always be taken
        into consideration. Nevertheless, the effects of all these
        elements should not cause a variation greater than 15-20% from
        this curve even if they are cumulative. Hence, this curve can be
        used as a guide in this type of research, to detect a major
        error in the procedure or in the analysis. We established it for
        this purpose. It is a piece of information and it gives an
        indication about the magnitude of the phenomena involved in the
        production of Ca under the effect of growth hormones. One should
        note the asymptotic trend of the curve after 2 months of growth
        (these spring oats are normally harvested 4-5 months after
        sowing). The growth metabolism is only active during half the
        life of the plant. Growth hormones (gibberellin, auxins)
        synthesize the enzymes for the plant anabolism during
        germination. The curve shows that the Ca formation is
        quantitatively linked to the activity of growth hormones until
        exhaustion at the point of maturity (1) </p>
      <p>[(1) The diminishing in growth of Ca production may come from
        Ca saturation in the plant which, in turn, affects the enzyme.
        The saturation is reached after 8 weeks with a K/Ca ratio
        approximately equal 1.5. In the seeds the K/Ca ratio is
        approximately 4.5. The transmutation of K into Ca stops when the
        two elements are about equivalent in weight. That would be at
        the time of maturity, when the growth hormones effects have
        ended. </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig11.gif" ">FIGURE 11</a> ~
          Augmentation of Ca in Oats</b> </p>
      <p>However, one should not infer that the production of enzymes
        alone can explain the energy balance for the transmutation which
        leads to the production of Ca. The enzyme production constitutes
        an essential element because a seed which does not germinate,
        does not produce any biological transmutation. The question of
        energy does not have a place here. I only wished to present an
        objective document on the data obtained as reference for future
        research. </p>

      <p>In one of my early books I mentioned a 17th century experiment
        made a Flemish physician, Jean-Baptiste Helmont, in which he
        planted a 5 lb willow tree in a planter containing 200 lb of
        soil. The planter was covered with a lid with two holes, one for
        the trunk and the other for watering the tree. The purpose of
        the lid was to prevent any changes in the weight of the soil by
        dust from the atmosphere. After 5 years the tree was uprooted
        and weighed. It weighed 164 lb. However, the weight of the soil
        had only decreased by 2 oz. Helmont did not find any
        satisfactory explanation for this observation. Photosynthesis
        was then unknown. </p>
      <p>For a long time the study of the phenomenon remained sketchy.
        From time to time crazy results were quoted in quasi-official
        documents, without attempted justification. For example, it was
        stated without comment that soils were improved by bamboo trees
        (1969). Oureschi, Yadar and Prakash observed that the species
        Bambusa Tulda gave back to the soil more calcium than it took.
        Other bamboo species, such as <i>Nechouzeana Dulloa</i> and <i>Oxytenanthera






          Nigrociliata</i>, "give back more magnesium" --- from <i>Nature






          and Resources</i> No. 4, p. 15 (1975), UNESCO Publications. </p>
      <p>But it was only during the 70’s that the mechanism of
        photosynthesis was studied more thoroughly. It was finally
        understood why monocotyledons exposed to atmospheric carbon
        dioxide gave compounds which differed from compounds found in
        dicotyledons, C4 compounds in the first case versus C3 in the
        second. This explained differences in behavior and yield among
        various families. Some plants growing on salty soils follow the
        C4 cycle due to a specific effect of Na. This is also true of
        many weeds. They take more carbon from the ambient air, and
        therefore need less fertilizer than plants with a C3 cycle. In
        addition, they produce more dry matter and consume less water.
        We will study the role of photosynthesis more closely, a subject
        still ignored too often by many agronomists, because it was not
        taught to them. </p>
      <p><b>(1) Effects of Artificial Lighting in the Photosynthesis,
          for the Study of Transmutations by Cereal Plants ~</b> </p>
      <p>Many experiments were performed in various countries at various
        times to study the transmutation of particular elements during
        plant germination. </p>
      <p>Usually they were performed under natural light. With the
        development of this research, a problem related to the use of
        artificial light arose. It was used in particular for the
        studies on the germination of cereal grains, especially of oat
        and wheat. </p>
      <p>These grains, as well as barley and rye, are said to have long
        day cycles. This means that they grow in daylight and reach
        their maturity shortly after the longest days in the year.
        Ideally they need 13-15 hours of daylight in French latitudes,
        16 hours in more northern latitudes. </p>
      <p>For this reason, the research on transmutations, which are
        produced at the peak of the enzymatic activity (strong growth of
        the plant) is distorted when laboratory experiments are run
        outside the spring season. Transmutations are indeed observed
        during germination in sunlight, at different periods in the
        year, but they are not quantitatively equivalent. </p>
      <p>It became clear then that artificial lighting would be
        beneficial, even in spring, in a room insufficiently exposed to
        daylight. It would also be useful for studies made at other
        periods of the year to extend the action of sunlight. It would
        enable the experimenter to have an artificial day of
        controllable length, so as to always operate under optimal
        conditions for photosynthesis in all locations and seasons. </p>
      <p><b>(a) Photosynthesis ~</b> </p>
      <p>We are not trying to summarize here what photosynthesis is. We
        are restricting this word to mean the action of solar rays on
        the chlorophyll metabolism. This does not encompass the whole of
        photobiology. We will not discuss more specific subdivisions
        such as phototropism, which manifests itself by an orientation
        of the pant toward light. As a point of interest for what
        follows, we will note that blue rays are most active for
        phototropism. Oat plants lit laterally with blue light bend
        toward light. As a point of interest for what follows, we will
        note that blue rays are most active for phototropism. Oat plants
        lit laterally with blue light bend toward the blue light source.
        There is an antagonistic effect with longer wavelengths. If the
        other side of the oat seedling is lit with a green or
        yellow-green light, the seedling grows vertically. We will not
        touch either on what is called photoperiodism, or the influence
        of alternating periods of light and darkness. We shall recall
        that the inverse reactions of photosynthesis are produced in
        darkness by the plant. Photosynthesis achieves the global effect
        of taking carbon dioxide from ambient air, fixing carbon in
        various organic compounds (carbohydrates) and ejecting the
        oxygen generated from the water generated from the water
        supplied to the plant. In darkness, the plant takes oxygen from
        ambient air and ejects carbon dioxide. This is respiration,
        which only becomes important in darkness, because there is no
        photosynthesis. Furthermore, we will not discriminate between
        the optical spectrum of photosynthesis and the sensitivity of
        chlorophyll to various wavelengths of the solar spectrum. The
        curves for these two phenomena are very close, but they do not
        coincide, because photosynthesis includes additional reactions
        beyond the metabolism of chlorophyll. </p>
      <p>It is essential to remember tat our eye and plants have much
        different sensitivities to various wavelengths of the solar
        spectrum. It is not sunlight, as we see it, which should be used
        as a criterion in looking for the artificial light source
        closest to sunlight. We must find out to which parts of the
        solar spectrum chlorophyll and the whole plant react best. A
        difficulty stems from the fact that our measuring instruments,
        luxmeters for example, are calibrated from the effects on our
        eye. Brilliance and lighting units are defined by optical
        effects. It is the eye which is the final standard of
        measurement. In fact, there are two completely different
        aspects. This appears obvious in Figure 12a where we have drawn
        the curves of maximum sensitivity to wavelengths for the eye,
        and for photosynthesis. </p>
      <p><b><a href="fig12.gif" ">FIGURE 12</a> ~ Lamp
          Spectra</b> </p>
      <p>Wavelength is expressed in nanometers (nm) or billionths of a
        meter. This is the unit most commonly used today, because it
        conforms to the metric system. It is the thousandth part of a
        micrometer (or a micron). The millimicron and the nanometer are
        equivalent, the second being more common in spectrometry. Some
        people use the angstrom unit, which does not belong to the
        metric system and which for this reason is being progressively
        abandoned. One anstrom is equal to 10 nanometers. People using
        microns will divide by 1000 the figures quoted here in nm. </p>
      <p>Visible light extends in principle from 400 to 700 nm. These
        are average limits. In fact, some people can see down in the
        violet as low as 380 nm; others see up in the red as high as 760
        nm (sometimes up to 800 nm). By convention, the near infrared
        (IR) encompasses the 750 (0r 800) to 1200 nm band. The far IR
        covers approximately the band up to 3000 nm. Beyond this
        wavelength the action of solar radiations is negligible and its
        effects on photosynthesis is not considered. The longer the
        wavelength, the lower the frequency associated with the wave.
        The photons with the most energy correspond to high frequencies,
        hence to sorter wavelengths; they are the photons in the blue,
        violet and ultraviolet (UV). Rays with wavelengths shorter than
        380-400 nm are rated as UV. </p>
      <p>The solar spectrum includes UV with a minimum wavelength of 390
        nm (or 288). Shorter wavelengths are stopped by the ozone layer
        surrounding the earth. Life on earth is only possible because of
        the filtering out of the rays of shorter wavelengths. In fact,
        shorter UVs are used for their bactericidal effects. They are
        life destroyers (the energy of their photons is such that they
        decompose living molecules). </p>
      <p>For photosynthesis one should not look for lamps with rays
        shorter than 290 nm. Even in photosynthesis no action is
        observed from rays with wavelengths shorter than 380 nm. In fact
        in nature, in the open country, there are rays between 290 nm
        and 380 nm. What is their purpose for the plants? They may act
        on pigments and on protovitamins, in animals as swell as in
        plants. There are few, quantitatively, and their energy seems to
        be weak. Their study is indeed difficult. In order to do this,
        one must find solid substances to make prisms transparent to
        these wavelengths and opaque to others. The molecules of
        monochromatic substances should not be ionized by the energy of
        the photons in this band. Such materials are delicate.
        Therefore, we do not know what nature does with the rays in the
        290-380 nm wave band, perhaps because their study presents too
        many difficulties. We are noting this, but we will not come back
        to it, because the present document is only related to the
        aspects of photosynthesis which we can understand with the help
        of today’s instrumentation. </p>
      <p>In fact, it seems that photosynthesis is altered by wavelengths
        shorter than 380 nm when they are of high intensity. This is the
        case of the 365.4 nm mercury ray. It penetrates through quartz,
        but it can be stopped by glasses of various compositions. For
        the purpose of photosynthesis, glass filtering UVs below 375 nm
        should be used in mercury discharge fluorescent lamps (or tubes)
        when fluorescence is produced by the internal coating. When the
        arc is produced between two electrodes in mercury vapor, the
        discharge tube must be made of quartz so it does not stop the
        UVs, which will trigger fluorescence in the special powders
        coating the inside of the light fixture’s external glass
        surface. The glass shields the plants from UV rays (below 375
        nm), but it does not stop fluxes in the 375-400 nm wave bands
        which are essential for some phases of photosynthesis. The
        intense 253.7 nm ray is completely stopped by the glass and it
        is used for the excitation of fluorescence. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, IR rays have weak energies. Their energy is
        essentially thermal. It is sufficient that the glass remains
        transparent to rays up to about 1000 nm. Glass is opaque to
        wavelengths in the far IR, which explains its use for the
        greenhouse effect. The near IR penetrates inside, and the ground
        reemits a heat of a longer wavelength which cannot get out. </p>
      <p>The radiation of red and IR rays up to 780 nm controls the
        opening of the stomata of the leaf, hence its respiration and
        its transpiration. Beyond this point, a counter effect is
        started. Leaf moisture loss ad gas loss should not become
        excessive. Beyond 780 nm, photon energy is low; this is why the
        curve of photosynthesis intensity remains close to the
        horizontal axis (see curves in Figures 12a and 12c). The thermal
        agitation due to red and longer wavelengths excites electrons in
        the atoms of the organic material of the leaf. However, the
        energy is too low to permit the extraction of the electrons
        which have moved to less stable orbits. Electrons do not move
        from atom to atom as they would under the stronger energetic
        effect of blue and shorter wavelengths. This constitutes the
        chemical effect of blue, violet and UV rays on the molecules
        prepared by the thermal effect of red rays. It can be seen from
        the curves in Figures 12a and 12c that the peak of energy is
        higher on the side of short wavelengths than it is on the side
        of long wavelengths. By contrast intermediary wavelengths in the
        green and yellow have no significant influence on
        photosynthesis. On the contrary, under artificial light in an
        apartment, for example. Our eye is most sensitive to yellow.
        Consequently, lamps designed for industrial or domestic lighting
        should not be used in phyto-optics. We note this point, which is
        sometimes forgotten. </p>
      <p><b>(b) Characteristics of Some Lamps ~</b> </p>
      <p>We will not list the tens of lamp types used for artificial
        lighting in agriculture, horticulture, etc. They are described
        in many published works. We used a wide selection of lamps,
        incandescent, discharge, fluorescent and mixed, because not all
        plants are sensitive to the same wavelengths. This fact is well
        known and it is used in the design of commercial products. Most
        often it is known only empirically and the related information
        is marred by many errors. We evidenced this during experiments
        on the transmutations observed on particular elements during the
        germination and the growth of cereal plants. </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the 60’s some agronomists recommended lamps
        of the warm white type or sometimes warm white deluxe. I believe
        this is a mistake. Figure 12b shows a diagram of the
        characteristic emissivity for these lamps. The rectangles show
        the primary characteristic rays of excitation of the
        fluorescence. The continuous curves characterize the spectrum
        outside the lamp. It is obvious that these lamps are very
        deficient in the blue-violet and too strong in the hot colors,
        the reds. We saw that red has an effect on the control of
        transcription, hence on gas exchanges. Transpiration depends on
        the energy in the blue for about 40% and on the energy in the
        red for 60%. However, plant growth and development and the
        chemical reactions which cause the synthesis of the organic
        compounds constituting the plant, are only active in the
        blue-violet and the UV. Growth hormones (auxins, etc.) are also
        synthesized under their action. We are not surprised that
        phytobiologists, under their action. We were not surprised that
        phytobiologists, after following erroneous procedures of 15
        years ago, got underdeveloped seedlings. Their plants grew only
        a few centimeters after several weeks as seedlings of 25-30 cm
        height are obtained under optimum lighting in the same time span
        for wheat as well as for oat. I have no base of comparison for
        other grains. Without blue rays, wheat assimilates nitrogen and
        potassium with difficulty. Contrary to what happens under normal
        cultivation, the plant cannot assimilate K correctly, therefore
        no transmutation of K into Ca can take place. The circulation of
        water and mineral salts inside the plant is normally made
        because of the long wavelengths. It is only a transfer, which
        does not involve any physical or chemical transformations. These
        are only triggered by wavelengths in the blue through UV band. </p>
      <p>The color temperature of the warm white lamp is of 3,500 K (or
        color 29 on the Phillips scale, as compared to 34 for the Warm
        White Deluxe. This figure of 34 corresponds to a radiated power
        of 7.1 watts, as the lamp of color 29, which radiates in the
        red, has a peak of 8.1 W. </p>
      <p>The radiant flux is greatest for the Daylight Lamp, but its
        flux in the red is too low. Its flux in the blue is
        significantly higher. It is felt that it gives objects a bluish
        cast. This is why these lamps were replaced with lamps which
        gave a warmer light (more red, less blue). These lamps have a
        radiating energy in the blue which is significantly too low for
        photosynthesis. They are lamps for home lighting. We will note
        that these lamps strongly radiate in the intermediary spectrum,
        which is adapted to our sensitivity and appropriate for interior
        lighting. However, it is a waste for photosynthesis. </p>
      <p><b>(c) A Well Designed Lamp ~</b> </p>
      <p>One can change the shape of the fluorescence curve by changing
        the nature of the powder coating the inside of the discharge
        lamps. This can also be done by changing the nature of the rays
        triggering fluorescence in the compound coating the inside wall
        of the quartz discharge tube. </p>
      <p>Iridium radiates in the 411-450 nm band, hence in the blue.
        There is even a very weak ray of 380 nm in the UV. There are
        also two important rays around 680 and 690 nm. Two other
        elements are also used to trigger fluorescence: thallium which
        radiates at 534 nm and sodium at 588 nm. However, their
        intensity in the yellow must be corrected with too many blue and
        red wavelengths to be practical. These lamps are now of little
        use. Magnesium arseniate, fluorogermanate and manganese
        compounds were also used for the fluorescent coating. Iodine
        gives an intense ray at 577 nm, at the limit of the yellow and
        green. Because of this, it is used in large lamp fixtures for
        public lighting and automobile headlights. However, iodine has
        other useful properties. It also gives a ray in the UV and it is
        added in some fluorescent lamps as such, or as metallic iodides.
        Unfortunately, almost all the known spectra are not appropriate
        for phyto-cultivation, at least in studies on elementary
        transmutations. These transmutations cannot happen with spectra
        of the types represented in Figure 12b. I shall not comment on
        the Osram Power Star lamp used by Zundel, as I had no experience
        with it. </p>
      <p>In Figure 12c, I am showing the spectrum of a lamp specially
        designed by Societe des Lampes Claude in France. For over 15
        years lamps of the types in 12b proved inadequate. Societe
        Claude markets lamps rated to 250 W and to 400 W. I was
        gratified that they lent me units of the 250 W model giving
        12,000 lumens. Let’s not forget the relativity of the light flux
        concept for the eye. A close correlation between lamp and
        photosynthesis spectra is the only consideration which counts.
        In this oblong lamp, electrical discharges are produced in Hg at
        low pressure between electrodes inside a quartz tube. The tube
        is closed and it can be mounted in a horizontal position. It is
        surrounded by a surface made of special glass and internally
        coated with a fluorescent salt. Various compounds were tested
        such as a ytrrium vanadiate doped with europium; other more
        common compounds, such as phosphates, aluminates, etc., could be
        used. </p>
      <p>Rays radiated by the discharge tube, such as the 253.7 nm Hg
        ray, trigger the fluorescence in the coating. Due to the
        filtering effect of the glass, the 404.7nm and other rays of
        longer wavelengths are the only ones radiating outside the lamp.
        The spectrum distribution is shown in Figure 12c. It is seen
        that two Hg rays are located toward the end of green and in the
        yellow. They have little positive effect on photosynthesis and
        no negative effects in general. Their effect is to give a light
        which is relatively white to the human eye, a useful point in
        greenhouses. There, flower and leaf colors should look the same
        as under solar light, so that the general state of health of the
        plants may be gauged in one glance. </p>
      <p>The Phytoclaude 400 W model lamp, which was lent to us, gave
        the following radiated flux in watts for various bands: </p>
      <p>Wavelengths in nm: 400-450 ~ 450-600 ~ 600-700 ~ Total: 400-700
        <br>
        Flux in watts: 10.2 ~ 2.29 ~ 0.92 ~ Total: 13.93 </p>
      <p>One clearly sees the considerable advantage presented by this
        lamp: approximately 10/13 of the energy transformed in light is
        in the 400-450 nm band, which is the active part of the spectrum
        for photosynthesis. The Warm White Deluxe lamp radiates only
        1.7/13.4 of its energy in the 400-510 nm band. In fact, the 520
        nm wavelength is already in the green, hence has little effect
        on the photosynthesis. The total radiated energy is not a
        sufficient criterion; the important point is the band
        distribution. Even if the band is extended to 510 nm, the Warm
        White Deluxe lamp gives 6 times less energy than the Phytoclaude
        lamp gives in the blue-violet with similar total radiated
        energies (13.4 W vs 13.7 for the Phytoclaude lamp). </p>
      <p><b>(d) Cultivation in a Closed Chamber with Carbon Dioxide ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Commercial cultivation of flowers and some vegetables under
        phyto-lighting is usually done in large greenhouses. Laboratory
        studies are often made in small rooms and even in small cabinets
        designed for this purpose. Sometimes they are made in the corner
        of a laboratory under a plastic shelter which lets light in but
        stops dust. In all cases the plants are placed in an atmosphere
        renewed naturally or by mechanical means. </p>
      <p>For more precise studies, one can use closed chambers
        maintained at a slightly positive pressure (3 mm W.G. for
        example) by a filtered air supply. Chambers normally include a
        removable panel to allow the handling of the equipment and
        seedlings. Panels are fixed in place by gaskets and screws. They
        are sometimes made of polymethylmetacrylate (plexiglass, for
        example) transparent to the right bands of the solar spectrum.
        These chambers can be exposed to solar light or to phyto-lamps.
        Even better results are achieved with Altuglas. </p>
      <p>When extra precautions to prevent any external contamination
        are deemed necessary, seedling trays are supplied with air by an
        electric centrifugal lamp delivering a positive pressure. The
        air passes through a filter which retains practically all the
        dust, as we verified. Sometimes even more stringent precautions
        may seem necessary. Let’s take the case of the study calcium
        variations during the germination of grains. One must operate
        with water and air absolutely devoid of Ca variations during the
        germination of grains. One must operate with water and air
        absolutely devoid of calcium to obtain an accurate Ca balance
        before and after germination. Sometimes the Ca was measured by
        neutron activation techniques in the seeds. Unfortunately, seeds
        exposed to non-lethal doses of neutron radiations were sometimes
        irradiated for the experiments. This was a mistake. Seedlings
        are watered with twice distilled water, free of measurable Ca.
        After several weeks the plants are analyzed by various methods.
        To prevent any dust from entering the plant chamber the supply
        air is bubbled through a flask partially filled with an acid
        solution (30 ml HCl to 750 ml of twice distilled water in
        one-liter flask). The air is then pushed into the hydroponic
        cultivation chamber. Any lime particulate in suspension is
        dissolved in the acid solution. With the positive pressure, no
        external air leakage into the chamber can occur, even if a
        gasket is defective. Any leakage would be detected with the
        water gauge at the air intake. </p>
      <p>With these precautions, numerous studies on oats showed that
        there was a production of calcium by the seedlings during their
        growth. </p>
      <p>Additional precautions were taken for studies on oat and wheat
        in particular concerning the purification of the air supply.
        Behind the flask with the acid solution were added two flasks
        containing a NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution and one flask containing
        twice distilled water for a final scrubbing. The role of the
        basic solution was to neutralize any acid carry-over without
        trapping the CO2 contained in the air supply. These represent
        the most elaborate precautions which can be imagined. This was
        necessary in order to counter prejudiced objections, which
        ascribe all increases in calcium to an external source. Even
        with such a wealth of precautions, there is an increase in Ca
        which can exceed 100% of the total Ca contained in the seeds
        germinated. </p>
      <p>Tested were made on wheat in a controlled atmosphere with a CO<sub>2</sub>
        concentration of 0.08% and a lighting 4,000 lux. With 10,000 lux
        it was possible to raise the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> up
        to 0.013%. Under intense sunlight it is possible to reach
        70,000-80,000 lux, but the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration cannot
        be increased in the same proportion. There is a saturation
        phenomenon in the plant for various reasons. Principally because
        other functions must follow: water and mineral salt circulation,
        gas exchanges, etc. For wheat, the optimum concentration seems
        to be 0.5-0.6% or approximately 15 times as much as in ambient
        air, and it produces an assimilation about ten times higher than
        normal in the atmosphere. We shall remember that the lux
        measurement is of little value as it refers to the human eye.
        Studies were made up to 20,000-30,000 lux and even more, but
        this is not economically feasible. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, good results were obtained on wheat in a
        controlled atmosphere including 0.14% CO2, which is four times
        the natural concentration. These results were obtained in a
        glass chamber in sunlight without additional phytolighting. More
        straw, heads and grain were obtained and the heads were larger.
        This shows that the development of grains is limited by the
        relative scarcity of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. In a
        controlled atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 4 times
        greater than in ambient air can be used. We shall note that most
        published data related to this subject are wrong because they
        are based on Calvin’s cycle. We shall comeback to this point. </p>
      <p>One barley species shows great resilience to intense
        irradiation by a light source of 460 nm. In this band, 10,000
        kiloergs/cm<sup>2</sup> are required to stop flower formation.
        By contrast, it takes only a much smaller amount of energy
        (about 1,000 kiloergs/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 480 nm to stop the
        formation of soybean flowers. Consequently, in the open, barley
        blooms during long days and soybean plants bloom during shorter
        days, when the intensity of the sun has subsided. Usable
        energies in the read are always low. Barley needs only 300
        kiloergs/cm<sup>2</sup> at 700 nm. The figure is the same for
        soybeans. Barley and soybeans show similar effects to green
        light. Grains use 10 times as much energy in the blue as the
        legumes. This must be taken into account when using artificial
        light. There is no general rule; each plant species should be
        studied separately. </p>
      <p><b>(e) A Few Additional Comments on Photosynthesis ~</b> </p>
      <p>I will deal here with a subject which, to my knowledge, has not
        been presented in any published work. Our knowledge of the
        photosynthesis phenomena is incomplete and agricultural
        engineers should hold reservations regarding some so-called
        authoritative statements. We observe some results, but we cannot
        explain the complete sequence of reactions which lead to them. </p>
      <p>The most common mechanism for explaining photosynthesis is the
        Calvin cycle. This cycle was adopted with much enthusiasm and
        too little discernment, because there was no acceptable
        explanation previously. Calvin started from existing
        intermediary organic compounds, which were already isolated.
        Everything Calvin surmised from there on seemed to link up
        logically. However, he neglected energy balances. Many
        experiments with similar results seemed to show that 8 photons
        were required for each CO<sub>2</sub> molecule in the air in
        order that the plant could synthesize organic compounds. But
        what plant? Conclusions true for a particular plant were
        incorrectly extrapolated to other plants. For these, the Calvin
        cycle required a much higher number of photons. Consequently
        this cycle, adopted with enthusiasm by a majority of the people,
        was the subject of justified objections. The cycle was modified
        several times and Calvin’s name is now followed by the names of
        the main researchers who added to it. </p>
      <p>Despite all these additions, some organic molecules formed by
        photosynthesis in certain plants could not be explained by the
        Calvin cycle. Following a very human and common tendency,
        studies of photosynthesis had been conducted mainly on a single
        plant, spinach, which supplies green material in large
        quantities and almost all the time. It was a fashionable plant.
        The results were extrapolated to every plant. There was one
        photosynthesis mechanism. It was concluded that chlorophyll (a
        and b in particular) was the same everywhere, and consequently
        that chemical reactions had to be identical in every case. </p>
      <p>Experience contradicted this simplification. It was observed
        that the Calvin cycle broadly applied to almost all
        dicotyledons, but that it did not apply at all to plants as
        common as graminaceae, such as corn, sorghum and sugar cane, all
        of which are monocotyledons. These plants fix the CO<sub>2</sub>
        of the air at a much higher rate. They need less organic
        fcrtilizer and they need less humus, because their carbonaceous
        components are derived out of the air in larger proportion. This
        is also the case for weeds. </p>
      <p>In the Calvin cycle, the CO<sub>2</sub> from the air attaches
        to ribulose 1-5 diphosphate molecules. Each resulting molecule
        decomposes into two 3-phosphoglyceric acid molecules. On the
        other hand, in the Hatch and Slack cycle, the CO<sub>2</sub> is
        fixed by carboxylation of the phosphophenolpyruvate with
        formation of oxaloacetic acid. This acid reacts with C<sub>2</sub>
        or C<sub>5</sub> molecules to form pyruvic and phosphoglyceric
        acides. </p>
      <p>This big difference between the two cycles can be presented in
        another way. In th Calvin cycle, the compounds formed from the
        CO<sub>2</sub> in the air are primarily compounds with 3 atoms
        of carbon, such as glycerol-3-hosphate. In the Hatch and Slack
        cycle, C<sub>4</sub> compounds are synthesized, such as
        oxaloacetate. </p>
      <p>In other words, dicotyledons fix 3 carbon atoms and
        monocotyledons 4 carbon atoms. This explains the better yield
        for the latter. Synthesized enzymes are also different. There is
        more in the Hatch and Slack cycle than in the Calvin cycle. Some
        dicotyledons growing on salty lands follow the Hatch and Slack
        cycle. This would be due to a still unknown property of Na,
        tentatively attributed by some people to a transmutation of Na.
        These plants can be used to desalt a soil. </p>
      <p>The Calvin cycle is the cycle in C<sub>3</sub> and the Hatch
        and Slack cycle is the cycle in C<sub>4</sub>. Consequently, the
        latte produces more carbohydrates and more dry material. It
        requires only half as much water and more dry material. It
        requires only half as much water. This is the reason why these
        plants can grow well in fairly dry climates, as is the case with
        corn, sorghum, etc. </p>
      <p>There is another important difference. In the C<sub>3</sub>
        cycle, 40-50% of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> initially fixed
        is returned to the atmosphere by photorespiration. This could
        explain why in a closed chamber the atmosphere can still contain
        some CO<sub>2</sub>, although the incoming air has previously
        bubble through a solution of caustic soda to fix any incoming CO<sub>2</sub>.
        The remaining CO<sub>2</sub> decreases slowly and
        asymptotically. The plant wilts and dies slowly. On the other
        hand, in the C4 cycle very little carbon is returned to the
        atmosphere. Almost all the carbon which is fixed is retained.
        Carbohydrates are formed more quickly. Grain plants, such as
        cereal plants, lack CO<sub>2</sub> much sooner than most other
        monocotyledons when they are grown in a closed atmosphere, fed
        through a caustic acid solution. Their chlorophyll deficiency
        can be soon observed. At least, this is my interpretation. </p>
      <p><b>(f) Isotopes ~</b> </p>
      <p>One should also observe in passing another phenomenon.
        Monocotyledons and dicotyledons are not only the seat of
        different chemical reactions, but they also have different
        physical behaviors. They fix stable carbon, oxygen and hydrogen
        isotopes differently when they come from CO<sub>2</sub> and from
        water. In the sugar beet (a dicotyledon), saccharose does not
        have the same isotopic composition as the saccharose in sugar
        cane (a monocot). This question was studied recently with the
        greatest care. Its implication is not only scientific, but also
        economic. The selling price in sugar cane is much higher than
        the selling price in beet sugar. Fraud is possible. For the
        chemists in charge of the analyses, saccharose is saccharose;
        its formula is the same. It is impossible to determine its
        origin after it has been purified. But Nature does not dabble
        only in chemistry, it also dabbles in physics. C<sup>13</sup>/C<sup>12</sup>,
        O<sup>18</sup>/O<sup>16</sup>, H<sup>2</sup>/H<sup>1</sup> ratio
        variations are high enough to be detected with mass
        spectrometry. Customs and the Agency for the Repression of Fraud
        are now equipped to check sugar to determine its area of origin.
        They use the same techniques with other compounds and other
        plants. </p>
      <p>The treaties I know on photosynthesis are all silent on this
        point. Many other points are still unknown. Understanding of
        detailed reactions in chlorophyll still escape us. We only know
        some intermediary steps, and the molecular structures resulting
        from the combined action of photomorphogenesis and
        photosynthesis. We still do not know what happens inside the
        chlorophyll molecule at the atomic level. This molecule includes
        approximately 150 atoms grouped around a nucleus or heart of
        porphyrin. This porphyrin is formed around a magnesium atom
        linked to 4 nitrogen atoms. What happens at this level? Though
        magnesium is at chlorophyll’s core, it is never included in the
        formulas proposed by agronomists. Furthermore, it is assumed
        that chlorophyll preexists, but one does not known how Nature
        reproduces it. As the pant develops, the number of leaves
        increases, leaves grow and chlorophyll forms. Magnesium is a
        transition metal element, Does it act only as an electron
        carrier as iron in hemoglobin, copper in the hemocyanin of the
        shellfish, vanadium in ascidiae, etc.? There again we do not
        know the internal process generated by this central atom; we do
        not even know the process generated by porphyrin, which is built
        around this atom. </p>
      <p><b>(g) Conclusions ~</b> </p>
      <p>Photosynthesis cannot be totally explained by chemical, hence
        molecular, phenomena, which have not been completely explored.
        There are indeed phenomena at the atomic level, such as
        variations in isotopic composition. However, we should consider
        the possibility of subatomic phenomena. These may be direct or
        indirect mechanism. I am inclined to say indirect and they work
        through the unquestionable and selective action of specific
        enzymes, growth hormones and other hormones. These compounds may
        contribute to the transmutations which were clearly shown in the
        course of the experiments. Nothing is simple. Results obtained
        with one plant cannot be extrapolated and applied to all plants.
        Failure will result if this point is not kept in mind. Each
        experiment should be performed according to a well defined
        procedure. In this field innovation may lead to poor results.
        Even a simple question of lighting, of inappropriate spectrum,
        may make the difference between positive and negative results.
        This is essentially the point I am trying to make. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Photosynthesis (Limited to Traditional Aspects) ~</b> </p>
      <p>In most treatises the study of photosynthesis is based on the
        research based on spinach. This produces unwarranted
        generalizations. </p>
      <p>In one kilogram of spinach leaves there are approximately 500
        million chloroplasts. 60% of the weight of the proteins
        contained in the leaves are located in these small organs which
        are concentrated in the cytoplasm of the leaves. </p>
      <p>These chloroplasts are 7-8 micrometer long and 2-3 micrometers
        thick. They are filled with a lumpy liquid, the stroma, which is
        surrounded by a double envelope. One of these constitutes a
        membrane network, the thylakoids. Thylakoids are vesicles filled
        with a liquid composed 80% of glycolipids and sulfolipids. Their
        envelopes contain very little phospholipids, but they contain
        chlorophylls (150 micrograms of proteins and 30 micrograms of
        pigments such as carotenoids). Nearly 50% of the proteins
        contained in the chloroplast are located in the thylakoid
        envelopes. Cytochromes and plastocyanin were found in them; they
        are proteins which can give or receive electrons according to
        their environoment. The nature of the constituents inside the
        thylakoids seems to be totally unknown as of 1980. </p>
      <p>The stroma is rich in soluble proteins (about 0.4 gr/ml of
        stroma). It contains about 50% of the proteins in the
        chloroplast. The stroma contains the DNA and RNA which
        synthesize&nbsp; some proteins in the chloroplast. The lumpy
        aspect of the stroma, revealed by the electron microscope, is
        mainly attributed to ribosomes. The surface area for the
        external chloroplast envelope amounts to about 500 cm<sup>2</sup>
        for one gram of leaf. The envelope contains only 1-2% of the
        proteins in the chloroplast. To this day, none of these proteins
        have been isolated it seems. Chloroplasts transform ADP in ATP
        under the effect of light and in the presence of electron
        acceptors. </p>
      <p>The knowledge of photosynthesis progressed after intact
        chloroplasts were obtained in 1965. They simultaneously give
        some oxygen and fixed CO<sub>2</sub> in a 1/1 ratio in the
        presence of light. However, chloroplast separation techniques
        were only applied to a very few vegetal species. Experiments
        were primarily performed with spinach. Test preparation was
        perfected for this plant. Its green material can be harvest all
        year round. Consequently, it was the subject of 70% of the
        research. This led many researchers to extrapolate their results
        to other species. This is a mistake. It was observed in some
        green plants, such as corn and sugar cane, that some
        intermediary steps were different from the steps in spinach
        reactions. This showed that the photosynthesis for spinach, a
        dicotyledon, did not apply to these monocotyledons. </p>
      <p>When thylakoids are exposed are exposed to light, electrons are
        transferred between water and a final acceptor, of still unknown
        structure, designated as X protein. Walter Redox potential for
        the final acceptor, E’<sub>o</sub> = 0.1 V. Therefore, it is
        necessary to bring energy in, to operate the transfer. The
        energy is brought by light photons. This energy transfer is
        coupled with an ADP phosphorylation into ATP; this constitutes
        the energy storage mechanism. Light energy is collected inside
        the thylakoid membrane by two antennas each belonging to a
        different photosystem. These antennas comprise a system of
        proteins and pigments (chlorphylls and carotenoids) which absorb
        light energy and transmit it, by resonance, to the a-chlorophyll
        which is different in each photosystem. His chlorophyll is
        oxidized. One of its electrons is transferred to an acceptor.
        The transfer creates a high potential gradient, 0.8 V for one
        photosystem and 1 V for the other. For the first one, water is
        the electron donor, but to this day the acceptor is unknown. It
        is designated as the protein. </p>
      <p>A magnesium base proteins intervenes during this reaction.
        Water is oxidized, giving protons and molecular oxygen
        (schematically: H<sub>2</sub>O + O = H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>).





        The detailed mechanism of this reaction is still the subject of
        current studies. It is now generally accepted that oxygen is
        dissociated from water and not from CO<sub>2</sub>, as it was
        initially believed. In the other photosystems, the electron
        acceptor (X) is a protein which includes iron and sulfur atoms.
        Fe and S have a very low Redox potential. The two systems are
        connected by a chain of carriers which is little understood. </p>
      <p>Q molecule electrons are successively transferred to quinines,
        to various cytochromns and then finally to plastocyanin, in
        which the electron donor is a blue protein containing copper. </p>
      <p>Electrons are transferred from X proteins to ferroxoxin, which
        is a very small protein (molecular weight of the order of
        12,000) of a low Redox potential. E’<sub>o</sub> = 0.32 C,
        containing Fe and S). Ferrodoxin contains iron and sulfur.
        Ferroxin can transfer its electrons to various molecules such as
        nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate, NADP. It can also
        transfer them to a nitrite based flavoprotein. This transfer
        produces NH ions and electrons can be transferred to oxygen with
        production of superoxide radicals. </p>
      <p>In this case the overall balance may be summarized by the
        following relation: </p>
      <p>H<sub>2</sub>O + NADP &gt;&gt; NADPH<sub>2</sub> + ½ O<sub>2</sub>
      </p>
      <p>The NADP is reduced and the oxygen probably comes from the
        water. The primary effect of this transfer of electrons is the
        production of the highly reducing NADPH<sub>2</sub> molecule;
        oxygen is only a by-product, so to speak. </p>
      <p>We shall note that magnesium, the central atom of the
        chloroplast molecule, does not appear in these formulae. Its
        function has not yet been established. Many unknowns remain.
        Isn’t such research purely speculative? Many teams of
        researchers throughout the world are attempting a direct
        transfer of electrons to a final acceptor by the channel of
        ferrodoxin coupled to hydrogenase. Hydrogenase is an enzyme
        extracted from bacteria or from molecular algae, through
        reactions producing molecular hydrogen. Hydrogen is a
        non-polluting source of energy. In nature, the
        ferrodoxin-hydrogenase pairing is observed among many bacteria
        produce a reaction similar to the above except that they don’t
        free any oxygen. The thalla which live in symbiosis in the blue
        algae, does produce oxygen. </p>
      <p>The production of hydrogen results in a pH modification on both
        sides of the thylakoid membrane. Plastoquinones, carriers of
        both protons and electrons, are reduced by Q molecules on the
        external face of the thylakoids and they capture protons from
        the stroma. However, the plastoquinones, oxidized by the
        cytochrome near the thylakoids internal envelope, also discharge
        some protons in the stroma. The protons formed during the
        oxidation of water contribute also to reinforce the pH gradient
        in the presence of light. Balance is due to the phosphorylation
        of ADP into ATP based on the formula proposed by the Englishman
        Mitchell: </p>
      <p>ADP<sub>3-</sub> + H+ = HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>- &gt;&gt;
        ATP<sub>4-</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O </p>
      <p>The detailed process of this schematic reaction is unknown. </p>
      <p>ADP and NADPH<sub>2</sub> molecules bring the necessary energy
        and the electrons to the stroma to fix the carbon dioxide from
        the air and to synthesize carbohydrates. 37 ATP molecules and 24
        NADPH<sub>2</sub> molecules are required for the synthesis of
        one saccharose molecule from H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>.
        In plant species of a type similar to spinach, the stroma inside
        the chloroplasts produces C3 molecules primarily (phosphorylated
        C<sub>5</sub>-oses: glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate or its isomer,
        dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate). This is a complex process realized
        in three steps. A C<sub>5</sub> sugar is first decomposes in two
        3-phosphateglyceride acid molecules. It is during this step that
        the CO<sub>2</sub> from the air is integrated into organic
        molecules. One CO<sub>2</sub> molecule and one H<sub>2</sub>O
        molecule are consumed. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme
        of large molecular weight (500,000). It is a complex enzyme
        composed of 8 large units and 3 small subunits. The second step
        is subdivided into two sub-steps and the third step corresponds
        to regeneration. This series of steps is known as the Calvin
        cycle or now, as the BBC for Benson, Bassham and Calvin. </p>
      <p>Phosphorylated oses are produced in C<sub>6</sub> (fructose),
        in C<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, and finally in C<sub>5</sub>
        (ribulose). In 1973 Held showed that the pH of the stroma
        increased in the presence of light. The stroma loses protons to
        the inside space of the thyladoids until a balance is reached.
        In darkness it is the opposite. Enzyme activity is controlled by
        these pH variations. </p>
      <p>Beet sugar and spinach leaves behave similarly. Both plants are
        dicots. Each square meter of beet leaves feeds about 130 mg/min
        of glucids in the veins of the leaves&nbsp; from which the
        glucids move to the roots for storage. The mechanism controlling
        the subsequent transformations of the 3-phosphates
        glyceraldehydes, after they reach the cytoplasm, is not known.
        Those which are not sent to the cytoplasm and those in the
        stroma, are transformed into starch which is a high saccharose
        polymer. </p>
      <p>Contrary to saccharose, starch is not phosphorylated. There is
        a biological limit to the yield of the photosynthesis process.
        During the respiration phase, plants controlled by the BBC cycle
        waste a large part of the carbon integrated during the
        photosynthesis phase. It is estimated that these plants use only
        1% of the 5.10<sup>20</sup> kilocalories received each year from
        the sun. This consideration underlines the economic importance
        of the next cycle. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Photosynthesis Cycle of Hatch and Slack ~</b> </p>
      <p>The photosynthesis cycle of Calvin is well known. It is the
        classic cycle in all published works, because it was most widely
        studied. In fact, a study of the C<sup>13</sup>/C<sup>12</sup>
        isotopic ratio (research of 1968 by Bender) showed that it could
        vary by 5-15% and even more according to the photosynthesis
        cycle of the vegetal species. The study showed that this result
        was independent of the composition of the living medium for the
        culture and that it did not vary with time. The variations in
        the ratio could only be attributed to the physiology of the
        plant under the control of its specific enzymes. The emphasis
        was placed on the ratio between the two stable carbon isotopes
        in corn, as the chlorophyll metabolism seems to fix
        proportionally less C<sup>13</sup> from the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Research on photosynthesis was first made with dicots because
        there was a convenient source of supply of raw material. The
        research extended to monocots such as corn. Sugar cane was
        included in order to stop fraud in sugar. Cane sugar contains
        more C<sup>13</sup> than beet sugar. As previously mentioned,
        the Calvin cycle combines the CO<sub>2</sub> from the air with
        ribose-1.5-diphosphate in beet sugar. The resulting molecule
        decomposes into two 3-phosphoglyceric acid molecules. As early
        as 1966, Hatch and Slack discovered another cycle in monocots.
        In that cycle, they showed that the CO<sub>2</sub> from the air
        was fixed by carboxylation of the phosphenol-pyruvate and formed
        oxaloacetic acid. This acid combines with C2 or C5 molecules to
        form pyruvic and phosphoglyceric acids. In France, J. Bricout
        and others observed that the C<sup>13</sup>/C<sup>12</sup>
        isotopic ratios were significantly different for beet and cane
        sugars. The decrease in C<sup>13</sup> is of the order of 1.1%,
        compared to its concentration in the CO<sub>2</sub> control, for
        cane sugar. The decrease is 2.5% for beet sugar. </p>
      <p>We see the advantages of cultivating monocots rather than
        dicots. They derive more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
        require less organic feed. Many weeds have the same property and
        they grow even without fertilizer. </p>

      <p>When I published my first works I had problems with chemists
        for whom theory precedes facts. For them, nothing is lost and
        nothing is created. This is true in chemistry. To many
        biochemists, life is only chemistry, and chemistry is the
        supreme science which explains everything, even the most
        abstract: will power, feelings, etc. </p>
      <p>With a wealth of experiments I showed that chemical balances
        between elements in and elements and elements out were not
        always null. I was astounded by the naivete and the lack of
        realism of these biochemists. Their final argument was that a
        balance which was not null could not only be attributed to
        incomplete analyses. They claimed that some elements were surely
        hidden in a form which could not be detected by the analyses as
        performed. They did not realize that they only confessed their
        incapacity to perform correct chemical analyses. Chemists, even
        those who boast of being professors in our universities, could
        not be trusted. </p>
      <p>Confronted with such common attributes, I just shrugged my
        shoulders. To avoid useless polemics, I decided to stop
        referring to chemical analyses and to use modern techniques of
        physical analysis such as flame spectroscopy for J, atomic
        absorption spectroscopy for Ca, etc. At the beginning of my
        research, physical techniques to quantitatively measure specific
        anions, such as S, P and N, had not been developed. The same is
        still true 20 years late. His is why my studies, and those of
        researchers who wanted to duplicate them, were limited to the
        study of balances for a few important cations by various
        physical techniques. </p>
      <p>In France a university professor, who was a high-ranking
        Rationalist wrote in a publication that I was wrong. He was
        director of the biological chemistry laboratory in his
        university. Rationalism was a philosophy publicized by
        Robespierre, pope of the Goddess Reason. This professor had
        decided to duplicate, as he said, one of my experiments. In fact
        his experiment differed extensively from mine. A summary of his
        study was included on pages 88-91 of my book, now out of print,
        <i>Preuves Relatives a l’Existence de Transmutations Biologiques</i>,
        published by Maloine in 1968. The essential argument was
        reproduced on pages 212-213 in my book of 1975, <i>Preuves en
          Biologie de Transmutations de Faible Energie</i>, which is
        still being reprinted. I will not say more on the obvious bad
        faith and the exaggerated cynicism of some sectarian objectors.
        Far be it from me to place all Rationalists under one label.
        There are exceptions among them as there are exceptions
        everywhere. I learned that several distinguished scientists
        among them protested against the attitude of this learned
        master. </p>
      <p>However, he was not the only one to think in this way. I
        mentioned the case of the hidden iodine produced by some algae,
        which cannot be measured in a certain vegetal state, but can be
        measured in another state. This showed indeed that some
        experiments were deficient. To point at the errors was not
        sufficient. To disdainfully reject gratuitous affirmations was
        not the solution to definitively eradicate affirmations was not
        the solution to credulous and unscientific minds of too many
        biochemists. Figures were necessary. In the book mentioned
        before, dating from 1968, on p. 158-167, I had indeed given some
        precise information. However, it concerned phosphorus variations
        during the germination of lentils. Undoubtedly this escaped
        various phytobiologists. I noted in a publication, Revue de
        Biologie, that a professor of botany was still imbued with 19th
        century dogma in 1980. Criticizing the data presented by Zundel
        on the increase in Ca during the germination of oats, she
        writes, "If the ashes are dissolved in hot HCl, the acid cannot
        dissolve Ca which is in the form of sulfates and phosphates. An
        underestimation of the total quantity of Ca in the caryopses
        could result, whereas the Ca contained in the seedlings, and
        which can be oxidized, would be counted in its totality. This
        could explain the increase in Ca which was noted". General
        statements are made without regard for the precise experimental
        data, which are not even mentioned. In the previous paragraph,
        she wrote: "In caryopses, Ca is partially found in phytins
        (inositol hexaphosphate of Ca and Mg) in aleurone granules, and
        partially as insoluble phosphate and sulfate. In seedlings, Ca
        is found mainly as pectate, which is transformed in oxide by
        combustion". </p>
      <p>But what are these pectates? "Combustions"? Arguments, but no
        figures! The "partially" is meaningless. Which part? Which
        proportion? I will quote figures later. So much for the
        questionable, and even partially wrong. Opinion expressed by
        this university professor. Before presenting my figures, I
        believe I should say a few words presenting my figures, I
        believe I should say a few words about phosphorus which is not
        part of this work. </p>

      <p>Phosphorus and calcium in living matter are closely related.
        They have&nbsp; been studied for a long time. I dedicated a
        chapter of my 1975 book to Vauquelin’s studies on the balance of
        the calcium ingested by a hen. Calcium is found as carbohydrates
        and sulfates in oats, in the egg laid, and in droppings.
        Vauquelin mentioned chemical analysis procedures to measure the
        Ca linked to P and to the carbonate. This is not a new problem.
      </p>
      <p>In my book of 1968 I presented some detailed information on the
        studies related to form changes of P during seed germination. It
        came from a doctoral thesis written in 1935 by a pharmacist,
        Yves Colin, after a five-year study. I own a printed copy of
        this document in which 84 pages are dedicated to "Technical
        Research on the Separation and the measurement of Primary
        Phosphorus Elements in Seeds". Colin presented some data on
        wheat and on sunflowers, but his research was primarily on
        lentils. P and Ca contents are the same in lentils and in oats.
        However, there are marked differences in the nature of P
        compounds in different vegetal species, so that the analytical
        procedure varies from species to species. I did not include in
        my 1975 book the chapter which dealt with this matter in my book
        of 1978 which is now out of print. One can refer to Y. Colin’s
        thesis in university libraries. It will show precisely how wrong
        and biased were the statements expressed by the professor of
        botany mentioned previously, statements unsupported by
        quantified data. </p>
      <p>Good chemists know that P compounds are not soluble in any old
        solvent. Solvents must be selected. Care must be brought to the
        sequence of the reactions. A reaction can stop the sequence by
        fixing P in a compound which is then totally insoluble in the
        following reaction and it will then resist all attempts to
        measure it. </p>
      <p>In plants, P is found in phosphoric ester such as true
        phosphoro-lipids. Among the photo-lipids are found lecithins,
        but mostly they are glycerol-phosphoric acid derivatives. One
        also finds P in phosphoric acid esters of sugars, diphosphoric
        hexose monophosphoric ester, momophosphoric polyoses, etc.
        During the last decade of the 19th century and the beginning of
        the 20th century many studies dealt with P compounds and their
        quantitative variations in germinating pants. Phospo-lipids and
        phospho-amino-lipids were studied first, then the nucleic acids
        which incorporate large quantities of organic P were studied.
        After hydrolysis, they release o-phosphoric acid. Nucleic acids
        differ according to the plant; some information on this subject
        may be found in my book of 1962. These studies led researchers
        to look for various ways to separate these compounds. For a
        given solvent, results may vary according to acid concentration
        and temperature. My former colleague at the Conseil d’Hygience
        in Paris, Gabriel Bertrand, was convinced that transmutations
        occurred in the metabolism of living matter. He also showed me
        that P contents in ashes and in the dry material were different.
        Differences were of the order of 10% if reactions, on material
        dried at 100° C, were performed in a wet medium. At 200 C a loss
        of P was observed: this was mainly due to the fusion of of
        alkaline phosphates. Fusion produced a slag surrounding the
        particles of organic phosphorus which could not be decomposed by
        acids. Generally, these phospo-lipids and phospho-nucleic
        compounds have no close relation with Ca; their study may be
        ignored in research on Ca. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, phosphoro-proteids, which are not
        water-soluble, but are alkali soluble, are very important in
        fresh plants, though they are not widely found in animal
        tissues. Phytin was discovered during the 19th century. It is a
        hexaphosphoric ester of inositol, or more exactly it is a Ca and
        Mg salt of this ester. In 1903, Posternak established that
        organic P accounted for 22% of the phytin, Ca for 12% and Mg for
        1.5%. therefore there are large quantities of Ca. Inositol is a
        polyaclohol widely distributed throughout plants. In grain
        plants it accounts for approximately 50% of the total P and over
        70% in sunflowers. In his thesis, Colin describes the techniques
        which were perfected since the beginning of this century. These
        techniques were primarily developed by Javillier around 1930; we
        both sat together on the Conseil d’Hygience. He modified the
        analytical technique developed by Copeau in 1927. Mineralization
        comes about through a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids (to
        which Baranger added some concentrated hydrogen peroxide).
        Phospho-amino-lipids are first extracted. Some per-compounds are
        explosive and must be handled with care. One must follow
        carefully the instructions given by the specialists in this type
        of research. For our study of Ca, the important analyses concern
        acid-soluble P and then mineral P. To separate phytinic P from
        total P, Colin had to develop a technique derived from
        Javillier’s procedure. This was because the P in the seeds of
        cereal plants differ markedly from the nucleic acid formed in
        lentils. The presence of iron modifies the sequence of the
        reactions and requires the use of hydrochloric acid. </p>
      <p>In 100 grams of dry powder of lentil seeds or of oats, there
        are 300-400 mg of P in total. 50% of this total is in phytin; a
        little over 10% is lipid P and a similar amount is nucleic P.
        The ratio of the last two kinds varies little during
        germination. As they are not linked to the production of ca, we
        will not show any data for them. Colin quotes results for
        batches of 400 lentils picked every third day after the lentils
        were prepared for germination. Here are the weights in mg for
        each batch: </p>
      <p><i>P (Phytin) ~ P (Mineral) ~ P (Total)</i> <br>
        Before Germination: 50.63 ~ 18.30 ~ 92.00 <br>
        After 3 days: 38.31 ~ 30.84 ~ 93.65 <br>
        After 6 days: 12.64 ~ 54.61 ~ 90.00 <br>
        After 9 days: 0 ~ 62.30 ~ 87 </p>
      <p>Other analyses were made after 12 days and after 33 days. We
        will not discuss the results here. The main point is that the P
        in phytin decreased significantly after 3 days and that it
        decreased by approximately ¾ after 6 days. It is around the 4th
        and 5th days that the rapid transformation of phytin P into
        mineral P takes off. There is also a progressive decrease in
        total P, which was confirmed by other studies on soybeans and on
        vetch and oats. I shall come back to this point. It is
        remarkable that all the organic P in the phytin disappeared
        after 9 days, as it was transformed into mineral P. </p>
      <p>In the seed, mineral phosphates of Ca and Mg amount to about
        one-half of the P contained in phytin. The Mg is negligible. In
        the plant there is no more phytin after 9 days and mineral P is
        a little over 3 times greater than in the seed. Therefore, if
        the mineral phosphate in the plant is neglected by the
        experimenter because it is not soluble in HCl, the amount the
        amount of Ca in the plant is underestimated. This is the
        opposite of what was stated by the professor of botany mentioned
        in the previous chapter. </p>

      <p>When one wants to check a phenomenon, witnessed by another
        person, it is not right to give an opinion on the validity of
        the phenomenon unless the procedure used to establish it is
        strictly followed. If one parameter is different and if the
        author’s conclusions are not confirmed, it is right to first ask
        of the failure of the experiment is not due to the change in the
        procedure and to the neglect of some essential points. </p>
      <p>In other words, the verification of an experiment requires the
        exact duplication of the experimental conditions set by the
        researcher who established the existence of the phenomenon. It
        is legitimate to innovate only after this has been done. </p>
      <p>Too often operators attempting to duplicate experiments modify
        the procedure described by the inventor. They do so for several
        reasons. </p>
      <p>In the goal they pursue they underestimate the importance of
        some points of an experiment, which is new to them. This may be
        due to ignorance or to professional bias. Some extremely complex
        fields of research require a good knowledge of nuclear physics
        and chemistry, and an outstanding knowledge of biology. This is
        the case for biological transmutations which are biophysical
        phenomena which can be detected by wet chemical analysis or
        physical chemical analysis. </p>
      <p><b>(1) Study of the Calcium Variation in Cultivated Oats ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>We will look at a study performed by a team, composed of a
        physicist and a phytobiologist, in an American university. </p>
      <p>They wanted to check if there was an effective increase in Ca
        and an effective decrease in K during germination as compared to
        the initial amounts in the seeds. Germination took place in
        ultra-pure water. No Ca could be derived from the water nor from
        the bottles used for the experiment. This was checked prior to
        the beginning of the experiment. </p>
      <p>Theoretically, according to classic rules, the Ca balance, as
        well as the K balance, should not change, because "nothing is
        lost, nothing is created". This is true in chemistry. However,
        this does not apply to some specific biological processes
        involving not only chemical reactions but also prior to them,
        phenomena ruled by nuclear physics. Chemistry deals with
        phenomena involving electrons, and in general only the outer
        shell electrons of the atom. Electromagnetic energies, it would
        seem, cannot cause any transmutations. There are various reasons
        for this, but they will not be discussed here. These
        transmutations can happen under the effect of strong or weak
        interactions as it will be explained in Part II of this book. </p>
      <p>After performing only one experiment, these American scientists
        concluded that my observations were in error. For the K/Ca
        ratio, they found an average value of 4.5 for the seeds and only
        1.5 for the plants after germination and after too short a
        cultivation period, in my judgment. From the outset, they should
        have attributed K/Ca variations either to a decrease in K, or to
        an increase in Ca, or to simultaneous variations of K and Ca.
        Let’s more closely examine the reasons which led to their
        conclusions. </p>
      <p>They analyzed three aliquot parts of a batch of seeds and of
        plants grown from "identical" seeds. I will not cast any
        judgment on this technique, which, it seems, was used for the
        first time in this case. It might be a mistake to try a new
        technique in this instance. Though I know of so many scientists
        who are prisoners of their habits and sometimes of their
        equipment and who are incapable of admitting that they are
        wrong. To them, their technique is the best; they adopted it
        once and for all. This is a conceited attitude common to too
        many scientists. It is a mistake. Various techniques should be
        used for cross-checking. </p>
      <p>For example, I observed some unacceptable discrepancies in
        analytical data obtained by complexometry techniques for Ca. The
        nature of the complexing agent must be adapted to the Mg/Ca
        ratio in the solution analyzed. In spite of a double
        precipitation, the same is true for analyses by means of oxalate
        salts. Specific techniques are legitimate in some cases and not
        in others. In the same way, precipitations must be performed in
        the right sequence. Otherwise a particular molecule may be made
        insoluble to the detriment of subsequent reactions.
        Unfortunately knowing and remembering this point is not enough.
        This is the case in experiments involving biological
        transmutations, when the outcome of a first transmutation is
        unknown in advance. A technique may be valid for the control and
        not for the end product due to the modifications caused by the
        transmutation in the ratios between some elements. Two steps of
        an experiment may not always be cross-checked with the same
        technique if one wants to reach the right conclusions. </p>
      <p>Of course I do not object to chemical analyses, but the point
        emphasized above should always be kept in mind. I always used
        the atomic absorption spectrometry technique for the analysis of
        Ca (or Mg, Fe, etc.) to obviate the uncertainties presented by
        some chemical techniques and to prevent (often ungenerous)
        objections by experimenters imbued by their own technique.
        Uncertainties in chemical procedure can generally be cleared,
        once the experiment is mastered and once its results have become
        reproducible. This requires that the parameters of the
        experiment be maintained constant. Zundel used a chemical
        technique, developed by Prof Charlot, for the analysis of Ca in
        oat seeds and plants. The material is heated to 950° C to avoid
        the formation of carbonates, and to insure that all Ca in the
        final reaction is in the form of CaO. The CaO is weighed to 1/10
        mg for each batch. The amount of Ca is then computed. With this
        technique, Zundel obtained fairly constant figures, though they
        were always slightly higher than those given by atomic
        absorption spectrophotometry. This was true for both seeds and
        plant so that the ratios between the Ca contents in the seed and
        in the plant are independent of the analytical techniques.
        Variations in the absolute value of Ca may be ascribed to
        various causes: calibration differences in the physical
        technique or the presence of contaminants not precipitated
        previously in the chemical analysis. Despite these factors,
        comparative results obtained by these two techniques often show
        little difference. Balances are usually reproducible to a few
        percentage points with each technique. Too many physicists, even
        chemists and biologists tend to ignore, underestimate or neglect
        differences from one biological batch to the next. Among seed as
        among animals, there are vigorous subjects and there are weaker
        subjects. At times differences in the nature of the subject can
        be detected chemically or by analysis of the isotopes. The
        isotopic composition of an element does not necessarily
        translate to an organic compound of the same element. The
        chemical formula for its three main components, H, O and C, are
        not the same for cane sugar as for beet sugar. In biology
        calculations should not be based on standard atomic masses,
        which are average values as stated in our books. Although they
        are precisely defined, they are only arbitrarily selected
        standard values. In reality there is no such thing as isotopic
        selectivity. </p>
      <p>This is why, in my studies, I decided to accept only variations
        greater than 5% in average values for the elements considered.
        It is understood that the number of analyses performed must be
        sufficient to yield statistically valid averages. </p>
      <p>Several cross-checks by neutron activation performed in
        authorized nuclear physics laboratories showed that the
        technique was also valid for Ca. Magnitudes were approximately
        the same as those found by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
        With a minimum of 5 readings, measurement dispersion was smaller
        than 4%. Neutron activation, which is non-destructive, should
        not be used to first test a seed and then the palnt grown from
        this seed. I was able to establish that the plant’s germinating
        factors were altered by this technique. The plant metabolism is
        modified and transmutation, which are produced by enzymes, are
        slowed down. (please refer to my book of 1975, p. 233). </p>
      <p>From the beginning of my research 20 years ago, I abandoned
        chemical techniques for K analysis. Prof Baranger of Ecole
        Polytechnique in Paris, a chemical analysis specialist, finally
        abandoned the chemical analysis of K after he had obtained
        questionable results for several years. Zundel, a chemical
        engineering graduate from the Zurich Polytechnicum, who
        supervised a chemical analysis laboratory, also abandoned the
        chemical analysis of K from the start of his studies on
        transmutation during the germination of oats. We used emission
        flame spectrometry despite the inherent difficulties in reducing
        measurement discrepancies from one sample to the next. </p>
      <p>The flame spectrometer is still an instrument which is
        difficult to set for good reproducibility. It is now used by
        everybody, as there is no better instrument for the various
        purposes. Many readings are required with this instrument to get
        statistically valid results. There are some reservations on the
        various statistical methods prevailing in different countries as
        all these methods are based on arbitrary postulates. </p>
      <p>It is impossible to obtain statistically valid conclusions on
        biological samples from a small number of analyses performed on
        aliquot parts, which are sometimes too light in weight to start
        with. Usually we make 5 to 10 readings on a given sample. At
        times we made up to 50 tests. Baranger tested up to 300 and even
        400 samples one by one. On the other hand, it seems that only
        three analyses were performed in the USA. The results obtained
        were so scattered that they were statistically invalid.
        Nevertheless, it was the basis for the negative conclusions
        expressed by the scientists who performed the experiment even
        though the average data showed a large variation of the K/Ca
        ratio. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Biological Conditions ~</b> </p>
      <p>Ca and K variations during the germination of oats observed in
        the USA were different in absolute value from those we had
        customarily observed during tens of congruent experiments. These
        experiments included hundreds of analyses performed on thousands
        of plants and tens of thousands of seeds. This consideration led
        us to carefully examine the content of the report written by
        these scientists. </p>
      <p>It showed us also that they underestimated or ignored some
        biological factors. </p>
      <p>We recommended oats for the study of Ca, as this plant was
        extensively studied and it showed clear results. The increase in
        Ca is considerable, often greater than 100%, independently of
        the batch or the species, when the seed is germinated in
        twice-distilled water with an acid pH (5.6-5.8). The oat plant
        grows on acid soils, hence it is clearly a calcifuge. The seed
        contains little Ca, an element necessary for the first reactions
        for the germination process. Ca is required until growth
        hormones are synthesized. After 8-10 days the total Ca content
        of the seed and the seedling begins to increase very rapidly at
        the expense of K, although no Ca can come from the outside. The
        seed is rich in K as its K/Ca ratio is approximately 4.5 and
        varies little for different species. It constitutes the reserve
        for the growth of the plant. This ratio decreases the reserve
        for the growth of the plant. This ratio decreases to about 1.8
        over 3-4 weeks and then declines asymptotically to 1.5, the
        minimum value reached after 6 weeks. After this time the K
        reserves are too low to compensate for Ca and the pant starts to
        wilt. We do not know if the pH was&nbsp; measured in the
        American study. The pH is not mentioned in the text we received.
        It is not critical in this particular case, because the water pH
        was certainly acid. </p>
      <p>It seems to me that unsatisfactory cultivation conditions are
        the primary reason why no statistically valid increase in Ca was
        found. A researcher should not try to innovate while exploring
        entirely new grounds. He should follow the instructions of the
        people who have long experience with the phenomenon and who have
        mastered this phenomenon only after extensive research. </p>
      <p>My attention was drawn to a short sentence mentioning that the
        germination was performed under artificial fluorescent lighting
        with a lamp of the warm white type. As I have studied
        fluorescent lighting over 20 years, I jumped. The warm white
        lamp gives a spectrum which appears close to the solar spectrum
        to our eye. It enables agronomists to easily detect color
        changes in the seedlings. However, such lamps should not be used
        for photosynthesis. Plants and the human eye have very different
        sensitivities to light spectra. </p>
      <p>In the beginning our studies were only made under sunlight, to
        approximate natural conditions for the plant as closely as
        possible and to prevent the introduction of an additional
        unknown. After a few years, various considerations forced us to
        use artificial lighting. We needed to experiment at various
        times and in various seasons at poorly lit locations. Some
        varieties of oats, often called winter oats, are sown in fall,
        others at the beginning of spring. It took years of research and
        the help of discharge lamp specialists to select the right
        lamps. Only these lamps could radiate the short wavelengths in
        the blue, violet and UV which are so important for
        photosynthesis. Wavelengths in the red, which carry heat, are
        also well represented in the spectrum of these lamps. On the
        other hand these lamps radiate very little in the yellow, the
        band of maximum sensitivity for our eye. </p>
      <p>This research led to the development of lamps with spectra well
        tailored to photosynthesis. For visual observation, lamps of the
        warm white type or equivalent are needed. However, they are only
        used intermittently and they cannot replace solar light in any
        way for photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>The phytolamps used were usually rated at 250 watts and
        sometimes at 400 watts. This was a high but necessary power
        rating. These lamps radiate a great deal of heat and they must
        be located outside the cultivation chambers. The chambers are
        not made of glass, but of metacrylate. For supply considerations
        Altuglas rather than Plexiglass was used. Metacrylate, as glass,
        absorbs some UV wavelengths. The bands filtered change according
        to the material. Therefore, plants cultivate under glass or
        metacrylate are affected differently by light photons than
        plants grown in the open under sunlight. For this reason we
        placed a small lamp inside the chamber rated at a few watts,
        which radiated complementary wavelengths in the near UV. With
        this lighting, we obtained plants as vigorous and as rich in Ca
        as plants grown under direct, unfiltered sunlight. </p>
      <p>The American researchers stated that their seedlings were more
        yellow (chlorosis) and more flaccid than those normally grown in
        sunlight. They did not mention if they had considered the
        possibility of deficiencies in photosynthesis. Another effect of
        this process is easily checked. Under this mechanism, the plant
        produces some dry material from various synthesized carbohydrate
        compounds (glucids, lipids, parotids, etc.). Lignin, composed of
        the resulting celluloses (hemicellulose, etc.) contributes to
        plant system rigidity. The stems of the plants grown by the
        Americans remained flaccid and bent. This was a sure sign of
        deficient photosynthesis. In order to form carbohydrates, the
        plant takes its carbon from the carbon dioxide in the air and
        its H and O from the water absorbed by its roots. A satisfactory
        photosynthesis is therefore indispensable to plant metabolism
        and for the synthesis of essential growth enzymes; it is
        absolutely necessary for the good health of the plant. An enzyme
        linked to oxidizing phosphorylation, and created at the internal
        surface of the mitochondria inside the envelope, is responsible
        for the formation of Ca from K with Mg as a catalyst. The enzyme
        active in this reaction is derived from ATP chelated with Mg
        (Mg-ATPase). This is a point I discussed in my books. Another
        point was presented by S. Goldfein in a report written for and
        published by the scientific section of the US Amy in Fort
        Belvoir, CA in 1978. Without the normal activity of this enzyme,
        there is a deficient plant metabolism and a transmutation which
        is too weak to yield significant amounts of Ca. This happened in
        the experiment performed in the USA. The seedlings were weak and
        stunted. The stems were only a few centimeters long. During the
        same growing period, we obtained firm and erect stems 20-20 cm
        long. We also obtained a much greater weight for the dry
        material, and even for the ashes, than for the seeds. A poor
        photosynthetic action prevents the formation of carbohydrates.
        Furthermore, the weights for the dry material or the ashes are
        smaller than the seed weights because of the exhaustion of the
        seed reserves due to the release of CO<sub>2</sub> in the
        atmosphere during respiration. </p>
      <p>Another point deserves attention. In a controlled atmosphere,
        the incoming air should contain some CO<sub>2</sub> as a source
        for the photosynthetic process. To prevent any external Ca
        contamination, this air must be filtered. It should be bubbled
        through an HCl solution contained in a flask, so that any trace
        of Ca, which escaped from the filter, would be retained. To
        neutralize any trace of acid carried by air bubbles, it would
        then be bubbled through a flask containing a basic solution. The
        base should not be NaOH which would absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. NaHCO<sub>3</sub>
        was used because it lets CO<sub>2</sub> go through freely. We
        noted no clues in the report we received from the USA which
        would lead us to believe that these precautions were ever taken.
        After scrubbing in acid and basic solutions, the incoming air is
        scrubbed in a flask containing pure, twice-distilled water
        before it lets CO<sub>2</sub> go through freely. We noted no
        clues in the report we received from the USA which would lead us
        to believe that these precautions were never taken. After
        scrubbing in acid and basic solutions, the incoming air is
        scrubbed in a flask containing pure, twice distilled water
        before entering the closed chamber. The chamber is maintained at
        a low positive pressure of about 3 mm W.G. to prevent any
        unwanted air intake through the gasket. </p>
      <p>We will mention another study related to the function of CO<sub>2</sub>.
        Photosynthesis develops very poorly without this gas. It is only
        active for a very short time in the morning when the plant
        absorbs the CO<sub>2</sub> it released during the night by
        respiration. During the night the plant draws on its reserves of
        oxygen and carbon and in doing so, becomes weaker. The period of
        activity corresponds to the time the light is turned on each day
        when artifical light is used. The inverse experiment was also
        performed by increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the air
        supply to the chamber. Zundel showed that a large increase in
        the CO<sub>2</sub> concnetration (about 10 times the normal
        concentration in atmospheric air) led to an unsatisfactory plant
        metabolism. There is excess carbon. This requires an abnormal
        increase in both the absorption of carbon and in the
        decomposition, which generates hydrogen and oxygen. As vein
        sections are too small, the plant weakens and grows sickly. On
        the other hand an increase of 2-3 times the natural CO<sub>2</sub>
        concentration in the air is beneficial. Some algae, chlorella
        for example, are cultivated in atmosphere rich in CO<sub>2</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>At this range of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration we observed a new
        phenomenon. The increase in Ca was very large (500-600%) and it
        could not be ascribed solely to the decrease in K. Analyses
        showed that Si decreased very significantly, but insufficiently
        to account for the increase in Ca. </p>
      <p>This phenomenon does not occur in a natural atmosphere as was
        shown in the work with oat plants. Various analyses, chemical as
        well as physical, supported this. In atmospheres overloaded with
        CO<sub>2</sub>, there was a large decrease in SiO<sub>2</sub>
        stored in the seed. This was not entirely surprising. We knew
        that in Nature there was a partial inverse compensation between
        Ca and Si under specific conditions, which have not yet been
        completely studied. We studied the reaction Si<sup>14</sup> + C<sup>6</sup>
        &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>20</sup> in various books. </p>
      <p>This explains why horsetail (equisitum) silica was used in
        phytotherapy in antiquity to recalcify patients. It was
        necessary to harvest the horsetail at the end of spring,
        therefore at the end of the period of full growth, so the
        silicon would be present as part of organic compounds and not
        under the prevailing form of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Silicon is stored
        as mineral SiO<sub>2</sub> in the rhyzome of the pant during
        fall and winter. Similarly, I made a detailed presentation (See
        <i>Preuves en Biologie...</i>) of the research by the great
        French chemist Vauquelin on the balance of Ca in laying hens.
        These hens were only fed oats. "Lime" was measured after
        precipitation of the carbonates and phosphates contained in the
        oats and in the excretions from the hens (eggs and droppings). A
        large increase in the "lime" balance was noted during these
        experiments. Vauquelin thought that this "earth" or lime (we
        would call it today an alkaline mineral compound) could only
        come from another "earth" contained in oats, silica. At the
        time, knowledge of the atom was nonexistent. He could not
        imagine that the K<sup>19</sup> + H<sup>1</sup> &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>20</sup>
        reaction was possible. During his measurements, he observed that
        the increase in CaO was greater than the clearly measurable
        decrease in SiO<sub>2</sub>. From this he concluded with a very
        modern rational that Ca could not come totally from Si. The
        problem still has not been resolved. We see how long ago&nbsp;
        (1799) the inverse relation between Si and Ca was noted. We will
        not discuss here the hypothesis which would explain the presence
        of Ca as coming from the excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Research on this
        subject is still too speculative. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Conclusions ~</b> </p>
      <p>We showed some of the weaknesses in the studies made in the
        USA, or at least in the documents which were forwarded to us.
        Even trained researchers with a background in a different field
        can make mistakes. For example, Prof Baranger decided to limit
        his study to a single vetch species, Vicia Sativa. He selected
        it for a reason of convenience because the seeds were very
        nearly round and easy to gauge, without any regard for the
        vegetal biology aspect. To achieve great accuracy in his
        measurements, he would weigh 10 seeds from a Petri dish to 1/100
        mg, which is difficult. Each batch of control seeds was weighed
        separately. So was each batch of plants, growing on two layers
        of extra-pure and ash-free paper, moistened with twice distilled
        water. For the integrity of the experiment, the data obtained on
        the batches of seeds and on the batches of 3-4 week old plants
        were handed over to a mathematician, specialized in statistics.
        Baranger always analyzed a minimum of 100 batches of seed
        controls and of 300-400 batches of plants. The data obtained
        from these hundreds of analyses showed that in average, there
        was a significant increase in Ca in the seedlings during
        germination. </p>
      <p>However, this increase in Ca, which was statistically
        established, looked too small to me. It was neither impressive
        nor spectacular. The increase was usually in the 2-3% range, and
        seldom did it reach 6-9%. I always express reservations on the
        1% accuracy level in the chemical analysis of biological
        materials. Batches of seeds age. Batches extracted from a given
        stock over a period of one year are not endowed with the same
        vitality during their respective experiments. Even a germination
        rate of 95% or more does not guarantee 1% accuracy. Seeds, as
        with individuals of a same species, have different innate
        strengths; their enzymes are not equally active. Averaging the
        data from hundreds of experiments obviously alleviates the
        problem created by these differences. After selecting vetch
        seeds for handling convenience, Baranger looked for optimal
        germination conditions. He noted that in twice distilled water
        the increase in Ca was very small. It increased somewhat up to
        6-9% when a Ca salt was added to the water. After trying various
        salts, he selected calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The
        additional Ca was added to the Ca content of the seed. The sum
        was then subtracted from the sum of the Ca contents of the
        plants and of the filter paper impregnated with the excretions
        from the plants. Prof Baranger had to recognize that seeds,
        stored for a long time, became moldy as soon as they were
        dampened. Should then the transformations be ascribed to the
        molds or to enzymes in the seed? </p>
      <p>We noted that Baranger never mentioned the pH of the culture
        medium in is reports. He found that additional Ca strengthened
        the plant, but he apparently was not aware that this effect was
        a calcicole property of vetch, which grows better in the
        presence of a little Ca, in an alkaline soil. This is not a
        clearly calcifuge plant, like oats, which requires an acid
        medium, a generator of protons, in order to produce the
        reaction. Vetch does not have the enzymes required to form the
        additional Ca needed for plant growth. There ism hence, a very
        small increase in Ca in the plant, usually less than 5% in
        average. On the other hand, on the oat plant, the increase is
        sometimes greater than 100% when it is cultivated in an acid
        medium. Such is not the case when the variations observed are 5%
        or less. For example, Baranger’s research on P seems to show a
        decrease in P in the range of 1-1.5%. This is questionable even
        if the precautions taken tend to validate these figures. I
        should add that Baranger’s report does not give any indication
        that he was worried about the artificial light spectrum for the
        glass case he used in his experiments. When I visited his
        laboratory, he had no phytolamps with spectra adapted to
        photosynthesis. He used a Daylight-type lamp, adapted to human
        vision. The few experiments performed in sunlight were made
        under a glass cover which protected the medium from falling
        dust, but not from floating dust. His seedling trays were
        located in a narrow courtyard, or rather a ventilation well,
        next to his laboratory. There was no direct sunlight at all. All
        his seedlings were deficient in chlorophyll. This might explain
        the small size of the variations obtained. </p>
      <p>In spite of every precaution he can think of, a specialist in
        chemistry and biological chemistry may overlook some aspects of
        an experiment, because he is too specialized. Yet Baranger
        established, in the course of 10 years of research, that in
        Nature there were variations in some elements which could not be
        explained&nbsp; by the theories included in official teachning
        programs. Nature can do more than chemistry. Baranger did not
        want to hypothesize on the causes of the variations. He did not
        want to go against established nuclear physical theories and he
        chose to limit himself to his specialty and to remain
        exclusively in the domain of experimentation. However, we see
        that it is necessary to leave traditional practices and to use a
        large number of different techniques which are often difficult
        to unify. </p>
      <p>It was even more difficult for two specialized researchers in
        the USA to reach valid conclusions after making only one series
        of experiments on small batches (usually 30 seeds each) and to
        avoid major pitfalls. </p>
      <p><b>Final Remarks ~</b> </p>
      <p>I would like this last experiment to be duplicated again in
        this university or another. Then the points made in the present
        document could be taken into consideration. As preparation, I
        believe that it is indispensable to perform a series of
        experiments on oats only, as this plant was the subject of many
        studies. These studies allow the experimenter to locate errors,
        as there is by now a solid database for oats established over a
        long period of experimentation. </p>
      <p>For health and age reasons, I cannot travel any more and I
        declined invitations to travel in the USA, from the Los Angeles
        Park Service, for example. Following experiments based on my
        work, the Park Service modified its application of fertilizers.
        The concepts of classical agronomy have been borrowed directly
        from chemistry. They lead to excesses or deficiencies injurious
        to the plant. What the plant needs is not what is found in the
        mature plant, at the end of its metabolism. We saw that this was
        true of Ca. It is also true for other elements. These needs vary
        according to the soil and the plant species (calcicole or
        calcifuge, for example). The whole of agronomy must be
        reconsidered. The same is true for animal husbandry, and human
        and animal dietetics. Many dietetic or medical publications deal
        with applications of transmutation, a property of living matter.
        These transmutations are produced under conditions controlled by
        nuclear physics and unrelated to the strong interactions which
        lead to the atomic bomb. The Life process is gentle. Those of my
        works which were published after1974 show how this phenomenon
        can be integrated in the physics of neutral currents or weak
        interactions. </p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> Other experiments were duplicated in the USA in a
        school, in which a student presented a paper several tens of
        pages long each year. The studies were related to several kinds
        of plants (oats, wheat, soybeans, barley, gumbo-okra) and to
        various elements (P, Mg, Ca, K, Na). I did not mention them
        before, because it seemed to me that the students overlooked
        some important parameters. They did not contact me, nor did
        their professors. I only received the data later. I did not have
        sufficient details to judge if the excessive dispersions of the
        results should be ascribed to errors in the growing procedure,
        to mistakes in the preparation of samples to be analyzed, or to
        any other causes. </p>
      <p>The same is true for the studies directed by Komaki. I cannot
        accept the figures I received for various elements in different
        kinds of pants: rice, soybeans, garlic and azuki, a species of
        small beans. In fact, all these studies show that the respective
        compositions of a plant and of its seed are always different.
        Also in France working groups of students preparing for the BTS
        exam (Brevet de Technicien Superieur) in agronomy proceeded to
        do various studies. However, the most important precautions
        mentioned above were not taken. I could not comment on the
        variations observed in the data. The same was true for studies
        made in Switzerland, Germany and other countries. This is why I
        thought it important to publish the information presented in
        this document. </p>

      </p>
      <p>In the second half of 1979 I learned that the microanalysis
        laboratory of CNRS just acquired a mass spectrometer of a new
        model linked to a computer. It could measure the elements
        quantitatively, as previous instruments gave only rough
        quantitative indications: "traces", or if the line was clear,
        the designation of the element was followed by one, two, or
        three stars. Therefore, I had never been able to cross-check
        positive ion contents by any spectroscopic method. The
        determination of the P content was important as it was accepted
        that the P/Ca ratio was close to 606.5 for oats when P was
        determined by chemical techniques. Although I have described
        above some aspects of the complex quest for various P compounds,
        I ignored some other points. For example, the presence of
        manganese prevents the analysis of P. It is eliminated before
        molybdate is added. The Mn content in oats is small and it is
        close to the Fe content. A part of the P, remaining in the form
        of undetermined compounds, is ignored, but it has little effect
        on the total results of the analysis. </p>
      <p>For better accuracy, it was necessary to eliminate the error on
        the low side which was due to seed and plant incineration. For
        this reason, I requested from CNRS a mass spectroanalysis of
        various positive and negative ions, in order to cross-check the
        results obtained by the other techniques. We sent to CNRS powder
        samples obtained after drying the material at 85° C for 72 hours
        and grinding it. This was below the limit of 100° C recommended
        by Gabriel Bertrand, the temperature at which he operated. By
        working at lower temperatures, the vaporization of some organic
        P compounds and the formation of alkaline slags, insoluble in
        subsequent reactions, were prevented. The data presented below
        for P and Ca only are given for cross-checking purposes. Let’s
        keep in mind that only one cross-check experiment was made, and
        that the values represent the average of two measurements. I
        received a written confirmation of this data in early January
        1980. The figures are expressed in milligrams of the particular
        element per 100 gr of dry material. </p>
      <p><i>S/P/V: P ~ Ca</i> <br>
        Seed: 485 ~ 76 <br>
        Plants: 310 ~ 115.5 <br>
        Variation: =175 ~ +39.5 </p>
      <p>The P/Ca ratio is of 6.5, therefore normal. Consequently, I
        believe the calibration to be correct. This analysis, which was
        performed in a French laboratory, does not represent an absolute
        proof. The experiment should be repeated many times. As I was
        only looking for a cross-check and, as the data was compatible
        with the data obtained by other techniques, we may accept the
        data as reliable. They confirm once more that some variations
        occur in the amounts of some elements during the germination of
        oats, although no additional amount of these elements was
        brought from the outside during that period. It was not the
        purpose of the CNRS experiment to prove that the increase in Ca
        was linked to the decrease in P. Experiments of a completely
        different type would be needed for that. It is obvious that
        there is no quantitative relationship between the absolute
        values for Ca and P. These discrepancies cannot be attributed to
        errors in the experimental procedure as there are increases for
        some elements and decreases for others. The figures tabulated
        above are not absolutely accurate, because the dry weight of the
        seed, from which the seedling originates, is not exactly the
        same as the dry weight of the control seed. The average weights
        for seed and seedling were computed over hundreds of trial.
        These computations showed little quantitative variation and no
        qualitative variation in the data shown above. This is the
        reason why I do not reproduce here the details of these
        experiments. They were published in the scientific press in
        French, English, and other languages. </p>
      <p>As the quantitative bases are different, it is not legitimate
        to compare percentage variations, as some people are tempted to
        do. After standardization, there is a 32% decrease in P and a
        52% increase in Ca. It would be absurd to state that there is an
        appropriate compensation around 44 ± 8%. </p>
      <p>After receiving a confirmation of the P concentrations in oats
        at the beginning of 1980, I decided to further investigate the
        relative importance of the Ca which is insoluble in HCl. This is
        Ca linked to the phosphates. I wanted to use these new figures
        to prove wrong those who still insisted that the variations in
        chemical balances came from inappropriate chemical analysis
        procedures. These statements were unwarranted: furthermore, they
        contradict the conclusions drawn by their authors. Zundel
        performed three additional experiments on a total number of 870
        seeds and seedlings. He gave me the results in late
        November-early December 1980. I received enough data to be able
        to form an opinion. Peniarth oats used were supplied by INRA.
        The seeds weighed an average of 34.21 mg each. Seeds and
        seedlings were then incinerated at 950° C and chemical analyses
        were performed using Prof Charlot’s technique. The weight of the
        material which was insoluble in HCl was 0.013 mg. The amount of
        Ca in this material was then determined. The following results
        were obtained: </p>
      <p>Ca content in insoluble material per seed: 0.0032 <br>
        Average Ca content in insoluble material per seedling: 0.0319 </p>
      <p>The second figure is equal to almost 10 times the first one.
        This confirms that an important molecular transformation
        happened, and it transferred a very large quantity of Ca into
        the insoluble state. Neglecting the Ca linked to the insoluble
        material leads to a very sizable underestimation of the Ca
        production during the germination of oats. This contradicts the
        statements made by our professors of botany a few chapters back.
        Soluble Ca measured in the seed averaged over the 3 experiments
        had a weigh of 0.033 mg. The average weight for each plant was
        of 0.0511 mg or an increase in Ca amounting to 55%. </p>
      <p>It is appropriate to state here the amount of Ca which passed
        from the roots into the water of the cultivation medium. I also
        requested an analysis of the water. Per plant this amount was of
        0.0051 mg, or approximately 1/10 the amount of the content in
        the plant. </p>
      <p>To summarize: </p>
      <p>Ca: In Seed ~ In Plant </p>
      <p>Ca insoluble: 0.0032 ~ 0.0319 <br>
        Ca soluble: 0.0350 ~ 0.0511 <br>
        Ca in water at end of experiment: --- ~ 0.0051 <br>
        Total: 0.0382 ~ 0.0881 </p>
      <p>Or an increase of 152% in total Ca. </p>
      <p>The comparisons can only be approximate because the measurement
        of Ca was only performed by chemical analysis on the ashes.
        However, the direction the variations are taking remains the
        same. The increase in soluble Ca from the seed to the seedling
        should also be noted. It is 55%. The data given by CNRS shows a
        corresponding increase of 52% after mass spectrometer analysis
        and standardization to 100 gr of dry material in both seeds and
        seedlings. I was not briefed by CNRS about their procedure for
        preparing the material prior to analysis by the spectrometer. I
        do not know if these measurements were performed directly on a
        powder, on a spark or on a solution. In any case, the two
        figures are very close (52 vs 55%). In both cases there is a
        clear increase in Ca, which could not possibly result from an
        underestimation of the total Ca in the seed. On the contrary, if
        some techniques lend themselves to underestimation, they concern
        the seedlings and not the seeds. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion for this Chapter ~</b> <br>
        ] <br>
        I believe I have shown here that some chemists were conceited to
        the point of being laughable when they systematically, out of
        misplaced pride, rejected the findings of some of their
        colleagues. Why don’t they themselves perform repeatable
        experiments with verifiable quantified data? Unfortunately, many
        people tend to deny the validity of other people’s work. They
        alone can detect the shortcomings of their peers; they carefully
        avoid doing anything, so they do not run the risk of being
        wrong. It is so much easier. This is not science anymore; it is
        malicious polemics. </p>
      <p>I believe that the scientists mentioned here, all highly
        respectable in their profession, will accept that their research
        quoted in this document, will be checked. They all agree that
        analyses of various major elements show completely different
        results for the seed and the plants under strictly controlled
        conditions. Water used for the cultivation is twice distilled;
        the air is extra-pure. No contaminating mineral salts may be
        brought from the outside. They observed the facts
        experimentally. They gave quantified data. But they did not
        interpret their data, in the hopes of remaining totally
        objective. </p>
      <p>It is our role to interpret them. </p>
      <p>I did not mention empirical observations in industry, which
        were brought to my attention in 1960, because I wanted to
        dedicate the first chapters of this book to the increase in Ca
        in oats during germination. The curing of potting clay by
        potters has been practiced since antiquity. It is due to
        fermentation. So are the malting and the fermentation processes
        in breweries. How many more examples couldn’t we mention! </p>

      <p>In order to explain a phenomenon, one must place it in a
        framework accepted by at least the majority of scientists. </p>
      <p>After I established the existence of biological transmutations,
        I suggested global formulae at the atomic level. This was an
        entirely new idea at the time. It was then impossible for me to
        place these formulas in the frame of the strong interactions of
        the atomic bomb type, which was generally accepted. I was sure
        of the experimental results but these results could not be
        explained by the prevailing atomic physics of the time. I did
        not challenge this well-proven discipline in the least. As I had
        such strong evidence, I stated instead that we were dealing with
        a completely different phenomenon outside the realm of strong
        interactions. I had no accepted theory to propose, but I firmly
        stated that the strong force theory did not apply to the cases
        at hand and that it was up to the physicists to find another
        theory. </p>
      <p>Theories are built on facts and not the opposite, especially
        when it is obvious that specific phenomena cannot be explained
        by these theories. Too many physicists keep in forgetting it. I
        had the opportunity of mentioning some exceptions to this
        unfortunate behavior; among the exceptions are the respected
        scientists: O. Costa de Beauregard, R. de Puymorin, L. Romani,
        J. Barry and others in France. In Russia I referred to Dubrov,
        Nejman and Korolkov in my previous works; several others wrote
        to me on this subject. In the USA, there were Dudley, Myers,
        Maxey, Bird and others. In Japan, there were Sakurazawa,
        Odagiri, Maruyama and others. Zundel and a few others, such as
        J. Boucher, performed experiments and did not formulate any
        theories. This was also the case in the USA, Argentina, Canada,
        and India as well as in other countries. </p>
      <p>As there was no theory to explain these phenomena, I could only
        offer analogs to show that various structures of the components
        of the atomic nucleus were possible. I did this over a period of
        years. I showed that some schematic explanations, in fact simple
        vulgarizations based on the average energy per nucleus concept,
        were only figments of the mind. I showed that they could not be
        verified and that they were certainly wrong. There was room for
        other analogs. </p>
      <p>An analog necessarily gives a wrong view of a phenomenon. It
        leads to representing actions at the atomic or subatomic levels
        as if they were working at the level of our senses or of the
        cell. In fact, these actions cannot be detected at the molecular
        level, even less by our senses. </p>
      <p>These considerations are only secondary, because the general
        public is primarily interested in applications. Fortunately for
        our successors, we will leave them much to discover. As
        important as application may be, it is not everything. There is
        also the satisfaction of knowing, the interest found in abstract
        knowledge, which is a strong intellectual stimulus. </p>
      <p>We had to wait 15 years, until 1974, before theoretical physics
        brought us the elements which were formerly beyond our reach.
        The readers, who read the previous work I published in 1975, may
        have noted on page 281, that on July 23, 1874, I wrote to the
        physicist O. Costa de Beauregard to confirm the existence of
        neutral currents. These currents were first discovered in
        Weinberg and Salam’s theory. I believed that this theory could
        provide a base for the explanation of transmutations at low
        energies. This supported the role of neutrinos in the reactions
        I had proposed, a role I had suspected. By the second half of
        1974 de Beauregard had succeeded in refining the Weinberg-Salam
        theory and adapting it to my work. This adaptation was included
        as an epilogue to my book, dated December 1974 which was already
        at the printer.&nbsp; Dare say that shortly after that, in
        January 1975, a Nobel Prize official delegate nominated me for
        the prize in Physiology and Medicine. The physiologists did not
        want to take precedence over the physicists. Weinberg received
        his Nobel Prize in Physics only in 1979. This confirmed that
        this theory, the one I mentioned in 1974, was valid and
        internationally accepted. </p>
      <p>Those who have little interest in theoretical considerations
        may choose not to read Part II of this book, but I believe that
        many will try to understand it. I will attempt to be understood
        by the general scientific public; only the final chapter will be
        written for nuclear physicists. I will keep in mind that for
        many of these, this is a completely new and unknown subject. Due
        to their ever-increasing specialization, nuclear physicists tend
        to limit themselves to the physics of the strong force and to
        focus only on some parts of this widely expanding science. For
        them, this will be an introduction to the physics of weak
        interactions, a subject which is still little known, especially
        in this form. This branch of physics is too new to be the
        subject of many high quality publications. There is always a lag
        of several years between discoveries, the synthesis of the new
        information they brought, and the acceptance of this new
        information by the majority of the theoreticians. When I started
        planning for this book in late 1978, I thought I would complete
        it in 1979, and at that time no works on the physics of the weak
        interactions were available. I decided then to include a chapter
        on this subject. It is indeed somewhat abstract, but I believe
        it will be useful to the average scientist unfamiliar with this
        branch of physics. The situation evolved after the award of the
        1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. The subject is now better and more
        commonly known; I decided to modify the plan of this book. It is
        impossible to treat a subject in full evolution so the book
        remains up-to-date for several years. Therefore, I thought that
        the scope should be modest and kept general so it would not be
        contradicted by the discoveries in process. These discoveries
        fundamentally change the picture presented below. </p>
      <p>I will not mention strong interactions, which does not mean
        that I reject them. This would be silly on my part. However, it
        should be recognized that too many physicists and too many of
        their followers, scientists of various backgrounds, tend to
        grant too wide a scope to the data in nuclear physics. One can
        always argue about an extrapolation and sometimes an
        extrapolation may be plainly wrong. </p>
      <p>I do not wish to argue about Einstein’s laws. I accept them,
        although I do not always agree with the people who use them any
        old way. The postulates, on which they were based, should always
        be kept in mind. Indeed, Einstein never extrapolated these laws.
        E reminded his dogmatic worshippers about their limits. In
        particular, he noted that his laws did not apply to biology. He
        could not say why, but it was obvious that biological
        experiments were not ruled by his laws. Einstein did not know
        about the neutrino when he formulated his laws. He only knew
        that his knowledge was limited and that a lot of nonsense had
        been spoken and taught about the restricted relativity law E =
        MC<sup>2</sup>. In this law C<sup>2</sup> is a constant and M is
        proportional to E (and vice versa). It always remains a linear
        law, a first degree curve; in other words, a straight line. This
        is why he had to search for his General Relativity Law, in order
        to explain the curvature of light in the vicinity of large
        masses such as the sun or any large star. Curvature means change
        of velocity, a factor of the second order. So many scientists
        forget that M is not the stationary mass designated as Mo; it is
        in fact a relativistic mass. </p>
      <p>One often forgets also that the mass-energy conversion is not a
        simplistic rule. We do not know how to convert any old mass to
        energy. We first have to use some energy which produces
        anti-matter which in turn gives energy after annihilation. We do
        not know how to destroy a proton or a neutron. These particles
        remain unchanged in an atomic explosion or in a fission
        reaction. Only a small part of the linking energy between nuclei
        is used. I do not intend to discuss the heavy particles, the
        baryons, or their components, such as the quarks, or even the
        gluons which supposedly link the quarks. There are vast problems
        in this area which is in full evolution, but these problems do
        not concern the fields of weak energy. Indeed, we will mention
        the hadrons in our study of weak interactions. The first
        statement on the existence of weak interactions was made soon
        after the discovery of the neutron. Obviously, a neutron was not
        simply a proton plus an electron. There was a particle, which
        could not be detected at the time, but which was necessary to
        restore mass balance. It was named neutrino. A very careful
        study of natural radioactivity showed that there was an
        electromagnetic phenomenon, the emission of one electron, but
        that there was also the emission of one anti-neutrino.
        Similarly, we will introduce the notion of proton movement in
        the course of our study of weak interactions, in relation with
        other phenomena such as the tunnel effect or the effective
        section. </p>
      <p>We will study these phenomena a little later. Other particles
        must also be introduced. They are necessary to the theory, but
        they have not been experimentally isolated yet. These are some
        of the essential elements of the theory, for which the 1979
        Nobel Prize was awarded. They are the intermediary virtual
        vector bosons. We will spend a little more time on them. </p>
      <p>As early as July1974 I had focused on Weinberg’s theory, which
        was followed shortly by Salam’s theory. I related this fact in a
        letter excerpt in the book given to the printer at the end of
        1974 and published in early 1975. I applied this theory to a
        biological phenomenon I had discovered. But what is more
        important? The proof of the existence of a biological phenomenon
        or the theory behind it? It is not up to me to judge. I cannot
        be the judge and party at the same time. Furthermore, how should
        we judge when the problem straddles across biology and physics,
        and when specialists of either discipline will be called upon to
        cast a judgment. Each one tends to form an opinion on the basis
        of his own knowledge. It is only human. There are no
        interdisciplinary Nobel Prizes. There is a Prize in Physics,
        another in Physiology or Medicine. Specialization is a rule
        everywhere, especially in physics. The biologist does not want
        to innovate and he follows the physicist. This is why the
        official delegate who nominated me for the 1975 Nobel Prize I
        Physiology or Medicine was not followed by his colleagues on the
        Nominating Committee. He was not a Frenchman. Nobody is a
        prophet in his own backyard. Only in 1979 did the Physics
        Nominating Committee award their prize for the Weinberg-Salam
        theory which I had adopted 5 years earlier. Let’s not dwell on
        the past. The essential was to prove that a fact scientifically
        established after many indisputable experiments was in line with
        the classic theory. I am trying to show here that the clear
        evidence obtained for this phenomenon and its multiple
        implications, represent a major turning point for Science
        internationally. Theories other than Weinberg’s were proposed
        throughout the world to explain the phenomenon. I believe that
        the most widely accepted theory was proposed by the physicist de
        Beauregard. It was refined during the second half of 1974 and
        its principle was then accepted by Bernard d’Espagnet, a
        well-known atomic particle specialist. The theory was summarized
        in my book of 1975. It was not refuted, but it was only a
        schematic explanation. I completed this theory by introducing
        the intermediary vector bosons in various publications as early
        as 1976. This is the reason why I will give more attention to
        this theory and I will describe only briefly a few others, which
        incidentally provide very interesting complements to this
        theory. I will describe this complementary information in
        greater or lesser detail. </p>

      <p><b>(1) Process Proposed by a US Army Scientific Department ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>A department of the US Army Scientific and Technical Services
        headed by S. Goldfein studied my research. The team gathered for
        this purpose worked on the report from December 1977 to April
        1978, and the report was published in May 1978. It was
        distributed to numerous specialized service in the various
        branches of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, General
        Services). It included 28 pages, not counting the cover, and 8
        figures. In it Goldfein proposed an explanation based on
        physical chemistry, delineating a possible process which must
        still be developed and defined more precisely. </p>
      <p>Numerous calculations made by the authors of the report, too
        few according to them, showed homogeneous results. They showed
        that the reactions originating from my research confirmed a gain
        in energy. There was a new source of energy, which had to be
        investigated more closely. In our time no source of energy
        should be neglected just because it was insufficiently studied.
        This was the reason this agency, highly respected worldwide,
        decided to intervene. </p>
      <p>Classic physics shows that K + H &gt;&gt; Ca + 0.008 a.m.u.
        This means that in the reaction v + H + K &gt;&gt; Ca + <i>v</i>’,





        the energy taken by the outgoing neutrino v’ should be greater
        than the energy brought in by the incoming neutrino v. In other
        words, in biology the production of energy should not be limited
        to the sole exoenergetic chemical reactions. Exoenergetic
        reactions of physical origin should also be considered, although
        the energies involved are modest compared to the energy of
        fusion by the strong interaction. They are far from being
        negligible, as they result in a positive balance of
        approximately 40% for the cases studied. </p>
      <p>We noted from de Beauregard: <i>v</i> + <i>p</i> &gt;&gt; <i>v</i>’
        + <i>p</i>’ with <i>v</i>’ =/ <i>v</i> (see the last chapter
        in our book of 1975). The US Army Scientific Services state: v’
        &gt;&gt; v and v’ ~ v + 40%. Could this be attributed to a
        fusion process produced following a process other than the
        strong interactions process? </p>
      <p>The report describes an example based on the oxidative
        phosphorylation process in mitochondria. Some animal cells
        include up to 7,000 mitochondria. From the energetic point of
        view, the active molecule is ATP after chelation of one Mg atom
        (Mg-ATP) under the action of an enzyme, Mg-ATPase. I discussed
        this process in more details in my book of 1975, in particular
        on page 85. I first presented the beginning of its study in my
        book of 1968, now out of print. </p>
      <p>The US Army study shows also an action by D-ribose molecules
        interacting with the Mg-ATP to produce a rotation of the
        acyl-oxygen dipoles linked to P atoms. Schematic representations
        and computations lead to a helix with H+ ions in an unsaturated
        ionic structure. A link is established between the D-ribose and
        the form gamma oxygen. The Mg<sup>++</sup> chain electrons
        (axial chain of 10 Mg<sup>++</sup> in the study) produce an
        oscillating electric field leading to a resonance. An H<sup>+</sup>
        ion, introduced between the components of an OH and gamma-O
        pair, ends up on a circular helix trajectory of approximately 30
        Angstroms diameter under the dipole’s impulsion. Following this
        hypothesis, the hydrogen H<sup>+</sup> positive ions would
        finally acquire a very high rotational velocity. This would be a
        relativistic velocity, so to speak, due a cyclotron effect, such
        that H<sup>+</sup> would cross the potential barrier of an
        atomic nucleus and penetrate into it. If the proton receiver is
        an atom of K the reaction would be: K<sup>19</sup>+ + H<sup>1</sup>
        &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>20</sup>. </p>
      <p>The development of this hypothesis fills about 14 pages of the
        report. It is very interesting because it provides an
        explanation for a physico-biological process partially
        established by various studies. This hypothesis should be
        applied to other cases. I thought it was opportune to mention it
        here because the US Army could not pursue the research for lack
        of funds, as it commonly happens everywhere in the world. At
        least the agency wanted to show the solid bases for the
        hypothesis. </p>
      <p>In the first part of this chapter I did not intend to give my
        full and unconditional approval to the study. The author of the
        report was fully conscious that complementary studies were
        necessary and that the study completed constituted only a first
        step. He would have liked to receive sufficient funds to be able
        to take one more step. At the time I am writing these lines,
        this has still not occurred. </p>
      <p>It is obvious, for example, that special procedures should be
        applied for the measurements related to energy balances. These
        measurements are very complicated. Known calorimetric methods
        cannot be applied, because neutrinos intervene, as we are here
        in the domain of weak interactions. Neutrinos interact only very
        seldom with matter, A large part of the energy is carried away
        under a virtual form, so to speak. It goes through space without
        affecting our senses or our measurement instruments. How can we
        measure it? </p>
      <p>How can we measure the energetic contributions from enzymes or
        from ATP? Here we are dealing at the molecular level. There are
        uncertainties in the values measured indirectly by methods based
        on theories which may be questioned in the future. </p>
      <p>Many more points need to be investigated more thoroughly. Much
        uncertainty remains regarding the quantitative study of energy
        balances and also regarding the qualification of the operator.
        Many questions should also be raised on various theoretical
        points. It is pointless to list them here. The main point is the
        experimental study leading to the confirmation or the refutation
        of a theory. It is not the blind respect of theory. </p>
      <p>I congratulate S. Goldfein for his report. Synthesis of physics
        and biology, such as the one he presented, are rate. There is
        here a wide filed for research which is not even being explored
        in most countries. Some aspects of the physics were left aside
        by the US Army scientists, weak energy interactions in
        particular. Few traditional physicists knew about the work of
        Weinberg and Salam before it was widely publicized after the
        Nobel Prize award at the end of 1979. S. Goldfein and his
        associates stated some synthetic considerations of the highest
        interest and their study is very encouraging. I have condensed
        too much the published report any my summary may be inaccurate,
        because incomplete. The subject is so vast that it is difficult
        to condense. Some American magazines presented summaries even
        more succinct than mine in order to prod the reader to refer to
        the original report. The reputation of the agency which issued
        the report is a guarantee that the study was done in earnest. My
        research reached renowned agencies throughout the world. Its
        value was confirmed by my nomination for the Nobel Prize by a
        scientist belonging to this internationally known agency. I
        started my presentation with the US Army study, because to my
        knowledge, it was the most detailed study published by an author
        and because the synthesis of physics and biology is most
        interesting despite the reservations made by theoreticians on
        some of its pints. The future alone will tell. </p>
      <p><b>(2) L. Romani’s Contribution ~</b> </p>
      <p>I must also discuss at some length a study made by the
        physicist L. Romani because it was not published insofar as I
        know. L. Romani is a well-known fluid mechanics specialist. He
        is known in particular for his remarkable contribution to the
        original, simple and efficient solution of specific technical
        problems in the field of wind energy (automatically controlled
        windmills) and of wind effect prevention (on suspended&nbsp;
        bridges, for example). He is the director of the Eiffel
        Laboratory, in which air flow studies are made for the purpose
        of improving aerodynamic shapes (aircrafts, automobiles, etc.).
        Eiffel’s laboratory facilities include a wind tunnel, which is
        used to check computations on scaled models. This work brought
        L. Romani to reexamine some aspects of acoustical waves and more
        generally of all waves. </p>
      <p>His keen understanding of energy problems related to air flow
        brought hi to study my work because of its implications in the
        field of energy. As soon as 1963, he proposed for it a purely
        physical examination which I presented in part in a book
        published in 1964. The validity of his calculations was accepted
        by two respected scientists mentioned in his paper. However, it
        seemed that the generalization of the phenomenon ran against
        some observations pointed to me by a well-known specialist of
        wave mechanics. For this reason I did not publish the remaining
        of Romani’s study in my subsequent publications. I did not even
        include the text published in 1964, as this study presented only
        a historical interest. </p>
      <p>However, Romani did not forget the matter. To this day he was
        not able to propose a global explanation of the process
        encompassing all the points established in my research.
        Nevertheless he showed that one should not forget particular
        fundamental points resulting from the study of wave phenomena if
        one does not want to become lost in farfetched theories. </p>
      <p>This respected physicist published a basic work in two volumes
        on his theories, <i>Theorie Generale de l’Univers Physical</i>...






        [blurred line in photocopy]... (A. Blanchard, Paris). He
        frequently used dimensional equations. As far as my work is
        concerned, one should refer mainly to partial studies, in
        particular to mimeographed copies of lectures he gave at the
        Sorbonne and in various other places mainly from 1976 to 1978. </p>
      <p>In November 1976, for example, he expounded various original
        points of view on energies at Cercle de Physique A. Dufour in
        relation to Relativity and energy transmission via the ether,
        which he still fully supports. He defended his position on this
        subject in multiple lectures. He accepts four types of energy,
        as everybody does today in a non-definitive and non-limitative
        way. He also stated the following: </p>
      <p>(1) The body on which the gravitational field is exerted, or
        mass, has the dimension of an inverse length&nbsp; L<sup>-1</sup>;
      </p>
      <p>(2) The body on which is exerted the weak nuclear field, or
        hypermass, has the dimension of a Gauss curvature L<sup>-2</sup>;
      </p>
      <p>(3) The body on which the electric field is exerted, or charge,
        has the same dimension as the ratio of a torsion by a curvature.
        It is a pseudo-scalar number; </p>
      <p>(4) The body on which the strong nuclear field is exerted has
        te same dimension as a torsion, L<sup>-1</sup>. </p>
      <p>One can see here some of the fundamental differences in the
        nature of the fields for the four types of energy. These lead us
        to express some reservations on some unified theories which can
        only unify everything in confusion or in a generalization devoid
        of precise meaning. </p>
      <p>I will come back to some of the differences in the main
        characteristics of the representative waves for these forms of
        energy, as they were outlined by L. Romani. I will only mention
        in passing various pertinent comments made by L. Romani, which
        are forgotten too often. According to him, photons are not waves
        but they are pairs of whirls. This concept leads him to original
        views which are far from being unanimously accepted by
        physicists. Waves do not carry energy; they carry information.
        Romani is far from admitting the classic definition of
        information as given by Brillouin and others. To consider
        information as the co-logarithm of entropy would be a mistake,
        as information cannot consume any energy. Otherwise the French
        language would not make sense anymore! But is it all that new?
        Blaise Pascal wrote: "I never argue about a name, provided I am
        told about the meaning which is given to it". Dialectic is still
        with us. A piece of information is a data, something abstract;
        it is something potential. It is only when the information is
        used that there is energy consumption. The whole entropy
        question should be reviewed, as it is generally agreed. In
        1977-1978, J. Tonnelat addressed this problem in a work in two
        volumes. He showed how poorly defined the problem was. This
        problem is extensively reconsidered in J. Tonnelat’s books. The
        reader will have a different view of the entropy (and
        negentropy) problem after reading them. "It is not right to
        consider entropy as energy, although both are dimensionally
        equivalent" (p. 158). One should also keep in mind some
        considerations which the author does not even mention. In
        particular, and I insist on this point, the problem of energy in
        living matter should not be looked at in the sole light of
        thermodynamics. Let’s not forget the action of neutrinos coming
        from the ambient medium (let’s say cosmic; let’s not be fooled
        by words) on the life phenomenon. This is an essential point for
        our work, as we will see later. </p>
      <p>Let’s come back to a remark by L. Romani: a wave only
        propagates a movement. The associated photon (electromagnetic
        energy) carries the information. In each point, at every instant
        the kinetic energy of the undulatory movement is derived from
        the potential of the Ether. There would be no energy transport
        by the waves of the local Ether. These waves are used as
        signals; they transport the information. Information initiates a
        similar movement in the receiver, which derives the necessary
        energy from the Ether and transforms this energy into kinetic
        energy, the only form of energy we can perceive. This is why a
        wave appears to carry energy. Romani’s Ether concept is new; it
        is the "tense" Ether. </p>
      <p><b>(a) Waves and Low Energy Transmutations ~</b> </p>
      <p>I will not summarize here L. Romani’s views on waves. He
        dedicated to them Ondes Inconnues (which was only mimeographed),
        a very dense work, too long to be summarized. However I will
        refer to it in the later part of this book, because Romani’s
        views on waves are too important to be ignored or forgotten. It
        is essential to keep them in mind in order to remember the
        fundamental differences between the various manifestations by
        other forms of energy fields. For the time being, I will only
        quote a few statements made by Romani: </p>
      <p>(1) Strong nuclear energy field waves are either centripetal or
        transversal and circularly polarized; </p>
      <p>(2) Weak nuclear field waves are longitudinal and circularly
        polarized. </p>
      <p>I emphasize that only circularly polarized energy forms, as
        defined by Romani, seem to be capable of producing element
        transmutations. This is a personal comment and it should not be
        attributed to Romani. I am only borrowing his wave
        classification, not the effects of the waves, which he did not
        mention. Wave effects were derived form my studies. I do not
        pretend to establish a general and absolute rule, valid for all
        transmutations, but only for the specific transmutations I was
        able to check. </p>
      <p>Gravitational waves (if there was such a thing) would be
        longitudinal and not polarized. </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic waves would be transversal with a rectilinear
        polarization. </p>
      <p>It is often said to simplify that "all simple displacements are
        either rotations or translations. Furthermore, a wave is either
        transversal or longitudinal". In short, it follows that: </p>
      <p>(1) Gravitational waves are longitudinal and not polarized; </p>
      <p>(2) Weak field waves are longitudinal and circularly polarized;
      </p>
      <p>(3) Electromagnetic waves are transverse and linearly polarized
        (in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation); </p>
      <p>(4) Strong field waves are transverse and circularly polarized.
      </p>
      <p>The first two longitudinal types can pass through shields, just
        like sound waves. </p>
      <p>In fact, undulatory phenomena are seldom simple. In the course
        of their propagation, waves may differ from the original forms
        in which they were emitted. Transverse waves may be linearly
        polarized in the plane perpendicular to the direction of
        propagation. Hybrid waves may occur such s waves polarized in a
        plane including the direction of propagation. Others are
        transverse and circularly polarized in the plane perpendicular
        to the direction of propagation. They could consist of the sum
        of two conjugated waves in quadrature. </p>
      <p>The wave question is complex and I cannot suggest any work
        covering the whole subject. The course by J. Bo and N.
        Hulin-Jong (Hermann), Ondes Electromagnetiques-Relativite,
        brings up interesting points of view, but it tackles only one
        type of wave and does not provide for any comparison, as it
        deals only with electromagnetic waves. These waves cannot cause
        weak energy transmutations, which are associated to waves of a
        completely different nature. </p>
      <p>I will come back later on specific ideas of Romani which I
        associated with some effects which he did not mention. These
        effects are in line with the additional information that Romani
        sent to me in May 1977 and that I discussed at the ARK-ALL
        inter-university meeting of June 1977. My paper was printed in <i>ARK-ALL





          Publication 1978</i>, Vol. 4 (1): 49-63. I will have the
        opportunity to come back later to some fundamental differences
        between weak energy fields and other types of fields, </p>
      <p><b>(2) Theory Proposed by Dubrov ~</b> </p>
      <p>In various letters, Alex. Dubrov, Dr in Science and Member of
        the Geophysics Institute of the Sciences Academy of Moscow,
        shared with me his ideas on the theoretical mechanism of
        biological transmutations. I will give here a brief summary of
        the information contained in The Geomagnetic Field and Life, a
        book he published in the USA in 1978. This was a corrected and
        much enlarged version of the book in Russian published in 1976.
        Dubrov sent me a copy of his initial book in Russian. </p>
      <p><i>The Geomagnetic Field and Life-Magnetobiology</i> is a big
        book published by Plenum Press, NY. It contains a bibliography
        of over 50 pages as well as 82 figures. In this work the author
        gives many experimental results related to electromagnetic
        effects of the earth on live matter. Some of the points studied
        were accepted by Prof G. Piccardi, formerly Director of Physics
        Laboratory of the University of Florence. I met Prof Piccardi
        several times and he sent me his book <i>The Chemical Basis of
          Medical Climatology</i>, published in the US in 1962 by C.C.
        Thomas, Springfield. He spent much time studying the effect of
        solar fields on the rate of precipitation of colloids, on human
        colloids, cells and blood in particular. He published <i>Biolelectric






          Rhythms in Human Blood</i> in Holland, 1970. </p>
      <p>Dubrov believes that geomagnetic effects are exerted at a very
        low level, even at a subatomic level, in the framework of the
        weak energy interactions. Geomagnetic field changes could
        reverse the spin of elementary particles, transforming a <b>[ 1
          sentence missing text ]</b>. In some cases they could cause
        dissymmetry by mirror effect (a 180 degree rotation). These
        molecular modifications in turn could alter the oscillatory
        rhythms in several parameters of the living organisms. The
        infractions to the symmetry law are important. They remain very
        much in the actuality, as attested by the 1980 Nobel Prize in
        Physics. This prize was awarded to a physicist who researched
        some specific infractions to the law of symmetry. His work was
        done some time ago, but the award shows how much interest the
        infractions to the law of symmetry still arouse. </p>
      <p>In 1980 Dubrov published another book in Russian on mirror
        symmetries. He sent it to me, but I do not know if it will be
        published in English. He advised me of the publication by
        Planum, NY in 1981. This new book will be co-authored by an
        America named Pushkin. In his book of 1978, Dubrov applies the
        geomagnetic field to biological transmutations, following the
        formulas I proposed several years before. He mentioned these
        formulae in his book of 1980. It seems that he did it from
        memory as he made some errors. </p>
      <p>He quoted some studies which show that magnetic fields of
        1,000-5,00 oersteds modify the amounts of dry material and ashes
        in plants as compared to seeds from which they originated. No
        minerals were brought from the outside during these studies. The
        same fields cause changes in oligo-elements according to these
        studies, which could only be explained by a transmutation of
        some elements. </p>
      <p>The cumulative effect of changes in the earth magnetic field,
        due to earth rotation, of proton showers and other factors,
        could produce structural inter-chromosome inversion by rotating
        one chromosome segment. In so doing it would modify the coding
        for the synthesis of enzymatic proteins. According to Dubrov,
        the genetic code would be based on a pentametric symmetry and
        the RNA triads would be arranged in an icosahedron. If these
        triads would be arranged in an icosahedron. If these triads were
        rotated by 180 degrees, alterations in residual amino acids
        could result. A change in the position of a single asymmetric
        atom is sufficient to modify the property of elementary
        particles which are becoming symmetric. In this fashion racemic
        tryptophan could be transformed into laevo-tryptophan. Let’s
        remember the importance of asymmetric carbon in organic
        chemistry. </p>
      <p>A magnetic spin reversal could be the initial cause of this
        transformation according to Dubrov. Elementary particles are
        very sensitive to variations in the parameters which involve
        weak energies. In this way there would be a correlation between
        macrocosm and microcosm. </p>
      <p>Geomagnetic field effects should be studied more closely in the
        light of the progress made I wave mechanics, communications,
        cosmology, and geophysics. They show tat there is no theoretical
        impossibility in accepting that some biological transmutation do
        not belong to the domain of strong interactions and that they
        can be explained by weak energy interactions. </p>
      <p>Dubrov’s study is most interesting because it emphasizes the
        mechanism ... <b>[missing page in text --- badly blurred
          photocopy]</b> </p>
      <p>According to Dubrov, there could be no significant interactions
        between neutrinos and living matter without actions by the
        enzymes, whatever the direct cosmic effects. As member of an
        agency affiliated to the University of Moscow, Dubrov focuses on
        a point worthy of additional studies. For the time being he
        shows mainly the directions which may lead to the explanation of
        the phenomena. He barely touched on their quantitative study. </p>
      <p><b>(4) A Few Interesting Points of View Expressed by Physicists
          ~</b> </p>
      <p>Various theories were proposed to explain the phenomenon of
        transmutation by living matter. </p>
      <p>The physicist Rene de Puymorin thought of a stationary wave
        mechanism similar to the sound mechanism. Based on the
        computation of several specific data, he concluded that
        electrostatic repulsion was wavelike and that it was not
        continuous or hyperbolic. He states its wavelength and from
        there his computations enable him to determine other aspects of
        the potential barrier. His study is primarily based on a
        specific concept of the electron structure. I am afraid of
        distorting his point of view in summarizing it too succinctly.
        The reader should refer directly to the work <i>L’Origine de la
          Gravitation</i>, published in 1975 by La Pensee Universelle,
        Paris. In this book R. de Puymorin expresses different views on
        various problems presented in a fairly simple and very personal
        way. It is food for thought. This small book of 64 pages is easy
        to understand. Puymorin discusses biological transmutations in
        11 pages only. He sent me several other more extensive studies
        which had never been published. I cannot refer the reader to
        them, and I have no room here to include the various notes
        puymorin sent me. </p>
      <p><b>(5) Costa de Beauregard’s Theory ~</b> </p>
      <p>As early as 1963 the physicist O. Costa de Beauregard saw the
        possibility of introducing the action of neutrinos in the
        reactions which I published in 1960. I noted this possibility in
        my book <i>Transmutations a Faibles Energies</i>, published by
        Maloine in 1964. C. de Beauregard said he was convinced that the
        energy balance in my reactions could only be understood though
        the effect of massless and chargeless particles. </p>
      <p>He immediately ruled out neutrinos, of which he thought first,
        because the conservation principles were not respected. Only 10
        years later could he formulate a theory satisfying these
        objections, at the time the neutral current theory was
        introduced. This theory constituted a major progress in the
        physics of elementary particles. </p>
      <p>This theory was summarized by the simple formula: <i>p</i> + <i>v</i>
        &gt;&gt; <i>p</i>’ + <i>v</i>’ , or: <sub>i</sub>N + p<sup>1</sup>&gt;&gt;







        <sup>p</sup>N’ + <i>v</i>’ . </p>
      <p>I had observed that such reactions were experimentally verified
        only for odd A nuclei and that they yielded modified even A
        nuclei with a <sup>1</sup>H<sup>1</sup> (or <sub>1</sub>p<sup>1</sup>)
        proton. At the time none of my experiments showed that it was
        possible to jump from an even A to the A of rank immediately
        superior. No experiment showed either that it was possible to go
        down scale from N <sup>+1</sup> to N by a single step. </p>
      <p>We had: p =/ <i>p</i>’ and <i>v</i> =/ <i>v</i>’ because the
        energy of the incident <i>p</i> proton was different from the
        energy of the <i>p</i>’ proton included in the nucleus. A
        neutrino of <i>v</i> energy was absorbed and a neutrino of <i>v</i>’
        energy was re-emitted. The energy difference was emitted into
        the ambient space without thermal effect or without any other
        effect on the material. This explained the energy balance
        observed. Such a formula satisfied the most rigorous
        conservation of energy, mass, impulse, angular momentum, spins,
        baryonic and leptonic numbers, etc. It could not be refuted with
        any theory. </p>
      <p>I will not give more details on de Beauregard’s theory. He
        presented it himself in the epilogue of my book, <i>Preuves en
          Biologie de Transmutations a Faible Energie</i> (Maloine,
        1975). In the last chapter I reported on our active
        correspondence during the time de Beauregard was working on his
        theory. The principles of this theory came to his mind in the
        spring of 1974 after the existence of neutral currents was
        confirmed. He asked me to insert it at the end of my book, which
        was then at the galleys for publication in 1975. </p>
      <p>A neutrino provided the necessary impulsion so that a proton
        can be included in an atomic nucleus by tunnel effect in
        accordance with quantum mechanics. This was the basis of de
        Beauregard’s theory. For example: </p>
      <p>V + K<sup>19</sup> + H<sup>1</sup> --&gt; Ca<sup>20</sup> + <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>
        ( with <i>v</i> =/ <i>v</i>’ ) </p>
      <p>The <i>v</i>’ neutrino is expelled in order to reestablish the
        energy balance between the two sides of the formula. The
        incident neutrino <i>v</i> provides the initial energy or the
        impulse which permits to introduce the H<sup>+</sup> into the
        nucleus of the potassium atom. </p>
      <p>Costa de Beauregard noted that his theory was only a
        preliminary framework and that it had to be completed. To this
        end a change in the transition natural possibilities under the
        effect of an information structure inherent in the life
        phenomenon, had to be considered, according to him. </p>
      <p>The theory still holds after 7 years if progress in the physics
        of elementary particles. As soon as 1976 I introduced various
        complementary concepts to enlarge and further document some
        theoretical physical aspects of the basic principle which was
        published in early 1975. These complements engage my sole
        responsibility. They cannot be attributed to de Beauregard I any
        way. </p>

      <p>As soon as 1975 I studied some complementary ideas which I
        thought necessary in order to enlarge the theoretical physics
        basis laid down by de Beauregard. </p>
      <p>Both of us lectured in London in 1975 in front of a large
        audience during the May Lectures and the morning after in front
        of specialists at the King’s College. </p>
      <p>These developments were the subject of various publications in
        French and English from 1976 through 1978, especially during the
        latter year. Different aspects of physics and progresses
        realized in this science since 1975 led us to define more
        precisely the initial concepts. I will briefly describe here the
        scope of our knowledge as of the beginning of 1981. Fundamental
        concepts are too often unknown of the physicists bogged in
        obsolete ideas. These concepts have been insufficiently
        publicized, unfortunately. This explains why these physicists
        are taking positions incompatible with the new science of the
        weak energies interactions. I can only discuss here a few
        fundamental points. </p>
      <p>An objection, still raised in 1980, is that the effective
        section of interaction between neutrinos and protons is too
        small to permit a weight change in the material. O. Costa de
        Beauregard had precluded this objection in his ending note to my
        book of 1975. At the time he based his concept of effective
        section only on classical theoretical considerations accepted by
        most physicists. </p>
      <p>Already in 1974 this notion was contested. It was based on the
        results of statistical evaluations which were too general,
        oversimplified, sometimes purely imagined and not confirmed by
        precise calculations. Incidentally, one did not know how to
        perform these calculations at the time. The question was more
        complicated than it was assumed at the time, and in a sense it
        was premature. The subject was discussed in lectures given
        during the 1974 summer session at Gif-sur-Yvette. In the June
        1974 of <i>Physics Today</i>, it was noted that the
        neutrino-hadron effective section did not have a fixed value and
        that it did not vary only with the energy of the incident
        neutrino. It was proportional to the square of the atomic mass
        of the nucleus. On other words, if the target was a K39 nucleus,
        then the square of this number should be introduced in the
        calculations. A considerable scale change resulted. A neutrino,
        which passes through a nucleus, comes close enough to all the
        nucleons in the atoms to react with each one. It is not absurd
        to conceive that the electrons other than the K orbit, revolve
        around the concentrated group of nuclei, when nuclei are very
        close to each other. This is the case in molecules, in which
        nuclei keep only around themselves the two electrons revolving
        on the K orbit. These electrons can even revolve in the
        interspace between nuclei. In this way there are many different
        orbits. Some organic molecules may have molecular masses
        reaching several tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
        The effect of an incident neutrino is felt by the whole nuclei
        cluster. </p>
      <p>Additional studies were going to support my ideas. In a 2-page
        paper published October 6, 1975, in <i>Physics Letters</i>
        entitled "Are Solar Neutrinos Detected by Living Things?",
        Ruderfer quoted the results of experiments performed on the
        giant calmar. He computed the effects of these neutrinos on
        mammal brains, as he had noticed that the sensitive part of a
        neuron (axons and dendrites) can amount to 100-1,000 times the
        volume of a body cell. This brings us to review the notion of
        capturing section, or more precisely, of effective interactive
        section. A 5-page study in English by Ruderfer, "Neutrino
        Structure of the Ether", published in <i>Lettre al Nuovo
          Cimento</i> (May 3, 1975), makes for an interesting read. So
        do other articles on neutrinos published by the same author in
        this periodical as well as in other American magazines. Some of
        these articles date back to 1968 and they deal with
        physiological and psychic points of view. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Isotopic Variations ~</b> </p>
      <p>I mentioned several times the wrong postulates accepted as
        classic by some physicists and phytobiologists. These errors are
        taught in schools of science, in schools of agronomy of high
        level, etc. Among these the invariance of the isotopic
        composition for a given element is most commonly accepted. </p>
      <p>I pointed out for example that photosynthesis is not a uniform
        phenomenon for all plants. His was a recall for some and a first
        for others. </p>
      <p>Isotopic variations explain the discrepancies in atomic mass
        between studied vegetal samples given by analysis. In my first
        book, published in 1962, I quoted discrepancies in the atomic
        mass of K measured with a mass spectrometer in potatoes. The
        mass varied according to the variety. These variations were not
        mentioned because they were attributed to errors in the
        laboratory procedure. Any other explanation could not be
        believed. </p>
      <p>Too many physicists and in their lead, phytobiologists,
        chemical physicists, medical doctors, agronomists and others,
        still ignored at this date these ideas seldom taught in school.
        For them, the isotopic composition is stable and the atomic mass
        is given in chemical tables. </p>
      <p>For how many physicists, even nuclear physicists, this axiom
        has become a taboo. Some told me, "Your reactions will only be
        accepted when you show that initial isotopes correspond
        quantitatively to final isotopes". To illustrate their point,
        according to them the increase in Ca in a plant must represent
        the sum of an atom of K and an atom of H, such that K<sup>39</sup>
        + H<sup>1</sup> &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>40</sup> or K<sup>41</sup> + H<sup>1</sup>
        &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>42</sup>. There is very little heavy hydrogen
        (deuterium) and it can be neglected usually. However it is not
        always the case. It is obvious that all the stable isotopes of
        Ca cannot be derived from the stable isotopes of K and H. I will
        state again that so far I never observed that Nature had to
        start from radioactive isotopes and that it could not produce
        radioactive elements. I do not pretend that it is not so and I
        insist on this point: I never observed it personally. Studies
        were made on this subject with extremely sensitive instruments,
        as at the French Centre d’Etudes Nucleaires in Saclay. Hence it
        was proved that the N<sup>15</sup> + O<sup>16</sup> &gt;&gt; P<sup>31</sup>
        reaction by microbial action could only be obtained from N<sup>15</sup>
        and O<sup>16</sup>, and that all other P isotopes would be
        unstable and radioactive. </p>
      <p>All radioactive isotopes found in living matter come from the
        outside, as it is the case in particular for C<sup>14</sup> and
        K<sup>40</sup>; furthermore they are found there in microscopic
        doses. A complete study of these cases must still be made as
        they occur during germination. I lacked the time and the
        financial resources required for such a study. </p>
      <p>Studies made on K and Ca isotopes show that the isotopic
        composition of a plant is different from the isotopic
        composition of a seed from which it originated. Photosynthesis
        should be kept in mind. We saw that it may vary according to the
        photosynthesis cycle specific to the vegetal family. This is why
        we can state that the people, who misinterpret the quantitative
        inequalities between isotopes in biological transmutations, make
        unwarranted generalizations. This should not be construed as a
        weak point in my observations, but only as the proof of their
        ignorance. </p>
      <p>One should also keeping mind what I stated in my earlier books
        and what I summarized in my book of 1975. All the Ca does not
        come from an agglomeration, from a fusion of K and H. there are
        other sources which vary according to the calcicole or calcifuge
        character of the plant. Specific species may need an alkaline,
        acid or neutral soil. A legume is not cultivated as rye grass or
        oats. Some plant families can transform manganese into iron. The
        reaction may be reversed in other plants and in other soils. The
        reaction is as follows: Mn<sup>55</sup> + H<sup>1</sup> &gt;&gt;
        Fe<sup>56</sup>. In animals the following reactions occur
        frequently Mg<sup>24</sup> + O<sup>16</sup> &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>40</sup>.
        The various stable isotopes of Mg and O correspond to stable Ca
        isotopes. Other stable Ca isotopes may lead to think that they
        come from stable silicon and carbon isotopes. I dedicated
        several chapters to these transmutations in my earlier books. I
        noted that in 1799 Vauquelin suspected such a correlation,
        although he did not mention it. Nuclear questions were unknown
        at the time. His chemical analyses showed an increase in Ca and
        a decrease in Si which were not quantitatively equivalent. He
        could not have thought of the K + H transmutation. I did not
        have the time to investigate the various potential origins of
        the Ca. Simplifications are out of the question and
        generalizations even more so. Naturally Vauquelin could not
        introduce isotopes in his comparisons, as the isotope concept
        was totally unknown at the time. </p>
      <p>I also showed the isotopic correlation Fe<sup>56</sup> - He<sup>4</sup>
        &gt;&gt; Cr<sup>52</sup> which is valid for the four stable
        isotopes of Fe and Cr. He<sup>4</sup> is the alpha particle. The
        correlation holds also to the few thousandths for the ratios
        between stable isotopes. I discussed this point in particular in
        my last two books. One should keep in mind this neutronic
        activation property. Its concept is completely ignored, even
        rejected with contempt, by many specialists. For them there are
        no differences in the compositions of live and dead matters.
        Life can only engage in chemistry, in which discipline nothing
        is lost and nothing is created. However, there is an
        indisputable variation during germination, as we showed in the
        first part of this book. We proved that the creation of Ca in
        oat after germination in a medium which could not receive any
        calcium from the outside. To compute the total Ca weight
        according to the isotopic ratio for a specific nucleus may seem
        to be a figment of the mind. However, one should not forget that
        the isotopic compositions given in the Atomic Mass Tables used
        in chemistry appeared to be so different from each other that it
        was necessary to define internationally the origin of the
        element selected as isotopic composition standard. Discrepancies
        are often greater than 1/1,000. In some cases they can be much
        greater, for the deuterium/light hydrogen ratio, for example,
        because the deuterium atomic mass is nearly the double of atomic
        mass of light hydrogen. In some reactions, decreases of up to
        70% in H were noted compared to the initial isotopic mixture.
        This is the phenomenon which allowed isotopic enrichments by
        separation of light and heavy isotopes. This separation can be
        obtained kinematically by diffusion through the appropriately
        calibrated hole of a porous membrane. There is no transmutation
        in this case, but obviously one should have some reservation
        regarding some methods used to track Ca or other elements, by
        neutronic activation for example. This does not mean that this
        technique should be absolutely rejected from the outset, but
        that the results must be cross-checked whenever the analysis is
        performed on living material. By neutronic activation the stable
        Ca48 becomes radioactive Ca <sup>49</sup> which is easily
        identified with accuracy. It seems that the ratios between these
        two Ca isotopes and the total Ca remains constant in the seeds
        as well as in the plants. It is therefore possible to use them
        to measure the total Ca. However, this does not explain the
        origin of Ca<sup>42</sup> in the total Ca in live materials. One
        should remember that there is only 0.18.1,000 (less than
        0.3/1,000) of Ca<sup>48</sup> in the standard. This extremely
        small concentration can only be marginally detected by many
        analytical techniques. This may be one reason why it is so
        difficult to trace the origin of this isotope. In oats its
        concentrations increase from the seed to the plant. Whatever
        happens, it is accepted that the Ca<sup>48</sup>/total Ca
        remains approximately constant. Total Ca variation is computed
        according to the variation in activated Ca. </p>
      <p>In this regard the director of a neutronic activation analysis
        laboratory wrote to me in February 1976: </p>
      <p>"We measure the Ca coming from the Ca<sup>48</sup> &gt;&gt; Ca<sup>47</sup>
        reaction. Therefore the activation analysis yields basically the
        amount of Ca. The total Ca is obtained by accepting (assuming)
        the natural distribution of isotopes". </p>
      <p>For many physicists this acceptance is still an act of faith at
        the present day. There can be exceptions, though this is not
        obvious, as I and many others before me could observe it.
        However results obtained by the neutronic activation technique
        should never be accepted blindly; they should always be
        cross-checked by chemical analysis (a gravimetric technique in
        particular). Sometimes I have another cross-check made by atomic
        absorption spectrophotometry (with a Beckman or Perkin-Elmer
        instrument). </p>
      <p>Macroscopically the question of the origin of the Ca isotope is
        unimportant, because this element represents only 2/1,000 of the
        total. However, I do not underestimate the theoretical
        importance it may represent and it is the reason why I discussed
        it here, so physicists would not forget, sometimes willfully, or
        would not ignore the biological causes of some physical
        phenomena, among them the isotopic selectivity of live
        materials. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Nature Operates at a Finer Level than Man ~</b> </p>
      <p>How much progress was achieved in chemistry in the last 100
        years! It is now to the point that chemistry invades everything,
        that all products on the market owe their existence to chemistry
        and very few products are natural anymore. Unfortunately there
        are people who do not understand that this ingestion of chemical
        products damages our bodies. </p>
      <p>People who are for the use of chemical products pretend that
        natural and synthetic chemical products of the same formula have
        the same effects on the human body. They state that their
        effects on our body are necessarily the same, because they
        cannot be discriminated a=from the chemical point of view, and
        for them al of Life phenomena are chemistry. </p>
      <p>It is their mistake. Chemical analysis is not enough to
        characterize a product. As a matter of fact, biochemists agree
        on this point now. They know that qualitatively and
        quantitatively identical atoms can be located in space in
        different ways, and that for this reason, resulting external
        electron envelopes may be different. </p>
