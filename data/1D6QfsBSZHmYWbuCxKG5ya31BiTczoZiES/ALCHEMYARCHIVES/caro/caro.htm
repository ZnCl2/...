        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preface ~</font></b> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a joy for me to give
            my testimony to the magnificent fulfillment of our great
            friend, Roger Caro.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Never was such an arduous
            task executed with so much patience, tenacity, sureness, and
            competence.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Puzzle constituted by 40
            loose color photographs, disordered and without caption, was
            solved and commented upon with mastery. This was a titanic
            undertaking, for to restore the correct order it was first
            necessary to learn the secrets of the Magistry --- at least
            in theory; for who wouldn’t be astounded by the superb
            result obtained when one has before one’s eyes Pleiade
            Alchimique, and above all the 508 quotations contained in
            Concordances Alchimiques, which places all the valid
            authors, both ancient and modern, in parallel, phase by
            phase, thus placing the Great Work in a favorable light.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of the preceding
            demonstrates a rare hermetic knowledge. Consequently, how
            would Our Order have been able to remain indifferent before
            such an unselfish work? So it is with one accord that our
            Supreme Council --- upon my request --- permits you to
            publish the Complete Great Work Photographed.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These photographs, which
            were formerly taken by our deceased and much-missed son,
            Kamala-Jnana, during the course of an alchemical experiment
            at Ajunta, could only be published by you, my dear Grand
            master. Also, do not stop yourself because of financial or
            other considerations. Go ahead, you have the faith, you have
            the knowledge, you know what must be done to succeed. Go
            then, and continued to sow the good seed. Don’t let yourself
            stop for anything, and remember always that God accords
            success only to his predestined --- the others, the
            complicated, will have eyes which don’t know how to see and
            ears which don’t know how to hear.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That these photographs and
            their commentaries touch as many of the chosen as possible
            is my most fraternal wish. Seekers can be delayed no longer,
            for you have said all, written all, and shown all.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">God bless you, my dear
            Grand Master. Our Order is proud of you.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">May Peace be upon you, in
            you, and around you.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction ~</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We will surprise no one by
            saying that a great number of seekers have asked us for the
            photographs which should illustrate the <i>Siphra Di
              Tzeniutha</i>. These 40 pictures, announced at the end of
            the <i>Dictionary of Alchemical Philosophy</i> by
            Kamala-Jnana, fascinate the adepts of the Great Art. Today,
            placed in chronological order, they are a true feast for the
            eyes of an Alchemist; a symphony of colors marking now the
            dry way of the Great Work, for what a job to regroup and
            methodically reorder this heap of scattered films, and give
            each of these a caption both valuable and audible to the
            Children of Light.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Well, all that is no more
            than the past, a dark past, with neither glory or fame; a
            past made of sleepless nights, or of sleep troubled by a
            thought always in perpetual motion. This past lasted from
            1961 to 1967 --- six years of researches and readings ---
            but in 9 months (thanks to our cards and notes) we had done
            all the spadework. Still, the light should illuminate the
            details only a great many months after, and progressively.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today everything is in
            order. A college of 20 adepts, under the chairmanship of the
            venerable Imperator of the FAR+C, has willingly given its
            unanimous consent to the appearance of the present work --
            certainly a modest one given its bulk and the number of its
            pages, but so great and weighty with information.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">May the Alchemical Temple
            of Ajunta see here our fraternal gratitude, for sincere
            seekers will find (thanks to this approbatur) a new source
            of information to master and in which to rejoice. What does
            it matter to us that a color plate (like those contained in
            the Dictionary) costs 75,000 old Francs altogether, and that
            there be 43 in the present work, since the hour is come to
            reveal that which is hidden.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This sovereign R+C
            missionary of 83 years (younger and more active than many
            young people) has said to us, "Go forward, do not let
            anything stop you". His wish is an old order. The Complete
            Great Work Photographed is off the presses. May heaven thus
            accord its graces to the future 250 possessors of these
            plates. That too is our dearest wish.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roger Caro</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">N.B. --- The present work
            is the last public alchemical contact connecting our present
            Imperator and the Sons of Science.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Number 1 ~</b> This is
            a laboratory-oratory corner of the Temple of Vrehappada
            (*1). Upon the stone table will be seen all that is
            indispensable to the Alchemists, and above all it will be
            observed that there is no Common Fire for two reasons:</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(a) because the
            reconstruction of the ore and the fabrication of the Salt
            have already been done;</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(b) because no
            transmutation is being done.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Outside of these two
            cases, Common Fire is proscribed.</font> </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="kj1a.gif" height="537" width="401"></p>
        </center>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Number 2 ~</b> The
            author executes the Separation of the three bodies using
            solely the salty Fire and the energetic Fire (2) It is in
            this that the three bodies obtained are similar but not
            identical to those sold in commerce. The former are living
            bodies, while the latter are dead, killed by the Common Fire
            of the furnaces.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Number 3 ~</b> This is
            the representation of an oak. No one can deny that, "sound"
            or "rotten", it be of a beautiful green, as Fulcanelli
            indicated: "The first magnetic agent before being used to
            make the Alkahest (*3) is called the Green Lion, not so much
            because it possesses a green color"... In effect, isn’t it
            the ash (of rotten oak, covered with moss, lichen, and
            saltpeter) which is most rich in Philosophical Salt
            [Potassium carbonate]?</font> </p>

            Thus placed to show clearly to the seeker the difference
            existing between the two products coming from the two
            methods of separation: Number 4 comes from a separation
            produces by a gas fire; Number 5 comes from a separation
            produced by the Natural Fire of the Salt and the Energetic
            Fire [grinding]. Number 4 is whitish, without life, whereas
            Number 5 is bright red, it lives, one feels that the fire
            has penetrated it, has pulled the marrow from it.</font> </p>

            Moreover, Nos. 6 and 7, which are the enlarged ends of each
            retort, show you in a perfect way the superposition (by
            density) of the two recovered liquids. Salt above, Mercury
            below; the Sulfur having remained with the impurities in the
            bottom of the retort for the reasons published by
            Kamala-Jnana in his <i>Dictionary of Alchemical Philosophy</i>,
            p. 37. We will not repeat it here.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Number 8 ~</b> This is
            a sample of the First Matter, a sample of this ore which
            contains in its breast the Sun and Moon of our Philosophers,
            as well as the Salt in an infinitesimal dose. Hermes,
            Paracelsus, Albert the Great, J.-B. Porta, etc., have called
            it cinnabar, either designating it overtly by its name or
            describing the method of making it artificially. Certain
            reader believed that the Master Kamala-Jnana refuted this
            ore categorically. This is not true at all; Kamala-Jnana
            simply said it should not be treated like the industrial
            ore. It is thus that it is analogous but not equal, similar
            but not identical. One can see the differences in
            photographs Number 4, 5, 6, and 7.</font> </p>

            instead of the citrine color (sometimes verging on dark
            chestnut) one obtains "suddenly" the appearance of Number 10
            (orange liquid), all should be redone. The flowers (of
            Sulfur) would be burned, as Synesius says. However, so that
            we be well understood, we specify that the color citrine
            (Number 9) is the starting color; after a few brief moments
            the color darkens very rapidly, which is a good sign.</font>

            These photographs form a pair. The Artist has cut off the
            Crow’s Head; that is, has removed the upper part which
            covers the black portion. From this moment, the flask will
            remain permanently open (save during the imbibitions).
            Moreover, the artist will let the collected liquid decant.
            When the blood is clarified, he will place it carefully into
            a hermetically sealed flask (as the liquid is very volatile)
            and will keep it sheltered from light and heat. It will be
            noted that the liquid, red when in a compact mass, becomes
            golden when spread out. This is the true tincture of Potable
            Gold, the Quintessence or Universal Medicine.</font> </p>

            photographs (taken by Master Kamala-Jnana) in order to
            properly show the phenomenon that is sometimes obtained
            during the course of the citrine color phase. Some small,
            salty crystals seem to spring up in the top of the neck of
            the flask. We use the expression "spring up" because in fact
            they spring up, grow, and lengthen day after day. A flask
            broken for demonstration shows the crystalline formation in
            the upper part of the flask, while the yellow granulations
            are seen very clearly at the bottom of the vessel (Number

        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here are the causes
            influencing the number of months of coction as indicated by
            the Philosophers: "Know that the blackness lasts 40 or 42
            days at least" (<i>Turba</i>).</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But the matter is
            sometimes fixed in more time and sometimes in less".
            (Synesius)</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We are shown that from
            green to white there are seven to nine months; from orange
            to red to four months; from yellow to orange three to four
            months"... ("The Zodiacal Life of Moses" in <i>Pleiades
              Alchemique</i>, p. 129)</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Why these possible
            alterations? Several factors are responsible: first of all,
            the quality of ore employed --- one lot will be more pure
            than another. If it contains a lot of impurities,
            purification will take longer.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The quality of the ash
            (more or less rich in potassium carbonate); that of the lime
            (more or less thirsty) (*7), the humidification of the Salt
            which can render it more or less active; finally and above
            all, our "wrong moves". It is these that are the principle
            causes of the variations in the time of the coctions. When
            they are not the causes of our failures. It is in these
            helping hands given at the opportune moment that Alchemy is
            truly revealed as an art.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This finesse of
            manipulation is not taught, it cannot be taught because the
            artist always works on an ore of different quality and in a
            changeable environment; it is quite evident that, ore for
            ore and material for material, the degree of temperature of
            the room also plays a great role; the Stone will be fixed
            more rapidly in summer or in a warm location than in winter
            or in a cold, wet place. Practice thus breaks away from
            theory. And it is exactly because so many essential factors
            escape seekers that we are able to affirm that only the
            predestined succeed.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Above all it should not be
            believed that we write to discourage the neophytes -- on the
            contrary, it is our aim to inform them-- and as the proverb
            says, "One forewarned man is worth two". How many true
            seekers (on the right track) fail exactly for not having
            thought of one of these causes. Also, to repeat the thought
            of Clemenceau cited by Ermeion and Nr. Palinga-Dhara in
            their "Explication of the Emerald Table" (p. 214 of <i>Alchemical



              Concordance</i>) (*8), we will say, "There are some people
            who know everything but understand nothing".</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Alchemy this thought
            could not be more true; that is why we sometimes say to
            disciples of Vrehappada&nbsp; to whom we are introduced,
            "The Temple (if you be worthy of it) will teach you the
            entire theory, down to the finest details -- but it will
            rest only with God to give you the practical, chemical
            success of the Great Work".</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is, moreover, in the
            light of this principle, "Many are called, but few are
            chosen", that we have not hesitated to publish the present
            work and the color plates representing the Magistry. (*9) We
            know that all our writings, all our publications will be
            understood only by those who know how to remain simple --
            and experience shows us, alas, there are not many who do.
            Let us hope fervently all the same that by hint of placing
            our friends on guard against the tendency to confuse and
            complicate everything, the chosen will be very numerous this

            Finally, we show the two elixirs: the red and the white.
            They are made from leaves of silver or gold rolled very thin
            and coming from the transmutations. They offer the
            appearance of the liquor called "Eau-de-Vie" of Dantzig,
            with its specks of gold in suspension; only the Elixir of
            the Alchemists contains a living metal and not a dead body.
            Personally, we are convinced that this liquor of Dantzig
            called "Eau-de-Vie" (and presenting the same appearance as
            the Elixir of the Sages) was most certainly the Solar Elixir
            presented by some Adept passing through the court of the
            King of Poland or Prussia. Since incapable (and for good
            reason!) of using the true and medicinal gold of the Adepts,
            Dantzig has continued by tradition to manufacture an
            "Eau-de-Vie", but with gold from the mines. In any case, if
            this liquor is not the Elixir of the Sages, it is no less
            flavorful to taste.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Pleiade Alchimique</i>
            and <i>Concordances Alchimiques</i> have given the theory
            in plain language; the present document will guide the
            seeker in the practice and will keep him from all false
            steps if he keeps strictly to the teaching given.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The one who is Amen, the
            faithful and true witness, the beginning of the ‘works of
            God’ advises the angel of the church of Laodicea ‘to buy an
            eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see" (Rev. 3: 4,
            18). You now have this eyesalve, and know that the way which
            is indicated to you is the only one which should be
            followed, the one which has remained unchanged since Hermes.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Amen is a Hebrew word
            which signifies that which is true and certain. As our Lord
            is Amen, the Truth and the Life, what is more certain
            guarantee of the truth and authenticity of the document
            presented here could be given you than the seal appended to
            the end of the Preface by our venerable Imperator, A.J.
            D’Ossa. The present Postscript completes the circuit begun
            by him at the beginning of the work, and that is why our
            feeling is strong in evoking this image of the Oroboros
            which resumes periodically the complete Magistry and which
            reunites us with the one of whom we revere the great Wisdom
            and immense spirit of charity which make of him a second St.
            Vincent de Paul. Alone, our brothers who suffer and the
            ill-favored know him, and they know him well.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In your labors, seek not
            to avoid the planned areas of rest or they will be condemned
            irrevocably to failure. The Sacerdotal Way is reserved for a
            very few of the Chosen. But when you will have understood
            the theory completely and all the operational phases while
            be known to you in all their detail, when you know all, be
            conscious of two other truths: Think not that with the sum
            of knowledge you will have acquired success that will
            obligatorily crown your labors. Indeed, we have spoken at
            the beginning of the Art of Alchemy. Alchemy is very much an
            Art, and a difficult Art which demands dexterity, attentive
            care and patience. The realization of the Magistry is the
            function of numerous parameters that cannot be defined in a
            book. Our Grand Master Roger Caro has, for example,
            explained to you the reasons for which the total duration of
            28 Philosophical Months can vary to a greater or lesser
            extent. It is necessary to add here that one of the
            fundamental conditions of success is the respect for the
            seasons in the method of increasing the fires for the
            different coctions, as well as the adaptation of the
            theoretical proportions of the three constituents of the
            mixture to the degree of actual purity of each.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, since the present
            work treats only of the practice of the Art, when you will
            have acquired the capacity which can allow you to hope to
            hold in your hands the perfect red Stone, don’t forget that
            Our Father alone accords this privilege to his Chosen, to
            those who practice the virtues that St. John develops in
            Chapters 2 and 3 of <i>Revelations</i>; dogged work, John
            develops in Chapters 2 and 3 of <i>Revelations</i>: dogged
            work, perseverance, and above all purity, the spirit of
            Charity, poverty, and assistance to the poor. Therefore,
            "The one who will be victorious will possess these things
            and I will be his God and he will be my Son" (Rev., 21:
            5-7). With all our heart we say to you: Be worthy, Son of
            Our Father, by your Faith, your Purity, and your Charity.</font>
