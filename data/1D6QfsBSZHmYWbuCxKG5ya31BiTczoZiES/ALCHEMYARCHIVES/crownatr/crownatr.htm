      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The influence of the heavens by the will and
        command of God, descends from above and mixes with the virtues
        and properties of the Stars, and likewise in this manner is the
        first production of our seed. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not take it out of any combustible
        for it fights with it without being prejudiced, but is known out
        of a metallic root ordained by the Creator only for the
        generation of metals. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must seek it in the seed of its proper
        nature from which nature may produce it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernard Trevisan's books are writ true,
        right and once by circumstances to amuse souls. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elements are Water, Air, Earth, and
        Fire, which must be so applied and governed until such time they
        produce a soul. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We gather the four elements by a concordance
        of the Seven Planets. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All our work is to Congeal and Dissolve the
        body, and Congeal the Spirit. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God being before all things, when He was
        alone created one Substance, which He called the first matter
        and of that substance he created the Elements, and from them
        created all things. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Stone is the Quintessence of the Four
        Elements, separated from them and reduced into a fifth Essence,
        being extracted out of the body of the first matter. Nature
        created by God prepared with human artifice, then by the
        Conjunction and Union of the said elements after their perfect
        rectification, reduces them into a fifth, a glorious fifth
        Essence or Spirit called Quintessence, appearing in a glorified
        body which is found in one only thing created by God. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheresoever is found a metallic Spirit, a
        metallic Soul and a body metallic, there is also found
        infallibly Quicksilver, Sulphur and Salt, in which certainly
        will make a perfect metallic body. <br>
        We gather it from the most perfect Creature upon which the Sun
        ever set his eyes. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St Dunstan's work, <i>De Occulta
          Philosophia E: G: I: A</i>, calls it the food of Angels, the
        heavenly Viaticum, the Bread of Life, and it is undoubtedly next
        under God, the true Alchochodon or giver of years, and he does
        not so much admire the question whether any man can die that
        uses it, as to think why the possessors of it should desire to
        live, who have these manifestations of Glory and eternity
        represented to their fleshly eyes. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Stone is made or composed of Two, Three,
        Four, and Fire: of Five, that is the quintessence, of Four which
        are the Four Elements, of Three which is of three Principle
        natural things, of Two which signifies double mercury, and of
        One which is the first principle of all things, which was
        produced clean and pure from the Creation of the world, fiat ---
        be it made. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are Creatures created more noble than
        Gold and we must look [for] it where truth will find it, which
        so hath put in nature, and man cannot know it by sight, except
        he see the whole work. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam our first father was in his inward
        parts, or internal man, made according to the similitude of God
        of the same substance and matter which the Angels were made,
        though men (that the world hold great Doctors) say and tell it
        for truth that God made man out of a piece of mud, clay, or dust
        of the Earth, which is false, it was no such matter, but a
        quintessential Matter, which is called Earth but is no earth.
        Adam before his all had a far different body than what he had
        after, and so far different that if we should behold him as he
        was in his Innocency, we should admire the glory of him, and
        tremble at the sight, as at the sight of an Angel and such a
        body as our blessed Saviour brought from heaven with him, such a
        body shall we arise with, and with such bodies shall our souls
        be endued with flesh and blood. Otherwise Man would not differ
        from Angels, for this flesh and blood is put upon us by the Holy
        Ghost, that is by regeneration. I forebear to speak more of
        these mysteries known to few. But he that liveth to be blessed
        with this Art, shall glorify his Creator. Man the Microcosm or
        Little World, from the Stars received Spirit, from the Great
        World his body, and from God immediately his soul, so here is an
        illumination of the Blessed Trinity. Now let us say something of
        the production of the Great World out of nothing, when there
        were neither time or place, and God created a certain Chaos
        Invisible which the Philosophers call Hyle, the most remote
        matter. Out of this He made an extract or Second Matter Chaos,
        which the Philosophers know not by speculation, but since that
        matter was and is visible and tangible, in which were and are
        all the seeds and forms of all creatures Superior and Inferior,
        that ever were made. From this God divided the four Elements, in
        a word did make all things Celestial and Terrestrial, the
        Angels, Sun, Moon, and Stars. The knowledge and practice of the
        Philosophers upon this Chaos brought them to the knowledge of
        all wisdom, and from thence next [to] God, seek thou and find
        all wisdom, and indeed Angelical wisdom is attained by it. <br>
        Incredulity is given to the world as a punishment. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He that knoweth not what he seeketh, shall
        not know what he shall find. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Concerning the Ancient Chaos</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaos is the first beginning of the first
        created from an Uncreated Being, this God omnipotent created in
        the beginning, but before the work of the days it was without
        shape and also confused. But afterwards all the most sound
        Philosophers nominated that Essence, the Mother and the first
        matter of the world, for Hilon, and Nature, in whose bosom
        innumerable forms lay hid, which the Omnipotent Builder, that
        great Spagirus, appointed in his time to break forth, for he had
        first included a spirit in that Undigested Matter, Chaos, who
        some hath affirmed ought to be called the Soul of the World,
        some the Form of Forms, others the Proximate Instrument of the
        Creator. By the benefit of this spirit so included, there is at
        length by the most free will of God, providing for and
        overlooking all things, a separation is made of the waters from
        the waters, by which they were divided. But it is very
        remarkable, that at the separation of the Chaos, there was a
        just division, no deperdition, but every particle of the same
        being full of spirit and life, they are fit for that to which
        they were ordained, waxing strong and vegetating. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the admirable strength of things, may
        by the sons of men be drawn forth and become a true
        metamorphosis, if they artificially search and handle them
        according to the nature of the Chemical Art, for the true
        Philosophers have considered of no other Mystery than Nature
        itself, and a possibility of Nature, which Natural simplicity
        may indeed suffice those that rely on it, for Nature doth work
        most of all from its aptness of its own virtue and beginning, as
        it doth demonstrate, only needing a little help of Art. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Cabalists this Chaos is twofold, to
        wit, Intelligibles and Visibles, the one proceeding from the
        immediate decree of God, the other is reported or declared to
        proceed immediately from the execution of the same decree. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know further, that the point you see in the
        White, is put for the centre of the Earth, the whiteness doth
        signify the Earth itself, the crooked line signifies the flowing
        water, which in its own place would cover the Earth, but by the
        decree of the most bountiful Creator, it encompasses some part
        only. The white circle beset with little black spots, signifies
        the Air, as the sevenfold little points of a golden color
        denotes the Fire. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things being thus expounded and
        declared, the next consideration shall be of the seven Planets
        punctually compassing the Chaos. The first of these is Saturn,
        and therefore is placed in the ascendant, but he contains all
        the other planets, as the others do the rest, but in a diverse
        order. From hence it is known that all things are in all things,
        according to the true philosophical intention. But Saturn
        himself is feminine and melancholy, Jupiter feminine and
        phlegmatic and sanguine, Mars masculine and sanguine, Mercury
        feminine and phlegmatic, lastly the Moon feminine and
        melancholy. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Saturn the Chemical Subject in the Root of
              Art</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturn is the first of the planets far
        exceeding all his brethren in essence, order and dignity. He is
        accounted the primary son of Nature, the root of metals known to
        few. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence saith the <i>Clangor</i>, the
        colouring spirit is the philosopher's Mercury with its Red or
        White Sulphur being naturally mixed with it in the mine and
        bowels of the Earth, also indifferently prepared, the judgement
        of the artificer being left until the perfect consummation, as
        it is in the metaphor of Bellinus concerning the Sun, that which
        is the spirit is called Saturn, in plain words tincturing and
        dividing all metallic bodies especially gold with a true and
        radical dissolution, as is manifest by his words in the <i>Rosary,</i>
        "Know, saith he, that my father the Sun hath given me power
        above all power and hath clothed me with a garment of glory, and
        all the world seeks me and runs after me, for I am that
        excellent one who exalts and debases all things, and none of my
        servants except one can overcome me, to whom is given that which
        is contrary to me, and he destroys me, though not my nature, and
        that is Saturn who separates all my members. Afterwards I turn
        to my Mother who congregates all my divided and separated
        members". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trevisan affirms the same thing, that no
        other argent vive can be extracted out of any other body, except
        out of the Red Servant, which is called by Bellinus, the
        contrary Servant. But it is called a Servant (to wit) the
        Servant of Nature, because it serves in the generation of Metals
        in her Minerals, and because it serves in Chemistry to generate
        that heavenly and also specified stone. It is called Red,
        because in this last preparation he goes into red dust. But it
        is termed to be contrary to the Sun, because he doth radically
        dissolve him and bring him into his first matter. But lest thou
        should err, my Son, these things are not to be understood of
        Saturn belonging to metals or mineral Mercury, but concerning
        the metalline Sun and Moon which are contained in our lead, (to
        wit) in potential and not visible. Pythagoras says that every
        secret is in lead. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may at length conclude in one word
        this golden chapter, I do plainly with a constant protestation
        affirm the more sound Philosophers to have nominated it the Star
        of the Sun, the Ens of the Moon (Sun and Mercury). Know further,
        that although the subject of health and riches be the same, and
        that we will handle them both in these commentaries, yet
        professedly as to the sons of learning and men of understanding
        it may appear in this place, we will especially treat of the
        matter of Medicine, for it is our chief intention. But as yet
        you see Saturn in the ascendant, and all the planets
        accompanying him, but having the Sun and Moon under his feet, by
        which is signified that Saturn himself only doth contain in
        himself those two tinctures, sought by so many and found or
        known to few. But that a little solar star appears in the Moon,
        and a little lunar star in the Sun, doth not want a Mystery, for
        the Sun and Moon came forth of the one and same root, as may in
        a short space be occularly demonstrated by an ingenious
        Artificer, by the little white drops which afterwards become red
        is signified abundance of Tincture, lying hid especially in the
        body of Saturn. By the mountain out of which a flourishing tree
        doth appear, is very fitly signified that Saturn is not gotten
        elsewhere than in hilly places. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Distillation</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the subject was known, the first
        intention of the philosophers that water should be got which
        they had noted with many names amongst which that sharp vinegar
        so much spoken of by them is one. But the second is dissolving
        Mercury. The third is Marish water. Dissolving Mercury is
        defined by a natural dissolution, and is defined by them to be
        that by whence metals are dissolved by a natural dissolution,
        and their spirits are brought from power into Action. But before
        they can be brought to act, Nature ought necessarily to be
        stirred up, but if the dissolving Mercury should be dry there
        would be no irritation of Nature, and so by consequence in vain
        would the solution be hoped for. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are therefore some which have
        endeavoured to have that dissolving Mercury, or this water of
        those marshes, by Distillation, and it was effected. Therefore
        Distillation with them is the elevation of the watery vapours in
        the vessel, for in that are two parts of the Stone (to wit), the
        Superior and the Inferior. They will have the Superior part to
        be attenuated by Distillation, especially again when the Earth
        drieth and fasteneth, the Water makes clean and washeth, but the
        Air and Fire maketh to color. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnoldus says, it is necessary that there be
        much Water and much Air, because the multitude of the tincture
        will be so much as the multitude of the Air, but the Water is
        purging and the efficient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause of the
        clearness of the whole body and Medicine. Hence it is that
        frequent Distillation is called the most true Ablution of the
        Elements. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore necessary that the Stone be
        divided by the Four Elements and that by Distillation. First, by
        a light fire equally temperated and continued, water is to be
        gotten. Then the fire is to be made a little more vigorous and
        stronger, until the fire be received mixed with the fire. That
        which remains burned in the bottom is the dry earth where the
        crystalline Salt of the Stone lieth hid. Moreover, by the
        inferior circle, the furnace is signified. By that Red as yet
        beneath, the fire is signified. By the superior circle, the
        vessel in which the matter is put. By the cloud is signified the
        smoke which seems to rise like a cloud as you are distilling. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Preparation</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare in this art is nothing else than
        to take away superfluities and supply deficiencies, because
        light things cannot be fixed without the company of weighty, and
        weighty things cannot be exalted without the consortship of
        light things. Neither can the hot without the consortship of the
        cold, the cold of the hot, the moist of the dry, the dry of the
        moist, the hard of the soft, the soft without the addition of
        the hard, be temporated or prepared. But when they are by course
        fitly espoused, there is generated from them a temporated
        substance, which the violence of the Fire cannot overcome, nor
        the putrefaction of the Earth vitiate, neither the limosity of
        the Water condensate, nor any contract, adumbrate, or
        overshadow. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must know further that the preparation of
        the aforesaid matter is perfected by the removing of the
        superfIuous part and the addition of the absent, by the exercise
        of the Four Regimens. The first of them is a reduction to the
        nature of the Fire. The second is a resolution into Water, and
        the third is a levigation into Air, and the fourth is a pressing
        down to the Earth or fixing. The first is by Calcining. The
        second is by Loosening. The third is by distilling through a
        still. The fourth is by Coagulating or Congealing with a light
        fire. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the whole preparation is perfected,
        to which purpose the Hermite did also intimate in his Smaragdine
        Table, saying, "it ascends from the Earth to Heaven and descends
        again from Heaven to Earth". And that this doctrine concerning
        the preparation of the Stone might be better understood, Geber
        testifieth most openly concerning this. Saith he, "Our art doth
        not consist in the plurality of things for it is one matter (to
        wit) of metals in which consisteth our Mystery, to which we have
        not added any strange thing, neither do we diminish unless that
        in the preparation we remove superfluity". But the other things
        pertaining to this Chaos are clearly enough unfolded by the
        second Chapter, but here it remaineth in the Water. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Division</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division in this art is the separation of
        the parts of the composition that they may be the better at
        length united. In which sense composition is contrary to
        Division, which indeed is the beginning and life of the thing,
        for unless there were a Composition, the thing would not be
        produced into a being. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the cunning Son of Jazichus, the
        spirit will not remain in the body, neither will it be in it nor
        tarry any longer, until the body be subtilated, attenuated as
        the Spirit is. And when it is so attenuated and subtilated and
        does go out of his density and thickness to thinness, and from
        his grossness and corporeality to spirituality, then the spirit
        will be mingled with and drunk up in them, and so they are both
        become one and the same and will not be separated, as neither
        water mixed with water cannot be discerned, so although the
        Philosopher's Stone be divided into two principles (to wit) into
        the superior part which ascendeth, and into the inferior part
        which remaineth in bottom fixed, yet notwithstanding these two
        parts doth concord in virtue. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the materials are to be weighed
        and converted and divided because they are changed from a thing
        into a thing, as the seed of a man in the womb is in a natural
        preparation turned from thing to thing, until there be found a
        perfect man, from which was his root and beginning. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, by the Solar and Lunar stars is
        signified the water already gotten out of the body of Saturn. By
        the Sun and Moon the body of Saturn wherein the Salt yet
        remaineth. By the red understand the fire, by mediation whereof
        the aforesaid water was drawn forth. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acuation is that by which the Stone is
        amended by the extraction of his proper earth, that is of the
        Salt, and by the mixing of the same with Sulphur and his proper
        Mercury. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Gratianus, of every thing there may be
        made ashes, and of that Salt there is water, and of that water
        there is Mercury, and of that Mercury by diverse operations
        there is made Sun. He therefore that knows the Salt and its
        solution, knows the hidden secrets of the ancient wise men.
        Whosoever, therefore will alter spirits and bodies and change
        them from their nature, it behoveth that he first reduce them to
        the nature of Salts and Alums otherwise he will do nothing, then
        let him lave or wash those, that Sal may go forth fusible. You
        ought as Arnold saith to praise God, from whence also another
        Philosopher, put therefore thy mind on the Salt, the chief and
        most hidden Mystery of all the ancient Philosophers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, by the lunar star is signified the
        White Salt of Saturn already gotten. By the circles, the furnace
        and vessels. By the compassing red, the fire, and that of
        Calcination, because Saturn is not gotten but first by
        calcining. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Green Lion is that Philosophical Mercury
        so often spoken of in his first beginning, or flourishing,
        easily avoiding the fire, because it is not fixed, but being
        fixed it desires it, and expects it and rejoiceth in it. It is
        of a Cold and Airy nature, and out of it (as it is in the <i>Rosary</i>),


        God created all mines. Let it not therefore seem strange to
        anyone because it reduceth into and doth radically dissolve all
        metals into their first matter, when as out of him are all
        things, and in whose bosom are all the planets, they lie hid and
        are contained. Seeing therefore that some of them affecteth a
        sublime work to him and is a profitable spirit, and there is no
        thing in the world besides him, neither is there that may stand
        in his place, and is only profusive in the body that wants him
        (hence Rosary). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the ancient and wise Philosophers have
        engendered the manner of wit (knowing) until it be a little done
        that he might expect the fire. It doth not cease to go above the
        reluctancy of the fire and is nourished with it, so that when
        any fixation is fastened unto him, there proceeds wonderful
        things and changes, because when he is changed he changeth, and
        his entrance appears in his sound and splendour. When therefore
        it is coloured it coloureth, when it is loosed it looseth, and
        it doth make itself white in the twinkling of an eye, and it
        becomes red in succession, and it is a congregating water, milk,
        and strong urine, softening oil, and the father of all wonderful
        things. It is smoke and a cloud, and the fugitive servant
        accidental Mercury eating the Sun, who hath preferred himself
        before Gold and hath overcome, for it is generated, risen and
        produced out of him. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But lest thou should err, my son, know that
        those which understood of Mercury in the body of Philosophical
        Saturn and metalline, to be true. Moreover the Lion is said to
        be green in the threefold aspect. First in respect of his
        attractive power, for here the Central Sun is like to the
        Celestial Sun and make the world flourishing and green.
        Secondly, it is called the green Lion, because as yet the Gold
        is incomplete nor fixed in any body, and therefore is called
        living Gold. Thirdly, it is called a Lion by reason of its very
        great strength, reference being had to the Animal Lion, for as
        all beasts obey the lion, so all metallic bodies do give place
        to this living Gold. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjunction in this art is a natural act of
        two vapours of the body and spirit, in one and the same genus
        but in a diverse species of actors and sufferers [actives and
        passives]. <br>
        But lest thou should err, my Son, thou must now that the spirit
        is twofold (to wit) Tinctural and Preparing. The Preparing
        spirit dissolveth brass and extracteth it out of the body of the
        lodestone, and reduceth it again into the body itself. But the
        Tinctural spirit is beyond the body, and it is a body itself of
        a watery nature, but in the Elixir the tinctural spirit being
        masculine is the body, the woman the spirit. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence saith Arnold, the spirit is not
        altered from the body so that it should lose its spiritual
        virtue, but every body is altered and coloured by the spirit.
        Join therefore, my Son, (as it is in the Rosary thy Gabricius
        more beloved to thee than all thy sons, with his sister Beya,
        who is a cold girl, sweet and tender. Hence it is rightly
        gathered, that unless there should be such a copulation, there
        would never be a Conception, Raising, Pregnation, or Birth. This
        therefore, is the direction of this disposition, which is
        especially assimilated to the creation of Man. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by the circles is signified the vessels
        and furnace. By the Green Lion as it were but half into the
        vessel, is signified that one part ought to be put in after
        another and not altogether, as first Mercury then Salt or Oil,
        and these things are to be put in by little and little, after
        they are purified. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find the Philosophers Stone to be
        variously defined with Philosophers in general, amongst which
        definitions we will at length rehearse one or other of them. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the Stone, as Clangor hath it, is
        a body composed out of the first essence of metals, which first
        essence is indeed termed other where Argentvive reduced from the
        power of them into acting by the art of chemistry, the mystery
        of all beginnings. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the Philosopher's Stone is metallic
        matter converting the substance and forms of imperfect metals.
        That this conversion is not done but by its like is long ago
        agreed upon by all Philosophers. It is therefore necessary that
        the Stone be got out of a metallic matter (to wit) our Mercury
        in which is all that which is so sought for by the wise men, and
        lieth hid in our Mercury, although this Mercury may be termed
        threefold. From whence three principle Stones are known by
        philosophers, (to wit) the Mineral of the Wise men, or the
        Mineral, Animal, and Vegetable Stone of them, threefold in name,
        one in being. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon saith one of the Ancients, there
        are three Stones and three Salts of which the whole magistery
        consisteth, (to wit) Mineral, Animal, and Vegetable (Mercury is
        mineral; the Moon is plant, because she receiveth into herself
        two colours, white and red ; and the Sun is animal because he
        receiveth three, (to wit) constriction, white and red). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by the tree upon the mountain on the
        left hand flourishing and bearing fruit, is signified his
        vegetability, as by the leg of a man raised out, his animality.
        By the third mountain upon which also a flourishing tree grows
        out, two things are signified. First, that Saturn is hid only in
        hilly places and it behoveth that he should be digged out of the
        Earth, which may be understood to be noted by the circle, from
        whence especially his minerality appears. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Calcination</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calcination, as subtle witted Geber will, is
        the turning of a thing into dust by the fire, and by the
        privation of its humidity, consolidating other parts. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to others, this Calcination is the
        last purgation of the Stone, the restoring of its colour, the
        conserving of its innate Humour, and the induction of Solution.
        And it is fourfold, for it is either by the desiccation of the
        moistness of Nature, or by reduction into the bottom of the
        furnace by fire, and then it is called Alcoole or a subtle
        powder, or by the amalgamation of familiar metals with
        quicksilver, by mixing metals with six parts of Mercury, or by
        strong waters, the spirits of the Salts of black vitriol, of
        sulphur and the like. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However it be, we use Calcination to mundify
        the part fixed, and the Earthly part of the Stone. For every
        calcined thing is in its kind fixed. And so the Sun and Moon are
        calcined with the first water philosophically, that the bodies
        may be opened and become spongeous and subtle, that the second
        water may the better go in to work its work, which is to exalt
        the Earth into Mirable Salt by its only attractive virtue. Which
        second water is fire, not natural, by whose virtue the
        completement of this art is done. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, by the Sun here joined with the
        Moon, understand the body of Saturn even now to be calcined with
        the Philosophical water. By the bird flying from above, that in
        Calcination the spirit of Saturn goes downwards and remains
        together with the body, as in Sublimation it always goes upward,
        as is to be seen in the next chapter. But by the bird or spirit
        flying upwards, understand dusky clouds ascending frequent
        indeed but moderately. </p>

        stirred up and doth subsist there. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Geber, it is the elevation of a
        dry thing by the fire, with the adherency of its vessel. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either definition is honest. We must know
        further, that the philosophers for four reasons made
        sublimation. First, that the body should be made a spirit of a
        subtle matter. Secondly, that the Mercury might incorporate
        itself with the body and become one with it. And thirdly, that
        the whole may become White, then Red and clean, and especially
        that the innate humidity of the Stone might be restored, which
        he had at the first lost in the bottom, and may be moved
        forwards and made fit for a sudden liquefaction, because the
        medicine ought to be a simple dust of a most subtle and pure
        substance, adhering out of its nature to the Argent vive or a
        most easy liquefaction, and hidden or secret subtilation of an
        easy ingression, after the manner of water, and fixed on the
        reluctancy of the fire, before the fIight of Mercury. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Solution is the reduction of a dry
        thing into water. By this Solution metallic bodies are reduced
        into their first form, that is into their next matter, to wit,
        Mercury and Sulphur from whence they took their beginning. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the Philosophers do put the matter
        of Solution to be twofold, to wit, by hot mud and fervent water,
        but others do contend that there is but only one Solution
        necessary in this art, which only hath and is to be done out of
        and with itself, and it is raw and clear without violence. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence saith the Philosopher --- a raw
        solution is better than a sodden one, a moist than a dry, a
        voluntary than a violent, a temperate than a swift, a fragrant
        than a stinking, a clean one than a thick, a black one than a
        red one, and therefore in every Solution we must secretly beware
        of the vitrification of the matter by the odours and vapours of
        imperfect bodies, that the force of that generative form may not
        be choked up with corrosives. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, saith the Philosopher "help

        <p><b><font size="+1">Putrefaction</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putrefaction according to some is the
        resolution of that which is mingled into the hot and moist by a
        natural putrefaction. According to others, Putrefaction, which
        is also termed conception or espousing in the putrefaction which
        is in the bottom of the glass, is the Conception of the proper
        and natural callidity in every moisture, under the conservation
        of it from another moisture going about in the glass. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet notwithstanding, Putrefaction is
        necessary in this work because there is never anything born,
        increasing, nor animated, except after Putrefaction because if
        it were not putrefied, it could not be poured forth nor loosed,
        and if it were not loosed, it will be brought to nothing. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou must know this, My Son, that the
        Putrefaction of the Philosophers is not sordid nor unclean, but
        it is a mixing of the water with the Earth, and the Earth with
        the water, by little and little, until the whole body is become
        one. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Morien "in the Putrefaction of our
        brass, the spirits are united with the body and are dried up in
        it. For unless the water should be dried up with or by the
        Earth, the colours would not appear". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Putrefaction is nothing else but a
        mortification of the moist with the dry, between whose
        mortification there doth appear blackness in regard of the
        domination of the obscure woman. <br>
        Yet the process or force of itself, to wit, of the Philosopher's
        Stone, is first Black, because unless it were first Black it
        would not be White, nor Red, because that redness is composed of
        Black and White. The Philosophers have called this blackness,
        Silver, the black Lead, the head of the Crow, and from whence it
        is said in <i>Turba</i>, "when thou shalt see blackness to come
        to that water, know then the body is melted". </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must know, my Son, that whilst the
        Earth in the aforesaid blackness doth begin to retain with it
        some of the Argent vive, then it is termed Conception, and then
        the male acteth towards the female, to wit, Argent vive, with or
        into the Earth, and this is the reason why the Philosophers say
        that our Mystery is nothing else but the male and female and
        their conjunction. For the water beareth sway over the Argent
        vive, and the Earth increaseth, multiplieth, and augmenteth. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence again Philosophers say, "Conception
        and Dispousation are to digest it in the putrefaction in the
        bottom of the vessel, and the generation of the genitors in the
        air and head of the vessel, to wit, the still". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the body does nothing except it putrefy
        and it cannot putrefy except with Mercury. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the Philosophers, "for with one
        part of the body are six and thirty parts of the water to be
        taken, and let putefraction be made with moist gentle fire of
        hot and moist dung, and in no ways with others, so that nothing
        may ascend. Because if any thing should ascend a separation
        would partly be made, which ought not to be done, until the male
        and female are perfectly joined together, and one received the
        other, the sign whereof is the superficies in the nature of
        perfect solution". </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must know that when the Earth is a little
        made white, there it is termed Pregnation, because then the
        Earth is Impregnated. For when the Earth is joined with an
        imperfect body, it is called Our Earth, because the Earth is the
        Mother of all the elements, and this is that which they term
        [unidentified alchemical symbol], when the Earth begins to
        retain with it somewhat of <i>Arsenic</i>, or Our Salt, or
        Argent vive, for then it is called a Conception, because the
        male acteth towards the female, because the Mystery of the
        Philosophers is nothing else but the male and female and their
        conjunction. Water coming to them, that is <i>Arsenic</i> or
        Our Salt, which increases much in the Earth and is augmented and
        comes out when the Earth is dealbated, then it is called a
        Pregnation, because the Earth having conceived goes away
        pregnant. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, that here and in the former
        Chapter, the little star formed of seven fold little pricks,
        becometh Red but not fully, it signifies that the matter of the
        Stone now shut up in the Philosophical phial, hath in some part
        suffered putrefaction, but it is far from a plenary
        mundification, which is made in the bottom of the vessel. For it
        ought to purge further, as is demonstrated by the thirteenth
        Chapter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whereas the Red and White is not
        compounded of Red and White, but of Black and White, there is no
        doubt but by the help of the Governor of all things, it will in
        short space come into perfect whiteness. But that the little
        star is not deprived of his blackness, appeareth by the black
        complements sticking to the little points and planets. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must know, therefore, my Son, lest thou
        should err, that there are four things that are altogether
        requisite or necessary to Nature in the Generation of metals.
        First, to have composing principles, one whereof hath itself as
        the Matter, the other is the form of composing. Secondly, to
        have that due weight of the principles. Thirdly, a fit place is
        altogether required, that is a solid place, for unless the place
        where Nature mingleth were according to the two principles
        solid, the Vapours which are also termed Spirit would exhale,
        and the solidity of the place doth condensate or thicken those
        spirits already mixed, from whence it is they begin to act and
        suffer one towards the other, by subtilizing and separating
        impurities. The fourth thing requisite in the generation of
        metals is heat temperated, by which metals are in the end
        excluded and exhaled into the air. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these things required are necessary in
        the art to generate the Stone, all which the artist by imitating
        Nature in all things, except in her weight, shall easily
        conceive that the Stone may be gotten. But let him take the

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fermentation with the Philosophers is the
        incorporation of the Animal part, the restoration of the vapour,
        the inspiration of the odour, the supplying of the beings, and
        it is double White and Red, whose ferment is the Sun, the Sun of
        the Sun, the Moon of the Moon. That is, the Sun is ferment to
        the Gold, or Red Elixir, and the Moon is ferment to the Silver,
        or White elixir. <br>
        But as substantial bodies, and fixed upon the fire, cannot
        manifest their qualities, neither do live or are lifted up of
        themselves, unless by the benefit of spirituality, they are
        first purified and vivificated, so neither can spiritual
        accidence manifest their permanent virtue, except they are
        united and perpetuated with fixed bodies. For then and not
        before, the body inbreatheth the spirit, teaching him by
        vigorating, to reluct, strive or struggle against the fire, and
        the spirit embraceth the body teaching him to pierce through
        gross bodies, actually to subtilize thick ones, and to generally
        cure all infirmities and diseases. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the intention of Fermentation is that
        the thing to be fermented should be prepared, washed, calcined,
        and dissolved, that it may the better be joined with the subtle
        work or body, that is to say, White ferment with White, and Red
        with Red. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet these things not hindering, my Son, you
        are to know that Fermentation doth not change the powder of the
        Stone into any form but his own, but it giveth savor, odour, and
        strength to transmute other bodies to his own nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by the Toad, here understand the sphere
        of Saturn swelling with tincture, or his heaven to be great and
        impregnate therewith, and by and by ready to bring forth, which
        by the ejection of the four elements appeareth most plainly in
        the next Chapter, in the conversion of whom one after another,
        until they are inseparably fixed, dependeth the chief
        completement of this work. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Separation of the Elements</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We being about to speak concerning the
        generation of the elements and their conjunction, by reason that
        one of them cannot be understood without the other, we shall
        handle them both together in this and the subsequent Chapter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the separation of the elements in
        this art is nothing else than to separate or segregate
        heterogeneous (which are accidents from homogeneous (which are
        of the Essence of the Stone), that at length the mixture of the
        elements might be most pure and perfect. But the conjunction of
        the elements is to keep up homogeneous things, that is, those
        that are of the nature of the Radical Moisture. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Raymond "have patience in dealbation
        or whitening, because here lieth much tardity". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must know further, my Son, that the
        separation of the elements with the Philosophers is termed the
        conversion of them, as if to convert the elements was to make a
        thin body of a gross one, that is, of the body a spirit, and
        afterwards of the moist a dry, of water earth, and the elements
        are converted one into the other. But the Philosophers do
        prescribe such a manner of converting the body into the spirit.
        The earth is resolved into water, and water into air, the air
        into fire, but the spirit is turned into the body. This way the
        fire is coagulated and it becomes air, but the air is coagulated
        and becomes water, but the water is coagulated and becomes
        earth. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From whence saith Assidnus "behold elements
        hath met together in one nature, who when they are so impelled
        (that is coagulated) become friends, but when they wax thin they
        become enemies. Therefore convert the elements and thou shalt
        find what thou seeketh". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It behovest thee, therefore, first of all to
        mortify and exalt the Stone, that is, the body, soul and spirit,
        seeing that no one gains any thing in this art except he
        mortifieth, but mortification is by the separation of the
        elements, by which the effect of every element is shown. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore if thou wilt make the elixir, it
        will be necessary that thou break this Stone into his elements,
        which is signified by the parts of the year, and then conjoin
        the elements by fire, Mercury mediating, which is the
        Philosopher's chiefest secret, and then this Mystery is
        completed, for all the art is placed in conjoining and loosing.
        But these separations are done as seest, my Son, Mercury
        mediating, for it first looseth the body and makes separation
        which in the meantime are conjoined by Salt and Mercury. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here we must diligently note it is first
        of all Mercury, in the beginning of the work is called water,
        then the blackness appearing earth, then being sublimated air,
        and being made red is called fire. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then being sublimated with some luminary
        body it is termed Salt. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then being added to the whole composed
        matter it is called the Spirit. And so the Earth, with Water,
        Air and Fire, is a body, the Salt is the life, the last watering
        of the only Mercury, the spirit. <br>
        It is therefore evident that the Stone consisteth of four
        elements, to wit, Water, Air, Fire and Earth. For in the Stone
        there are the Soul, the Body and Spirit, and yet but one Stone,
        as it is above said, behoving to loose and coagulate him again,
        then all the operations are contained under the Solution until
        the Albifaction it is sodden again, and becomes a Stone again
        when it is coagulated. Afterwards it is loosed again and then
        the solution is reiterated, until the Stone comes out like wax.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ortus in this art is termed to be
        conjunction of the second salt or ferment, with the imperfect
        body prepared. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Morien "we must know that the
        knowledge of our Mystery is likened to the creation of Man. For
        first there is conjunction, then conception, then pregnation,
        then Ortus or a springing or rising, a bringing forth, then
        Nutrition". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore have thee understand this
        one thing, because our seed is Argent vive. When the Earth is
        joined to an imperfect body, which is termed Our Earth, because
        the Earth is the Mother of all the elements, and they call it
        Copulation. But when the Earth begins to retain with it
        something of the Argent vive, then it is termed Conception, when
        the male acteth towards the female. But when the Earth is made
        white then it is called Pregnation, because it is then pregnant,
        and then the ferment is joined with the imperfect body until
        they become one in species and aspect, and then it is termed
        Ortus, because our Stone is then born, which is called a King by
        the Philosophers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon it is said amongst them "Honour
        your King coming from the Fire. Crown him with a Diadem, and
        bring him up even to perfect age, whose Father is the Sun, his
        true Mother the Moon". </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Unnatural Fire or Fermentation</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the philosopher are four fires
        recorded, to wit, Natural, Unnatural, against Nature, and
        Elementary, and these fires may better be known by their
        complexion and compositions. For out of Mercury dissolving and
        conjoined in the body, there becomes another Mercury, which is
        called Adrop, Thick Water, Our Water, the Second Water, which is
        Fire, Strong Fire, Unnatural Fire. For those two, to wit, Spirit
        and Body, being fit and joined together according to their due
        proportion, out of them this second Mercury, which we have
        described is made, and this is that Mercury of which it is
        written, that in it is whatsoever wise men seek, for the body,
        the soul and the Tincture are drawn from this Mercury. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the second Mercury is moist in the
        vapour, not oily but gummy, of a property indifferent, subtle,
        easily lying the sharpness of the fire, and vanishing away in
        it, possessing both body and spirit in loosing remaining water
        in itself. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover by Fermentation in this place,
        understand the second fermentation, because the Stone,
        especially the Inferior part thereof, should as yet be better
        prepared, washed, calcined, and dissolved, that it may yet unto
        a more higher and nobler degree of perfection, whereby it may
        the better be joined with any subtle work or body. </p>

        indifferently mixed, yet is far from being sufficiently
        mundified, seeing as yet it wanteth much purgation, as by the
        same blackness which it hath in putrefaction, appearing in the
        next Chapter. By the bird flying from above, understand the

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Exaltation is an ingenious
        nobiliating of the magnet or lodestone being dealbated, which is
        chiefly by the augmentation of the spirit, the sublimation of
        the Earth, the promotion of the liquefaction by the exaltation
        of the rectified elements, and by a lively constituting of the
        Fifth Essence out of them. From whom, saith the Philosophers,
        "when thou hast had the Water out of the Air, the Air out of the
        Fire, and the Fire out of the Earth, then thou mayest know that
        then the Stone hath lost the Water which he had at first out of
        the Air, after his resolution into it. For the Air and Water are
        contiguous elements, more light in mixing and better in
        operation of fire". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the cold hath overcome the hot, the Air
        is turned into Water, but when the hot hath overcome the cold,
        the Water is turned into Air, but thou must have the Air out of
        the Fire by his Solution. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover now you see the four elements
        wonderfully altered, exalted and almost fixed. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the azure colour understand the Earth
        turned into Air, by the green colour the Air turned into Water,
        by the yellow colour Water turned into Fire, lastly by the
        colour somewhat brown understand the Fire to be turned into
        Earth. By which wonderful alteration is further signified that
        the Stone now draweth nigh to Fixation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Pelican penetrating and wounding her
        own breast, from which rivers of blood do seem to flow,
        understand that this is spoken of the Pelican by a similitude
        which is called the Blood of Love, for as she doth impart her
        blood to her young ones, so the Stone being brought to a
        Quintessence by conversion into the four elements, is ready to
        impart his tincture to the imperfect wanting it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly in that you have in the following
        figure the bird of Hermes sleeping in the midst and applying
        himself to perpetual rest, understand the discords and hatred of
        enemies, that is, of the elements, are laid aside, lulled asleep
        by their long alterations and conversions, laid before our eyes
        in the former Chapters. But from the fire from above temperately
        cherishing the Matter, the artificer buildeth the reason of
        making his Athanor. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let putrefaction and much conversion be upon
        him until it being well purged by sublimation he be made white.
        For as Marcus saith "when he has drunk his burning Mercury he
        passeth away and remaineth in the shadows of purgatory with many
        nights, but conceiveth in baths, and brought forth in the Air,
        then waxeth Red, goes upon the Water, and is white upon the
        tops, and is become White, light and airy, which first was
        ponderous, dry and obscure fire. For the Sun being Exalted the
        air waxeth hot and drieth". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But take this concerning the fifth essence
        in this work and Mastery, is the mixing of all the four
        elements, and the reduction of them into one pure substance. If
        therefore thou wilt see the Stone, to wit, the fifth substance
        by the four elements, thou must know that if every one of them
        do not partake of the fifth nature, the Stone cannot be united
        nor conjoined with a dry body. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixation in this art is when the body
        receives a tinctural or colouring spirit and takes away his
        volatility or flying, which is by frequent iteration, until it
        becomes ashes of everlasting duration, and the whole remains in

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must know further that fixation is always
        in the white, though not every fixation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must know moreover, that out of the
        perfection of fixation, the fire becomes cold, by whose benefit
        alone the Stone comes out fixed. When the hidden Mystery of him
        is made manifest, his colour is Citrine or Red, but after his
        first fixation in the white, there follows no error in the whole
        Mystery, although you proceed to the Crowning of Nature by often
        passing the Philosophical Wheel, and by bettering your blessed
        Stone by many reiterated solutions and coagulations. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projection in this art is the reduction of
        the fixed earth Multiplicative, or a formal substance firmly
        coloured, upon much of convenient matter, to the desired joy of
        the Artist. But because it is not well perceived, cast one pound
        upon a thousand, but before this moist medicine may go out, the
        Philosophers have noted some necessity of Ceration. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence speaketh Anonimous "it is better to
        project, now thou dost cast upon fundaments, and fundaments
        upon. My word, I will love thee, O Lord. I will have thee
        attend, the which reason is in Saffron. If the Saffron should be
        projected dry it would colour but little, but if being loosed it
        be joined with a little liquor, and that little into much, it
        would colour infinitely. Thou shalt therefore make thy
        Projection so. First multiply 10 into 10 and then there will be
        100, and 100 into 100 and they will be 10000, and so into
        infinity". But this cannot be done without Ceration, which the
        Wise have so defined "Ceration is the fitting of a hard and not
        fusible Medicine to Liquefaction by a frequent Imbibition". </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Morien in the <i>Rosary,</i> "the
        whole Mystery is nothing else than an extraction of Water out of
        the Earth, and a casting of Water on the Earth, until both it
        and the Earth putrefy, and become clean, seeing as yet the Earth
        to be mingled with the Water, and the Water or temperate
        decoction to be a little diminished, the other to increase".
        They all say that this was perfect Ceration, from whence they
        have also said further, that the Earth, when the Water is Cered,
        drunk up and dried with the temperated decoction of the Sun,
        that is, the heat, and is turned into Earth, that therein is the
        whole matter. For his force, as that divine Hermes speaketh, is
        entire if it were turned into Earth. But enough and more than
        enough has been said of the taking away of the Leprousy of
        Metals. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the curing of Man's body and continual
        health, understand these things from a few days to a longer
        time. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a month every day let there be taken of
        this blessed powder, the quantity of a grain of mustard seed, in
        white wine or in any other liquor, early in the morning. It is
        sudorific or causing sweat, if anything be, to be sent forth by
        the pores. It is laxative, if anything be, to be evacuated by
        stool. It is diuretic, if anything be, to be driven forth by the
        passage of urine. But it is never vomative, as that is
        altogether contrary to nature. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, that I may briefly conclude, all
        this powder is like Ethereal fire, pleasantly consumes all the
        hurtful superfluities in Man's body, raising it up, rectifying,
        and bringing it to a just temperature and equality. Furthermore,
        it not only rectifieth Man's body but also reneweth the whole
        man, by the use thereof continued for a few weeks, Lastly, none
        of the three principles, to wit, of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,
        can in the least exalt itself. But presently, by one little
        grain, taken as aforesaid, the disease is rooted out, and a man
        is continued safe and sound without diseases, until the time

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last Chapter it is made known what it
        is in general, but not how many fold, but it is by two ways, to
        wit, quality and quantity But because the Wise have left us a
        perfect and known complete method concerning this doctrine of
        Imbibition, and of their ways of operation which follow plainly
        and fully the Crowning of Nature, I shall altogether give over
        speaking of them. <br>
        I shall add this, instead of the Crown concerning the ruling of
        Saturn, let a mineral be taken of the same, existing in his
        first being. Let it putrefy in the belly of a horse, according
        to the Philosophical month, to wit, 40 days. After putrefaction,
        by the benefit of Distillation, let the Vinegar so often spoken
        of, be extracted, to radically dissolve all the metals of the
        Philosophers. Let that blessed produced vinegar be put upon
        other Saturn, who from whence may go forth into transparent
        redness dissolved. Let the redness be extracted and putrefied
        anew, for the space of a Philosophical month in a horses belly.
        Then in a strong vessel let it be first urged with a gentle
        fire, afterwards a strong fire being used, the Red Oil will go
        forth like blood, through a 1000 small veins. Let the dead head
        be reduced into Alcool, or subtle powder, calcined, and with
        phlegm reserved for this use, let it be drunk up and digested
        and evapourated. Thou shalt have then his natural Salt which if
        thou wilt mingle with the predicated oil and do urge back again,
        the red oil will go out transparent, colouring the heavenly
        Stone, when it hath been coloured by himself. But by the
        specifical Salt or Ferment, this is truth. </p>
