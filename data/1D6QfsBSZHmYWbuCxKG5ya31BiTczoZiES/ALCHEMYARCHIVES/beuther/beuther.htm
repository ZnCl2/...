      <p>Highly Esteemed Reader: </p>
      <p>Doubtless, it has been a cause of wonderment in many places why
        persons expert in chemistry allow these highly regarded writings
        to have been permitted to be printed freely and openly, since
        the same ideas are found to be highly regarded by the possessors
        of a few manuscripts and here and there have been sold for 1000
        thalers or more, although copies of the same are frequently
        available for sale. </p>
      <p>However, this is precisely the reason why a candid patriot has
        given the same to be printed. Moreover, since it is seen that
        such a shameful practice has been involved in the case of such
        manuscripts, whereby many of them had no understanding at all of
        the writing but nevertheless supposed that they must have
        purchased something really valuable for such a small amount of
        money, jeopardized all their earthly possessions therefore and
        chased after pipe dreams, so that, through love of the second
        best, in the open publication of such manuscripts, they thought
        to eliminate a small part of that which they could not
        understand, by which means at least an attempt was made to save
        as much of the cost of such manuscripts, of which they
        understood how to be able to obtain, from the wide sea of the
        earth, graciously at every opportunity. </p>
      <p>You might then see how to recognize our good intentions and
        admonitions, which will not be omitted where knowledge is found
        therein to return the same to God and our neighbors, not
        forgetting ourselves in the process. </p>
      <p>What, accordingly, the author himself arrived at (since he was
        born a German and had lived in the 16th century up to the year
        1580 at the Court of the Elector and Guardian of the Mint)
        indeed in the chemical laboratory of Lowenstein, wherein he
        found a complete history, which he considered to be noteworthy
        and which he subsequently expanded considerably. </p>
      <p>I will point out that it is noted on page 565 in the Records of
        the Court of the Elector of Saxony (under the guidance of the
        Holy Church through Prince August and Prince John Christian I,
        reported from the year 1580 to the year 1591). Prince Augustus
        authorized David Beuther as one adept in experimental skill to
        subsequently act as an assayer at the Mint of St Anneberg. In
        the Cloister, attached t the same at present, where he intended
        to have his quarters and laboratory, he roped off an area near
        the wall, from which a little plaster had fallen, and depended
        therein. Afterward he occupied the place, although the plaster
        continued to fall off, so that rectangular patches had to be
        removed. All this has been described subsequently in Dec. 3, the
        particulars of which are termed Pyrotechnics. The first of these
        explains how two firings of types of ‘black sulfur’ gave from a
        pound of iron in ordinary water, finely pulverized copper after
        28 hours of firing. Such copper was subsequently dissolved in
        distilled water and in 4 weeks the result was a precipitate of
        fine gold. Another particular involved the transmutation of tin
        and mercury into silver by using the same precipitation process.
        The third particular comes by the Rule of Martial Antimony,
        which he made by means of a Crocus of Mars and Venus, prepared
        by casting gold and silver in the molten state. What he might
        have obtained by this process, nobody has ever been able to get
        out of him. </p>
      <p>However, as he had prescribed in his work, he considered
        everything in order and set out in unhurried endeavor, limiting
        himself to a few (12) projects in one place or another, so
        familiar to him that he could oversee all of them. Accordingly,
        under the circumstance, all of these were added together in the
        end and he had completed many of them, and indeed with so little
        fanfare that the Elector himself had heard nothing about them.
        However, Beuther no longer deemed his services to include the
        tests and counter tests, so long as his work in the case of the
        metals was completely unhurried, making use of the Elector’s
        instruments, laboratory, and materials, at will. This was quite
        a heavy investment, particularly since nothing could be made
        subsequently of all that he showed them and, for this reason,
        his work was almost totally worthless, but nevertheless, when
        finally completed, the work was presented as such to the
        Elector. Beuther was asked, when he appeared to answer the
        apparent complaints against him as a result of his 12 failures,
        about them; Beuther could no longer lie about such and had to
        admit plainly that the Elector had laid before him the
        stipulation and decision that Beuther should, in conformity with
        the contracts made with him, be held at fault, in accordance
        with his promise to disclose such information to him completely,
        so long as they should remain in Dresden and agree to give the
        Elector 10% of the gold and silver, as well as also to hand over
        the above for a certain amount of the metal, while the Elector
        would require half of the entire amount as a reward for his
        part. In the meantime, Beuther was held as a virtual hostage.
        This vexed Beuther so sorely that he decided to practice his
        profession no longer. When he revealed this decision to the
        others, things began to get much better, although he could
        conclude nothing. Because of this, the Elector was very
        displeased, although he had formerly been very kind to him; he
        was, however, allowed to leave prison and return to England. </p>
      <p>However, a decision was reached to send him to Leipzig and he
        was taken to Gravamina. The decision was reached to first
        question him in detail about the process, threatening him with
        flogging for his misinformation and with cutting of 2 fingers
        for making false claims, and detaining him indefinitely so that
        he could not give this information to another monarch. This was
        read to him on a Saturday, the Elector having written these
        words to him by his own hand. Beuther had again given to me what
        came to me by God and Justice, even though I must undertake
        something with you on Monday which I would willingly reconsider.
        In the margin may be found these words: I beg you to prevent it
        from coming to this, and furthermore it be written I know very
        well that I can do it if you are present and I will also be able
        to do it even though you are not present. </p>
      <p>All this information about Beuther, which this publication
        includes briefly, was supplied by the person who was at that
        time the private secretary to the Elector of Saxony and
        approximates what was the content of his report: My approach
        simply might be for the Elector of Saxony not to allow Beuther
        to vex himself, since he, as a headstrong man, might --- out of
        desperation --- cause a lot of trouble and considerable bother.
        In addition, Beuther might be persuaded to write a letter to the
        Elector of Saxony, in which he might bring his complaint and
        request the Elector to accept a solution in which he would no
        longer henceforth be required to remain silent. He would accept
        such a solution and again return to the House of Gold, as the
        Laboratory of the Elector of Saxony was sometimes called, based
        on its earlier reputation, although by then a protective cover,
        the Library, which was still in use at the time of Kunkel (the
        Year 1677) --- was associated with it. Since Kunkel sought to
        practice this art extensively, Beuther published the process in
        its entirety, even though it was quite different and affirmed
        the same conclusion. </p>
      <p>Based on this process, Kunkel wrote a 4 page summary which
        Beuther had suggested in <i>The Arsenic</i> in place of a
        highly dubious work which the esteemed Elector had penned with
        his own hand. I must explain that I had no part in this
        nonsense. </p>
      <p>Thereupon Kunkel continued the narration in the following
        manner: </p>
      <p>Afterwards Beuther was reinstated in his former post and had
        been given the above mentioned guarantee of protection, and he
        wrote a letter containing particular data to the Elector,
        begging him to help him by sending him 100 guilders and pay
        within 8 weeks in fine silver or gold all of his past due wages.
        Such gold as he had obtained from the Elector had been repaid.
        In this way Beuther had also been seen largely as the protector
        of the Art, even though he was not completely responsible for
        instructing the Elector until Beuther had finally obtained a
        reasonable sum of several marks, which are as good as gold,
        although he said (so the word goes) that they were no better
        than horse manure. "Now, I could help you with 9 pennies, which
        are perfectly good", he said. Consequently, Beuther sent away to
        his protector in order to get something more, since afterwards
        he had to start a fire using the bellows. His protection was
        perceived as having come to an end, that Beuther had terminated
        his employment and had, so to speak, jumped into the fire. As he
        now returned according to his orders, then Beuther lay on his
        back without understanding. And whether, indeed, in all
        deliberate speed, medical practitioners and priests were called
        in, nevertheless nothing would have had any beneficial effect on
        him and he would have died before their very eyes. The
        arrangement had been concluded hitherto and he had come to
        believe that he had made a bad bargain. How Beuther had
        afterwards disposed of his substance or how he concealed it,
        Herr Kunkel could in no manner learn. Then the highly esteemed
        Elector, Johann George, had said to him, and to the others, that
        he had this tormenting matter, in which the actions of a
        worthless fellow had also been shown, which according to the
        Elector Augustus had caused him to be burned in the venture. He
        had also given orders to his secretary --- at that time, one
        Lincker --- and after that to Kunkel. To burn in the same way
        wheat was still left of Beuther’s work, so that his successors
        might not try to make use of what they might find within. Which
        command, however, had not been carried out, since from the
        counsel of the principal director a part of the remembrances
        would be hidden and, hopefully, the original could again be
        found. </p>
      <p>Herr Kunkel would have reported in detail, certain reasons,
        namely, to protect the highmindedness of the august Elector of
        Saxony who, in ordinary language, would have done him an
        injustice and caused Beuther to face an extended imprisonment,
        and moreover, would have made no contributions to the truth. The
        Elector of Saxony had shown Beuther so much kindness and, even
        more, might be so indebted to him (as noted in the
        above-mentioned arrangement that he had made with him and 12
        other persons to observe those gentlemen who should not be
        blamed). In the first place, Beuther was a subject; on the other
        hand, the Elector had brought him up; in the third place,
        Beuther had begun the practice of this Art in the service of the
        Elector and had shown his loyalty to the Elector and had given
        that most esteemed gentleman his loyalty, above all others and
        had done so openly. </p>
      <p>This far had Herr Kunkel gone in his description of Beuther’s
        life and accomplishments. He prepared at this time certain
        extracts which he had drawn up from the work in his laboratory,
        recorded by the private secretary at that time, which can be
        found on display in the Laboratory Records on page 579 and
        following. And, finally, the account of Beuther’s work is given
        on page 585, where he prepared the gold, and from all these
        accounts it is to be seen as also true that he has accomplished
        all these things. Whether, however, from the so-called black
        sulfur, as he termed it, he obtained a special tincture, cannot
        be ascertained with certainty. It must be considered how
        favorably inclined was the Elector toward Beuther, and how
        inconsiderate Beuther had been in return, and how he had placed
        himself in considerable mortal danger, although he was evidently
        right in this matter. </p>
      <p>Herr Tuschky, the former grounds overseer for the Elector of
        Saxony, has also written in his outline of Gebaldis’ <i>Black
          Magic</i>, printed in manuscript form, on page 89, about this
        Beuther: "He, David Beuther is actually a professor and has
        published a work called Particulars and another work called <i>Lapidis</i>
        (Precious Stones) and is a learned man, who has also produced
        for the Elector of Saxony much gold and silver, an Art, however,
        which obviously has not been completely revealed until recently,
        despite the fact that he knew very well that the Elector already
        had access to such a great artificer as he was. Moreover, the
        Elector himself has always offered him all kinds of good things,
        even specie (currency of the realm) since David Beuther was
        already pregnant with the idea, so that the Elector begged to
        sponsor him and after that, as was usual at that time, although
        only the sponsor should name the terms, although, however, the
        good words did not help at all, since Beuther excused his
        actions in the conviction, that, the same had been given
        credence much less employed, since many cabalistically
        questionable things had been allowed to creep in because of
        this. In the Year 1580 he was thereupon cast into prison because
        of practicing such Art, as already mentioned, where he had
        written in his own hand: "Imprisoned cats do not catch mice", by
        which it was meant to be understood that he, since he had to
        remain in prison, could accomplish no useful work for the House
        of Saxony. Since he was now finally offered the opportunity to
        transmute so much gold and silver as requested of him from
        material available to him, he was also allowed, without further
        restraint, to be able not to take notice therewith that he had
        finally resolved t take the desperate measure of drinking a
        beaker full of wine containing strong poison, against which no
        physician would advise, thereby also terminating his life, so
        that the House of Saxony would a the same time be deprived of
        both his person and of his knowledge of an important Art". </p>
      <p>Moreover, one finds in the refining fire of the chemist a
        categorical judgment of him, which reads as follows: Beuther is
        known as an adept of this Art and is unable to lie to anyone. He
        has been to Dresden and is the author of very much original
        work, even though the Elector of Saxony frequently threatens him
        with the hangman’s noose, since he intended to retain him as an
        examiner, while directing him. He then took a large amount of
        the tincture and gave it to him as a poison. Even in his daily
        journal, which nobody referred to at all, but the conclusion of
        which we hold valid, although the author, as well as his Art (as
        explained from all his judgments) fared well and prospered. </p>
      <p>From all of these curious investigations, differing to some
        extent on the circumstances of the author, and on certain
        minerals, animals, and vegetables, especially those which the
        sophists made use of in preparing precious stones, which the
        author also cited in the Foreword of Beuther’s <i>Testing and
          Art</i>, which he had also described on page 9 of the same:
        "David Beuther, whose tincture was dyed a strikingly bright
        cardinal color, even if revealing a considerable knowledge of
        this Art, would drive him straight to the hangman, though he
        might have given himself poison, which might have been more
        sensible". </p>
      <p>His written reports, which might even now be allowed to be
        published, as noted in <i>Particulars</i>, might well then be
        the true natural philosophy and form of the Art and know how to
        maintain at a reasonable fair price. Then, so that the author
        might thereby prove himself to b a genuine authority and
        likewise show by introduction of the same how the Sun, Moon,
        Mercury and Saturn are extracted not by methods from the metals,
        but from their inactive state; and just as these materials are
        from the tree and the root, from which ordinary gold is
        obtained, many thousand times better than the gold and silver in
        nature and substances. </p>
      <p>To be sure, he teaches almost the entire Art, since these
        excellent materials are also prepared by calcinations, solution,
        sublimation, purification, and coagulation,, so that the Art
        acquires a special; degree of perfection and gives color to the
        impure unrefined metals, so that they will all again be in a
        basic solid form. Moreover, it is stated on page 13 even more
        clearly, that thought shows that the entire Art depends on the
        availability of the proper material (not just one, nor even two,
        but all from a single root) and their solutions, so that nothing
        more will be necessary, except a fire and nitrogen, and that the
        same (even the materials) will be the gold of the philosophers,
        for which he states the truth from all the philosophers of the
        entire world. </p>
      <p>In what is to follow in this report, as indeed in all reports
        on natural philosophy, it is the lack of knowledge about this
        process, which in fact does not pertain to a universal idea, but
        in particular might find a major use in the knowledge of the
        universal nature of this material, despite some abuse and
        misleading statements. When, however, attention is paid only
        where the philosophers’ gold the philosophers’ mercury, mercuric
        ores, the electro-minerals of Paracelsus, red cinnabar ore, and
        white arsenic (which of all of them alone, only the true
        material, and sulfur and mercury is that material, is separable
        as a salt) are concerned, it is implied from what was said that
        he indicated what he ascribed to the Art and to method of
        operation and how he showed the preparation and testing of the
        same, so that he would be able, when finally chosen for that
        purpose by God, to know immediately the proper and most
        practical material to use and to readily show that all of his
        processes were different, even though quite similar to one
        another. </p>
      <p>However, if one desired to demonstrate certain of his processes
        and also to include questionable and misleading historical
        processes, he should not then be considered an adept but should
        be considered even more of an imposter, since, in particular,
        the energetic Kunkel in his chemical laboratory had not even
        reported praiseworthy work of his own and the well-known Dr
        Petraeus had not desired to report innovation in his newly
        published <i>Preface to the Works of Basil Valentine</i>, or
        that he had sold for gold some questionable processes now and
        then or that he himself had seen some of the same works in
        manuscript form, the author who had communicated them to him
        having originated them. For the two processes involving Mercury
        and Jupiter, I have given this David Beuther 800 German dollars
        of pure gold, so that I can now demonstrate, using his
        hand-written notes, that he assured me are faithfully
        transcribed, that I have found it as he also said and not
        otherwise, in the year 1605. Thus, it is primarily from the
        questionable and misleading historical processes tat particular
        processes are not to be considered the same, although he, too,
        like that great King of the Arabs, Geber, in his report recorded
        before the forming of the Art, although nothing, however, before
        the others. Moreover, the principal preparation of one or
        another of the ingredients from the universal material had
        already been carried out, as had become clearly evident from the
        above-mentioned work of Kunkel, page 580, which reads: "The
        white arsenic powder is no longer prepared for the Elector of
        Saxony and unfortunately, the whole Art rests upon it", as noted
        by Beuther himself on page 7. </p>
      <p>Where will particulars be found, when the universal is
        questionable? Thereupon he said that without the knowledge of
        the true universal material (I don’t say the properties of
        lapidis, for I am of the opinion that somebody will still be
        able to learn to recognize the universal material and from it
        produce the particulars and still, nevertheless, not be able to
        make the largest gems in this manner) no effective particular
        type of gem can be made. He who knows how to make this same
        white material can make his process successful, while others
        cannot. For that reason, therefore, his process made him no
        imposter, since he indeed allowed no one to copy it or print it
        who did not verbally disclose the Key and who entrusted no one
        to elaborate on it, even those who understood the spirit of the
        idea, as conceived above. Furthermore, the report of the
        energetic Kunkel can be shown to be correct in all its parts,
        since it clarified, from many passages found therein, that
        probably do not adequately reflect properly on various aspects,
        or even on enemies which he would perhaps have liked to have
        discussed --- men such as Oerthlin, Schirmen, Jacob Beuther,
        Hans Weinhold, and Heidler, to whom Kunkel referred on pages
        654, 572, and 585, and might well have proven, or perhaps only
        suggested, that patently false material provided no strong
        evidence at all. Besides, Kunkel’s report clearly states in many
        places that he was guilty of no deceptions, but had been a true
        adept, who had made much gold and silver, although the method if
        such Art would not be disclosed at this time, even though
        unreliable processes continued to be reported. Finally, the
        report of Dr Perraeri had been obtained and found to disclose
        the time, whether he had not verbally given at the same time
        both the Key to his process and the purchaser and whether he had
        not found all this information to be correct, or whether this in
        itself had been capable, even when he, too, had the Key, of
        disclosing the process according to the proper state of the Art.
      </p>
      <p>As, however, the various circumstances became known, and a few
        would become known, that he had found in a well in Dresden of
        this Art, he came forward with the Tincture --- though others
        had described it. He had obtained the tincture as a strikingly
        bright cardinal color and found it to be a poison. On account of
        defects in the otherwise satisfactory report, it is difficult to
        separate. However, I do not believe that a philosopher is
        particularly likely to think this discussion appropriate. </p>
      <p>Also it would not be necessary for us to judge his performance
        and why he kept his Art so secret and risked death himself
        rather than clarify the matter or disclose it intelligently. For
        who has seen inside God’s judgments --- or who has ever been His
        advisor. </p>
      <p>As a postscript, this written report is offered as proof of the
        strange alchemical behavior of copper, which was discovered by
        the same Beuther and also warrants authorization of his
        manuscripts, although in his writings he does not refer to it
        directly. </p>
      <p>These are the same, I say out of singular curiosity, which
        demonstrate completely and in great detail the entire
        philosophical work and actual material, which can only be
        understood and depicted clearly and taught as an entire process.
        I should also offer at this time a clear explanation of the
        same, but I am afraid that the whole matter has become more
        muddled than clarified. And I cannot in any way understand how,
        even only briefly, an even greater man has done it, by being
        able to work with incomparable chemical copper and such
        sophisticated additions, sublimations, and imbibitions, which
        are actually blamed on a natural philosophy that has never been
        considered. While it must be a general rule in this work, as
        stated by Arnold de Villa Nova, and again on page 66, that only
        a few minerals, a few medicines, an arrangement, a work, and
        some equipment, along with white arsenic and burning sulfur,
        which were to be made at the same time, as Geber had said:
        "There is only one mineral, one medicine, one digestion; and in
        this our entire work consists, to which we add nothing
        unfamiliar, or take nothing away, without removing excess
        impurities therefrom in the process". </p>
      <p>Furthermore, nothing remains for us to do but to mention once
        more, to the reader to do his best to follow the processes of
        the author so that they may be coordinated with true
        philosophical matters. So long as, and until the same are
        confirmed for the first time, and afterwards at all times, to be
        correct, from which Dr Helvetius, in his <i>Vitulo Arco</i>, in
        <i>Mutatis Mutandis</i>, says: "I beg you, my friends, that you
        recognize the actual real materials, and do not forget them and
        their rule in the investigation of this Art, and give attention
        to their irreversible change while in contact with fire, for you
        will never find them without this information, live well".
        Reported from my study room this St John’s Day in these old
        lands, as Steiner has written, thus the true solution will be
        found. The Year is 1718. </p>

      <p>(d) At the bottom is a heated place, as well as a snake in a
        fountain. Its tail is long and it has broad wings. It is ready
        to fly in all directions. Beware of such a fountain all the way
        round it. For your snake might get out of there. In case it does
        get out you will have lost the art of working with minerals,
        which is your motive. You must know that. Also what is in your
        furnace is so perfectly clear. And what is your serpent, with
        such a long tail? Although such work is of little use, your
        fountain must be able to burn in clear water. See well to this
        costly Fire, for your fire shall be able to burn in water. And

        lied in the mud and bursts open when blown up too much, which
        dies as though bitten by a snake and passes through many shades
        of color changes and finally becomes white as a bone. From the
        water contained therein, make him pure and free from his sins,
        and let him drink less and less, for that makes him beautiful
        and white, a whiteness that is a consuming fire. For here one

      <p><i>Plate No. 3</i>, (a) Take your Father Pheobus, so shining
        and bright, who sits so high in Majesty, with his rays shining
        down on you so brightly, in all places where he is able to
        reach, for he is in truth the father of all things, the
        preserver of all life --- of plants and roots --- and makes all
        nature flourish with activity, and he is also the balm for all
        wounds. To obtain this precious gift, one has to be very
        careful, for I say to the learned and the wise, that a genuine
        soul is his nature, which God Himself has shaped by His own
        Hand, and Magnesia is his Bride, this you will come to know for
        certain. Now I will here begin to teach you a way which will not
        long remain, the which you will seldom desire to take, yet mark
        it well, all this I am saying to you; </p>
      <p>(b) Tender Phoebus, in many places with his rays, so clear and
        bright, uniting all this by his very nature, which is the source
        and mirror of all kinds of light. This Phoebus has many
        attributes of his nature which are very difficult to understand
        and where you cannot receive any understanding of what is right,
        do not attempt to find the Philosophers’ Stone because you
        formerly craved it so much, I advise you. So mark well all that
        I might say to you and make thin that which is thick, and then
        it will be very well with you. You must understand what I mean
        and have very good self-esteem in this matter, for if you let
        your work count for very little, this will make you very sad. As
        I have said in this manual, he has very many natures of which I
        am aware, some recently discovered, others long since known.
        Heed his advice, as the philosophers do. </p>
      <p>(c) In the sea, in all seriousness, dwells a little bird called
        Hermetis (Hermes Trismegistus), which can spread its wings in 4
        colors, and can be found there, steadfast and durable, even
        though all its feathers are gone, for its stays as still as a
        stone; </p>
      <p>(d) Here there is nothing but white and red, and the stone
        becomes alive which was dead, all of them and every one, in
        truth, bending only with difficulty, yet soft and malleable, and
        is now well understood, and his countenance is reflected upon. </p>

      <p><i>Plate No. 5</i>: I will tell you, without telling you
        anything that is not true, about my behavior, since genuineness
        is my father and magnesia is my mother, nitrogen is actually my
        sister and copper, in truth, is my brother. The serpent of
        Arabia is my example, which is indeed the leader of all this,
        which I formerly held to be stubborn and wild, but now know to
        be tame and mild; the Sun and the Moon with all their might
        chastise me, who though myself so brilliant. Flights of fancy so
        led me hither and yon, until I thought that, with all their
        mightiness, they brought me down to the place where they wanted
        me to be. The blood on my hands is white, causing now both
        pleasure and happiness, and loosening me from the weight of
        stone which held me down, even before I was ready to begin. Now
        make hard that which had been made soft, for fire had surrounded
        it. From my blood and water, as I well know, comes all the
        fullness (abundance) of the entire world, which then flows to
        all sorts of places where it finds it has the greatest favor. It
        flows everywhere in the entire world and spins around like a
        ball; but you must understand this most of all, so that you will
        be aware that your efforts will not fail. Because of that you
        must learn before you begin, what it is --- and for all of your
        generation it has a great many interpretations, but is, however,
        of a single nature, which you must regard as three separate
        entities combined in a Trinity and bring them all into one
        single entity by the use of the Philosophers’ Stone, which you
        see here and now. </p>

      <p>To God Alone the Glory. In the first place, from the start I
        will bear down on each of you so that you will consider that all
        wisdom comes from God and this prize towers above all earthly
        endeavors. Moreover, from God will be available such things, and
        nothing will be too great and nothing will be charged against
        him as error, so that then from the first it lies within God’s
        Omnipotence, for it is stated, as in the case of a farmer, who
        plants the seeds and knows the Tincture Process, for sure, so
        that the Lord is not lacking in power to prevent bad weather on
        render floods ineffective, especially by such high favor, which
        the greatest treasure of the world will also have, in
        particular, loyal people, earnest prayer and perception of
        Nature. I will now herewith write in this work about my attempt
        to bring the fundamentals to you, and also thereby to teach you
        how true are the presumed particulars of the processes of the
        alchemists, which are the same that one sees daily in keeping
        his promises. It is the knowledge of their power and the
        fabricated falseness which I will first of all attack --- that
        most sacred Fundamental of the Sophists will I attack by
        resorting to the true basis of nature and prove through the
        evidence of God’s Holy Word as found in the Holy Scriptures
        themselves, from which a righteous person can form a very good
        conclusion that other lesser, though not completely useless,
        persons must, nevertheless, not know the material on which alone
        stands this Art, without which no true knowledge can be found
        and, much less, shall have the knowledge of the actual
        preparations. And finally, these fundamentals constitute the
        highest tests of Mercury, the Sun, the Moon, and Saturn, through
        which the tincture may be perfected, which are referred in the
        Philosophers’ Book, which, however, are not correctly portrayed
        therein by those who do not entirely understand the
        philosophers, but only the vulgar manners of the literalist and
        consequently their pretended understanding might not be factual,
        so that what they suppose to be true Art would appear to be the
        exact opposite. To refute this, I have now given the following
        comparison to their great folly and ignorance: Human being were
        initially created by God without sin, but subsequently were
        introduced to sin by the Devil, so that not only did human
        beings, who were made in God’s image, lose their glory, but also
        both natures --- the godly and the earthly (human) --- were in
        this way corrupted, obscured, and shattered. Similarly, all
        metals are hostile to the nature of the Sun and the Moon in the
        first 3 states of both bodies because of their impure sulfurous,
        salty, and mercurial spirit, which I attribute here to the
        Devil, who entered into the human heart and stained its spotless
        nature, which was the copper, and mercury, losing thereby the
        luster and brilliance of gold. And now mention be lost not only
        by the filthiness of sin, but also their own natural medicine,
        that is, through their own flesh and blood, but they can be
        redeemed to become as the first man, even Adam, initially
        without sin. This medicine man was unto the entire human race,
        since all were sinners according to Adam’s Fall, and for this
        reason there must be a new Adam to be the Great Physician, who
        must be much greater in virtue and power in life and soul, and
        His power must be greater in all endeavors than that of all men,
        so that His Word must be ordained by God, first by the
        indwellings of men by the Holy Spirit, entering into human
        nature, so that the Redeemer of Mankind deemed it necessary to
        be at one and the same time both a man and God himself, in order
        that through such a tincture the godlike image, that had been so
        lost through sin, would again be restored completely, as pointed
        out by John in his first Chapter: In the beginning was the Word
        and the Word was co-equal with God, and the Word was God. Christ
        was also the true material of the complete medicine and
        tincture, which through His Life, His Death, His Resurrection,
        and His Ascension into Heaven prepared the Way that He obtained
        the pace second only to God the Father and has become the
        tincture of all men, It is the same with metals, which through
        their own medical practitioners are cured of their leopard spots
        and become very pure and noble, and of better habits, and so
        most simple metals and their impure materials be then also
        subjected to refining by calcinations, solution, sublimation,
        putrefaction, and coagulation, so that they attain a higher
        state of perfection, while tinctures of the impure and diseased
        Humorem Metallorum again reach the Glory of the Sun, just as did
        the man Jesus Christ. The question now really becomes, even when
        I then take gold or silver, since there are not no better metals
        than these two, according to the sayings of the philosophers:
        That which in the Sun and Moon rests upon the total Arts makes
        of them one thing, of salt, sulfur, and mercury, which indeed
        are the correct materials, knowledge and art of which can
        thereby be made complete, as there is at present no other way,
        according to the philosopher Bucher, that it can be found, and
        this is the most fundamental principle of all chemists, so that
        their greatest miracles must have a common underlying idea. </p>
      <p>To this I made answer that the philosophers had written the
        truth, but such words were, however, not correctly understood
        according to their intentions, since they still prescribe and
        say: Our Sun, Moon, and Mercury are not ordinary, but are
        philosophical I might add: Even when I add them to salt, sulfur,
        and mercury, I find that they are not ordinary, but in my
        opinion they are philosophical. Therefore, I say that it is
        possible that one can give the other without itself undergoing
        damage, that it may or may not have requirements when this
        phenomenon takes place, so that you do understand the
        philosopher Bucher correctly, so that all of the particular
        ideas are then found to be true. Where, however, this may not be
        the case, then your entire hypothesis is also worthless, which I
        will now demonstrate by showing the truth that such of your
        presumed understanding amounts to nothing, and your Sun, Moon,
        and Mercury are worth nothing here. </p>
      <p>We know that as long as men live, and body, mind, and spirit
        are in harmony with one another, then that man is a fully
        complete man. However, as soon as he dies his body becomes
        nothing more than a foul-smelling cadaver, which is no longer
        useful for anything, for his spirit and is soul (mind) have
        departed from him, in which all of the vital powers of this body
        reside, which keep him alive and maintain him through them. Now,
        however, life in him is no longer present, so that he also
        putrefies from his own very nature, and returns to the earth
        from which he came in the first place. Now shall he again live
        and be resurrected, and then his spirit and should must return
        to him as in the days of his youth, so that he might be a
        redeemed man and so remain forever. </p>
      <p>We also on this point note that so long as the gold in his
        complete nature is not destroyed --- even as gold should be
        indestructible --- then it is firmly established, and unchanging
        when subjected to fire and freed from all contaminating
        elements, and we also see that gold will be melted away by fire,
        that is a mercury, runs and rolls out as another mercury alive,
        as soon as lower temperature causes solidification to set in,
        whereupon it cools rapidly and hardens. From the above it
        becomes at once apparent that the nature of gold is that a
        mercury and the ordinary mercury is entirely like the body. Now,
        however, the mercury is fixed in the fire, which although
        common, is, however, volatile and unpredictable, and does not
        produce mercury, but rather the spirit and tincture locked up in
        it, which, since it is sulfur and sal salis, from the ordinary
        mercury we are able to make through sublimation with sulfur, and
        stratifying with sol or luna this self-same sublimate and thus
        the mercurial extracts, through the help of the sulfur, the
        spirit or tincture solis by itself, and becomes Sol or Luna,
        after which it will become stratified with one of them; on the
        other hand, however, the Sol or Luna will become Mercury, which
        is volatile and unstable in the fire, so it can be smelted, like
        all those others, and thus the sublimate is prepared by my
        methods that are known to allow a profit for the work. From this
        it now is kept constantly that the body of the solis, that is
        the Mercury, the ordinary mercury, is entirely like the body,
        and of such shape, that it is worth nothing to the Art, even
        though a few tinctures may be made therefrom, but since sulfur
        and Sal Solis are used, this give to the Mercury the
        understanding of the meaning of purification by fire. </p>
      <p>As soon as we now make the Sol into Mercury alive, then we have
        the best quality and tincture that we could desire, there in the
        twinkling of an eye, and the Mercury alive becomes unstable ad
        volatile, and extracted from its tincture and divested of the
        same; moreover, from a good thing, a bad one will come --- to
        draw a comparison, dead men are without vigor and might and have
        nothing to be able to give to another. Or the case of one having
        one of his own arms detached and is given one from another
        person. He can still not use it to help that other person. One
        might, however, also speak of the time when I take afterwards
        another Sol and restore his spirit to him and, by means of this
        Mercurium Solis extract it and coagulate it together, and as the
        philosopher speaks about it: Sulfur coagulates Mercury. Even
        according to your presumed understanding, you must nevertheless
        again take a Sol and then insert his spirit into the Mercury.
        Regardless of which use you desire to work, however, he would
        then bury the last, will not direct one blind man to another,
        and my words, which have nothing to add and which can give
        nothing to anyone else, will become true. Therefore, your
        fundamental concept is repudiated and you make a Mercury from
        the Sol and extract your tincture from it, although you will be
        considered cheap, as you would add the Sol to your tincture. </p>
      <p>Examine now your work to see whether you can make something
        noble from something that is vulgar, or an angel from a devil,
        or from the first Adam, Our Lord and Redeemer, who is also
        invariable and steady like the Sol, redeeming the fallen Adam.
        As then your fundamental concept consists of the Mercurium
        Solis, even as a pelt from your ermine. Where will your
        particular concepts remain, when the universal idea proves to be
        false? What farmer is such a fool as to dry his seeds in the
        fire before planting them or then soaking them again in water
        and then planting them and then expecting them to bear fruit? Or
        let his overseer dry them and then plant them, or graft them
        onto dry stems, so that the sap dries up? Moreover, who is now
        such a fool as to make a living tincture from a dead metal? Has
        a dead person at any time ever raised up a living man or can one
        sinful man redeem another? For Jesus Christ alone, who was
        without sin, was born of a virgin without the assistance of a
        man, and there in a lower form of man was hidden the supreme
        power of God, which however might not be displayed to help men
        to become holy before his suffering, death, and resurrection
        took place, became through the other degree of perfection for
        the everlasting tincture, through which we all could obtain the
        blessing of eternal life after partaking of this tincture. </p>
      <p>Moreover, we must from the philosopher Bucher understand this
        and so must search for another Sol, from the first all-powerful
        tincture, without fault or defect, born without sin, its
        metallic character indestructible, which had known no sin, nor
        still shown any lack of perfection, but is still in its initial
        disclosure, and in itself contains the Heavenly Balsam, the same
        as that expressed in the principal asters. Such material must be
        recognized from the very first, for without such knowledge it is
        not possible for anyone to come to everlasting life by means of
        this Art or to establish that which is true and everlasting. </p>
      <p>Now the material must be covered over by a fluid (which
        philosophers choose to call Acetum, Aquafort, Quintam Essential
        Vini, and a thousand other names, although it is really only a
        single substance) and be prepared according to philosophers’
        directions by suffering, crucifying, and resurrection, without
        putrefying with a fixed body in his Art, just as the dead body
        of Christ underwent no putrefaction, although it was dead, and
        came into existence as our tincture. </p>
      <p>Moreover, in this matter, not according to the absurd
        understanding of the ignorant, who desired to extract the spirit
        from the Sol, and from it prepare Mercury, which is corruptible,
        and no longer capable of resuscitation, to say nothing of what
        their particular concepts should being out, as long as they were
        working in invalid things, and also in Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
        Venus, Mercury, alumina, saltpeter, antimony, salt, cinnabar,
        sal ammoniac, sulfur, plants, minerals, animals, and numerous
        other things of the same type, which, however, are all
        completely invalid and objectionable, and in which no truth of
        the Art can ever be found, the same in aceto, aqua fort, or
        spiritus vini, or as it may be called, according to the
        terminology of Arnold de Villanova: When however, we take Sol or
        Luna, at the beginning of our work, but we will never find a
        water which of itself alone will work, but we must take a
        material, which of itself alone will work, but we must take a
        material, which is much better than Sol or Luna in nature and
        properties, like the person of Christ, to reckon for us, for at
        all times that person shall make whole a number of others, who
        must be nobler and better, and then all will be made whole. As
        long, then, as gold itself is; for the most part, deprived of
        its tincture, and the first Adam must still be the same as
        anyone else, as we also know our own Adam, although in a
        thousand parts not so powerful as his first material of
        tincture, as we are or become men not unlike the first Adam
        prior to his fall, since likewise on account of sin the ordinary
        Sol cannot be a tincture. It was then, before forming a
        tincture, itself tinctured by its first tincture, the nature of
        which lies in this thousand virtues and is to be counted against
        the ordinary Sol. </p>
      <p>The same material or Sol is needed in order to begin our work.
        We must search for it and take it from trees and roots, from
        which Sol is obtained, to which all philosophers direct us,
        above all others, Paracelsus, who is referred to in the Book of
        Minerals. When alchemists wish to find mercury, sulfur, and sal
        salis, as they then wanted to find the tree of gold and its
        roots, where they might be obtained chiefly, they should know
        that it is the proper Mercury, sulfur, and sal solis which
        generates the Sol at that point. In short I presume herewith,
        through sufficient fundamentals and preservation of the Word of
        God, and through additional understandings of false alchemists,
        together with their unreliable processes and anticipated results
        from their entirely inaccurate fundamental concepts, to be
        sufficiently answered. From this it then follows that their
        other numerous assumptions are not valid, since their
        presuppositions are not warranted. And, whether or not, from
        time to time something of value was found in their processes, it
        is nevertheless then according to the writings of Paracelsus
        that these interpretations and opinions constitute more of a
        hindrance than a fathering and even when they are able to
        further advance such a cause, then they can never arrive at the
        origin of it. They have no correct information and are able to
        say nothing about from whence it comes, for when they are asked
        how such a thing could come about, or even how they know that it
        has, or that such is indeed their process, then they are at once
        taken aback and can no longer guess if it is true or not, I can
        not say with certainty how their answer comes about, for indeed
        I do not know. I have also found it described and indeed have
        labored over the problem of being able further to indicate
        approval, or even their rationale, according to nature, since it
        might be regarded as cheap, for often they were the objects most
        labored over in the cinnabar mountain (vitriol, antimony,
        sulfur, and similar metallic objects) which contain within
        themselves many times solar spirits, which are formed during the
        birth of such mineral in the veins of the earth, in which also
        the Primum Ens Solis (initial appearance of the Sun) is not
        wholly completed and continuous, but often completes the same
        operations, although they no longer are of the same species.
        Thus, also, is their Art brought to an end, for then they are
        able to transmute nothing, and so they are entrapped again, and
        no longer are they able to transmute nothing, and no longer are
        they are able to arrive at a conclusion. As a result of such
        erroneous ideas, they can even lead themselves astray thereby,
        and seem always to be getting into trouble, until they are
        entirely ruined and die as a result thereof, for which the
        beautiful Art must take the responsibility unjustly, since it is
        unreasonable to expect them to bray about their own folly. </p>
      <p>Such particulars, however, admonish me, just as do the grim
        Reaper and the deceased Bucher, for they were carried out by
        Sinners who are now dead, and through the same intercession will
        the State of Blissfullness be attained. To err is also of the
        head, just as the correctly prepared tincture, which is Jesus
        Christ. They bind themselves to the foul body of sins, but even
        as their faith is, so also will it be with the tincture, even
        though now and then, though such superstitions as theirs no
        doubt something advantageous will take place, or be helped, and
        even miracles can occur and one can learn, in truth, that the
        Devil can also sometimes perform miracles, so that it,
        nevertheless, comes to pass to the same men that they are
        deluded and are therewith in such an ungodly state that they are
        only able to wade into sinfulness that is even deeper and in the
        end they are completely undone and, to a certain extent, filled
        by the Devil. </p>
      <p>Likewise, it also happens with such persons, who dare to
        attempt such important things that neither God nor Nature, nor
        even they themselves, are able to comprehend either the
        beginning or the end, about which they are also no longer able
        to obtain anything truthful and will also, along with the Art
        that they practice, come to no good end. </p>
      <p>Summarizing, such things will have the effect of giving notice
        of the proper nature, that is, the actual character of a Sophist
        who, indeed, in reality, seeks nothing and finds nothing. To
        conclude further, however, as one reads of those who have
        acquired a rather true knowledge of the Art, who diligently
        studies the First Chapter of Genesis, where God spoke: Let the
        earth bring forth grass and plants, which will reproduce
        themselves, and bear fruit, and each bear fruit after its own
        kind, and have its own seed after its own kind of earth. God
        also spoke to all creatures, as the entire chapter shows, and
        the context enumerates. </p>
      <p>Who is now in such things a fool --- he who resists the
        ordinances of God and masters Nature on he who makes a great
        effort to do God’s Will? He who would like to witness lynching
        and restore vileness and ugliness? He who would sow lead, tin,
        iron and copper as seed crops? And plants gold and silver in the
        ground. Paracelsus says: "That which a man sows, that shall he
        also reap". If you pant gold, then you will reap gold, but
        living seeds of gold are those that must be sown just as God and
        Nature created them and has given them to you before your very
        eyes. We cannot create the seeds, but Nature has already created
        them. We only plant the seeds, like the farmer does, and thus
        from a single ear of corn many hundreds or even a thousand ears
        can grow, and we see the same phenomena in all of God’s
        creatures, that is, each brings forth its own kind and increases
        in its own manner. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I wish to say to you that the entire Art stands
        as a recognition of current materials and their solution. He who
        knows both of these ideas knows the secret of the entire Art.
        But for greater facility, less trouble, and lower costs, seldom
        can be found or understood, for the Art will then be absolutely
        so easy, as philosophers say, that it is a woman’s work and
        children’s play, and also we need nothing more than fire and
        nitrogen, and this is the material which is the same as the gold
        of the philosophers, as I have already previously described in
        sufficient detail, through natural preservation; what is, will
        be. The operations of this Art, however, involve calcinations,
        putrefaction, solution, distillation, coagulation, and
        preparation of the tincture, with the operations of coagulation
        and putrefaction covering a period of&nbsp; 40-42 days, before
        the blackness appears, and then solution in 70 days, whereupon
        it appears white. Coagulation and Fixation occur in 120 days,
        and thereupon the product becomes completely white, i.e., it is
        the finished tincture which after 40 days becomes quite stable
        to fire. At that point a redness appears, so that approximately
        3 months and a few days are required for this work, which is
        then augmentation initially of 10 parts, the second of 100
        parts, and the third of 1000 parts, and gradually by another 10
        times greater through solution and coagulation with acrid water,
        according to the writing s of Aristotle: "Through solution and
        coagulation we increase its virtue. Solution is that which
        necessitates, the true power is not of concern here, while
        solution is at the center of the operation of our thesaurus".
        Moreover, one sees that the entire work involves nothing more
        than solution and coagulation with acrid water, while working in
        water containing Aqua Mercurii communis, Aceto, Quinta Essentia
        Vini, or the like, which are not at all suitable for other work.
        Then we are able to see and know that, since the metals
        increase, the nature of these things shows that they need
        nothing at all. Still there will be found those whose nature we
        must reasonably follow, as they will have it and make it
        necessary. Also dissolution, according to the writings of the
        philosophers: "Bring salt and metal together without corrosive
        materials, and without danger, and red and white fumes will then
        result". You should also say, "Nature of natures, take your
        course; nature of natures, undergo change; nature of natures,
        follow to a conclusion; nature of natures, adjust to the
        result". </p>
      <p>We understand that the farmer requires nothing other than seeds
        and soil, and there must be adequate rain and fertilizer, like
        that which is equivalent to nature’s supply. Consequently, he
        ploughs the field and sowed it and then allowed the sum and
        nature to take its course, which causes it to sprout without any
        further additions. </p>
      <p>Also, moreover, when we have such Seminal Metals and their
        Seeds, then we seed them in it and allow the sun to mature them.
        And during that time we have intense heat, then the sun can give
        by spending itself for a year what the sun might not be able to
        do in many hundreds of years. It is also true that it follows
        that the farmer who sows no seeds will have no crops; therefore,
        if we sow no salt, alum, cinnabar, sulfur, lead, tin, iron,
        copper, gold, or silver, but the philosophic, living natural
        gold, with creates the same nature and presents before your very
        eyes, after going immediately to work and then following all the
        needs of nature, requires such instrumentalities as nature has
        in the soil, and as a result we do not need as many instruments
        as the fool might presume, but with an oven and a few
        instruments we can bring along the entire process from beginning
        to end. And no special work is required, as Count Bernard has
        reported that we heat the bath for the King, who rules over all
        evil men on earth, indeed even as a child of 6 years might be
        able to do, even though it occurs only once, but how and when no
        man is to be found sinful, then the philosophers have
        sufficiently described all the absolute necessities of Art of
        this type up to the power of the fire, which becomes evident
        from the color of the material in the fire, and must be
        recognized. And how much of the Art, which is the easiest thing
        on earth, even for children, so that they may laugh on account
        of it and that old folks seek it so foolishly, so that it is,
        nevertheless, the most difficult thing on earth to be found and
        also it is with such small costs to be achieved, that the entire
        work, when we have understood that for which we have sought,
        would not cost more than three thalers. </p>
      <p><b>David Beuther’s Appendix to the Exalted Art of Alchemy ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>First of all, while we know that under all the planets and
        stars, the Sun is the hottest and most radiant in degree, and
        also that all the planets receive their light from the Sun,
        which planets are also able to, by their brightness, illuminate
        the entire firmament in the upper and lower spheres, warming all
        things that formerly were cold, and then, through the influence
        of the mighty Sun, whose force and effect led to the birth of
        gold which we refer to as Our Sun. Then, just as the Sun
        operates in its realm, it also becomes our Sun here below in
        earth. Then God placed Fire on the Sun in the sky, by which the
        excellence and the power began to have their effect; moreover,
        God has given alchemists and men of power and might, which
        kindle the earthy Sun, which give the inferior planets and the
        metals their luster and brightness and which assert the
        mightiness of the spirit of man through the Word, as God Himself
        said: "Let us make man in a form which will be like us, and he
        shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of
        the air, and over all the beasts of the field, and over the
        whole earth, and over all the reptiles, which crawl upon the
        earth". So men had now received the commandment from the Lord to
        rule, as well, over the metals, according to the Word, since God
        had said: "Have dominion ove the whole earth and everything
        which is above it and below it". Also, men will, from the time
        thenceforth, have dominion over the Sun and its erring path,
        which can sustain the gold and bend others to its will and
        pleasure, as did Joshua by his commanding, since he had routed
        his enemy, that the Sun stands still, signifying that it is
        possible for men to accomplish all things, when they obtain from
        God the wisdom and understanding to do it, so he also received
        the same with assurance in everything which he wanted to do,
        just as happened to King Solomon, insofar as he believed it only
        necessary for the glory of God and for his next task. And that
        is also to be considered for the might of alchemists and to cut
        off the presumed argument of ignorant fools who say that metals
        will be propagated to men from God by transplantation, so that
        it is considered to be a patently false art, which none can
        practice or have knowledge on how to carry on. For the metals do
        not grow like other things, for God has created just so much of
        the same in the mountains as there should be, and no more; for
        this reason must it also be brought forth with great toil and
        difficulty. Oh, you stupid fool, to whom apply God’s ordinances
        and omnipotent words, which in the beginning He spoke to all
        creatures, in which He said: "Be fruitful and multiply". These
        words God spoke not only to living animals and to crops, but to
        slimy creatures and beasts of prey, which you see very day in
        the coarse dust, which increase by self-propagation, and for
        this reason you believe it to be true. However, there are
        others, that you are able to come to know only by alchemy; then
        in this, put your hand to the flail, thresh out the grain, which
        you sow from year to year, and so you will remain an unskilled
        toiler with a crude flail, all the while having faith in
        nothing, holding only for certain your clenched fist and will
        have learned nothing more than what the flail tells you, being
        able to handle it only, or to grasp it with your coarse mind of
        a beast of burden, since you do not know anything else than
        hands to be put to work to clean out stables, or to put manure
        on the field, and you yourself don’t even know the place on
        purpose why you should do that, or that the manure gives quality
        to the field, so that the seed sown in the earth can propagate
        and you are unable to understand that both the seed and the
        manure must undergo putrefaction and in this way enter into the
        composition of earthly bodies and remain these only as the
        Quinta Essentia, <i>vel Virtus regenerative</i> (the
        quintessential regenerative principle), the same principle which
        considers the earth to be its mother, in the same way that the
        straw eaten by animals becomes manure, while the seeds, which
        are sown also become food for animals, and the horses and the
        oxen eat it and, after digesting it in their stomachs, eliminate
        the waste material, and in this way the straw, sooner or later,
        is converted into manure. And during the time everything in the
        stomach of animals is undergoing digestion in the stomach of
        Mother Earth, so that all earthly nature is, and so remains, the
        Quinta Essentia, and the force behind all these changes and from
        all these many processes coming together in the earth, where
        every one of them takes pace, much goodness results and other
        things are invigorated and improved and as a result the earth
        becomes fruitful and productive, and the good seed can bring
        forth a good harvest, just as a wife when she becomes pregnant
        beings a new child into the world. When it then receives a new
        personality. Such cases, however, will be to you a matter of
        instinct. Thus you go about seeding the field, but even as a
        blind donkey can find the manger and knows very well who has
        produced the fodder for him, nevertheless, you want things which
        are much too high for you and which will destroy you, and leave
        you full of doubt, so that you will know neither the beginning
        nor the end, and it might not even be possible for the
        experienced alchemist to transmute metals, even though God has
        given you the blessing of children to bear witness to this fact
        which, due to your inability to appreciate this, remain
        completely hidden from you, so that you yourself do not
        understand what a great accomplishment it is, nevertheless (even
        though man is the greatest of all God’s creatures) to be able to
        transmute metals. Now, no children ever came into the world,
        when you did not need an alchemist, but you attached great
        importance to the wife (as the receptacle of the sol in which
        the seed was implanted by you and nourished to perfection for
        you). Should you then not have the power to rule, as God has
        decreed, that you should then not have the power to rule, as God
        has decreed, that you should, by ruling over a great many lesser
        things, to keep all such things under your feet. But you blind
        ox, you don’t see very well, and you are going to be an uncouth
        fool and back yourself into a hard place. It is also in your
        stupid head to find so little understanding that you cannot
        perceive the wonderful works of God and for this reason there
        must also be in your brain something that is impossible to do.
        There are then metals upon which a growing nature cannot act,
        although the Word of God is spoken as well for them as for all
        creatures: "Be fruitful and multiply", each of you, and it will
        remain proper and well with you, as long as the world remains,
        as also is the case with the Word of God, Have dominion over
        everything that is on earth and remain unbroken in spirit, for
        this is sufficient to undertake the alchemist’s Art and the
        possibility of also transmuting metals through the use of God’s
        Word, which confirms it, and no one can be able to refute this
        statement. </p>
      <p>If, however, you wish t end this discussion and think that such
        is not the case, then you will seldom reach a proper conclusion
        or will find that the deceivers will be so may who go around
        with false and illogical arts and count all alchemists as one to
        the benefit of the Devil, so do not expect to judge as a
        teacher, but rather as a fool, for it will be seen that not all
        cooks which carry the measuring vessels are also not alchemists,
        which spend all their energies in such endeavors, but the
        understanding of God and Nature, and they know what lies hidden
        in Limbo Terrae (for which see Paracelsus in <i>Aurora</i>,
        Chapter 16, of the Universal Materials of Philosophy), which can
        also come to the aid of Nature, and can also make good the
        defects of the same through the art about which others only
        dream, while they let themselves seem to be those, who carry
        mountains of gold in their heads and have each one of them found
        an old catatonic state where a slovenly person, known as a
        student in a laboratory, has made up and set in motion a process
        which proceeds initially as follows: Recipe, originally in code
        but now deciphered, following a pattern of usage, according to
        which children of the streets follow a fool, who goes ahead of
        them with a pipe and will suppose that it is a certain that by
        leaping up and down he has attained a good conception of the
        true art, and still it was held to be so well hidden that no one
        must see it and when they finally take it in hand then they will
        find themselves deceived, even by one another, and, yes, it is
        true, they are even able to dare to undertake for themselves
        Strohschneiger and Hudelmann’s versions of the glorious work of
        alchemy, which is neither contrary to God or to Nature, nor to
        one’s own knowledge; not to mention the fact that they should
        have knowledge of the production of metals, from where they
        originate, and how they came into being initially, holding such
        friends of alchemists as rascals and knaves, although an honest
        and candid alchemist, who is also a true philosopher, and knows
        how to test his fundamental knowledge of his art, first, by
        knowing heavenly things, thereafter, through the course of
        Nature, and, finally, by the thing in itself, as such a famous
        philosopher as St Paul was known to be has written in the 15th
        Chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, who you must
        surely not consider to be among the deceivers, </p>
      <p>If you will, however, believe a true alchemist to be a
        deceiver, then see whether his art which he practices compares
        with the Word of God, fruitful by its very nature, and, in the
        third place, the thing that he practices, in which he labors
        hard and long, then as long as the mouth is the informer of the
        heart, so long will your own words make the truth known,
        whether, he is a liar or not. He now says that he will make it
        from lead, tin, or a baser metal, or even from verdigris,
        vitriol, salt or other material of this sort, from which the
        supposed alchemist gives himself the most credit and even thinks
        only too freely that he is a liar who will deceive himself about
        his own accomplishments. For then the Word of God stands there
        before his very eyes, since God has spoken: "Each one produces
        his own kind". In this arrangement, all things and all advances
        in nature must remain within this framework, since what lies
        outside such a framework is the work of deception and lies. If
        now a Sol or Luna wants to grow or undergo transmutation, then
        it must not be sown in filth or vitriol or lead, or other base
        metal, since God has spoken further: "Everything has seeds of
        its own kind, by which it can be propagated; It is very good
        that everything has its own peculiar seed". Thus, each thing in
        its own nature shall multiply and bear its own sort of fruit.
        Thus, in vitriol, lead, etc., so the art of gold is not in gold
        or nature, no seeds of gold or silver are to be found. Just as
        also an owl can never hatch a falcon, although they both are
        birds and, consequently, have some characteristics that they
        share in common, so, too, neither can a man be descended from a
        horse, although it often happens that unnatural births do take
        place by the interbreeding of two very different kinds of
        things, although God has, nonetheless, forbidden such in his
        Commandments, as set down in the 19th Chapter of Leviticus, that
        such things born in this manner should be burned up by fire,
        since they surely are more Sodomitic and diabolical than they
        are human on God-like. Therefore, they also bear the mark of the
        Devil, they are misshapen and deformed, and are unlike other
        animals. While ordinary men bear God’s own image, these
        misshapen beings are not like that at all. Therefore, I say that
        you can recognize liars by the mixing of strange things. Then
        also the old ways say: Like rejoices with like, Nature delights
        in Nature. Nature embraces Nature, joining together things that
        are alike. And adding further: </p>
      <p>Others, not feminine, for they shall give you nonsense, <br>
        Woman melts man, for woman and man are tinctured. <br>
        It is the rule of fire, the fire of Mercury himself, <br>
        By the tribe, twice as much, the Philosophers Stone is esteemed,
        <br>
        In the tribe it is he whom they ask thousands of thousands, <br>
        These three protected, then all volatile material caught <br>
        Others dissolve, add together, and subdue. <br>
        Spirits and all fermented materials of the world, <br>
        And this destroyed the coagulated body itself, <br>
        One, if to exist together, with only the body placed. <br>
        Sun and Moon arise from the colors themselves, <br>
        Male by no means generates women, if not maintained, <br>
        Nor woman prepare men without them. <br>
        If the Sun does not make it ready, if the Moon does not join in,
        <br>
        If only put down, but arising thereupon because it chooses, <br>
        Sun and Moon, seed of Mercury, and whether <br>
        Seed with feminine aspects is joined together with mercury <br>
        For they prepare pleasingly these two bodies born, <br>
        Because origin and prayer will conquer the summit of everything
        <br>
        If fetters if women with the Moon is the goal of realization. </p>
      <p>Now then, that will be enough said about the office of Chemist
        and of Nature, and to confirm the possibility of transmutation
        of metals and how the metals each one, according to the Word of
        God, has its own seed in and of itself, by which it can
        propagate itself and bring forth its own kind, according to its
        own fruit, and in this way you can recognize a true alchemists
        and philosopher, who differentiates himself from an imposter and
        prevaricator by showing that according to God’s Holy Word and
        Divine Plan and the course of the path He chose when in his
        material body, if you are unable to believe the evidence in a
        personal way, then let the Word of God be sufficient fundamental
        truth for you, and your presumed argument to the contrary,
        Similarly, might it not also just be possible to make metals
        likewise propagate? Moreover, when you become worthy of such,
        the evidence will demonstrate it. Since one should not cast
        pearls before swine, as Christ has said, then believe also that,
        without previous trouble, your unbelief and foolish opinions
        will put no roasted pear into your mouth or have no roasted dove
        fly into your mouth. </p>
      <p>So I will now permit myself to digress a bit and proceed
        further with my previous argument, in which I told you that God
        spoke, as follows: "One of every living thing shall reproduce
        its own kind, according to its own nature, and be fruitful, and
        retain its own seed in itself and bring forth according to its
        own kind". So we write of the power of God’s Word to apply as
        well this power also to metals, especially to the highest and
        best from among all of the same, which indeed is our Sun. Shall
        it, however, not also provide brightness and light to the least
        of the planets and must it then be set on fire by the
        alchemist’s reagents on the Earth, even as they are in heaven
        above by God Himself, who is indeed Lord of the Heavens, but has
        given the earth to men, His Children, who have made it over to
        please God, the Father. Now, such an ignition cannot happen by
        any such thing of itself alone, but through its own nature, and
        the essential inflammation, no fire could be found at that time,
        which could be the power, the excellence, and the result of pure
        activity alone, for it will help you to understand the effects
        of the other planets, whether they also are fiery, with their
        heat giving off nothing and taking on nothing, or like the Sun,
        or fire from God, so that the fire and the spirit are the same.
        For this reason also, as long as they are taken by one better
        than it itself is, then they can impart also to others their
        excellence and this will then be a light, which can then provide
        light to everything which is dark and obscure, because if their
        cleanness and ability to light up and make warm, and the other
        planets, which of themselves are the same as dead, can be
        kindled and brought to life and, therefore, on account of their
        supreme majesty, can be compared to God and Christ, which also
        would have given rise to the planets around the Sun, including
        the Planet Jupiter, and the Sign of Leo the Lion, and since,
        moreover, the Sun illuminates everything in the sky above with
        its brightness, and indeed produces the same result in the inner
        spheres, such as gold, minerals, rubies, plants, animals, lions,
        birds, and even men, and also Christ had the proper Sun in all
        its clarity, because of its brilliance and never-failing light
        which it brought and explained it and defined it, and was
        destroyed by inhalations of the Spirit of the Devil, but how
        Christ, both God and man, who was complete, so that we all can
        also be more complete, so that men and creatures have now the
        power, although the power of the Spirit, the Godhead far
        surpasses any power we have of our own. Moreover, the heavenly
        Sun, because of its great cleansing power, can being about more
        than all the stars put together, as also our earthly sun here
        below with us does to metals, and as Christ is the foremost
        among all men, and next to Him we are the noblest of all
        creatures, even better than the angels, for were are created in
        the likeness of Christ, who died to redeem the whole human race
        and has not suffered to let the will of that angel who was cast
        out, and also in earth and heaven, the Moon, and the Sun. To
        rank among the lesser plans, as with respect to Christ, and as
        (Luna Conjunx Solis) the wife towards the man, and by nature so
        completely united, and how very much more is the man than the
        woman, since it was the man who was created first and is thus
        Lord of the woman. In the same way the Sun is Lord of the Moon.
        (Woman was created from the man, so mercury is masculine, while
        sulfur is feminine). From this, then, we conclude that to
        complete our work, as to begin the same, of improving and
        shortening it, no other material should be taken than cinnabar,
        since the metals in vitreous earth are unsatisfactory and thus
        they must be treated with a better, higher, and nobler medicine,
        and the greater the infirmity, the greater the medicine must be,
        so that the healing process and recovery can also be more rapid
        and more complete. The entire operation may be briefly described
        in the following verse, first set down in the handwriting of
        Paracelsus: </p>
      <p>There is a stone and still no stone, <br>
        In which stands the whole art alone, <br>
        It can be found in the ground and mountain <br>
        In which dwell ogres and dwarfs. <br>
        I tell you this of a truth and as a favor, <br>
        He who has this same thing has only a vapor. </p>
      <p>And the splendor of the red lion, <br>
        Extracted mercury, completely pure and clean, <br>
        The same sulfur, I saw of a truth, <br>
        Had the rudiments of the art so completely. </p>
      <p><b>Raymond Lully in His <i>Vademecum</i> (Guidebook):</b> </p>
      <p>The tincture was extracted along with out Sol, which you can
        easily understand, so that you can read our book without
        annoyance, and can go and do your work more safely.
        Consequently, the following things are required for higher
        study; a better understanding, reliable information, hands ready
        to work, avoiding sophists, free and unhindered employment,
        sufficient ability, and means and a good philosophy. Bucher had
        them all. </p>
      <p><b>Johannes Daustenius Anglic:</b> </p>
      <p>Cook the little man and woman together, until both become hard
        and dry. When they are not dry, different colors will not
        appear. Cause: the color will always be black as long as
        moisture is present. </p>
      <p><b>Item Daustenius:</b> </p>
      <p>It is very fortunate that Nature will react according to
        well-established patterns, in which most substances are not
        completely destroyed by too much heat or lack of heat. Thus,
        when Nature reacts too vigorously or too little, but otherwise
        as I ought, then it destroys directly and that is not the same,
        consequently, as that which one would have wished. </p>
      <p>In honor of the King and Queen, however, and indeed not burning
        them, for they did not flee therefrom on account of the intense
        heat. So, then, it is for you to be patient and long-suffering,
        which improves the Kind and his Queen in the government.&nbsp;
        Cook them until they become black, and afterwards white, and
        then red, and then this will become an actual medicine, which
        gives its tincture to gold. </p>
      <p>Whereas our ore originally became dissolved the more it was
        heated and became a volatile liquid, after that the more it was
        heated, the thicker it became, turning into a very white powder.
        In the third place, the more it was heated the more colored it
        became, until it become a tincture with a deep red color and the
        entire operation was reduced to a process as simple as the
        extraction of water from an ore and then decanting the resulting
        liquid from the ore. There must, however, be a diligent
        watching, a continuous confidence. Thereupon, the whole thing
        will become self-explanatory and will also finally turn out to
        be to your liking. </p>
      <p><b>David Beuther’s Philosophical and Chemical Writings ~</b> </p>
      <p>To God Alone the Glory. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: By what means should one dissolve the body of
        the Sun and the body of the Moon? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Through your own water or key. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: What is your key? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: It is your own mercury. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: What is your mercury? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: It is a metallic liquid which is an inner vapor
        of minerals, which is completely volatile so that it can also
        disappear into the air and diffuse into the air and after
        sublimation it is referred to as the Water of the Discerning,
        you spring and fountain, as well as your fire, for then your
        Philosophers’ Water is actually a fire. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Where must one seek to find this Water? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: In the mountains and in the ground and in a
        large of minerals. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: In which minerals? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: In those minerals in which the spirits of metals
        reside. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Are all of them good? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Yes, but all of them are different. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Why is that? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Because? If they will al arise from a single
        root, then, however, nothing can be extracted without gold and
        silver; no tincture can be produced from itself alone. They can
        all be converted into a tincture of a medicine, but one of them,
        however, is very much nobler and better then the others. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Why is that? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: The reason is that one of them is not equal in
        quality to the others in the stars above and in the celestial
        world in the embodiment of their influence. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Which of them, however, has the greatest
        ability from God to act as a tincture? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: There are indeed many spirits which under such
        circumstances do have the power to give metals a special color.
        These are the spirits of metals residing in a great many mineral
        ores. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: What are such minerals good for? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Indeed there are many uses. For one such metal
        has the spirit of the other six in it. But the most important
        spirits, however, are those of silver and gold, which live in
        base metals, such as cobalt, zinc, bismuth, antimony, and the
        various forms of garnet. The highest of all of them, then, are
        gold and silver ores and from them the noble water might come
        when they are found in an entirely natural and pure state. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Which are the best and most serviceable? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: The most dilute and volatile ores and minerals,
        since they lead to the spirits of the Sun and Moon. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Do these spirits have more ability as a
        tincture than others do? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Yes, indeed. Certainly far more. Since they
        actually surpass the others in their ability to become fixed,
        and in their stability, and also they surpass them in
        volatility. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: In which minerals are ordinarily found the
        spirits of gold and silver in the greatest quantity? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: As you have desired to know the origin and the
        source, then you will see that the spirit of gold and silver is
        pure, unmixed with other living spirits, and you will also see
        that silver is the most serviceable for it is (even when
        unrefined) pure, ductile, bright, volatile, and the lower the
        silver content the better, since the red-gold ores used are
        broken into gold and cobalt. Among others, cobalt is often
        found, which leads to a little silver, if indeed any whatsoever.
        Then after digging in a mine, a white, soothing coagulated
        liquid or liquor of the moon is found, which is formed partially
        from actual cobalt and tends to increase in amount and is
        inclined to be oily, like melted fat, or even a little pasty, or
        is like a soft, delicate, white painter’s color. In this liquid,
        however, lies our liquor, hidden, from the moon, for us to labor
        over. When, however, such liquor appears to give a mineral a red
        color, then this leads to the Spirit of mars, even if, however,
        it becomes green, like the Spirit of Venus. This spirit becomes
        separated from its ore by spagyric methods, so that it has
        within it the life of the earth, although this spirit has also
        separated the pure from the impure by the process of
        sublimation, or, in another way, by the process of extraction,
        carried out with rather vigorous extraction and the addition of
        silver, leading to artificial flowers of lapidi and tinctures
        resulting from their solution. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: How is this spirit driven away and separated
        from its crude earthiness or terrestrial nature? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: In order that you can accurately separate the
        pure from the impure and obtain each of them separately, you
        must now take the liquorish water containing the gold and silver
        and place it in an efficient sublimation apparatus or an earthen
        vessel where it is then sublimed in a sand bath, using a vessel
        made of iron and tin, and allowed to react slowly for several
        hours and then, according to the opportunity, the longer, the
        stronger, the spirit rises very gently through the neck of the
        still head or retort into the other globe glass and is even
        allowed to remain there, the metals being identified by their
        colors. </p>
      <p>Then, take an ore and bring the spirit therefrom. You must tap
        it gently, so that the spirit can rise easily and go out of it.
        Or, take the mineral ores of gold and silver, crude or pure, in
        pieces or entire, carefully pulverized by rubbing on a stone,
        then hermetically sealed in a vial, melted, and then allowed to
        sit in a sand bath and made completely soft, compact and fixed,
        so that the gold becomes heavy and is covered over with a green
        skin, which looks like the leaf of a nut tree and is spoken of,
        as is the custom, as the Green Dragon of Hermes, or as the Green
        Corrosive (Omnivorous) Snake, or as the Green Lion, although
        Theophrastus called it the Tree Frog, imbibing an air of wisdom
        and coating his back with wax; but in reality, it is the White
        Lily, the water of the Wise, for from it comes the Elixir of
        Life, and the Fountain of Youth. When now this Liquor of the Sun
        is drawn out from the resin colored blood and the green tree
        frog is covered over with, making him so hot that his skin will
        burst, and from him, after he does indeed burst, comes our Lily,
        which grows even snow-white, like wool. Let it grow as long as
        it can. Take this with an instrument of gold, finely
        constructed, and when you have enough of the same, then continue
        the experiment in a spherical vessel which is formed like a
        round-bottomed flask and sealed, and its contents allowed to
        putrefy in our Athanor oven, made of brass, so that one can
        carry the experiment out in a dish or whatever he chooses. It is
        approximately one span and a half wide, well made of good iron
        or copper, like figures with two cupels, in which putrefaction
        takes place in a very mild heat, with very mild sweating, with
        low heat over a period of a month, resulting in a black color,
        then a white one. This is our Fountain and our Soil, in which is
        found that which you will harvest --- the Corpus Solis et Lunae
        (Body of the Sun and Moon), which can be further purified. After
        this stage of purification, more gold was added and the mixture
        was allowed to putrefy further. This is done as often and as
        extensively as desired. There is, consequently, a certain
        considerable amount of increasing the amount of ore. So milling
        takes place nine times, putrefaction occurring at each step. You
        must see the blackness, reminding you that you have to correctly
        solve the problem and must make certain that, when necessary,
        the gold must be added to the mercury. When all of this is now
        in solution, and then added to its own ferment, and heated for a
        long period of time with one another, until it is unchanging
        (that is to say, the gold or its ferment --- the gold or silver
        added as a leaven, so that its ferment is volatile and the
        volatile part, the mercury, is unchanging) and it was formerly
        considered a tincture, although not now. </p>
      <p>The following involves three kinds of solar liquors which are
        very serviceable to the Philosophers’ Fountain: </p>
      <p>The first is called gold pyrites, which is entirely pure by
        itself and leads to no other foreign metallic spirit or any
        highly corrosive substance. The other is the crude and scaly
        form of hematite, which, however, must be pure. This is the most
        stable and durable Mineral of the Sun, whose greatest value is
        seen in a noble medicine comparable to the noble mineral,
        antimony, in which the Spirit of the Sun and moon may be readily
        dissolved to form a medicine. </p>
      <p>In the third place, there is still the Mineral of the Sun,
        which is a liquor or water in very solid gold-cobalt, gold
        pyrites, or gold quartz, which is very mild and delicate in its
        first composition. It is found to have a red color and appears
        to be like a cinnabar ore. This is the Sugar of Theophrastus,
        which he mentions in his Thesaurus to act like gold, and with
        this mineral, the Sap of Gold is brought to the fountain and
        allowed to undergo change (as formerly pointed out with the
        Mineral of the Moon). This is now the threefold Mercury of the
        Philosophers, which is, however, its ferment, actually a very
        beautiful pure gold oxide, to which when a gold liquor was added
        and allowed to putrefy, a black material was obtained, so that
        the Green Dragon (which is simply mercury) which has been
        extracted from the mineral and blended with the Anatron Sol,
        which is actually the Lion of Gold, or gold oxide, which
        immediately turns it into the mercury and then into a double
        mercury. This is now the true mercury of the philosophers, which
        dissolves all substances if enough is added. When all this is
        finished, as all of the Philosophers have noted, the two waters
        unite to form one. In this white water, the substance dissolves
        to form the perfect solution, which becomes coagulated when
        acted upon by its first ferment until it, in its turn, becomes
        white, as well as non-flammable and indestructible, and even
        though it is actually fixed and stable as a White Tincture, it
        must, nevertheless, be further treated until it gives a red
        tint, at which point it is even better fixed and is then able to
        dye everything from white and can be looked upon further until
        finally, the deepest shades of red appear. Continuing this
        process and others, such as steadily heating over an open flame,
        produces no change, although a brightness is imparted to the
        flame, which first turns gold, then red, and finally a deeper
        red, but the substance itself is non-combustible, which is its
        most notable characteristic, since fire only serves to make it
        more stable. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: How many changes, then, can this Stone bring
        about? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: Two. The first is putrefaction; the second is
        fermentation. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Then how does fire cause it to increase? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>:&nbsp; The increase occurs in the metal. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: How can the gold cause it to become tinctured
        and make it better, since it was previously pure enough? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: It makes it like a tincture and a lapidi, which
        thereafter is much more penetrating and its activity is
        increased so that 1 part per 100 parts of material can bring
        about the same amount of uniform coloring and can turn out more
        gold. </p>
      <p><i>Question</i>: Is there then no mineral on earth that this
        material cannot cause to be tinctured? </p>
      <p><i>Answer</i>: None. Of that which you have seen as the proper
        basis and, as I have previously suggested, all metals have
        originated from a single root stock and thus all can be brought
        to a single tincture of white and red (although the assistance
        of gold and silver are required). So you now know, and can
        imagine even, what kinds of metals are best suited, the most
        powerful and the mightiest, and you will soon discover the gold,
        silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, and lead all have a single
        root or Mercurium. When occurring alone in a metal or mineral
        this ore is purer in mercury and is easier to bring out of its
        ore and also easier to purify than are the others. In this way,
        you will know, however, that mercury, while still in its ore, is
        also a very beautiful red color, resembling that of a ruby.
        Indeed, this mineral is also finely powdered and comes from its
        ore very readily, as mercury also comes from its gold ore, even
        more rapidly than other forms of mercury. The gold and silver in
        their original state can bring it out and make it similar to
        mercury. This is the only difference in the form of the minerals
        reported, that is, whether they all will have one kind of
        mercury and stem from a single root or a mercury before them
        will be sufficiently shaped solely by other characteristics.
        However, through the poisonous vapors in the pockets
        interspersed in the earth so that mercury from a mineral having
        another spirit might lead to a mercury of such a nature that it
        can be purified easier than the others and thus one sees in such
        a one this fact in the sublimation process, since the mercury is
        often in four different colors, all of which are spirits driven
        thereinto. On account of this, no mercury dissolves the metal.
        Then it will be that false colors and impure spirits will be
        separated and removed. The mercury, however, from the living
        mercury ore is volatile and is even the most volatile of all
        minerals and, also, without a single thing, except a very gentle
        heat, not alone for the purpose of driving it from its ore, but
        also (by such a gentle heat) to readily purify and refine it
        and, moreover, that it might equally have such strength and
        other good qualities as the preceding do not have. And when it
        now has also been made as completely pure as a crystal as a
        result of sublimation, then it dissolves much more readily than
        other minerals, such as mercury, gold, and silver, and combines
        with them, so that this is a true saying, "Prepare mercury from
        mercury solution, without ordinary mercury ores". But
        Philosophers say, "Thus you see that mercury ore attacks the
        metallic nature of all kinds of metals and fuses them together
        and, for this reason, you can also believe that it can do that
        to its mercury even more readily". When the spirit of the pure
        gold is added to such a rapidly heated mercury, then it makes
        the gold like the mercury, too, and so one can proceed with the
        other ores, as previously taught, to prepare tinctures from
        other metallic ores, thereby leading to mercury or the spirit of
        the gold. For this reason, nothing is bound to any one certain
        mineral, since from one such, as from the other, a mercury is
        obtained. Then a convenient process will result, which can then
        be utilized. It is also to be noted that whether indeed a
        mineral containing mercury taken from Nature or from another
        source that can be repurified like the other, then we must now
        take such a mineral, as Theophrastus taught, namely the Electrum
        Minerale Immaturatum (which is such a noble metal) which by
        itself has no other foreign nature, then as long as the spirit
        of the metal will be of many kinds, many kinds of processes must
        also be required to refine the same. In pursuance of this, I
        will now consider the philosophical work to follow hereafter. In
        the Name of the Holy Trinity and to the Glory thereto be given.
        Amen. </p>
      <p><b>Philosophical Work ~</b> </p>
      <p>Since the metals in the veins of the earth will be very impure,
        they must be treated by a very high and noble course of
        medicine, and then will be cured. The more persistent the
        illness, the more vigorous the medicine that will be required.
        Thus, for our Work, there is nothing better than can be taken
        than the labeled material and for that we must go to the Tree of
        Gold, as Theophrastus has shown us and has also stated in his
        book on the Minerals. </p>
      <p>The old alchemists knew how to find sulfur and mercury from the
        Sun and how in the Tree of Gold and its roots he could indeed
        find it, and might even be able to obtain it cheaply, for the
        same, namely, salt, sulfur, and mercury, which is mercury,
        produce gold there. They also talked about a Tinctura
        Physicorum, in which the old Spagyrists before them had withheld
        controversial and tedious work, since they had obtained a much
        easier and better route where they had learned about the
        Astronomiae Concordance on unanimous opinion of the alchemists,
        in which Theophrastus speaks about the Lion: "Take now his
        ruby-colored blood and from the Eagle the whiten gluten, and
        after you have coagulated the two together, in this way you have
        obtained the Tincturea Physicorum". What the Red Lion was,
        however, he said --- at that time and in that same place ---
        only with obscure words, and there he described the Subjectum
        Materiae, saying in these words: "The material of the Tincture
        is a thing which you understand correctly from the Spagyrists,
        which come from one of two Arts taken from the Vulcani (the
        Shining One)", and might so still remain as I told you about in
        his correct terms, according to the old customs, and even that
        it is the Red Lion, named by many but known by few. Now, the
        same may be transmuted through the help of Nature and the skill
        of the artisan in works of the White Eagle, and also, that from
        a single one, two will result, over which the golden brilliance
        does not subsequently lighten the Spagyric over the two, viewed
        as one. If you do not know what the requirements of the ancient
        astronomers and the customs of the old cabalists (i.e., mystics)
        are, then you either report for further enlightenment through
        oral communication or else elect to look into the Arts of Vulcan
        through God’s help or that of Nature. So much has been said
        about this, as Paracelsus would say that he used the short way
        of preparing the tincture from the materials from which all this
        should be made. It is so clearly described that those who do not
        understand it will not even be able to guess anything further
        and are unable to declare it clearly with their mouths. And
        although it is true that it is given to understand sufficiently
        the as wisdom, so it will nevertheless be imprudent, and even
        more foolish, to never learn from this during one’s own
        lifetime. Thus, from the start, it was indicated clearly enough
        what the material is from which the tincture should be made and
        is stated in this way on the basis of one thing alone, and that
        is, that one needs nothing more than this (just as also the
        entire soul stands alone in Christ) and should say: "It is and
        is called the Red Lion". Where, indeed, we seek the same and
        shall find it, he says, in the Tree of Gold and its roots, since
        he leads us actually to the one mountain, which is nothing other
        than the actual Red Lion, and then to that which is no other
        metal or metallic spirit by itself than the cherished Spirit of
        Gold. And he, indeed, clearly and properly talks about the fact
        that in order to demonstrate these words, he said the following:
        "The Red Lion can be transmuted into the White Eagle, so that
        the one can become two, and moreover that gold with all its
        brilliance cannot lighten up the spagyric". </p>
      <p>Note well, the word "Gold" and all its brilliance, of which he
        speaks and by which he means nothing else than the
        above-mentioned material, and not the ordinary melted gold,
        proving from this that, since he has directed us to go to the
        Tree of Gold and its roots, the metals increased, and also in
        his Archidoxa, as well as his little book on Renovation and
        Restoration, he said that the gold, indicated in the thousandth
        part, is not so powerful when melted by the furnace as in its
        ore, for as soon as this is done, the salt, sulfur and mercury
        are gone away. He also pointed this out in his manual. For this,
        we should take Erlectrum minerale immaturatum, that is, the most
        noble of metals. An item in the little book Electro-Minerals
        says that from the purer metals, nothing is retained of the art
        of alchemy. And in his Metamorphoses he also says the same thing
        about active gold and silver. Rodangionus, in his little book on
        Signs of the Zodiac, writes that the art of Alchemy is not to be
        sought or found in metals which are of poor quality and inferior
        and, so also, will nothing be found in small minerals. Arnold of
        Villanova in his <i>Alchemical Speculations</i> points out that
        in no minerals of inferior quality and not even in ordinary gold
        and silver, and not even in other lesser things, can alchemical
        arts be found, excepting those in which the gold is the best
        possibility and satisfies the symbols of cinnabar, that is, it
        is in the Red Lion. Theophrastus also wrote about such materials
        in his <i>Alchemists’ Thesaurus</i>, as follows: "We find in
        the veins of the earth a mineral which, in its first
        coagulation, appears to be red in color and in it lies sealed
        all the flowers and colors of the minerals, as well as the good
        qualities of all metals, and what might be the same in all of
        them, that is, in this single thing", and noted as such in the
        same sort of cinnabar ore, for the appearance and color are
        almost entirely the same. With this, it is shown not only in the
        daylight what the material is like, but also it indicates what
        kind of stock we should search for and what kind of metallic
        seeds we should find. Note well, the gold and silver produce
        such seeds, which subsequently tend to grow and to increase. In
        Arrige Aures Pamphile all these words are noted and confirmed by
        Berhardus, Geber, Alani, Raymond Lully, and many others. Now,
        this is enough of the review of those works, the material from
        which we shall take. </p>
      <p>If we now wish to proceed further, we must now go on to
        Paracelsus’ School of Work and to the brief passages which
        follow, as are readily to be noted and learned from his <i>Scriptis</i>.
        Then we desired to learn from the <i>Subjectum Materiae vel
          Tincturae</i>, which is reported clearly enough and shown with
        the fingers, so he also set up thereby the welcome preparations
        and said that from one (of the materials noted) two would
        result, namely, sulfur and mercury, since one of them (mercury)
        gives the body, on earth, wherein we plant the seeds, i.e., the
        Sulfur of the Sun, which sulfur is called the Blood of the Red
        Lion, while the mercury is called the Gluten of the White Eagle.
        He further stated that when the two coagulated together, then
        the tincture thus prepared was ready to be used. This is,
        indeed, a shorter way of preparation, though it gives poorer and
        inferior results. In addition, he said that, however, this
        required the services of a well-experienced artisan to serve as
        Fire master. What a figment of the imagination! </p>
      <p>Now, however, everyone might like to know how to make from one
        (of the materials noted) two different materials and bring seed
        from the earth and afterwards sow the seeds now and again, so
        that there would be an increase in the fruit brought forth.
        Indeed, he did not set forth any separate process of operation
        therefore, but nevertheless said that those who could not
        understand from his description would be allowed no further
        conjecture and, moreover, that nothing more would be added to
        the Art by God Himself. Thus, it is, however, true that without
        any further instructions, such words would be of such a limited
        understanding that they would be almost too difficult, if not
        impossible, to comprehend and would show further how one should
        proceed with the material. Then, alone would he be able to say
        that the material or the tincture should lead to an
        understanding of the Red Lion, that is, that it is cinnabar, and
        that it is a thing which involves "one in two through the art of
        Vulcan", an understanding of the use of fire and heat and how
        generated and how released from these materials, and how
        sublimation may be brought about, and that I pass it on to you
        with its correct nature and the uses of old, so that it is the
        Red Lion of which much is spoken and little is known. Now, the
        same may, through the help of Nature and the skill of the
        artisan, bring about a transmutation in the White Eagle and
        then, too, may from one (understanding the nature of the
        material) there come two, that is, sulfur and mercury. More than
        that, the brilliant reflection from the gold should not
        illuminate the spagyro. As he would say no more than that, as
        the two principles, sulfur and mercury, are not used to conduct
        the work, but are to be kept in reserve, as in the case of the
        material, which must be only one, and yet, at the same time, may
        be two. In this brief work is explained not only completely the
        material, but also the entire work, beginning, middle, and end;
        and the whole process of preparing the tincture and also the
        complete work, in which the three things are pointed out, first,
        the volcanic action, which was treated by the poets in the case
        of fire, by others as the help of Nature, and by a third group,
        as the skill of the artisan, and through these three means were
        the above-mentioned two things, the sulfur and the mercury, in
        the light made by the Red Lion, caused to happen and terminated
        therewith, saying that beyond the brightness of the gold, the
        artisan was not illuminated. As he was wont to say, not to brig
        the work past that point, either through the help of fire or
        through the skill of the artisan. Then, when the artisan brings
        it so far that he has made sulfur and mercury from the material,
        then he cannot go any further, so he must let God and Nature
        work it out and then await the fruit. Even as the farmer, who
        plants seeds in God’s Name and in God’s Seal and proceeds
        thereupon and God and Nature set about accomplishing the
        results. The artisan must also do his part if he hopes to make
        the two from one. What now, however, the three works and what
        each official or minister of Vulcan or Fire of nature does,
        using the skill of the artisan, I will now explain briefly here
        and clear it all up and further point out what is understood by
        these words, before, however, reporting that us as the Sun in
        its course through the sky, no one else than through his
        reagents, which are actually from God Himself, is lit up
        (enlightened). Men can also see that there is a reagent in this
        case here which ignites our Sun the same as any fire on earth,
        since God and Nature have provided him to enable him to work and
        keep himself alive. So it is true that the heavenly fire from
        the Sun so influences metals that it is up to us a common
        earthly event and involves a solidifying and congealing fire. In
        Heaven, however, this is resolved. If it should come to life,
        however, it must be through its resembling in appearance that
        external fire and such a uniform fire was assumed that it burned
        with a bright flame, which was the spirit of the Fire, and it
        caught fire and had its effect. Since, however, we are not able
        to have the Power of heaven or even bring it down to us, then we
        so needed the Materialistic Fire, which was originally ignited
        by sparks, so that it burns continuously without ever ceasing
        and, as long as it has this same material making it up, and can
        continue to work and by means of the same also acts in metals,
        due to the igniting of an earthly sun, just as also like can be
        brought to life by like. Thus, even if wood contains the Fire
        Principle and is of a combustible nature, still it does not
        catch fire unless ignited, as by sparks. Moreover, since this
        fire is not that of the shining Sun, nor is it that of shining
        gold, it must then be the result of the earthly fire, which is
        ignited by its sparks, so that it also burns and continues to
        burn so long as the same combustible material is added to it, so
        that the one Sun and Light ignites the other, just as the Sun in
        the Firmament of heaven ignites all the other Stars. This
        declares to us, as Theophrastus first noted, by way of volcanoes
        or fire, which the poets have termed the God of Fire or the
        Smithy of God, through which is understood the materialistic
        fire in our oven. However, natural Fire, and Nature herself, has
        in part been suitable to this work, that is, the seeding of
        fire, which so influences the metals, through the heavenly
        impressions and markings that were brought about through our
        fire. And since we here in the world have doubled the heat in
        our work, so we also are able to complete our work in shorter
        time, so that in many years Nature is not able to do it at all.
        The work of artisans is not otherwise than tending fires and
        managing the same, so that the fire will not be too large or too
        small, and this is the Key to the whole work effort. Moreover,
        the sayings of philosophers are filled with this sort of thing
        in which the whole of the Art consists. Fire and Azoth are
        sufficient in themselves, and this is enough to say to you and,
        as various sayings evening the works of the philosopher Bucher
        have noted, putrefaction, rectification, calcining,
        distillation, coagulation, sublimation, incineration, etc., lead
        thereby the foolhardy to conceive that it is everything under
        the heading of the above-mentioned work, which, nevertheless,
        since it is our own, should be considered, in our own words, as
        dictum: "Solvate, coagulate, and pour through a filter bed of
        rocks, which results in the conferring of considerable success".
        And, by this work, you will completely fulfill the sayings of
        the sages, which runs: "Bring Salt to Metal without Corrosive
        Action and Danger, Thus will You have White and Red". </p>
      <p>And now, as Paracelsus has set forth, the entire operation of
        the separation of materials, and as you are about to make two
        from one, by adding only fire, so teach again the same two
        components and say that one should coagulate the blood of the
        Red Lion with the Gluten from the White Eagle, whereupon the
        entire tincture will be ready, thereby showing that the entire
        Art must lie in a single work which will be initiated and
        completed by a single thing, from which it also has the
        designation, "By Universal rules, correct and strict". And as
        the work must be completed in an oven and a vat, and with
        instruments, nevertheless with the changes in the fire
        counteracting the secondary effects. And also, the materials,
        once they are included subsequently in the convenient instrument
        appropriate thereto, the name of which is not given, until the
        tincture is ready, therewith once again if is full of the
        language of philosophers, as follows: "In a vat containing the
        instrument, you can carry it out from beginning to end". Whoever
        has diligently studied Bernhard’s Parable, which states that as
        the King goes alone into his bath and takes none unfamiliar with
        him, and as long as he remains therein, until he comes out a
        blood-red color, and also like all the others, the meanest man
        on earth may be his protector, while no other trouble demands
        further attention than to heat up the King’s bath, he who looks
        after all this diligently, will understand my meaning very well
        and also understand how my words are in agreement with those of
        philosophers. </p>
      <p>Here I call to your attention that you bear in mind what I have
        made known to you in my previous universal work and how
        everything in itself has its own seeds, therewith to propagate
        itself and reproduce its own kind, and how the Red Lion, which
        is cinnabar transmutes itself, according to the words of
        Paracelsus, into the White Eagle, "only by adding fire to
        putrefaction and sublimation into wholesome life", and how, at
        first, the black color appears, and thereafter the white, which
        is indeed the proper White Eagle, actually mercury, and at the
        bottom of the glass vessel remains the blood of the Red Lion and
        it is the "Sulfur of the Sea", which will be extracted through
        its own mercury, although in the same place distinct additional
        mercury will be realized, to work with, to solvate, and to
        coagulate, which involves the older and longer process, so that
        he does not know thereby the proper directions, can overload the
        seed, flood it, and suffocate to death, so that it can bring
        forth no fruit and is no longer, therefore, able to carry out
        its function. Accordingly, so must the work be begun with wisdom
        that the red tincture will be obtained, then the white material
        must be divided into two parts, one to augment and the other to
        reduce, the red. In the short method of production, however, the
        work goes faster and more safely, since all the material
        involved is kept together and treated at the same time, and
        nothing therefrom is obtained thereby unless God and Nature have
        ordained it. Also, it takes mercury, the matter in metals, which
        is mineral, the semen of man, which is sulfur, themselves added
        together, with nothing more, that is all that is necessary, so
        let the powerless alone, for in this way the worker in the field
        cannot easily be deceived, since he has only to look after the
        fire. We have here a good example of the evolution of man quite
        gradually, as the man and the woman often attempt to have a
        child without success, but only at a time when in the first
        conception the man’s seed is productive, while at other times
        all of the other seed is lost. Success occurs only through the
        natural heat of the woman’s body, which matures the seed of the
        man and finally, through the interaction of Nature a fully
        developed living child is obtained. The warmer the child and the
        better the mother of the child provides nourishment for the
        child and carries out her other daily chores, the more perfect,
        the stronger, and the healthier the child will be and the mother
        will remain. </p>
      <p>Here I also have, from the natural understanding of God’s Holy
        Word, and from the evidence gathered by ancient philosophers and
        written about the actual process, so that it can be quite
        clearly recognized, noted that it can be quite clearly
        recognized, noted that it is not otherwise than that the proper
        subject, actually cinnabar, be taken, which is beautifully cut
        like a ruby, as well as in Lecture vz. 8 c., which is found in
        the mines of the Hungarian mountains, in which place Paracelsus
        has also shown us, saying that for our king of work no better
        material can be found than that from Hungary and from Istria.
        Moreover, on Spruce Mountain, near Gold-Granach, where no other
        ore was taken if it did indeed yield up gold, then it would be
        adulterated and impure and not suitable for this kind of
        endeavor, insomuch as the same generally represented two metals
        in one or is, on the other hand, contaminated with other
        metallic "ghosts", so that when this work is completed, a part
        of this well-prepared Tincture of Natural Philosophy is taken,
        along with many hundred parts of each of the imperfect metals,
        which gave the same a more pronounced tincture of real gold in
        an instant than did the natural and so eliminated the entire
        examination, the report, and even all other illnesses that
        medical doctors were unable to cure. However, they were restored
        and then introduced by a new youthfulness which a 60 or 70 year
        old man will also see, which will make him feel like a 20 year
        old youth and many more wonderful blessings than this, which
        have the ability to act as a strength-giving medicine. And how
        such a tincture is to be produced in greater amounts and how it
        is to be administered, and how projections and proposals can be
        brought forth have been reported by me earlier. </p>
      <p>One also sees how the work is brought to completion from a
        material in an oven, glass container, or other type of
        receptacle, in one experiment after another, by using increased
        amounts to heat. And, even though the work and the art by you
        yourself is completely inferior in quality, the philosophers
        have also pointed out "It is wife’s work and children’s play".
        Even so, it still requires a well-qualified artisan to be the
        fire-master. Moreover, the work may be completed easily enough
        without danger in 16 weeks. The entire operation can be
        described briefly in the following verses, which were initially
        penned in Paracelsus’ own handwriting: </p>
      <p>There is a stone, and yet no stone <br>
        In which the entire Art stands alone. <br>
        It is found under the ground and mountain, <br>
        Wherein dwell giants and dwarfs. <br>
        I tell you this out of kindness, <br>
        Whoever has the same thing, the mist, <br>
        And the Red Lion shines clearly, <br>
        Drawing out Mercury, completely, pure and clean, <br>
        Likewise, in the same manner sulfur, and I tell you truly, <br>
        Which serves as the basis of the Art so completely. </p>
      <p>I must report still a further word to you, for above it is said
        that no other one should be taken than this one, which one
        wishes to attempt to transmute into gold. So know also that all
        metals arise from a common root source, as pointed out
        sufficiently, but still one metal or ore may be found purer in
        Nature than are the others, and on account of this, since one of
        the materials mentioned could not contain cinnabar. It might
        even be a copper itself, extracted from a pure ore which comes
        the closest to transmuting the gold, as earlier pointed out.
        That such ores were themselves alone mentioned, which were
        worked and then combined, must be added subsequently as a pure
        seed either to gold or silver, for by itself alone, however, can
        the mercury, as the philosophical soil, produce no seed nor
        sustain any growth. Then the philosophers say: "Our stone does
        not tincture anything and must then have been previously
        tinctured itself, only poorly completed, clear, snow-white, as
        in an ore tap, like a wax on a soil, which when well fertilized
        and pressed against, goes forward. Then, when you come to think
        that all metals come from a common root, you will soon be able
        to exhaust the subject of the origin of minerals". </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I shall not conceal from you the fact that the
        mercury cannot be extracted from one mineral ore as well as from
        another. It is very easy from the cinnabar. Moreover, if sulfur
        is burned, from the silver it can also be readily extracted, and
        also by gentle digestion using moderate heating and from other
        ores copper, antimony, iron with stronger heat, though still
        very impure, iron alone extracts lead, tin, gold bearing
        pyrites, gold-quartz, all these with stronger heat, and solely
        from mercury ores or minerals, but most slowly of all, then
        minerals containing the noble metals, sulfur, resembling a ruby,
        apparently bearing it itself. </p>
      <p>Now, will we, in the name of the Holy Trinity, with this
        passage, and sufficient philosophical advice, end this and write
        the actual laboratory report. </p>
      <p><b>Resume of the Theory and Practice of the Whole Tincturing
          Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take the raw material, which you readily recognize as entirely
        pure and, as such, has become most beautiful, since it is not
        contaminated by any other metallic, dark-making "ghosts". Then,
        when dark and not pure, so that as earlier pointed out, it might
        not be safe, so that such purifying must be carried out in order
        that the work will not be ruined. In case, however, a question
        arises, although no particular test gives positive results,
        which could be identified as such, still it is much safer to
        work in Corpore Lunae (the Body of the Moon), that is, in finely
        powdered silver, since after purification and fine powdering, it
        is distilled "by Saturn", so that no strange spirits will be in
        want of anything, and in its original manner, as mercury, which
        is in the first material reduced by mercury of the philosophers,
        which is purified through one of the mercuries, as pointed out
        earlier, and from a beautiful, clear, transparent ore, extracted
        and made pure, and also of a crystalline nature, which is a
        special secret of all secrets, with which one could work more
        safely and not be mistaken, the grasp of which they know very
        little, but Paracelsus had discovered such and he then wrote
        with clarity: "He knows the destruction of the metals as well as
        their reproduction". To bring this about, then, the older
        philosophers had many kinds of ways of grasping it. They also
        had many kinds of materials, one of which is even suitable in
        ordinary water and is the slowest of processes. Then there is
        the process of Basil Valentine in copper, of Bernard in gold
        ore, of Roger Bacon in antimony, and those of many other
        philosophers working with other minerals, although they all have
        an effect on one another for a purpose (although they all react
        differently), they are in exact agreement, since you know now
        how to treat it. I have discovered here a remarkable secret (in
        other manuscripts where the mercury extracted from the mineral
        shall give to it --- the extracted material --- its form and
        shape through its own characteristic properties, which I will
        never disclose. Moreover also, since I have your attention, I
        will say that the extraction from the mineral cinnabar reveals
        (and I have also delayed in telling you this) that the red
        material or carbuncle should be dashed to pieces and then finely
        pulverized, like its own Corpus Mercurii. Then when that does
        not occur, the mercury cannot afterwards dissolve its own corpus
        (substance) and this is likewise the greatest secret of anyone
        in the entire alchemical art and when that does not happen and
        the mercury is barely extracted by itself alone in a colorless
        form, it will nevertheless go into solution. For that reason I
        have disclosed to you such information in the strictest
        confidence, because the sorrow of Christ ordains it, for it is
        the greatest secret of the entire art of the alchemist, so one
        must have the acrid water which is able to dissolve metals,
        whose characteristics you now know intimately and are here
        distinguishable on the basis of the administration of fire and
        leaves its mark on all fleeces, with which indeed no mistake
        could possibly be made, the certain way to bring about
        transmutation. Nevertheless, both methods should be known, the
        old slow way and the new fast way, but the latter is the better
        way. </p>
      <p>For this reason, consideration should be given to material
        cinnabar which is absolutely pure. It should be pulverized as
        finely as possible, until it is as fine as meal, using a marble
        mortar and pestle. Take 12 parts of this same powder and mix it
        thoroughly with one part of slightly colored Mountain Luna,
        which is increased silver by nature, which is dissolved by the
        aquafortis, then precipitated, and then is completely sweetened
        by rain water, which scours the crude red material very well all
        though one another, so that one or the other might not be
        recognized very easily, and then they were placed together might
        not be recognized very easily, and then they were placed
        together in a vial and luted until completely stable with Luto
        Sapientiae and allowed to stand in a sand bath for one month, so
        that only the mouth of the flask extends above it. After 8 days
        over a gentle fire, so gentle that one can endure quite easily
        the putting of his hand in the sand without being burned and
        then for an additional 8 days and nights over a stronger fire,
        with the temperature rising only about one degree, and then
        finally during the last 8 days with the sand so hot that a drop
        of water evaporates immediately therefrom, while the product is
        making a hissing sound. It must not be allowed to become red
        hot, however, for when this first starts to happen, quickly take
        it out, and you will then find a white material at the top of
        the container, which in reality is the prime material, or the
        mercury, which is the living soul of the metal, through which
        hereafter all corpora of the metal can be reduced to the prime
        material or Humidum Radicale (i.e., radical containing
        moisture), which is the "living mercury" of the philosophers.
        This is the Secret Water, which has indeed given so countless
        many names, since all of the philosophers have written so much
        about it, yet it is still so obscure that one must admit that it
        does indeed, hold in very great secrecy that which God wills. </p>
      <p>Also to the Glory of God the Almighty, you have now the
        preparation of the clear, strong "vivifying water", which is
        indeed the "Acetum of the Philosophers", in which all metals are
        converted into their prime material, the Humidum Radical or the
        living mercury, the starting point for alchemical art and work,
        the masterly essence of living matter, I will now explain to you
        how you should purge the mercury, or separate the pure from the
        impure, so that no filthiness will be present that might bring
        shame to you, whereby our mercury, so sensitive and pure, might
        be added to its body of matter, and the bridegroom lie with his
        bride on their wedding night and make her pregnant, so that
        their family might increase and children be born without number,
        but, then, when this purification of the mercury does not take
        place, it might be impossible to finish this work. How this is
        accomplished, I will subsequently explain to you in complete
        honesty. </p>
      <p>When now you have also extracted the mercury and it occurs by
        sublimation as a beautiful white product, beautiful bright, and
        shining like a crystal, then take the same, completely purified,
        from the vat and be careful with it so that no impurities are
        added. Then take the mercury and pulverize it in a clean mortar
        and pestle made of marble, causing the mercury to move gently.
        Note well: Repeat the process in a hermetically sealed vial,
        then again set it in a sand bath and allow it to stand over an
        appropriate fire for 2 hours, where one could be able to allow
        to remain for the entire 2 hours, and therefore heat for an
        additional 2 hours in a more drastic environment, and still
        further for a third 2 hour interval at even higher temperatures
        over so strong a fire that the sand bath makes hissing sounds
        when water is sprayed over it. In this way, the mercury was
        prepared from the silver and its excess in the silver
        overlapping and remained as such, whereby it is appropriate to
        extract the soul from the body, for this mercury is the spirit
        which is so fiery and draws t itself the soul from the body. For
        it is indeed the spirit which is the vehicle of life. Now you
        must see how the elements were separated. First, the Spirit on
        the mercury of the philosophers was drawn out from the body in
        the first preparation of the silver, after which followed the
        soul, and lastly, remained the dead body, which became ashes.
        Also you will need to see how the Spirit was united with the
        Soul and you will certainly see a great wonder in the above
        separation. For rays will shoot now and then into the glass
        vessel, and the peaks of the rays are swept together like long
        spears, and above each of the spears, is a natural star, which
        the hands of man do not have the power to make, and this is the
        new creation of the new world, or, as the philosophers would
        say, is like the birth of a new world, with stars like the
        colors of the rainbow. This secret belongs more to God than to
        man, as Paracelsus said. Then we see the Purified Soul, which
        will also illuminate our own soul on the Say of Judgment, so
        that it will be purified from sin and be perfected, and then you
        will see a completely beautiful thing, the wonder of which may
        be like nothing ever before known. </p>
      <p>At this point we will write further and look about to see how
        the body will be dissolved and the Spirit of Life drawn to
        itself and received with joy. But, nevertheless, I will here and
        now explain how this mercury shall be enlarged and then will be
        able to permit many of them to the washing of the black earth,
        as follows: Note well, that here we think how this mercury was
        made, so that at this point only one example of leaven, as it is
        added to the flour, so will leaven be added to that which we use
        in our alchemical art. </p>
      <p><b>Increase in Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 12 parts of this purified mercury and 1 part of finely
        filed silver and from them make an amalgam, which will also be
        finely pulverized and put it into a vial and hermetically seal
        and then allow it to stand for a prolonged period of time in
        warm water until is noticed that the entire body is converted
        into mercury, which becomes corroded away, like aquafort does to
        the silver, and also as it does to all of the mercury, and in
        this way you can increase it forever and even ad infinitum. This
        is spoken of as the "whitening of the black earth". </p>
      <p><b>Solution, Putrefaction, and Mortification ~</b> </p>
      <p>In the Name of God, grasp and retain our digested preparation
        of mercury and take one part of it in a flask or vial and mix it
        well, then set the container in warm ashes for 6 weeks,
        whereupon you will observe precipitation taking place at such
        heat, until finally there is an ending of the intimate contact,
        and at the bottom of the flask a black substance will remain. It
        will not be black as coal, but will be dark as ashes. Then you
        will know that the first phase of the work, the solution and
        putrefaction, is complete and that the mortification, is
        complete and that the mortification of the body is actually
        taking place. </p>
      <p><b>How the Black Earth is Made White and the Dead Body is
          Raised Up From the Dead ~</b> </p>
      <p>Treat the black earth with a half part of mercury, prepared as
        above, then pulverize the two materials together in an
        appropriate glass vessel, making certain that the two materials
        are thoroughly mixed until they are subsequently in intimate
        contact, which process requires approximately 8 days. Thereupon,
        you should observe the Soil, whether it shall be transformed
        from the black color to the white or remain blended together.
        Then take it out and treat it with mercury or the silver water
        (nitric acid). Seal hermetically after pulverizing and mixing
        thoroughly and again allow it to stand for an additional 8 days.
        Then take it out for a third time and allow it to stand again
        with 100 grams of nitric acid with diligent stirring to achieve
        thorough mixing to allow it to dissolve by intimate contact for
        8 days and night, and then coagulate as before and treated with
        140 grams of "silver water" (nitric acid) well triturated
        together and mixed and then allowed to stand for 8 days and
        nights and then allowing to coagulate, At this time the other
        work is also complete. </p>
      <p><b>The Partitioning of the Stones as the Third Phase of the
          Work ~</b> </p>
      <p>According to the phase of the work you will be partitioning the
        gem stones and this involves the use of a white and red
        tinctures and shows you at that time the earth, which before was
        black, has now been whitened through the action of nitric acid,
        so that it is prepared to receive the entire ferment or Soul,
        which is white or red, and everything comes to pass according to
        the rule that what one sows, one also reaps, if one sows gold,
        then one reaps gold; if one sows silver, then one reaps silver,
        and so, when one sows gold or silver in the freshly plowed
        earth, then he will bring forth in a hundredfold yield. </p>
      <p><b>What the Ferment Should Be ~</b> </p>
      <p>The ferment or seed, which is allowed to lie in the soil should
        be a very beautiful, carefully prepared silver-lime for
        whitening, which should be porous and white, as I will speak
        more about later on, and for coloring red it should be a very
        beautiful, carefully prepared gold-lime and should also be
        added, together with the previously mentioned amount of
        material, checked subsequently, so that it consists of 21 drams
        of white earth, 14 drams of moon water, and 10 drams of lime or
        ferment. It is also to be understood that for 3 parts of white
        earth there needs to be 2 parts of nitric acid and one and
        one-half parts of Ferments. These three items shall be finely
        pulverized together with special diligence in a marble mortar
        and pestle, along with good mixing taking place at the same
        time. The process is carried out in a glass vessel, well-covered
        when the material is added hot. The material thereupon
        coagulates into a hard white material, which is removed and
        pulverized finely and then added to the third part of its water
        and subjected further to moderate heat, whereupon it begins to
        sweat until this liquor is evaporated and the product becomes a
        stone. This evaporation, and the diligent effort it requires,
        should cause no annoyance, since our stone is enlarged as a
        result and in this way becomes improved and perfected. Thus, the
        imbibition is allowed to take place many times, until the stone
        becomes complete and fixed and all defective material is
        tinctured in the Lunar Liquid, or gold, to the Glory of God. </p>
      <p><b>Careful Markings of Merit ~</b> </p>
      <p>One must examine and pay careful attention to whether it will
        melt on a hot copper-lead block without fumes, but where this is
        not the case, it must be treated more drastically to be
        dissolved on standing and therefore coagulated on a warm ash
        bath and dry on a stone, whereupon it is ready to be tinctured.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Stone to Use for This ~</b> </p>
      <p>When this work, as earlier pointed out, is finished, can take
        the first white stone and divide it into 3 parts, the first of
        which is kept for preparing future products, which shall
        originally be brought into contact with the Ferment and then
        well-dried on the fire. The drying process involved here can be
        carried out in two different ways, the first of which allows the
        material to stand for 8 days and nights and thereafter be
        further treated with activated mercury (first of all, however,
        purified with the silver cleaned mercury or silver water (nitric
        acid), 3 parts, triturated and imbibed, as earlier noted, where
        it was stated that the same would be needed to convert the black
        earth into white earth, and when imbibition has taken place,
        then sweating (syneresis) will occur, so let it, and take the
        liquid by itself that the entire process may be maintained and
        expanded, like an eternal work, in this way from an initial 3
        days and nights to 8 days and nights. On the other hand, when
        you have the white earth ferment, which is a sizeable
        undertaking in itself, you are able daily to accomplish this by
        using activated mercury, which is added to "silver water", 15
        parts, and then allowed to increase by itself on standing from
        day to day, the weight calculated to be also 15 parts. How many
        parts one takes therefrom depends on how much one wishes to
        risk. One might wish to risk the excess, which one knows to be
        the 15th part of his silver water, which he has added from day
        to day, first by adding a few drops and rubbing it in, then as
        the silver water becomes well mixed in, heat carefully at an
        absolute minimum heat. </p>
      <p>Another part of the whitened stone will be used in the
        fermentation process, involving silver-lime and its water
        (nitric acid), which activated the mercury and works
        continuously, so that it produces a perfect tincture, as is
        described abundantly, and satisfactorily, in a previous work. </p>
      <p>One may use the third part to prepare the red tincture, which
        then lies hidden secretly in the white tincture, which is
        recognized in the work. </p>
      <p><b>How the Red Tincture Should be Employed ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take one part of the white tincture, which had been heated
        earlier then completely pulverize it, and put it in an
        appropriate container and heat at a moderate rate (but greater
        than before in the case of the white tincture) and it will be
        sublimed within 14 days. The sign that you will especially take
        not in this part of the work is that the white earth is turned
        into red earth, which then increases, depositing itself on the
        glass walls of the container, so long as the fine is continued
        and the heat maintained, it all becomes red, like burnt saffron,
        and the earth is ready to receive the seeds of gold, with which
        it first shows an increase and then shows imbibition. Here, it
        happens, as the philosophers have pointed out, that the red man
        marries the white woman, so now the red earth, which previously
        was white, is taken and pulverized until completely fine, and
        then wetted by the Mercurium Solis (royal mercury, i.e.,
        activated mercury); which is prepared in many forms, like the
        mercury of the moon. The Mercurium Solis (literally, the Mercury
        of the Sun) is prepared, as follows: Take mercury which has been
        thoroughly purified as previously indicated, and 10 grams of
        very thin gold leaf, beaten in a gold-beater, and finely
        pulverized, and from this prepare an amalgam, as previously
        described in the case of Mercurium Lunae (Mercury of the Moon),
        and put it, after thoroughly mixing, in a vial, seal it, and
        allow it to stand in warm water, until you see that the gold
        from the mercury which has become corroded also increases the
        mercury from the Sun. After moistening this product with the
        Mercurium Solis, the moistened red earth is now made into a
        stone by rubbing the resultant material together intimately,
        then pouring it into a glass flask and allowing it to warm for 8
        days over a small flame, during which time it will undergo
        syneresis until it dries out and becomes hard. This entire
        operation is repeated a second, third and fourth time and each
        time the process is carried out just like the first, including
        the wetting down, the addition of the charge, and allowing to
        undergo syneresis for 8 days and night. After repeating the
        fourth time, then it will be time for the stone to give up its
        Soul and undergo fermentation, until a red product is obtained,
        which is then weighed until the earth amounts to 3 parts of the
        same, the gold water, or Mercurium Solis 2 parts, and the
        gold-lime 15 parts. The resulting product is then thoroughly
        pulverized and the well-pulverized material is treated as
        previously. The amount of heat is slowly increased and as a
        result of syneresis and breaks up into smaller particles, it
        reaches its final form, from which one part is taken as the
        increase and treated as before by Augmento Lunae. To redden it,
        Mercurium Solis (Mercury of the Sun) is used by itself alone, so
        it becomes excited by the gold, whereby the Trinity, body, mind,
        and soul, again come together and then appears to be composed,
        here in the red words, again indeed of black, white, and red
        colors, and even in the white works, from which you shall be
        able to observe the progress of the entire operation with the
        greatest of diligence, as has been described earlier in the
        work, from the preparation of the white tinctures up until the
        completion of the entire operation, and the liquid had been used
        up which had been fortified with gold water (i.e., choice Danzig
        brandy) in an equal amount by weight, as previously has been
        noted in the case of the white tincture or silver water (nitric
        acid), and as so often was done, again moistened and soaked
        until the final completion, as also was noted well, that you can
        maintain in the red work the fire at such a heat that thereby
        you will obtain the stone colored throughout in the deepest red
        color, like that of a garnet. Thus, by the Almighty and
        Compassionate God, everlasting Holy, Honored, and Praised. </p>
      <p><b>Exhortation to the Gracious Elector ~</b> </p>
      <p>God Almighty has made himself to be a judge between Your
        Gracious Elector and me, so I now report the truth, for your
        Gracious Elector will do me good or ill on the basis of my
        deeds. I declare this, with God’s help, that this is the only
        clear basis and knowledge of Holy Works of Art and Mysteries, of
        which I hold back nothing, the comprehension of which alone is
        impossible for me to describe, although Your Gracious Elector
        himself, nevertheless, has adequate knowledge. For when a thing
        is indeed represented so clearly, and when it is undertaken,
        however, it may (as so often happens) proceed under other
        circumstances. Therefore, since I have such a significant
        witness, neither I nor your Gracious Elector can be deceived. I
        must also take care where I should like to do it, even though
        such might be punished by God, that in revealing this divine
        secret of God regarding Your Gracious Elector of the salvation
        and the holiness that you can allow to come to this place, for
        the purpose that it will make good use of what is otherwise
        evil, and, for this, you must, therefore, give the strictest
        judgment of God’s reckoning and of whether Your Gracious Elector
        believes that it might be a lie or a fable, for so shall you
        know, notwithstanding, that I do not spend my hope of heaven so
        frivolously that I do not report the truth. This, then, like
        everything else described here, and touched by my hands and seen
        with my own eyes. To me also, in other respects impossible and
        inhuman, in this practice, reveals the influence of the color,
        the time, the day, and the hour, as well as also of the entire
        work, the material cinnabar, the solutions, the coagulations,
        the white and the red work so ordinary in its execution and in
        its reporting, nevertheless may be, in no small part,
        philosophy, as long as the world lasts, and so, Your Gracious
        Elector, in no philosophical book ever made can be found the
        time of your life, or can it even hope ever to be found in the
        future. Meanwhile, since I am baptized in Christ, as well as any
        other Christian, as the Great Lord and Almighty well knows, I am
        also mortal and all sins are brought into subjection, so that I
        do not know when God will call me Home, whereupon the elements
        will be able to be separated from one another, but I might not
        be involved myself or be able to do this, since I do not wish
        it. </p>
      <p>Now, if Your Grace, the Elector, please, so dear to you is your
        happiness and gratitude to God in Heaven to permit you to
        understand that you are worthy of this most important secret, I
        will reveal to you that which is the highest and the best. I
        will also not hide from you the slightest detail, but will
        reveal to you and explain to you the miracles and wondrous signs
        of our Mercury through the threefold paths which are to follow,
        so, accordingly, I myself appeal to Your Grace, the Elector, at
        all times, to demonstrate so much in 4 weeks that it can be seen
        that my suggestion is valid and not the result of a
        sophisticated grasp of the issues, for not, as it were, in
        nature and Art, however, can it be see what our Mercury could be
        after extraction, provided it is made as previously noted,
        namely, also, that it is white, clear as crystal, and easily
        accomplished. </p>
      <p><b>First Miracle of Our Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>If Your Grace, the Elector, please, when our mercury appears,
        as a clear, brilliant, and transparent crystal, then the same
        (not more than 10 grams) and 1 dram of gold wax, and 1 dram of
        benedict’s soap, placed together in a flask having no cover
        thereon, and a gently fire beneath, then the produce will begin
        to turn black and coagulate on the mercury and it has become a
        metal, since it clears away the smoke previously in the fire,
        although there is no metal that appears to be of the same type,
        in either form or behavior, still however, when it has become a
        metal through the coagulation process, then it appears as the
        most beautiful silver, although it is not at all clear at this
        point that the real cause is whether it will take up sulfur
        itself or not, namely, from the wax and the soap, which are both
        fatty and sulfurous, but this information is not exactly
        familiar and well known and contrary to its own nature, since it
        requires nothing other than its equivalent of sulfur to
        coagulate it with, and it has also coagulated this sulfur, as
        Your Grace will now see, for it is nevertheless a property of
        this sulfur, but is instead a beautiful wonder of Nature that
        transforms our own mercury, through a less understood principle
        of nature, in its form, its content, its properties, and its
        characteristics, into a metal. Be that as it may, it is not,
        however, like other metals, either in form or in content. From
        this, Your Grace, you can conclude how soon it should be
        performed, when something foreign comes into our material or
        something impure might result from our work. At this point, Your
        Grace, since it can be accomplished through the help of trusted
        friends, as previously reported, in seeking the pre-determined
        Hungarian material, which is entirely pure, although whether
        indeed to obtain the same, which would require considerable
        expenditure of time and money, and to introduce all of it into
        the work and thus advance the progress of the world, might be
        debatable, even though it would make the artisan less confused
        in the operation of the process. It could also be carried out
        quite well with material which can be found in Germany in some
        of the mountains around here, although this has not been found
        to be necessary for a long time, since indeed it frequently
        could be the cause of spoiling the work, on account of the many
        impurities and extensive types of minerals which they have
        there, which hundreds of specialists in the field do not
        recognize or know how to analyze. Consequently, then, many of
        these may constitute serious problems, on which God’s creations,
        Mother Nature, and the writings of the philosophers are looked
        as the cause of such inaccuracies, although the more reasonable
        men are able to handle such rough understandings. However, when
        one is not illuminated so broadly by God, and the work does not
        reward him according to his expectations, then he should,
        nevertheless, not disdain t desire the lofty endowments of God
        concerning his ignorance, for which reason, Your Grace, you must
        take this opportunity to be reminded constantly, to be sure, and
        permit yourself to bear in mind the great wonder which the
        Almighty God has stored up in these materials, although this is
        a situation, at least, you will not long have to endure. </p>
      <p><b>Second Miracle of Our Transmutation of Mercury (Copper into
          Silver) ~</b> </p>
      <p>On the other hand, and even still more and most wonderful of
        all, when I take 10 grams of this copper and add it to the
        molten metal, then the copper is colored with such a stable
        color, which is like that of the silver, so that also this white
        color of the copper may not be taken up by any route, since even
        the copper is driven off by the lead and it is then that the
        copper is driven away completely by the addition of excess lead
        (nevertheless 100 times as much lead must be used, and before it
        is gone, the calculated amount of copper is added) thereto and
        the wonder is observed and our mercury is stable and in the fine
        has its strong coloring and penetrating power, which can always
        be seen here and should be noted more fully where its
        characteristics are observed for a longer period of time and
        Nature’s laws are followed more carefully. </p>
      <p>And, Your Grace, when the metal mercury was treated likewise,
        like a large bean carried in the flow of molten metal and so was
        converted instantaneously into metal, which disappeared and
        could be seen no longer when it came out, without any smoke,
        just like fire consumes tinder or wax melts under a light and
        becomes soft as a result, so does ordinary mercury assuredly
        coagulate in the fire and smokes, although gold and silver are
        therein, which then is a wonder of wonders, when this is also
        combined with a foreign metal, which is unlike it and can be
        sufficiently recognized, since it is a wonderful display, which
        is not like anything else in Nature. </p>
      <p><b>Third Miracle of Our Transmutation of Mercury (Mercury into
          Silver) ~</b> </p>
      <p>In the third place, Your Grace, from our mercury metal, I must
        tell you further about the wonders that take place when you take
        the metal mercury and pulverize it finely by filing silver and
        putting all of the filings in a small flask and pouring over
        them carefully distilled spirits of wine, so that the filings
        are covered to a height of one finger. The liquid portion is
        then poured off and the process is then repeated several times,
        the more the better. The wine drawn off is finally heated,
        whereupon the mercury melts. On cooling, the residue of molten
        metal contains the mercury, which at this point is an especially
        beautiful white color, like silver, and this material is then
        pulverized, so you will be able to find out how much good silver
        has been obtained from the mercury, sothat it at once may be
        evident what was the result of our sophisticated study, not to
        mention also its proper carrying out, so that Nature can
        thereupon take its course of following up. </p>
      <p>And now, Your Grace, we entrust further developments to
        Almighty God. </p>
      <p><b>Other Universal Work and Short Summary of the Lapidis
          Benedicti ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take red-golden ore (which may be contaminated with small
        amounts of foreign material), which is beautifully transparent,
        much like rubies, which are found in the St Laurenz and St
        Vincenz Mountains of Hungary, which were referred to by
        Paracelsus in his Tinctura. Because of this, no other ore was
        even considered, since it behaves like gold (and contains only
        Lunae Spiritus) and is volatile, but actually this ore is as
        finely pulverized as dust on a marble block and not on metal,
        and remains pure and spotless. Weigh out 12 parts of this
        powder, mix well with one part of finely filed silver, and then
        add the silver-chalk from the Aqua Forte (nitric acid) until
        precipitation occurs and then wash the precipitate well with
        rain water. This does not permit analysis in this work, since it
        is only opinion, that is to say, arrived at only by thinking
        about it. After grinding well together, the product is carefully
        sealed in clear-glass round-bottom flask, and allowed to stand
        for 24 days in an ordinary circular bath or 42 days in a dug
        bath, so that in 14 days the Head of the Raven appears, and the
        same should be increased gradually, as follows: "Fecundum
        Gradus" (fruitful stage) of the universals described heretofore,
        even to the white mercury above, sublimed white and beautiful,
        seen as a crystal, this same mercury being then the mother of
        metals and the rich earth, wherein our seed must be sown. In his
        work, the seeds of gold remain at the bottom of the flask.
        Thereafter, the flask containing this material is invented so
        that the seeds of the gold or the sulfur fall to its own ground,
        in which it previously was growing. When the seeds are then
        swallowed up by the earth and the mercury itself is again
        growing up, the flask must again be inverted and continue to
        remain according to this arrangement until the earth surrounding
        the seed begins to change color and a beautiful green grass puts
        in its appearance and undergoes further change to all sorts of
        different colors, until finally the entire field takes on a
        golden color. At that point the work is complete. Then as often
        as the mercury continues to grow up because of the seed or the
        sulfur and suspends itself from above, just soften does it take
        on another form and color, which becomes very obvious. Then
        where the red color shows up ahead of time, the fire has had its
        greatest effect and must be recognized at all times from the
        color, for the fire must always be under control, and this no
        one can ever predict, since this puts him in the position of
        having to have his eye on everything. In such a work, all colors
        appear which can be found on earth, thereupon the flask
        frequently give the impression that it is covered over with a
        golden coating. However, the color disappears with time and the
        stable white color or Alba Regina (literally, White Queen) of
        which one part per countless thousand parts, remains (in all
        imperfect but nevertheless purged metals of highest purity), in
        which most of the purest and best metals are tinctured. The
        better it is, the more natural. Moreover, such occurs
        instantaneously. If one continues further, however, until the
        white form is converted into the red, and finally into the
        ruby-like type, the red carbuncle being converted into the
        highest type, countless thousands of parts of every imperfect
        metal are purged instantaneously into the highest and best gold,
        and this occurs in all samples. </p>
      <p><b>David Beuther’s Vitriol Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>When the beautiful Spiritum ex Vitriolo (vitriol spirit), next
        made in the flask in pure form from the gold or by heating 10
        pounds of vitriol and thereupon poured off from this spirit, so
        that it would be well to moisten it, seal it, and then allow it
        to digest 40 days and nights over a gentle fire and distill over
        a small flame, the resulting spirit is called the Mercury of the
        Philosophers and that obtained after sublimation and
        distillation from the ore is the Sulfur of the Philosophers. </p>
      <p>Take now the ore remaining as a residue in the flask, powder it
        finely, and treat it with the liquid drawn off, and then distill
        the product over a gentle flame for a period of 5 hours, until a
        white vapor is seen to arise and hang above the flask, then keep
        it well sealed. Repeat this process by decanting off the water
        extract and sublime the white material until no sublimate is any
        longer obtained from the Caput Mortuum. The sublimated of white
        sulfur is retained and the waste ore, or Caput Mortuum, is
        discarded. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, these white fumes of sulfur are sublimed one more
        time and the waste material remaining behind is again discarded.
        Take the sublimed sulfur, as is, from the water distilled off
        and the mercury, as is, and put them in a flask, seal it well,
        and heat over a gentle flame, whereupon you will see an increase
        in the white clouds, which will be allowed to stand until they
        have coagulated. At the bottom of the flask, everything remains
        dry. </p>
      <p>Now take just as much of he above-mentioned water as is equal
        to the weight of coagulated sulfur, mix thoroughly, lute well,
        and allow to dry as before. </p>
      <p>The third time, half as much of the water is added as is equal
        to the weight of the material present in the glass at this time
        and allow to evaporate until coagulation takes place and the
        product becomes dry. </p>
      <p>Fourthly, add half as much of the water as is equal to the
        weight of the material remaining in the flask and allow it to
        evaporate till dry. After such procedure, treatment of the
        material is considered to be completed. </p>
      <p>Taking the coagulated material, lute it in "philosophers’ egg"
        until solid and then digest it gently, until the most beautiful
        colors that you have ever seen appear one after another. Ask no
        questions about anything that follows, but allow the mixture to
        stand until it appears as a black mass, then do nothing further
        until the black mass becomes as white as pearls, then heat
        slightly more vigorously until it begins to turn red, then keep
        heating a little more until it becomes blood red, then turn up
        the heat as high as possible, until it can no longer be turned
        up. </p>
      <p>Take up the powder, as prepared, in wax and add it to 100 parts
        of molten gold, whereupon it will be pure tincture, of which 1
        part per 100 parts will purge copper in the flux to tincture
        clear gold. </p>
      <p><b>Ammoniacal Process Carried Out by Beuther and Colleagues at
          the Royal Laboratory ~</b> </p>
      <p>On November 1, Beuther and I each weighed out 2 pounds of
        antimony, 1 pound of iron-filings, and 1/2 pound of prepared
        chalk into separate crucibles and put them in a drying oven. The
        crucible was covered with flat charcoal and the oven contained
        well-covered charcoal and was allowed to stay at full heat. Thus
        the antimony was added to the iron, and the chalk to the several
        parts which were, however, impure. When all this was covered
        over, the antimony began to flow into the fat. Using an
        ash-colored flame (having a slightly greenish cast) below the
        crucible and arsenic in the fumes arising therefrom above the
        charcoal or the covered crucible, the fumes became completely
        white, and as soon as it was completely consumed, boiling and
        sputtering commenced, so that it was evident that the reaction
        was taking place. The crucible was then removed, since the
        material therein was nearly molten and had been converted into
        iron, which had been concentrated by stirring the contents of
        the crucible, which was then removed from the drying oven, and
        poured into the mold. When cooling was complete, the slag could
        easily be removed from the finished product, which was then
        weighed and found to come to 440 grams, much of the original
        material having been consumed by the fire. Since, however, I had
        carried out such work in the presence, and under the instruction
        of D. Beuther, although I have carried out one test by myself
        alone in his absence and have made another reduction as a model,
        and have obtained the same composition and weight, and have
        verified the same, and have allowed it to remain in the fire
        half an hour longer, before pouring it off, and have obtained
        440 grams of the product. Although we were able to proceed
        further with the reduced product, Beuther had allowed the same
        to stand overnight, only that he might be able to assure me how
        the sulfur must be prepared and used. </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Sulfur ~</b> </p>
      <p>From 2 pounds of saltpeter, in a new glass vessel, covered over
        with cold water, and set aside to heat, without however, being
        allowed to boil, was obtained a solution, on stirring;
        subsequently, 5 pounds of commercial powdered sulfur were poured
        into a glass vessel and the saltpeter solution was poured off
        and the sulfur stirred until it settled on the bottom and was
        then allowed to stand overnight. Such sulfur should thereafter
        be allowed to stand a good while in water and then allowed to
        dry. It can be obtained pure rather easily, and stored several
        years without spoilage and used. </p>
      <p><b>Beuther’s Further Communication on Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>When large amounts of arsenic are made from antimony, using 1
        pound of antimony, it is possible by this process to introduce
        only 2 times as much, using iron and chalk, so that adverse
        conditions will be held to a minimum and so that silver can be
        added immediately and no longer be taken away. Also, the silver
        will compact and be fixed immediately after the first addition
        of gold, as shown. </p>
      <p>Item: When the antimony in the fire will be too turbulent or
        too sparkling like a star or will appear to be too long in
        germinating, then pure pieces or dry iron filings must always be
        used. However, if too much iron is taken, the saltpeter and the
        prepared sulfur is added and in each case the firing or casting
        should surpass one mark by about half a drachma. Such a figure
        can often, through smelting and casting, amount to 100 to 200
        grams of gold to bring the required amount of reduction. When
        half as much antimony is obtained and nothing is lost in the
        firing process, then this work has proven satisfactory. And,
        although the antimony, when added to the product, reacts, it is,
        nevertheless, very unserviceable and must be further worked to
        be useful. </p>
      <p>In this chapter is now to be found the entire basis, and here
        we will proceed with the iron and equal treatment of the copper
        obtained from the iron, so that you will see what God has done
        for us by combining with the fixed silver, in these proportions:
        4 parts of copper from iron, 4 parts of pure gold, and also of
        fixed silver, and then driving off the resulting lead. </p>
      <p>On November 2, Beuther drew off the water, lying supernatant
        above the sulfur, and containing the saltpeter, which after
        standing a day and a night, the clean liquid was decanted off,
        and the moisture thereby skimmed off also came therefrom. The
        sulfur was put in a vessel and set over a low charcoal fire and
        then was allowed to coagulate very slowly, so that it no longer
        contained any moisture. Then, when it had been converted
        essentially into antimony, the danger might lie in the fact that
        it is a matter of concern. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The sulfur must be well stirred with a wooden spatula, so
        that it will not ignite nor catch fire. Moreover, it can combine
        with both substances when it is almost completely dry, such
        sulfur must be kept in an earthenware container, dried out
        completely over a fire. The sulfur can be stored after careful
        treatment and remain stable for an entire year and, when
        adequate care is taken, when sulfur is added to copper then one
        could not even suspect that the sulfur contained latent
        saltpeter. </p>
      <p>On the same day at about 9 o’clock in the morning Beuther had
        his plan, according to which 440 grams of the above material
        were weighed out, with a fourth as much, namely 110 grams, of
        precipitated chalk and the same weight of iron filings, and the
        crucible was put over a fire until nine-thirty. The antimony did
        not melt as soon as it has previously, but required longer time
        the more difficult it was to liquefy, for the reason that it had
        lost its sluggishness for the most past from the first contact
        and when added to silver, as is its custom, it took away from
        the first contact and when added to silver, as is its custom, it
        took nothing away nothing and even immediately with gold on the
        addition of Luna Fixa. In another heating the antimony was
        somewhat more flow resistant than was the case in the first
        heating, even though the chalk was useful in removing its
        impurities. But when it had been enough in the first heating,
        additional amounts of chalk could be added. As often as the
        antimony is smoke-dried, or heated again, the usual gray-green
        flame in the fire can always be seen and, since it is more
        volatile form of sulfur, it remains on the charcoal or the
        instruments and stays there, completely white, and not a little
        unlike saltpeter. It must be stirred 2 or 3 times until it flows
        very readily and just as Beuther had to smoke-treat his antimony
        for a third time, so he also found slag, which he reported
        yesterday for the first time, and then added it in order to be
        able to bring out a new pattern. Approximately 15 minutes past
        11, he allowed the entire model to cool, which weighed 500 grams
        after removal of the slag. At a quarter till 12, my model was
        completed and as the clock was striking 12, I added yesterday’s
        slag again and put it on the fire for a third time. Both the
        model material and the slag now had a lead color and show small
        points and, as Beuther had reported, when the antimony dissolved
        the fixed antimony took on a beautiful gold color. As the clock
        struck one, I took my model material from the fire and weighed
        it. The material without slag weighed two and a half weights.
        And, while a lot of slag had been thrown on top of the model
        material, the slag continued to be added by the fire, so that
        the correct weight of the model material could be determined.
        Since Beuther had by this time permitted his slag a good half
        hour in the fire, he had a handful or three of poor quality
        saltpeter, along with a precipitate of arsenic which had been
        deposited in the crucible, The slag was stirred and eventually
        removed. Freed from the slag, Beuther’s model sample weighed 2
        pounds minus 40 grams. However, I have the slag from my own
        specimen, without any additives, in the crucible set briefly on
        the fire just prior to two o’clock in the afternoon. At about 2
        o’clock I put 2 good handfuls of saltpeter in paper rolled up
        for that purpose and at a quarter past 3 o’clock the crucible
        was taken out and the sample material was separated from the
        slag and added to the previous sample material. The product
        weighed 10 grams less than 4 marks, but still 30 grams more than
        Beuther’s preparation. This may be due to the fact that
        Beuther’s preparation remained in the fire. From my sample
        material I have obtained bits of information which I can use for
        my model, since the sample material will be shaped according to
        the type of fire and so will its appearance. As the clock was
        striking 3 in the afternoon, Beuther had fired his sample
        material for the third time and immediately it melted and he
        found that he had 80 grams of prepared sulfur available. The
        antimony had been completely stirred into it. Thereby then, most
        conveniently, since water was flowing therefrom, he subsequently
        poured it into the mold. It was then a quarter past 4. The
        sample now weighed 40 grams less than 2 pounds. As soon as
        Beuther had removed his crucible from the fire, I added mine
        containing the sample and allowed it to remain at high heat for
        a quarter of an hour, whereupon 80 grams of prepared sulfur were
        added with vigorous stirring. The resulting product was then
        poured off and allowed to cool. After the fourth melting it
        weighed 3 marks. Therefrom I presented the Elector with 2 test
        sample portions in order to determine whether he accepted the
        silver which was offered him as well as he did show gratitude
        for the gold. Then on the 3rd of November, at a quarter till 10
        in the morning, I fired my sample for the fifth time and when it
        had melted I added 40 grams of sulfur to it and poured it from
        the crucible. The sample weighed 2 pounds and 40 grams at this
        point, and 5 grams were taken from it as a test sample and added
        to lead in an earthenware vessel and allowed to evaporate to
        nothingness on a sand bath. Whoever carries out this process in
        a similar manner can assure himself that something must remain.
        After 9 o’clock in the morning Beuther had fired his sample for
        the fifth time and in spite of the fact that it was more
        difficult than my process, nevertheless only 40 grams of sulfur
        had been added. At about 1 o’clock in the afternoon I weighed my
        sample to amount to 2 marks and 40 grams. After the sixth
        reaction and as it was ready to pour of, 80 grams of prepared
        sulfur were added with stirring and the resulting product was
        poured off. It weighed 2 marks. Subsequently, Beuther had
        likewise added his sample material and, after introducing the
        sulfur, he poured off the product at a quarter till 3 o’clock
        and it weighed 3 marks and 20 marks and indicated to me that I
        should not be unduly concerned by this discrepancy in weight,
        for his sample would be heavier than mine, since his sample
        still had as much iron in it, although my sample might be too
        selective and would hold more than his, as is also the case in
        the test samples, until he brought his sample more into
        conformity. At about half past 3, I had fired my sample for the
        seventh time and it weighed 2 marks and 20 grams, and after
        serving the slag therefrom, melting, and firing for the seventh
        time, it weighed 40 grams, while both of them together weighed 2
        marks and 60 grams. The sample at this point possessed quite
        coarse spikes, resembling crude stars. I thereupon had Beuther’s
        orders and so cut 60 grams of scrap steel from screws, which was
        added as a flux, 20 grams each time, quickly one after the
        other, and then also added 80 grams of the prepared sulfur, with
        vigorous stirring and shaking, and finally the liquid was poured
        off. The product weighed 2 marks and the entire operation
        consumed 44.5 hours. To this, Beuther also added his sample,
        over a period of 4.5 hours, but he added no sulfur or iron.
        After pouring off, the product now weighed 3 marks and 10 grams.
        Beuther reported this, using in this particular process 1 mark
        of iron and 120 grams of flux material, and could in 10 hours of
        work produce 100 quilders worth of product. At this point it
        must now be noted how the process is ended by a fixation.
        Friday, the 4th of November, at a quarter past 8 in the morning,
        I again added to my sample 2 marks and 40 grams of sulfur and 40
        grams of iron, added after the flux, and at about 8:30 the
        product was again poured off and weighed 2 marks and 40 grams,
        whereas Beuther had by this time melted his specimen for the
        ninth time and then added 40 grams of sulfur thereto, bringing
        the weight to 2 marks and 40 grams. My specimen had remained on
        the 10th fire for a quarter of an hour less than 11 hours and
        then 40 grams of steel filings and 20 grams of sulfur were added
        thereto. It was removed from the fire at about 12 o’clock and
        weighed 2 marks minus 20 grams. Beuther had also put his sample
        on the fire and it wound up also weighing 2 marks less 20 grams.
        My sample remained about 2 hours over an efficient flame and 40
        grams of sulfur were then introduced, bringing the total weight
        of the specimen on the fire for 2 and three-quarters hours and
        60 grams of iron were produced thereby, the total weighing 2
        marks and 20 grams. At two-thirty, I put my specimen on the fire
        and added 40 grams of sulfur to it. Its final weight was 1 mark
        and 100 grams, from which I took a small test sample. In the
        13th firing my specimen was found to become molten without the
        addition of any further material and it weighed 1 mark 1 mark
        and 10 grams and afterwards both samples were melted together at
        the request of the Elector. </p>
      <p>In David Beuther’s process the lead was allowed to come to a
        boil with the specimen copper and then poured into fused silver,
        and the volatile material driven off. </p>
      <p><b>The Preparation of the Chalk ~</b> </p>
      <p>Good chalk, which is not gritty, is broken into small pieces,
        the size of dice, is placed in cold water, and there it is
        allowed to soak for 1 hour, and allowed to stand in a new
        glass-stoppered flask and then set in a sealed air oven to burn
        until it glows and is burned out, at which time it was
        considered to have been properly fired and prepared as the
        previously mentioned model antimony sample y subsequently
        removing the coarse particles consisting of impurities. </p>
      <p><b>The Preparation of the Sulfur ~</b> </p>
      <p>From 2 pounds of saltpeter and 3 pounds of high-quality sulfur,
        or 3 pounds of saltpeter and 5 pounds of sulfur, prepared as
        recommended at the beginning of the process, the sulfur Mars
        being fixed and non-combustible, and furthermore gives the
        proper color and the amount of fixation leaves nothing to be
        desired, as silver and tin. The vapors of antimony are white and
        red, are among the best medicines, and transmute silver into
        gold, that is, through the red and fixed sulfur lying dormant
        within it. </p>
      <p>Some other workers may be able to purify the silver so highly
        that aquafort is no longer able to damage the material after the
        frictional wear of the lead, although only half as much product
        will be obtained. </p>
      <p>Proceeding with this fixed and compacted silver, as here
        reported, in addition to the high-grade gold, as far as is
        known, the silver should be free from any gold and refined prior
        to the test. </p>
      <p>The spirit of antimony does not, in itself, include the
        substance of iron, but its quintessential characteristics
        antimony has the perfection necessary for a flux, while the iron
        gives the fixed sulfur. After these two decompositions take
        place, a fixed substance results. And when the antimony melts
        for the 20th time, with some difficulty, then in each melting
        the iron is a cadaver and its essence and spirit are always
        given in the nature and the essence of the antimony, until it
        coagulates into the perfect metal as a result of complete solar
        and lunar fermentation. </p>
      <p>You must make use of a ferment, i.e., a substance which can
        remain stable, must be fixed, and cannot become volatile.
        Therefore, when you carry out your work on an earthenware plate
        or in a glass vial, or capsule, then combine it with lead but
        not gold, the more the better, to retain the volatile substance
        with the fixed substance, so that both will be fixed. </p>
      <p><b>Beuther’s Process from Copper Pyrites ~</b> </p>
      <p>Copper pyrites, preferably the richer ores, were pulverized as
        finely as possibly and heated, gently at first, subsequently
        more vigorously, but avoiding direct contact with the flame, as
        when sulfur was fixed, which must not be destroyed by burning.
        The burning must continue until the pyrites no longer give off
        fumes or a sulfuric odor. When hematite powder is noted, the
        process is complete and the product can be pulverized in the
        manner in which cinnabar is. The test samples, when applicable,
        behave in this way: A little of the pyrites, covered with
        precipitated aquafort a few fingers high, is placed on a warm
        sand bath. The aquafort does not turn a green color, but remains
        clear when decanted off. </p>
      <p>Enough yellow arsenic is now taken as fills an iron jar having
        3 feet and an iron lid which completely covers it. After heating
        over a gentle fire for 2 hours, the heat is gradually increased
        until the arsenic rises and begins to give off fumes, causing
        the cover to rise. When this happens, the air pockets are luted
        again and the fire slowly removed. When the material has cooled,
        tapping the jar and cover causes the arsenic to precipitate. The
        product is partially golden in color. After subliming in a
        retort with attached receiving vessel, the arsenic increasingly
        becomes snow-white, like flour, and is also quite stable and
        safe for use. </p>
      <p>Specially activated sal ammoniac in solution in clear fountain
        water was prepared, filtered, and coagulated. Subsequently, 1
        pound of antimony was carefully fused with 120 grams of iron.
        When a good flux was obtained, 80 grams of calcined chalk were
        added in coarse pieces, which permits extraction of the ores
        together and separation of the slag, and the breaking up of the
        product into pieces the size of hazel nuts, and then pouring
        into a well-prepared sample of aquafort in a flask. The
        resulting yellow solution, poured into a third portion, and then
        so much of the aquafort is poured off into good strong brandy
        that a precipitate forms, and that is how antimony is prepared.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, a crucible is ignited and 40 grams of saltpeter is
        placed therein. When the saltpeter begins to burn, then 1 pound
        of alum is added. The alum burns itself out, so that the
        moisture which it contained has now been driven off and this is
        what happens as it becomes pure and white and has been
        completely prepared. </p>
      <p>Take 1 pound of the above-mentioned copper pyrites, 2.5 ounces
        of the sal ammoniac, prepared as indicated, 1 ounce of arsenic
        preparation, 1 ounce of the dissolved antimony, plus alum, and
        the calcined copper pyrites, steeped with half that amount of
        well-distilled acetic acid and half that amount of good brandy,
        stir them well together, so that the mixture is rather damp,
        then add the weighed material to the pyrites, and then when it
        has been well-stirred, let it stand for 4 days and 4 nights, so
        that the pyrites are dried out, after which time 4 ounces of
        mercury are added thereto. The product is then allowed to stand
        for an additional 4 days and nights, whereupon the mercury is
        lost, so that 4 ounces of mercury needs to be added again and
        the product is again allowed to stand for an additional 4 days
        and nights. The last extract was then combined with the first
        and as much as possible mercury is then taken and allowed to
        evaporate from an earthenware dish, leaving behind a residue,
        shown to be sulfur. To this sulfur in a crucible add 30 grams of
        tartar and allow it to stand in a calcining fire. The tartar was
        the above-mentioned white material, which left behind a
        grey-black material which I have termed "black sulfur", 1 pound
        of iron can be converted into copper in the following manner: </p>
      <p>Bring to a boil 2 liters of water in a large copper pan and
        then add a handful of salt. When the salt is completely
        dissolved, a pound of iron filings is added and then 25 grams of
        "black sulfur", and in a half hour a pound&nbsp; (at most) of
        iron is added to the pure copper, 8 ounces of which were fused
        in a crucible and, when this mixture was completely fused, one
        ounce of the best Hungarian gold was added (as a seed),
        whereupon the mixture was poured into an ingot mold, made in the
        shape of a vial, and then covered three fingers high with the
        following water: </p>
      <p>To 8 ounces of aquafort, 2 ounces of the antimony prepared as
        above, 1 ounce of the prepared sal ammoniac, and approximately 1
        drachma of wine vinegar were added. When the antimony and the
        sal ammoniac had dissolved, then the aquafort was poured into a
        vial containing copper and allowed to dissolve for 3 days and
        nights. Then 30 grams of the black sulfur was poured into 120
        grams of wine vinegar and 40 grams of aquafort, which had not
        formed a precipitate but which contained 30 grams of the sulfur
        and had a blood-red color. After the above liquid had been
        allowed to stand for 3 days and nights to complete the solution
        process, approximately 10 grams of this red solution were added,
        whereupon all of the dissolved material precipitated took place,
        with a pronounced gradation as is customary until the mark of
        copper had completely dissolved, which often requires up to 10
        or 12 days without heating, since it dissolves so slowly that
        such gradation can easily be noted. After complete solution,
        finely-powdered brown lime was added, which had been washed with
        warm eater, dried thoroughly, and subsequently melted in a
        crucible, resulting in 1 mark of copper and up to 140 grams of
        good Hungarian gold, in all test samples of "Antimony of
        Saturn", as they might be designated. Everything which I have
        been able to make is, as always, to the Glory of God. </p>
      <p><b>Another Process from Copper Pyrites as Described in Old
          Notes Which Beuther has Fortunately Located ~</b> </p>
      <p>To finely pulverized, even though impure, copper pyrites,
        washed and edulcerated, and placed in a copper vessel, was salt
        water, slowly heated to boiling, with vigorous stirring. An
        eighth of a can of unprecipitated aquafort was then added, along
        with a small amount of salt, and the mixture was allowed to
        stand approximately 12 hours until a sulfuric odor was detected.
        It was then neutralized with soda, after which the solution was
        decanted from the pyrites. Half of the decanted solution, while
        still warm, was poured into the iron, transforming the iron into
        copper. Other samples of copper were obtained from the
        precipitate produced by aquafort, but were not such fine
        specimen as those from the unprecipitated material. Taking 1
        mark of the copper and fusing with 1 ounce of Hungarian gold,
        and then pouring the product into an ingot mold, and adding 6
        ounces of unprecipitated aquafort in a vial with 2 ounces of
        molten salt and allowing the product to cool by standing for 3
        hours, and subsequently heating for 2 hours, so that the
        aquafort bubbles up with the salt, and is now ready to use, and
        so is allowed to cool and stand until another day. The aquafort
        was then decanted slowly from the salt, into another beaker, and
        subsequently 6 ounces of aquafort and 30 grams of yellow arsenic
        and 20 grams of alum (both pulverized) were slowly added and
        afterwards heated vigorously until the material dissolved. The
        product was then slowly decanted into another glass container,
        to which was then added 4 ounces of aquafort and 2 ounces of
        golden sulfur, with bubbling. The product was then divided into
        3 parts, the first of which was poured over the copper, along
        with 1 mark of gold and allowed to dissolve 3 days and nights.
        It was then treated with 30 grams of 9 times distilled vinegar.
        One part of this vinegar solution containing the copper was
        allowed to stand for 3 days, whereupon a precipitate was noted.
        The other part containing the aquafort was subdivided into 3
        portions, poured onto the copper until it dissolved, and allowed
        to stand day and night, until the fourth day, it was again
        poured into an equal amount of vinegar, until a precipitate
        formed. On the fifth day, 1 portion from the water solution in
        the glass container was added, dissolving the material in 3
        hours, after which an equal amount of vinegar was added. On the
        sixth day, the third portion containing the aquafort, which was
        the only portion still remaining, was added and allowed to stand
        for 3 hours to dissolve it, after which the vinegar was added.
        On the seventh day, the third portion of the aquafort was added
        to an equal part of the material from the glass container and
        allowed to an equal part of the material from the glass
        container and allowed to become lukewarm before dissolving 20
        grams of salt which had previously been added, and then 2 parts
        (2 drachms) of vinegar were added. On the eighth day, one part
        of water was added to the third portion, allowed to stand for 3
        hours, and then poured into 2 volumes of vinegar. On the ninth
        day, the mixture was allowed to remain quiet until solution was
        completed; nothing was added thereto. On the tenth day, the last
        of the water was solution was added to the remainder of the
        third portion, up to 6 hours being required for complete
        solution, after which excess vinegar was added and then allowed
        to remain quiet day and night, making it the twelfth day. On the
        thirteenth, the water was gradually poured off, the precipitated
        portion being completely brown. The product was then edulcerated
        and dried, whereupon the material was converted into lead, or
        antimony. The transmuted copper was prepared in marked
        quantities from the copper pyrites, until 150grams of very fine
        and pure gold were prepared, without any gold having been added,
        for which blessing I give thanks to the Holy Trinity of God, the
        Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. As always, to God, be all Glory
        given. </p>
      <p><b>Beuther’s Jupiter Process ~</b> </p>
      <p>One pound of Jovis Puri (pure tin), cut in practicably small
        pieces, so that they could be introduced into a small flask, was
        added, along with approximately 1 pint of distilled vinegar, to
        the third portion of the aquafort, and a handful of salt, all of
        which were poured into the tin and allowed to stand for 5 hours,
        after which the clear liquid part was poured off, the tin
        remaining behind was thoroughly washed with water and again
        poured into a vial and covered with 3 fingers of aquafort. Then
        20 grams of sal ammoniac were added, at which point a strong
        reaction began to take place. The reaction proceeds best when it
        is kept in contact with fire. Then 1 pound of activated mercury
        was added, the more slowly the better, using an efficient wooden
        stirrer, which works better in material which is as viscous as a
        pulp. After aquafort is again added thereto, a vigorous reaction
        sets in with bubbling up and the product is stirred further and
        again becomes quite thick. Aquafort is again added very slowly,
        until the mercury along with the tin has become a single body,
        like white chalk (somewhat due to the fact that some of the
        mercury remains undissolved). It was then allowed to stand until
        everything was dissolved. When both of the substances added have
        been completely dissolved, 2 ounces of iron are taken and
        covered 3 fingers high with aquafort, then the material
        commences to effervesce and a reaction takes place, until the
        solution becomes entirely red or brown and begins to foam. The
        red-brown liquid was then poured into a glass dish and allowed
        to set until the volatile liquid escapes and the reaction
        subsides and is no longer active. After again being allowed to
        stand for a brief period of time, it again commences to
        effervesce and then quiets down to the formation of a yellow
        color and a supernatant liquid above the iron, which is also
        blood-red. The process is continued by the daily addition of 2
        pounds of prepared chalk and 40 grams of aquafort, and
        sufficient chalk daily to maintain a content of 10grams of
        silver. In my opinion, such additions must take place about
        every other day, although for a total of 14 or 15 times, so that
        from every pound of metal, as tin or mercury, 280 grams of very
        high quality, stable, finely pulverized silver results. As
        always, to God alone be the Glory. </p>
      <p>Moreover, at the very beginning 20 grams of the red material
        from iron and 20 grams of sal ammoniac can be added, which
        reacts at the same time with the tin and the mercury, however,
        no aquafort can be added until both substances are destroyed.
        When no mercury can be observed in the glass dish, then 20 grams
        of the red material from iron, 20grams of sal ammoniac, and 0
        grams of aquafort were added every day, up to 14 days. </p>

      <p><b>The Philosophers’ Stone ~</b> </p>
      <p>The author has carried out this work with his own hands and it
        is, according to him, so easy that whoever cannot duplicate this
        work cannot duplicate any other. Since it teaches what the
        mercury of the philosophers is and how it is obtained from the
        body and how the silver and gold are obtained from feces, by the
        use of fire, by fixing, and by amalgamating with mercury, and
        finally, in this way, arriving at the Philosophers’ Stone. </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Fixed Luna and Sol ~</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Chalk (lime) in a crucible, along with 3 parts of
        Calaminaris Stone, 2 parts of white arsenic (sublimed 2 o 3
        times) 1 pound prepared salt, and 20 grams of the same white
        arsenic mixed with 40 grams of tartar (calcined until clear,
        white, and translucent), all materials thoroughly mixed
        together, were treated with finely powdered silver until the
        product was thick as a ducat and a hands’ width, forming a layer
        upon the other material present, and initially one finger thick
        in the above-mentioned powder (after the addition of the
        silver). The powdered material was again added and the process
        was repeated, with adequate luting and cementing, using an
        appropriate flame. Nevertheless, the silver does not melt, even
        after 36 hours. After cooling, and subsequent neutralization of
        the product, the silver appeared to be black and as brittle as
        glass. The product was then thoroughly washed with water and
        allowed to dry. It was then placed in a small mortar and
        pulverized completely, carefully washed with ordinary water, and
        then allowed to settle, and the entire process was repeated
        until the supernatant water was completely clear. The water can
        be evaporated, so that none of the silver will be lost, even
        that which has been dissolved in the water. The resulting white
        powder, after treatment with borax (at which time it is in
        lamellar form) was cemented by heat and worked up as before, so
        that the silver is set free from the feces and the element is
        purified without decomposition, which can be tested by
        rectification of a half ounce of the powder in aqua vitae
        (distilled brandy) or by dissolving in distilled vinegar,
        coagulated, and again dissolved, until no more fecal material is
        found. This silver should also be cemented by heating, in order
        that the elements become fixed, and that the silver becomes
        fixed, as well, that they will not be dissolved by aquafort (or
        become grey-colored when held at high heat) or have lost their
        timbre, but are precipitated by antimony. </p>
      <p>After cementing, the gold also has a similar form, which alone
        is that taken (instead of arsenic) by sublimed red mercury,
        which cannot be struck or washed like the silver ca. It is not
        black at all, but by cementing the gold for so long a time,
        until no further loss in weight, then it is gold freed of all
        fecal matter and must be fixed by cementing 3 times more, so
        that all the elements are prepared. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of Philosophers’ Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>First, from the silver, dissolved in aquafort, prepared from
        vitriol (sulfuric acid) and saltpeter, precipitated by salt
        water, neutralized with lime, dried, and then poured in a glass
        container, set on a tripod or in a furnace to calcine it or
        reverberate it to give it considerable heat, as when lead is to
        be melted. After standing 6 weeks, the corpus was opened, so the
        mercury could be separated from the earth and the oil, even when
        it remains with the earth. </p>
      <p>The same can be done with the gold. The calx, by itself alone,
        must stand for 18 to 22 weeks in a reverberatory furnace. When
        the furnace is opened, there is so much gold that it amounts to
        2 or 3 fingers above the bottom of the crucible, much like a
        mushroom. The mercury can be sublimed almost immediately, even
        with a gentle flame. Generally speaking, sal ammoniac can also
        be sublimed and this is also the case in the extraction of the
        salt. </p>
      <p><b>Clarification of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Sublimed 2 or 3 times by vitriol or arsenic, the product
        appears as clear as crystal. When gold and silver have now been
        obtained, the product can be pulverized finely on porcelain
        plate with clear, transparent sal ammoniac, which is not damp,
        even when pulverized with 1 pound of prepared silver and 80
        grams of sal ammoniac on a porcelain plate. Add vinegar,
        distilled 5 or 6 times from its phlegm, to another vessel and
        distill it from a bath over a calx, properly luted, to give 1
        pound of calculated silver from 4 pounds of vinegar. After then
        allowing the product to cool before opening it, it was found
        that the vinegar, the sal ammoniac, and the silver were losing
        their odor, which was normally so strong as to be
        indistinguishable whether cold or hot. As soon as it was opened,
        the glass was removed and the contents were washed well and set
        aside for 6 weeks in a water bath, so hot that one could
        scarcely drink the water, because of the heat. After allowing
        the product to cool, the product was broken up into small pieces
        and distilled into a receiver by the use of vigorous heat, and
        subsequently set in ashes and heated gradually until the mercury
        sublimed with the sal ammoniac and was snow-white in color.
        After standing an additional 24 hours, prior to subliming, it
        was cooled, opened up, and the sublimed mercury was taken out
        and weighed so as to know how much sal ammoniac should be added
        thereto. The sublimed material was again placed in a glass
        vessel, sublimed still one more time, and then feces were added
        and the product was sublimed again until no feces remained
        behind. This is the body of material containing the oil or
        orpiment and was then taken out and weighed, so as to be able to
        better know how much mercury is present, how much calx that
        there had been, how much of the body of material and earth had
        been in the glass, and how much distilled vinegar remained to be
        dissolved in the clear water. After adding the feces, the clear
        supernatant liquid was poured off, coagulated, and dissolved
        again until feces no longer remained. At this point, it was
        coagulated again, and the salt of the earth was prepared and it
        was clear as a crystal. The sublimed mercury and the sal
        ammoniac were then finely pulverized with this salt in a mortar
        when dry and added to the glass vessel, and finally set upon a
        tripod or in a calcining oven for 6 weeks and heated, and then
        allowed to cool afterward in a cool place covered with a cloth.
        It dissolved to form a clear solution in 6 or 8 days. This is
        the Philosophers’ Vinegar, said to be our mercury, but also
        given many other names. </p>
      <p>By taking 3 parts of silver and 1 part of gold and cementing
        them in the fire, as stated at the beginning of the section on
        the Extraction of Mercury, followed by solution in aquafort, the
        calx residue edulcorated, and dried (to give sufficient material
        to treat with distilled Philosophers’ Vinegar) set in an ash
        bath over a small fire (as when gold or silver was to be
        dissolved) the product was then mixed with 3 parts of calcined
        silver and 1 part of calcined gold. After pulverizing the
        above-named materials together and subsequently treating with 1
        or 2 ounces of the aforementioned water and allowing to
        dissolve, 1 ounce of the blended calx was added and allowed to
        dissolve until no more could be dissolved, but remained
        undissolved as a residue. The water then contained its own
        nourishment and was the best solution that could be obtained,
        since it contained the dissolved mercury, along with all of the
        metals. This solution was then poured off into another glass
        container from the powder which still remained dissolved and was
        set in an ash bath and heated to the heat of the midday sun and
        even better (hotter), and covered with a double linen, whereupon
        it coagulated to give a grey powder. The latter was poured into
        a small glass vessel and covered. It was then luted thoroughly
        and allowed to stand until the grey color began to turn white.
        The heat was increased gradually to that of the sunshine of a
        June day and kept there until the material became as white as
        snow. On increasing the heat to that of the sun on an August
        day, spiegelgleisen-type crystals began to form, which appeared
        to be very much like glass. The heat was then held to such a
        point where such crystals no longer formed and the material was
        then said to be fixed. </p>
      <p>No harm is done when sometimes no spiegeleisen-type crystals
        can be seen, since the material had been fixed by the heat of
        the small fire. By starting with stronger heating, peaks of a
        hand’s breadth were noted, which was not good since it led to an
        increase in the amount of vapor in the glass and in the white
        fumes that escaped. Using a gentler fire, the material took on a
        yellow or red color and might indicate decomposition in the
        product, even though it is better to use a gentle fire than a
        much hotter one. </p>
      <p>After being fixed, the white material is divided into 2 parts,
        one to remain white in color, the other to become red. The part
        to be red was poured into a glass vessel, which was put in the
        oven, and allowed to stand until what is to follow has taken
        place. </p>
      <p>The material to remain white was also poured into a glass
        vessel, covered over with what will be later mentioned as
        "paradise water" (9 parts of water to one part of the material),
        properly mixed, and put in an oven until the stone (i.e.,
        gem-stone) is completely white, which takes place before
        additional heat brings it to the red stage. </p>
      <p>Paradise water is the active mercury extracted from the silver,
        which was prepared from the white material, a previously
        outlined, with the single change that pure tartar be used
        instead of sal ammoniac, which is translucent, but in weight it
        is comparable to sal ammoniac. The calcined silver accordingly
        poured into a glass or stone vessel and covered with distilled
        vinegar (distilled as previously explained). Then the mercury
        was added dropwise into an alembic. This affects the nature of
        the tartar. The mercury also reduces the amount of moisture
        present, as previously explained. From 9 parts of this water and
        1 part of the fixed stone for whitening, a change was made,
        transferred to a flask with a still head attached, distilled,
        and the products washed. The other glass vessel, containing the
        part to become red, was set in an ash bath and heated by a
        little hotter fire (about equal to that of the sun in the middle
        of summer), such as one might use in the preparation of rose
        water, and this treatment was continued until it is heated
        sufficiently in its own broth and all of the paradise water had
        completely evaporated, leaving behind a dark grey powder as a
        residue. The fire was then made a little hotter until the powder
        began to turn white. By gradually increasing the fire the powder
        became completely white and sparkling like snow, so that when
        you see it you will become very happy and thank God for His gift
        that he has given to Nature. </p>
      <p>Half of this white powder is put in a crucible and set over a
        fire, where it melts as easy as does wax. When completely
        melted, it is poured into a wooden container coated with goat’s
        tallow to make it smaller, harder, and as translucent as a
        crystal. One part of this material, added to 200 parts of tin,
        was converted into the very best silver that the human eye has
        ever seen, thanks to God and the prayers of the poor. </p>
      <p>Of the other half of the white powder, 1 part was taken and
        added to 100 parts of calcined silver, the whole washed and
        dried, and then pulverized, together with the well-dried powder.
        To 1 part of this powdered material and 9 parts of silver from
        the previously prepared paradise water in a hermetically sealed
        glass container, heat was applied as before. Since, at first,
        the paradise water was added only after the powder had absorbed
        all of the spirit it was continued as before until all of it was
        fixed and became white as snow, so that half as much again was
        taken for projects and the other part was subdivided and put
        into several glass vessels. </p>
      <p><b>Rubification ~</b> </p>
      <p>Using the other half of the first fixed powder taken to produce
        the red material, the time required until the white material was
        obtained by allowing it to stand on the ash bath until the
        material became yellow (saffron) was 8 to 10 days, with the heat
        increasing a small amount only. When the powder does not darken
        in color it means that the fire is not hot enough, so the fire
        was increased a bit more for 10 days longer and gradually the
        product (powder) began to turn red. At this point, the heat
        should be maintained a little hotter for 5 or 6 days until the
        product becomes ruby-red and shines like fish eyes. The heat can
        then be made a little lower as the above sign continues,
        indicating that the product has become fixed. There is no hurry
        in increasing the heat at the very start, however, since the red
        color never comes before the yellow or the white color, but
        always ahead of the black, even though the effort might be in
        vain and must be begun anew, for it is certainly better to begin
        with a low fire than with a large one, since the regulation of
        the heat is half of this work. </p>
      <p>When the material has become fixed and is now red as a ruby,
        then it is found to imbibe 9 parts of paradise water for each
        part of this material, just as occurs in every case with the
        white powder, although the paradise water from gold must be
        weighed out, just like its predecessor was from silver. With the
        paradise water, which must be luted well and then allowed to
        stand as before in an ash bath, and subjected to heat as when
        the lead was melted, without seeming (until all of the water had
        completely evaporated and a powder remained behind as a residue)
        to appear to be more black than grey, the heat was then kept the
        same until the product became perfectly white, and then the heat
        was increased only slightly until the color became a deep yellow
        and was continued at the same rate until no brighter yellow
        color could be produced, and then the heat was increased rather
        drastically until a red color appeared, until all of it became
        perfectly red, which was very fortunate, thanks be to God. </p>
      <p>The half of this melt in the crucible was poured into a glass
        vessel and sealed with sheep tallow. It became very hard like
        glass and ruby-red in color. It was as transparent as a crystal.
        One part of this material, treated with 2000 parts of lead and
        subsequently melted, proved to be the best gold, of excellent
        color and stable in all tests, as well it might be considered to
        be the world over. </p>
      <p><b>Multiplication ~</b> </p>
      <p>The other half of the powdered material also increased several
        times. Using the cemented gold, as noted above, it was dissolve,
        neutralized, and dried with lime (200 parts of lime to 1 part of
        stone), pulverized and then dried, then poured into a glass
        vessel and covered with 9 times as much as the pulverized
        material in the glass vessel. The material was then well luted
        and the heat regulated, as noted earlier, until the material we
        succeeded in multiplying the aforesaid amount of material and
        never ceased to be thankful for the prayers of the poor and to
        give thanks to God for His gift. </p>
      <p><b>Production of Ruby-Red Water ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Crocus Iron Antimony</i> --- Mineral: Red arsenic, amount
        used, 1 pound orpiment, 1 pound Roman vitriol, and 3 pounds o
        saltpeter, mixed well together and then treated with a half
        pound of sal ammoniac, and poured into an earthenware vessel,
        which can withstand a very hot fire, and also not become
        vitreous in the interior, was poured into a still, well washed,
        and distilled carefully, at first at low heat, then with
        gradually increased heat, until a white liquid distilled over.
        When such began, the color of the material in the still turned
        yellow or red. The receiver was then removed and replaced by a
        receiver with a better seal. The heat was increased until white
        spirits came over, which proved to be sal ammoniac, which was
        the first material to distill over. The heat was increased so
        long as the still head remained clear. When a red liquor started
        to distill across, but only in small amounts and then spirits
        and water distilled over and the distillation apparatus became
        white on the inside, as if full of snow. It was then carefully
        watched until the spirits and the water were drawn through the
        distillation apparatus with frothing, like as if a man was
        vigorously blowing his nose into the receptacle. When the
        spirits continued to distill and the distillation apparatus
        began to clear up, and the death’s head (colcothar, red ferric
        oxide) began to form as a fine powder. On standing 2 hours in
        absolutely clear water and afterwards being brought to a boil,
        the clear water was decanted from the residue, which was then
        discarded. When the water was evaporated, a yellow material
        remained behind. The yellow powder was weighed and the
        calculated amount of saltpeter was added and the thoroughly
        mixed materials were put into a glass flask, covered with
        distilled water, warmed gently in an oven, and a distilling
        apparatus with receiver was set up. The distillation was carried
        out using gentle heat at first, then subsequently more vigorous
        heat, until a white spirit distilled over. A red water then
        distilled across, which was bright both by day and at night and
        which dissolved the fixed silver, and gave the most beautiful
        tint to the gold, and even gave to all of the white metals the
        color of gold. Praise God! </p>
      <p><b>Other Work Done During a 12-Month Period on 100 Significant
          Tests, Whose Projection is Infinite ~</b> </p>
      <p>Four pounds of Roman Vitriol, which should be blue and clear,
        and saltpeter were mixed together and then dried. They were then
        evaporated together in an earthenware dish, using a wooden
        stirrer to start a reaction. Afterwards 1 pound of mercury,
        freed of excess moisture and using heated materials, were mixed
        well together and dried on a stone and warm strip of cloth,
        until no further moisture could be removed from the material,
        which was then poured into a flask to which a distilling
        apparatus was attached. After careful luting and allowing to dry
        further, a small fire was initially used and gradually increased
        over a 4 hour period. The water was distilled over in a period
        of 16 or 20 hours or more and afterwards the heat was adjusted
        and this resulted in a better process, although the same
        resulted in requiring 30 to 36 hours for the liquid to distill
        over, since by such a procedure the glass apparatus was much
        less likely to get broken. This is the common rule in
        distillations where aquafort is involved. </p>
      <p>When the water has all been distilled over, the mercury has
        been found to be sublimed in the upper hand of the still, as
        white as snow and somewhat hard, and retains the tincture of
        vitriol with it, when not further sublimed. After cooling, the
        aquafort is put in a safe place and the mercury is removed from
        the distillation apparatus. It is pulverized further with the
        other half of the material and then distilled and sublimed as
        before. Again 4 pounds each of saltpeter and vitriol, proceeding
        as before with the mercury which had been sublimed four times
        and so was a complete tincture. Now 80 grams of silver, finely
        cupellated, 40 grams of cemented gold, and 60 grams of sublimed
        mercury (taken in the proper proportions), covered with 160
        grams of silver, made by using aquafort as previously noted,
        were placed in a glass vessel, and 120 grams of the gold in
        another glass vessel, together with 10 grams of pulverized sal
        ammoniac, covered over with 60 grams of the mercury and the
        mixture of all three was set in a beaker on an ash bath to
        dissolve. Each flask has a cork stopper, so that air can reach
        it and, in addition all of them should be unstoppered every 2 or
        3 hours, for the same reason. </p>
      <p><b>Nutritional Material ~</b> </p>
      <p>Material in the subsequent form must be increased so that it is
        not destroyed by the aquafort. When 2 or 3 pieces of finely
        powdered, clean silver are put in a glass vessel and dissolved
        and the flask is stoppered and then sublimed mercury is
        dissolved cleanly with the gold, and more is gradually added
        until no more is dissolved after 10 to 12 days, then it is
        sufficiently nourished and has lost its corrosiveness. This is
        one of the great secrets of the art, since it must at all times
        be nurtured (sustained) on hot ashes. </p>
      <p>When it is also nourished by pouring on each of the small
        pieces in the glass flask, then from each must 1 part be fixed
        and separated from the feces and filth. </p>
      <p>Now, in the glass, along with the silver, there is a black
        powder due to the material remaining as residue and this is the
        gold, for in all dissolved silver is found powdered gold, since
        all silver contains gold, some more than others, to preserve
        such powder. </p>
      <p>When you now pour each of them into a flask and attach to it a
        distillation apparatus and receiver and slowly distill it from a
        sand bath until dry, then a good rectification results, giving 3
        or 4 fingers of aqua vitae (brandy) lying supernatant above the
        other material in the flask, then the method is the best that
        can be set up using on all occasions a distillation apparatus.
        However, distillation through a nozzle is carried out more
        slowly and fixes itself better, since on the surface, with a
        glass stopper or small glass cover, it is easier to cover, and
        this is necessary for solution, coagulation, and fixation to
        occur. Since each specimen is now in a covered flask and the
        alcohol is poured over it and it is placed in a bath, with the
        receiver at the end of the condenser, and it has been well luted
        and dissolved over a small fire, when solution is completed the
        feces remain behind and the supernatant liquid is decanted into
        3 other glass vessels of the same type, taking good care to pour
        another portion of alcohol 4 fingers high over the feces. Again,
        after allowing 3 or 4 days for solution to be complete, it will
        also dissolve, the clear liquid will then be decanted off, as
        above. Nevertheless, each flask is covered and each sample of
        feces is put in a particular glass vessel, and then put in a
        safe place until more feces are obtained. The solution
        containing the dissolved material is then poured into a flask,
        as before, and put over a bath, and the aqua vitae is evaporated
        therefrom until the flask is completely dry, whereupon fresh
        alcohol is poured over it and the product is dissolved as
        before, which requires 4 days. The dissolved liquid is decanted
        off, each into is own special glass vessel and other aqua vitae
        is poured over the feces and allowed to stand another 3 or 4
        days to dissolve them, and then the clear supernatant liquid
        from each is decanted as previously and the feces treated as
        before. This process is repeated until no more feces remain any
        longer in the solution, in the case of all three of the samples.
        The feces samples that were set aside must now be calcined, and
        from each of them the feces must be extracted, each from its own
        sample, and at this point they are all added together. </p>
      <p><b>Calcination of the Soil ~</b> </p>
      <p>In the 3 glass vessels containing the samples of feces, which
        should be completely dry, each is luted into a small glass
        container, which is covered, and then set each one into an ash
        bath subliming dish in a special oven. The gold must then be
        calcined a few times or more. Feces from silver require 30
        hours, while feces from mercury require 18 hours. The fire is
        regulated so that each of the samples of feces is kept at the
        same temperature, that is to say, that from gold requires 6
        days, that from silver 30 to 32 hours, that from mercury 18 to
        20hours, and thereafter cooled, so that they are sublimed,
        dusted off with a feather, and then each sample of feces is
        covered over with ordinary water, put on an ash bath, and then
        allowed to boil for 1 hour. After cooling, the aqueous product
        was filtered or, in the alternative, the clear liquid was
        decanted, fresh water was added again, and subsequently the
        product was boiled for one hour more, and then the supernatant
        liquid was again decanted or filtered through felt. In this way
        the soil was separated from the fecal material, which was now
        discarded. The water decanted off was evaporated and as a
        residue in each of the 3 glass containers was found a white or
        grey salt; the soil is again dissolved in freshly boiled
        distilled water, the solution was boiled, and decanted from the
        feces and evaporated. The resulting salt is still whiter, and
        dissolves readily as long as the salt has no fecal matter
        remaining behind it. This is the so-called Philosophers’ Soil. </p>
      <p>Taking now each sample soil, in order to obtain its rectified
        element, which has been rectified without its separation, as
        reported above, which is among those elements brought to the
        study of medicine, it is clear that, because of their subtility,
        their greatest external property is internal and their greatest
        internal property is external, and thus reversed, so that all
        their disorderliness has thus been exposed. </p>
      <p><b>Coagulation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Samples of soil are put each into their own glass vessel for
        each element, as instructed above. Consequently, 3 glass
        vessels, each well luted, are put into an oven, each equipped
        with distillation apparatus and receiver, to distill at low heat
        the aqua vitae therefrom, until the material begins to become
        thick, although not completely dry, so that it remains properly
        in solution, and thus can be seen from the material around
        there, which is somewhat drier and thicker than it was
        heretofore, and so is allowed to cool, although not completely,
        but yet while it is a little warm, it was poured into a glass
        dish, although even when it is a little warm it is thicker than
        honey and is thus not very nice. Each dish is supplied with a
        glass cover so that no foul air can enter. The dish was then set
        aside for 4 days in a cold place, until crystals appeared and on
        these crystals some aqua vitae still clings. The liquid was then
        poured off from the same into another dish of the same type,
        which could also be covered. The crystals were divided into 3
        equal portions, each in its own glass container, while the glass
        container having the decanted aqua vitae was set aside to
        evaporate until the product became so thick as that of the
        previous time, which required 1 or 2 days and was still not
        completely evaporated, although the alcoholic spirits had passed
        off even when it became as viscous as oil when allowed to cool
        further in a cold place for 4 days to allow crystals to form so
        that, when added to the above and evaporated further, until no
        aqua vitae remained on the crystals and the material was dry,
        crystallization was found to be complete. In this way the gold,
        silver, and mercury were prepared and purified. </p>
      <p><b>Conjunction of the Fixing Operations ~</b> </p>
      <p>Using a fixing-glass containing the powdered silver and putting
        it, hermetically sealed, into an oven in an ash bath and heating
        it until holding the fingers in the ash bath would result in a
        severe burn, as soon as the glass becomes hot, the powdered
        silver melted within an hour and the temperature rose, resulting
        in 1000 small veins. After the temperature had dropped again,
        the material became thicker from day to day as the material
        became fixed. At the end of the cooling process the veins had
        become so large that many could not be located in such large
        numbers, and hardly 15 or 16 small veins could be noted, while
        the heat was increasing to the point where a finger could
        scarcely remain in the ashes long enough to say a Hail Mary.
        When all the small veins had decreased in number, the heat was
        so strong that a finger could not even be held in the ashes.
        When the heat was held constant for 24 hours and there was, in
        this time interval, no longer any increase or decrease in
        temperature and the material was completely fixed (which should
        require less than 40 days). Moreover, the body is completely
        prepared and a medicine (in reality, perfected gold) can be
        prepared (the same gold) when a concerted attempt is made. In
        this way, an elixir can be made from imperfect metals. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the process for creating gold crystals should be
        investigated for it is a unique process and the oven is large
        enough that all 3 of the glass vessels and their contents can be
        investigated simultaneously and be given at the same time the
        same firing procedure. However, you should know that the mercury
        (as noted earlier) must be clean and free of all contaminating
        material before it is ready for examination and that it still
        contains the spirit, the vitriol, and the saltpeter, which it
        had taken up during the sublimation process, while the
        distillation soil and all of the others are not yet fixed and
        are things incorporated in it that are not simple but are
        compounded, on account of which the mercury must be heated until
        broken down into simple substances, and in the minerals 1 part
        should be fixed and 1 part not fixed. It should be understood
        that with respect to silver, when no more veins arise, it is
        enough and the silver is fixed (and the same for mercury), so
        that it is 1 part that is fixed and 1 part that is not fixed.
        The spirits of the vitriol and of the soil from the mercury
        contain a fixed part. Moreover, there is no way to increase the
        heat to the point where heat alone can produce the small stone,
        although from very intense heat 1 part may attain a sufficiently
        high temperature to be sublimed, still most parts remain as a
        residue and stay fixed. When the mercury in the glass vessel
        shows no change at such heat, as has already been noted in the
        case of silver, then that parties fixed and ready to be added to
        the body. </p>
      <p>In like manner is the case of the gold crystals to be treated
        so that they will all be fixed, as was said for the silver, and
        so it has been found to be a perfect medicine, even more perfect
        than the silver, for it has the power to transmute all imperfect
        metals into gold. </p>
      <p>When gold, silver and mercury are to be prepared, they must be
        taken together and a stone made therefrom. Pour the mercury over
        the silver in a glass vessel and, while the mixture is still
        warm, lute it well and set it again in the ash bath and
        therewith the spirit will be united with the body. Then allow it
        to cool, so that the body is ready to receive the soul or
        ferment. So, in the name of God, take this ferment or prepared
        gold and pour it while still warm, into the glass vessel,
        wherein are silver and mercury, and cover it well and allow it
        to stand for 7 days in the oven, using the same heat as before
        so that it will incorporate the 3 and then allow it to cool, but
        while it is still arm pour it into a glass ampoule and then seal
        it and set it in an athanor or tripod for 40 days. At the end of
        40 days, a transparent crystalline stone, dark red like a ruby,
        can be obtained from the oven, thanks to God and the prayers of
        the poor. This is of infinite projected vale, on account of its
        subtility (refinement). The highest projected value is likewise
        attached to silver and mercury, and to the gold, which is the
        most beautiful of all in color that any man has ever seen. </p>
      <p><b>Multiplication ~</b> </p>
      <p>To prepare the mercury, as previously explained, up to the
        crystalline stone stage, of which 100 parts were added to one
        part of this powdered stone, together in a fixing glass vessel,
        covered well, and set in an oven in ashes, heated so hot that a
        bare finger could not be held therein, and kept at that level of
        heat for 15 days, after which it was poured into a glass
        ampoule, hermetically sealed, and set for 40 days in a tripod
        oven. Heated to the point where the hand could be kept a while
        between the inner and outer oven, at the end of 40 days the
        ampoule was broken and the noble stone was taken out. And we
        thank God with all our hearts for His gift, this stone of great
        value, as projected from the first. </p>
      <p><b>I.N.J. Thesaurus of the World ~</b> </p>
      <p>(1) Common salt and Roman vitriol, 2 pounds each, were
        carefully pulverized and the powder dried in a dessicating
        vessel with stirring and use of a very gentle flame, until all
        moisture was driven off. Taking 1 pound of mercury in a beaker
        and adding the other material with thorough stirring using a
        wooden stirrer until all of the mercury was in solution, then
        pouring it into a sublimation apparatus set in a sand bath,
        using initially a low flame until all of the moisture is driven
        off and the material is completely dry. After heating over a
        higher flame for 12 hours, when all of the mercury was sublimed,
        the product was allowed to cool overnight. The sublimed material
        was as white as snow. The sublimate, however, should contain the
        spirit of the red vitriol, which is often referred to as
        "invisible sulfur". </p>
      <p>(2) One pound of vitriol and the same amount of saltpeter gave
        an aquafort which was added to the finely pulverized, well-luted
        material in an alembic and subjected to a gentle fire on a sand
        bath, and distilled. A viscid phlegm began to appear in the
        distillation apparatus, and the amount of heat was increased and
        then kept steady until the still head began to turn red. Water
        distilled over first and then the receiving flask became covered
        with a waxy material, which dissolved in warm water in a vial.
        After 2 hours, despite the fact that solution was not yet
        complete, a seventh part of sal ammoniac, or a little more, was
        added until solution was complete (although it is better is no
        sal ammoniac need be added at this point, however). The solution
        was put into a distilling flask and a distillation apparatus was
        attached thereto and the flask was set in an ash bath and
        aquafort began to distill over. After all the water had
        distilled across, the heat was increased and vapors of mercury
        began to form on the side of the condenser and eventually gave a
        powder as white as snow (and was referred to as Quinta
        Essentia). By increasing the heat still further, the material
        distilled over still further, and on cooling the Quinta Essentia
        was removed, leaving behind only the feces. The Quinta Essentia
        was again dissolved in aquafort and then sublimed, and the
        Quinta Essentia was now completely prepared and ready to serve
        as a medicine for the stones and is now indestructible, volatile
        and unfixed, as well as white as snow. </p>
      <p>(3) Taking the Quinta Essentia (Mercury) in a glass container,
        it was set in a Philosophers’ Oven in a dry room to be digested
        or calcined over a low coal fire for 8 days or more, whereupon
        the Spirit of Mercury was heated until solution became complete.
      </p>
      <p>(4) After calcinations of the spirit in a sealed container,
        placed in a water bath, an alembic was set up and distillation
        of the Mayenthan (also called Virgin Water, which is the
        finished product of the Stone from the last preparation and has
        a bitter taste and burns the eyes as does vinegar, and is
        volatile, unfixed, and incorporeal, and volatile and incorporeal
        on digestion. He who would separate the other three elements of
        mercury must again add feces and digest in a drying room and
        then distill the product over a strong fire, using a bath
        regulated t provide increasing heat. This resulted in a shining
        oil, which was set in an ash bath on a subliming fire of good
        heat, yielding a red oil and leaving behind a black residue of
        soil which was good for nothing. </p>
      <p>(5) This Virgin’s Milk was put in a glass vial and hermetically
        sealed and then placed on a movable shelf of iron in half of the
        oven, between the fire and the glass vessel containing the
        material, so that the Virgin’s Milk would not be disturbed by
        the heat, and the glass container was then set in the
        Philosophers’ Oven to digest. By common sense, the vessel had a
        similar fire on all sides, so that the Virgin’s Milk would show
        no flow. It is of great importance to have a moderate amount of
        heat, held constant at the same amount, so that the material
        would not turn black too soon, but if blackening does appear, be
        glad, since it is a sign of proper digestion commencing and
        should be maintained until all color disappears and the material
        begins to turn white. Increasing the heat further will have no
        effect, for soon all of the material will be completely white,
        the White Stone. </p>
      <p>(6) When the vessel is taken from the oven, which is called a
        Philosophers’ Egg, with the material which is now white, then 1
        part is removed therefrom and finely pulverized and better than
        usual is added. The other part is again sealed up in such a
        vessel and softened by a strong fire until the effect is very
        thorough. The product is then divided and heating gives a red
        tincture of latent sulfur-vitriol and makes it have a shiny
        surface. With nothing added and nothing left behind, this Stone
        becomes red through the power of fire. Note that in 2 different
        glass vessels the results can be different; in one giving a
        white product, in the other a red product, even though using a
        single fire in all of the previously described methods, except
        that in the one case to obtain a white product the glass vessel
        must be removed from the fire, while in the other case to obtain
        a red product the material is allowed to remain on the fire,
        albeit with appropriate adjustments of the fire within its time
        period, as previously stated. Note also that a few philosophers
        work with Virgin’s Milk and pay no attention to the other
        elements. Some of them also mix the element earth with the other
        elements. For example: 1 part of earth, 2 parts of fire, 4 parts
        of lead, and 8 parts of Virgin’s Milk and the resulting stone
        obtained is stronger than the red one and weaker than the white
        one. Both processes are carried out using the same type of
        containers, ovens, and fires. </p>
      <p>(7) Learn now the applications of this medicine. In the first
        place, the white tincture, which have the power to change
        mercury, lead, copper, tin, and iron into actual silver, while
        the red can give the metal the tinges of silver and gold.
        Moreover, it is also true that when metals melt and give off
        fumes, then white or red medicines will be produced therefrom,
        as many as are desired, and strengthening the fire increases the
        amount of melting and after an appropriate time, decreasing the
        fire leads to many tinctures which were produced and tinctured
        very deeply and to metals which were brittle, friable, and
        malleable. Even so, this is still medicine and many sorts of
        metals can be poured even though their color and malleability
        falls off. This work has also proved to be very fruitful in the
        case of many areas of medicine. Lead and tin have been shown to
        flow readily, although copper, iron, and silver must first be
        heated to incandescence and powders used in medicine must be
        capable of fine dispersion when applied. </p>
      <p>(8) These medicines may increasingly come into greater use
        because of their effectiveness, strength, and other good
        qualities and they are frequently dissolved in baths and again
        coagulated in dry heat, so that frequently they can be very
        useful as coloring agents. </p>
      <p><b>The Oven is also Prepared ~</b> </p>
      <p>A good type of adhesive material, horse manure, paper ashes,
        and hair clippings, treated with salt water and vinegar were
        made into a paste which can be fashioned into an oven, large or
        small, with a suitable door, the height of the opening of which
        was a span, or at least a nose, and there were 4 other
        apertures, one on each side, by which the smoke, fumes, and
        vapors can pass out, without collecting at the top of the oven.
        Thereafter, a thin metal plate made of iron was permitted to
        serve as a sliding door. Furthermore, there are 4 indentations
        for arms and pulleys to form a cross, set at the top of the
        oven, so that all of the heat will best be utilized. On the
        metal plate there is a glass vessel for preparing the adhesive
        material and a Philosophers’ Egg to aid in the digestion process
        and in the heating of the Stone. The 4 sides of the plate were
        also carefully fitted into the oven, so that the rings can be
        about 5, 4, or 3 fingers in width, depending upon the width of
        the iron, but there will be at least one width between the side
        of the plate and the oven. A small removable cover can also be
        made of porcelain, copper, or iron. One can also use a small
        box, whose cover is removable, and mark the place where the
        material in the oven will be inspected. The cover will be well
        constructed, both inside and outside, to hold the heat and make
        it a suitable apparatus having a door. In this way a hand can be
        used to turn up or down the heat and so control it and the
        extent of the fire. At the beginning of the digestion period or
        of the heating of the Stone, such heat is sufficient if you may
        hold a hand between the containing vessel and the side of the
        oven for a good while. Take care that you do not get the vessels
        mixed up and so have to discard the flask in your analysis. You
        must cover it well at all the openings so that too much heat
        does not escape. </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Salt of the Earth or Saltpeter of the
          Philosophers from Virgin Soil ~</b> </p>
      <p>In the month of May, when the sky is clear and bright and the
        air is pure and the weather is still fine, without wind and
        rain, and lovely odors are everywhere, that is, as it were,
        lovely odors are rising all around, one should enjoy the early
        morning and the sunrise, along a beautiful path where the good
        black earth is so rich, and even more beautiful is the red, the
        gold, and the red-gold of Nature’s beautiful plants and flowers,
        which take care to bear in the clover family. The red and gold
        earth in the mountains of the wine country is also very
        magnificent. Also even the lime-pit, when you can regard it as
        more than just sandy. Dig down a few hundredweights, shut
        yourself apart from one another, so that the stars might well
        operate therein: This, one should also let lie fallow for 14
        days and nights; however, should rain set in, one must cover it
        well with straw until the weather becomes clear. After waiting
        14 days, put the earth in tubs and cover it well. Afterwards, a
        few tubs should be made, like the silk refiners have, for
        subjecting the soil to washings with lye (warm water is best)
        and allow it to stand for 24 hours and then afterwards draw it
        off, boil it down tone-fourth its original volume, let it stand
        for a few days, and then open it. It is like saltpeter; it
        burns, but not much. It is then dissolved, filtered, and
        coagulated with rain water until complete. Hereafter, it is
        called Sal Terra (Salt of the Earth) and also Saltpeter
        Philosophorum (Philosophers’ Saltpeter) or even Sal Natureae
        Virgineum (Pure Natural Salt) which is dissolved in the seas of
        the world. The hand is not easily washed. </p>
      <p>This is now the high Secretum Philosophorum (Philosophers’
        Secret) in which the Universal Spirit of the World is often
        hidden. It is often called Woman’s Work, since it is associated
        with soapmaking and cooking. </p>
      <p>Sal hoc naturae (Salt of this nature) is thus a unique thing to
        be considered, since it is actually made up of three different
        kinds of salt. First, there is a universal salt of the nature of
        saltpeter and soil, in which the spirit of the world frequently
        resides. It is not volatile and not completely fixed, but has a
        middle nature. More than any other, it contains a sal ammoniac,
        which is actually volatile. And, in the third place, it contains
        hidden in it an alkali, and a fixed salt. It is also triune, and
        manifests itself in its subsequent reactions. </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of the Universal Spirit and Volatile Salt; Sal
          Ammoniac and Salt of the Earth ~</b> </p>
      <p>Sal Superius (Superior Salt), 1 pound, is added to 3 pounds of
        special earth, from which the salt was made, although such earth
        must first be further calcined in a potter’s kiln, then made
        into droplets with rain water (much like child’s play). The
        droplets were allowed to dry and then distilled in a
        well-mounted retort above a controlled, but open, flame, by way
        of a condenser into a large receiver, wherein some pure water
        had been poured. The distillation was carried out using a hot
        fire. After the volatile salts had sublimed in the receiver, the
        part of the product remaining in the neck of the retort was
        gradually allowed to cool, the spirits and volatile salts
        present in the receiver were then washed together and combined
        and the combined washings were carefully neutralized. Again
        taking 1 pound of salt, proceed as before and repeat this
        procedure 4, 5 or 6 times, neutralizing the spirits and volatile
        salts carefully so as to incur no appreciable loss. The spirits
        and volatile salts were neutralized together in a large glass
        flask and separated from the phlegm on a steam bath and
        distilled over from a sand bath six successive times to give the
        spirits, which were always carefully preserved. </p>
      <p>However, the salts remaining behind at the bottom of the flask
        after distillation over a hot fire was neutralized along with
        such as were sublimed. The process was repeated 5 or 6 times,
        and the product was white as snow, with no feces remaining
        behind, and was stored safely. </p>
      <p>Now all Capita Mortua (dead heads) were taken and calcined one
        more time in a potter’s kiln and the resulting fixed salts were
        extracted with distilled rain water therefrom and the best of
        such was purified until it was perfectly white, sparkling, and
        clear as a crystal, with no fecal matter left in the residue. </p>
      <p><b>Composition of the Triune Principle ~</b> </p>
      <p>To have body, soul, and spirit separated from one another was
        brought about through the preliminary work involving fire, and
        also from heterogeneous, liberates mankind from the curse of the
        earth. Now we will examine such things together. </p>
      <p>Volatile and fixed salts have so much in common. They can be
        pulverized in a glass mortar to a very fine powder. Put in a
        glass flask, with spirits of our salts added separately and then
        combined all together and well mixed, were subjected to
        digestion by the gentle heat of an ash bath for 8 days and
        nights and the three such principles were united rather than
        pleasantly again with one another in a single solution. Some
        feces were added, and then subsequently separated out, giving
        the proper master key of the philosophers in hand, with which
        all hidden metals, minerals, and precious stones are unlocked
        and brought to their quintessence. This then is the true
        universal measure, the proper water of life, with which all
        metals can become readily combined, especially the gold, which
        can be made alive, and the fountain, in which all metals are
        easily bathed and again become alive. It is the bath of their
        regeneration, their proper original material, and the most
        harmonious, most beloved mother, from which they all originated
        in the first place, and they again enter into life with great
        joy and pleasure, entering into the new and better life into
        which they have been reborn. It is the great salty sea of the
        world, the water bridge which, from the earth, serves as a
        general bridge over which everyman must cross, whoever was
        created. And thus, it is with the spoken word. It is St Basil’s
        All in All, for in it everything extends and everything arises
        from it. It is the true being of all things. It is our
        Philosophers’ Virgin Milk. </p>
      <p><b>Subsequent Work and Composition ~</b> </p>
      <p>When gold is desired, then it is filed 7 or 8 times from fused
        antimony, the finer, the better (1 part) and 10 parts of Aqua
        Mercurii (mercurial water), mixed together together in a
        separating flask, the flask is then sealed, and set for a day,
        and a night on an ash bath, whereupon the gold is completely and
        readily dissolved. The earth, situated at the bottom, is
        separated therefrom. The clear supernatant liquid is poured into
        a vial, sealed hermetically, and set in the athanor oven. At
        first, Ignis Vaporis (Fire Vapor) was noted, until is became
        black, which happened in the space of 40 days, and then in the
        ashes a somewhat stronger fire was noted, so that the glass
        became so warm, like the sun at midday in summer shines on the
        surface of the cover, so that in the following 50 days all kinds
        of beautiful colors can be seen. Afterwards, set in a sand bath,
        as deep as a dollar’s thickness, it remained only broad enough
        to show subsequently after 50 days the bright light of the
        diadem (the moon). Therefore, do not cease, but be sure to
        continue your Gradum Ignis (degree of fire), for in this way all
        of the material will be yellow in 30 days. At the end of that
        time the glass vessel should be entirely buried in the sand and
        when heated strongly, the product will become blood-red in 40
        days and in the middle it will appear as a luminous ruby, so
        Nature has distinguished them apart. It is seen here that it
        will not become a well-known tincture, but it distinguishes
        Nature from the heterogeneous. This is the same that one sets
        aside when it is of no use (although it can be made use of in
        some chemical analysis and separations. </p>
      <p><b>The Composition of Precious Stones with Their Own Liquids ~</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Detection of Mercury</i> --- The salt of the earth is rather
        magnetic, that is, it shows the spirit of the air. According to
        the preparation of our water or Water of Neptune, in which the
        gold melts like ice in warm water, then it is the proper key,
        which gold opens to take its soul away, as a well-known Sal
        Ignis (Salt of Fire) of Nature, an imaginary spirit, the dragon,
        greedily devouring its own tail, the non-combustible sulfur.
        Note that when one makes mercury in the spirit of the world,
        then he is toying with time in so doing, and has hereafter an
        entry in gold, then the gold itself is also the Spirit of World
        red mercury coagulates. </p>
      <p>A bath was prepared using our Sal Aquae or Spiritus Mundi
        increased to 9 degrees in mercury, such as that which was
        indicated by Philalethes by 9 eagles, representing that all
        metals were purified to the highest degree and are, apparently
        like pearls. Fortunate indeed is he who is able to conclude a
        bargain. </p>
      <p>Our material in the atmosphere around is the mercury of the
        philosophers and the true mineral and vitriol and we have
        deducted a few hours to active metals, helping them to combine
        them in a flask and to putrefy them by the use of gentle heat,
        to which purpose a white clay is added at the end, which
        improves the quality of the precious stone. By redistilling on a
        steam bath, the material can also be converted in a few days
        into an active metal, using the above and carrying it out in a
        flask. Our material includes everything, earth, air, and water,
        all combined in one. </p>

        Abstract of Profit Ledger. Practical Approach to the Problem of
        Processing Food. Which of the More than One Thousand Processes
        so German and so Clever Have Not Been Described. </p>
      <p>An excellent and very useful and true examination of the art,
        using a few grams of fine gold and other less important
        conditions and the lighter work load involved as a result of the
        properly conducted distillation techniques in a very short time.
        Approximately 6 or 7 weeks are required to make a few grams of
        the tincture and to prepare it for use, as actually are clear in
        what is to follow. </p>
      <p>Using 10 grams of this tincture to compare 1 mark of fine
        silver to truly natural good gold, as God has created the Earth
        and can add color to the same, and this in all tests remains
        proper and authentic, since aquafort can not attack it or cause
        damage to it or to the antimony glass or is itself damaged in
        any test. The same can also be carried out better with such a
        tincture, so that when 100 grams of mercury, purified as before,
        were added to 10 grams of the same well-purified gold in the
        same form as previously noted, all of the test samples easily
        passed all of the tests that were made. </p>
      <p>The same work has been carried out at least 7times in a single
        year and each time 110 grams of the reported tincture were made,
        so that in a single year the total was 770 grams, of which 10
        grams were used to make 1 mark of silver into gold, so that in a
        year 77 marks of gold at 160 per mark. At 10 grams for 8 gulden
        and each mark estimated at 128 guilders, totaled 77 marks of
        pure silver, the process can earn 9856 guilders. </p>
      <p>From this sum of money, at a cost of 56 guilders for 70 grams
        of pure gold (at 8 guilders per 10 grams), more than 739
        guilders and at 3 batzen was the estimate, and 8more guilders
        for the glass apparatus, fuel costs, and other expenses, so one
        must make in a year by this process, and subtracting 2 guilders
        per week for the wages of the laboratory workers and 1 guilder
        for the cost of the laboratory bench makes 130 guilders, making
        the entire cost of the year 933 guilders and 3 batzen.
        Subtracting that amount, there is still a profit of 892 guilders
        and 12 batzen left, after deducting all expenses, so that one
        man will have that amount per year, by what this endeavor lays
        out and can accomplish. </p>
      <p>And when one man, using the tincture, might by the following
        process, being allowed to work with the mercury, it would cost
        him no ore than 6 batzen, in addition to the 77 marks, 30
        guilders, and 12 batzen. So this man has a projected overall
        income for the year of approximately 9631 guilders and 3 batzen.
      </p>
      <p>This magnificent, grand, useful, and exalted artistic endeavor
        had a man from Venice, who also related to me that in this
        process and the work in carrying it out as follows hereafter, to
        work in his laboratory, and be allowed to carry out the tests
        which were deemed appropriate. And such artistic endeavor was
        also taken to England, where the King of England himself also
        tested it and found it to be just exactly as claimed, thereupon
        approximately 20,000 guilders in gold was set as the sale price,
        and subsequently testing of this artistic production was carried
        out in the laboratories of Venice and England, by Polish and
        Bohemian workers, and by the same workers in the laboratories of
        Danzig, Prussia, each separate one costing about 2,000 ducats,
        without all of the tests being done, since there was already
        good information about these tests. </p>
      <p>Now follows the information about the process, heretofore
        passed over, referred to as the Art of Preparing Tinctures. In
        the Name of Almighty God: </p>
      <p>To start with, using 3 pounds of white Salt from Halle in a
        Waldenburger flask and pouring over it 1 measure of distilled
        vinegar then sealing the cover of the flask with prudent luting
        prepared from very adhesive glue, and then allowing the flask
        containing the salt to sit on a warm sand bath or coal stove
        until the salt becomes completely dry, when it is then ready.
        Note that this is the salt and vinegar, as hereafter follows,
        that now brings about the mixing of the mercury with the salt,
        as will hereafter be reported. </p>
      <p>Now followed the method whereby the vinegar should be
        distilled: Taking 2 measures of good vinegar, to which are added
        2 handfuls of ordinary salt, and putting into a distilling flask
        such as aquafort is distilled in, and continuing diligently, so
        that no black material distills over (and if such should take
        place, remove the receiver immediately), for the material
        remaining inside the distillation flask should still distill
        over as a clear distillate. Now ass another handful of salt to
        the clear liquid and continue the distillation as formerly.
        After 3 such distillations, the vinegar is properly prepared,
        the salt is collected, as noted above, and you will now see the
        Quintessence of all metals and the mercury of the philosophers,
        which is found in all places and is by no means by the mercury
        which is here referred to as living, which is toxic, but which
        is found as a salt to be something that no man can do without. </p>
      <p>In the Name of God: Now take again 3 pounds of good dry white
        salt of Halle and add thereto 60 grams of the above steeped salt
        from the flask, mix the ingredients well, then put them into a
        sturdy glass retort or flask, glazed on the inside, and put the
        flask into the oven on the well-preserved side. Then attach a
        glass receiver, after putting in the receiver half a can of
        distilled water, well-covered, so that the glass receiver will
        be attached to the retort or the distilling apparatus. </p>
      <p>After heating over a gentle fire so that the flask will not
        break or even begin to be damaged, since such a gentle fire
        needs an entire day, so for the next few days, the fire should
        be somewhat hotter and the flask will glow with a dull brown
        color rather than with a bright color, and the salt doesn’t
        melt, but only appears as white fumes. This is the so-called
        Quintessence of all metals, whose ores are put into water and
        allowed to remain at glowing heat for 8 days, until a white
        material begins to sublime at the top of the receiver. This is
        the Mercury of the Philosophers. After distilling 8 days, the
        fire was removed and the white material was rinsed from the neck
        of the flask into the water and the rinse water was poured into
        a glass flask. A still head was attached to the flask and the
        material was distilled over an ash bath and in 12 hours the
        water had distilled over and tastes sweet, although it soon
        becomes sour like vinegar, becomes then stronger with time
        gradually, and finally sets the teeth on edge. When the
        distillation is finished, the residue is removed from the fire
        and allowed to cool. This is then the Oleum Salis (salty oil). </p>
      <p>Note, too, that the sweet water distilled over in half a day
        and on cooling crystals formed rapidly in the water. The
        crystals were long and pointed and much like asbestos, but fine
        and sweet. This is the Mercury of the Philosophers. </p>
      <p>The water from which the crystals were taken was distilled
        again for half a day, as before, and then allowed to cool. </p>
      <p>Again crystals formed, as noted above. When no more crystals
        were formed, the water was again distilled off and the salty oil
        was obtained, as before. You should be aware that this Oleum
        Salis is the gold and when finely dispersed and dissolved that
        it is the water contained in all metals. It is also able to
        extract the sulfur from all metals and to serve as a medicine
        for men and metals. </p>
      <p>The tincture is made as follows: 70 grams of the above Oleum
        Salis and 10 grams of finely pulverized gold give a yellow
        solution in water and yield 30 grams of the sweet crystals. The
        glass container is carefully sealed and set in a warm place
        until coagulation takes place and a hand material is formed.
        This hard material is then finely pulverized and put in a glass
        container which is then set in a steam bath, until the soft oil
        which is formed soon hardens. Distillation of this product from
        a steam bath until no more fumes come off and the material flows
        like wax, indicates that the product is finished. This amounts
        to 10grams, which make up to 1 mark of fine silver. While still
        hot, and allowing to flow together for a good half hour and then
        pouring into a tin container, the result is genuine natural
        gold, which God created and put in the earth, tested and true,
        which aquafort can never attack and which never does damage to
        antimony glass, and is never damaged by experimentation of any
        sort. </p>
      <p>Note also that the Waldenburger flask must be well coated with
        a good luting material and subsequently carefully dried,
        otherwise it will break apart, so that the flask will not be
        preserved and the vapor will secretly be lost and the Oleum
        Salis will be greatly weakened, so that the Quintessence of the
        live mercury will be drawn of and lost. This is prevented as
        follows: Taking 1 pound of sublimed mercury, finely powdered and
        put into a well-luted flass flask, covered over with the above
        Oleum Slais and stoppered well, and heated 8 days, until the
        mercury is separated by distilling from the Oleum Salis. By
        heating very strongly the mercury, the residue in the glass
        becomes melted. After the fire is removed and the flask cooled,
        crystals form on the walls of the container. This is the
        Quintessence. </p>
      <p>The very fragile gold is also extracted from the tincture as
        follows: Taking 70 grams of Quintessence, made from the clear
        crystals, as noted above, and dissolving it in 40 grams of Oleum
        Salis, and adding a solution of 10 grams of finely pulverized
        gold dissolved in 70 grams of Oleum Salis, gave a product which
        was then treated with 10 grams of sal ammoniac and allowed to
        stand until all of it dissolved. The resulting solution was
        poured into a well-luted glass-stoppered flask and a
        distillation apparatus was attached to the flask. The material
        was distilled until dry and the dry residue was sublimed, at
        which time the Quintessence appears as red, and then blue,
        material. After cooling, the proceeding is identified as gold,
        the Quintessence. The dry product was allowed to stand on a
        glass plate in a warm spot until a red oil flows out. When the
        oil hardens, as was the case with earlier tinctures, then one
        part of this material was added to 10 parts of mercury, and when
        heated until fumes form, it becomes hard and is pure gold, which
        passes all tests for the same, for which God will eternally be
        praised and thanked, as He was also in the case of all other
        metals. </p>
      <p>The adhesive material used to coat the retort and the glass
        flask: Take the viscous adhesive material, which is neither
        sandy or gritty, moisten it with the water in which it had
        earlier been paced, add a handful of finely pulverized tartar,
        mixed with hair, horse manure, and common slat, until the
        adhesive material is very sticky. Pay careful attention that no
        sand or other impurities are included; store it under a retort
        or other glass vessel to become thoroughly dry before use or
        before setting near a fire. </p>
      <p><b>Mystery of Mysteries ~</b> </p>
      <p>Here begins one of the great mysteries of Nature, wherein are
        to be found great works of wonder. So say that philosophers and
        also the wise people of the world as well, about these Seeds:
        "Do you not know when you work in this way with metals that a
        heavenly influence according to one of God’s ordinances has been
        spoken to man and blends with earthly characteristics? When,
        now, the two happen in conjunction with each other, then an
        earthly pattern is formed, which underlies the origin and seeds
        of all metals”. When such a lack of understanding shall be
        stated that in the air there is a slat from which all creatures
        originate and grow and can be supported, without which nothing
        can take place and that one can, by the heat of the sunshine on
        the open field, one can obtain a beautiful white salt in all
        rooms and living quarters of his house and, furthermore, in salt
        free water in appropriate amounts, with which wonders can be
        accomplished, without doubt one can laugh defiantly and say
        about the whole matter: "This is very foolish talk, for nothing
        is accomplished by it and either of us would be a fool, since it
        is contrary to the truth when one wishes to proceed thereby": </p>
      <p>Take a perfectly round reflecting mirror, a weighing scale of
        proper size and depth so that the rays of the sun can be focused
        on a spot in the middle, then set up this mirror when the sun is
        giving of its hottest rays, under a cloudless sky; and allow it
        to stand several days, removing it at night, and protected from
        the wind and rain, and then a beautiful white salt forms in the
        middle of the mirror, which is shaved off by means of a knife in
        a clean glass and collected, in a short period of time it can
        amount to several ounces and then increase both in appearance
        and weight, and in this salt all 4 elements are found, from the
        air it has become conceivable when set in the sun’s heat that it
        flows like water, the fire brings out the taste, and when
        allowed to stand for a long period of time in decaying matter,
        it turned blood-red like a fiery red ruby. </p>
      <p>The water is allowed to stand in the hot sunshine in an open
        field or at home is a glass with an average fire under it, and
        then set in the hot sand, so the heat will draw the air into
        itself, and added to the coldwater in the glass. This water was
        then increased to a good amount and serves the Philosopher as
        his vinegar or solvent. This water also contains the 4 elements.
        From air it is turned into water. On concentrating by boiling,
        it turns into a fiery-red ruby. This water can be made to assume
        either a soft or hard form at will. And again it can serve as a
        very fine medicine for all sorts of illnesses. So, it is
        prepared for itself alone, or it can become the great Elixir of
        Nature (the secret remedy), which God Himself has ordained. Made
        by putrefaction and distillation, it will thus take effect more
        quickly and with it you can accomplish great wonders, as suits
        your pleasure. </p>
      <p><b>The Testing of This Salt ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take half an ounce of this salt and add 3 parts of water. Then
        pour it into a vial and set it in very warm water, where the
        salt will melt as ice does in water. Allow it to evaporate to
        about half of its original volume. Put the remaining volume in a
        clean glass flask and set it in a cold place. Then separate the
        completely white, transparent crystals which form, which melt as
        soon as they are allowed to warm up. The crystals are beautiful
        and sweet, and are placed in a silver dish and set on a sand
        bath. The gold leaf or silver leaf will now dissolve, so that
        one does not see anything remaining. This is the real Aurum
        Potabile (potable gold) and it can be used I very small dosages
        for all types of sickness, and even more, it will take care of
        everything better than a person would believe possible. </p>
      <p><b>Now For Particular Effects ~</b> </p>
      <p>Now take the gold, purified by the use of antimony and beat it
        as thin as possible or let it be put through a gold-beater to
        obtain as thin a gold leaf as possible, or as desired, and then
        add the crystallizing solution and then pulverize as much of it
        as desired. Then set it in a warm ash bath, whereupon the gold
        radical will dissolve, as will the silver. When the gold or
        silver has dissolved in the crystallizing water, then allow the
        solution to set in a dark place for 3 days. The glass flask must
        be well luted. Coagulation of a salt will then take pace in the
        flask and afterwards the solidified salt will again be added to
        water, as much as is deemed adequate. The gold is now in
        solution and will be blood-red, while the silver will be
        sky-blue. Then 1/2 pound or one pound of mercury is taken, or in
        any desired amount, after which there is much of the noble
        water. It is then poured onto the mercury, so that the latter is
        covered over to a depth of 2 or 3 fingers. As a result of this,
        the mercury will dissolve in the water. After solution, in which
        the gold is also dissolved, the mercury will be precipitated by
        a few more drops, added one after the other, and so will settle
        on the bottom. After decanting off the aqueous layer, then take
        up the mercury remaining as a residue and then drive it off from
        the lead, and as a result you will have the highest yield of
        gold that you can have, while in the ferment of silver, you have
        the most finely divided silver that can be seen by the naked
        eye. This is the uncontradicted truth that, as a matter of fact,
        even in this aqueous solution of gold, the copper, tin, and lead
        can be transmuted into gold, while the ferment of silver yields
        only silver. </p>
      <p><b>Now to the Principal Work ~</b> </p>
      <p>Now take the aqueous solution of gold and the gold after 7
        purifications and gradually add 3 times the amount of water
        necessary to fix the gold. Then place the well-luted flask in a
        bath or even in a kettle of warm water for the period of one
        month. It will then be as black as black velvet. Then take the
        flask from the water and set it in a warm ash bath. Then it will
        become white and fixed in a month. Then allow it to stand for 14
        days after which the resulting stone will have a bright red
        color in a strong fire, like a ruby, and will be transparent.
        Moreover, if you have God’s blessing, you will be able to
        accomplish by this technique a work which scarcely one person in
        10,000 will believe. </p>
      <p>Note well, this great work shall be kept secret to the end by
        the pledged word, so that it does not fall into unworthy hands,
        even if it requires overlooking a lot of misfortune and
        distress. </p>
      <p>Your everlastng enlargement is also: One dram poured out of its
        own water, that is to say, water of crystallization, 2 parts,
        allowed to stand 8 days in lukewarm water, then in hot water for
        an additional 8 days, then in even hotter water for a third
        stage, and even a fourth stage, until a stone is formed. The
        more often the heat is increased, the nobler the stone will be.
        In ths way, the process can be increased forever, for which yoou
        should love God and also help the poor. </p>
      <p>Note well, that the process described here, if allowed to fall
        into unworthy hands, will lead to nothing important at all. </p>
