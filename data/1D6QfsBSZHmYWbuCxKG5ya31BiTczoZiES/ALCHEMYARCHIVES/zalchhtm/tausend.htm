<p>Just before World War II, a controversial young man named Franz Tausend
entered into the industrial manufacture of gold. His business methods led
him to be accused of fraud, but there is some evidence that he actually
did realize the secret of low-energy transmutations of base metals to gold.
<p>Franz Tausend was born in 1884 at Krumbach in the province of Swabia,
Bavaria. His father was a tinsmith, and Franz learned the craft. His native
intelligence prompted his pastor and schoolmaster to petition for his admission
to a teachers’ training college. But Franz soon left that drear and transferred
to a Non-Commissioned Officers’ school. After three years, however, Tausend
left the school as a mere private. He went to work as a lab assistant in
a chemical factory until the beginning of World War I, during which he
was posted as a private at Metz.
<p>During his military service, Franz Tausend read all available chemistry
books and began to develop his own alchemical hypothesis of the structure
of matter. When he was discharged from the army at age 34 in 1919, Tausend
set to work to test his ideas on transmutation. In 1921 in Obermenzig (a
suburb of Munich), Franz experimented fruitlessly with processes for the
production of aluminum from clay, of morphia from salt, of nickel, and
a method for the cheaper manufacture of steel.
<p>Tausend moved his laboratory to Aubing, where he wrote a pamphlet entitled
‘180 Elements, Their Atomic Weight, and Their Incorporation in the System
of harmonic Periods’. His fundamental thesis held that each element possesses
a characteristic frequency of vibration which is related to the weight
of the nucleus and the layers of electrons surrounding it. His theory can
be compared to modern Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and other similar characteristic
identifications of elements and molecules. Tausend thought that transmutation
could be accomplished by comlementing or supplementing the frequencies
of elements by means of ‘symphonic’ wave interactions of light and sound,
thus to create new harmonics of matter.
<p>Contemporarily in September 1919, the eminent physicist A. Sommerfeld
declared a similar opinion: ‘What we now are able to learn from the language
of the spectra is really the spheral music of the atom, a harmony of whole-number
relations, a growing order and harmony despite all diversity’.
<p>Tausend formed his first company, Tausend –Reinhardt Gmbh, in 1923.
His 21-year old partner and general manager, Rudolf Reinhardt, was a law
student who invested 5000 marks of his own, and secured a loan of 100,000
marks from a Frau Schielbach at 24% interest and 50% of the company’s profits.
Tausend immediately spent 300,000 lire to purchase the Castle of Paschback
(near Eppau in the South Tyrol) as his laboratory, where the company entered
into the manufacture of zinc peroxide. Tausend also then married a pretty
young waitress to make a home with him in the castle. Tausend spent 25,000
marks to equip an experimental laboratory. One of his experiments with
a compound of lead exploded. When scraped off the walls, traces of gold
were obviously evident in the splashes of melt.
<p>Thus encouraged, Reinhardt advised Tausend to petition the government
with his process. The Bavarian Minister of Finance believed Tausend and
allowed experiments to be performed at the Munich Mint, but other officials
there objected. At this, Rudolf Reinhardt then went to the Imperial Chancellor’s
Office in Berlin, and convinced them to appoint a ‘Trustee of the German
People’, who was none other than General Erich von Ludendorff.
<p>General von Ludendorff had been acquitted as a co-conspirator with Adolf
Hitler in 1924, when Hitler was jailed for attempting to organize a putsch
in Munich. In 1925, the General ran for the office of President of the
German Republic, but he was roundly defeated by General Hindenburg. Thereafter
General Ludendorff offered his services as the Trustee requested by Tausend.
Ludendorff visited Tausend with a group of associates comprised of a chemical
engineer named Kummer, Alfred Mannesmann, a businessman, Herr Osthoff,
a banker, a merchant of Koln named Stremmel, and Franz von Rebay.
<p>Acting on Tausend’s instructions, Herr Stremmel bought the required
materials, which were melted by Kummer and von Rebay, then remelted by
the mixture in an electric furnace and added a bit of white powder. The
melt was cooled and the crucible broken to reveal a gold nugget which weighed
7 grams. Herr Stremmel had the gold assayed by a Munich jeweler who declared
it to be 23-carat quality. Unconvinced, Stremmel had the specimen tested
again in Berlin, with the same result; the gold was genuine and pure.
<p>In June, 1925, Franz Tausend and General Ludendorff concluded an agreement
in which the General received the usufruct of manufacturing synthetic gold
on behalf of the German Republic. But the agreement required ratification
by President Hindenburg, who refused to do so.
<p>On July 1, 1925, General Ludendorff made other, private arrangements
with Tausend, who renounced all rights to his discovery and swore to absolute
secrecy concerning the process. Furthermore, he assigned any further improvements
in the invention to General Ludendorff. On October 14, 1925, Tausend and
Ludendorff signed two contracts which were notarized by Munich Councillor
Schramm. One contract was to form a new Company 164 --- 164 being a code
for gold. The second contract was private with general Ludendorff, who
thereby secured all rights to Tausend’s discoveries.
<p>Tausend was to receive 5% of the profits, investors 12%, and General
Ludendorff’s ‘special collaborators’, who invested nothing, were to enjoy
8%. The General’s share was 75%, which money was to e spent on ‘patriotic’
goals --- the Nazi party.
<p>Ludendorff immediately proceeded to embezzle a large percentage of investment
money, and he introduced more ‘special collaborators’ who contributed nothing,
but claimed their 8%. In addition, they demanded to observe the process,
which by them was producing up to one ounce of gold in each experiment.
One collaborator, a chemist named Doering, learned the entire process and
then offered his services to the General, claiming that he could manufacture
gold too, and in larger amounts than Tausend. But Ludendorff remained ‘faithful’
to Tausend, so Doering left Company 164 to start his own business of manufacturing
gold.
<p>Excited investors put nearly one million marks into Company 164. These
persons included the Princes Hermann and Ulrich con Schonberg-Waldenburg,
each of whom invested 72,500 marks. A merchant named von Winkler, who invested
40,000 marks, begged Tausend for a bit of artificial gold with which to
make a bracelet for his mother, who was celebrating her golden wedding
anniversary with her husband. Tausend generously graced him with a gift
of 100 grams of gold.
<p>Tausend assured the investors that Company 164 already had 120 kilograms
of gold deposited in a Berlin bank, that he was soon to produce it by the
ton. But the investors were disturbed to see so much of their money ---
over 400,000 marks --- disappearing into General Ludendorff’s schemes.
<p>About this time, another of Tausend’s experiments exploded when gas
was admitted into the smelting furnace. Franz von Rebay and others of Ludendorff’s
confidants were present and scraped an ounce of gold from the walls of
the furnace.
<p>By December 1926, General Ludendorff had drained Company 164 to such
an extent that he deemed it prudent to withdraw from the business. He returned
all rights to the gold-manufacturing process --- and all of the company’s
debts --- to Tausend. Company 164 was dissolved, and on January 9, 1927
the Tausend Research Society was formed in Frankfurt to replace Company
164 and take over its phantom holdings. Chairman Tausend generously limited
the shareholders’ profits to 1500% of the original capital, ad allotted
15% of all new income to himself. The Society’s statutes warned that ‘All
members of the Society clearly understand that tier subscriptions are paid
in faith and without counter-security’.
<p>Two former subscribers to Company 164, Johann and Fritz Kuchenmeister
of Saxony had taken a bath I that venture and resolved to liquidate one
of their industrial assets, an obsolete textile mill, at Tausend’s expense.
They sold the building to Tausend for the exorbitant sum of 150,000 marks,
and there in Frieburg the alchemist wstablished his new laboratory.
<p>In November 1927, the merchant Stremmel of Koln, who had entered Germany
164 with General Ludendorff and remained as Tausend’s general manager,
resigned his post. He was replaced by Herbert von Oberwirzer, a Dresden
manufacturer. By this time, little more money was forthcoming from the
German industrialists, so Tausend went to Vienna to seek further funding
for his enterprise. Tausend successfully demonstrated his process to the
steel magnates Phillip and Richard von Schooler. They and others in the
so-called Vienna Group invested 235,000 marks and offered the use of three
blast furnaces&nbsp; (with a capacity of 60 tons each)for the production
of gold. But Tausend demurred, saying that such large-scale production
was premature at that time.
<p>On June 16, 1928, Franz Tausend made his first large-scale experiment
in manufacture of fold. A mixture of 750 grams of materials including lead
and borax was melted according to Tausend’s formula, and a few milligrams
of his secret catalyst, a white powder, was added. When the melt had nearly
reached the melting point of gold, the crucible was removed from the furnace
and examined. A yellow mass was visible beneath the original lead. The
crucible was heated again for 24 hours. The yield was 723 grams of gold
from 750 grams of base metals.
<p>The success of this experiment prompted Tausend to issue a series of
gold certificates valued at 10 kg each, or 25,000 marks. But a year later,
when no more gold was forthcoming, an investigation of fraud was made,
and Tausend was jailed while it ensued. During that time he was allowed
to perform an experiment under strict supervision at the Munich Mint, with
the understanding that he would be released if it was successful. The experiment
succeeded, but the expert witnesses disagreed so violently that their testimonies
were useless in court when the trial opened on January 19, 1931. On February
5, Tausend was convicted of fraud and sentenced to three years and eight
months imprisonment. After he was released, he disappeared from public
view.
<p>According to Scheff’s description of Tausend’s process, 111 grams of
lead chloride was fused under paraffin with 60 grams potassium hydroxide.
Then more KOH was added, and the solution kept molten. The melt was cooled
under vacuum.
<p>76 grams of potassium and&nbsp; 55 grams of sodium were fused under
paraffin, then 131.44 grams of mercury were added, and teh mixture heated
overnight,&nbsp; followed by another 365 grams of mercury. The crystallized
product was remelted.
<p>17.4 grams of the lead chloride-KOH product was reacted with 5.4 grams
of K-Na-Hg to yield 5.4 grams of gold.
<p>Another process employed 25.2 grams KOH and silica, heated on a waterbath.
After 5 minutes, 1.45 grams of iron oxide was added, and another 3.15 grams
of silica. The mixture was heated rd-hot for 90 minutes. Workup yielded
1.9 grams of gold.
<p>Tausend also employed other reagents in his experiments, but it is not
known how or why they were used: ammonium carbonate, lime, potassium nitrate,
soda, borax, sulfuric acid, and potassium cyanide, oxalic acid, uranyl
nitrate, aluminum chloride, potassium arsenide, lead sulfate, tin oxide,
silica, and asbestos.
