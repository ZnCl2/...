<center>
<p><b>To the Reader</b></center>

<p>Seeing not only the bad Success most Searchers of the Hermetick Art
meet with, but that likewise great Numbers of them are fallen into the
greatest Absurdities, as well in respect to their Operations, as to the
Matter they work upon, and often wishing to see some Remedy applied, to
recover those unhappy People from their Errors, it led me into a serious
Consideration of the Cause thereof; and I found that it was impossible,
those deluded Searchers could dwindle away into the absurderst Operations,
if they did not want a sufficient Theory of this Art.
<p>Then meditating further, and finding that the said Theory (which is
the main Pillar and Foundation to go upon) is not to be acquired but by
the constant Perusal of good Books; I at last begun to consider of those
Authors, which are Extant in the <i>English</i> Tongue, and found that
there really too few of them, and that it was chiefly to be attributed
to this Want, that People labour so much in vain, and so contrary to Nature.
<p>'This true, some, who only look upon the Number of Books, will think
there are Authors enough, nay, too many Extant that have written of the
Hermetick Art in the <i>English</i> Tongue; but others who have acquired
some Knowledge in their Divine Science, and who know to distinguish good
Authors from Sophisters, will easily allow, that there is a real Want of
them; for there are but few who wrote in the <i>English</i> Tongue, that
may be deemed as Maters, or at least by whom a seeker of this mysterious
Art may be instructed; so that, as to those sophistical Authors who have
encreased the Number of such Books, and treated of an Art which they did
not know, nor understood so much as any Part thereof, the more numerous
they are the more pernicious they prove to a Beginner who happens to read
them; for it is certain, that they may easily put him out of a right Path,
but can never lead him into a true Way.
<p>As for those that have been translated out of other Tongues, they are
but of little Use, when they have been translated, rather to serve some
private View, than to be instructive to those who Study this Science; especially
when they have been translated by Persons, who had no Knowledge of the
Terms and Operations in Chymistry; and I do not Question, but it will be
affirmed by all those, who (understanding the <i>German</i> Tongue) have
read <i>Basil Valentine</i> in his own Native Language, that the Translation
of that Volume which contains his Will and Testament, etc., differs widely
from the Original; nay, I believe I might easily convince the Lovers of
this Art, that the same is bad Translation of a bad Edition.
<p>Concerning others, I will say nothing against them, it not being my
Intention, to search for the Faults of other Translators. But finding from
the aforesaid Considerations, that to get some good Authors translated,
would be the most likely Means to furnish the Lovers and Studiers of this
Science with a sufficient Theory, and to make them do desist from their
unnatural Operations: I resolved to undertake the Work, and fixed upon
the following Treatises to be the first, that should appear in an <i>English</i>
Dress.
<p>The first of these Treatises was written by a <i>German</i> Philosopher,
under the Title of, THE ANCIENT WAR OF THE KNIGHTS, and was not only first
received, as coming from a good Author, and true Master, but all those
who had got any Knowledge in this Science: But the said Treatise did likewise
afterwards receive a Commentary, which another learned Philosopher has
made thereupon in <i>French</i>; who also after his instructive learned
Commentary has added six Keys, which for their Plainness and ingenious
Expressions give way to none, and are of the greatest Use imaginable to
s Studier of this Art.
<p>Thus the whole being an excellent Work, there is no doubt but those
who apply themselves to get Knowledge by reading good Authors, will find
infinite Benefit from the perusal of its; and the said Treatise called,
THE ANCIENT WAR OF THE KNIGHTS, being wrote in the <i>German</i> Tongue,
I have been at the Pains and Expences to get an Original thereof, that
so the Lovers of this Science might likewise have a Translation of the
same, and thus be able to draw Water from the Spirit itself; and also,
that by comparing it with the first, they might see and rectify such Passages
as have suffered by a second Translation.
<p>No Body will, I hope object, that the Style of this Work is not according
to the present Politeness, if he is so kind as to consider that it is not
intended for a Grammar, but to instruct People in the Hermetick Science,
which is for the most Part described in such difficult Terms, that the
unhappy Turn of one Word, may alter a whole Sentence, to the infinite Prejudice
of a Tyro; and that it is therefore better to keep the Author's Meaning
in a less agreeable Style, than to deviate from it, by using politer Expressions.
<p>'Tis likewise for the same Reason, that where the <i>German</i> has
a Word or Sentence which might bear a double Meaning or Signification,
both of them have been given, as for Instance: Where the War of the Knights,
at the End of this Book, translated from the <i>German</i> original, says
by <i>Num. 19. pag. 10. And if you two should mix your selves together,
and were kept in the Fire</i> - The original says indeed <i>in the Fire</i>,
but because the <i>Germans</i> speaking of Chymical Operations, and mentioning
<i>Fire</i>,
often mean <i>Digestion</i>, which is performed <i>byFire</i>; therefore
has been added [<i>or in Digestion,]</i> that so the Reader might have
both Meanings, and choose of the two which he should judge most proper.
<p>I could easily have added my Opinion upon several Passages in this Work,
as for Instance, <i>pag</i>. 41. where mention is made of the <i>Stars
of Venus and Diana</i>, which two Signs or Characters put together, produce
that which signifies <i>Mercury</i>; for if the Character of horned <i>Diana</i>
{crescent sign with edges turned upwards}, is placed upon that of <i>Venus</i>
{Venus sign}, it yields a Character in this Form {Mercury sign}. But I
omit it, lest I should be thought presumptuous in endeavouring to explain,
what I own I am not Master of.
<p>Should this my well-intended Labour meet with Approbation: I'll continue
it with Pleasure; and in Case the present Work should any way be wanting
in Exactitude, I'll use all Endeavours to make amends in the next.

<p><font size=+1>The Preface</font>
<p>Of the Author of the Commentary,
<br>Translated from <i>French</i>.
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</center>

<p><i>One is sufficiently persuaded, that there are already too many Books
which treat of the </i>Hermetick Philosophy<i>; and that unless one would
write of this Science plain, without Equivocation, and without Allegory,
(which none of the sages will ever do,) it would be better to remain silent,
than to fill the World with new Works, which rather serve to clog the spirit
[or Minds] of those who apply themselves to penetrate into the Philosophick
Mysteries, than to put them in the true Way, which leads to the desired
End, to which they aspire. 'Tis for this Reason that it has been thought,
that to interpret a good Author, who treats of this sublime Philosophy
with Solidity, would be more useful to the Children of Science, than some
new Philosophical Production, adorned with some of the most ingenious Expressions,
which the Adepts know to {?} when they treat of this great Art, or rather,
when they write only to make known, to those that seek it, that they have
had the good Fortune to arrive to the Possession thereof. Indeed most part
of the Philosophers which have wrote thereof, have done it rather to speak
of the good Success wherewith God had blessed their Work, than to give
the necessary Instruction to those who give themselves to the study of
this sacred science. This is so true, that most of them don't so much as
make any Difficulty of owning sincerely, that that has been their chief
View, when they compared their Books to that Matter.</i>
<p><i>The little Treatise which bears the Title, The </i>ANCIENT WAR OF
THE KNIGHTS,<i> has without any Contradiction deserved the Approbation
of all the Sages [or Wise Men] and of those, who have any Knowledge of
the Hermetic Philosophy. It is written by way of Dialogue, in a very plain
and measured Style, which bears every Way the marks of Truth; Yet notwithstanding
its Plainness, it is not wanting of Profundity, and to be solid in its
Reasoning, as also convincing in its Proofs, in such a manner, as also
convincing in its Proofs; in such a manner, that there is not one Word,
but what carries its Sentence, and on which there might not be made a long
Commentary.</i>
<p><i>This Works was composed in the </i>German<i> Tongue by a true philosopher,
whose Name is unknown. It appeared in Print at </i>Leipzig, <i>in the Year
of our Lord 1604. </i>Faber <i>of</i> Montpellier <i>translated it into
</i>Latin:
<i>And
it was from this </i>Latin<i> [Edition] that the French Translation was
taken, which was Printed at </i>Paris<i> by d'</i>Houry<i>, and put at
the End of [the Book called] the </i>French Turba,<i> of the Word left
behind</i> [verbum dismissum] <i>and of</i> Drebelius<i>,which together
make up one Volume. But whether</i> Faber<i> did not well understand the</i>
German <i>Tongue, or else did on Purpose falsify the Original: So it is,
that there are in these two Translations corrupted Passages, which are
so manifestly false, that they have occasioned, that many have condemned
this little Work, although it seemed otherwise to be very much informed.</i>
<p><i>As Truth and Falsehood cannot dwell together in one Subject, and
because it was easy to judge that Translations were not done faithfully,
a Philosopher of extraordinary Knowledge and Merit, did, for to satisfy
his Curiosity in this Point, give himself the Trouble, of seeking upwards
of ten Tears for to find the </i>German<i> original of this little Treatise,
and having at last found it, caus'd it to be exactly translated into </i>Latin.<i>
This new Translation is taken from that Copy, and done with all possible
Fidelity. The Goodness of the Original may be seen here, by the truth which
evidently appears in divers Places which have been restored [to its former
Sense,] which were not only alter'd but quite changed. One may judge of
this by the Passage marked thirty four, where the first Translation says,
like the </i>Latin <i>of</i> Faber, Mercurium nostrum nemo assequi potest;
nisi ex mollibus octo corporibus neque ullum absque altero parari potest.
No body can attain to our Mercury, otherways than out of the eight soft
Bodies, nor can the one be prepared without the other. <i>This Treatise
needed no other Thing, to be despised by those that have a sufficient knowledge
of the beginning of the [Philosophick] Work, in order to distinguish what
is true, from that which is false: The learned , however, did easily judge,
that such a capital Fault as that could not come from a true Philosopher,
who otherways gives sufficiently to know that he has perfectly understood
the Magistery: But there was wanting a zealous learned Man, for to discover
the Truth, an one that was as capable as the aforesaid, to make so great
a search for to find the Original of this Work; without which it was impossible
to re-establish true Sense thereof.</i>
<p><i>The place just now mentioned, was not the only one, that wanted to
be amended. If one takes the Pains to compare this new Translation with
the former, there will appear a very great Difference, and many material
Corrections. The passage thirty-five is not one of the least, and</i> as
this Translation has been from the new [or last] Latin <i>copy, without
ever looking upon that which was already printed in </i>French<i>, it has
been a pleasure to remark in course, all what was not conform to the same.</i>
<p><i>The Words in and entire Phrases, that have been added in some places
in the present, to make it join more natural, or render the Sense more
perfect, are placed betwixt two Crotches ( ), in order to distinguish what
is, and what is not in the Text, to which the Author of this Translation
has kept himself extremely close: By Reason, that the least Addition, to
a Matter of the Nature, may make a considerable Alteration [or Change]
and Occasion great errors.</i>
<p><i>The Beauty an the Solidity of this Treatise, did very well deserve
the Print which have been taken to make Commentary thereupon, to make it
more intelligible to the Children of the Art; [or Science;] because it
is a Treatise that may stand them instead of all others. And, as the Method
of a Dialogue it the most proper for to explain, and for to make palpable
the sublimest Truths, it has been made Use of here, and that with the more
Reason, in that the Author, upon which the Commentary has been made, has
written in the same manner. The Dialogue of</i> Eudoxe<i> and </i>Pyrophile<i>,
which explains the Dialogue of the </i>Stone<i>, with </i>Gold<i>, and
with </i>Mercury<i>, unfolds the chiefest Difficulties by its Question,
and by the Answers which are made thereto about the most material [or essential]
Points of the Hermetick Philosophy.</i>
<p><i>The Cyphers which are on the Margin of these two Dialogues, are to
remark the places which are alike in the first Dialogue, and the second
in which they are explained. There is to be seen in this work an entire
Conformity of Sentiments with the first Masters of this Philosophy, as
well as with the most learned that have written in the latter Ages, so
that there may hardly be found a Treatise upon this Matter, (how great
soever the Number thereof may be,) which is clearer, and more sincere than
the present, and which in Course could be more useful to such as apply
themselves to Study this Science, and who otherway have all the Qualifications
both of the Mind, and of the Body, which our Philosophy requires of those
who desire to make some Progress therein.</i>
<p><i>The Commentary, will doubtless, be allowed to be so much better in
that it is not diffusedly, as almost all Commentaries are: That it does
not touch upon any other Places than those which may be needed to be explained:
and that it does in no way deviate from the Subject; but as these sort
of Writings are not fit for those who have not yet gotten a Spark of the
secret Philosophy, the clearest sighted will easily find, that it has been
thought better to skip several Things, which perhaps might deserved an
Interpretation, than to explain generally all what might yet cause some
Difficulty to the young Beginner in the great Art.</i>
<p><i>As the first of these Dialogues tells the Victory of the</i> Stone<i>
and the other explains the Reason,a nd shows the Foundation of its Triumph:
It seemed that this Book could not appear under a more proper Title, than
that of the </i>Hermetical Triumph:<i> Or,</i> The Victorious Philosophical
Stone.<i> Nothing remains to be said, except that the Author of the Translation
(who is likwise the same of the Commentary, and of the Letter which is
at the End of this Book) has had no other Interest of View in this, but
to manifest the Truth to those who aspire to the Knowledge of it, from
such Motives as are proper to the true Children of the Science: He also
declares, and protects sincerely, that he desires with all his Heart, that
those who are so unfortunate as to lose their time in working with foreign
or distant Matters, may find themselves enlightned by reading this Book,
in order to know the true and only Matter of the Philosophers; and that
those who know the same already, but are ignorant of the great Point, </i>viz.<i>
the Solution of the </i>Stone<i>, and the Coagulation of the Water, and
of the Spirit of the Body, which is the Term [or End] of the Universal
Medicine, may here learn those secret Operations, which are distinctly
enough described for them.</i>
<p><i>The Author has not thought proper to write in </i>Latin<i>, because
he could not believe, like many others, that to treat of these high Mysteries
in a vulgar Tongue, is to reveal them: He has followed the Example of several
Philosophers, who were resolved, that their Work [or Treatise] should bear
the [said] Character of their Country. His first Design has likewise been
to be useful to his Countrymen, not doubting, but that if this Treatise
should appear to the Disciples of</i> Hermes<i> to have any deserts, there
would be found such as will translate it into such a Language as they please.</i>

<br>
<br>
<p>Translated from the <i>French.</i> It ought not to be expected to find
here a particular Explication, such as should undraw the Curtains which
are spread over the philosophick Enigma, for to show the Truth quite naked;
for if that were [done], there would remain nothing more to be done but
to burn all the Writings of the Philosophers: The Wise would not have any
more Advantage over the Ignorant; the one an the other would be equally
skilled in this wonderful Art.
<p>It ought therefore to be thought sufficient to see in this Figure, as
in Looking-Glass, the Abridgement of the whole secret Philosophy, which
is contained in this little Book, in which all the Parts of this Emblem
are explained as clear as it is permitted to be done.
<center><img SRC="hermtriu.gif" height=566 width=427></center>

<p>Those that are initiated in the Philosophick Mysteries, will easily
and presently comprehend the Sense which is hid under this Figure. But
these who have not these Lights, must here consider in general a mutual
Correspondence betwixt the Heavens and the Earth, by Means of the Sun an
Moon, who are like the secret Ties of this Philosophical Union.
<p>They will see in the Practice of the Work, who parabolical Rivulets,
who confounding [or mixing] themselves secretly together, give Birth to
the mysterious Triangular Stone, which is the Foundation of the Art.
<p>They will see a secret and natural Fire, of which the Spirit penetrating
the Stone, sublimes it in Vapours, who condense themselves in the Vessel.
<p>They will see what Efficacy the sublimed Stone receives of the Sun and
Moon, who are its Father and Mother, of whom it inherits presently its
first Crown of Perfection.
<p>They will see in the Continuation of the Practice [or in the Progress
of the Work,] that the Art gives to this Divine Liquor a double Crown of
Perfection, by the Conversion of Elements, and by the Extraction and the
Depuration of the Principles, by which it becomes to be that mysterious
Rod of <i>Mercury</i>, which operates such surprising Metamorphosings.
<p>They will see that this same <i>Mercury</i>, as a <i>Phoenix</i>, who
takes a new Birth in the Fire, arrives by the Magistery to the last Perfection
of the fixed Sulphur of the Philosophers, which gives it a foreign Power
over the three Genders&nbsp; of Nature; of which the three-fold Crown (upon
which is set for this Purpose the Hieroglyphic Figure of the World) is
the most material Character.

<br><b><font size=+1>A DISCOURSE between <i>Stone</i> of the <i>Philosophers</i>,
and <i>Gold, </i>and <i>Mercury</i>.</font></b></center>

<p>Concerning the true Matter from whence those who are acquainted with
the <i>Secrets</i> of <i>Nature, </i>may make the <i>Philosophical Stone</i>,
according to the <i>Rules</i> of a proper <i>Practice,</i> and by the help
of <i>Lunatic Vulcan.</i>
<p>Composed Originally in the German Tongue by a very able <i>Philosopher</i>,
and newly translated from the <i>Latin </i>into <i>French., </i>now from
the <i>French</i> render'd into <i>English.</i>
<p>The Subject of this Discourse is a Dispute which <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i>
had one Day with the Stone of the Philosophers. See here in what manner
a true Philosopher speaks, (who is arrived at the Possession of this great
Secret.)
<p>I protest unto you before God, and upon the (eternal) Salvation of my
Soul, with a sincere Heart, touch'd with Compassion for those who have
been a long while in this great search; and (I give you notice,) all you
who Esteem this wonderful Art, that our whole Work takes its Nativity {1}
from one only thing, and that in this thing the Work finds its Perfection,
without having need of any other thing, whatsoever, but to be dissolved
{2} and coagulated, which it must do of it self, without the Assistance
of any foreign Thing.
<p>When we put Ice into a Vessel placed on the Fire, we see that Heat makes
it dissolve into Water; {3} we must use the same way with our Stone, which
only wants the help of the Artist, the Operation of this hands, and the
action of the {4} natural Fire: For it will never be dissolved of it self,
though it should remain for ever on the Earth, 'tis for that reason we
must assist it; in such a manner, however, that we add nothing to it, which
is foreign or contrary to it.
<p>Just as God produces the Corn in the Fields, and that it afterwards
belongs to us to reduce it into Metal, to knead it, and make Bread of it:
In like manner our Art requires us to do the same thing {5}. God has created
us this Mineral; to the end, that we should take it by it self, that we
should uncompound or dissolve the Composition of the gross and thick Body;
that we should separate and take for our selves whatever good it encloses
inwardly, that we reject what it has of superfluous, and that our of a
(mortal) Poison, we learn to make a (Sovereign) Medicine.
<p>To give you a more prefect understanding of this agreeable Discourse;
I will recite to you the Dispute which arose between the Stone of the <i>Philosophers,
Gold,</i> and <i>Mercury; </i>so that those who have a long time apply'd
themselves to the search (of our Art) and who know how we ought to deal
with {6} Metals and Minerals, may be thereby sufficiently informed how
to arrive directly at the End which they propose to themselves. 'This nevertheless
necessary, that we should apply our selves to know {7} exteriorly, and
interiorly, the Essence and the Properties of all things which are on the
Earth, and that we penetrate into the Profundity of the Operations, which
Nature is capable of.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Recital</font></b></center>

<p><i>Gold </i>and <i>Mercury </i>went on Day, with an armed Hand, to (give
Battle unto, and) subdue the Stone. <i>Gold</i> animated with Fury, begun
to speak thus:
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>How have you the Boldness to raise your self above me, and my brother
<i>Mercury</i>,
and to pretend a Preference before us; you who are only a {8} Worm (swollen)
with Poison? Do you not know that I am the most precious, the most durable,
and the chief of all the Metals? (know you not) that Monarchs, Princes,
and Nations, do alike make all their Riches to consist in me, and in by
brother <i>Mercury</i>, and that you are on the contrary, the (dangerous)
enemy of Men, and of Metals; so that the (most able) Physicians cease not
publish and extol the (singular) Vertues which I possess {9} to give (and
preserve) Health to all the World?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>To these Words (full of Anger) the Stone answer'd (without being moved,)
my dear Gold, why are you not rather angry with God, and why do you not
ask him, for what Reasons he has not created in you what is found in me?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>'This God himself who has given me the Honour, the Reputation, and the
glittering Brightness, which renders me so estimable, it is for that Reason
that I ma so searched for by every one. One of my greatest Perfections
is to be a Metal unchangeable in the Fire, and our of the Fire: So all
the World loves me, and runs after me; but you, you are only a {10} Fugitive,
and a Cheat, that abuses all Men: This se seen in that, that you fly away
and escape out of the Hands of those who work with you.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>'This true, my dear <i>Gold</i> , 'tis God who has given you the Honour,
the Durability, and the Beauty, which makes you precious; 'tis for that
Reason that you are obliged to return (eternal) Thanks (to the divine Bounty,)
and not to despise others as you do; for I can tell you, that you are not
that <i>Gold</i>, o which the Writings of the <i>Philosophers</i> make
mention; {11} but the <i>Gold</i> is hidden in my Bosom. 'Tis true, I own
it, I flow in the Fire (and abide not there,) nevertheless you very well
know, that God and Nature have given me this Quality, and that this must
be so; for as much as my Fluidity turns to the advantage of the Artist,
who knows {12} the way how to extract it; know, nevertheless, that my Soul
remains constant in me, and that she is more stable, and more fixt than
you are, altogether <i>Gold</i> as you are, and more than are your Brother,
and all your Companions are. Neither Water, nor Fire, be they what they
will, can destroy her, nor consume her; though they should act upon her
during as long time as the World shall last.
<p>'This not then my Fault if am sought for by Artists, who know not how
they ought to work with me, nor in what way I ought to be prepared. They
often mix me with foreign Things, which are (entirely) contrary to me.
They add to me Water, Powders, and such other like things, which destroy
my nature, and the Properties which are essential to me; so that there
is hardly found one in a Hundred {13} who works with me. They apply themselves
to search our the (Truth of the) Art in you, and in your Brother Mercury
'tis for that Reason that they all err, and 'tis therein that their Work
are false. They are themselves a (good) Example of it; for 'tis unprofitably
that they employ their <i>Gold</i>, and that they endeavour to destroy
it; there remains nothing to them from all that, but extreme Poverty, to
which they see themselves as last reduced.
<p>'Tis you, <i>Gold</i>, who art the <i>first</i> cause (of this ill Fortune;)
you very well know, that without me it is impossible to make any <i>Gold</i>,
or any <i>Silver</i>, which shall be perfect, and that it is I alone who
have this (wonderful) Advantage. Why therefore do you permit almost all
the whole World to lay the Foundation of their Operations upon you, and
upon <i>Mercury</i>? If you had yet any remainder of Honesty, you'd hinder
Men from abandoning themselves to a most certain Loss; but as (instead
thereof) you do quite the contrary, I may with Truth maintain, that it
is you only who are a Cheat.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>I will convince you by the Authority of the <i>Philosophers</i>, that
the Truth of the Art may be accomplished with me. Read <i>Hermes</i>, he
says thus: "The Sun is its Father, and the Moon {14} its Mother; now I
am the only one which they compare to the Sun.
<p><i>Aristotle, Avicenna, Pliny, Serapion, Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Masue,
Rasis, Averroes, Geber, Raymund Lully, Albertus Magnus, Arnold</i> of <i>Villa
Nova, Thomas Aquinas, </i>and a great Number of other <i>Philosophers</i>,
whom I pass in Silence, that I may not belong, do all write clearly and
distinctly, that the Metals and the (physical) Tincture, are not made but
of <i>Sulphur</i> and of <i>Mercury</i> {15} that this <i>Sulphur</i> ought
to be red, incumbustible, steadfastly resisting the Fire; and that the
<i>Mercury</i>
ought to be clear [or bright,] and well purified. In this manner they speak
without any reserve; they name me openly by my proper Name and say, that
in <i>Gold</i>, (that is to say in me) there is found the red digested,
fixt, and incumbustible <i>Sulphur</i>; which is true, and very evident;
for there is no Body who does not know well, that I am a Metal, the most
durable (an unalterable) that I am endowed with a perfect
<i>Sulphur</i>,
and intirely fixt, over which the Fire has no power.
<p><i>Mercury</i> was of the same Opinion with <i>Gold</i>, he approv'd
of this Discourse maintained that all which his Brother said was true,
and that the Work might be perfected after the manner which the <i>Philosophers</i>
herein above-cited have written. He added also, that every one (sufficiently)
knew how great a (mutual) {16} Friendship there was between <i>Gold</i>
and him, preferably before all the other Metals; that there was no Body
who could not easily judge thereof by the Testimony of this own Eyes, that
the <i>Goldsmiths</i>, and other such like Artificers knew very well, that
when they would gild any work, they could not do without gild and work,
they could not do without (a mixture of) <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i>,
and that they make a Conjunction of them in a very small time, without
difficulty, and with very little Labour; what ought not to be hop'd for
with more Time, more Labour, and more Application?

<p>At this Discourse, the Stone begun to Laugh, and told them, in Truth
you deserve both the one and the other of you, that they should jeer you,
and your Demonstration; but it is you <i>Gold</i> that I still the more
admire at, seeing that you are so much conceited of your self, for having
the advantage which you have to be good for some certain Things. Can you
be perswaded that the ancient <i>Philosophers</i> did write as they have
done, in a Sense which should be understood in a common Way? And do you
believe that one ought plainly to interpret their Words according to the
Letter?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>I am certain, that the <i>Philosophers</i>, and the Artists, whom I
cited, have not written a Lie. They are all of the same Sentiment concerning
the Vertue which I possess: 'Tis very true that there are found some who
would search in Things quite distant, for the Power and the Properties
which are in me. They have workt on certain Herbs, on Animals, on Blood,
on Urines, on Hair, on Sperm, and on Things of this Nature; these have
without doubt stray'd from the true way, and have sometimes written Falshoods:
But it is not so of those Masters whom I have named. We have certain Proofs,
that they effectually possest this (great) Art; 'tis for that Reason that
we ought to give credit to their Writings.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>I do not make any doubt at all of (those <i>Philosophers</i>) having
had an intire Knowledge of the Art; excepting, nevertheless, some of those
whom you have alledged; for there are among them, though a very few, some
who knew it not, and have only written what the have heard People say of
it: But when they (the true <i>Philosophers</i>) plainly name <i>Gold</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>, as the Principles of the Art, they only make Use of
these Terms thereby to hide the Knowledge from the Ignorant, and from those
who are unworthy (of this Science;) for they very well know that such (vulgar)
Wits mind only the names of things, the Receipts, and the Processes which
they find written, without examining whether there be any (solid) Foundation
in what they put into Practice. But the wise Men, and those who read (good
Books) with Application and Exactness, consider all Things with Prudence,
examine how consonant and how agreeing one Thing is with another; and by
these means they penetrate into the Foundation (of the Art,) so that by
Reasoning, and by Meditation, they discover (at length) what the matter
of the <i>Philosophers</i> is, among whom there is not any one to be found
who would show it, of make it known openly, and by its proper Name.
<p>They declare themselves plainly about it, when they tell ye, that they
never reveal less (of the Secret) of their Art, than when they speak openly,
an in the common way (of delivery:) But (they affirm) on the contrary {17},
that whne they use Similitudes, Figures, and Parables, it is in Truth in
those places (of their Writings) that they disclose their Art; for (the
<i>Philosophers</i>)
after having discours'd of <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, fail not of
declaring afterward and assuring us, that their <i>Gold</i> is not the
common <i>Sol </i>(or <i>Gold</i>) and the their <i>Mercury</i> is not
the common <i>Mercury</i>; see here the Reason.
<p><i>Gold</i> is a perfect Metal, which by Reason of its Perfection (which
Nature has given it) cannot be carried further (by Art) to a more perfect
Degree; so that in what way soever one may work with <i>Gold</i>, whatever
Artifice one makes use of; though one should Extract its Colour (and its
Tincture) a hundred Times, the Artist will never make more <i>Gold</i>,
and shall never tinge a greater Quantity of Metal, than there was of Colour
and Tincture in the <i>Gold</i> (from whence it shall have been Extracted;)
for this Reason it is that the <i>Philosophers</i> say, that we ought to
seek Perfection {18} in the imperfect Things, and that we shall find it
there. You may read in the Rosary what I have told you here. <i>Raymund,
Lully,</i>whom you have cited to me, is of the same Sentiment (he assures)
that, that which ought to be made better, ought not to be prefect; because
in what is perfectt, there is nothing to be changes; and one shal sooner
destroy its Nature, (than add any Thing to its Perfection).
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>I am ignorant, that the <i>Philosophers</i> speak after this manner;
yet this may be apply'd to my Brother <i>Mercury</i>, who is as yet imperfect;
but if one join both of us together, he then receives from the Perfection
(which he wants:) For he is of the <i>Feminine</i> sex, and I am of the
<i>Masculine</i>
Sex; which makes the <i>Philosophers</i> say, that the Art is one quite
homogeneal Thing. You see an Example hereof in (the Procreation of) Men,
for there can no Child be Born without (the Copulation of) Male and Female;
that is to say, without the Conjunction of the one with the other. We have
the like Example thereof in Animals, and in all living Beings.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>'Tis true, your Brother <i>Mercury</i> is imperfect {19}, and by consequence
he is not the <i>Mercury</i> of the wise. So though you should be join'd
together, and one should keep you thus in the Fire during the Course on
many Years, to endeavour to unite you perfectly to one another, there will
always happen (the same Thing, namely,) that as soon as the <i>Mercury</i>
feels the Action of Fire, it separates it self from you, it is sublimed,
it flies away, and leaves you alone below. That if one dissolve you in
<i>Aqua
fortis</i>, if one reduce you into one only (Mass), in one melt you, you
will never produce any Thing but a Powder, and a red Precipitate: That
if one make a Projection of this Powder on an imperfect Metal, it tinges
it not; but one finds as much <i>Gold</i> as one put therein at the beginning,
and your Brother <i>Mercury</i> quits you and flies away.
<p>See here, these are the Experiments, which those who apply themselves
to the Search of <i>Chymistry</i> have made to their great Damage, during
a long Train of Years: See also (where there endeth) all the Knowledge
which they have acquired by their Words, but because there is a Saying
of the Ancients, whereof you would make use to your Advantage, that the
Art is all one (entire) homogeneal Thing; that no Child can be Born without
Male and Female; and that you imagine to your self, that the <i>Philosophers</i>
do thereby intend to speak of you and your Brother <i>Mercury</i>; I ought
to tell you (plainly) that this false, and that it is understood much amiss
concerning you, though in the same Places the <i>Philosophers</i> speak
sincerely, and tell the Truth. I make it known to you, that here {20} lies
the corner (angular) Stone, which they have laid, and at which many Thousands
of Men have stumbled.
<p>Can you well imagine to your self, that it should be the same {21} with
Metals, as with Things which have Life. There happens to you in this, that
which happens to all false Artists: for when you read (such like Passages)
in the <i>Philosophers</i>, you apply not your selves any more to examine
them, to endeavour to discover whether (such Experience) square and agree
together, or not, with what has been said before, or that is said afterward:
Yet (you ought to know) that all which the <i>Philosophers</i> have written
in figurative Terms about the Work, ought to be understood of me only,
and of no other Thing which is in the World; because there is only me who
can perform that which they say, and that {22} without me it is impossible
to make any true <i>Gold</i>, of any true <i>Silver.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>Good God! have you no Shame of telling so great a lie? And do you not
think you commit a Sin, in boasting your self to such a Height, as to dare
to attribute to sour self alone, all which so many wise and knowing Men
have written of this Art, for so many Ages; you who are only a thick, impure,
and poisonous Matter: And you acknowledge, notwithstanding this, that this
Art is all one (perfectly) Homogeneal Thing? You say further, that without
you, one can make no true <i>Gold</i>, not true <i>Silver</i>, as being
an universal Thing {23}. (Is there not a manifest Contradiction there?)
For as much as many knowing Persons have applied themselves with so much
Care and Exactness to those (curious) Searches, which they have made, that
they have found out other ways (<i>viz</i>.<i> </i>Process) which they
call Particulars, from which, nevertheless, one may draw great Gain.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>My dear <i>Gold</i>, be not surprised at what I am going to tell you,
and be not so imprudent as to impute a Lie to me; to me, who am {24} older
than you: If so be I were indeed mistaken in this Point, you'd have Reason
to excuse my (great) Age; since you are not Ignorant that old Age should
be respected.
<p>But to convince you that I have spoken Truth; in order to defend my
Honour, I will rely on no other but (the Authority) of the same Masters
whom you have quoted, and whom for that Reason you have no Right to refuse.
(For instance,) <i>Hermes</i> in particular says thus: It is true without
Lie, certain and very true, That that which is below, is like unto that
which is above; and that which is above, is like unto that which is bellow;
{25} 'tis by these Things that one may make the Miracles of only one Thing.
<p><i>Aristotle</i> says: O how admirable is this Thing, which contains
in it self Things which we have need of. It kills is self; and afterwards
it reassumes a Life of it self; {26} it espouses it self; it impregnates
it self; it is born of it self, it dissolves it self in its own Blood;
it coagulates it self again with it, and takes a hard Consistence; it makes
it self White, and it rubifies it self, of it self; we add nothing more
to it, and we change nothing in it, except that we separate the <i>Grossness</i>
and the Terrestreity}.
<p>Pluto speaks of me in this manner: It is one only single Thing, of one
and the same Species in it self; {27} it has a Body, a Soul, a Spirit,
and the four Elements, over which it has Dominion, it wants nothing; it
has no need of other Bodies; for it ingenders it self; all Things are from
it, by it, in it.
<p>I could here bring you many other Testimonies, but it being unnecessary,
I pass them over in Silence, that I may not be tedious. However, since
you happen to speak to me of (<i>Process</i>, or) Particulars, I'll explain
to you in what they differ (from the Art) {28}, some Artists who have wrought
with me, have carried on their Works so far, that they succeeded so far
as to separate from me my Spirit, which contains my Tincture; so that mixing
it with other Metals and Minerals they arriv'd thus fat, that they communicated
a final part of my Vertus, and of my Power to such Metals as have some
Affinity and Friendship with me. Yet these Artists who have succeeded in
this way, and who have indeed found one Part (of the Art,) are really but
a very small Number: but as they knew not {29} the Original whence the
Tinctures come, it was impossible for them to carry on their Works beyond
that; and at the casting up of their Accounts, they have found no vast
Profit in their Proceeding. But if these Artists had carried on their Search
further, and that they had well examined with is the {30} Wife who is proper
for me; and that they had fought for her, and united me with her; then
could have ting'd a thousand Times (more;) but (instead of that) they entirely
destroyed my own Nature, by mixing me with foreign Things; 'tis truly for
that Cause, that at the making up of their Accounts, they have found some
Gain, however, but indifferent, in comparison of the great Power which
is in me; 'tis apparent, nevertheless, that (this Gain) did not proceed,
nor had its Original, but from me, and not from any other Thing whatsoever
(wherewith I might be mixed).
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>What you have said is no sufficient Proof; for though the <i>Philosophers</i>
speak of one only Thing, which encloses it is self the four Elements; and
which [Thing] has a Body, a Soul, and Spirit; and that by this Thing they
would give us to understand the (Physical) Tincture; at such time when
the same has been carried on to its highest (Perfection) which is the Point
they aim at; yet this Thing ought at its beginning to be composed of me,
who am the <i>Gold</i>, and of my Brother <i>Mercury</i>, as being (both
together) the Male Seed, and the Female Seed; as has been said before:
For after we have been sufficiently cook'd, and transmuted into a Tincture,
we are then both the one and the other (together) the one only Thing which
the <i>Philosophers</i> speak of.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Stone</font></b></center>

<p>That goes not as you fancy; I have already told you before, that no
true Union can be made of you two; for you are not the only Body {31},
but two Bodies together; and consequently you are contrary, considering
the Foundation of Nature: but as for me, I have an {32} imperfect Body,
a steadfast Soul, a penetrating Tincture. I have, besides this, a clear,
transparent, volatile, and moveable <i>Mercury</i>: And I can operate all
those (great) Things, which you boast of with you both, and which however
you are not able to perform: For 'tis I who carry the <i>Philosophical
Gold</i>, and the <i>Mercury</i> of the Wise (Men) in my Body; wherefore
the <i>Philosophers</i> (speaking of me) say, our Stone {33} is Invisible,
and it is not possible to attain to the Possession of our <i>Mercury</i>,
any other way than by Means of {34} two Bodies, whereof one cannot receive
without the other the (requisite) Perfection.
<p>'Tis for this Reason the there is no other but only my self, who possesses
a Male and a Female Seed, and who is (at the same time) a Thing (entirely)
Homogeneal; also am I call'd an <i>Hermaphrodite. Richardus Anglicus</i>
witnesses of me, saying, the first Matter of our Stone is call'd <i>Rebis</i>
(twice a Thing) that is to say, a Thing which has received from Nature
a double occult property, which is the Reason that the name of <i>Hermaphrodite</i>
is given to it, as if one would say, a Matter, whereof it is difficult
to be able to distinguish the Sex (and to diccover) whether it be a Male,
or a Female, it inclining equally to both Sides: The (Universal) Medicine
is therefore made of a Thing which is {35} the Water, and the Spirit of
the Body.
<p>This has given Occasion to the saying, that his Medicine has deceived
a great number of Fools, by Reason of the Multitude of <i>Enigma</i> (under
which it is hid;) nevertheless this Art requires but only one Thing, which
is known by every one, and which many do with for; and the whole is a Thing,
which has not its equal in the World; {36} it is however cheap, and to
be had at small Expense: It ought not to be despised for that; for it makes
and perfects wonderful things.
<p><i>Alanus</i> the <i>Philosopher</i> says, you that work in this Art,
ought to have a firm and constant Application of Mind to your Work, and
not to go about to try sometimes one Thing, sometimes other. The Art consists
not in a Plurality of Species; but in the Body, and in the Spirit. Oh!
how true it is, that the Medicine of our Stone is one Thing, one Vessel,
one Conjunction. All the Artifice begins by one Thing, and ends by one
Thing, altho' the <i>Philosophers</i>, with a Design to conceal this (great
Art) describe several ways, <i>viz.</i> a continual Conjunction, a Mixing,
a Sublimation, a Desiccation, and as many other (Ways and Operations) more,
as may be named by different Names: But {37} the Dissolution of the Body
is not made, but in its own Blood.
<p><i>Geber</i> says thus: There is a <i>Sulphur</i> in the Profundity
of <i>Mercury</i>, which cooks it, and which digests it in the Vein of
the Mines, during a very long time. Thus you see my dear Gold, that I have
fully demonstrated to you, that this <i>Sulphur</i>is only in me; because
I do all my self alone, without your help, and without that of all your
Brother, and of all your Companions. I have no Need of you, but all have
Need of me, for as much as I can give Perfection to you all, and raise
you all above the State, which Nature has plac'd you in.
<p>At these last Words, the <i>Gold</i> grew furiously enrag'd, not knowing
what to answer any further; he concluded (however) with his Brother <i>Mercury</i>,
and they agreed together, that they would assist one another, (hoping)
that they being two against our Stone, which is but one alone, they might
easily overcome it; so that after not having been able to conquer it by
disputing, they took a Resolution to put it to Death by the Sword. In this
design they join'd their Forces, to make them the stronger by uniting double
Power.
<p>Battle was given: Out Stone display'd its Force and its Valour; fought
them both, {38} overcame them, destroy'd them, and swallowed up both the
one and the other; in a manner that there remained so sign, whereby one
might know what was become of them.
<p>Thus, dear Friends, who have the fear of God before your Eyes, what
I tell you ought to make you know the Truth, and illuminate your Minds
as much as is necessary to understand the Foundation of the greatest and
the most predious of all Treasures, which no <i>Philosopher</i> has so
clearly explained, discovered, or brought to Light.
<p>You have then no need of any Thing else. This only remains, that you
pray to God, that he would make you arrive at the Possession of the Jewel,
which is of an inestimable Value. Next to this, sharpen your Mind, read
the Writings of the Wise with Prudence; work with Diligence (and Exactness,)
act not rashly in so precious a Work. {32} It's time is ordained by Nature;
in the like manner as the Fruits which are on the Trees, and as the Bunches
of Grapes the Vine does bear. Be upright of Hearth, and propose to your
self (in your Work) an honest End; otherwise God will grant you nothing;
{40} for the doth not communicate (so great) a Gift, except to those who
will make a good use of it; and he depriveth them thereof, who design to
make use of it to commit Evil. I pray to God that he may give you his (holy)
Blessing. <i>Amen.</i>

<p>Most happy Moment, that brings me so lucky to meet you here! I have
for a long time most earnestly wish'd for an opportunity of entertaining
you with the Progress I have made in <i>Philosophy</i>, by reading those
Authors, you advised me to read, to instruct me fundamentally in the Divine
Science, which by way of Excellency is call'd <i>Philosophy</i>.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>The seeing you thus again, gives me no less Joy, and that will still
be increased by Learning the Advantages you have gained by your Application
to the Study of our sacred Science.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I shall be indebted to you, not only for all that I now know of it,
but likewise for what I shall hope to penetrate in the <i>Sophick</i> Mysteries,
if you will please to continue to lend me the Assistance of your Knowledge.
It was you that inspired me with all the needful Courage, to undertake
a Study, whose fist Difficulties appeared impenetrable; and of a Nature,
continually to blunt the Points of Wits, that are most acute in the search
of hidden Truth: But thanks to your good Counsel, I find my self by the
more animated to pursue my Enterprize.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>I am pleased, that I have not been mistaken in the Judgment of the Character
of your mind, you have it of the temper it ought to be of, for acquiring
that Knowledge that surmounts the Capacity of an ordinary Genius, and not
to soften under so many Difficulties as renders the Sanctuary of our <i>Philosophy</i>
almost unaccessible. I very much applaud that Force with which I know you
have combated the usual Discourses of certain Wits, who think themselves
concerned in honour to treat as <i>Whimsey</i> and <i>Chimera</i>, whatever
they do not understand, because they are unwilling is should be said, that
others can discover Truths of which they have no knowledge.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I never thought there was much Attention due to the Reasoning of such
as will decide in Things they understand not; but I confess to you, that
had any thing been able to turn me from a Science, for which I have ever
had a strong natural Inclination, it would have been that sort of Shame
that Ignorance hath fastned upon Inquiries into the <i>Philosophy: </i>It
is really troublesome to be obliged to hide ones Application to it; as
one must either do, or pass in the Opinion of the World, for a Man that
busies himself in vain <i>Chimera's</i>; but as Truth where-ever it is,
hath inestimable Charms for me, nothing has had the Power to divert me
from this Study. I have read the Writings of a great many <i>Philosophers</i>,
no less considerable for their Learning, than for their Probity; and as
it could never enter into my Thoughts, that so great Personages were so
many public Impostors, I would needs examine their Principles with serious
Attention, and was convinced of the Truths they advance, altho' I pretend
not to comprehend them all.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You oblige me much by the Justice you render to the Masters of our Art;
but pray tell me, what <i>Philosophers</i> you have particularly read,
and which are those that have given you most Satisfaction? I contended
my self with recommending to you only some few.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>To reply you your demand, I should make a long Catalogue, for I have
read the <i>Philosophers</i> many years without ceasing. I have sought
Knowledge in its Source, I have read the smaragdine Table, the seven Chapters
of <i>Hermes</i> with their Commentaries: I have read <i>Geber, </i>the
<i>Turba,
Rosary, Theatrum, Bibliotheque, Chymial Cabinet, </i>and particularly
<i>Artephius,
Arnold de villa nova, Raymond Lully, Trevisan, Flamel, Zachary,
</i>and
many others, Antient and Modern, whom I name not; among others,
<i>Basil
Valentine, Cosmopolite, </i>and <i>Philaletes.</i>
<p>I assure you I was terribly put to it, to try to find the essential
Point in which they all should agree, they making use of Expressions so
differing, and often, seem to be opposite. Some speak of the Matter in
abstracted Terms compounded: Some express only certain Qualities of the
Matter; other stick upon quite different Properties; some consider it in
a State purely natural, others speak of it in a State of some of the Perfections
it receives from Art; And all this together flings one into such a Labyrinth
of Difficulties, that it is no wonder that most of those who read the <i>Philosophers</i>,
do form quite different Conclusions.
<p>I did not content my self to read the chief Authors you directed me
to barely once over; I read them over again an again, even as often as
I thought I could draw new Instructions from them, either as to the true
Matter, or as to its divers Preparations, whereon depends the whole Success
of the Work. I have made Extracts from all the best Books. I have meditated
thereon Day and Night, until I thought I knew the Matter, and its different
Preparations, which Property is but one and the same continued Operation.
But avow to you, that after such solid Pains, I took a singular Pleasure
to read the Antient Quarrel of the <i>Philosophers</i> Stone with <i>Gold</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>; the Neatness, the Simplicity, and the Solidity of this
Tract have charmed me; and as it is standing Truth, that he who understands
one true <i>Philosopher</i> perfectly, does most certainly understand them
all; permit me, if you please, to ask you some Questions concerning this,
and have the Goodness to answer me with the same Sincerity that you have
always used towards me. I assure my self, that after that, I shall be as
much instructed as it is necessary to be put my Hand to the Work, and happily
to arrive at the Possession of the greatest of all those temporal Blessings,
wherewith it pleases God to honour those who Labor in his Love and Fear.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>I am ready to satisfy your Demands, and shall be very glad to hear you
touch the essential Point, whilst I ma in the Resolution to conceal nothing
from you of what may serve for the Instruction you may think you want:
But I believe it will be proper that I first make you some Remarks, that
will very much contribute to clear some important Passages of the Tract
you have mentioned.
<p>Remark then, that the term <i>Stone</i> is taken in many different Acceptations,
and in particular with regard to the three different Station of the Work;
which makes <i>Geber</i> say, That there are three Stones, which are the
three Medicines answering to the three degrees of Perfection of the Work;
so that the Stone of the first Order, is the Matter of the <i>Philosophers</i>
perfectly purified, and reduced into a pure mercurial Substance; the Stone
of the second Order, is the same Matter decocted, digested, and fixed into
an incombustible Sulphur; the Stone of the third Order, is the very same
Matter fermented, multiplied, and pushed to the last Perfection of Tincture
fixt, permanent, and tinging: And these three Stones are the three Medicines
of the three Kinds.
<p>Remark further, that there is a great Difference between the Stone of
the <i>Philosophers</i>, and the <i>Philosophick</i> Stone. The first is
the Subject of <i>Philosophy</i>, considered in the state of its first
Preparation, in which it is truly a Stone, since it is solid, hard, heavy,
brittle, frangible; it is a Body (says <i>Philalethes</i>) <i>because it
flows in Fire like a Metal;</i> and yet it is a Spirit, <i>for it is wholly
Volatile. It is the Compound and the Stone that contains the Humidity,
that runs in the Fire </i>(says <i>Arnoldus</i> in his letter to the King
of <i>Naples</i>) it is in this State that it is a <i>middle Substance
between a Metal and </i>Mercury (as the Abbot <i>Sinesius</i>expresses
it) its is in fine in this State, that <i>Geber</i> considers it, where
he says in two Places of his Summa, <i>Take our stone, that is to say </i>(saith
he,) <i>the Matter of our Stone, </i>just as if he had said, take the <i>Philosopher's</i>
Stone, which is the Matter of the <i>Philosophic</i> Stone.
<p>The <i>Philosophick</i> Stone, is therefore the same Stone of the <i>Philosophers;</i>
when by the secret Magistery it is exalted to the Perfection of the third
Order, transmuting all imperfect Metals into pure <i>Gold</i> or <i>Silver</i>,
according to the Nature of the Ferment adjoined to it. These Distinctions
will do you considerable Service, to unfold the difficult Sense of the
<i>Philosophical</i>
Writings, and to clear up divers Passages of this very Author, upon which
you intended to discourse me.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I already discern the Utility of these Remarks, and find in them the
Explication of some of my Doubts; but before we pass any further, pray
tell me whether the Author of this little Tract, which I speak of, deserves
the Approbation that many learned Men do give it, and whether it contains
the whole Secret of the Work?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You need not doubt, but that this Treatise is done by the Hand of a
true Adept, and consequently merits the Esteem and Approbation of <i>Philosophers</i>.
The principal Design of this Author, is to undeceive an almost infinite
number of Artists, who deceived by the literary sense of our Writings,
obstinately persist , that the Magistery is to be effected by the Conjunction
of <i>Gold</i> with <i>Mercury</i> variously prepared; and to convince
them absolutely, he maintains with the best and most Antient <i>Philosophers</i>
{1} that <i>the Work is not</i> <i>made but of one only Thing, of one only
and the same Species.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>That is the very first of the places that raised me some Scruples; for
methinks one may reasonably doubt, that Perfection ought to be sought in
one only self same Substance, and that without adding any Thing to it,
one can be able to make all Things of it. The <i>Philosophers</i> on the
contrary say, that not only we must remove the Superfluities from the Matter,
but what is wanting must be likewise added to it.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is easy to deliver you from that Doubt by this comparison; in the
same manner as Juices extracted from divers Herbs, depurated from the Faeces,
and incorporated together, make but one Confection of one only and self
same Species; so the <i>Philosophers</i>, with Reason, call their prepared
Matter, one only and self Thing, although we are not ignorant that it is
a natural Compound of certain Substances from one same Root, and of one
same Kind, making together one whole compleat Homogeneity; in this Sense
the <i>Philosophers</i> do all agree, though some say, their Matter is
compounded of two Things, and others of three; though some write, that
is consists of four, and some of five; and others again that it is but
one only Thing: They are all equally in the right, because divers Things
of one and the same Kind naturally and intimately united, even as several
Waters distilled from Herbs, and mingled together, do indeed constitute
but one only self-same Thing; and this is done in our Art, and so much
more fundamentally, as the Substances that make up the philosophical Compound,
differ less among themselves, than sorrel Water differs from lettice Water.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I have nothing to reply to what you have said, I comprehend the Sense
of it very well; but there remains with me a Doubt upon this Occasion,
that I know several Persons well versed in the reading of the best <i>Philosophers</i>,
and who yet follow a Method quite contrary to the first Foundation that
our Author lays; that is to say, that {2} <i>the philosophical Matter hath
no need of any Thing whatsoever, other than to be dissolved and coagulated.</i>
For these Persons begin the work by Coagulation; they must therefore work
upon a liquid Matter, instead of a <i>Stone</i>; pray inform me, whether
this Method be that of Truth?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Your Remark is very judicious, the greatest part of true <i>Philosophers</i>
are of the same Sentiment with this Author. The Matter has no need but
to be dissolved, and then coagulated; Mixtion, Conjunction, Fixation, Coagulation,
and other like Operations, are made almost of themselves; but Solution
is the great Secret of the Art. It is this essential Point that the <i>Philosophers
</i>do
not reveal. All the Operations of the first Work, or the first Medicine,
is nothing (to speak properly) but a continual Solution; so that Calcination,
Extraction, Sublimation, Distillation, is but a true Solution of the Matter.
<i>Geber</i>
taught not the Necessity of Sublimation, but because it not only purifies
the Matter from its gross and combustible Parts; but also, because it disposes
to Solution, from whence results the Mercurial Humidity, which is the Key
of the Work.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I am now well fortified against those pretended <i>Philosophers, </i>who
are of a contrary Sentiment to this Author; and I know not, how they can
imagine that their Opinion squares exactly with the best Authors.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>This very Author alone suffices to let them see their Error, he explains
himself by a very right simile of Ice, which melts with the least Heat;
to let us know, {3} <i>That the principal Operation is to procure the Solution
of a Matter hard and dry, coming near to the Nature of a </i>Stone; which,
nevertheless, by the Action of the natural Fire, ought to be resolved into
a dry Water, as easily as Ice is melted by the least Heat.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I should be extreamly obliged to you, if you would be so kind to inform
me, what it is you call {4} <i>the natural Fire. </i>I very well know it
is the principal Key of the Art, many <i>Philosophers</i> have expressed
the Nature of it by very obscure Parables; but I do confess to you, that
I have not as yet been able to comprehend this Mystery.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is indeed the great Mystery of the Art, all other Mysteries of this
sublime Philosophy depending on the Knowledge of this. How satisfied should
I be, might I nakedly explain this Secret to you; but I cannot do that,
which no <i>Philosopher</i> believes to be in his Power, all you can reasonably
expect of me is to tell you, that the natural Fire whereof this <i>Philosopher</i>
speaks is an potential Fire, that burns not the Hands, but makes its Efficacy
appear, being a little exited by the exterior Fire. It is therefore a Fire
truly Secret, that this Author in the Title of his Work call <i>Lunar Vulcan</i>.
<i>Artephius</i>
has made a more ample Description of it, than any other
<i>Philosopher.Pontanus
</i>has
copied him, and tells us, that he erred two Hundred times, because he knew
not this Fire, 'till the had read an understood
<i>Artephius</i>; this
mysterious Fire is natural, because it is of one same Nature with the philosophick
Matter; but nevertheless, the artist prepares them both.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>What you have told me, rather excites, than satisfies my Curiosity.
Blame not the earnest Request I make you, to instruct me more clearly,
in a Point of such Importance, that without the Knowledge of it, it were
in vain to pretend to the Work; for without it, one meets a full Stop,
after the first Step made in the practick Part of the Work.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>The wise Men have been no less reserved concerning their Fire, than
concerning their Matter; sot that it is not in my Power to add any Thing
to what I have said of it. I remit you therefore to <i>Artephius </i>and
<i>Pontanus</i>.Consider
only with Application, that this natural Fire is an artificial Invention
of the Artist, that it is proper to calcine, dissolve, and sublime the
<i>Stone</i>
of the <i>Philosophers</i>; and that there is but this one sort of Fire
in this World able to produce the like Effect. Consider that this Fire
is of the Nature of Lime or Calx, and that it is in no sort a Stranger,
with regard to the Subject of Philosophy. Consider, in fine, also by what
means <i>Geber</i> teaches to make the Sublimations require to this Art;
for my part I can do no more, but make for you the same with that another
<i>Philosopher</i>
made, <i>That the Stars</i> of Venus<i> and horned </i>Diana<i> may be
propitious to you.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I should have been glad you had spoken more intelligibly, but since
there are certain Bounds, beyond which the <i>Philosophers</i> cannot pass;
I content my self with what you have made be Remark; I will again read
over <i>Artephius</i> with more Application, than I have yet done, and
I shall not forget what you have told me, that the secret Fire of the wise
Men, is a Fire that the Artist prepares according to art; or at least,
that he cause to be prepared by hose what have a perfect Knowledge of Chymistry;
that this Fire is not actually hot, but that it is a fiery Spirit, introduced
into a Subject of one self same Nature with the <i>Stone</i>, and which
being moderately excited by the exterior Fire, calcines, dissolves, sublimes
the <i>Stone, and resolves it into a dry Water, </i>as <i>Cosmopolite</i>
has expressed it.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You perfectly comprehend what I have been telling you; I find so by
the Commentary you add to it. You must know, that from this first Solution,
Calcination, or Sublimation, which are here one and the same Thing, there
results the Separation of the <i>terrestrial and adustible </i>Parts of
the <i>Stone; </i>especially if you follow <i>Geber'</i>s Councel touching
the Regiment of the Fire in the manner he teaches it, where he treats of
the <i>Sublimation of the Bodies, and of Mercury</i>. You ought to hold
if for a constant Truth, that there is but this one way in the World, to
extract from the <i>Stone</i> its unctuous Humidity, which inseparably
contain the <i>Sulphur</i>, and the <i>Mercury</i> of the wise Men.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I am thus intirely satisfied upon the principal Point of the first Work;
do me the Favour to tell of the first Work, if the Comparison that our
Author makes {5} <i>of Wheat, with the </i>Stone<i> of</i> Philosophers,
<i>with
regard to their necessary Preparation,</i> to make Bread with the one,
and the Universal with the other, appears to you to be a proper and well
suited Comparison.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is as proper as can be made, if the <i>Stone</i> be considered in
the State wherein the Artist begins to put it, to be able to be rightly
called the subject and philosophick Compound; for just as we are not nourished
by Wheat; such a Nature produces it; but we are obliged to reduce it into
Meal, to separate from the Bran, to make it into Paste with Water, to make
Bread of it, which must be baked in an Oven to become a proper Aliment;
in the same manner, we take the <i>Stone</i>, we grind, or powder it, we
separate from it by the secret Fire its Terrestreity; we sublime it, we
dissolve it with the Water of the Sea of the wise Men; we decoct this simple
Confection, to make of it a sovereign Medicine.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>Give me leave to tell you, that there seems to me some difference in
this Comparison. The Author says, that one must take this Mineral alone,
to make this great Medicine, and yet with Wheat alone we cannot make Bread;
it is necessary to add to it, not only Water, but Leaven.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You have already the Answer to this Objection; in as much as this <i>Philosopher,
</i>like
all the rest, forbids not <i>absolutely to add any Thing</i>, but that
nothing strange, <i>or contrary be added.</i> The Water that is added to
the Meal, and the Leaven likewise, are nothing strange, or contrary to
the Meal; the Grain of which 'tis made was nourished by Water in the Earth;
and Water is therefore of a Nature analogical to Meal: <i>So the Water
of the Sea of the </i>Philosophers, <i>is of the same Nature with our </i>Stone;
because all that is comprized under the Mineral, and metallick Gendre,
was formed and nourished of that very same Water in the Bowels of the Earth,
whither it penetrates with the Influence of the Stars. You may plainly
see, by what I have said, that the <i>Philosophers</i> do not contradict
themselves, when they say it is one only self Substance, and when they
speak of it as a compound of many Substances of one only, and the self
same Species.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I think there is none but must be convinced by so solid Reasons as those
you alledge. But tell, if you please, whether I am mistaken in the consequence
I draw from that Passage of our Author, where he says, that {6} <i>those
that know after what manner Metals and Minerals ought to be treated, may
go directly to the Work they aim at.</i> If this be so, it is evident that
the Matter and Subject of the Art must not be sought for, but in the Family
of Metals and Minerals, and that all that work upon other Subjects, are
in the Road of Error.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>I will answer, your consequence is very well drawn; this <i>Philosopher</i>
is not alone in speaking thus, he agrees therein with the greatest Number,
Antient and Modern. <i>Geber</i>, who perfectly knew the Magistery, and
who used no Allegory, treats throughout his whole Summa only of Metals
and Minerals, of Bodies and Spirits, and of the right manner of performing
them, to make the Work of them. But as the philosophick Matter is partly
Body, and partly Spirit, as in one Sense it is Terrestrial, and in another
it is all Celestial; and as some Authors consider it in one Sense, and
other treat of it in another, this has given Occasion to the Error of a
great Number of Artists; who under the Name of <i>Universalists</i>, reject
every Matter that hath received a determinative from Nature; because they
cannot destroy the particular Matter, to separate from it the Grain which
is the pure universal Substance, which the particular Matter shuts up in
its Bosom, and to which the wise and illuminated Artist can absolutely
render the Universality necessary to it, by the natural Conjunction that
he makes of this Germ, with the most universal Matter, from whence it hath
drawn the its Original. Be not frightened at these singular Expressions,
our Art is Cabalistick, You will easily comprehend these Mysteries before
you are to the end of the Questions, which you design to make me upon the
Author that you examine.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>If you gave me not this hope, I protest to you, that these mysterious
Obscurities were enough to put me quite off, and make me Despair of my
good Success; but I repose an entire Confidence in what you tell me, and
I very well comprehend, <i>That the Metals of the Vulgar, are not the Metals
of the </i>Philosophers<i>; for it is evident, that to be such they must
be destroyed, and cease to be Metals: </i>And the wise Man wants nothing
but the viscus Humidity, which is their first Matter from which the <i>Philosophers
</i>make
their living Metals by an Artifice, that is a Secret as it is founded upon
Principles of Nature; is not that your meaning?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>If you are as well acquainted with the Laws of the Practice of the Work,
as you seem to me to comprehend the Theory, you have no need of my Instruction.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I beg your pardon, I ma very far from being so great a Proficient; what
you take for an Effect of a perfect Knowledge of the Art, is nothing but
a Facility of Expression that I have got by reading of Authors, with whom
I have filled my Memory. I am on the contrary ready to Despair of ever
attaining to such a Pitch of Knowledge, when I consider, that this <i>Philosopher</i>
requires, as do divers others, that he that aspires to this Science {7}
<i>should
know externally and internally the Properties of all Things, and that he
penetrate into the Depth of the Operations </i>of Nature. Tell me, if you
please, who is the Man that can flatter himself to arrive at a Knowledge
of so vast an Extent?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is true, this <i>Philosophers</i> puts no Bounds to the Learning
of him, who pretends to understand so miraculous an Art; for the wise Man
ought to be perfectly acquainted with Nature in general, and her Operations
as well in the Center of the Earth, in the Generation of Minerals and Metals,
as upon the Earth in the productive of Vegetables and Animals. He ought
also to know the universal Matter, and the Matter particular and immediate,
upon which Nature works for the Generation of all Beings, he ought, in
fine, to know the Affinity and Sympathy, as also the Antipathy and natural
Aversion that is found in all Things of the World. Such was the Science
of the great <i>Hermes</i>, and of the first <i>Philosophers, </i>who like
him arrived at the Knowledge of this sublime Philosophy, by their penetrating
Minds, and by the Strength of their Reasoning; but since this Science was
committed to Writing, and that the general Knowledge of which I gave you
an Idea is to be found in good Books; Reading, Meditation, good Sense,
and a sufficient Practice in Chymistry, may give almost all the necessary
Light to acquire the Knowledge of this supreme Philosophy; add thereto
Uprightness of Heart, and of Intention, without which it is impossible
to succeed.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>You give me a most sensible Joy. I have read much; I have meditated
yet more; I have exercised my self in the Practice of Chymistry; I have
verified the saying of <i>Artephius</i>, who assures, <i>That he knows
not the Composition of Metals, who is ignorant how they must be destroyed,</i>
and without this Destruction it is impossible to extract the metallick
Humidity, which is the true Key of the Art; so that I can assure my self,
that I have acquired the greatest part of the Qualities, that according
to you, are required in him that aspires to this high Understanding: I
have, besides, a very particular Advantage, and that is the Goodness that
you have in being willing to communicate a part of your Knowledge to me
in the clearing of my Doubts; permit me, therefore, to go on, and to ask
you upon what Foundation <i>Gold </i>uses such outrageous Term to the Stone
of the <i>Philosophers, </i>{8} <i>Calling it a venomous Worm, and treating
it with the Appellation of Enemy of Men, and of Metals.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>These Expressions ought not to seem strange to you, the <i>Philosophers
</i>themselves
call their Stone <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Serpent, infecting all Things with
its Venom.</i> Its Substance, and its Vapour, are indeed a Poison, which
the <i>Philosopher </i>should know how to change into an Antidote by Preparation
and Decoction. The Stone is moreover the Enemy of Metals, since it destroys
them, and devours them. <i>Cosmopolite </i>says, there is a Metal, and
a Steel, <i>which is as the Water of Metals, which has the Power to consume
Metals, that there in nothing but the radical Moisture of the Sun, and
of the Moon, that can resist it. </i>But take heed that you do not here
confound the <i>Philosopher's </i>Stone, with the <i>Philosophick </i>Stone;
because, if the first like a true <i>Dragon</i> destroys and devours the
imperfect Metals; yet the second, as a sovereign Medicine, transmutes them
into perfect Metals, and makes the perfect more than perfect, and fit to
make perfect the imperfect.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>What you say not only confirms me in the Knowledge I have acquired by
Reading, Mediation, and Practice; but likewise gives me a new additional
Light, where Splendour dispels that Darkness, under which the most important
philosophick Truths have seemed to me 'till now to be veiled. And I now
conclude from our Author's Words, that those great Physicians are mistaken,
who believe {9} <i>That the universal Medicine is in Gold vulgar.</i> Do
me the Favour to tell me your Opinion in the Point.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>There is no doubt but <i>Gold</i> possesses great Virtues for the Preservation
of Health, and for curing the most dangerous Diseases. Venus, Jupiter,
Saturn and Mars, are every Day usefully employed by Physicians, as likewise
is Luna; because their Solution or Decomposition which manifests their
Properties, is easier than that of Sol; and therefore the more such Preparations
as the vulgar Artist make of it, have an Agreement with the Principles
and Practice of our Art; the more they make appear, the marvellous Virtues
of Sol; but I tell you in Truth, that without the Knowledge of our Magistery
(which only can teach the essential Destruction of Sol) 'tis impossible
to make the universal Medicine of it; but the wise can make it much more
easily with the <i>Gold</i> of <i>Philosophers,
</i>than with Sol vulgar;
and so you see this Author makes the Stone reply to Sol, <i>That it might
rather be angry with God, becausehe had not given it those Advantages wherewith
he had been pleased only to endue the Stone.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>To this fist Injury that {Sun} does to the Stone, it does a second {10}
<i>Calling
it fugitive and cheat, deceiving all those that place any hope in it.</i>
Instruct, pray, how to support the Innocence of the Stone, and justify
it from a Scandal of this Nature.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Call to mind the Remark, that I have already caused you to make, touching
the three different States of the Stone; and you will then know, as well
as my self, that of Necessity it must in its beginning be all Volatile,
and by consequence fugitive, for to be depurated from all manner of Terrestreity,
and brought from Imperfection to the Perfection that the Magistery gives
it in its other States; and therefore the Reproach intended by {Sun}, turns
into its Praise; for were it not Volatile and Fugitive in the beginning,
it would be impossible to give it at last the Perfection and Fixity that
are necessary to it; so that if it deceives any, it is only the ignorant;
but it is always faithful to the Sons of the Science.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>What you tell me is a certain Truth; I have learned from <i>Geber</i>,
that only Spirits, that is to say, <i>Volatile Substances are capable to
penetrate Bodies, to be united to them, to change, tinge, and perfect them;
when these Spirits have been cleared from their gross Parts, and adustible
Humidity.</i> And thus I am fully satisfied upon this Point; but as I perceive
the Stone {11} has a great Contempt for {Sun}, and <i>boasts to contain
in its Bosom a </i>Gold <i>infinitely more precious;</i> do me the favour
to tell me how many sorts of Sol the <i>Philosophers</i> own.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>To leave you nothing do desire concerning the Theory, and the Practice
of our Philosophy; I will acquaint you, that according to the <i>Philosophers</i>,
there are three sorts of Sol.
<p>The first is an Astral Sol, whose Center is the Sun, who by its Rays
communicates it, together with its Light to all the Stars, that are inferior
with its Light to all the Stars, that are inferior to him. It is a fiery
Substance, and a continual Emanation of little solar Bodies, which by the
Motion of the Sun and Stars, being in a perpetual Flux and Reflux, fill
the whole Universe; all Things through the Extent of the Heavens, upon
the Earth, and in its Bowels are therewith penetrated, we breathe continually
this Astral <i>Gold</i>, these solar Particle incessantly penetrate into,
and exhale from our Bodies.
<p>The second is an Elementary Sol, that is to say, it is the most pure
and the most fixt Portion of the Elements, and of all the Substances that
are composed of them; so that all the sublunary Beings of the three Genders,
contain in their Center a precious Grain of this elementary <i>Gold.</i>
<p>The third is the beautiful Metal, whose unalterable Splendour and Perfection
give it a Value, that makes it esteemed by all Men as a sovereign Remedy
of all the Ills, and all the Necessities of Life, and as the only Foundation
of humane Power and Grandeur; and therefore it is no less the object of
the Avarice of the greatest Princes, than it is the with and desire of
all manner of People.
<p>After this you will easily conclude, that the metallick <i>Gold</i>
is not the <i>Gold </i>of the <i>Philosophers</i>, and that it is not without
a good Foundation, that in this Controversy before us, the Stone reproaches
Sol with not being what it presumes to be, but that it is the Stone which
hides in its Bosom the true Sol of the wise Men, that is to say, the two
first Sorts of Sol, that I just now named to you; for you must know, that
the Stone being the most pure Portion of the metallick Elements, after
the Separation and Purification, which the wise Man has made of it; it
follows, that it is properly the <i>Gold</i> of the second sort; but when
this Sol perfectly calcined and exalted unto the Cleanness, and to the
Whiteness of Snow, has acquired by the Magistery a natural Sympathy with
the Astral <i>Gold</i>, of which it is visibly become the true Magnet,
it attracts and concenters in it self so great a Quantity of Astral <i>Gold</i>,
and of solar Particles, which it receives from the continual Emanation
that is made of them from the Center of the <i>Sun</i>, and of the <i>Moon</i>,
that it is found in the nearest Disposition to be the living <i>Gold</i>
of the <i>Philosophers</i>, infinitely more noble, and more precious than
the metallick Sol, which is a Body without Soul, and cannot be vivyfied,
but by our living <i>Gold,</i> and by the Means of our Magistery.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>How many Clouds do you dissipate in my Mind, and how many philosophical
Mysteries do you unfold to me at a time, by the admirable Things you tell
me! I shall never be able to give you all the Thanks I owe you. I confess,
I am no longer surprised, that the Stone pretends to the preference before
{Sun}, nor that it dispises its Brightness, and its imaginary Merit; since
the smallest Part of what the Stone gives to the <i>Philosophers</i>, is
of more value than all the <i>Gold</i> in the World. Be pleased to have
the Goodness to continue your favour towards me, as you have begun, and
do me the Kindness to tell me, how the Stone can ascribe to it self as
an honour {12} <i>to be a matter fluid, and not permanent</i>; since all
the <i>Philosophers</i> affirm it to be more fixt then {Sun} itself.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You see, that your Author assures, that the Fluidity of the Stone turn
to the Advantage of the Artist; but he adds, that it is necessary at the
same Time, that the Artist know how to extract this Fluidity, and which
is the only Thing whereof the <i>Philosophers</i> has need, as I have told
you already; so that to be fluid, volatile, and not permanent, are qualities
as necessary to the Stone in its <i>first </i>State, as are its fixity
and permanency when it is in the State of its utmost Perfection; it is
therefore with reason that the Stone esteems that quality as an honour,
and so much the rather as the Fluidity does not hinder, but that the Stone
is notwithstanding endued with a Soul more fixt than <i>Gold</i>: But I
tell you once more, that the great Secret consists in knowing how to extract
the Humidity of the Stone. I have appraised you, that this is indeed the
most important Key of the Art. And upon this very Point it is, that the
great <i>Hermes</i> cries out, <i>Blessed be the watry Form which dissolves
the Elements.</i> Happy then is the Artist who not only knows the Stone,
but also can turn it into Water. Which cannot be done by any other means,
than by our <i>secret Fire</i>, which calcines, dissolves, and sublimes
the Stone.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>Whence comes it then, {13} <i>That among a hundred Artists, there is
scarce one to be found that works with the Stone</i>; and that instead
of sticking to this one and only matter (alone able to produce so great
Marvels) they do on the contrary, almost all of them, apply themselves
to Subjects that have none of the essential Qualities, that the <i>Philosophers
</i>attribute
to their Stone.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>That happens in the first Place, through the Ignorance of Artists, who
have not so much Knowledge as they ought to have of Nature, nor of what
she is able to operate in every Thing; and in the second Place, it happens,
thro'o a want of Penetration of Mind, which Occasions that they are easily
deceived by the equivocal Expressions, that the <i>Philosophers </i>make
Use of, to hide from the Ignorant, both the Matter, and its true Preparation.
These two great Defects are the cause of the Mistake of these Artists,
and that they fix upon Subjects wherein they discern some of the exterior
Qualities of the true Matter of the <i>Philosophers</i>, without making
Reflection on the essential Character, that manifest it to the Wise?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I see plainly the Error of those who imagine, the vulgar {Sun} and {Mercury}
are the true Matter of <i>Philosophers; </i>and I ma fully persuaded of
it. seeing upon how weak a Foundation {Sun} builds the pretence of its
Advantage over the Stone, alledging for that purpose these word of {14}
<i>Hermes;
The Sun is its Father, and the Moon is its Mother.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>This Foundation if frivolous; I have told you what the <i>Philosophers</i>
mean when they attribute to the Sun and Moon the Principles of the Stone.
The Sun and Stars are indeed the first Cause of it; they inspire the Stone
with that Spirit and Soul that give it Life, and make all its Efficacy.
And therefore it is that they are its Father and Mother.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>All the <i>Philosophers</i> say as this, {15} <i>That the Physical Tincture
is composed of a red and incombustible </i>Sulphur, <i>and of a clear and
well purified {Mercury}; </i>is this Authority any stronger than the last,
to make it to be concluded, that <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i> are the
Matter of the Stone?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You ought not to have forgotten, that all the <i>Philosophers </i>unanimously
declare that vulgar Gold and Metals are not their Metals; that theirs are
living, and that the others are dead; nor should you have forgotten that
I showed you by the Authority of the <i>Philosophers</i>, supported upon
the Principles of Nature, that the metallick Humidity of the Stone prepared
and purify'd, contains inseparably in its Bosom the <i>Sulphur</i>, and
the Mercury of the <i>Philosophers; </i>that it is by consequence that
only thing of one only and self same kind, to which nothing ought to be
added; and that the only Mercury of the wise Men contains its own
<i>Sulphur</i>,
my means whereof it coagulates, and fixes it self; you ought therefore
to hold for an undoubted Truth, that the artificial Mixture of a <i>Sulphur</i>,
and of a {Mercury}, whatever they be otherways than those which are naturally
in the Stone, will never be the true philosophick Confection.
<center>

<p>But {16} <i>that great and natural Friendship which is between Gold
and {Mercury}, and the Union of them so easily made; </i>are they not Proofs
that these two Substances may be converted by a due Digestion into a Tincture?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>There is nothing more absurd then that, for if all the Mercury mingled
with Sol, should be converted into Sol, which is impossible, or that all
the Sol should be turned into Mercury, or into some middle Substance, there
would never by found more of solar Tincture in the Confection, than there
was in the <i>Gold</i>, thus mingled with the Mercury; and by consequence
it would have not tinging Virtue, nor multiplying Power. But it is most
certain, that there never can be any perfect Union of {Sun} and {Mercury};
for this fugitive Companion will abandon the {Sun}, as soon as ever it
is pressed by the Action of the Fire.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I doubt not in any sort of what you have now told me, those Sentiments
being confirmed by the Experience of the most solid <i>Philosophers</i>,
who openly declare themselves against <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i> vulgar;
but at the same Time I have a doubt, which is this, that it being true,
that the <i>Philosophers</i> never speak the Truth less, than when they
seem openly to explain themselves, may they not, as touching the evident
Exclusion of Sol, deceive those who take the Sense of their Expressions
according to the Letter? Or may one rely upon for a Certainty, as this
Author says {17} <i>That the</i> Philosophers <i>do not manifest their
Art, but when they make use of Similitudes, of Figures, and of Parables?</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>There is a great deal of difference between declaring positively, that
such or such a matter it not the true Subject of the Art, as they do, touching
Sol and Mercury; and giving to understand under Figures and Allegories,
the most important Secrets to the Children of the Science, that have the
Advantage clearly to discern the philosophick Truths, thro' the enigmetical
Vails wherewith the Sages so artfully cover and conceal them. In the first
Case, the <i>Philosophers</i> speak the Truth negatively, without any double
meaning; but when the speak both affirmatively and clearly upon this Subject,
it may be concluded, that those who stick to the literal Sense of their
Words, will undoubtedly be deceived. The <i>Philosophers</i> have no way
more certain to hide their Science from the unworthy, and open it to the
wise, then not to explain it by Allegories in the essential Points of their
Art; it was this made <i>Artephius say, That this Art is intirely Cabalistical,
</i>for
the understanding whereof, there is need of a kind of Revelation; the most
penetrating Wit, (without the Assistance of a faithful Friend, who is a
Master,) not being sufficient to distinguish Truth from Falsehood, it being
next to impossible, that by the only help of Books, and of Labour, and
Experiments, one should be able to arrive at the Knowledge of the Matter,
and much less to acquire understanding of the Practice of an Art so singular,
how plain, how natural, and how easy soever the same may be.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I know by my own Experience, how needful is the help of a true Friend,
such as you are. In the want of which, methinks, such Artists that have
Wit, good sense and Probity, have no better way than to confer together
often, sometimes upon what Light they draw from the reading of good Books,
and sometimes upon the Discoveries their Experiments afford them; that
so from the Diversity and comparing of their different Sentiments, there
may spring new Sparks of Knowledge, by which they may be enabled to carry
their Discoveries to the last Period of this secret Science. I doubt not
but you approve of my Opinion; but as I know that several Artists regard
as visionary and paradoxical the Sentiments of those Authors, who maintain
with this, {18} <i>That Perfection is to be sought in Things imperfect;</i>
I shall be extremely obliged to you, if you please to give me your Sense
upon a Point that seems to me to be of great consequence.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You are already persuaded of the Sincerity and Truth of your Author;
and you ought so much the less to call it in Question upon this Point,
in that he is of one Mind herein with the true <i>Philosophers;</i> and
I cannot better prove to you the Truth of what he says here, than by making
use of the same Reason, that he (quoting the Learned <i>Raymond Lully</i>)
has given of it. For it is certain, that Nature stops in her Productions,
when she has brought them to their proper State and Perfection; for Example,
when from a most clear and most pure mineral Water tinged by some Portion
of metallick <i>Sulphur</i>, Nature produces a precious Stone, she stops
there, as she likewise does when in the Bowels of the Earth she hath formed
{Sun} with mercurial Water, Mother of all Metals, impregnated with a pure
solar <i>Sulphur</i>; so that it is not possible to make a Diamond, or
a Ruby more precious, than it is in its kind; so neither is it in the Power
of the Artist, nay (I will go further,) nor of Nature her self, so push
on <i>Gold</i> to a greater Perfection, than what she has given it. It
is the <i>Philosopher</i> that can only carry Nature from an undetermined
Imperfection, even to a State more than Perfect. It is therefore necessary,
that our Magistery produce a <i>plusquam</i> Perfection, which to accomplish,
the Sage must begin with a Thing imperfect, which being in the way of Perfection,
is found in the natural Disposition to be carried on even to <i>plusquam</i>
Perfection, by the help of an Art wholly Divine, which is able to exceed
the limited Bounds of Nature; and indeed if our Art could not exalt a Subject
to a State of <i>plusquam</i> Perfection, neither could we give Perfection
to what is imperfect, and all our Philosophy were vain.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>There is none but must needs yield to the Solidity of your Reasoning;
but would not one be apt to think, that this Author plainly contradicts
himself there, where he makes the Stone say, that common {Mercury} (how
well soever it may be purged,) is not the [Mercury] of the wise Men; and
that for this only Reason, {19} <i>Because it is imperfect</i>; when according
to him, if it were perfect, the intended Perfection were not to be sought
in it.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Take good Notice of this, and observe, that if the [Mercury] of the
wise Men hath been elevated by Art from an imperfect, to a perfect State,
yet this Perfection is not of the Nature of that, whereat Nature stops
in the Production of Things, according to the Perfection of their kind,
such as is that of [Mercury] vulgar; but on the contrary, the Perfection
which the Art gives to the [Mercury] of the wise Men, is but a middle State,
a Disposition, and a Power that makes it fit to be carried by the continuance
of the Work, unto the state of <i>plusquam </i>Perfection, which gives
it the Faculty by the Accomplishment of the Magistery, at last to give
Perfection to the imperfect.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>These Reasons, how abstract soever, are very plain, and make Impression
on the Mind; for my part, I confess, they fully convince me; I beseech
you, to have the Goodness not to be offended at the Continuation of my
Inquiries. Our Author assures us, that the Error into which the Artists
fall, in taking vulgar <i>Sol</i> and <i>Mercury</i> for the true Matter
of the Stone, deceived therein by the literal Sense of the <i>Philosophers,
</i>{20}<i>
Is the great stumbling Block to Thousands of Persons; </i>for my part I
can't imagine, how with any Reading, and good Sense, it is possible to
harbour an Opinion so visibly condemned by the best <i>Philosophers?</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>And yet the Thing is so. The <i>Philosophers </i>warn them to no purpose,
to take heed not to be deceived by common <i>Sol </i>and <i>Mercury</i>.
Most do, nevertheless, obstinately adhere to them, and very often after
having wrought in vain trough a long Course of Years upon Matters strange
and foreign, and are sensible of their fault, they then come to vulgar
<i>Sol</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>, wherein they find their Account no better then before.
It is true, there are some <i>Philosophers,</i> who though otherwise appearing
very sincere, yet throw Artists into this Error, maintaining very seriously,
that those that know not the <i>Gold </i>of the <i>Philosophers</i>, may
nevertheless find it in common <i>Gold </i>decocted with the <i>Mercury</i>
of the <i>Philosophers. Philaletha </i>is of this Sentiment; he assures,
that Count <i>Trevisan</i>, <i>Zachary, </i>and <i>Flamel</i> followed
this Way, but he adds <i>That it is not the true Way of the wise Men, though
it leads to the same End.</i> But these Assurances, however sincere they
may seem, fail not to deceive the Artists, who, desirous to follow the
same <i>Philaletha</i> in the Purification and Animation, that he teaches
of common Mercury, to make the <i>Philosopher's Mercury</i> of it (which
is a most gross Error, under which he hath hidden the Secret of the <i>Mercury</i>
of the wise Men,) undertake upon this Word a most painful and almost impossible
Work; and after a long Labour full of Cares and Dangers, they get nothing
but a <i>Mercury</i>, a little more impure than is was at first, instead
of a <i>Mercury</i> animated with the celestial <i>Quintessence, </i>a
deplorable Error that hath lost an ruin'd, and will still Ruin a very great
Number of Artists.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>It is a great Advantage to become Wise at another's cost; for my part
I will endeavour to reap Profit from this Error by following the good Authors,
and guide my self by the Instruction your Goodness is pleased to give me.
One of the Things that most contributes to the blinding of Artists, who
adhere to {Sun} and {Mercury}, is that usual Expression of <i>Philosophers</i>,
i.e. that their Stone is composed of Male and Female, that Sol supplies
the of place of Male, and Mercury of Female; I know very well, (as my Author
here says,) {21} <i>That it is not after the same manner with Metals, as
with Things that have Life; </i>but yet I shall be very sensibly obliged
to you, if you will please to explain to me wherein this difference consists.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is a constant Truth, that the Copulation of the Male, and of the
Female is ordained by Nature, for the Generation of Animals; but this Union
of the Male and Female for the Production of the Elixir, as likewise for
the Production of Metals, is purely Allegorical, and is no more necessary
than for the Production of Vegetables, whose Seed contains in it self all
that is required for Germination, Increase, and Multiplication of Plants.
You will then Remark, that the philosophical Matter or Mercury of <i>Philosophers
</i>is
a true Seed, which, tho' Homogeneous in its Substance, is yet of a double
Nature, <i>viz.</i> it participates equally of the Nature of metallick
<i>Sulphur</i>
and Mercury; intimately and inseparably united, whereof the one represents
the Male, and the other the Female; for which cause the <i>Philosophers</i>
call it <i>Hermaphrodite</i>, (<i>i.e.</i>) that is endured with both Sexes;
so that without having need of the Mixture of any other thing, it alone
suffices to produce the philosophick Infant, whose Family may be infinitely
multiplied in the same manner, as Gain of Wheat with time and culture may
produce a sufficient Quantity to sow a vast Field.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>If the Wonders are as real as they are probable, one must confess, that
the Science which gives the Knowledge of them, and teaches the Practice,
is almost Supernatural and Divine; but not to digress from my Author, pray
tell me, whether the Stone be not very bold to maintain confidently, and
without shewing very pertinent Reasons {22} <i>That without it, no true
{Sun} and {Moon} can possibly be made.</i> Gold disputes that quality with
him, and sustains himself by an Argument, that carries much Probability;
he lays before the Stone its great Imperfections, as being a gross, impure,
and venomous Matter; and that <i>Gold</i> on the contrary is a Substance
pure, and without Fault; so that, methinks, this high Pretension of the
Stone (opposed by Reasons that appear not to be without Foundation) deserves
to be supported and proved by Reasons of Weight.
<center>
<p><b>EUDOXUS</b></center>

<p>What I have already said, is more than sufficient, to establish to the
Stone a Pre-eminence not only over Gold, but over all created Things; if
you consider attentively, you will see that the Force of Truth is so great,
that {Sun} in attempting to decry the Stone by the Defects it has in its
Birth, tough not intending it, yet does indeed establish its Superiority,
by the most solid Reasons that the Stone it self could allege in its own
Favour, for instance, <i>Gold</i> confesses and acknowledges, that the
Stone sounds its right Pre-eminence, upon this, {23} <i>That it is a mineral
Thing.</i> Needs there any more for the Condemnation of {Sun}, and to oblige
it to give place to the Stone? You are not ignorant how far universal Matter
excels particular Matter. You have been showed that the Stone is the most
pure Part of the metallick Elements, and that by consequence it is the
first Matter of the mineral and metallick Gender, and that when this very
same Matter has been animated, and made Fruitful by the natural Union that
is made of it with the Matter purely universal, it becomes the vegetable
Stone, alone capable to produce the great Effects that the <i>Philosophers</i>
attribute to the three Medicines of the three Kinds. There is o need of
any stronger Reasons to defeat, once for all {Sun} and {Mercury} vulgar,
from their imaginary Pretensions; {Sun} and {Mercury}, and all other particular
Substances, wherein Nature finishes her Operations, whether they be perfect,
or whether they by absolutely imperfect, are intirely unprofitable, or
contrary to our Art.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I ma wholly convinced of it; but, I know several Persons, who ridicule
the Stone, for pretending to dispute Antiquity with {Sun}. Our Author here
maintains the same Paradox, and reproves {Sun} with want of respect to
the Stone, in giving the Lie {24} <i>to one that is older than it self.</i>
Yet as the Stone derives its original from the Metals, it appears difficult
to me to comprehend the Foundation of its Ancients.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>There is no difficulty in giving you Satisfaction as to this Point:
Nay, I do wonder how you came to form such a doubt; the Stone is the first
Matter of the Metals, and consequently it is Prior to {Sun}, and to all
other Metals; and if it derives its Original from them, or if it takes
Birth from their Destruction, it does no therefore follow, that it is a
Production posterior to Metals; but on the contrary, it is Prior to them,
since it is the Matter from whence all Metals have been formed. The Secret
of the Art consists in knowing how to extract from Metals this first Matter,
or this metallick Germ, which is to vegetate, by the Fecundity of the Philosophic
Sea.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I am now convinced of this Truth, and I find {Sun} to be inexcusable,
to be thus wanting in respect to this Elder, who has in its behalf the
most Ancient, and the greatest <i>Philosophers. Hermes, Plato, </i>and
<i>Aristotle</i>
are in its Interest. And every Body knows them to be unquestionable Judges
in this Case. Permit me only to ask you a Question upon each of the Passages
of those <i>Philosophers,</i> whom the Stone has here cited to prove by
their Authority, that it is the only and true Matter of the wise Men.
<p>The Passage of the smaragdine Table of the great <i>Hermes</i>, proves
the excellency of the Stone, in that it shows that the Stone is endued
with two Natures, <i>i.e.</i>, with the Nature of superior Beings, and
with that of inferior Beings; and that these two Natures both alike have
one only and the same Original; so that we must conclude, that they (being
perfectly united in the Stone) compose a third Being of an inexpressible
Virtue: But I know not whether you will be of my Sentiments, as to the
Translation of this Passage, and the Commentary; <i>That which is below,
is as that which is on high; and that which in on high, is as that which
is below.</i> One reads {25} (I say,) <i>To do the miracles of one only
Thing.</i> Form my part, I take it, that the <i>Latin</i> Original has
quite another Sense, for the <i>quibus</i>, which makes the Connexion of
the last Words, with the preceding, signifies, <i>That by These things
</i>(that
is to say, by the Union of these two Natures) <i>one does the Miracles
of one Thing.</i> The <i>to</i>, of which the Translator and Commentator
do make Use, destroys the Sense and the Reason of a Passage that of it
self is very proper and intelligible. Tell me, if you please, whether my
Remark be well founded.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Your Remark is not only right, but it is also important. I confess,
I had made no Reflection upon it; in this you spoil the Proverb, <i>For
here the Scholar outdoes the Master. </i>But as I had read the Emerald
Table oftner in <i>Latin</i> than in <i>French</i>, the fault of the Translation,
and of the Commentary, had raised no sort of doubt in me, as it may do
in those who read only in <i>French</i> this summary of the sublime Philosophy
of <i>Hermes</i>. Indeed the superior and inferior Natures are not alike
to work Miracles, but it is because they are alike, that one can do by
them the Miracles of one only Thing. You may see now that I am altogether
of you Sentiment in this.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I ma then mightily well pleased with my Remark; I doubted whether it
might deserve your Approbation; but I assure my self alter that, that the
Children of the Science will also thank me to have drawn from you upon
this Subject an Explication that will questionless satisfy the Disciples
of the great <i>Hermes.</i> There is no doubt but that the Learned <i>Aristotle</i>
perfectly understood this great Art. What he has written of it, is an evident
Proof he did so; and in this dispute the Stone has the skill to make use
of the Authority of the great <i>Philosopher</i>, by a Passage that contains
its most singular, and most surprising Qualities. Have the Goodness, if
you please, to tell me, how you understand this: {26} <i>It weds it self,
it is with Child by it self, and it is Born of it self.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p><i>The stone weds is self; </i>in as much as in its first Generation,
it is Nature alone assisted by Art, that makes the perfect Unison of the
two Substances, which give it Being, from which Union there results at
the same time the essential Depuration of the Metallick <i>Sulphur</i>and
<i>Mercury.
</i>An
union and Marriage so natural, that the Artist who lends hid Hands to it
in disposing all things requisite, can give no Demonstration of it by the
Rules of Art; since he cannot even so much as well comprehend the Mystery
of this Union.
<p><i>The Stone is with Child by it self; </i>when Art continuing to assist
Nature, by mere natural Means, puts the Stone in the Disposition requisite
for it, to impregnate it self with the Astral Seed, which renders it fruitful,
and gives it the Power of multiplying its kind.
<p><i>The stone is Born of it self; </i>because after having wedded it
self, and after being with Child by it self, Art doing nothing else than
to assist Nature, by the continuance of a Heat necessary to Generation,
it takes a new Birth form it self, just as the <i>Phoenix</i> is born again
from its Ashes; it becomes the Son of the Sun, the universal Medicine of
all Things, that have Life, and the true Living Gold of the <i>Philosophers</i>;
which by the continuance of the Help of the Art, and the Ministry of the
Artist, acquires in a little time the Royal Diadem, and the sovereign Power
over all his Brethren.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I very well conceive, that upon the same Principles, it is not difficult
to comprehend all the other Qualities, that <i>Aristotle </i>attributes
to the <i>Stone</i>, <i>As to kill it self, to reassume Life of it self,
to be dissolv'd of it self in its own Blood, to coagulate it self therewith
a-new</i>; an in fine to acquire all the Properties of the philosophick
Stone. Nor do I now find any difficulty in the Passage of <i>Plato</i>.
I intreat you, nevertheless, that you will please to tell me, what that
Ancient <i>Philosopher</i> and his Followers meant by this {27} <i>That
the stone has a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit, and that all Things are of
it, by it, and in it.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>According to natural Order, <i>Plato</i> ought to have preceded <i>Aristotle</i>,
who was his Scholar, and from whom probably he learnt the secret Philosophy,
wherein he was very desirous that <i>Alexander the Great</i> should believe
him perfectly instructed; if one may be allowed to judge of it by certain
Passages in the Writings of this <i>Philosopher</i>, but however, such
order is of no mighty Importance, if therefore you well examine the Passage
of <i>Plato</i>, and that of <i>Aristotle</i>, you will not find them much
different in Sense: But yet to give you the Satisfaction of an Answer to
the Question you ask me, I will only tell you, that the <i>Stone</i> has
a Body, in as much as it is, as I have told you before, a Substance wholly
metallick, which gives it the Ponderosity; that it hath a Soul, which is
the most pure Substance of the Elements, in which consists its Fixity,
and its Permanency; that it hath a Spirit, which makes the Union of the
Soul with the Body, which [Soul] it acquires particularly from the Influence
of the Stars, and is the Vehicle of Tinctures. Nor will you find it very
hard to conceive, <i>That all Things are of it, by it, and in it</i>; since
you have already seen, that the <i>Stone</i> is not only the first Matter
of all Beings contained in the mineral and metallick Family, but that it
is also united to the universal Matter, from whence all Things have taken
Birth; and this is the Foundation of those last Attributes that <i>Plato</i>gives
to the <i>Stone.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>As I perceive that the <i>Stone</i> not only attributes to it self the
universal Properties, but that it pretends also {28} <i>That the Success
that some Artists have had on certain particular Processes, is only owning
to it</i>; I must confess, that I do not well understand how that can be.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>And yet this <i>Philosopher</i> explains it pretty clearly; he says,
that some Artists who have imperfectly known the <i>Stone</i>, and also
known but a part of the Work, having yet wrought with the <i>Stone</i>,
and found means to separate its Spirit, which contains its Tincture, they
have succeeded so far as to communicate some Part of it to imperfect Metals,
which have Affinity with the <i>Stone</i>, but not having a full Understanding
of its Virtues, nor of the manner of working with it, their Labour has
not turned to any great Account; and even of these Artists the Number is
very small.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>It is natural to conclude from what you have told me, that there are
Persons who have the <i>Stone</i> in their Hands, without knowing all its
Virtues; or if they knew them, yet they are ignorant how to work with it
to succeed in perfecting the great Work, and that this Ignorance is the
Cause that their Labours are not crowned with Success. Pray tell me, if
it be not thus.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Without doubt many Artists have the <i>Stone</i> in their Possession;
some despise it as a mean Thing, others admire it, because of the Characters,
in some sort supernatural, which it carries in its Birth, and yet without
knowing its Value. There are, in fine, who are not ignorant of its being
the true Subject of Philosophy; but the Operations which the sons of Art
are to make upon this noble Subject, are intirely unknown to them; because
they are not taught in Books, and because all <i>Philosophers</i> hide
this admirable Art which converts the <i>Stone</i> into the <i>Mercury</i>
of <i>Philosophers</i>, and which teaches to make the philosophick <i>Stone</i>
into the <i>Mercury</i> of <i>Philosophers</i>, and which teaches to make
the philosophick <i>Stone</i> of this <i>Mercury.</i> This fist Work is
the Secret one, touching which the Sages declare themselves only in Allegories,
and by impenetrable <i>Enigma's</i>, or else are wholly silent in it. And
this as I have told you, is the great Block at which almost all Artists
stumble.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>Happy those that are Masters of so great Knowledge! For my part, I can't
flatter my self to be arrived at so high a Point; but I find my self at
a Loss to know how to thank you enough, for having given me all the Instructions
that I could reasonably desire of you, upon the most essential Points of
this Philosophy, and indeed upon all those Points, touching which you have
been pleased to return Answers to my Questions; I earnestly intreat you
not to grow weary, for I have still something to ask you, which seems to
me to be of very great consequence. This <i>Philosopher</i> assures, that
the Error of those who have wrought with the <i>Stone</i>, and have not
succeeded, proceeds {29} <i>from their not having known the Original, from
whence the Tinctures come</i>. If the source of this philosophical Fountain
be so secret, and so difficult to discover; it is certain, that there are
very many deceived; for it is generally believed, that Metals and Minerals,
and particularly <i>Gold</i>, contain in their Center this Tincture, which
is capable to transmute the imperfect Metals.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>This source of vivifying Water, <i>Is before the Eyes of all the World,</i>
says <i>Cosmopolite, and few Men know it.</i> Gold, Silver, Metals, and
Minerals, contain not a Tincture able to multiply to Infinity, there are
none but the living Metals of the <i>Philosophers</i> that have obtained
from Art and Nature this multiplying Faculty: And it is certain, that there
are none but those who are perfectly enlightened in the philosophick Mystery,
that know the true Original of the Tinctures. You are not of the Number
of those, who are ignorant whence the <i>Philosophers </i>draw their Treasures,
without fear of draining the Source. I have told you clearly, and without
Ambiguity, that the Heaven, and the Stars, but particularly the <i>Sun
</i>and
<i>Moon</i>
are the Principles of this Fountain of living Water, which is alone proper
to operate all the Wonders that you know. It is this that makes <i>Cosmopolite</i>
say in his <i>Enigma</i>, that the delicious Isle, of which he gives the
Description, there was no Water, and that all the Water that was attempted
to be brought thither by Engines, and by Art,
<i>Was either useless or
poisoned, except that which some few Persons knew how to extract from the
Rays of the Sun, or of the Moon. </i>The Means to make this Water to descend
from Heaven is truly wonderful; it is in the Stone, which contains the
central Water, which is indeed one sole and the same Thing with the celestial
Water, but the secret consists in the knowing how to make the Stone become
Magnet, to attract, embrace, and unite this Astral <i>Quintessence </i>to
it self, so as to make together one sole Essence, perfect and more than
perfect, able to give Perfection to the imperfect, after the Accomplishment
of the Magistery.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>How many and great are Obligations to you, that you are pleased to reveal
to me so great Mysteries, to whose Knowledge I could never hope to attain,
without the Assistance of your Elucidations! But since you are pleased
to indulge my continuance, permit me, if you please, to tell you, that
I never saw any <i>Philosopher</i> until now, who so precisely declares
as this does, that there must be a Wife given to the Stone, making it to
that end speak in this manner. {30}. <i>If these artists had carried their
Enquiry further, and had examined which is the Wife who is proper for me;
if they had sought her out, and had united me to her, I had been able to
have tinged a thousand times more. </i>Although I am sensible in general,
that this Passage has an entire Relation to the former, yet, I must confess,
that this Expression of a Wise, proper for the Stone, does notwithstanding
perplex me.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is very much, however, that you know already of your self, that this
Passage has a Connexion with that which I just before explained to you,
<i>i.e.</i>
that you well apprehend, that the Wife which is proper for the Stone, and
which ought to be united to it, is that Fountain of living Water, whose
Source altogether Celestial, which hath particularly its Center in the
Sun, and in the Moon, produces that clear and precious Stream or Rivulet
of the wise Men, which gently slides into the Sea of the <i>Philosophers</i>,
which environs all the World; it is not without very good Reason, that
this Divine Fountain is called by the Author, the Wife of the Stone; some
have represented it under the Form of a heavenly nymph; some give it the
Name of the chaste <i>Diana</i>, whose Purity and Virginity is not defiled
by the spiritual Band that unites it to the Stone: In a word, this magnetick
Connexion is the magical marriage of Heaven and Earth, whereof some <i>Philosophers</i>
have spoken; so that the fruitful Source of the physical Tincture, that
performs so great Wonders, takes Birth from this altogether mysterious
conjugal Union.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I find with an unspeakable Satisfaction the whole Effect of the Elucidations,
you have been pleased to impart to me; and since we are upon this Point,
I desire you leave to ask you a Question, which though it rise not from
the Text of this Author, is yet essential to this Subject. I beseech you
to tell me, whether the magical Marriage of Heaven and Earth can be celebrated
at any time? Or whether there be Seasons of the Year more proper than others
to solemnize those magical Nuptials.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>I am already gone too far, to refuse you an Explication so necessary,
and so reasonable. Divers <i>Philosophers</i> have told the Season of the
Year, which is the most proper for this Operation. Some have made no Mystery
of it; others more reserved have not explained themselves upon this Point,
but in Parables. The first have named the Month of <i>March</i>, and the
<i>Spring</i>.
<i>Zachary</i>,
and other <i>Philosophers</i> say, that they begun the Work at <i>Easter</i>,
and that they finished it happily within the Course of the Year. Others
are contended with representing the Garden of <i>Hesperides</i> enamelled
with Flowers, and particularly with
<i>Violets</i> and <i>Primroses</i>,
which are the earliest Productions of the Spring. <i>Cosmopolite</i> more
ingenious than the rest to indicate, that the Season the most proper for
the philosophick Work, is that wherein all living Beings, sensitives and
vegetables, appear animated with a new Fire, which carries them reciprocally
to Love, and to the Multiplication of their Kinds; he says, that <i>Venus
is the Goddess of this charming Isle,</i> wherein he saw naked all the
Mysteries of Nature; but to denote more precisely this Season, he says,
<i>That
there were seen seeding in the Pasture, Rams and Bulls, with two young
Shepherds, </i>expressing clearly in this witty Allegory, the three spring
Months, by the three celestial Signs, answering to them, <i>viz. Aries,
Taurus </i>and <i>Gemini</i>.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I am ravished with the Interpretations. Those who are greater Proficients
in these Mysteries than I am, perhaps may not put so great a Value as I
do on the Solution of the <i>Enigma</i>'s, whose Sense has notwithstanding
been hitherto impenetrable to many of those, who in other Respects are
supposed to have very well understood the <i>Philosophers.</i> I am persuaded
that one ought very much esteem such an Instruction, it being capable to
make one see clear into other more important Obscurities; indeed few would
imagine, that the <i>Violets</i> and <i>Hyacinths </i>of <i>Espagnet</i>,
and the horned Beast of the Garden of <i>Hesperides</i>; and the House
of the <i>Ram</i> of <i>Cosmopolite</i>, and <i>Philalethe</i>; the Isle
of the Goddess <i>Venus</i>, the two Shepherds, and the rest that you but
now explained, should signify the Season of the Spring. I am not the only
Person who ought to give you a thousand Thanks, that you have been pleased
to unfold these Mysteries; I am assured, that in Process of Time, there
will be found a greater Number of the Sons of Science, who will bless your
Memory for having opened their Eyes upon a Point more essential to this
grand Art, than they would otherwise have been inclined to imagine.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You have Reason in that, one cannot be assured that one understands
the <i>Philosophers</i>, without having an entire understanding of the
least Things that they have written. The Knowledge of the Season proper
to begin the Work, is of no little consequence; the fundamental Reason
thereof is this. Whereas, the Sage undertakes to perform by our Art, a
Thing which is above the ordinary Force of Nature, as to soften a <i>Stone</i>,
and to cause a metallick Germ to vegetate; he finds himself indispensably
obliged to enter by a profound Mediation into the most secret Recesses
of Nature, and to make use of plain, but efficacious Means that she furnishes
him withall, now you ought not to be ignorant, that Nature from the beginning
of the Spring, to renew is self, and to put all the Seeds that are in the
Bosom of the Earth into the Motion proper to Vegetation, impregnates all
the Air that environs the Earth, with a moveable and fermentatious Spirit,
which derives its Original form the Father of Nature; it is properly a
subtile Nitre which gives the fertility of the Earth, whereof it is the
Soul, and which <i>Cosmopolite</i> calls <i>the Salt-Petre of the Philosophers.</i>
It is therefore in this prolifick Season, that the wise Artist, to make
his metallick Seed to bud, cultivates it, breaks it, moistens it, waters
it with this prolifick Dew, and gives it as much of it to drink as the
weight of Nature requires; after this manner the philosophick Germ concentring
the Spirit in its Bosom, is animated and vivyfied by it, and acquires the
Properties which are Essential to its becoming the vegetable and multiplying
Stone. I hope you will be satisfied with this Reasoning, which is founded
on the Laws and Principles of Nature.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>It is impossible for any to be more satisfied than I am; you give me
that Light that the <i>Philosophers</i> have hidden under an impenetrable
Veil, and you tell me Things so important, that I would willingly push
on my Questions, to draw what Benefit I could from the Goodness you have,
to disguise me nothing, but not to trespass too far upon you; I return
to the Passage of my Author, where the <i>Stone</i> maintains to <i>Gold</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>, that it is impossible to make a true Union of their
two Substances; because, says the <i>Stone</i> {31} <i>that you are not
one only Body, but two Bodies together; and by consequence you are contrary,
it the Laws of Nature be considered.</i> I know very well, that the Penetration
of Substances, not being possible according to the Laws of Nature; so neither
is their perfect Union possible, and that in this Sense two Bodies are
contrary to one another; yet as almost all the <i>Philosophers</i> assure,
that <i>Mercury</i> is the first Matter of Metals, and that according to
<i>Geber</i>,
it is not a Body, but a Spirit that penetrates Bodies, and particularly
that of <i>Gold</i>, for which it has visible Sympathy; it is not likely,
that these two Substances, this Body, and this Spirit, may be perfectly
united, to make but one only and the same Thing of one and the same Nature?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Remark that, there are two Errors in your Reasoning; the first in that
you suppose, that common <i>Mercury</i> is the first and sole Matter, whereof
Metals are formed in the Mines, which is not so. <i>Mercury</i> is a Metal,
which having less <i>Sulphur</i>, and less terrene Impurity than other
Metals, remains liquid, and running; it unites with Metals, and particularly
with <i>Gold</i>, as being the purest of all; and it united less easily
with the other Metals, in proportion as they are more or less impure in
their natural Composition. You must therefore know, that there is a first
Matter of Metals, whereof <i>Mercury</i> it self is formed; it is a viscous,
and mercurial Water, which is the Water of our Stone. And this is the Sentiment
of the true <i>Philosophers.</i>
<p>I should be too prolix, if I should here set forth every particular
that can be said upon this subject. I proceed to the second Error of your
Reasoning, which consists in that you imagine, that common <i>Mercury</i>
is a metallick Spirit, which according to <i>Geber</i>, can interiourly
penetrate and tinge Metals, be united and remain with them, after it shall
have been artificially fixt. But you must consider, that <i>Mercury</i>
is not called Spirit by <i>Geber</i>, but from its flying the Fire, because
of the Mobility of the homogeneous Substance; nevertheless, that properly
hinders not its being a metallick Body, which for that Reason can never
be so perfectly united with another Metal, as not to be always separated
from it, whenever it finds it self separated from it, whenever it finds
it self pressed by the Action of the Fire. Experience makes good this Reasoning,
and therefore the <i>Stone</i> is in the right to maintain against <i>Gold</i>,
that there never can be made a perfect Union of it with <i>Mercury.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I comprehend very well, that my Reasoning was Erroneous, and to tell
you the Truth, I could never imagine, that common <i>Mercury</i> was the
first Matter of Metals; though divers grave <i>Philosophers</i> lay down
that Truth, for one of the Foundations of the Art. An I am perswaded, that
one cannot find in Mines, the true first Mater of Metals, <i>separated
from metallick Bodies;</i> it is but a Vapour, a viscous Water, an invisible
Spirit, and I believe, in a Word, that the Seed is not to be found but
in the Fruit. I can't tell whether I speak properly, but I take this to
be the true Sense of the Instructions you have given me.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>One cannot have better comprehended, than you have done these Truths
known to so few. It is a Satisfaction to talk freely with you, concerning
the philosophical Mysteries. What further Questions have you to ask me?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>Does not the <i>Stone</i> contradict it self, when is says {32} <i>That
with an imperfect Body, it has a constant Soul, and a penetrating Tincture?</i>
Methinks these two great Perfections are inconsistent with an imperfect
Body.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>One would say here, that you have already forgotten a fundamental Truth,
of which you were fully convinced before; recollect your self, that if
the Body of the Stone were not imperfect with and Imperfection, nevertheless,
wherein Nature has not finished her Operation, one could not there seek
for, and much less could one be able to find Perfection there. This being
laid down, it will be very easy for you to judge, that the constancy of
the Soul, and the Perfection of Tincture, are not actually; nor in a State
to manifest themselves in the <i>Stone</i>, so long as it remains in its
imperfect Being; but then, when by the continuance of the Work, the Substance
of the <i>Stone</i>hath passed from Imperfection to Perfection, and from
Perfection to <i>plusquam</i> Perfection, the constancy of its Soul, and
the Efficacy of the Tincture of its Spirit, are bought from potentiality
into Art; so that the Soul, the Spirit, and the Body of the <i>Stone</i>,
being equally exalted, compose one whole [Thing] of a Nature, and of a
Virtue incomprehensible.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>Since my Questions give occasion to your speaking Things so extraordinary,
I beg you not to take it amiss, that I continue my Enquiries. I was always
persuaded, that the <i>Stone</i>of the <i>Philosophers</i> was a real Substance,
falling under the Senses, yet I perceive this Author assures the contrary,
in saying {33} <i>Our Stone is invisible.</i> I assure you, that whatever
good Opinion I may have of this <i>Philosopher</i>, he must in this Point
give me leave not to be of his sentiment.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>And yet, I hope, to reconcile you quickly to it. This <i>Philosopher</i>
is not the only one who uses this sort of Language; the greater Part of
them speak after the same manner as he does; and to tell you the Truth,
our Stone is properly Invisible, as well in regard of its Matter, as in
regard of its Form. In regard of its Matter; because although our Stone,
or our <i>Mercury</i>(for there is no difference) does really exist, it
is yet true, that it appears not to our Eyes; at least, not unless the
Artist lend his Hand to Nature to help her to bring forth this philosophical
Production; and this made <i>Cosmopolite</i> say, <i>That the Subject of
our Philosophy hath a real Existence; but that it is not to be seen, but
when it pleases the Artist to make it appear.</i>
<p>The Stone is likewise no less Invisible in regard of its Form; I call
here its Form, the Principle of its admirable Faculties, for this Principle,
this Energy of the Stone, and that Spirit in which resides the Efficacy
of its Tincture, is a pure Astral impalpable Essence, that does not manifest
it self, but by the purifying Effects it produces. The <i>Philosophers</i>
often speak of their <i>Stone</i>, as considered in this Sense. <i>Hermes</i>
understands it so, when he says, <i>That the Wind carries it in its Belly;
and Cosmopolite </i>is not remote from this Father of Philosophy, when
he assures, <i>That our Subject is before the Eyes of the World; that no
Body can live without it; that all Creatures make use of it, but few perceive
it.</i> Well, then, are you not of Author's Sentiment, and must you not
confess, that in whatsoever manner you consider the <i>Stone</i>, it is
truly said to be invisible.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I must have neither Sense nor Reason, it I should not consent to a Truth,
that you make me as it were, touch with my Finger, unfolding to me at the
same time, the most obscure, and most mysterious Sense of the philosophical
Writings. I find my self so illuminated by what you tell me, that, methinks,
the most obscure Authors will be no longer dark to me, I shall however,
be obliged to you, if you please to tell me your Opinion concerning the
Proposition that this Author advances; {34}. <i>That it is not possible
to acquire the Possession of the philosophical Mercury, otherwise than
by Means of two Bodies, whereof the one cannot receive Perfection without
the other.</i> This Passage seems to me so positive, and so precise, that
I doubt not, but that it is fundamental in the Practice of the Work.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>There is none most certainly more fundamental, since this <i>Philosopher</i>
tells you in this Passage, how the Stone is form'd, on which is founded
all our Philosophy; our <i>Mercury</i>or our Stone does indeed take Birth
from two Bodies; but Note, that it is not the Mixture of two Bodies which
produces our <i>Mercury</i>, or out Stone: For I have just shewn you, that
Bodies are contraries, and there can be no perfect Union made of them;
but our Stone on the contrary is born from the Destruction of two Bodies,
which acting one upon another, as the Male and the Female, or as the Body
and the Spirit, after a manner no less Natural than Incomprehensible to
the Artist, who lends it the requisite Help, do intirely cease to be that
which they were before, to bring forth a Production of a miraculous Nature
and Original, and which hath all the necessary Dispositions to be carried
by Art and Nature, from Perfection to Perfection, to a sovereign Degree,
which is above Nature it self.
<p>Remark also, that those two Bodies which destroy themselves, and confound
themselves one in the other for the Production of a third Substance, and
of whom the one holds the place of Male, and the other Female, in this
new Generation, are two Agents, who stripping themselves of their grossest
Substance in this Action, change their Nature to bring forth a Son, of
an Original more noble, and more illustrious than the Parents that give
him Being, and in being Born, he carries visible Marks, that evidently
shew, the Heaven presided at his Birth.
<p>Remark, moreover, that our Stone is born many several Times, but in
every one of its new Births it still draws its Rise from two Things. You
have been just now shown how it begins to be born of two Bodies; you have
seen that it espouses a celestial Nymph, to make but one sole and same
Thing with her; you must know also, that after the Stone hath appeared
a new, under terrestrial Form, it must again be Married to a Spouse of
its own Blood, so that there are still two Things which produce one [Thing]
only of one sole and same Kind; and as it is certain Truth, that in all
the different States of the Stone, the two Things that are united to give
it a new Birth, come from one sole and same Thing; it is also upon this
Foundation of Nature, that <i>Cosmopolite</i> supports an incontestable
Truth in our Philosophy, that is to say, <i>That of one is made two, and
of two one, in which all Operations, Natural and Philosophical, are terminated
without any Possibility of going further.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>How abstruse soever these sublime Truths are, you render them so intelligible,
and so palpable to me, that I conceive them almost as distinctly, as if
they were mathematical Demonstrations. Permit me, if you please, to make
some further Enquiry, that so I may have no further remaining Scruples
about the Interpretation of this Author. I have very well comprehended,
that the Stone born of two Substances of one same Kind, is one whole Homogeneity,
and a third Being, endued with two Natures, which render it of it self
sole sufficient to the Generation of the Son of the Sun; but yet I do not
very well comprehend, how this <i>Philosopher</i> understands {35} <i>That
the only Thing whereof the universal Medicine is made, is the Water, and
the Spirit of the Body.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>You would find the Sense of this Passage self-evident, if you did but
recollect your self, that the first and most important Operation of the
Practice of the fist Work, is to reduce into Water that Body, which is
our Stone, and that this is the most Secret Point of our Mysteries. I have
shewed you, that this Water must be vivified and fertilized by an astral
Seed, and by a celestial Spirit, wherein resides the whole Efficacy of
the physical Tincture: So that if you well reflect upon it, you will confess,
that there is no Truth in our Philosophy, more evident than what your Author
here advances, <i>i.e.</i> that one only Thing, whereof the Sage hath need
to make all Things, <i>Is no other than the Water and the Spirit of the
Body.</i>The Water is the Body, and the Soul of our Subject, and the astral
Seed is the Spirit of it; and it is therefore that the <i>Philosopher</i>
assure, that their Matter has a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I confess my Inattention, and that had I well considered, I had formed
no manner of doubt upon this Passage; but here is another, which, however,
is no great Subject of Scruple; but nevertheless, I could with to know
your Sense of the those Words, <i>viz.</i> that the only Thing which is
the Subject of the Art, and has not its like in the World {36} <i>is yet
vile, and to be had for little cost.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>This Matter, so precious by the excellent Gifts, wherewith Nature has
enriched it, is truly mean, with regard to the Substances from whence it
derives it Original. Their Price is not above the Ability of the Poor.
Ten Pence is more than sufficient to purchase the Matter of the Stone.
But the Instruments, and the Means that are necessary to pursue the Operations
of the Art, require some sort of Expence; which makes <i>Geber</i> say,
<i>That
the Work is not for the Poor.</i> The Matter therefore is mean, considering
the Foundation of the Art because it costs but very little; it is no less
mean, if one considers exteriourly that which gives it Perfection, since
in that regard it costs nothing at all, in as much as all <i>the World
has it in its Power,</i> says <i>Cosmopolite, </i>so that whether you distinguish
these Thing, or whether you confound them, as the <i>Philosophers</i> do,
to deceive the Sot and the Ignorant, it is a constant Truth, that the Stone
is a Thing mean in one Sense, but that in another it is most precious,
and that there are none but Fools that despise it, by a just Judgment of
God.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I shall now be quickly as well instructed as I can with; do me only
the Favour to tell me, how one may know which is the true way of the <i>Philosophers</i>;
because they describe many different, and often in Appearance contrary.
Their Books are filled with an Infinity of various Operations; and Conjunctions,
Calcinations, Mixtions, Separations, Sublimations, Distillations, Coagulations,
Fixations, Desiccations, concerning each of which throws the Artist into
such a Labyrinth, that 'tis scarce possible for them to extricate themselves.
This <i>Philosopher, </i>methinks, insinuates, that as in this great Art,
there is but one Thing; so neither is there but one way, for which he gives
no other Reason but this; he says, {37} <i>That the Solution of the Body
is not made but in its own Blood.</i> I find not any Thing in this whole
Treatise, wherein your Instructions may prove more necessary to me, than
upon this Point, which concerns the Practice of the Work, upon which all
the <i>Philosophers</i> make Profession of Silence: I beseech you, therefor,
not to deny me your Directions in so needful a Point.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>It is not without a great deal of Reason that you make me this Request,
it Regards the essential Point of the Work, and I could heartily wish it
were in my Power to answer as distinctly to this, as I have done to divers
of your other Questions. I protest to you, that I have every where told
you the Truth; and I will still continue to do so; but you know, that the
Mysteries of our sacred Sciences may not be taught, but in mysterious Terms:
I will, however, tell you without any Ambiguity, that the general Intention
of our Art, is exactly to purify and to subtilize a Matter of it self unclean
and gross. And this is a most important Truth, that deserves you should
make Reflection upon it.
<p>Remark, that to attain this End, many Operations are requisite, which
tending all but to one and the same Scope, are not in the main considered
by the <i>Philosophers</i>, but as one sole and same Operation diversly
continued. Observe, that Fire separates at first the heterogenous Parts,
and conjoins the homogeneous Parts of our Stone; that the secret Fire produces
afterwards the same effect; but more efficaciously in introducing into
the matter a fiery Spirit, which opens interiourly the secret Gate which
subtilizes and sublimes the pure Parts, separating them from those that
are terrestrial and adustible. The Solution which is afterwards made by
the Addition of the astral <i>Quintessence, </i>which animates the Stone,
makes a third Depuration of it, and Distillation compleats it entirely;
thus purifying and subtilizing the Stone by many different Degrees, to
which the <i>Philosophers</i> use to give the Names of as many several
Operations, and of Conversion of Elements, it is exalted to that Perfection,
which is the nighest Disposition to conduct it to <i>plusquam</i> Perfection,
by a Regiment proportioned to the final Intention of the Art, that is to
say, unto perfect Fixtion. You see now, that to speak properly, there is
but one way, as there is but one Intention in the first Work, and that
the <i>Philosophers</i> describe not many ways, but because they consider
the different Degrees of Depurations, as so many Operations, and different
Ways, with design (as your Author very well Remarks,) to conceal this Admirable
Art.
<p>As to the Words by which Author concludes, <i>i.e.</i> that the Solution
of the Body is not made but in its own Blood, I must make you observe that
in our Art, there is in three different Times, three essential Solutions
made, wherein the Body is not is not dissolved but in its own Blood, and
that is in the Beginning, in the Middle, and at the End of the Work; take
good Notice of this. I have already shewed you that in the principal Operations
of the Art, there are always two Things, one supplies the place of the
Male, and the other of the Female; one is the Body, the other is the Spirit:
You must make here the Application of it, <i>i.e.</i> that in the three
Solutions that I mention to you, the Male and the Female, the Body and
the Spirit, are not other but the Body and the Blood, and that these two
Things are of one same Nature, and of same kind; so that the Solution of
the Body in its own Blood, is the Solution of the Male by the Female, and
that of the Body by its Spirit. And this is the order of these three important
Solutions.
<p>In vain you would attempt by Fire the true Solution of the Male in the
First Operation, you could never succeed in it, without the Conjunction
of the Female; it is in their mutual Embraces that they confound and change
each other, to produce one whole Homogeneity, different from the them both.
You would in vain open and sublime the Body of the Stone, it would be intirely
useless to you, unless you made it espouse the Wife which Nature hath designed
for it; she is that Spirit, from whence the Body hath drawn its first Original;
which Body dissolves therein as Ice does at the Heat of Fire, as your author
has very well Remarked. In fine, you would attempt in vain to make the
perfect Solution of the same Body, if you should not reiterate upon the
Affusion of its proper Blood, which is its natural <i>Menstruum</i>, its
Wife, and its Spirit altogether, wherewith it so intimately unites, that
from thenceforth they become but one sole and same Substance.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>After all this which you have revealed to me, I have nothing more to
ask you about the Interpretation of this Author. I do very well comprehend
all the other Advantages that he ascribes to the Stone, more than to <i>Gold</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>. I do also conceive how the Excess of the Rage of these
two Champions, transported them to join their Forces to vanquish the Stone
by Arms, not being able to subdue it by Reason; but now being able to subdue
it by Reason; but how is it to be understood, <i>That the </i>{39} <i>Stone
devour'd them, and swallowed them both up, so that there remain'd not any
Track of them.</i>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Know you not that the great <i>Hermes</i> says, <i>That the Stone is
the strong Force of all Forces; for it will vanquish all subtile Thins,
and will penetrate every solid Thing.</i> And your Author expresses the
very same Thing here in other Terms to teach you, that the Power of the
Stone is so great, that nothing is able to resist it. It surmounts indeed
all the imperfect Metals, transmuting them into perfect Metals in such
a manner, that there remains no Track of what they were before.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I very well comprehend these Reasons, and yet I have still remaining
one doubt touching perfect Metals; <i>Gold</i>, for Example, is a Metal
constant and perfect, which, therefore, methinks, the Stone should not
be able to devour.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Your doubts is groundless; for as the Stone, strictly speaking, does
not devour imperfect Metals, but so changes their Nature, that there remains
nothing to know by what they were before; so the Stone not being able to
destroy <i>Gold</i>, nor to transmute it into a more perfect Metal, transmutes
it into a Medicine a thousand Times more perfect than <i>Gold</i>, since
it can then transmute a thousand Times as much imperfect Metal, according
to the Degree of Perfection that the Stone had receiv'd of the Art.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>I perceive the little Foundation there was for my Doubt; but to be plain,
there is so much subtilety in the least Hints of the <i>Philsophers</i>,
that you ought not to think it strange, that I have often stuck upon Thinks
that ought else to have appeared to me sufficiently intelligible of themselves.
I have no more but two Questions to ask you, and the are on the Subject
of the two Advices, that my Author gives to the Sons of the Science, touching
the manner of Proceeding, and the Scope they ought to propose to themselves
in their Search of the universal Medicine. He advises them in the first
Place. to sharpen their Minds, to read the Writings of the wise Men with
Prudence, to Labour with Exactness; to proceed without Precipitation in
a Work so precious: because, says, he {39} <i>That is has its time ordained
by Nature; even as the Fruits which are upon the Trees, and the cluster
of Grapes that the Vine bears.</i> I conceive very well the Usefulness
of these Counsels; but pray, be pleased to explain to me, how this Limitation
of Time is to be understood.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eudoxus</font></b></center>

<p>Your author sufficiently explains it to you by the comparison of Fruits,
which Nature produces in their due Season; this comparison is Exact; The
Stone is a Field which the Wise cultivates, into which Art and Nature have
put the Seed, which is to produce its Fruit. And as the four Seasons of
the Year are necessary to the perfect Production of Fruits, so the Stone
has in like manner its determinated Seasons. Its Winter, during which Gold
and Humidity have Dominion in this Earth thus prepared and sowed. Its Spring,
wherein the philosophick Seed being warm'd, gives Signs of Vegetation and
Increase; its Summer, during which its Fruit ripens, and becomes proper
to Multiplication; and its Autumn, in which this Fruit being perfectly
ripe, rejoices the Wise that have the good Fortune to gather it.
<p>To leave you nothing to desire upon this Subject, I must here make you
observe three Things. <i>First,</i> That the Sage ought to imitate Nature
in the Practice of the Work; and as this wise Worker [<i>viz.</i> Nature]
can produce nothing perfect, if its Motion be made violent, so the Artist
ought to suffer the Principles of his Matter to act interiourly, by exteriourly
administring a Warmth or Heat proportioned to its need, The <i>second</i>
Thing is, that the Knowledge of the four Seasons of the Work, ought to
be a Rule, which the Wise should follow in the different Regiments of the
Fire, in Proportioning it to catch, according as Nature shows it, who has
need of less Heat to put the Trees in Blossom, and to Form the Fruit, than
to make them perfectly Ripe. <i>Thirdly</i>, That though the Work has its
four Seasons, so as Nature has, it does not follow, that the Seasons of
Art, and of Nature, must precisely Answer to each other, the Summer of
the Work may happen without Inconvenience in Nature's Autumn, and its Autumn
in her Winter. It suffices, that the Regiment of the Fire, be proportion'd
to the Season of the Work, it is in that only, that the great Secret of
the Regiment consists, for which I cannot give you a more certain Rule.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>By this Reasoning, and by this Similitude, you give me an open View
upon a Point, of which the <i>Philosophers</i> have made one of their greatest
Mysteries; for the Doctrine of the Regiments is not to be learn'd by their
Writings, but I see with an extream Satisfaction, that in imitating nature
and Beginning the order of Seasons of the Work by the Winter, it cannot
be hard to the Wise to judge, how by the divers Degrees of Heat, which
answer to those Seasons, he can assist Nature, and bring the Fruit of the
philosophical Plant to a perfect Maturity.
<p>My Author in the second Place advises the Sons of Art, to have Uprightness
of Heart; and to propose to themselves an honest End in this Work, declaring
positively to them, that without these good Dispositions, they must not
expect a Blessing from Heaven upon their Labour, upon which all good Success
depends. He assures, <i>That </i>{40} <i>God does not communicate so great
a Gift, but to those that will make a good use of it; and that he deprives
those of it, who design to use if for Commission of Evil.</i> This seems
to be no other than a manner of usual speaking with the <i>Philosophers;
</i>pray
tell me what Reflections ought to be made upon this last Point?
<p>You are sufficiently instructed in our Philosophy, to comprehend, that
the Possession of the universal Medicine, and to the great Elixir, is of
all worldly Treasures the greatest, the most real, and the most valuable
that Man can enjoy. Indeed, immense Riches, supream Dignities, and all
the Greatness of the Earth, are not comparable to this precious Treasure,
which is the sole temporal Good, able to satisfy the Heart of Man. It gives
to him that possesses it, a long Life, exempt from all sorts of Infirmities,
and puts into his Power more <i>Gold </i>and <i>Silver,</i> than is possessed
by all the most mighty Monarchs together. This Treasure hath moreover this
particular Advantage, above all other Blessings of this Life, that he who
enjoys it, finds himself perfectly satisfied, even with its only Contemplation,
and that he can never be troubled with the fear of losing it.
<p>You are likewise fully convinced, that God governs the World; that his
Divine Providence causes, that there reigns an Order, which his infinite
Wisdom has established in it from the beginning of all Ages, and that this
Providence is not that blind Fatality of the Antients, nor that pretended
Chain of Causes, or that necessary Order of Things, that must make them
follow without any Distinction: But on the contrary, you are well persuaded,
that the Wisdom of God presides over all the Events that happen or appear
in the World.
<p>Upon the double Foundation, which these two Reflections establish, you
cannot doubt but that God who disposes Sovereignly of all the Possessions
in the World, never permits that those who apply themselves to the Search
of this precious Treasure, with design to make a bad use of it, should
by their Endeavours come to its Possession; really what Mischiefs might
not be caused in the World by a perverse Spirit, who would have no other
Aim but to gratify his Ambition, and to indulge his Lusts, if he had in
his Power and Possession this certain Means of executing his most criminal
Enterpizes. Wherefore the <i>Philosophers</i>, who perfectly know what
Mischiefs and Disorders might accrue to civil Society, it the Knowledge
to the impious, do not treat it, but with fear, nor speak of it, but enigmatically,
to the end, that is may not be comprehended, but by those whose Study and
Endeavours God will bless.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Pyrophilus</font></b></center>

<p>There can be non that are of good Sense, and who fear God, but must
agree in these Sentiments, and must be fully persuaded, that to succeed
in so great and so important an Enterprize, the Divine Goodness is to be
incessantly supplicated to illuminate our Minds, and to give his Blessing
to our Endeavours. It only remains, that I return you most humble Thanks,
that you have been pleased to treat me as a Son of the Science, to discourse
with me sincerely, and to instruct me in so great Mysteries, as clearly,
and a intelligible, as is lawful to do, and as I would reasonably desire.
I protest to you, that my Acknowledgment shall last as long as my life.

<center>Of the <b>True Matter</b>, of which those who
<p>have traced Nature, do prepare the <i>Philosopher's</i> Stone,
<p>be Means of a due Management, with Help of <i>Lunar Vulcan</i>.
<p>Describ'd by an Experienc'd <i>Philosopher.</i>
<p>Translated from the <i>German</i> Original.
<p><font size=+1>Disputation of Gold <i>and </i>Mercury, <i>with the </i>Stone
of the<b> </b>Philosophers.</font></center>

<p>A true <i>Philosopher</i> writes thus: By God Almighty, and upon my
Salvation, do I tell you (you Lovers of this excellent Art) form a sincere
Heart, and out of Compassion for those which have sought a long time in
vain, that our {1} whole Work comes forth out of one Thing, which is compleated
in it self, and needs no more but to be {2} dissolved and recoagulated;
and this it must do of it self, without all foreign things.
<p>As Ice, which is put over the Fire in a dry Vessel, and by Heat turn
into Water: {3} In the same manner it is with our Stone, which wants nothing
but the help of the Operation of the Artist, and of the naturel {4} Fire.
For of it self it cannot do it, although it should lie [or remain] for
ever in the Earth, therefore it must be assisted; yet not so, as to join
foreign and contrary Things with it. But thus, as God gives us the Corn
in the Field, and we must grind and bake it for to make Bread thereof:
In like manner in this; {5} God has created for us this Mineral, [or Oar]
which we take by it self, destroy the gross Body, extract the interiour
Goodness, put away the Superfluity, and make out of the Poison, a Medicine.
<p>That you may understand this the better, I'll recite you a fine Dialogue
and Disputation which happen'd betwixt the <i>Stone</i> of the <i>Philosophers,
Gold,</i> and <i>Mercury,</i> by which those who know a little [or in some
Measure] how to {6} deal with Metals and Minerals, (having sought a long
time in vain,) may easily arrive to the true Foundation. An it will be
necessary, that one learn to know {7} the exteriour and interiour Quality
of each Thing in the Earth, and what it is radically capable of, [or what
it is capable of by (the Foundation of) Nature.]
<p><i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury</i> came at a certain time to a Stone with
and armed Hand, int eh Intention to subdue it.
<p>And <i>Gold</i> began thus in a rude manner, saying.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>You poisonous Worm and Dragon, {8} why do you pretend to be above me
and my Brother <i>Mercury?</i> Being, I am the most high, most noble, and
most constant Metal; and all Princes and Lords, and likewise all ordinary
Men, seek to obtain Riches from [or to grow Rich by working with] me and
my Brother <i>Mercury</i>, whereas you are an Enemy of all Men and Metals,
and you know, that the Physicians praise me exceedingly to be {9} for the
Health of Men?
<p>To which the <i>Stone</i> answereth.
<p>Dear Gold, why are you not angry with God, and enquire, why he hath
not created in you, what is found in me?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>God has given me the Honour, the Beauty, and the Praise, wherefore,
I am desired by the whole World, and because I am the most constant Metal,
in the Fire and out of the Fire, for that Reason I am loved by every Body.
But as for you, you are {10} Volatile, you turn Unfaithful and deceive
the People; for one sees, that you fly away [or escape] out of the Hands
of those that work with you.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>Dear Gold, 'tis true, God has given you Honour, Beauty and Constancy,
for which you ought to be thankful unto God, and not despise others; but
as for your disparaging me thus, you do it with Untruth; and I say, you
are not the Gold, of which the <i>Philosophers</i> write, {11} but the
same is concealed within me: For although it is true that I am Volatile
in the Fire, nevertheless you know, that God and Nature {12} have ordered
me thus, and I must be so for my Volatility is to the Advantage of the
Artist; and if he (the said Artist) can dully the same, yet remains within
me the constant Soul, which is much more constant than you Gold, and all
your Brothers and Companions; no Fire or Water can consume or destroy her,
as long as the World lasts. Nor is it to be imputed to me, that I am sought
for by those, who cannot duly work with me, or prepare me, and join often
foreign and contrary Things with me, such as Waters and Powders, whereby
they destroy my innate Nature and Quality [or Property.] Besides this,
there is {13] not one in an Hundred, that works with me, bul all of them
seek to compleat the Art with you Gold and your Brother <i>Mercury: </i>Wherein
however they err, and work falsely, it being apparent, that all of them
bring nothing to effect, but employ their Gold in vain, destroy [or ruin]
themselves by it, and are reduced to Poverty; which is most to be imputed
to you Sol, who know particularly well, that no true Gold or Silver can
be made without me, for I alone have that Power. Why then do you allow
that almost the whole World work chiefly with you and your Brother <i>Mercury</i>?
If then you were indeed sincere, and did desire to deal honestly, you would
appraise the People, and warn them to avoid Damages; wherefore I may well
say with Truth, that you are the Cheat.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>I'll prove it by the <i>Philosopher'</i>s Sayings, that the Art may
be compleated by me and my Brother <i>Mercury.</i> For read <i>Hermes,</i>
who says thus: {14} <i>The Sun is its Father, and the Moon is its Mother,</i>
now 'tis I who am compared to the Sun.
<p>Likewise <i>Aristotle, Avicenn, Pliny, Serapion, Hippocrates, Dioscorides,
Mesne, Rafis, Averrho&euml;s, Geber, Raymund Lully, Albertus Magnus, Arnold
de Villa-Nova, Thomas Aquinas, </i>and many others, which I omit for Brevity's
sake; all these say plain and distinctly, that the Tincture, as well as
the Metals, must be composed of <i>Suphur</i>and <i>Mercury</i>, and the
{15} <i>Sulphur</i> must be red, incombustible, and constant [or fix'd]
in the Fire, and the <i>Mercury</i> must be bright [or clean] and clearly
purified, and they write without any winding Expressions [or Circumlocution,]
naming me openly by my Name, and say, that in me Gold, is well digested,
constant, [or fix'd] incombustible, red <i>Sulphur</i>, which is also true;
and it is obvious to every body, that I am the most constant Metal, and
have the best <i>Sulphur</i> of all, which cannot be consumed by Fire,
but is quite fixed.
<p>Then <i>Mercury </i>assented with his Discourses to what the Gold had
advanced, and added: It were true, what his Brother, the Gold had told,
and might be prov'd by the aforesaid Masters. And that likewise it were
known commonly and by every Body {16} what great Love and Unity there were
betwixt them two, above all other Metals; which might easily be prov'd,
by only this ocular Demonstration, that when <i>Goldsmiths,</i> or such
like Workmen will guild Things, they cannot do without <i>Gold</i> and
<i>Mercury</i>,
but take them and put them together, and unite them with very little Pains.
What then might not be done, with more Pains and Diligence, with more Work
and longer Labour?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>Then our <i>Stone</i> replyed in a merry Humour: Truly, you both deserve
to be laugh'd at with your Proofs; and I admire more especially of you
<i>Gold</i>,
who boast so very much of your self to be good for a great many Things,
[or Uses,] that you have no more Sense than that comes to; do you think
that the old <i>Philosophers</i> have fitted their Writings barely to the
common literal Sense or Interpretation, and will be understood in that
manner?
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>The aforecited Masters have Writ no Untruth, and they all agree concerning
my Virtue, but there have been some, who have sought for my Virtues in
other improper Things, <i>viz. </i>in various Herbs, Animals, Blood, Urine,
Hair, Sperm, and the like, who therefore have err'd, and perhaps have Writ
erroneously too; but the aforesaid Masters have good Testimony, that they
have possess'd the Art indeed; for which Reason their Writings may very
well be credited.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>I do no ways doubt, and it is very true that they have possess'd the
Art indeed; some however excepted of those whom you have quoted. But when
they name barely the Name of <i>Gold</i> and <i>Mercury,</i> they do it
to hide the Art from the senseless [Dunces] and the unworthy, knowing very
well, that such only dwell upon Names and written Processes, without meditating
further upon the Foundation of this Matter. But the Prudent and Diligent
read with Prudence, and ponder how one Squares with the other; out of which
they get a Foundation; findings thus by Speculation, and from the <i>Philosopher's
</i>Sentences,
the true Matter, which no <i>Philosopher</i> ever named and describ'd openly
by its true Name.
<p>This they prove themselves, when they say, where we write plainest,
[or open] according to the common Sense [or Interpretation] there we have
most concealed the Art. {17} but where we speak by Parables and Sentences,
there we have truly disclosed the Art. And where they write of <i>Gold</i>
and <i>Mercury, </i>they however soon after that, tell and explain themselves,
saying, that their <i>Gold</i> is no common <i>Gold,</i> nor their <i>Mercury</i>common
<i>Mercury</i>;
by Reason, that <i>Gold</i>, because of its Perfection, cannot be alter'd
or chang'd, because it is grown already to a quite perfect Metal; and although
one should extract its Colour a hundred Times, and Work never never so
artful with it, nevertheless it cannot tinge any more, than just so much
as it has Colour and Tincture in it self. Therefore the
<i>Philosophers</i>
say, {18} I you search in imperfect Things, you there will find the Perfection,
as you may read in the Rosary. Likewise <i>Raymund Lully</i>, whom your
self have quoted as a Testimony, says thus: What shall be meliorated, must
not be prefect; nothing is changed [or altered] in perfect Things, it rather
is quite destroy'd and spoil'd.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>I know indeed that they say thus; but that may be understood of my Brother
<i>Mercury</i>,
who as yet is imperfect; and when we two mix our selves with each other,
he then is made perfect by me; for he is of the Feminine, and I of the
Masculine Sex. Therefore the <i>Philosophers</i> say, that the Art is entirely
and Homogeneum. You see the same in Men, that no Child is produced, but
by the conjunction of Male and Female. And the same is to be seen in all
Animals which have life.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>Thy Brother <i>Mercury</i> is indeed imperfect {19} yet therefore is
not he the <i>Mercury</i> of the <i>Philosophers:</i> And if you two should
mix your selves together and were kept in the Fire [or in digestion] for
many Years, it were nevertheless impossible that you two could really be
united together; for as soon as <i>Mercury</i> feels the Fire, he flips
from you going on high, and sublimes it self on the top, leaving you in
the bottom. Or if you are join'd together with corrosive Waters, and are
dissolved, distilled, and coagulated, you yield nothing else but a red
Powder and Pr&aelig;cipitate, which it if is thrown [by Projection] upon
imperfect Metals, it tinges not; but only so much of you <i>Gold</i> is
found again, as was taken at the beginning, and your Brother <i>Mercury</i>
escapes entirely from you; which the Searchers in Alchimy have experienc'd
for many Years, and are convinc'd of it by their own no small damage. But
as for your referring to the Sentences of the Ancients, who say, that the
Art is wholly an Homogeneum, and that no Child can be produced but by Male
and Female, which you fancy, the <i>Philosophers </i>did to hint at you
and your Brother <i>Mercury</i> by it; that is not thus neither, but misunderstood
by you, altho' they (writing thus) speak very right and proper; for I tell
you in Truth, that even this is {19} the Cornerstone laid by the Ancients,
at which many Thousands have stumbled. Do you imagine it is with Metals
{21} just as with other Things, which have Life? You fare in this, as all
those who work wrongly in this Art; when you read these Things in the <i>Philsophers's
</i>Writings,
you do not meditate on the Scope, and whether it agrees with what has been
said before, or what is said after that; for what the <i>Philosophers</i>
have describ'd of this Art with such parabolical Words, is solely to be
applied to me, and to no other Thing in the World; for 'tis I alone that
do perform it, and {22} without me no true <i>Gold</i> or <i>Silver</i>
can be made.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>Good God! Are you not afraid to commit a Sin, and have no shame to tell
such a Lie? And are you so audacious, as to apply [or attribute] solely
unto you, what so many <i>Philosophers</i> and Learned Men have written
of this Art in several Ages? You, who are an only, gross, poisonous, and
unclean Thing, and yet confess, that the Art is an Homogeneum; and you
affirm besides this, that without you, who are {23} the Universal, no true
<i>Gold</i>
or <i>Silver</i> can be made; whereas it is known, that may have sought
so assiduously and diligently, that they have found some other ways, which
are called particulars, from which they may have a good profit.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>My dear <i>Gold</i>, do not wonder at what I have told you, and do not
thus impudently and imprudently give me the Lie, because I am older than
your self. {24} And although I had been mistaken in this, you ought to
spare my Age; for you are not ignorant, that Age should be honour'd.
<p>But to same my Honour, that I spoke Truth, whose Testimonies [being
quoted by your own self,] you have no Reason to object against. And firstly,
<i>Hermes</i>
says thus: In Truth, without Lie, certain, and most true, is this, that
that which is under, is like to that which is above, and that which is
above, is like unto that below, {25} by this you may attain to Miracles
and Wonders of one Thing.
<p>Item, <i>Aristotle</i> writes thus; Oh! What a strange Thing is this,
for it has in it self, all what we stand in need of; it kills it self,
and gets Life again of it self; {26} it espouses it self, it begets it
self, and brings forth [or generates] of it self, it dissolves it self
in its own Blood, and recoagulates it self with the same; it grows White
and Red of it self, and we add nothing more to it, nor do we change any
Thing, only we separate the Terrestreity and the Grossness from it.
<p><i>Item, Plato</i> the <i>Philosopher</i> says thus of me: 'Tis even
by one and the same [or only] Thing in it slef; {27} it has a Body, a Soul,
a Spirit, and the four Elements, over with it has Dominion; and it does
not want to borrow any Thing of other Bodies, for it brings forth [or generates
it self] only of it self, and all Things are in it.
<p>Many Testimonies more of these Masters could I proffer, but it being
unnecessary, I omit them for Brevity's Sake.
<p>However, as for Particulars, of which you make mention, it is thus with
them: Some are come thus far, that they have been able to {28} extract
my tinging Spirit, which they have joined to other Metals, and brought
it about by many Operations, that I have participated to such Metals as
had any Affinity with me, a small Matter of my Virtue and Power; which,
however, but very few succeeded in: Likewise did they partly find it by
Chance. {29} And by Reason that they did not penetrate into the Foundation,
whence Tinctures come, therefore they could not proceed further, and thus
they could not reap very great Advantages therefrom. But if the Artist
{30} had looked further about for my own [proper] Wife, and joined [or
united] me with her, I then could have tinged a thousand Times more: But
they thus spoiled my Nature [or Property] with foreign Things. However,
whatever they found, (although but a small Matter in Comparison of my true
Power and Efficacy,) it proceeded from me, and of no other Thing whatsoever.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gold</font></b></center>

<p>What you have said is no sufficient Proof: For although they [the <i>Philosophers</i>]
write of one only Thing, in which are contained the four Elements, and
a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit; they thereby insinuate [or give to understand]
the Tincture, after the same has been compleatly finished: It must nevertheless
be composed in the beginning of me Gold, and my Brother <i>Mercury</i>,
we being the Male and the Female Seed, as has been mentioned; and when
we are brought to Maturity [or compleated by Digestion] we then are both
[that] one Thing, of which they write.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Our Stone</font></b></center>

<p>It is no ways thus, and I have told you before, {31} that it is not
possible for you two, [to perform it,] for you two are not one Body, but
two Bodies, and you are in the Foundation of Nature [or Radically] contrary
to each other. {32} But as for me, I have an imperfect Body; a pure, penetrating,
tinging, and constant [or fixed] Spirit; and besides this, a clear, bright,
volatile, and moveable <i>Mercury</i>; and am alone capable of what both
of you together do indeed boast of, but are not able to perform it, for
in me is the <i>Philosopher's </i>Gold, and the <i>Mercury</i> of the Wise.
For this Reason the Ancients say: {33} our Stone is not Visible, nor our
<i>Mercury</i>
to be had, but out of the soft {34} uncorrupted [or proper] Bodies, and
neither of the two can be attained without the other; wherefore I alone
do yield the Male and Female Seed; also I am called an <i>Hermaphrodite.</i>
<p><i>Richardus Anglus</i> too, witnesses the same of me, saying: The first
Matter of our Stone is called <i>Rebis</i>, that is to say, a Thing which
by Nature has a double quality [or property] concealed in it self; and
it is likewise call'd an Hermaphrodite, that is, a Matter, which is not
easily to be distinguish'd, whether it be a Male of Female; by Reason,
that it inclines to both Parts. Therefor a Medicine is made, {35} out of
a Thing, [or one Thing] which is the Water of the Body and Spirit.
<p>This has occasioned the saying, that this Medicine has by its <i>Enigma</i>'s
deceived many Fools. The Art, however, requires but one only Thing; [or
Matter;] {36} nothing is to be compared to it, and yet it is mean and cheap:
But for this it ought not to be despised, for it makes and brings forth
[or compleats] admirable things.
<p><i>Alanus</i> the <i>Philosopher </i>says: You Operators in this Art,
you ought to be of fixed Mind in your Work, not beginning and trying sometimes
with one Thing, and sometimes with another; for the Art consists not in
Multitude of Species's, but in Body and Soul. And for a (certain) Truth,
the Medicine of our Stone is one Thing, one Vessel, one Composition. For
the whole [Masterpiece of] Art is begun with one Thing, and is ended with
one Thing; although the <i>Philosophers</i>, in order to hide the Art,
have pretended to point out many other ways, as for Instance: continual
Cooking [or Digestion,] Mixtion, Sublimation, Trituration, and Siccation,
and as many other Names [or Allegories] as the same may be named withal.
{37} However, the Solution of the body is not brought about, but in its
own Blood.
<p><i>Geber</i> says thus: In the Foundation (or in the Root) of the Nature
of <i>Mercury</i>, is <i>Sulphur,</i> which perfects it, [<i>viz.</i> the
<i>Mercury</i>]
by cooking and digesting it during a long time in the Veins of the Mines.
<p>Thus, my dear Gold, with what has been said, you are sufficiently convinced,
that it is only in me, and I alone can perform all, without the Assistance
of you and all your Brothers; not do I want you any ways, although all
of you want me: [Or have Occasion for me:] For I can perfect you all, and
bring you to a higher Degree, than what you are by Nature.
<p>Then the Gold grew angry, and not knowing any more what to answer, consulted
with its Brother <i>Mercury</i>, and agreed upon this, that they would
assist one another, who being two in Number, and our Stone but single,
they (because they could get no Advantage upon it by disputing) would by
their double Power destroy it [or kill it] by the Sword.
<p>But when the Fight began, our Stone issued Strength, [or Power,] {38}
and destroyed and conquered them both: And swallowed them [in such a manner]
that nothing at all was to se seen of them; nor what was become of them.
<p>Thus, you my dearly beloved who fear God, you have here a true and sufficient
Narrative [or Instruction] to understand the Foundation [or Root] of the
highest and most precious Treasure. For no <i>Philosopher</i> did ever
declare himself so plain and openly.
<p>You therefore want nothing else, but that you pray to God that he may
grant you, to attain to such a dear and precious Jewel: Next to this quicken
your Thoughts, and read with Prudence, work with Diligence, and haste not
in [the Preparation of] this precious Work; for {39} it must have its natural
Time, [or its Time ordained by Nature,] like Fruit on a Tree, or Grapes
on a Vine. Be likewise of a good Will and Intention, or else Lord will
grant you nothing; for God gives it to those, who desire to do good with
it, {40} and takes it, or detains it from such as would employ it to ill
Uses.
<p><i>The Lord give you his Blessing</i>. Amen
