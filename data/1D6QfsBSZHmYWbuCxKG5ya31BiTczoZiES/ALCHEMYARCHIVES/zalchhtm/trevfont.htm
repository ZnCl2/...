<blockquote>When I perceived that I had proceeded a considerable length
in this Art, I began most earnestly to court and to frequent the company
of those who were learned in it also: for it becomes good men to join themselves
to their equals and not to others.
<p>Therefore, when I passed through Apulea, a city in India, I heard that
a man resided there who was so very learned in every branch of Science,
that he had not his equal in this world. He instituted as a Prize of disputation
for all skilled in Art, a book fabricated, both leaves and cover, of pure
gold. Therefore, desirous of honour, I did not doubt that my mind would
assist me thereto and dispose me to the prescribed disputations, a very
learned man adding spurs to my undertaking this province, and it also coming
into my mind that the daring and bold were carried to sublime things, while
the timid were thrown down and lived in perpetual dejection, I passed manfully
into the field of contest and happily obtained the palm of disputation
before the audience, and the book of premium was so honourably delivered
to me by the faculty of Philosophy, that I was looked upon by all men.
<p>Then for the sake of recreating my mind, fatigued with study, and enquiring
for pleasant plains and meadows, I met with a most limpid little fountain,
surrounded and fortified with a most beautiful stone in an oaken trunk,
and enclosed within a wall, that brutes might not enter nor birds make
a bath for themselves there. Sitting above this fountain, I contemplated
its beauty and I saw the upper part was shut.
<p>A very venerable old man was coming there. As reverent as a priest,
I honourably saluted him and I asked him wherefore that fountain was shut
and fortified in that manner, above, below, and on every side.
<p>Having deigned to give me a friendly answer, he said, "What you would
know, my friend, is a fountain very terrible and wonderful in virtue before
every other fountain in the world. It belongs to the King alone of this
country, whom the fount knows very well, and he himself the fountain. It
always draws the King, when passing this way, to itself, but is never drawn
by the King. In that Bath he remains 282 days, at the end of which so much
youthful strength is added to him, that he can afterwards be conquered
by nobody however strong. He therefore took care to shut up his little
fountain with a round white stone, as you see, in which a clear fountain
shines like silver and of celestial colour. That it may also be stronger
and lest it should be destroyed by horses or others, he introduced an old
oak cleft in the middle, which protects it from the rays of the Sun, forming
a shade.
<p>"Then, as you see, he surrounds it with a wall very thick. He shuts
it up first with the hard and clear stone, then finally in the cavities
of the oak, chiefly because it is so terrible in its nature that once inflamed
and irritated, it would make its way through every thing, and also should
it escape the fences, there would be an end of us."
<p>I afterwards asked him if he himself saw the King in the said fount,
he answered that he indeed saw him enter, but from that time at which he
is shut up in it by the Keeper, he does not appear more until the 130th
day, at length he emerges bright and splendid. The Keeper Porter assiduously
warms the bath, that he may keep up the heat which is occult in the water
of the fount, and he warms it night and day without intermission.
<p>I again interrogated what colour was the King?
<p>He answered that the first of his vestures was from the beginning Cloth
of Gold, then with a black velvet doublet, a shirt truly white above the
snow, his flesh however, or blood is of the richest reds.
<p>I then asked whether the King on coming there brought with him a great
concourse of extraneous people low and vulgar along with him?
<p>He answered me friendly but laughing at the question, saying, "When
the King purposes to come hither, he dismisses all his counsellors and
every stranger and enters alone, nobody approaching the fount except himself
and its Keeper alone, the care of which a very simple man has. Verily the
simplest man can best supply his place, since he does nothing else than
warm the fount."
<p>I again enquired whether the King was a friend to the fount, or the
fount a friend to him?
<p>He answered, "They love one another reciprocally in a wonderful manner,
the fount attracts the King and not the King the fount, for it is as it
were the Mother to the King."
<p>I next interrogated of what kind the King was?
<p>He answered, "He comes from the fount which makes him such as he is
without any other thing whatever."
<p>I enquired whether he had many counsellors. He said he has six forsooth
who expect the succession, if by any chance or any means the King should
die, they will also rule the Kingdom like him; hence it is that they serve
him because they hope from him Dominion and possessions.
<p>Then I asked whether he was an old man.
<p>He answered, that he was older than the forest and more mature than
any of his own subjects.
<p>How happens it therefore, I asked, that these do not kill the King who
expect so much inheritance from his death, since he is so old?
<p>He answered, "Although he is so much advanced in years, nevertheless
no one of his subjects is so patient of cold and sweats rains winds and
labours as himself. Also no one of them by himself, nor any of them together
could kill him."
<p>How then will they possess the Kingdom if he cannot die not be killed
by any one?
<p>He answered, "His six subjects are from the fount, from which they possess
everything they have, as well as he, wherefore they are chiefly drawn by
the fount. The King is killed by that very fount as well as they are resuscitated
by it afterwards, from the substance of his Kingdom, which substance is
divided into the minutest particles, each of his subjects receives his
portion and however minute the particle which any one of them has, he equals
the King in power and strength and opulence, and they are made equal among
themselves."
<p>I again enquired, how long they might have to wait in this expectation?
<p>Laughing at me again he answered, "Know that the King enters alone without
any of his subjects, for although the fount also loves them, yet they do
not enter, because they have not yet described this dignity. But the King
upon entering throws off his vesture of fine beaten gold, which he delivers
to his first Chamber Man called Saturn, who when he has once obtained possession
of it keeps it for forty days, sometimes forty two days at most. Then the
King throws off the Black Velvet waistcoat, which he delivers to his second
Chamber Man, called Jupiter, who keeps it 22 days. Then the King ordering
him, Jupiter gives it to Luna, which third person is beautiful and resplendent.
She keeps it 20 days. Then the King is in a shift, pure white as snow,
or like fine pearls or a white lily, which also he puts off and delivers
to Mars, who keeps it 40 days and sometimes two more. Afterwards Mars by
the will of God, delivers it to yellow Sol, not clear Sol, who keeps it
40 days. Then comes the most beautiful and blooded Sol who immediately
snatches up the shirt."
<p>I then asked him what is the meaning of all this, and he answered, "The
fount is then opened, and as he had given them his shift, his waistcoat
and his vestment, at this moment he delivers to them his blood red flesh
to eat and now at length they have their desire."
<p>Again I asked whether they always waited so long a time, and whether
they had remuneration for their services, to induce them to persevere to
the end?
<p>He answered, "Four of these Counsellors, the moment they have obtained
the white shirt may rejoice if they please, and also enjoy the greatest
riches, but this only gives them the half part of the Kingdom. Wherefore,
they rather wish to wait a little longer for the end, and wait that they
also may be crowned with the Royal Diadem of their Monarch."
<p>I asked whether any Physician attended or anything else whatsoever at
that time.
<p>He answered, "No, nor any thing whatever except the Keeper alone, who
excits below a continual surrounding and vaporous heat, except this there
is nothing else."
<p>I asked whether this Keeper underwent much labour?
<p>He answered, "He suffers more at the beginning than towards the end,
because the fount is then heated."
<br>I asked whether many people saw the work.
<p>He answered, "It is done out of the sight of all the world, not one
in the world even knows. The whole world have it before their eyes and
do not know it."
<p>I asked once more what do they next?
<p>He said, "If these six wish again to purge the King they could do it
in the fount in three days, by surrounding the place so as to satisfy the
contents, by giving him back on the first day - the waistcoat, on the second
- the shirt, and on the third day - his blood red flesh."
<br>I asked to what purpose is all this?
<p>He said, "I am wearied with what I have already told you."
<p>Which when I perceived this, I was unwilling to be troublesome. I bid
him farewell giving him many great thanks, and seeing him home to his residence.
The old man was so reverend and so very wise, that the heavens obeyed him
and all things trembled before him.
<p>I was sleepy and returning to the fountain, I sat down to rest a little,
when I could not abstain when sitting upon it from opening all the fastenings
in a secret manner. In the meantime when I looked upon the book which was
the reward of my disputation, and by its splendour and beauty increased
my sleepiness and in a slumber it fell out of my sleepy hands into the
fount, which happened very unluckily, for I wished to preserve the memorial
of my having the honour of being an adept. And when I looked it had disappeared
from my eyes, thinking therefore that it had fallen to the bottom, I began
to draw out the water with such great care, however, that nothing more
might remain in it than a tenth part of it, with scarcely ten parts, and
when I attempted to draw out the whole, they obstinately adhered together.
<p>In the meantime while I was labouring with the work, some people came
upon me so that they hindered me from drawing out any more. Before I went
away however, I shut all things again lest any body might perceive that
I had exhausted or seen the fountain, or lest perhaps they might forcibly
steal the Book from me. Then the heat began to be excited round about in
the bath for the purpose of bathing the King. But I was taken to prison
and detained 40 days for having perpetrated the crime.
<p>After I was relieved, I returned to the fount that I might see it, obscure
clouds appeared which lasted a long time. To conclude, I saw every thing
at the end that my prize derived without much labour.
<p>It will not torment you very much if you enter upon the right path and
not leave it for erroneous ones, but imitate nature in every thing. In
concluding I say unto you that whosoever upon reading of this book does
not understand the Stone by himself, will never understand the work, however
much he may operate. For in this very parable, the whole work is contained,
in practice, days, colours, regimens, ways, dispositions and continuations,
which I have narrated, moved by piety, charity, and compassion alone towards
desolate operators in this most precious secret.
<p>Therefore, in making of my book I beseech the Lord God, whose grace
is absolute, that he may open the minds of men of good will, to whom if
ingenious there will be little difficulty, only they must abstain from
the dreaming phantasies and the subtleties of Sophists and always remain
in this way of nature which is demonstrated by my speculations.
<p>Farewell in Jesus Christ always and be mindful of the poor, when you
obtain this inexhaustible treasure.
<p>Pray to God, who will teach you more.
