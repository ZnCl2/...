Stone</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>In this prologue you will be taught of what kind of work everybody should
be aware.
<p>My child, you must know that in this Art there are many mistakes, especially
in the Vegetable Work. The reason for this is the following: In the Vegetable
Work there is much coagulating, dissolving, and rectifying to well prepare
the spirits so that they do not fly away; also much aquafort has to be
made and many watery spirits fixed. It requires much regulating of the
fire and much concern lest the spirits break the vessels, for their fat
moisture often causes the glasses to burst if they are given too strong
a fire when they are about to become fixed. Then they rise and stay locked
within the glass, and in rising (expanding) they break the glass. Then,
all one’s labor is lost, and, therefore, one has to be on guard. This then
is the great worry, as you well now if you have attempted to do some work,
In addition, much work and time are required for the rectification of the
wine; also, much work to make the Water fixed and to keep the spirits from
flying away. All that requires a long time, as is known by all who have
tried it. Further, much work and time are required for the putrefaction
and digestion, which have to be handled very delicately with the proper
regimen, not too weak and not too strong. Also, one has to be cautious
at all times to keep the regimen (of fire) with great care, as many are
already well aware.
<p>There is still another problem. That is, to calcine and improve the
Bodies and the Earth in such a way that they are not burnt in the glass
or become dry. Therefore, one has to take special care to maintain a good
regimen of the Fire and to work with great caution.
<p>Furthermore, the Earth must be calcined and clarified, then the Water
again distilled, as so forth with all the operations that are a part of
this work.
<p>Moreover, in the composition, one must not take too much of one and
too little of the other, because, if you have well preserved your fatness
in the beginning, the medicine has no ingress, then you will have worries
with your work and the possibility of it being spoiled. Thus, there is
much danger, great expense, and if we believe that we have done everything
right and that nothing is lacking in the prescribed process, we may yet
have been careless and kept the fire too hot or not hot enough, through
negligence. If we now wish to make a projection with our work and it does
not do what we intended it to do, and we therefore do not obtain any benefit
from it, and we do not know what may be wrong or how it could have happened,
it is still the non-observance of the details of the prescribed manipulation
which we have here related.
<p>Therefore, I advise you, my children, not to undertake the Vegetablili
Opus for the above mentioned reasons, because a small error might spoil
your work and then all you have invested in time and money is lost. This
is why I advise you to be very careful with the Vegetable Work, because
of the separation of the elements, the separation and rectification required
in it, also on account of the serious worries you will have for a long
time and the many kinds of uncertainty which may occur. The work takes
a long time and it is difficult to see the end.
<p>If you lose the natural moisture at the beginning, your work will become
too dry in its composition; or if it loses some Spirit of Air in the distillation
due to a faulty vessel or leak in the luting, you will lose your high projection.
If you lose some in the Fire, your medicine will not tincture much and
will also lose its ability to ingress. If it has too much Air, it will
fly away, if it has too much Water, the Spirits will drown so that it cannot
be fixed, If it has too much Earth, it will be to dry, so that it can neither
melt no have ingress. Therefore the work of the separation of the Elements
involves a great deal of concerns, as many mistakes can occur.
<p>Likewise in the rectification, and if anything in the Elements is spoiled,
no matter how little, the whole work is spoiled! That is why I advise you,
dear Sons who are afraid of all operations in which the Elements have to
be separated, be it in the Animal, Mineral, or Vegetable Works, or in the
Stone which god has given us for nothing: When the preparation of the Stone
has reached the stage of the separation, be afraid for your work because
of the uncertainty connected with it. For, it can easily happen that in
the beginning and in the middle, some of its moisture can be lost and then
the whole work is lost. Because if one tries to put it together, it cannot
be combined, and its ingress has also been taken from it. In such a case,
your time and expense and labor have been wasted.
<p>There have been masters (the ancient ones) who have done this work,
but they only did it in order to understand nature as they had done the
great Work before and thus did not have to worry about the cost or labor.
Further no great amount of investigation (research) was necessary. We shall
discuss this Great Work later, if it be the will of God.
<p>There have also been other artists and philosophers who worked toward
miraculous amalgamations, fixations, multiplications and many other marvelous
operations which they called 'short works' of one month, or perhaps 8-10
weeks, but which take so long they do not know how to conclude them on
account of the mishaps that occur in the work. For they do not preserve
their natural moisture at the beginning or the middle of the work, so that
it becomes quire dry; or they cook it too hard or too cold or too long
on the fire, with the result that it loses its ingress and ability to melt.
<p>Therefore, avoid all amalgamations, multiplications and fixations because,
while you may believe that they will go very fast, they will actually take
a very long time and thus involve so much concern and labor that you will
scarce be able to see the end. In addition, there is the uncertainty connected
with the required washing and purification, for no fixation can be made
before the Spirit and the Body have been cleaned of all their faeces. However,
no fixation or new ingress can occur, even after the washing, cleaning
and dissolution, if you lose the Spirit’s moisture --- then all is lost.
<p>Consequently I advise you to avoid all operations requiring washing
and cleaning because of the worries, burden, time and expense pertaining
to them. Likewise, of a separation of the Elements is to be done, or a
distillation, calcinations or coagulation, due to the possible dangers
of which I have previously spoken, avoid such operations.&nbsp; Consider
that if just one mishap occurs as mentioned above --- and there are thousands
I have nor mentioned since the recounting would take much time to relate
---- all your expense and time would be lost. This would cause you to become
impatient or be discouraged.
<p>Therefore, stay with the Great Art, or the great Elixir, as your foregathers
did. When you have accomplished that, you may try other operations of Nature
with greater confidence. But if you do otherwise, you are not following
my advice. To begin with, take in hand the Great Work, because there is
no worry in it. Nothing in it is distilled, dissolved, coagulated or purified.
In it there are no unknown works or things, no impure things that hav e
faces. Nor do you calcine as there is no need for it. You do not separate
any Elements, because they are pure. It is one species, one thing, one
vessel, one furnace, and one work --- to the White and to the Red.
<p>Therefore, no danger will befall this work. It is nothing but a woman’s
work and merely child’s play. Ignorant men cannot understand this simply
because this work is so easy. This because the Great Work dissolves, purifies,
coagulates, sublimates, and congeals itself! It also makes itself easy
to melt, just like wax, and perfects itself into that which it is supposed
to become.
<p>Now, dear Sons, I have shown you many of the accidents that may occur
in your work, and you may encounter thousands more of them, about which
I will not write for the sake of brevity. Be wise, therefore, so that you
are not ruined if you should meet with any of them. I told you so before,
in plain words and without any parables. If I were to write to you about
Sebbal, Carabric, Marmeth, Sebbaim, Mirrath, Alleb and Raphirib, etc.,
etc., how difficult it would be for you to understand! But I have now revealed
this matter to your mind and to your understanding, so that you should
not fail in this regard.
<p>Therefore, I recommend the great Work to you, for in it there is no
failure, worry, work or vigil. Nor can it be spoiled, unless it be done
deliberately. You need no foreign spirits, or conjuring, or a multitude
of glasses, you only need one vessel and no more, one species of matter
and no more, one oven and no more. That is why Geber says: Our Stone is
one species, one thing. Therefore ignorant men cannot understand it. No
foreign things that are not of its nature are added to our Stone. Ignorant
men wish to bring it into its nature because they are unable to congeal
this one thing. But when they do succeed in congealing it, they are right
back to where they started from. Then it is nothing but earth that has
lost its moisture. It cannot flow and it has no ingress. This is true because
they stop when they should actually start (the work). Now, if they knew
of what species this subject is and recognized its father and mother, sister
and brother, arm in arm, mouth to mouth, they would die at once! If they
would recognize and understand these things, they would obtain all their
desires from the Art, and all their works would end happily.
<p>Dear Sons, I have revealed all this to you in clear words. Therefore,
do not undertake anything with unknown operations before you have accomplished
the Opus Magnum. Following that, start whatever you wish and do not spare
any expense or time because you will have as much of both these as you
want. I have mentioned the many accidents that may occur, and there are
many others as well. But you should know that there exists an easy rule
of which the Philosophers all speak of in a strange way, using parables
and expounding it under veiled names, and yet, they are all referring to
the great Work. Those who are able to perform the Great Work can also understand
all the parables and the veiled words. In addition, you should understand
and know about this work that the true Art is in al things, and it is true!
You are to understand it as follows: Every determined thing contains its
perfect medicine, though it is in an unprepared form. If you know how to
prepare it, you neither need to buy or to have any other medicines. All
this needs to be understood.
<p>No disease in the world can come upon a man because he has the perfect
remedy within himself whereby he can completely recover. That is, providing
he knows how to prepare it properly. He can obtain it from himself and
prepare it so it will not harm his body. The same applies to all animals,
birds, plants and anything created by God. It is indeed so, but ignorant
men cannot understand what the old sages said and they think they can make
a medicine from all things. That is why they take eggs, blood, urine and
the like, believing that they can thereby bring into perfection, imperfect
bodies. And when they have done, they are still at the start and remain
immersed in their stupidity.
<p>But my child should know that a man generates a man. A horse generates
a horse, a bird a bird, each its like, otherwise it would be contrary to
Nature. This is the reason that metal cannot be made from such sperm as
blood and eggs. Where there is nothing, do not try to extract anything
from an imperfect thing. To transmute metals into Sol and Luna from such
is against Nature and reason. Clearly it is not possible. It is a wonder
that some should have seized upon such a fantasy. If they understood the
workings of Nature, they would never have made such a mistake.
<p>Know that all oils of metals re elixirs, likewise all salts, It is also
known that all imperfect metals contain within them their medicine. How
much better will be the oil of Sol or Luna as both are perfect.
<p>Dear Sons, you should know that a perfect medicine can be made from
all metals, which can transmute all imperfect metals into gold and silver
without separation of the elements, also without distilling, sublimating,
dissolving or fixing. It dissolves itself and purifies itself, it coagulates
itself, distills, sublimates, congeals and calcines itself! It can also
cause itself to melt and flow. Furthermore, it is also possible to extract
oils from all metals in different ways. Likewise, salt can be extracted
from all metals without separation of the Elements, and this concerns the
Great Work!

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Here Begins the Work of the Ancients with Perfect Instruction,</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>With Nothing Being Omitted from This</font></b></center>

<p>Now, dear Sons, we shall write about the Magnum opus (Great Work) which
our forefathers used in many different ways. They all reached their goal,
but their Stone did not make the same projection, but one made a higher
than the other after they had made the work subtle. After that, they also
obtained high colors. The ancients worked long before they produced the
Stone. With subtlety, they shortened the work, just as it is being done
today. Understand, our parents required three or four years before they
could perfect the Stone. This was because at that time, they knew no strong
water, only distilled vinegar. Now, their descendants have invented aquafort
(AF); which has greatly shortened the work. You should know that the work
can be shortened even more through the first labor, in as much as one must
make the metals subtle and mingled, so that it turns into a dough-like
matter. That is why Hermes Philosophus says: Do not be lazy at the beginning
of your work; cleanse your subject well and clearly, and conjoin it subtly,
so that you can rejoice afterwards. Geber, Dandin and Morienus also say:
Unite well the water with the earth and the moist with the dry so that
you see later the blackness of the sea, that is, its black color, which
you should see during putrefaction, which is to occur in 24 days, with
a gentle fire. It is a favorable sign of good union.
<p>Therefore, my child, be diligent in the beginning, so that you prepare
your material carefully and well; for as soon as it is put in the fire,
you have already done all your work and must not be concerned about anything
but the regulation of the fire. You must know that I intend to relate afterwards,
many operations, which are always perfect.
<p>First, our parents worked towards amalgamations, with Sol and Luna,
which is a very perfect work, yet rather long. However, it is also the
most surest and the one with the least worries. They also undertook amalgamation
in a variety of ways. Nonetheless, they all reached their goal, though
not with the same height of projection. Further, some among them shortened
the work more than others through subtlety, as we will teach in the Vegetable
Work.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Work of the Old Masters</font></b></center>

<p>Know, dear Sons, that there were some old alchemists who took fine silver,
well refined in the crucible and filed as subtly as possible, 3 Lots, and
fine old cemented through the cement regale, 1 Lot; well purified Mercury,
8 Lots. They amalgamated all this well in an iron mortar with a steel pestle,
grinding it for 12 or 14 hours. After this, they put it in a stone or glass
vessel, formed as illustrated (a round-bottom Florence flask), set it in
sand so hot that one could not keep one’s finger in it, and they let it
stand thus to allow the moisture to evaporate. In the morning they found
that the matter was hard. Again they put it in the mortar, added yet half
a part of Mercury, or 4 Lots, to make the inner parts even. They continued
with this manual labor till the matter could be pressed dry though a double
linen cloth. Thereafter, they set it for another 8 days in the sand with
its vessel, and pounded the matter in the mortar every day for 8 hours
without stopping.
<p>When the 8 days are over, take the matter and put it in a glass as illustrated
(Florence flask), press on the opening a piece of cut glass that closes
it tightly, add a weight and set it in tripodem, and heat it so much that
you can keep you hand between the walls of the furnace and the glass which
contains the matter. Thus they kept the fire going day and night for six
weeks, and at the end of the six weeks they increased it a little, as if
to keep lead in fusion. They maintained this heat until they saw perfect
blackness. Then they rejoiced, as under the blackness is hidden the whiteness,
and it is a sure sign that the matter has been well conjoined at the beginning.
Remember also that you must lift the over from the furnace on the third
day and see of some drops of Mercury adhere to the glass above. You must
shake them down, and if they do not fall down, remove the glass and brush
them down with a feather to make them drop down again on the matter. Now
stopper the glass again, and do this each time on the third and fourth
day.
<p>It is so much better to give only a little heat, to prevent the matter
from rising. It will take more time, but that does not matter. It is better
to have a sure result than an uncertain one, as you might spoil your Work
with too much heat. Watch out, too, that you do not get the red color before
the white one, because one color changes into another. These are also many
foreign colors, but you must not heed them. Pay attention only to the three
colors, which must appear in the Work: First, the blackness, then the whiteness,
and finally the redness. Between these three colors there will appear many
colors, more than one can imagine, but do not pay attention to them. They
are flying spirits which are not yet fixed, and they are poisonous. As
long as you see the foreign spirits, beware of the air, as it might kill
you. The first red colors that show up appear with a gentle regimen of
the fire, or if the fire is increased only a little.
<p>In this Art there is no worry except how to regulate the Fire. But if
you wish to be very sure, keep your fire as small as possible. Then you
cannot go wrong, although it takes somewhat more time. Therefore I advise
and teach you, dear Sons, not to heat too strongly, so that you do not
get the red color before the white one, because this same red color, if
it appeared before the white, would look in the glass like pulverized bricks,
like grains of wheat or barley, or larger, with intermixed grains of live
Mercury, and it would attack the glass. Then all your Work would be spoiled.
If this does happen, it is solely due to the too strong fire. The right
color, however, does not look like bricks but is a clear dark and brown-red.
It is more a heavenly color than a red one, and is due to a good regimen
of the fire, as will be taught later. I am telling you of these colors
so that you do not fall into error because of ignorance, and do not know
what to do or what to omit.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now We Will Proceed Further With Our Work</font></b></center>

<p>If with a small fire something rises in the neck of the glass or on
the cover, open the glass and push it back to the bottom, as I have told
you. Keep it standing thus day and night till your matter becomes completely
pulverized. The powder should be grey and black, like earth that has lost
its moisture. Before you come to this color, you will see various strange
things, because the matter will become motley and speckled, which all the
painters and goldsmiths cannot counterfeit. As the matter becomes riper
and stronger, a change occurs, and before you reach the grey-black powder,
your matter will become a lovely yellowish, like wood, or peat ash. All
this happens with a low regimen of the fire for a long time and watch whether
your matter retains this color or whether it becomes whiter and brighter.
Of it becomes whiter or paler, keep the same regimen of the fire. But if
the color is such that you can neither see nor sense that it changes somewhat,
increase the fire a little till you notice the color becoming paler or
whiter. Then let it stand for a long time in the same regimen of the fire,
always taking care not to make it too strong, till your matter is white,
yea, whiter than snow. Then be glad, dear children, and be sure that under
the whiteness the beautiful redness lies hidden.
<p>Morienus says: When Christ lay in the tomb, a resurrection was to take
place, and after that resurrection a glorious Body shall live in all eternity,
and be crowned with a red diadem, and shall be king over all his line,
and all his enemies shall make peace with him, and he shall remain king
for ever and ever.
<p>You must understand that this white matter or earth is nothing but an
earth that has lost its moisture and is still of no use. That is why you
must know that there are many mistakes in this Art, for there are many
who dare to make the Philosophers’ Stone, and indeed reach this degree
with a good regimen of the fire, and endeavor to fix this Stone to the
White or the Red. When this matter or Stone is fixed, they believe that
they can make projection by throwing it on raw Mercury or other imperfect
metals --- but to no avail. Then they become despondent and say that the
Art is impossible. True, it is impossible for them, because their earth
has lost its moisture, just as Geber says: Spirits which have lost their
moisture due to many sublimations and fixation are useless as long as they
are earth and therefore dry like the latter. The ignorant do not understand
this, and after they have made their Stone and it has the right color,
it must again be made subtile and volatile if it is to have ingress and
make projection. However, they do not understand the words of the wise.
They may well know how to make the Stone and do indeed make it as it is
supposed to be made, but they abandon the Work just when they should begin
to labour properly, and thus they remain in their foolish error.
<p>You must know, dear Sons, that I wish to reveal here the real secret
of the Art. Therefore I beseech you, by the living God, not to disclose
the secret except to your own Sons, provided you believe that they have
the love of God and that your soul, and also mine, will not be damned because
of it, as great troubles might result. Open your eyes and ears, see and
hear the great sacredness in nature, namely, that all Philosophers’ Stones,
no matter how they are composed, can be made and completed in the Great
Work of which we are here speaking, both to the White and to the Red, in
one vessel and one furnace.
<p>Remember well what I am telling you: If you combine Luna and mercury
with Sol in this manner, you can make the Stone from them, either to the
White or to the Red, in one vessel and in one furnace.
<p>Now someone might ask: Why then must Luna and Sol be taken together
in this Work?
<p>The reason is that Sol is fixed, and therefore the Work will be the
shorter for it. If your Luna were fixed in the Work, the Philosophers Stone
would be ready. But it is not fixed, and before it becomes fixed, much
time and cooking are required, as Luna must be fixed before it congeals
Mercury. This is the reason why Luna and Sol are used together in the Work.
You can also make both Stones with Mercury and Sol alone, and that would
take les time than with Luna and Sol together, the reason being that Sol
is fixed and that therefore it congeals Mercury somewhat.
<p>Someone might ask: If one were to take only Luna and Mercury together,
what would be the result? Could the red Stone also be prepared from them?
<p>This is to be understood as follows: Luna is red in its innermost just
as it is white outside, for under all white things that contain the four
Elements, there is a redness inside, covered with the white on the outside.
Luna is cold and moist, just as Mercury and Luna coagulated together. They
are still raw and unfixed, and that is why they are white outside and red
inside.
<p>When Luna is alone in the Work with Mercury, it has to be completely
cooked and congealed with a good regimen of the fire. When it has become
fixed, it congeals the Mercury and becomes a white Philosophers’ Stone.
By increasing the fire and cooking it for a long time, the white Stone
is colored red, its tincture comes out and the whiteness goes inside.
<p>Consider well, dear children, what I have said and still have to say.
It is absolutely necessary, for it is the secret of all works. There have
been some ignorant men who after making their Stone to the White and the
Red, saw that it had no ingress and did not flow like wax. Seeing that
the ingress was lacking, they dissolved the Stone, coagulated it again
20 or 30 times, hoping to make the Stone fusible in this Way, so as to
give it ingress. They did not succeed, and even if they were to dissolve
and coagulate till Doomsday, their Stone would remain as it had been before.
<p>There have been others who extracted an oil from Antimony. With that
they pounded the Stone on marble, dried it again in a glass, imbibed it
so long and so much that the Stone became liquid like wax and had an ingress.
Then they threw it on red-hot Mercury, and as soon as the Mercury glowed,
it flew away and the oil followed it. The powder of the Stone was left
behind in the crucible just as it had been before they imbibed it. This
was due to the fact that the oil had not yet been fixed, and although the
Stone was liquid, the oil was not congealed with the Stone. The reason
is: If the Stone were then thus imbibed and put in a glass with a gentle
heat, the oil would become dry with the Stone. If it were given a strong
fire, however, the oil would fly away altogether from the great heat. That
is why the oil cannot be congealed together with the Stone. Thus the ignorant
have remained in their error.
<p>Now I will teach you, my child, how to make the Stone fusible and to
give it ingress, which has never before been revealed. Therefore, dear
Sons, keep the secret to yourselves, if you love God, your soul and mine,
<p>After your Stone has become white by means of good regimen of the fire,
as I taught you before, you can keep it white, if you like. But if you
want it to become red, you must let it stand much longer in the furnace,
increasing the fire considerably. When you see that it begins to become
yellow like mastic, do not make the fire stronger. Let it stand thus in
great heat or 8 or 9 days, and look if the Stone has become somewhat more
yellow. If it is the same color, increase the fire considerably, and if
it begins to take on the color of saffron (crocus) let it stand in the
same regimen for 8 or 9 days.
<p>Proceed thus continually with the regimen of fire till you see the perfect
redness, like a glowing old in the fire, and it appears to be more a heavenly
color than an earthly one.
<p>Thus the Stone must be cooked with a strong fire, as a small fire does
not cause its tincture and sulphur --- that is, its red tincture --- to
come forth. And before it obtains its perfect redness, it must stand for
41 days.
<p>Know that if the Stone were liquid, its redness could not be brought
out because it would melt in becoming red-hot and even penetrate through
the glass and thus be lost, since it must finally glow for 3 days. Concerning
this, you have to take not that the Stone must first be made before it
is made fusible. This the ignorant cannot understand or remember, because
they do not know Nature. Therefore, both the white and the red Stones must
be made before they are made fusible and subtle, as you yourselves may
understand.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now, Hear My Sons, the Greatest Secret ---</font></b></center>

<p>That lies in the Art and which has never been put in writing except
now by myself, how to prepare and melt the two Stones, so as to make a
high projection with them.
<p>Take your Stone and imbibe it with clean Paradise Water. Unite it with
the water, imprison it, and close tightly. It will rise to heaven in one
cycle of the moon, will be converted into dew and come down again in drops,
in accordance with the teaching of the master. It will moisten the earth
that it may bring forth flowers of varied colors. At the appearance of
those flowers, your Stone will rise from the dead and take on a new body,
and all its enemies shall make peace with it, and the storm that was before
shall be over. It has overcome the darkness and the eclipse of the Sun
and the Moon, and shall forthwith be a king over its species, and shall
not lose its dominion in all eternity but shall remain the King of Glory.
<p>Take the Stone, white or red, from the cask in a stone mortar, imbibe
it with a good amount of purified Mercury, which I have taught you to prepare.
Pound them together with a wooden pestle without stopping for a whole day.
After that, put it back in its glass, set it again in the philosophers’
stove or in tripodem, and give it as much fire as is used to keep Saturn
melting. Seal the glass’s mouth and keep it in this heat till all the Mercury
is dead. It will take place in 40 or 50 days, because the Stone draws its
spirit into its nature, for each seeks its like, and all rejoice in their
likes.
<p>When Mercury is dead, raise your fire somewhat till the matter is white.
When it is a white Stone, remove it. Make a copper plate red-hot, put on
it one grain of the Stone and see if the Stone is liquid and has ingress,
so that it can tinge the laminae and go through them like oil through dry
leather, turning the plate white like fine silver. If it does so, it is
ready. If not, imbibe it again with clean Paradise Water, in due form,
as has been taught before. To one ounce of the Stone take 4 Lots of Paradise
Water as has been taught before. To 1 ounce of the Stone take 4 Lots of
Paradise Water each time you pour the Paradise Water on. Continue doing
this till the Stone is liquid and has the ingress you wish. If it is the
red Stone, after you have imbibed it with Paradise Water, keep it standing
in as much heat as is required to keep lead in fusion till it becomes red
again. It will take much longer than with the white Stone. Test it also
just like the white Stone.
<p>But this you have to take note of: If you wish to prepare the Stone
in order to make projection with it on mercury, it must be made as fusible
as wax, and that must be done carefully as the Stone is apt to go through
the glass. My advice is that you should make it flow so much that it becomes
red-hot before melting. This concerns the white Stone. After this, make
projection with it on tin. The red Stone, however, must not be made more
liquid. It must well glow but without blazing, for as the Paradise Water
it contains is dead and fixed, it must stay in the furnace and glow for
40 days before it comes out red. When the redness is outside, you must
raise the fire to keep the Stone glowing constantly. Just enough that you
can see it glow, and no more. Let it stand thus for three days, then let
it cool, and thank God that your Stone is accomplished.
<p>Dear Sons, You must keep to your measures in all your works and especially
when making the Stone fusible, for if you make it too liquid, it will go
through the glass, as has been taught before. You must make the red Stone
even less liquid or you will be unable to infuse it with the tincture of
the Paradise Water. You should know that all things in the world can be
made malleable and fusible with the Paradise Water if it is sublimated
with tem or pressed into them to make it stay with them. This is called
ceratio, and ceratio is nothing but making hard non-fusible things fusible
so that they may have ingress. It was first discovered by the old masters.
For after seeking a long tie how to make the Stone to the White and the
Red, they found that their work was useless as their Stone did not melt
and remained as a powder or earth. Then they realized that they were lacking
noting but ceratio, which would give ingress. They looked in many and varied
things, yet found it in none except sulphur and auripigment, and especially
in mercury.
<p>You should also know that the oil of all things in the world separates
from its earth in the fire, except that of minerals and metals, because
their oil says with the earth in the fire and does not separate from it.
If it does separate, the earth rises together with it, as their oils cannot
be separated from the earth, which can be done with other things. They
knew well that if they wished to follow Nature, they needed such oils to
increate and make their spirit and dry earth liquid. They found them in
sulphur and auripigment, but ten times more in Mercury.
<p>In this way the art of creation was invented. They made their Stone
liquid as they wished, and it did what they desired of their Art. By it
they made fusible whatever they wished, they sublimated the spirits through
hot things and made them strong and poisonous, so that they became so subtle
that it was astonishing. When they had made them thus subtle by subliming
and not with corrosive things, and they had absorbed enough of the tinctures,
they incerated the substance with well purified Mercury, that is, they
poured a large quantity of Mercury over it, put it in tripodem, let it
ascend and descend until the Mercury stayed with it. Thus they made their
spirits fusible as they pleased. They also took Sol and Luna, made into
a very subtle calx, imbibed it with purified Mercury and set it in tripodem,
in a glass as illustrated. They reversed (turned over) it often and sublimated
it till the mercury stayed with it. Thus they made the calx fusible and
could tinge with it, namely, they dissolved the calx in vinegar, turned
it into subtle crystalline stones which they cleaned carefully, ground
them into a powder, imbibed that with fresh Mercury, set it in tripodem,
as has been reported about Sol and Luna, and in this way they also made
a medicine.
<p>I am telling you, dear Sons, the whole Art lies in creation. Therefore
read this over frequently, for it contains great wonders. Consequently,
you will be able to make medicines from all metals, as we have taught and
said, in a short time, without special effort, harm, or expense, and all
with this Art, with the Philosophical Mercury.

<p><b><font size=+1>Another Work of the Old Masters</font></b></center>

<p>There have also been some others who took 3 Lots Silver and 1 Lot Gold.
They melted and filed them together, then put the matter into an iron mortar
and powdered it fine, so that it could be pressed through a cloth. After
that, they rubbed it till it became intangible. Others added to it honey
or gum and rubbed it intangibly. They put this into a glass, poured clean
water on it, boiled it for one hour, let it stand, then poured it off.
Again they poured more water on it, boiled it, let it stand, and poured
it off. They did this till the powder was quite pure and no more blackness
came out of it. Then they dried the powder, took Mercury pressed though
5 or 6 times and washed perfectly clean with salt and vinegar, put it into
a glass, added an alembic, set it in ash with a gentle fire of the kind
used to burn roses. They let it stand in this heat for 10 or 12 days, so
as to draw its superfluous moisture off, which would harm the Work. This
is how every Mercury to be used in the Art must be prepared, but it must
not be heated too much lest the mercury sublimate --- unless it would sublimate
only a little. That would not harm it, but if it would rise too much, you
must revivify it with warm water, adding moisture to it --- otherwise your
would have worked in vain. Therefore take care that the mercury does not
rise, for every live Mercury contains much water, as you will notice in
the receptacle. That must be removed from it if it is to die with Gold
and Silver and turn into a fixed powder. But if it were to retain its moisture,
it would never die completely. Therefore, draw its moisture off as long
as you see moisture appear in the alembic. Then let it stand for 10 days
and watch that it does not sublimate. After this, take it out and preserve
it in a glass or can, in a warm place, well closed to prevent any moisture
from getting into it.
<p>My child must know that all Mercury intended to be used for amalgamating
must be prepared in this way, as otherwise it will not die or will congeal.
This has led many a man astray, so that he did not achieve his purpose
on account of the excess of water contained in Mercury. And thus they remain
mistaken.
<p>You should further know that Sol, Luna, and Mercury must be prepared
in this way to achieve a better conjunction. Weigh your powder of Sol and
Luna, add to it their weight in prepared Mercury, and no more, for if you
take more, your work will have to stand all the longer in the fire. But
if there is no more of one ingredient than of another, the spirit will
die next to the Body and be congealed and brought to its perfect color,
be it for the White or the Red. After that, pour a large amount of Mercury
over it, to increate and liquify the Stone.
<p>On the fixed White Stone you must pour about 10 or 12 parts of Spirit,
and one Red about 20 or 24, even up to 30 parts. For if you take 12 parts
of Spirit to one part of the White, one part of the Red requires at least
30 parts before it becomes fusible, the reason begin that the White Stone
is raw, moist, cold, and white. It therefore does not need half as much
Paradise Water, or Spirit, to increate it as the Red which is hot and dry
in its nature, and before it begins to melt, it requires about 30 parts
of Spirit to one part of Stone. Someone might ask: If we have to pour so
much paradise Water on the white and the red powder before they become
liquid and subtle, they must probably stand a long time in the fire before
the Spirit of both can ripen and die and become fixed with the Stone.
<p>This is so because in their innermost composition both Spirit and Body
were raw, and they must therefore stand longer before they can penetrate
and embrace each other in their depths.
<p>The first amalgamation must be made with such a small fire that little
or nothing can rise in the vessel in which it is contained, It must therefore
stand for a long time before it dies and turns into powder. And when the
Stone to the White and the Red is made, it is fixed and not liquid, and
is yet a medicine at bottom, although it has no ingress yet.
<p>Hermes says: When Mercury is dissolved, it dissolves only a little of
the other metals and spirits, and when it is coagulated, it continues to
coagulate.
<p>And Hermes says further: Even if much Paradise Water is poured over
it, yes, even 30 parts to one part of already coagulated Mercury, it coagulates
this Paradise Water somewhat.
<p>Another reason is the following: Part of the powder is already a medicine,
though it cannot be melted and it therefore turns some of the Paradise
Water into its own nature. Also, if the Paradise water is poured on the
powder and put in the furnace, it may be heated much more than at the beginning
of the Work --- because at the beginning it must not sublimate. Now you
can heat it so that it rises and again falls back on the powder in droplets.
As soon as it begins to die and turn into powder, increase you fire to
make it sublimate, and turn the glass frequently upside down, so that the
matter above falls to the bottom, Continue doing this till everything stays
together below. After that, raise the fire somewhat till it gets its color,
be it to the White or to the Red.
<p>These are the reasons why one has to pour so much Paradise Water on
one part of the powder. It must not stand as long as in the beginning of
the work, this is so that you should rightly understand the Work, know
what is good and what is bad, and not go wrong. Be cautious, therefore,
and know what to do, enclose it in your heart and memory and reflect upon
it before beginning anything that might be harmful to your work.
<p>Now we will do the Work. Take the powder Sol and Luna, weigh it, add
to it as much Philosophical Mercury as above, put it onto an iron mortar,
heat it, but not so much that the Mercury rises, add to it in English weight
of *, well pulverized. Then pound it into an amalgamate with the *, which
absorbs the red powder and the Mercury. Pound it thus ceaselessly for a
whole day, and the next day pound it again ceaselessly for 12 hours, but
block your mouth, nose and ears to that you do not get hurt by it. After
these 12 hours, put your matter in a glass with its mouth tightly closed,
set it in the secret furnace and give it fire in due form, as has been
taught in the Great Work. By regulating the fire, you will accomplish all
the works connected with the amalgamate.
<p>It is all a regimen of the fire, but it is done in various ways. Yet
they all achieve results --- but each is seeking to shorten the time. There
have been some others who took the Stone which God has given us for nothing.
They sublimated and purified it of all its faeces three or four times,
the coagulated it again into a white powder and preserved it in a little
box till they needed it. The Stone was ready. Now they took the prepared
Mercury, sublimated it with vitriol, mixed one lb of Mercury and 3 lb of
vitriol and elevated it. After this, they again ground the Mercury among
the faces and sublimated it again.
<p>The third time, they took 2 lb of fresh vitriol --- throwing away the
other faeces --- sublimed it again, and put it in a tightly closed box.
Then they took 15 oz Luna and 5 oz Sol, melted them together, filed it
small and pounded it in a mortar. After this, the powder was washed clean,
dried again and also preserved in a box. Now they took 8 Lots of the Stone
which God has given us for nothing, 4 Lots of the gold and silver powder,
and as much sublimated Mercury as their combined weight, to make it 24
Lots all together. They mixed all this and pounded it on a stone till it
became intangible, dried it on hot ashes, put it into a round glass thus
formed (see the drawing), and filled it to the brim. They hung it in tripodem
in the innermost room, closed it and let it hang for 84 days, and they
gave it only so much fire that they could easily put their hand in it without
getting burnt. They did this by means of a lamp. When the 84 days were
over, they took the glass from the stove, broke it and removed the mater.
They then heated a copper plate, put the matter on it and set it in a blacksmith’s
furnace. They watched to see if the matter was smoking and if it had lost
any weight, or they put half a Lot into a crucible, let it become red-hot
for a quarter of an hour, then weighed it again to see if they had lost
some. If they noticed a loss, they put the matter once more into a glass,
and in tripodem, gave it a somewhat stronger fire than before --- so that
one could hardly put one’s hand in it --- and let it stand for another
30 or 40 days. Then they removed the glass and looked if the matter was
fixed. And without it, it will be fixed and red like blood, and will not
flow.
<p>Now they took the matter and mixed it with 2 parts of the philosophical
Paradise Water in a hot mortar, and ground it for 12 hours without stopping.
Then they put it in such a glass as is illustrated here, closed with strong
lute, put it on the furnace and let it rise and fall till everything was
turned into powder. They continued doing this till everything was fixed
together and stayed at the bottom. This done, they left it there at the
same regimen of the fire till the white color appeared. When it was white,
they had the White Elixir; but if they whished to have the Red Elixir,
they let it stand and increased the fire, as with the regimen of the fire
to the White the redness does not emerge, as mentioned before. That is
why we must understand and remember everything very well if we wish to
be perfect and act perfectly in the Art and produce something useful. Therefore
do not begrudge reading this over frequently in order to understand. When
then the redness appears, you have accomplished the Red Elixir for the
transmutation of all imperfect metals into genuine gold, better than the
natural one. It can stand all tests and examinations.
<p>In addition, you should know that everything I shall report and teach
about this Work is to be understood as concerning the Great Work (the Magnum
Opus) of which the philosophers have written in covert words. First, there
is the reduction of the Body to its first nature: They amalgamated the
perfect Body, that is Luna (because it is fixed) and this is the solution
of the old masters. Their dissolution is not achieved by pouring rain water
on the Body but a very dry Water, which is Mercury. This is the foundation
of the Art of which Rhasis says: Unless you dissolve the Body, you work
in vain.
<p>Of this dissolution Geber says in his <i>Liber Veritatis</i> in the
<i>Turba</i>:
The surest way lies in the art of reduction, that is, the dissolution of
the Bodies into a clear beautiful water out of which they were first generated.
In this water the Spirit, Soul and Body are contained.
<p>Geber says further: When they turned the Bodies into mercury in such
a way that they could pass through a cloth, they said, Now we have an Element
of Fire.
<p>Further, he says that the earth is made out of the coarseness of the
water, and that they said: We have also the other Elements, Fire and Earth.
<p>The third work is purification, of which Morienus says: The earth is
rotten because of the water, and it has to be purified. Then, with God’s
help, the whole magistrery has been accomplished.
<p>The <i>Turba Philosophorum</i> says: Moisten the dry with the wet, because
the dry is the earth and the wet is the water; see now, we have purified
the water and the earth.
<p>The fourth work is the evaporation of the water. When the Water of Paradise
rises to heaven and falls down again to the earth in droplets, they call
it sublimation. By rising and falling it turns into powder, and they call
this rising Air. Thus you have Water, Air and Earth, and that is as the
philosophers say: When it has become white, pour Paradise Water over it
and let it sublimate until it turns into a spirit called Bird of Hermes.
Morienus says of it: Do not despise the ashes, for you will find at the
bottom a shining ash, and in it you will find a precious adamant.
<p>After this they say: Add to it the Ferment Aleph.
<p>To turn it into a white powder, it must be imbibed with Paradise Water
in which fine gold should be amalgamated. They call this imbibing, fermenting.
Further, the philosophers say: Moisten the body with the soul.
<p>Therefore we add the soul to the Stone, for just as a man’s body is
not without a soul, our Stone is not without a soul and life. The soul
purifies the imperfect body because it adds the ferment to nature. That
is why they add a ferment when the fold is mingled with the Paradise Water.
It is as Morienus says: Unless you purify and whiten the powders perfectly,
then infuse the soul into them and unite it with the powders, you have
not done anything toward your magistery.
<p>That is why the philosopher Bautin says: Join the soul to the body and
the spirit.
<p>Then the spirit will be added and they will rejoice together, for they
have been transformed from their nature --- a coarse thing --- and have
now become subtle. It is this of which the philosophers say in the <i>Codex
Veritatis</i>: The spirits are not combined with the body until they are
completely rid of their impurity.
<p>In this conjunction there are wonderful things, because all the colors
of the world, as many as you can think of, are contained in it, and finally
all merge into one color, which is the red. Then the body is colored by
the ferment, which is the soul, and the spirit with the soul are joined
to the body and is again converted with it into the colors of the ferment,
so that the fire can no loner separate it, no matter how strong it may
be.
<p>From what I have told you, you can understand that the philosophers
spoke the truth: Our Stone is composed of body soul, and spirit.
<p>They considered the perfect body a dead body, because Luna is sick and
not fixed. They say that the spirit is a running, glistening water, and
they call the sol the ferment. They speak of the truth, for it gives life
to the body, which it did not have before, and gives it a better form.
And thus everything they have written in covert words is true.
<p>In addition, some philosophers say: Unless you make the corporeal incorporeal,
and the incorporeal corporeal, you have done nothing in our Art.
<p>When it is amalgamated, we first make water of the body, then the body
is disembodied. By constant decoction it becomes drunk and dies with the
spirit --- then the spirit turns into a body.
<p>The old masters say: Follow Nature, and you will find what you are looking
for.
<p>It is true, for in our Work we first make the moist dry, or the coarse
subtle, then the subtle coarse, a spirit out of the body, and a body out
of the spirit. Of the uppermost we make the lowest, and of the lowest the
uppermost. Thus they transform one nature into another, just as it is supposed
to be.
<p>That the old masters described this in such obscure words, however,
is because of the unwise who are not Sons of the Art, so that they should
not understand it, as it is meant to be a secret.
<p>It is also the reason why they wrote so many chapters, to make the unintelligent
believe that our Art is so difficult. In every chapter they wrote about
foreign things, including many foreign names, such as reductio, solutio,
ablutio, sublimatio, destillatio, coagulatio, calcinations, fixation, and
various other names and manipulations, as I said before.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Observe Now How the Ancients Found Such Terms in the
Work</font></b></center>

<p>If you wish to make a Work as the old masters, our forefathers, did,
take Mercury that comes out of the earth where they dig for old or silver,
and not artificially manufactured quicksilver. Press it through leather,
and if something is left in the leather, see what body it is. Melt it in
a crucible with borax and you will see with what kind of metal it is mixed.
If it is an imperfect metal, the Mercury is of no use for our Work, but
if you find Gold or Silver, it is good. If you do not find any body at
all, it is also good.
<p>Take as much of this Mercury as you like. Put it in a glass vessel,
an alembic on top, and draw the superfluous moisture from it, as it would
be harmful in your Work. After this, take the perfect body, well refined
of led in the cupel, and amalgamate it with a large amount of Mercury.
The old masters always took 3 parts of silver and 1 part of gold. They
called it the Ferment. Some of the old ones amalgamated gold and silver
together, as has been taught before.
<p>Others, however, amalgamated only gold with the Paradise Water and finally
poured it on the powder; to the ferment, as will be described later. When
they amalgamated silver, they put it in a glass (as illustrated) in tripodem,
in all whiteness, as was taught in the previous chapter, and with the same
regimen of the fire. In this way they also amalgated gold and put it in
a glass in tripodem, like silver. The Paradise Water came from Mercury
whose moisture had been drawn off. Hey put the latter likewise in a glass
and set it in tripodem to the other two glasses till the Work had incerated.
They did this so that it would more easily incerate and stick to the Work,
because it becomes half-fixed, having been decocted for so long. But it
has not yet turned into powder, and even if it were to stand in the furnace
for 10 years, it would not die.
<p>That is why Mercurius says: If as much of myself as a fish-eye were
alive, I would not be dead.
<p>The reason is that no body has been mixed with it; neither father nor
mother nor someone of its species has been added to it in the amalgamation.
This you should understand as follows: If a metal or a metallic Spirit
is intermixed with Mercury or some of our White or Red Stone --- which
are of its species --- it will die at once, but it will never die alone
by itself.
<p>Dear children, Read this lesson over often, so that you may learn to
know the nature of all things --- and let this be said enough.
<p>Now we will return to our Work, which we had left. All three glasses
are standing in tripode, in the innermost chamber --- which is to be carefully
sealed to prevent any air from escaping --- and are governed by a fire
so small that you can put your hand in it for half an hour without burning.
Now the old masters wondered how they could give a special sign for each
sign they saw in the Work, so that the fools who were no Sons of the Art
would not understand it. Therefore they gave so many names and wrote about
so many different manipulations to make it appear all too difficult, such
as solutio, inceratio, and various other labors. And all this only because
of the ignorant who are not children of the Art and are not to possess
the heritage of the wise.
<p>This whole operation takes place in a closed glass, with the Work standing
in the furnace. The fools learn that each operation is a special work,
to be prepared in special glasses and with special instruments, with strange
oils and a difficult regimen of the fire. They consider it difficult and
cannot understand that everything can be accomplished in one closed vessel,
in one furnace, and with one regimen of the fire.
<p>First, the old masters saw that the matter or the Stone developed a
black skin or blackness. They wondered how they should call it and decided
to call it a blackening of the sea or the lake, as the water was all black
above. And as Sol and Luna were in it, they called it the Solar and Lunar
Eclipse --- and the fools did not understand it.
<p>Secondly, they saw that the water --- which is Mercury --- was rising
above in the glass out of the matter and the body of Sol and Luna. Then
they said: The wind carried it in its belly --- because it rises out of
the warmth of the matter.
<p>Therefore, a philosopher says: You must add it to the Air, in whose
belly it is to be carried through the action of the sun, which is its father.
After that, give it to drink Aleph when it falls down again to the bottom
or on the matter, for it is to be imbibed with the moisture of the earth
which is its nurse.
<p>Regarding this, Hermes, a father of the philosophers, says as follows:
What is above is like what is below, and what is below, is like what is
above.
<p>Dandin says:&nbsp; Whoever wishes to perform miracles with a thing of
which our Stone is the father and the earth is the sister, and Luna the
mother, and the wind carries it in its belly, and its nurse is the earth…
<p>Further says the same philosopher: It rises from the earth to heaven,
and from heaven back to the earth, and it shall get power from what is
above and what is below.
<p>He speaks the truth, for when it begins to hang above in drops and those
fall back on the earth, it dies and turns into a powder. When it is such,
you must pour Paradise Water over it and then present Luna, which is now
its nourishment, and heat it till your thing is completed. Now it is more
precious than anything in the world. But the ignorant cannot understand
it. When the old masters saw that it continued rising and falling in the
glass, they reflected and found no other name for this than Sublimate,
because it is a true sublimation.
<p>Therefore Geber says in the Turba: When the Stone or the Work is conjoined,
it is ready for sublimation…
<p>The fools did not understand that the sublimation takes place in a closed
glass, and they erred.
<p>Further, they noticed that the droplets fell down and remained as water,
and they called this Distillation. That is why Morienus says in the Buch
der Scharen: After the sublimation follows the distillation.
<p>Finally, the matter is transformed into earth, and the earth stays on
the water. It happens as follows: When Mercury rose, it moved out of the
matter or the earth, and when it fell down, it did no mingle again with
the body and slowly turned into earth. At last they noticed that the earth
again began to sink below the water to the bottom of the vessel, and in
so doing it turned black. They thought they would call it the Corruption
and the Fetid monster. Of this Morienus says in his books: Our Stone is
found in a rotten corrupted monster, that is where our Stone is gathered.
<p>From this some concluded that the Stone should be sought in stables,
troughs, dirt, manure. They were mistaken, because they are not or children.
<p>After this, they saw this evil-smelling earth die by means of constant
coction and a good regimen of the fire. The water lost its stench and changed
colors. The philosophers call this the Ablution. That is why Morienus says:
Wash the original matter and purify the evil-smelling substance with the
water. That is why they calcined it with salt, pounded it on a stone, washed
it with pure water, and did this till the water ran off quite pure. And
they were as far ahead with their Work as when they began, and lost money,
effort, and labor.
<p>Hermes and Geber say: Know that our Art is nothing but a drawing of
the water out of the earth and a pouring of the water back on it, till
they are both washed and mixed together.
<p>The ignorant do not know that this must be done in a closed vessel,
in our furnace, because they are not our children.
<p>After this, they saw this evil-smelling earth die by means of constant
coction and a good regimen of the fire. The water lost its stench and changed
colours. The philosophers call this the Ablution. That is why Morienus
says: Wash the original matter and purify the evil-smelling substance with
the water. Then a conjunction may occur between body, soul, and spirit
--- and the ignorant thought that the body had to be washed with common
water. That is why they calcined it with salt, pounded it on a stone, washed
it with pure water, and did all this till the water ran off quite pure.
And they were as far ahead with their Work as when they began, and lost
money, effort, and labor.
<p>Hermes and Geber say: Know that our Art s nothing but a drawing of the
water our of the earth and mixed together.
<p>The ignorant do not understand this and stick to their fantasies. They
do not know that this must be done in a closed glass, in our furnace, because
they are not our children.
<p>Then, after a long decoction and regimen of the fire, the philosophers
saw that the earth grew and became coarser, thereafter smaller, due to
the tempered heat. Now they all said, It is a perfect inceration.
<p>That was its proper name, and therefore Dandin the Philosopher says:
One should extract its strength and imbibe it again.
<p>Hermes says: The earth is to be imbibed with the water.
<p>Morienus: Give to drink to the thirsty till it has enough juice, and
it will no more be thirsty in all eternity.
<p>The ignorant do not understand that it all takes pace in a closed glass
by a long decoction and tempered heat.
<p>Then they noticed that all the water was dry and had turned into earth.
Geber
says: When our earth is made, our magistery is accomplished for the most
part.
<p>They saw the matter turn into a thick, hard substance, and when it stood
firm and did no longer rise, they said: This is a perfect coagulation,
made of its own matter.
<p>Hermes says: Dissolve our Stone and coagulate it very carefully, turn
it into earth, and thereafter make it white, then alive, and finally red
--- and you have the magistery.
<p>Dandin says: Know that our Stone is nothing but a perfect dissolving
and again coagulating without a change of its substance, without taking
anything away from it or adding anything to it. Till you have done everything,
shun all books and do not seek anything else.
<p>Morienus says: Our work is nothing but a woman’s work and children’s
play.
<p>Stupid men cannot understand it and do not know how the secret words
are to be understood, but if they were our children, they would understand
and know everything clearly.
<p>Further, they saw that by a long decoction and tempered hat the earth
became increasingly white, and finally they saw it became completely brilliant,
and its whiteness surpassed all the whiteness in the world. They called
this whitening Calcination, and it is truly the right calcinations of the
forefathers and the right name.
<p>That is why Hermes and Morienus say: Do not despise the ash that lies
at the bottom, for in it is a precious adamant and a maid who will be surrounded
by fruit and bring forth a Son of Life.
<p>When now the ferment is mixed with the white earth, the imperfect body
or earth receives the ferment, and then is accomplished what one intended
to do. This is what the old philosophers mean when they say: Feed the child
with its own milk till it is grown up.
<p>It means that the white earth should be incerated with the ferment and
the Paradise Water. As this matter was white and fixed, they removed it
from the furnace together with the other glass containing the gold amalgamate,
pounded them together in a stone mortar with a steel pestle to mix them
well, and in this way they fermented. Concerning this, Morienus says: Conjoin
and add its soul to it, so that it may not part from the body in all eternity.
<p>Geber says: Arrange a marriage and put the bride to bed with her bridegroom,
and imbibe both with the dew of heaven, and the bride will conceive a son
who will be kin over all his line, and all his enemies will make peace
with him, and he will be crowned with a red diadem.
<p>After this, they took the matter and put it back into the glass, took
the Paradise Water and imbibed the matter with 10 parts of Paradise Water
to 1 part of matter, and that is as Geber says: Moisten the bed with heavenly
dew, and the bride will conceive a son.
<p>Thereafter they sealed the glass, put it back into the furnace and increased
the fire somewhat till the Paradise Water sublimated and fell back in the
earth in drops. That was the Son who makes everything brilliant and who
is to be fed with his own milk till he is grown up.
<p>My child, You should know and well understand that if you wish to make
the red Ston, you must bring the white earth to redness by its ferment
and by increasing the fire till the earth turns yellow. When it is perfectly
yellow, like a crocus, the Element Air comes out. With the regimen of the
fire which drives out and moves the Air, the fire cannot brig out the red
tincture, unless it be greatly increased till the matter turns red. When
it is red, imbibe it wit Paradise Water till it has absorbed it all and
has turned into a powder. Now regulate the fire till the powder becomes
white once more, like snow; then increase the fire till it becomes yellow
again, and every more till the matter becomes red --- and now your Work
is ready and accomplished.
<p>In this Work you have all four Elements, each separately. First you
have seen Water and earth. They appeared first, and the Air was removed
from them, which you also saw later in the yellowness. Now you see the
Fire in its redness, because it is now on the outside.
<p>The old masters spoke the truth, saying that our Stone is made of four
Elements. Neverthelesss, it was no more than one, and made of one thing,
and they spoke the truth. But if you only want the White Stone, give it
Paradise Water, just as you did with the ferment, let it ascend and descend
till it stays at the bottom, keep up the regimen of the fire till the powder
again becomes perfectly white, and you have the perfect white Stone for
the transmutation of all imperfect bodies into true silver. Consequently,
my child should know that all these methods of operation are good, and
their projection so high as to amaze you, and you will discover it yourself.
<p>If you throw your good medicine on a metal or on mercury, as long as
the medicine retains its power, the metal is frangible like glass that
can be pulverized. If you now throw some of this powder on another metal,
it is still a medicine, and in this way it should always be thrown on other
metals, as much as the projection allows, be it on gold or on silver, according
to how the medicine is prepared.
<p>Thereafter they sealed the glass, put it back into the furnace and increased
the fire somewhat till the Paradise Water sublimated and fell back on the
earth in drops. That was the Son who makes everything brilliant and who
is to be fed with his own milk till he is grown up.

<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Multiplication of the Stone</font></b></center>

<p>Now I will teach you how you should multiply the Stone. You must not
make the Stone more than once in your life, after which you may make of
it as much as you wish, even in the hundred pounds and more.
<p>Take 10 or 12 lb Mercury, sublimate it through Roman Vitriol, 3 parts
of vitriol to 1 part of Mercury. When the Mercury is ready, preserve it
till you need it. Then take 1 oz of fine gold, cement it in the regal,
and make it in the crucible. Throw into it 1 oz of your medicine, let it
melt a little, about the time it takes to say two Pater Nosters. Then it
is a mass, which take out, pound into a subtle powder, and grind on a stone
with rectified vinegar. This is done so that the powder may dry somewhat
on a small fire, because wine flies away as soon as it feels the heat.
Now take the powder, add to it its weight in mercury, mix them well together,
quite dry, on stone, then grind it with rectified vinegar. Dry it in the
sun or in a room to remove all moisture, put it in a glass as illustrated,
pour on it 12 parts of mercury, close the glass tightly, shake it by hand
to mix the mercury and the powder, set it in tripodem, give it fire as
has been taught, and immediately as hot as it was when you poured on the
Paradise Water, and let it stand for 40 days.
<p>Then it will all be a medicine, and it is as good and better than it
was before. If you wish to make more medicine, take a large glass, weigh
10 oz of your Medicine and add 100 oz of mercury, prepared as above, that
is, of which the moisture has been removed. Mix well, set it in tripodem
for 40 days with the above regimen of the fire, and it will all turn into
medicine as good as the first. Thus you can multiply your medicine ad infinitum
in a short time, and it is always as good as the first.
<p>Further my child should know that there were some who took 9 parts of
prepared Paradise Water and 1 part of the Stone. They put it into 9 phials
well sealed and set it in tripodem in the innermost chamber till the Stone
was ready and the Paradise Water had to be poured on it. After this, they
took one phial out and poured it into the Paradise Water, mixed well, stoppered
it well with lute and set it again in its place. They let the other 8 parts
stand where they were till part of the Stone had become fixed. Thus they
did with all 9 glasses till all imbibed their portion of Paradise Water
and had thereby become fixed. This seems to me to be the best method as
it shortens the Work and is easy to do because it is not as overloaded
as if everything were put together in one glass. True, it requires somewhat
more work but it better to pour on these 9 parts than on one part of the
Stone, and that is what the old masters did and what they taught their
children. Hear and understand these words, for they spoke thus: Take 9
parts of May Dew, each sealed in a phial and keep in the tripod in even
heat till the lowest part becomes white and dry, then imbibe the lowest
with p. 1 part 6 parts of May Dew, and then with the other part, till it
flows like oil.
<p>You must know that the old alchemists made the Stone in many different
ways, and at the end it was always good. Know that the old masters worked
as I have told you. But their descendants discovered many other forms of
the works by which they could shorten the Art, such as using aquafort,
as is being taught in the Mineral Work at many different places. Likewise
in the Animal Work and even much more so in the Vegetable Work, which are
all full of wonders, and strange waters which seem to be miraculous, as
is being taught at many places in the Vegetable Work. They also discovered
how to separate the Elements in various ways, as is also taught in the
Work at many places, and it has to be done with great subtility and care.
They also sought to shorten the time and to try doing it according to Nature.
The Work involves great worry, much labor and much expense and uncertainty.
Therefore I advise you, my dear children, avoid all works requiring the
separation of the Elements or many ways of making AF, as I have taught
in the preface and will teach later.
<p>We have taught how our forefathers dealt with the amalgamate, and as
they all reached a sure conclusion, the product was of such a goodness,
it could not be improved upon.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now I Will Teach You How To Make The Stone From Putrefied
Water As Well As How To Make The Olea of Metals.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>This Can Be Done With Little Effort And Without Separation
Of The Elements.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>You Will Also Learn The Method Of Bringing Them To
Such A Perfection As Is Certain And Good.</font></b></center>

<p>The reason why the Elements are separated is that the Imperfectum be
made perfect; also that the impurities be separated, and that the corpus
and spirit be this rid of all impurity, and be afterwards conjoined. Know
then, that anything that reaches the fire, no matter how impure it is,
is made clean and pure by the fire, as we have taught before. The first
sign is a perfect blackness, and we see it with out eyes. All matter becomes
as black as pitch. Why? The fire drives Corruption, or what is rotten,
upwards and it leaves the matter because of the strength of the heat. This
is not done, however, with a strong but with a gentle fire. Then the Corruption
of Faces which in the Arca are driven above until everything is black.
<p>That is why Morienus says: Take care that you regulate your fire in
such a way that you do not obtain whiteness before blackness, the albedo
before the nigredo, or all your work is spoiled by the whiteness if it
occurs before the blackness.
<p>So it must be a sure method that will drive the Corruption out by fire,
and thus must be the purification and Perfection. Be careful in our work
for after long and steady boiling the heat consumes the Corruption, faeces
and blackness, and changes it into another color, and ever another until
it is perfectly white like snow. And it is done gently, so that the elements
are not forced, but are gently rectified of their impurities. Take care,
however, in every respect, as Morienus has warned, tat you do not get the
redness before the whiteness; for our Stone must not be burnt in this work.
Know that this is the best way; for it is often necessary to give strong
heat where the separation of the elements must be accomplished, before
the elementum ignis is brought over, and everything must glow.
<p>After this, if you wish to calcine the faeces the matter has to be burnt
in the reverberating furnace. Often the matte turns white; then it has
to be changed into glass, and thus one thing is spoilt with the other.
But, in the Great Work, there is no uncertainty. The faeces know how to
consume themselves of themselves, as Geber says: The dragon must devour
its own blackness, and it has to be fed with its own venom. Dantin says:
The black crow must hatch its own eggs with its young, till they all turn
white For that is the art and nature of all things under the sky, that
they desire to rectify themselves out of an inherent impulse and to rid
themselves of their faeces which are superfluous to them, and to be without
defect. For they were perfect and without defects from the beginning. The
four Elementa, and everything made from them, mobile and immobile, nothing
excepted, are all perfect in the beginning and in the end, and all things
desire to be rid of the faeces.
<p>Someone might ask: But what are the faeces? It is a humor or moisture
which God has ordered, and everything under the course of heaven must be
nourished by it. It keeps all things in its nature and is in all things
a perfect, elementary, natural warmth or fire, and if the perfect fire
does not meet with unfortunate accidents, it will keep the thing in its
nature. But as soon as a bad accident happens to the fire, which is also
hot and imperfect, and one thing mingles with another, they all become
hot and harm and destroy the thing, be it in metals, animas, trees or herbs,
and in all things under the sky.
<p>There two kinds of water in all things created out of the Elements,
a natural one and an elementary one, and that is perfect, good and eternal.
Then there is still another water. It is called the Water of the Clouds.
That is imperfect, and is mixed with the elementary water. It is meant
to give nourishment and moisture to things and to keep them in their nature
as long as no other extraneous water is added to them. But if more is added,
it will drown the thing, so that it dies and corrupts, just as when water
is poured into fire.
<p>Similarly, you must understand this in regard to air and earth. If there
were no faeces in the elements, all things would be perfect, spiritual
and subtle, as God meant them to be. Nor would there be decaying and death,
as is explained about faeces and diseases of the elements in the Vegetablili.
Find it in Chapter 16.
<p>Now you might ask, however; if a thing is destroyed in such a way, where
then is the perfection which it contains?&nbsp; Read about that in the
Vegetabili, Chapter 29. You will also find explained there how one thing
attracts its like. Know also that, if a thing has died, be it sensitive
or insensitive, the spirit of its corpus separates from it and joins its
like, from which it has originated, as you will understand by the Vegetabili.
Look at the flame of fire or coal; the flames heat, the smoke moves upward.
In this smoke is hidden the spirit of air. It joins its like. The same
applies to the other elements.
<p>But now someone may ask: Where then do the faeces elementorum stay,
when each thing has gone to its own? Concerning this, consider this example:
If you put a glass vessel containing water into the sun the sun draws the
water to itself, and stinking black dregs will stay behind. Let it stand
in the glass protected from rain and wind, for a long time, and the slimy
black matter will in time become white as snow and is smell will disappear.
Such is the effect of the nature of the sun. Another example: Take a glass
basin full of green herbs; put it in the sun or exposed to the air. The
herbs will begin to decay and smell bad, and, each element draws towards
its like as mentioned before. The black stinking earth stays in the basin,
but after a long time the air and the warmth of the sun will calcine it
as white as snow, And this is the work of nature.
<p>Another example: Take the corpse of an evildoer, who lies on the rack
or hangs on the gallows. The air and the sun consume its stench and decay,
so that nothing remains but white ashes. In time the hard legs, which were
full of fat and marrow, are thus consumed, so that they turn into white,
fine salt which is intangible between the fingers. That is brought about
by nature, as we may see every day with our own eyes. Where then remains
the stinking matter? It passes away and turns into nothing, and the element
earth is thus cleansed and white as snow, so that it becomes impalpable.
Thus it is evident in our Art one must not separate any elements, nor does
one require any washing or purification.
<p>That is has to be tested to ascertain that it is good and penetrating
I have related to you so that you should understand that the separationes
elementorum are not necessary in our work. Neither is rectification, because
the faeces consume themselves, as indicated: but in the separations elementorum,
a little is always lost in the fire, for they stand in the fire. And just
as it easily loses something, so it is to the detriment of the work, which
you need not be afraid of in this instance, because in the Great Work no
element is separated.
<p>In addition, you should also know that one can make oil from all metals
also without separation of the elements, and without much washing and dissolving.
Yet, it must be done with Aqua Fortis, and you must give it a ferment,
if you wish to make them from a perfect metal. But I advise you not to
make oil from any imperfect metal, except from lead and tin, one for the
Red, the other for the White. There exist many different matters, from
which to make oil. They have been discovered due to the rapidity in which
they can be made, while some did not have the patience to endure the long
amount of time required to accomplish the great Work and because they seek
small gain. Yet in such things there is great danger, more than in the
Great work, also greater labor and handicraft. You must distill AF, and
you must also sublimate and be well acquainted with many unusual types
of work. It also requires a great deal of money, effort, and cost.

<p><b><font size=+1>Olea Ex Aquis Fortibus et Metallis</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>( An Oil from Aquafort and Luna )</font></b></center>

<p>There were some who made an Aqua Fort from Vitriol and Sol. In it they
dissolved fine Luna one part, of the cupel. After that, they ground it
and washed the calx off with common water; then they dried it in the sun
or with fire. Afterward, they put this calx into two glasses, poured rectified
vinegar upon it, each time 1 lb of vinegar upon 1 ounce of calx lunae.
They put one of the glasses in the balneum and the other in front of it.
Then they distilled the vinegar from one Luna onto the other, alternating
the glasses; one into the balneum, the other one, which had been standing
before it, out. Then they distilled once more, and did this until the Luna
was fully dissolved.
<p>When the Luna is totally dissolved, the Aqua Vitae has to be drawn off
in the balneum with gentle heat, such that one can suffer one’s hand to
be in this heat. When a skin forms on the Luna, the process must be stopped,
allow it to cool down and put into a cold cellar to crystallize. Take out
the crystals formed and put them in a small retort, lute it well and set
it in warm ashes in tripodem, or let it stand until the clear little stones
have been transformed into oil with it ad album.

<p><b><font size=+1>Another Kind of Oil Made from Aquafort and Luna</font></b></center>

<p>There have been also others who took 1 oz of Luna amalgamated with prepared
Mercury, in such a way that the amalgamation could be pressed through a
linen cloth. After that, they set it for 6 weeks in moderate heat; and
they dissolved it in an AF made of Vitriol and Salt; drew off again gently
in the balneum. Then they removed it, stoppered it well, set it in cinerum
or tripodem and gave it heat as if one wished to keep Lead in flux. They
kept it thus until the oil was fixed, and tested it in the following way:
They took a sheet of Copper and heated it to glowing, then poured one drop
of this oil upon it. If the oil goes through without smoke, like oil through
leather, and if it tinges to Silver, it is fixed, good and a perfect elixir.
But if it does not do that, put it back in tripodem until it is fixed and
transmutes Mercury, Tin and Copper into true Silver, which passes all tests.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>An Oil Made from Aquafort and Jupiter</font></b></center>

<p>Take 1 lb if Roman Vitriol, 5 lb of auripigment sublimated to the White,
1 lb of Mercury sublimated to the White, calx of tin, 1 lb of (+) ad pondus
omnium. Mix them well together with vinegar, like a paint, then dry the
matter in the sun. Now divide the matter into 3 parts, of one part of which
prepare an AF. Pour it thereafter on the second part and distill it again
with a strong fire. Finally you must pulverize all three death’s heads,
put the substance in a glass, pour the AF on it, lute an alembic and a
receptacle in front and let it stand thus in ash for 8 days before you
give fire, to allow the water to incorporate well with the earth. Now light
the fire and keep it going slowly for 24 hours. Thereafter increase it
from degree to degree, as you well know, so that it slowly becomes red-hot
after 24 hours. Let it stand thus for another 24 hours, then give it as
strong a fire as it can stand, for 3 days and nights. Even if the glass
were to break, it would not matter. Then let it go down, remove the water
and preserve it well sealed, because it is a precious water, better than
gold.
<p>Take the Death’s Head, grind it to a powder and pound it quite finely
on a stone with distilled vinegar. Put it in a stone jar, pour on it a
good amount of distilled vinegar and set it in the Balneum for 8 days,
stirring it well with a wooden spoon every day. Then stopper it again.
Finally, let it settle, pour what is above off into another vessel, put
an alembic on it and distill the vinegar to complete dryness. A white earth
will be left behind. Dissolve it again in vinegar, put it again in a boiling
Balneum and let it dissolve and evaporate once more. Continue doing this
till there are no more faces, and your salt will be more beautiful than
snow. Keep it till you need it.
<p>Now take 1 lb of copper and 1 oz of silver, some prepared gem salt,
which I have taught to prepare at other places. Take also mercury and auripigment,
of each 1 oz, and as much salt as you have of the salt which I asked you
to prepare from the water.&nbsp; Mix everything and pound it quite impalpably
on a stone with vinegar. Then put it in a glass dish, dry it in a room
or in the sun, and when it is quite dry, pound it again on a stone. Then
put it in a retort, lute an alembic on it that has a hole on top, set it
in a Balneum, put a receptacle in front, and give it as much fire that
you could hold your hand in the Balneum. Pour your aqua fortis on the matter
through a funnel. Slowly distill the water off, and when nothing comes
over any more, let it cool, pour some water on it, draw it off again, and
do this till nothing of the water goes over any longer. Then remove the
alembic, put it in ash or in the tripod, the glass closed with a good lute,
let it stand for 6 weeks, and give it so much fire that you could hardly
hold your hand in the furnace for the duration of one Pater Noster. At
the end of 6 weeks, test it on a copper foil. If it passes through without
smoke and tinges it into silver, it is a perfect Elixir. But if it des
not do so, put it back in the tripod as before until it passes the test.
Then you have a perfect oil for transmuting the imperfect metals into silver.
Its projection is one part to 1000 parts, because it is a very powerful
oil. I have seen it do wonders, and consider this oil a minor medicine.

<p><b><font size=+1>A Recipe (For a Projective Powder)</font></b></center>

<p>Found in a casket walled in a wall, sold for much money. It is genuine
and quite expert, as those will easily recognize who are experiences in
alchemy and learned in the process. Therefore, take care not to reveal
this secret to the greedy and ostentatious or to those who are not children
of the Philosophy. Begin as follows:
<p>Take, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, as much gold as you like,
make an amalgam with one part of mercury, evaporate the mercury with a
small fire, then reverbarate it for 20 days and nights, grind it very small,
pour good distilled rectified vinegar, 4 fingers breadth, over the material.
Stopper the cucurbit carefully and set it on hot ashes for 2 days and nights.
Thereafter the vinegar will take on a red color from the gold, Reverbarate
it again for 9 days as before, each time reverberating less, and each tine
pouring carefully the colored vinegar together. Do this till all your gold
is resolved into a grey powder, which is no good for anything. I did this
also, but I took aquafortis, so as to dissolve it the more easily.
<p>Distill the solution, and you will find your gold salt at the bottom.
Reverbarate it for 12 hours (as the recipe demands), which I did, but I
regretted it, because the spirit left by more than half. If I had known
this, I could have obtained and caught the spirit.
<p>Aftr this, dissolve the gold in rectified aqua vitae, let it stand,
as has been said about the vinegar. What is not dissolved, reverbarate
for 3 days and 3 nights, and when all your gold is dissolved in the aqua
vitae, pour the solutions together, distill the aqua vitae off, and you
will find a beautiful salt at the bottom, which dissolves immediately just
as the salt *. Of this salt take 1 part to 4 parts, put some live coal
on it and under it, and in half an hour you will find mercury calcined
to a powder. But I did not succeed in this. What hindered me was (I believe)
the salt, because the spiritus, as I said, had escaped in the reverbaration
during the 12 preceding hours.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>This Work Cost 800 Guilders</font></b></center>

<p>O child of the Doctrine! First seek the kingdom of God, obedience to
the Supreme according to the Word of God, your mind turned to the poor.
Use this philosophical Work in this way, according to the canons or rules
of Chymia, under the influence of nature, and rejoice in the Lord God.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Another Recipe</font></b></center>

<p>First, draw off its moisture and also wash it carefully and cleanly,
sublimate it by itself without any addition, as long as something rises.
Discard what is left over. Now sublimate it 6 or 7 times with as much quite
clean and prepared common salt, put it on a glass plate in a damp cellar
to dissolve it. Pour the dissolved matter back on it till everything is
dissolved, or enclose it in a glass. Sublimate again with prepared salt
what does not dissolve, and you have the Water of the Philosophical Mercury.
Take as much of that as you like, and as much red, clean and pure Laton
as it will absorb. Then put it in a closed urn and keep it for many days.
You will see the Raven’s Head in a short time, which will soon have white
blossoms, then yellow, and finally red ones.
<p>If you will be obedient to God, I will teach you how to make the Stone
from two luminaries (as the old alchemists and their successors themselves
made with their hands), without covert words, including the manipulation
and its powers, its nature and first essence or substance. For one cannot
deprive it of is effect, which nature has put into it or God in his outermost
work, and it is done solely in these two lights.
<p>Even if the two lights were lying till Doomsday in the chaos out of
which they have come, Nature could not effect this with them, because Nature
had infused her outermost power into them. That is why we will immediately
bring these two lights out of their nature, a bad nature and form, into
a better one. Therefore we must go backwards and separate what was together,
what Nature had done, and bring it back into the form it was when Nature
first began to act. To bring it into such a form, we must, as far as possible,
follow Nature with the Art. Sometimes we must go beyond Nature by separating,
rectifying, coagulating, purifying, combining, and incerating the earth,
and undertake many other processes which Nature cannot do as she is not
impelled to do such works. That is why the material has to be transformed
into a better form than Nature has given it.
<p>Then you must know how to draw off silver’s incombustible sulfur, because
silver is an imperfect body, cold, moist, and crude, containing much moisture
and blackness. It is very earthly, crude, and feminine on account of its
coldness. Therefore everybody piles silver upon gold. This is the reason
why the combustible sulfur, the earthiness and blackness, has first to
be removed from silver. So, take as much silver as you like, refine it
on the cupel and laminate it. Then take the sublimated auripigment, the
middle material, as has been taught in the work concerning it. Rind it
small on a stone with vinegar to the consistency of a paste, coat the silver
laminae, dry them in the sun, near a fire or in a room, put them in a crucible,
one upon the other till the crucible is full, lute them together, put the
matter for 12 hours in a calcinations furnace with a very small fire, so
that the silver does not melt, cool it, pound it in an iron mortar or scrape
the calcined matter off. If it is not yet calcined enough, calcine it again
or till the silver is calcined, grind it on a stone with common distilled
water, till the water again runs off clear from the powder. Then dry it
in the sun or near the fire and preserve it in a glass. Evaporate the water
with which the silver has been washed, refine the faeces on the cupel,
and in this way you will not lose anything. File your silver finely, and
Rx to one oz of silver take 3j of prepared arsenic. Stratify it, calcine
it for 12 or 16 hours, then grind and wash it, as I taught before.
<p>After this, take the silver powder, heat it to redness for 24 or 32
hours, then calcine it for 12 days in which the spirits are calcined, so
that it lows red-hot --- but not completely so. When the 12 days are over,
let it glow modestly, brown, red, for 3 days, but so that it does not melt.
Then cool it, and it is prepared.
<p>For silver has two sicknesses, like other imperfect metals, but its
two sicknesses do not go to the inmost root as do those of the other imperfect
metals. One sickness is the combustible sulphur, the other is cold and
humidity. The first sickness is eliminated with arsenic and washing. Know
that the substance of arsenic is so strong that it burns and destroys all
bodies. The same is done by auripigment and sulfur; these they are of one
nature. Follow Nature with the Art. Sometimes we must go beyond Nature
by separating, rectifying, dissolving, coagulating, purifying, combining,
and incerating the earth, and undertake many other processes which nature
cannot do, as she is not impelled to do such works. That is why the material
has to be transformed into a better form than nature has given it.
<p>Then you must know how to draw off silver’s combustible sulfur, because
silver is an imperfect body, cold, moist, and coarse, containing much moisture
and blackness. It is very earthy, coarse, and feminine on account of its
coldness. Therefore everybody piles silver upon gold. This is the reason
why the combustible sulfur, the earthiness and blackness have first to
be removed from silver. So, take as much silver as you like, refine it
on the cupel and laminate it. Then take the sublimated auripigment, the
middle material, as has been taught in the work concerning it, grind it
small on a stone with vinegar, to the consistency of a paste, coat the
silver laminae, dry them in the sun, near the fire, or in a room, put them
in a crucible, one upon the other till the crucible is full, lute them
together, put the substance for 12 hours in a calcination furnace with
a very small fire, so that the silver does not melt. Cool it, pound it
in an iron mortar or scrape the cacined matter off, and if it is not yet
calcined enough, calcine it again until the silver is calcined. Now grind
it on a stone with common water, then wash its blackness off in a lass
dish with common distilled water, till the water again runs off clear from
the powder. Then dry it in the sun or near the fire and preserve it in
a glass. Evaporate the water with which silver has been washed, refine
the faeces on the cupel, and in this way you will not lose anything. File
your silver small, and Rx to 1 oz of silver, 3j of prepared arsenic; stratify
it, calcine it for 12 or 16 hours, then grind and wash it, as I taught
before.
<p>After this, take the silver powder, heat it to redness for 24 or 32
hours, then calcine it for 12 days in the furnace in which the spirits
are calcined, so that it glows red-hot, but not completely so. When the
12 days are over, let it glow modestly for 3 days, brown, red, but so that
it does not melt, and it is prepared.
<p>For silver has two sicknesses, like other imperfect metals, but its
two sicknesses do not go to the innermost root as do those of the other
imperfect metals. One sickness is the combustible sulfur, the other is
cold and humidity. The first sickness is eliminated by arsenic and washing.
Know that the substance of arsenic is so coarse that it burns and destroys
all bodies. The same is done by auripigment and sulfur. These three are
of one nature.
<p>When arsenic and auripigment are disembodied and cleansed of their impurity,
density, and wild unfixed spirits, and you take the middle spirit, then
with this spirit you will draw away the combustibility of the sulfur of
metals by calcining, washing, purging, reiterating. For if the poison in
the theriac is not prepared, it will kill men; but when it is prepared,
it drives the poison out. Likewise arsenic and auripigment.
<p>Prepare the gold into a most subtle powder, as has been taught in the
work on silver, in the following way: Rx, gold and silver prepared, mix
them together, rubbing them on a stone with water like painters’ color.
Dry it again, reverbarate it on a big cupel, till it swells like a sponge,
cool it, take it out, dissolve it in vinegar, distill it in the Balneum,
as is said in the work on silver. Then dissolve it again, and continue
doing this dissolving and coagulating till no more faeces are left. Now
the Work is done about which Dantin says: Open the enclosed, wet it; close
what has been opened, and dry it; do likewise with the coldness of Luna,
and you will find the warmth of gold, and you will find the coldness of
Luna.
<p>Now the material is ready for extracting the Stone. Most of the material
of the gold will rise and take with it all the subtle parts of silver.
The parts of silver that are coarse, phlegmatic, and feminine remain at
the bottom.
<p>Sol alone is subtle and masculine in its parts. When Sol is dissolved
and opened, it grows up altogether because of its great subtlety, but Luna
stays at the bottom and is not yet ready to grow up on account of its coarseness.
<p>There is therefore a contrary in these two lights; what is the ruin
of one is the enhancement of the other, and that is why they belong together
in the Work, as you well know.
<p>After this, sublimate this material in the manner taught in the White
and the Red. Watch out for the air when you open the glass, so that it
does not kill you [Arsine, arsenic hydride].
<p>For this reason allow the vessel to cool down completely. If the spirits
went out through the lute during sublimation, or if the head were to break,
or the glass or the pot, it would kill you by its subtle poison.
<p>For there is no subtler or hotter, no more violent spirit among all
metals than the spirit of Sol. If it were to open in its parts as is Luna
or other metals, or if the 4 Elements that are together in Sol were contraries,
it would sooner fly from the fire than from some other mineral spirits.
But in Sol the Elements are all equal and tempered, and so clean that they
are never separated.
<p>Therefore, when Sol is opened, it flies together with others without
leaving anything behind, unless something of other metals or baser things
were intermixed with it, as there are many who melt other metallic bodies
or minerals together with Sol, because everything that comes from minerals
likes to dwell with gold and stays with it in a friendly manner, because
Sol is the king and master.&nbsp; That is why anyone wishing to make a
work with Sol alone must take care not to open Sol so much that the ferment
follows it, otherwise one would rise with the other. If that happens, you
must add some Sol to the ferment of fresh powder --- if you wish to make
the Stone, but it would not serve anything to add red ferment. If it should
happen that your Sol were to glow up immediately, it would be better for
you to make the White Stone by using Luna. Melt the matter so that you
can increate it with the spirit of Sol, and you will doubly benefit.
<p>For you must make the White Stone by the power of Sol, and you must
bring your spirit together with the soul, in her own might, of which instruction
will be given in other works. You might ask: I believed that Sol had been
fixed from the beginning, as it stays on the cupel, also in cement, in
antimony, and in the fire --- and if it stayed there flowing till Doomsday,
it would not be burnt up. And if it were lying in the earth till the end
of the world, would it be corrupted? Sol cannot be corrupted by anything
in the world. Sol is simple, that is, in all its parts and Elements are
not contraries, and its oil and salt are so united with the 4 Elements,
and its Mercury and Sulfur are within so closely intermixed and in such
proportion that they are one mature. They are equal in all their parts,
so that Sol is nothing but one single thing, and one thing alone, which
is not constituted of any other thing. You cannot separate it by anything.
Therefore, Sol and Luna are opposed to air.
<p>In regard to the Stone, when you sublimate, bind two glass eyemirrors
in front of your eyes and a broad leather over your mouth and nose, into
which leather a broad double woolen cloth must be sewn. On the broad cloth
put a white sponge with which to tie up your nostrils and mouth. Protect
yourselves thus from the air, because Sol and Luna rise invisibly, and
the Stone is sublimated till it leaves no more faeces but is as beautiful
and white as snow and clear as crystal.
<p>You have now prepared Mercury, and the Sulfur of the Philosophers in
all its power and subtlety. Keep all the faeces that have been left behind
during sublimation, because you must reverbarate them again. For it is
the body of Luna that has not yet glowed up. You are to dissolve the body
and the ferment of our Stone in the following way; the body out of the
faeces with distilled vinegar --- everything that will dissolve. Then coagulate
it, after that reverbarate it for 24 hours with a gentle fire, so that
it does not get more than red-hot. Let it cool.
<p>Now remove and dissolve it again with distilled vinegar, coagulate it,
reverbarate it for 5 or 6 hours, not letting it become more than red-hot.
Allow it to cool, dissolve it again with common water, coagulate it again.
Thereafter heat it to a red heat for the duration of 5 or 6 Pater Nosters.
Now take it out again and dissolve it in common water until nothing is
left behind. If that is not the case, dissolve and coagulate it again till
almost all the moisture is evaporated and distilled, then let it cool.
When it is cold, should be together, pieces as large as a finger’s length,
clear as crystal and white as snow.
<p>This manipulation must be done in glass bowls made for the purpose,
standing in a boiling Balneum, and the cask must be covered with a double
linen cloth to prevent any dust or impurity from falling into it. Our work
must be clean, clean in the extreme, when you prepare your Pretiosa terra
and your Corpus, and you prepare the Soul to receive and absorb your ferment
in great unity and peace, so that they will nevermore be separated from
each other but shall at all times reign with great subtlety and powers.
<p>The Body desires to receive its own Soul and Spirit, while the Soul
with the Spirit desire to come down and rest with their own Body, because
one cannot be without the other. When they are then together, one in the
other as they are supposed to be, held by an immovable and unchangeable
button, one nature, one simple thing like the invincible heaven --- then
it is the Fifth Essence by which all diseases can be cured and resolved.
<p>There are many ways to make the Stone, but one is more difficult, laborious,
and&nbsp; longer than the other, and not all are equally high in the projection.
The Stone made with the great ferment is less potent than one made with
a prepared body. Consequently, you must make projection after a subtle
Work. The Stone must be extracted from Sol and Luna. Both must be Rebus
vir. (Aleph), the Red man and the Alba Foemina, the White Woman, if a right
union is to occur; because the hot Red Man must act upon the cold White
Woman, if you wish to obtain fruit from the union, and a perfect Work is
to take place.
<p>For you would be unable to separate anything from a pure simple thing,
just as pure water does not turn into anything but pure water, although
it may be purified if it contains faeces. You can extract and purify those
by various manipulations, and this water is then better than the first,
but it remains water, and you cannot make anything else from it.
<p>Thus it is with Sol and Luna if you try to work with each one separately.
Sol is Sol and remains Sol. Luna is Luna and remains so, unless you spiritualize
it and add it to its own body in order to congeal its own spirit, so as
to enable it to make projection upon purified metals in the 3rd Order.
It is a simple medicine of the 3rd Order and nothing else.
<p>The Stone must be made from spiritual things that cannot be separated,
and from two natures, cold and hot, from snow and light, white and red,
gross and subtle, man and woman, so that one acts upon the nature of the
other, making the gross subtle, and the subtle gross; the light heavy,
the hot cold, the moist dry, and the dry moist. Thus one nature acts upon
another until finally all things are turned into one simple nature. Then
each thing will be in a better condition and in a better higher form, or
also in another substance, then the thing is perfect like an invincible
heaven, which is simple. But the earth does not require any moisture, which
is given it in abundance by heaven. Likewise with heat and cold.
<p>Everything the earth lacks, heaven can supply in abundance. Nevertheless,
heaven is neither cold nor warm, neither moist nor dry, a simple body and
perfect in the extreme perfection and quality. Consequently, everything
the earth, plants, trees, human beings, and animals requires, is supplied
by heaven in abundance. Likewise with heat and cold, and everything else
needed by the earth. Heaven can give it abundantly owing to the great powers
with which God has invested it by His divine ordination and wonderful omnipotence.
<p>Thus you are to understand that the Stone is a simple medicine of the
3rd Order, because our Stone must have the property which God has invisibly
instilled into heaven. Therefore we must infuse into it the same quality
of our Philosophical mastery, so that it may have the same quality and
mastery that exists in a simple body --- and when it has all this quality
and power, only then is it our Stone.
<p>In this way I have taught you how and out of what the Stone is to be
made and of what quality it must be before it can be called the Stone.
<p>Now take the body or the earth or the ferment, weigh it, and write it
in a book. Put it in such a glass as is illustrated here. Then take 8 parts
of ferment, 3 of your sublimation and put it in a small glass. Pour distilled
water on the ferment, put on each glass some cut glass fitted to the mouth
of the glass, set each in hot Balneum, and it will at once dissolve into
clear water. When they are dissolved, pour both water together into a glass,
stir well --- they mingle easily --- because they wish to be friends. The
man wants his own lady of the house; the lady of the house, her own man;
the dry cold earth wants the moisture of the water. Thus one wants to embrace
the other and to enter into the other to the inmost root. There is then
a perfect mingling --- and yet it is not a perfect mingling, as when there
is water mingling with water there is no hindrance, it is done immediately
without any delay, for each desires to receive the other on account of
the great purity which both have, and one loves the other.
<p>Thus one penetrated the other in the first mingling which took place
in clear water. Mix the clear water one with the other, as has been said
above, distill it in the Balneum with the receptacle and the alembic well
luted, draw the moisture off to dry it to a powder, take it out and congeal
it in the secret furnace, as is taught in the White Work. Heat it in the
same way, and in a short time you will see that all the material has become
black. Then you will know what a perfect union has occurred, and underneath
the blackness the whiteness is concealed. If the blackness does not appear
in the Work, no perfect union will take place, or fixation between Soul,
Spirit, and Body. It holds that together which is the means, the Salt of
the Wise, which keeps the Soul, the Body, and the Spirit alive, causing
one to enter the other. The salt is still lying in the inmost of the body,
because the spirit has not drawn the soul out of the body, where the Salt
of nature remains hidden in the deepest of the mixture.
<p>The salt is the medium which keeps spirit, body, and soul together,
and the salt lies buried in the deepest of the mixture. How then can the
salt be shared with them when it is not drawn out of the deepest of the
mixture together with the spirit which would rise along with it? How then
could the salt be part of the spirit? The salt has within itself a soul,
and
that is why it is a medium between body, soul, and spirit, because
it must share in them, must keep spirit, soul, and body together with its
sharpness, so that one may permeate the other.
<p>If the salt is not extracted from the body by the spirit, carrying the
soul in it as it rises, it remains hidden in the deepest of the body. Consequently,
the salt must be extracted fro the body with the spirit, containing a soul
and a spirit. Together with those it must rise and become one thing with
them, if it is to be a medium between the spirit and the body, because
the salt contains a soul and a body. It cannot live without a soul belonging
to it, and the soul cannot be without the spirit. Therefore the salt must
be one thing with the spirit, and the spirit with the soul. That is why
the salt is a medium between these two, if they wish to remain together.
<p>Arnoldus de Villanova says that the salt is wonderful, and from these
words it is evident that no perfect fixation can be accomplished if the
salt is not extracted from the body with the spirit, as is prescribed.
They fail each time who make an amalgam with Sol and [?], or with Luna,
and Mercury, and try to fix them. It cannot be done at all, because the
salt lies in the deepest of Sol and Luna, and it cannot be extracted from
the inmost of Sol and Luna by any substance in the world except by their
own spirit --- and not by any foreign spirits.
<p>Sol and Luna must therefore be opened and freed in such a way that they
let go of their spirit, thus drawing the salt, and with it the soul from
the deepest of Sol and Luna, and carrying them upward into heaven, to become
one nature with it.
<p>When now body and spirit are prepared with the slat which carries the
soul in it, when the soul is purified and reunited with its own purified
body, spirit, and slat, there will be a right conjunction, and the whole
will become black. Where this is done, blackness should appear. Therefore
it is obvious that all amalgamations, fixations, cinnabars, or all other
crazy, enticing, fast works are wrong and deceitful (although they appear
to be something). You should avoid all of them with their false opinions,
and take great care to be enlightened by the philosophy according to the
ancients who say on their books that our stone, which is to b extracted,
must be made out of one things only and not out of many, nor must anything
be added to it, be it small or big. But extract its soul and discard from
it everything superfluous, purify its body, add that again to its soul,
and it will live forever.
<p>When you see its blackness, you will be sure that its conjunction has
taken place. After that, continue with the fire from one degree to another,
be it of whatever color it may, as is taught in the White Work. When you
see that, remove it, mix it, and test it on a glowing sheet to see if it
is fixed and can stand fire. Then take it out and calcine it in the reverbaration
furnace for 24 hours with a gentle fire. Let it cool, weigh it, then dissolve
it as prescribed. When both are dissolved in clear water, mix them together
as said before, draw the moisture off in the Balneum, and congeal it in
the secret furnace as before.
<p>Note here that it is not necessary to dissolve the spirit. The Stone
gets stronger in every solution and coagulation, and it becomes a hundred
times more powerful in projection. It is also the surest ferment for dissolving
the spirits, both in clear water. Therefore they must be mixed together
dry, because that is a better and surer mixture than mingling water with
water, as said above. When the spirit has been fixed with the ferment,
it has also to be calcined and coagulated to make the Work as subtle as
possible, so that another projection can be made with it afterwards.
<p>Take 4 parts of ferment and 1 part of spirit, mix them. But you must
not calcine, dissolve, and coagulate often. The Work would far too soon
begin to melt under your hands, so that no calcinations could be done.
Therefore, if you wish to make an important Work, and a very subtle one,
take much ferment and little spirit. Then you can calcine, dissolve, and
coagulate the Work frequently. Whether you add mush or little spirit to
the ferment, it takes an equally long time. If you add but a little spirit
to the ferment, the Work is fixed. If you add much spirit to the ferment,
it will take longer till it begins to congeal. After that, do as prescribed.
Take 1 part of spirit to 8 parts of ferment, dissolve, and mix them together,
as said above, till the material becomes as liquid that it can no longer
be made red-hot or calcined. Then stop and give the spirit in the right
amount. When that is done, continue increasing the fire from degree to
degree till, with God’s help and praise, you reach the perfect redness.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Multiplication</font></b></center>

<p>Multiplication means multiplying your Stone in its power but not in
its size, that is, it should increase in its nobility and subtlety, so
that, if it now does 10,000 in the projection, its projection will reach
100,000 after it has been multiplied, subtilized, and elevated in its greatness
and power.
<p>If you multiply and subtilize the Stone 3 times in its power, its projection
will be without end because of its great subtlety, so that it could be
multiplied so often that the end of the projection could never be reached.
<p>But it might also be multiplied so often that it could not be kept in
any glass. It would go through it, and if you wished to dissolve it, it
would go through the glass invisibly. The glass would not be broken, but
its color would be changed into that of a ruby. So, when the Stone has
been made, set the glass to melt, throw the Stone on it, as much powder
as you care to take as if you wished to transmute tin into Sol. When the
Stone is melted, the glass will have the color of a ruby. Now set the glass
to melt and keep it molten in the crucible for a half hour, and your material
will become so hard that it will never again melt. And in that hard state
it will have as wonderful colors as very beautiful spotless rubies.
<p>The ancients said that the glass thus made by the Stone is much more
precious than natural rubies, of which you will read in the Book of Stones,
written by Hermes. Because Hermes says: If your Stone is thrown on anything
that can be melted and which is not metal but a thing of Nature, it will
change it into itself, as much as it is able to do, just as God created
man like him in regard to eternity, liberty, and many other things too
long to enumerate. The Stone converts a thing into itself, and it will
be a thing of one nature. In the world nothing is found that is One nature,
except crystals, glass, or precious stones. All other things are made of
composed things, they are not made of One thing. From crystals or glass
nothing can result but crystals or glass, though it is possible to infuse
color into them, whichever you like. On white crystal glass, which is like
a fine smooth plate, you can write whatever you wish. Likewise the Stone;
it adds wonderful colors to crystals or glass, and it makes its like in
the colors, though not in the same degree and power that it would be converted
into them and make projection with them. But it is very wonderful and beautiful
and the finest in the world, also much more precious than gold. The glass
never melts or burns.
<p>Therefore, when the crystals or glass are melted in a strong crucible,
throw the Stone on them till you see that you like the color, because the
Stone penetrates glass or crystal like oil does strong leather. When the
color pleases you, stop throwing more of the Stone on it and let the crystals
burn together with the Stone till the material develops into a King and
becomes hard and transparent, because the [ Symbol (-|) ] converts all
fusible things into undissolvable ones, and all undissolvable ones into
fusible ones, it makes all hard bodies tender, and all tender bodies hard,
and all combustible things incombustible. But it (the King) does not have
this property. Therefore it cannot be called a Stone, because it is no
more than a medicine of the second Order, and nothing but the invincible
heaven. For what the earth lacks, heaven can supply, and yet, what it gives
is not of its nature. Likewise our Stone: It makes all dry bodies moist
and all moisture dry, all coldness hot and al heat cold, all impurities
pure, and unspeakably more of the same.
<p>If you wish to make such rubies, do as is prescribed. When they have
cooled, cut them into pieces and smooth them in a stone mill at your discretion.
Thus you will have the very finest rubies without spots. They will rejoice
men’s hearts and render a master who wears them victorious and cause him
to dominate his enemies. He is loved by men and protected from disease.
That is why you must multiply the Stone so often that it becomes quite
subtle. But if you wish to dissolve it in the red burning water to make
it go invisibly through the glasses, you will be deprived of your stone,
and finally you will be unable to keep it in the glasses, even if they
were 10 feet thick.
<p>Therefore, multiply your Stone in the following manner: prepare an AF
of vitriol, clarified and purified of its faeces, and as much Salt. Distill
it according to the Art. Then take the Death’s Head, pulverize it finely,
pour common distilled water over it. Let the salt leach, dissolve, and
sink. Filter it till it is clear, coagulate it again. When it is coagulated,
pulverize it again, put it in a large glass pot, pour into it the distilled
AF, and distill again whatever can be distilled. Now take the Death’s Head,
pulverize it as before, and continue this manipulation till you have distilled
all the salt with the AF Then you have a precious red water, shining at
night like fire and lightning.
<p>Now rectify your water several times in the Balneum with pouring of
and pouring on, till you have at last distilled everything over. Thus a
wonderful water is prepared, in which you must multiply and open your Stone.
Take your blessed Stone, dissolve it in this water, it will dissolve immediately.
Put it in a lukewarm Balneum, the alembic and the receptacle firmly luted
all around, and keep it warm.
<p>When now your AF has been distilled over, take a little of the powder
in the glass pot, put it on a red-hot plate, and see if it smokes, as I
have taught elsewhere. Pour the water back on it, lute it again, distill
as before till there is nothing left to distill. Then try and test it again
as before, to see if it now smokes somewhat.
<p>If it does not smoke more than the first time, pour AF on it again,
set it in the Balneum and do as has been taught before. Continue with this
manipulation till everything smokes off the red-hot plates. Then it is
opened and dissolved enough. Now sublimate it 3 or 4 times as before, each
time without adding anything, as it requires no faeces, then it is enough.
<p>Now take a small part of the sublimated substance, and in order to congeal
the material, set it in a retort-glass in the furnace in which the spirits
are calcined, put a small piece of glass on its mouth, give it first a
small fire or heat, increasing the fire all the time by degrees, as is
taught in the Work. When it is fixed, weigh it to see how much there is
of the fixed part. Then take 1 part of the spirit to 3 parts of the fixed
material, set it again to congeal, as taught before, and do this till everything
sublimated is fixed. It will be congealed immediately. When it is quite
fixed in all its parts, the other parts which had been added to the first
part, will be less fixed than the first, because one part fixes the other
part.
<p>In this multiplication there will be no blackness, and no colors whatsoever
will appear, nor whiteness. Even during sublimation nothing else appears
but the redness, because the Stone has no other color than red, for it
is nothing but a sublimation, invincible like the simple heaven, a simple
clarified body. For it must be one only if it is to make projection, spirit,
soul, and body equally strong. If the body were stronger than the spirit,
or the spirit stronger than the body, its nature would be made of opposites
which would not be one thing only. Nevertheless, it would not have been
brought out of its own nature into another nature, yet that is how it must
be. If it were not so, it would not accomplish any projection. The Stone
must be sublimated, thereby changing it from a fixed nature into a spiritual
one. Our body is a body, soul, and spirit, and these three are one thing
only, joined together indivisibly, one great power, on substance, and one
nature. In their being on, they are like the Holy Trinity. Father, Son
and Holy Ghost, three in One in the might, and One in the simple of the
substance, and one is not without the other. The Father is not the Son,
the Son is not the Holy Ghost, nor is the Holy Ghost the Father, and yet
these three Persons are eternally one simple substance.
<p>And thus our Stone is neither fixed nor volatile. It is both, body and
spirit, and both must be equally strong in its nature, as it is taught.
It seems to be fixed enough to stand the fire. This is due to its firm
inter-penetration; the parts of the Stone have inter-penetrated so strongly
that it is quite compact, and in addition there is in the world nothing
cleaner and subtler. The cleaner and subtler a thing is, the more the clean
and subtle things are firmly combined and inter-penetrated, and the heavier
their weight is. For they love each other, so that they are merged into
one and can hardly be separated from one another. See how it can stand
the fire. The fire cannot overcome its parts because they are so firm.
Nevertheless it is a pure spirit, because now that it is open, it flies
away much more easily than some spirits. This is so on account of its great
subtlety, its great cleanliness, both of which belong to its nature.
<p>How could our Stone not fight fire better and more strongly? For it
is both, composed of body and spirit. As they are both one, how could the
Stone not resist fire more strongly and mightily than gold, and it also
resists fire. Our Stone must therefore resist fire a thousand times more
strongly than Sol.
<p>When now our Stone is open and unlocked by our burning water which separates
its condensed parts, and swells like a sponge, Sol flies up with a small
fire, smaller than that required for some spirits, due to the great subtlety
that God has bestowed on it. How much sooner then will our Stone fly up
than Sol, with little heat and less fire, because our Stone has the extreme
subtlety and power that can be given it, so that it is a thousand times
subtler than Sol. When then its parts are united in the right proportion,
so that they inter-penetrate, we call it fixed.
<p>Thus the Stone must again pass through the fire and suffer what it suffered
before, and a thousand times more, when it will become a thousand times
and more subtle than before. For as often as you open and close the Stone,
make it subtle and sublimate it, and again unite it, as often it obtains
a stronger nature and tinges a thousand times more than before. If you
multiply the Stone, elevate or exalt it in its potency, its nature is not
changed, because it does not become black, nor does it produce various
colors, but it remains in is own essence and nature, the same which it
had in the beginning. When it has been processed to the extreme, so that
no manipulation or art in the world can change it from its simple substance,
you can nevertheless make it subtler still, also open and close as it as
prescribed, subtilize it and open it in small parts, so that its parts
may be made firmer, all the more. We call that fixation, and it is nothing
but making firm, so that all subtle parts may be better be kept together
than before, to enable us to make projection with it. Thus the Stone may
be multiplied three or four times, but no more, as it would become far
too subtle and would disappear invisibly.
<p>Thus the ancients used to make the Stone, as have been taught above,
before the art of the strong water had been invented. Then the lights had
to be dissolved, slowly by hand, with calcinations, reverberation, and
dissolution in our strong acetum distillatum and with coagulating till
our Stone was spiritual. After that, they worked as has been taught before.
And when the Stone was completed, they did not know the right art to multiply
it in its own power. They only had one single Stone. After its projection
they worked to make it subtle by dissolving it in strong acetum destillatum,
then coagulated it till it turned into a fine oil. When they wished to
turn the oil back into a hard mass, they took one part of gold, disembodies
it and make it red like blood. They mixed it together with their dissolve
oil, coagulated it and put it in the secret furnace in moderate heat till
it was changed into a dark mass, red like dragon’s blood, which was now
subtler than before on account of its many dissolutions and coagulations.
<p>All this their successors saw. They sharpened their wits and discovered
strong water, whereby they shortened the long way. For they made AF with
which they could rub both bodies inside, and after the purification they
mixed the water, worked the mixture without faeces till it was transparent
and clear, and thus managed easily to bring it to spirituality and its
extreme perfection. With the same strong water well rectified, they could
subtilize and multiply the Stone in its own power and that in every way,
as said before. The AF is a great aid for shortening the Work and achieving
a higher projection of the Stone, with the help of God.
<p>In addition, I will teach you how to infuse the spirit of the Red Man
into the body of the White Woman. It is a pleasant and noble thing and
work of the Art, as you will hear.
<p>Therefore, take first silver, cleanly refined on the cupel and purified
of Saturn. Dissolve it in its white Water, pushs it to the bottom, wash
it carefully of its salt in warm water, reverbarate it so that it swells,
then dissolve in rectified distilled vinegar, all that will dissolve. Reverbarate
the rest again, and dissolve it as before, till everything is dissolved.
Thereafter draw the vinegar off and dissolve everything that will dissolve
in common rectified water. Gather all these solutions. Dry what does not
dissolve, then dissolve it again in distilled vinegar, and if it still
does not dissolve, reverbarate it once more, so that it may dissolve more
easily in vinegar. If it were to dissolve better in water, it would be
fine. Let it stand thus and dissolve it in distilled vinegar. Draw the
vinegar off and dissolve it in common water. Continue doing this till everything
is dissolved into clear water. Now draw this off, calcine the Luna somewhat
to remove the spirit of vinegar from it. Thereafter, dissolve it again
in common water. If there were anything that does not dissolve, clean it
again or prepare it wit the solution of the vinegar. Then calcine it till
everything is dissolved in water, without faeces and spirit of vinegar.
Then draw the water off dry, and your Luna thus purified is quite suitable
for this Work. Keep this white body in a glass jar, in a warm room, to
keep it dry.
<p>Thereafter take Sol, well purified in Regal Cement, dissolve it in its
red water, put it in some rectified common water, wash the lime carefully
of the salt of the aforesaid water, dry it, and set it to be calcined in
the vaulted furnace in order to open it, for 12 days, in mild heat. Then
put it into is rectified water, dissolve it in the Balneum, and leave it
standing in it to putrefy for 83 days. Then distill the water off and put
what is left at the bottom of a glass crucible, wit a piece of cut glass
over its mouth. Set this in a receptacle cut through the middle, put the
upper part back, set an alembic with a receptacle luted to it in sand or
ashes, standing so deep that the material is two or three fingers’ breadth
in the ashes. First give a small fire, then gradually a stronger, till
the big receptacle turns visibly rd-hot. Keep it standing in hat heat for
8 days, then let it cool of its own, and take it out.
<p>If it is still whole, leave the Sol in it, but if it is broken up, put
it in another glass inside a strong earthenware cask, so that two crucibles
are adjusted to each other. Put your glass inside, well luted, likewise
the crucible well luted one on top of the other. First let it dry, then
calcine more and more till the earthenware cask is red-hot, but take care
that the Sol does not melt. Let it stand in this heat for 12 days, then
let it cool of itself, remove your Sol, and you will find it red like dragon’s
blood.
<p>And this is a sign that it has been dismembered. If it were not red,
rather yellow or in between, it would have to be dissolved again in its
red rectified water. Then proceed as taught here. Therefore continue till
it is dismembered and red like blood. Then put what is red in the rectified
water till it is completely putrefied and everything has become volatile
at the same time. Now push it to the bottom, wash its salt off neatly,
dissolve it in distilled vinegar and in common rectified water, coagulate
and calcine it gently in the calcination furnace for spirits, so as to
remove from it the spirit of vinegar but not to lose any of its natural
moisture.
<p>Now sublimate it according to the Art, as said elsewhere, and continue
with this sublimation till nothing is left behind. Then the spirit is well
prepared or purified. Use it to increate the body of Luna till it reaches
perfect whiteness. Thereafter bring it to redness, as taught before.
<p>If you wish to multiply its might and power, and if it has previously
been turned into the White and the Red, enough work has been done. Use
your Stone in the peace and obedience of God.

<p><b><font size=+1>This Is The Book of the Stone</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>And Its Subsequent Projection</font></b></center>

<p>Now I must and will teach you how you are to use the Stone. If you intend
to convert the Stone into Sol and Luna, do not throw it on anything unless
it has first been prepared to this end. If you wish to throw it on tin,
melt it in a crucible to test it with 1 lb of tin and 3/3 fine silver together.
Throw your White Stone on it, and this tin will be transformed into genuine
silver, much or less according to the subtlety of the Stone, as you will
hear later. If you wish to throw your red Stone, throw it on silver. It
is not necessary to open the latter. All you have to do is melt it and
throw a Red Stone on it, and Luna will turn into genuine Sol, better than
that which comes out of the mines.
<p>Always throw your White Stone on tin, and not on other metals, because
the Stone must do nothing but cook it completely, as I have taught elsewhere.
The other metals might also be converted into silver, but they are much
impurer than tin, and the projection would not be as high. In addition,
the Stone would have to be worked much longer in the fire together with
the impure metals before it would result in a King. That is why the Stone
has to be thrown on tin, because tin is closest to Luna.
<p>After that, make a projection of the Red Stone on Luna, because Luna
is the purest and cleanest metal on which you can make projection. Nor
can any projection with the Red Stone be made except on Luna alone. If
you throw the Red Stone on lead or another metal, it will not accomplish
anything, as the red Stone makes nothing but gold, and no metal results
in gold unless they are first tuned into silver. For gold has always first
been silver before it becomes gold. Nature must first produce silver before
the latter turns into gold, because one cannot get beyond 100 miles unless
one has walked the way that lies between.
<p>But throw the White Stone on whatever metal you wish, it till turn silver.
It happens because you are making your metals come alive and infuse your
soul into them, as Morienus says: Our metal is not a vulgar metal, for
it is alive and has a soul.
<p>For one cannot reach the third degree from the first, as is taught in
vegetabili, animalu and minerali. One has to know the manner of projection.
If you throw the Stone on silver or tin, you will not accomplish anything.
Even if you had already infused a soul into the metals, or if it were a
living body such as silver, the Stone must be admixed nevertheless. If
it had penetrated quite subtly and firmly, and even if it were a powder
and the metal were roughly melted, it would stand nonetheless on top of
the metals upon which it is thrown. When then it stands on the metals,
the Stone may well melt and float on the metal, spreading above, but it
will keep the metal from moving. It protects it to prevent the combustible
sulfur from flying away, and the fire from consuming the metal, because
the Stone lies on it like oil.
<p>However, it does not mix with the metals, as little as oil mixes with
water if the two are brought together, but instead it stays still. Thus
oil always floats on top, preserving the water from foreign moisture, so
that the latter cannot enter the water, and the water or the subtle spirit
does not evaporate because of the air, as all waters have a subtle spirit.
<p>For if you let your water stand 4 or 5 days, as it is, uncovered, it
will soon smell bad, being robbed of its subtle spirits. If the oil were
to float on it, however, it would not smell bad even if it stood thus for
10 days. The oil protects the water from corruption and prevents its spirit
from plying away.
<p>How is it that oil does not mix with water and always floats on top
of it, although it is heavier than water? You must know that oil has no
part in the water, although it had been one body with the water. The Quinta
Essentia contains the oil together with other things. When the oil is beaten,
one sees very well that it is white. The Quinta Esentia has come from one
thing only. Water, Fire, Air, Earth, Oil, and Salt, all kept together,
must be separated because, just as the Quinta Essentia has come from one
thing only, they must all separate from each other. Thereafter, they must
no longer be combined before they are clarified. That is why Fire, that
is the Oil, will not mingle, although it had formed one body with the water,
although the oil contains a much coarser part. It also contains Sol. The
parts of the oil are firmly interpenetrated, so that they do not separate
from one another. It is a firm Element and quite open, due to the coarseness
which it contains. The oil is subtle and fiery and firmly presses into
one, so that all the fieriness will be above, and all subtlety will rise,
and the firm parts do not wish to separate to enable them to penetrate
through the firm water, on account of the evil smell, and that is why the
oil must necessarily swim above.
<p>Likewise our Stone. It also floats on the metals like oil on water,
because the Stone does not form a part of the metals, although it had been
a metal. However, it is heavier than metal, that is, it is subtle and stands
on the molten metal as firmly as water.
<p>Consequently, the Stone does not have the nature of metals, for it is
only Quint.Ess,, that is why it will not intermix or interpenetrate, and
this is due to its fatty parts, and it must needs swim above.
<p>Hermes says that our Stone must form a part with Body, Soul, and Spirit.
But in the Stone the parts are united in such a perfection and such a spiritual
substance that they do not mix with the impure parts, except by a means
which must be united with the spiritual substance, be it White or Red.
<p>No conjunction can occur in any things that are contraries except by
a means which causes the two extremities to penetrate and embrace each
other and stay together. Likewise in the projection of the Stone. It does
not wish to stay, mix with, and penetrate the rotten, evil smelling, black,
imperfect metals without a means. For the impure black metals are contraries
like the Stone and cannot be mixed together and penetrates without a means.
This must be a living body, and the same living body must be one with the
Stone, White or Red. When these two unclean evil-smelling metals have within
themselves this unclean living body, which is one with them like the soul
with the body, and the White or the Red Stone is thrown upon them, and
they now also have within themselves the same living body, then they can
be joined. Thus each begets its own of its own nature, so that a conjunction
results and one penetrates the other. The Stone expels all their corruption
and produces a perfect living body, better than those from the mines.
<p>Now I will teach you how you must prepare the Stone, White or Red, so
that it adapts to the crude metals and penetrates them. It is done as follows:
Take the Red Stone, 1 part, and Sol 1000 parts. Beat it into thin sheets.
Then take sulfur, pound it with a stone into a thick pap with olive oil,
and grease your sheets with it, dry them, put them on hot coals and calcine
them. Thereafter pulverize them and wash the powder off with common water
till the water runs off the powder clear and pure. Pound the powder further
on a stone with honey or gum-water, the way one pounds painters’ paint.
Then put it in a glass bowl and wash it again with common distilled water.
The powder will sink to the bottom. Pour the water off and continue doing
this till the water runs off clear from the powder. After this, dry it
again in the sun or on a small fire, and your gold is ready.
<p>Thereafter take 1000 parts of this powder and 1 part of the Stone pulverized
finely, mix them together. Then take a crucible that can well stand a good
strong fire. Upon this crucible set another crucible, like a closed dish.
Grind both well on a stone to make them fit tightly, add your powder, lute
the crucible inside and outside strongly and carefully, by 3 or 4 fingers’
breadth, and dry the lute well. Then set it in another crucible in a wind-furnace,
first with a small fire, then ever stronger and stronger, from degree to
degree, till the crucible is red hot. Therefore increase your fire considerably
till you are sure that the material is melting in the crucible. Therefore,
let the crucible stand for 3 days in such a heat as will keep the material
in fusion all the time. Then let it cool of its own, break the crucible
open, and you will find a hard mass, brittle like glass, which can be pulverized.
When you wish to make projection, take 1 part of this powder, 1000 parts
of the pure metal insouled and made alive, transmute it into real Sol and
Luna, better than the mineral. This is the Work of 3 Days of which the
ancients wrote in their books, and it is the Work which renders the base
bodies so subtle in 3 days that, if the Stone is thus melted, the gold
becomes more medicinal than it was at first, always more so than is believable.
This is a secret.
<p>The Stone thus prepared does not make projection on mercury, because
of its non-fusibility, as with this Stone no projection is made except
to the Red on Luna and to the White on tin. Therefore, need be done except
to make the Stone infusible. Enough has been said of this in the Multiplicaton,
how to turn the Stone into Oil, and it is therefore not necessary to say
anything about mercury.
<p>If you wish to work with the oil, and wish to throw it on mercury, take
1 part of mercury, half an ounce of fine silver as it comes from the cupel,
and amalgamate them, 1 lb of mercury for one amalgam. Put this in a glass
crucible, then in an earthenware crucible, set it thus in the fire, and
when it begins to smoke, throw it on your prepared oil of the Stone, previously
prepared and tested with the body in tripode as I have taught in the Multiplication.
<p>And now I will teach you another way. Take some oil of the Red or the
White Stone, and take Sol to the Red, so that 1 part of oil and 10 parts
of Sol come together, as has already been taught before. Pour the oil into
the calx Sol, set it in tripodem in a glass hanging lamp, first with s
small fire, then somewhat stronger, so that you could hardly hold your
hand in the inmost furnace, and keep it thus for 5 or 6 days.
<p>Thereafter increase the fire for 3 days so much that the uppermost or
exterior furnace hisses when touched with a wet finger. Then let it cool
of its own, take it out, break the glass open, and you will find a hard
mass If you wish to make a projection on mercury, put it in a crucible,
take some of this mass, pulverize it and throw it. Then increase the fire
so that your material begins to melt. Let it melt till it results in a
King. Then take it out, let it cool, knock it with a hammer, see it if
is supple, then you have accomplished it and you have good Sol.
<p>And mark! As long as it is brittle like glass, it is still a medicine.
After that, thro it on molten silver, till the silver is supple and sticks
beneath the hammer, then you have good Sol. But as long as it is brittle,
you have not yet reached the end of the projection, be it with the White
or the red oil. Then you must throw it on other metal till it is supple
and has beautiful colors, and can stand all tests. Now you are at the end
of the projection. When the Stone has been made as it should, be it White
or Red, as I have taught in the Multiplication, its projection is infinite,
which is unbelievable, but one can hardly reach the end. But do not do
anything except throw it more and more on metals as long as it remains
supple and passes all tests, as I have taught.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Red and the White Stones</font></b></center>

<p>And coagulate out of clean and white sulfur and out of clean mercury;
therefore coagulate, if they are quite pure, because the Stone, when it
is coagulated, consists of clean white sulfur and pure Mercury. It is therefore
white arsenic, pure and subtle, and it is the purest of all combined things.
When it consists of pure red sulfur, combined with shining arsenic, it
is pure and much subtler than the white arsenic.
<p>Example: If you gave of it 1 part to a horse, the horse would die because
the poison would go to the heart and thereafter to all parts, so that all
flesh and everything there is to the horse would turn to poison, which
would cause it to die. If dogs or birds were to eat of this dead horse,
they would also die, for if such poison can kill a horse, which weighs
so many hundred pounds, all animals that eat this must die also.
<p>Thus our Stone is made of the same things as arsenic, be it white or
red. Nature has cooked it thus for a long time and has drawn out its innermost.
She has turned the materia, which at first was a great poison, back into
a crude medicine, because Sol not only serves as a cure for all diseases
on account of its great balance, but also because of its intermixture with
other substances.
<p>Our Work is made of these two, Sol and Luna, as is customary in the
Work. Take Sol and Luna and undo again what nature has accomplished, that
is, what she has turned into a body in many years. Dissolve it and turn
it back into the prima material, as it was when nature first began to operate.
It will again become arsenic and poison. When it is then extracted by subtle
manipulation and mastery, the matter will become more poisonous than it
was before Nature began to act. If you were to give one lot of this material
to a horse or an ox, they would soon die, because the material is now so
subtle and so very poisonous and hot that it is inexpressible. Thereafter,
the material is sublimated and becomes quite thick, so that the fumes would
unexpectedly kill a man. If you were to put some of this material on a
chair and a an were to sit on it for the duration of 4 or 5 Pater Nosters,
the material would penetrate the man’s body, causing him to die soon. Nor
does there exist such a strong animal in the world, even if it were a big
poisonous dragon, that would not die at once if the fumes touched its body.
<p>That is why the ancients likened the material to a poisonous dragon,
saying that the dragon had eaten its own tail. They also called this material
a snake, and compared it to a snake that impregnates itself. They used
many
other names for it which are too many to write about, all they meant was
the Stone.
<p>Therefore, no poison is found anywhere as strong as this material of
the Stone, because of its subtlety, the heat which it has when it is sublimated.
Then the master with his Philosophical Art causes the poison to be turned
back inward into the innermost of its body. After that, the material possesses
a great medicinal power which lies hidden in its innermost. It is that
which the Master has brought to light by his Art, with the help of God.
<p>When this has been done, its innermost has been brought outside, and
what was outside has gone inside. Understand this also of the horse of
which I have spoken. Such a Stone can do an infinite projection when it
has been brought into its heavenly nature. For if a thing is good outside,
it an do 1,000,000 times more than one that is bad outside. Example: The
Lord God is good outside, the devil bad outside. Who then has more power,
God or the devil? Likewise with our Stone. When it was still poisonous,
how many big animals may it have killed? But after it is made good, how
much good will it do? With its small weight it can always do a thousand
times better, and more than 10, 20, thousand times better than Luna, it
would seem impossible.
<p>Under the green crudeness the blackness lies hidden, and every created
thing has its perfect redness, either white in its innermost or in its
exterior, and between the white and the red there are varied colors, more
than one can imagine. But that which is white on the outside is red within,
and between the two there are many kinds of colors, as said before. The
closer a thing is to is perfection, the fewer colors it has within; and
the simpler it is, the closer it is to its ultimate destination which God
has assigned to it. Then it has no more than one color within it, neither
more in its exterior nor in its interior, but it contains the power of
all the colors which at first manifested within it. For as many colors
as are in a thing, and as much variety there is within it, as many powers
it contains, When the thing has been prepared into a simple perfected substance,
in the uttermost power assigned to it by God, all these powers act together,
like one thing, in a short time, nevertheless miraculously.
<p>There is nothing else in things but a simple essence, and its body is
red, and its interior is outside, and there is no difference in its middle.
Just as it is in its middle, it is in its outside and also in its middle.
Each does its work without ill humor, so to speak, in one moment. For there
is no contrary nature within it which would act against it. It therefore
acts promptly. Likewise our Stone. Wherever it is thrown, a perfect work
is achieved, and in everything it turns the outer inside, and the inside
outside.
<p>Inside Luna is good, Sol is clear red, and when the White Stone is thrown
on mercury, it draws the inmost outside, which turns into white clear silver,
replacing the redness inside. Thus every single thing contains its tincture,
be it white or red, although the Red and the White Stone have no nature
which they could impart, just as it does not happen with the nature of
stones. They do not have it in themselves to do violence, be it white or
red, for God has given each thing its necessaries of life, and each thing
contains enough tincture without necessitating the help of anything else.
And each thing, be it vegetable or animal, contains its own medicine, without
having to add another thing, to enable it to recover of itself. If it were
not so, God’s Work would not be perfect. All the things He has created
have never lacked anything. They do not require help from other things,
as they have in themselves everything they need, although we do not understand
this completely. God has not forgotten anything in anything He has created.
Nor is anything lacking in any leaf that grows out of the earth, although
we do not perceive the perfection which is contained therein. But by the
mastery of this Art we can draw out of each thing its occult nature and
make manifest what is hidden in it, and hide what is manifest. That is
what our Stone does in the white and red metals.
<p>In the perfection of the red and white metals the Stone has no tincture,
because the tincture which thus unites the Stone is with the Elements,
so that there is one body and one substance which cannot be separated.
For this is a heavenly nature, like the invincible heaven where all planets
are sanding, Each according to its nature takes its influence from it and
imparts to the things of the lower world, as we can daily see with our
eyes, through the forces of the sun. Flowers grow in many different colors
and varied fragrances, and all this is due to the warmth of the sun.
<p>Do you believe that the world bestows color and fragrance to flowers
and plants from its own body? No, not at all, but it is a heavenly nature
that possesses so much power and influence that it draws out color, smell,
and taste of the seed from which plants and flowers grow. Therefore. Although
the sun were shining for a hundred years, it would not infuse either color,
smell, or taste, but God has poured them into the seed. All this is locked
inside the seed, and even if the sun were never to shine upon it, it would
nevertheless get color, small, and taste. The sun is a heavenly body and
it has the power to draw out by its heat and innermost in the seed and
to manifest it on the outside; smell, taste, and color. The seed grows
into its perfection, and it may thereafter grow superabundantly to the
end of the world, but smell, taste and color do not separate from its body.
<p>More or less, it is also thus with our white or Red Stone. It does not
give any of its own tincture or body to our metals, as it is a heavenly
body, just as has been said of the sun. It draws the tincture out of the
metals and causes them to reach their extreme power, so that they can turn
into seed and produce the Stone thereof. If God had not created full powers
in the metals, no change would occur even if you threw the Stone a thousand
times on them, because the Stone cannot give what it has not.
<p>I have written that the Stone can be made with many things, and just
as the ruby then keeps the name of the ruby, those things will keep their
own names. It is nothing but the Stone that is one with crystal-glass.
The Stone is only a transposer from bad to good, from the impure to the
pure, of everything that is like itself, not in all things but strictly
only in metals.

<p><b><font size=+1>A Right and Perfect Medicine of the Other Order,</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>To Cleanse Copper of All Impurities</font></b></center>

<p>Take copper, 20 or 30 lb, beat it into thin lamellae, 5 or 6 times annealed
and slaked in urine to make it beautiful and clear, and laminated thinly
like pennies. When it is annealed, there must not be left any scales or
impurity. It must be clear and red. Thereafter, dry it well with a cloth
and then in the sun or near the fire. After this, take good pulverizes
white auripigment, powder it finely on the Stone with oil, like black soap.
Coat the copper sheets with it and dry them near the fire. Coat and dry
them again, and do this 4 or 5 times. Now take common salt, called pore
salt, pulverize it, stratify it in a crucible, the crucible completely
filled, then lute the crucible. Do the same with the other crucibles, as
many as you wish. Put them in a calcination furnace, first with a small
fire, then with a stronger, but keep it up till they glow through and through.
Let them stand thus in the red-hot heat for 24 hours, then let them cool,
take them out, edulcorate the laminae with warm water to make them lose
any taste of salt. Now dry them well and pound or rub them finely, like
paint.
<p>Keep at hand 2 or 3 big cupels, it must be cups, put the laminae into
them and pour clean water on the matter, stir it well, let it sink, pour
it off again, to the first water, and continue doing this till the matter
is clear. Then dry the powder and mix it with sal alkali, borax, and (|),
put it in a sack such as is here illustrated, filling it completely. Sew
it together and stick a small wooden spigot into it. Lute the sack all
around with good glue, as thick as two fingers’ breadth, so that the glue
can stand the fire. Let it dry well, set it in a furnace on two irons,
put a crucible underneath it at the place where you have stuck the spigot,
and stir the fire in the hearth strongly. The matter will easily melt and
flow into te crucible. Continue doing this till all your powder has been
turned into one body. Thereafter weigh it and add to every ounce one 3j
of fine Luna as it comes out of the cupel. Smelt it together in a big crucible,
pour it into a strong mold, and your body is ready and alive, and prepared
for the medicine of the second order and effect, according to the teachings
of Hermes and Geber.

<p><b><font size=+1>Ad Rubeum</font></b></center>

<p>There were some artists who took Roman vitriol, 1 lb, calx of Saturn,
and mercury sublimated to the Red, 1 lb, vitriol 1 oz, ad pondus omnius.
Prepare of these an AF to the White, as said above, and when the water
has been thus made, extract the salt from the Death’s head as before, keep
the water and the salt each separate till they are needed. Then take 1
lb of mercury, sublimate it through 3 lb of dry vitriol and rub it also
so the second time among the faeces on the stone. The third time, take
fresh vitriol and sublimate it. Do this three times, and the mercury will
have been sublimated 9 times and be well prepared.
<p>Now take 1 lb of calx of Saturn, calcined so much with vinegar or in
the sun that it becomes impalpable. Mix it with the salt of the Death’s
Head and proceed immediately as with the oil to the White, except that
this one must stand much longer in the fire than the White. The fire must
also be stronger or the fixation of the oil. In other respects the manipulations
o the opus are everywhere the same. Test to see if it is fixed, and when
it is fixed, you have a great secret. Here no purification or ablution
occurs, because the faeces consume themselves, and an oil will remain eternally,
somewhat subtler than honey. This oil cannot be turned into a Stone like
those made with Aqua Vitae. Here too, many corrosives are contained within,
and it should be noted that the Sol made with this oil and transmuted out
of imperfect metals cannot be used for any medicine.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Another Oil to the Red from AF and Saturn</font></b></center>

<p>There were other artists who took vitriol 3 lb, saltpeter 2 lb, and
prepared of it an AF. They pulverized the Death’s Head and put it in a
glass, added an alembic wit a hole and poured the water back on it, then
drew it off again with strong fire and kept it. Then they took 1 lb of
lead, and 2 lb of mercury, amalgamated both and dissolved it again, set
it in the balneum, drew it off, poured it on again, and continued doing
this till the matter turned into a red oil and no longer coagulated.
<p>Then they also took 1 oz of Sol, dissolved it in AR, and poured it on
the red oil, shook it between their hands and mixed it well, set it in
sand, and again drew the AF off. Then they sealed the glass as well as
possible, set it in the tripod, gave it as much fire as is used for keeping
lead in flux. They continued doing this till the oil was fixed. This oil,
1 part to 8, tinges into a most perfect oil which can stand all tests.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>A Precious Oil to the Red</font></b></center>

<p>Dear Sons, you should know the following and consider it a great secret.
Take 3 lb of Vitriol Virid. Aer., Plumbum Album an. 5 lb, Croci Pulv. Lapidis
Haematite 3j 4. Saltpeter ad pondus omnium. Crush them so that they mingle
thoroughly; divide them into three parts. From one of the parts, make an
AF; in a glass vessel and no other kind of vessel. After this, pour it
on the other part of the matter (a second part) and draw it over on a strong
fire. Pour this now onto the third part of the matter and keep this water
well closed.
<p>Pulverize the Death’s Head and rub them with ammonia * water, which
I will each later on, on a marble, till they are quite small, as if one
wished to paint with the matter. Let it dry in a room or by the sun; grind
it once again and put it into an alembic. Pour your water on it, draw it
off again, first with a gentle fire for 24 hours; then gradually with stronger
fire, till the matter begins to glow. After this, keep it in a steady glow
for 6 weeks. Then let it cool down, remove it and preserve it.
<p>After this, take the Death’s Head and the remaining faeces. Powder them
and moisten with vinegar and draw off its salt as you know how to do, so
that no faces stay behind. When your salt is clear, pour the AF on it,
give it gentle heat on sand or on ashes for 12 hours. Follow this with
stronger heat for 6 hours, so that it will glow mildly. Then let it cool
off. Take the water in the recipient and close it well. Again rub the faeces
with vinegar, and afterwards dissolve it in vinegar; put it in the balneum.
Do as you have been instructed before and see it if produces faeces. Coagulate
it and pour the AF back on it. Draw it off, Repeat 3 or 4 times and the
salt together with the water will go over the helm.
<p>Do believe me that I have worked wonder with this water, which cannot
be described here. I have personally turned this water into a red crystal
which gave off a light at night by which a whole table of people could
see enough to eat their meal by. Keep it until you need it, and consider
it a treasure of all waters.
<p>More so take Merc. Praeparati of its humidity, for each pound of mercury,
2 pounds of vitrioli Romani and sublime it therewith. Mix it again with
the faeces and for the third time, take fresh vitriol and sublime it again.
Do this 4 or 5 times, the more times the better. After this, the mercury
is ready. Take then, one ounce of sol, thinly beaten and cut into rolls.
Dissolve it into the AF which you have made, and set it into a basin with
sifted ashes. Put the basin into a kettle filled with very warm water,
and in an hour the mercury will dissolve.
<p>Take one ounce of the sublimated mercury, dissolve it also in this water.
After this, throw another ounce of your mercury in and let this also dissolve.
Then it is enough as you will have 3 ounces of matter dissolved in it,
1 oz of Sol and 2 oz of mercury. Now put a helm on together with a recipient,
draw the water off, pour it back on again until it will no longer go over
in balneo. Let it cool down and put it on a furnace and ashes. Continue
this so long as the water will go over. In this distillation you will see
wonders, because you will see all the colors of the whole world in the
helm. The colors are in the spirit and the corpus keeps the spirit in it
and with it. The colors are covered in the corpus as you will learn in
Vegetabili. Search for it in Chapter 93.
<p>When no more drops are coming, let it cool down, remove the helm and
close the glass well above. Set it in tripode for 40 days; the heat should
be such that you can easily keep you hand in the furnace. Your matter will
become fixed within this time, and when it is cold, it will be hard as
glass. As soon as it gets near heat that will melt like wax, it flows as
if it were wax or as an oil. This is a perfect Lapis Compositus, and no
foreign things have been added to it which are not part of its kind or
species. My child should not that at least one part of this Stone falls
on 1000 parts or more. I myself have worked in his area and have accomplished
the operation one time. It is such a beautiful Stone to behold and shines
so much at night that one does not have a need for light. This is why it
is such an excellent Medicine and a noble Stone and should be considered
a great Secretum.
<br>The Water Salis Armon., with which the above mentioned powder is to
be rubbed or ground, is made in the following way. Take one lb of *; 2
lb of vitriol and sublimate them together. And again mix the matter with
the faeces. For the third time, take fresh vitriol and sublimate this also
4 times, Grind this sublimated * to powder, put it into a glass, pour distilled
vinegar upon it, just enough vinegar to dissolve it and no more. Now the
water is as yellow as Sol when it has been sublimed through Vitriol. The
Vitriol acetum destillatum produces the Tincture of Sol. This then is the
water which you must rid you Death’s head, as indicated above, which is
to be imbibed with this * Water. It gives good Ingress.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Salts of the Metals</font></b></center>

<p>Up to now, dear Son, you have heard how you are to proceed with and
handle the great Work with Amalgamations and with certain Olea. Now you
will hear how to make salts out of the metals that can also produce a perfect
Elixir, as good as the Olea, although its projection is not as high. It
is an easy work, however, and takes but a short time. After that, I will
teach you how to make the Stone, which I consider my greatest Secretum.
<p>Look for further instructions in the Vegetabili. This is the reason
why it is necessary to preserve the green of the Vitriol. If you were to
coagulate it, part of its greenness would be taken from it; for it would
become yellow, wile yet the green is in the Quintesentia that we seek in
the Vitriol. That is why you must permit it to dry and sprout in a room.
Then its greenness is covered with the white, for as soon as it becomes
moist again, its greenness will reappear, This the outermost of the Vitriol
must be turned into the innermost, and the innermost must come out, in
order to preserve its soul and its spirit and to retain its Quinta Essentia.
This is a great Mysterium or Secretum in our Art. When the Vitriol has
thus been cleansed, it is as red as a rose or ruby. It has within itself
the four elements in the perfection, and this is the stone which God has
given us for nothing.
<p>You should now take the white powder which you were told to put aside
and place it in a phial and close it with Sigillo hermetis. Set it in ashes
and heat it by a lamp, as warm as the sun shines in the midst of summer.
Keep it thus, until you see that it begins to turn yellow. Let it stand
yet another ten days and see if it dies not begin to tinge a red color.
Then, increase the fire a little, and if it becomes more red, let it stand
in the regimen of the fire as is. If, however, it does not become somewhat
redder in 8-10 days, increase the fire by one lamp until the color increases.
If it stays the same, add yet another lamp, thus each time increasing the
heat by degrees until the color changes to a rose or ruby red.
<p>When it has become a high or deep red color, let it stand yet another
8-10 days in the same heat and watch if the color does not change into
a color different than red. Now the matter has been reversed and its innermost
has been brought outside. In this way, you will not lose the greenness
if it has been reversed into redness. This is because it is in the deepest
inner parts and can no more be brought out. It will forever stay red and
unfixed; for if it were fixed, everything would be lost, because it would
have to be dissolved in water and coagulated again, and afterwards distilled
over the helm.
<p>I am telling you that I have never revealed to you greater secrets than
this! I am telling you, by my God, that this Secret has never been set
down into writing by the philosophi except by my hand alone. Moreover,
I am telling you that there is no greater secret in art than this. Therefore,
I beseech you and all those who will understand it, that you will never
bring it to light except where it is right to reveal it, by the damnation
of your soul, for it is a Secret above all Secrets. Since with this matter
all metals can be turned into oil, when they are dissolved in AF, when
the calx has been beaten to the bottom and processed as required.
<p>All Olea Metallorum turn red as blood, without Luna and [ … ] not lead,
for all metals are red in their innermost, but one is redder than the other.
When they have been brought to redness, you must dissolve them, again coagulate
them until they are free from all faeces and they have their elements perfectly
joined; for once they have arrived at this stage, nothing is left but faces.
The earth, too, has become subtle and liquid and is dissolved in the other
three.
<p>When they have thus been made subtle, with dissolving and coagulating,
you can distill it over the helm to a red oil, as you will learn. As you
are working with Vitriol, you must also treat mercury. After it has been
dissolved in AF, beaten down, decanted from its saltiness and dried, you
can put it in a glass the same as has been done with the Vitriol. Or you
can put a Sublimated Mercury into such a glass, proceed in the same way
and cleanse it of its faeces, and distill it over into a red oil. In the
same way copper can be processed. What do you think? Is this not a great
Secret? Never before has anything like it been heard. Open your ears therefore,
listen and understand!
<p>Now we will return to our work. When you see that your matter remains
in an Oily state, take it out of the ashes and put it into another, strong
glass. Pour a goodly amount of wine vinegar upon it, and set it into the
balneum to boil for 4 days, often stirring it with a wooden spoon. After
the fourth day, let it cool down and settle. Decant off the clear liquid
and pour more vinegar upon the remaining faeces. Add more distilled vinegar,
and repeat three times. Now throw away the faeces and put an alembic upon
the glass containing the solution; draw off the vinegar, so that the matter
becomes quite dry. Now you have the matter at the bottom of the glass and
much more beautiful than before. Again, pour fresh vinegar upon it, and
treat it as above. Reiterate this until no more faeces remain in the Solution.
Then coagulate it to a dry powder, put a helm on it with a large head and
distill. First you will obtain a yellow spiritus, then red oils and finally
a white spiritus. Let the matter cool down, remove the receiver and its
contents. It is the blessed oil. Preserve it well until you need it for
your metallic salt.
<p>At the bottom of the alembic you will find a matter that is as white
as snow and is clear as crystal. It is the rectified matter of the aforesaid
material. It can be pulverized and imbibed into the red oil as into its
own corpus. Put it in vitreum apullam and hang it in tripodem for 40 days
in moderate heat. Now it will coagulate into a Lapis Philosophorum which
will dissolve all metals into Sol. But we will not do this now, but will
work toward our Salt and Oil of metals in this manner, as with Vitriol.
Thus the element of earth will go over with the oil, red as blood. This
the earth of Vitriol does not do, as its oil separates from the earth.
Consequently God has given it such benediction that from it alone can one
make the Lapis Philosophorum without any Addition. But first one has to
fix the oil with its earth. That does not happen in metals, because their
earth goes over the helm together with the fire, and the whole body reverses,
which tinges the metals into perfect Sol.
<p>By the same process, you can make the Oil of Mercury and Copper, and
the earth also goes over the helm in the oil and stays in the oil for all
eternity. With this oil, you can perform such miracles as would be too
lengthy to recount here. You well know what is said about the oil Veneris.
Yet the oil from mercury is much better in its effects than the oil Veneris.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now We will Return to Our Work of the Salts and Prepare
Them into Oil with the Help of Oil of Vitriol and Their Mercury Sublimated
from Them.</font></b></center>

<p>Take the Mercury and dissolve it in AF, made of equal parts of vitriol
and salt peter. Then put it in a glass retort, add a big alembic, put it
in sifted ashes, and make a small fire underneath. Distill the AF off,
and increase the fire to let the Mercury distill. Let it cool and take
the Mercury out. Put it in a long-necked glass, just as you do with Vitriol.
Put it in a long-necked glass, just as you do with Vitriol. Set it in ashes,
make a lamp-fire underneath, and let it stand thus till it is perfectly
red. Dissolve and coagulate it, as has been taught regarding the vitriol.
When it is clean, distill it to a red oil, not leaving any faeces behind.
All metals are processed in the same way as has been taught about Mercury.
<p>When the oil of mercury has been drawn over, put your salt and elixir
of (-) in a big retort over a gentle heat, to allow the salt to melt. This
will happen easily as soon as the heat is such the wax would melt. When
it is melted, pour the oil of mercury into it by drops, and they will immediately
conjoin as they are pure and clean.
<p>Now you have conjoined Soul and Body in One. They will never again separate,
because here the Body receives its own Spirit and fixes it in one moment.
Let the glass stand thus on the furnace for 16 to 26 days, in gentle heat,
just as if you were to keep wax in flux, without foam. Within this time
the substance will be converted into oil which looks like thick honey or
like dark red blood, and it will remain thus forever. Now rejoice, my children,
you have the secret of all secrets. It does projection in Sol at the rate
of 1 part to 1000.
<p>If you intend to make a projection, you must know that you must do it
on a body and not on mercury, because the oil would not turn Mercury into
a Body for reasons that are not explained here, as they are sufficiently
indicated in the treatise on projection. You must take a red-hot copper
or silver, or antimony sheet, dribble the oil upon it, and put it on hot
coal. The oil will permeate it like water a sponge, and it will be changed
into Sol, which can stand all tests.
<p>It does not effect any projection on tin and lead, because the medicine
must first disembody the bodies, changing them into its own natures, before
it can change them into a Corpus. We will not speak about this here, as
it is sufficiently explained elsewhere. What do you think of this secret?
Never has anything like it been found in the world.
<p>You have heard how and why you must dissolve the metals and beat them
down again into calx, and how you must edulcorate the calx of the AF and
sublimate its Mercury, and dissolve the salt in vinegar, then rectify it
of its faeces, and how it must afterwards be calcined in a sealed glass
to its perfect redness, then dissolved in vinegar, the faeces discarded
which it has in it inmost redness and which at first did not let go of
it till its innermost had been brought to the outside.
<p>For you must know that everything contains two kinds of faeces. First,
in its crudeness, when it was still raw, as when you first dissolved and
coagulated vitriol, it was still green and without faeces, but now that
it turns red and is again dissolved, it leaves faeces which had not been
noticed before. Now someone might ask: How is it that the innermost does
not let for of its faeces, although the whole material is clear water?
Understand this as follows: When the material is dissolved, it is all outside,
and it locks the heat within so that it cannot let go of it. But when the
heat is brought out and then dissolved, it opens of its own and lets go
of its faces --- while they are not overcome by the cold. Therefore, you
must rectify twice if you wish to prepare a proper Elixir or Quinta Essentia,
no matter with what material you are working, spirits, rocks, roots, sugar,
honey, etc. And I swear to you by God that such a Secret has never been
revealed, nor has anything been written about it except by myself alone,
by my hand.
<p>Furthermore, you have also heard how vitriol has to be set to distill,
and that oil, red as blood, will go over and the earth be left behind,
which is thereafter to be imbibed into its oil and set in the tripod.
<p>In addition, I instructed you to preserve the oil carefully. Moreover,
I told you to dissolve Mercury in AF, beat it down, edulcorate it, dry
it, put it in vitriol, again imbibe its Corpus with it to turn it all into
oil and cause it to achieve projection. I have told you that all metals
can be worked in this way and turned into oil without separating the elements.
Dear Sons, consider all the words that I have written about this Work,
because you stand greatly in need of understanding this well.
<p>I have taught you how you should draw all metals per alembicum, so that
they go over without any Death’s Head. This is achieved by the strong spirit
of vinegar, completely rectified and separated from all its faces inside
and outside. When the metals have thus been opened and made subtle, and
their innermost is outside, their Elements cannot be separated, and even
if you tried everything in the world, you could not part them because of
their subtlety and purity. For when they have with them the subtle spirit
of vinegar, they go with it through the alembic. If, however, you put them
near the fire when there is no spirit of vinegar with them, they congeal
together. But while the vinegar is in their pure and subtle Corpus, they
turn into oil and congeal the spirit of vinegar with them. Know that the
spirit of vinegar is the subtlest spirit in the world, 1000 times subtler
than the spirit of brandy. It cannot be kept in any vessel, but if it is
already half-fixed, it congeals easily together with the materia to which
it is added, as is proven in the Vegetable Work, where wine and its nature
are being discussed. There you are also taught what the spirit of the distilled
vinegar is, and how it dissolves all things.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Now We Shall Tell You, Dear Children How to Multiply
the Philosophical Oil</font></b></center>

<p>Take the Philosophical Oil, put it in a big retort. On 1 part pour 100
parts of oil of vitriol, lute and close it tightly above, set it in ashes,
and light a fire underneath it, as hot as if you were to keep wax melting,
without foaming. Keep it thus continually for 6 weeks, and it will congeal
during this time. It will make as good and high a projection as the first
did.
<p>Read this over often and bear it in mind, as you will need it for other
things, for in this lies hidden the foundation of all arts. But if you
wish to draw a good oil out of the metals, as is taught in connection with
vitriol, you must dissolve your metal in AF, beat it down, dry and coagulate
it, put it in a phial, set it in ashes, and proceed with the regulation
of the fire as is taught of vitriol, till it is quite red. Now dissolve
it in distilled vinegar and coagulate it till no more faeces are left.
Then set it to distill, and the metal will completely turn into oil. It
is a perfect Philosophical Oil, though its projection is not as high as
that of the first oil prepared from salt. You must multiply all metal oils
with oil of vitriol, as it is taught, and in this way you can make much
oil, and its projection is quite high. Thank God and do not misuse His
gifts, for the sake of your soul’s salvation.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Purification and Separation of the Metals from Their
Faeces</font></b></center>

<p>Know that there are three ways of separating a thing from its faeces.
The first way is the way of Nature herself, for nature discards everything
that is imperfect, as may be seen every day, when everything buried in
the earth it turned into earth --- which her means. Look at all the roofs
that are standing in the air, be they made of iron, steel, lead, wood,
or stone, or anything else, exposed to the air day and night --- it deteriorates
and turns into nothing with the passage of time, be it fortresses or castles.
No matte how strong you are, they are all calcined into earth as their
middle degree. But someone might ask: Why not also into air, water, or
fire? Know that everything that is here below the circle of Luna is composed
of the four Elements, and all the four Elements are impure and full of
faeces. Also, one Element is impurer than another, as is reported in the
Vegetable Work. Among them, Earth is the impurest and driest Element, containing
the most faeces. That is why all things must first be converted into earth
before turning them into Air, Water, or Fire. It has to be so, because
Nature does not act except from degree to degree. No one can move from
the beginning to the end before suffering the middle which lies between
them. You can therefore not reach the fourth degree before passing the
second and the third. Whoever does not understand this, is advised not
to work in our Art. Thus all things that are purified according to the
course of Nature first change into Earth. When a thing is transformed into
Earth, it is open, and each Element can be extracted, as is proven in the
Vegetable Work. If a thing is to be transformed from the first degree into
the second, it is necessary to transform it into another nature --- unless
it has first become Earth. This is so on account of the faeces contained
in it.
<p>Take the example of lead. When you stir it on the fire, it must first
turn into Earth or ashes before becoming glass. For lead cannot become
glass, it must first be earth. This is due to the faeces contained in it.
You can make Luna of lead, but it must first become glass, as is taught
in many places. Saturn can also be turned into Luna in other ways of its
faeces are removed, as is sufficiently taught elsewhere, for lead is Luna
in its innermost, and nothing is required except that its faeces separated
from it, also its sulphur, which is earthy. Then it is good Luna like that
which Nature transforms every day, as may be seen.
<p>Look at the old chapels formerly covered with lead --- which may have
covered them for 600 years. It has been transformed into earth and laid
white on the lead. One can see it every day on the old lead roofs. It jumps
off in the form of small slates, and if it were to stay there still longer,
Nature would finally cook and purify it. I myself have seen that when such
an old roof covered with lead --- and about 2000 years old --- was dismantled,
it was as white as if it had been calcined, and when it was broken into
pieces, it looked like filed silver. When it was put on the cupel with
other lead, everything together was good silver. Thus Nature had purified
it by long digestion, and consumed and destroyed all its faeces, like the
dust of the sun.
<p>As an example use a big jar measuring 10 or 12 quarts. Fill it with
water, and when the sun is shining, put it in the air day and night. Close
it tightly to prevent any air or rain from entering it. The water will
become evil-smelling, impure, slimy, and of a bitter taste. In time the
taste will consume and destroy itself. The faeces or earthly material in
the water will be separated from the watery substance and sink to the bottom.
The water will become beautiful and clear as if it were distilled, and
it will again be sweet and fragrant Then pour it off into a fine glass,
let it stand thus for some time, and it will produce more faeces. Pour
it off again, and continue doing this till no more faeces are found at
the bottom. Now the water is rectified. And if it were to stand till Doomsday,
it would no longer be corrupted.
<p>The same applies to the oils. If they were left standing for several
years, they would become clear of all faeces, just as has been said of
the water.
<p>See also how old wine or old beer being well preserved and stoppered
discards its faeces and yeast. Take some old wine purified of its mother
--- how vigorous and strong it is. And if it were left tightly closed for
several years, it would purify itself, so that one would finally find neither
faeces nor yeast in it. In time it would become like crystal and red as
a ruby and without any faeces. Further details in the Vegetable Work.
<p>Secondly. There is still another way of purifying everything that contains
faeces. It is done by the Art. Consequently, the Art comes to the Aid of
nature. It is done by dissolving and coagulating, as is partly explained
in the Great Work. I will therefore not write more about the separation
and purification of the faeces. You will find further information in the
Vegetable Work at the place where the rectification of metals is dealt
with.
<p>Thirdly. My Child must know that there exists still another rectification
for separating the faeces from all metals and minerals. It is done by fire.
We will only say as much about this rectification as is necessary. You
will also find clearer instructions in the vegetable Work, in connection
with the manufacture of precious stones and gems.
<p>Therefore, know that all metals can be cleansed of their faeces by fire,
when the elements stay completely together without being separated. Afterwards
they can be fixed, and all this is done by fire. It can be done in many
ways. Sol must be calcined differently fro Luna; and Luna must be worked
differently from lead, and copper differently from antimony. My Child must
know that two kinds of calcinations can be done with metals, one by cementing
--- which will be discussed later in its treatise --- and one with salt
and mineral spirits, without converting the metals into glass, and yet
one is different from the other.
<p>All metals are turned into glass without any additive, except only Sol,
which does not turn into glass even if it were burnt to Doomsday. Something
has to be added which the others do not require, because Sol is pure by
nature. Yet it contains a few faeces, though not so many that they would
cover the Corpus. No matter how strongly it is burnt, the faeces will not
turn into glass. It would rather burn up completely and turn into nothing
before becoming glass. That, however, is not the case with the other metals
which would of course become glass. Now someone might ask: If a thing has
become glass, has it reached its extreme state? Because when a thing has
turned into glass, it cannot be converted into any other materia, because
glass is the extreme form of all things. At Doomsday, everything below
the sky will be converted into glass, as God has ordained. Therefore it
is clear that glass is the ultimate matter of all things and cannot be
turned into anything else by the Art, except a burnt-out material or faces.
<p>I have often seen that glass was turned into black slag, like iron slag,
by long and strong burning; and by still longer burning it became white
ash, light as dust, so that it flew away and the glass came to nothing.
This it would appear that glass is the ultimate matter of all things, metallic
things not excepted. It is the primary substance of all combustible things.
Therefore the mild and natural moisture separate from the earth by strong
burning, while from metals and minerals the oil does not separate from
the earth in the fire but always stays together with it. If the oil would
leave the earth and the metallic salts were fusible, how then could they
give ingress and tinctures?
<p>Know then that if salt is extracted from the metals and is prepared
as it should, there may well result no tincture, but it does projection
to the White. The reason is: The oil is locked in the salt like the yellow
in the egg. If you wish to make a red tincture, the fire or the oil must
be brought outside, and its salt or earth brought inside. Then it will
make projection to the Red, just as it had previously made to the White.
Before, 1 part fell on 100, now it is 1 part to 1000. And yet it is only
one and the same material, only its innermost has been brought outside.
<p>But someone might ask: If the salt or oil is extracted from the metals
by means of the fire, its mercury or air I separated from the earth and
the oil --- how then can the salt of oil ive ingress, when the Philosophers
say that the air gives ingress, the fire the tincture, the oil melts, the
earth congeals --- yet here the air has flown away due to the long heat
of the fire?
<p>Know that enough air has remained with the oil I the fire, that is,
as much as is necessary, because the Elements are so well conjoined that
you can never separate them. They stay mixed together --- no fire is found
without air, nor air without fire. In addition, earth and fire are two
fixed elements; that is why they retain as much air as they require to
make ingress.
<p>How then is it, someone might say, that all metals turn into glass,
except Sol? The reason is that all metals are impure and full of faeces.
That is why they are calcined, as all metallic parts are full of sulfurous
faeces which easily overcome them in the ores. When they are put in a mighty
fire, they are easily calcinced, and the moisture of the fat sulphurous
faeces burns up. The faeces became so dry that the whole metal converts
into earth and calx, and if they did not change into calx, they could never
become glass, because they have to be calx first.
<p>Nothing can be changed into another nature except by some means. While
it had been metal before, now it is glass --- indeed two natures. If it
is to be done, it must be done by a means, which is the earth or the calx
of the metal. By strong and long calcinations it is converted into glass,
as is taught in the counterfeiting o stones. And when the stones are counterfeited,
they look ten times more beautiful and clearer than oriental ones.
<p>For look at the Amusen which are mixed with them, how beautiful green,
blue, yellow, red, and white they are, and one is more beautiful and precious
than the other. They still consists of metal only. How then is it that
one is more beautiful and precious than another, also more fusible? In
this connection you must know: When the metal is calcined and is then put
in the vaulted furnace or the reverberatory, it requires strong heat before
it changes into beautifully clear and transparent glass and before the
faeces are cleared. The more it is cleared, the more beautiful and fusible
it becomes. And you must know that the glass made in this way is like a
glorious Corpus, while before it had been a black impure Corpus, and under
this Corpus lies hidden the noble Quinta Essentia of the metal. The latter
is incombustible, shining with its lovely color till Judgment Day. Its
soul, therefore, is in a glorified Corpus, just like a light in a crystal
lantern, and one soul shines much brighter than another.
<p>Therefore you must know that the Quinta Essentia or the incombustible
oil of the metal together with its clear salt shine out of the metallic
glass like a candle out of a lantern, and the more beautiful it is, the
more easily it flows. Furthermore, you must understand that when the metal
is calcined and the master wishes to prepare a green Amausen from it, it
must be made with Venus. And if he wishes to have a beautiful green in
color and clarity over everything green, he must rub the calx on a marble
slab with salt water till it is impalpable. Thereafter it is washed again
till no earthly rot comes off. Now burn some glass from it, and it will
be a beautiful Amausen which will melt more easily than if you had rubbed
and washed it. The same is to be done with the other kinds of calx, such
as that of lead and copper. They result in a yellow glass, tin in white
glass, silver blue, gold red, and if you wish to obtain other kinds of
calx, mix them with another color.
<p>Now someone might ask: When the metals have thus turned into glass,
and while glass is the ultimate matter of things, can it again be changed
into a Corpus? Know then that it can easily be turned back into a Corpus,
because there had been little calcinations. Every metal can easily be turned
into glass or Amausen within 12 hours in a reverbaration furnace, because
the metallic calx is not yet opened. When the earth has been extracted,
the material is dry. The more rotten and impure the metal is, such as copper,
the dryer the calx is. When it makes contact with the heat of the flames,
there s nothing or very little of a metallic nature that can escape. And
while the Corpus is not yet opened, the strong fire forces it to turn into
glass. Thus the mercury of the metals cannot escape anywhere. Before it
can rise out of the dry calx, the faeces have already become glass.
<p>That is why in many works where it has to be reverberated, it is calcined
by not giving it stronger heat than to make it glow, because if the fire
were stronger, it would turn into glass. Note further: Take the Amausen
and powder them finely. Take some good distilled vinegar in which ammoniac
is dissolved --- in 1 lb of vinegar 1 Lot of *. Rub the glass with it on
a stone as you do with paint. Thereafter put it in a glass or stone jar,
pour on it a good amount of distilled vinegar, set it in the Balneum, and
let it boil, stirring frequently. Let it stand thus a day and night, and
let it cool, pour the vinegar off the faeces into a clean jar. Again pour
fresh vinegar on these faces, and do this three times. Now the vinegar
off by the alembic, and the Corpus of the metals is left at the bottom
of the glass in the form of a powder. Mix it with borax, put it in a crucible,
and melt it with a strong fire into a Corpus. If it is iron or copper,
it is beautiful and pure, does not leave any slag, nor does it rust, and
it is rid of all faeces. If it is tin, its imperfection has been removed
from it, and it is pure and strong like silver. If it is silver, it is
fixed; if gold, it is a medicine; if lead, it is silver, etc.
<p>But in so doing, nothing useful has been produced, except that Nature
is being researched. I have seen that 1 3j of the red Amausen has been
given for 20 Ducats; 3jj of the blue for 20 Ducats; of the green for 8
ducats, and of the others 1 3j for 2 ducats.
<p>It is therefore not necessary to turn it back into a Corpus. It is part
of the subtle art of making Amausen and it goes fast, requiring little
time if they are made of the red calx of copper, lead, tin, and iron, and
they can be sold for 1 Ducat a lb. But if the calx is purified as taught
in the Vegetable Work, precious stones can be made of it, which can be
turned into drinking cups for Princes and vessels for Kings and Lords.
Consequently, the metals are purified by calcining and reverbarating, the
calx is washed, then is turned back into a Corpus, again calcined and washed
till no more faeces comes off.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Commentary</font></b></center>

<p>Know further that there is still another way of calcining. It is called
cementation, which is a calcinations. But there is a difference, because
in the common calcinations you take prepared salt of gem and metal laminae,
and stratify both till the crucible is full. Then the crucible is well
luted and set n the fire in natural heat. If it is copper, 2 days; if it
silver, 24 hours; if it is tin, 8 days; if it is lead, 2 days, etc. This
is the way to calcine.
<p>The <i>modus caementatis</i>, the way to cement, however, is like the
above, but the difference is that it is aided by mineral spirits which
help the fire burn the metals and reduce them to calx. It is also done
in order to give the Body a tincture to make it melt more easily. Mix the
spirits with the prepared salt, then proceed in the previous manner. I
have indicated this so that you may well understand the regimen of the
metals in the fire. There are still many more ways for bringing the metals
to perfection by the fire, which it is not necessary to know for our present
work. You may read about them in the Vegetable Book, Chap 6.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Philosophers’ Stone</font></b></center>

<p>Now I will teach you a work which I have done with my own hands, and
it is an easy Work to carry out, without much effort and worry. It is one
of my secrets, and whoever cannot prepare this Work, will never accomplish
anything in the Art. For here I teach what the Philosophers call Mercury,
and how it is to be extracted from the Corpus, also other secrets which
will be disclosed in the Work, and how to separate and congeal the faeces
of Sol and Luna by fire, then amalgamate them with Mercury, and change
them in a short time into the Philosophers’ Stone. First I will teach you
how to prepare Sol and Luna to give Mercury a Body, ten how to conjoin
tem in the Work.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Fixation of Luna</font></b></center>

<p>First, you must take fine Luna from the cupel and fine Sol at your discretion.
Beat them into thin laminae as thick as an Orint and half a hand wide.
To Luna add prepared sal gemmae and auripigment for the White, sublimated
with + and an equal amount of Lapis Calaminaris. Through 3 lb of that sublimate
1 lb of auripigment is ready. Now take 3j of the auripigment to 1 lb of
prepared salt and 3ij of white calcined tartar, which must be quite clear
and transparent. Mix everything well together with this powder, put layer
upon layer in a good crucible with silver laminae, as you know, the thickness
of a finger. Lute it well and set it to calcine in moderate heat, so that
the silver does not melt. Let it stand thus for 36 hours, then let it cool,
and break the crucible open. The Luna is black and brittle like glass.
Now take clean water and wash the blackness and saltiness off from the
silver, let it dry, and pound it in a mortar. Then rub it well with distilled
water, take a glass bowl and put the pulverized silver into it. Wash it
well with clean water and let it sit for some time or pour it off into
another glass. Pour fresh water on the powder, sir it and wash it off into
another glass. Pour fresh water on the powder, stir it and wash it till
the water runs off as clear as it was when you poured it on. Now the silver
is washed and is as white as snow. If you believe that some of it has gone
back into the water, dry and melt it again, and you will get the remaining
silver back.
<p>Now take the white-washed silver, reduce it with borax, laminate it
again and cement it pulverized, wash and melt it again as before, and continue
doing this till the silver stays white in the cement and no rottenness
or blackness comes off it when it is washed. In this way the silver gets
rid of all its faces without being separated. Try this in the following
way: Dissolve 3j of this silver in rectified wine or Quinta Essentia, coagulate
and dissolve it again, and you will not find any faeces, even if you repeated
it a hundred times.
<p>What do you think of this secret? It is a great secret in the Art. I
am telling you truly, it is the greatest secret of all in the Art, more
so than one can understand. The Elements are rectified without separation,
and you can make an Elixir from one metal only, because it has its own
proportion of weights. When the Elements are purified with solving and
coagulating, it is very good, but my method is much surer, because in working
with dissolving and coagulating, the element is separated together with
the faeces and the three other Elements. If is a good thing if its done
correctly and carefully, and if care is taken to preserve everything, to
lose nothing, and that the fire is well regulated during reverberation
in order to rectify the earth, so that fire, water, air can be extracted
therefrom. It requires careful attention to prevent anything from being
lost. When it does happen, however, you no longer have the right weight
of the Elements and you will never reach a happy end. Keep this well in
your hearts so that you may never forget it, for there must not be any
weakness, the Elements must have the oil their own weight and proportion.
It is therefore necessary to proceed very carefully in this Work where
the Elements have to be separated.
<p>It is indeed good if it is done in this way, and it makes an infinite
projection, much higher than when the elements are not separated. Therefore,
my Child, many of us have made mistakes and spent much time in vain before
they discovered the rectification of the Elements while they are together.
That is what I have revealed to you here. Therefore do not take any risks,
because I worry that you might go wrong and lose something of the Elements.
Then all cost and effort would be lost, as you would find in the end.
<p>Therefore, dear Sons, keep to my method and you cannot go wrong. You
may well lose dome of your powder in the washing, but what is left is perfect,
because Nature does not miss. The Elements remain united and are even ore
closely bound together by the Work than they were before. For when they
are pure and rid of their faeces and they are set to cement 3 times, they
will be so well congealed together than Luna will be fixed.
<p>Test it in AF --- it does not attack Luna --- It retains its colors
and also passes through copper. Calcination and cementation can also be
made with prepared common slat, without arsenic or tartar, but it takes
longer. And if you do it only with salt without arsenic and tartar, Luna
will not readily cement and calcine. It has to be repeated several times
--- about 3 times --- before Luna is calcined enough to be rubbed. That
is why arsenic and tartar are added, as they are sharp and work easily
through the laminae, so that the cementation must not be repeated often.
Thirdly, they result in a white tincture suitable for a White Work. But
if a Red Work is intended, I would be better to take Mercury to the Red
than arsenic, just as is done in the sublimation of Sol. This then is the
reason why arsenic is added to the salt; though, if ever you wished, you
could achieve it with salt alone. I myself have frequently tested and done
it. There is no difference in the cementation of Luna and Sol, except that
mercury to the Red is used instead of auripigment. Also, Sol must not be
pulverized and washed like Luna, and Sol does not contain any blackness
because tartar, mercury and the salt consumes all its faeces. Then you
Sol is rid of all its faeces, just like Luna. Thus you have all your cement
perfect and together and well purified. Although the separation of the
Elements causes a much higher and subtler projection, there is danger involved
in it. This purification, however, is sure and without worry.
<p>Now we will return to our Work, and I will first teach you how the Philosophical
Mercury is to be extracted. At the beginning I showed you many a Work which
other masters have performed, whom I saw working in the laboratory. Some
of them are perfect, others imperfect. Be that as it may, it is necessary
to have the Philosophical mercury if a good result is to be obtained. For
the Mercury which comes from the mines is a crude sperma, not yet sufficiently
cooked, and it would have to lie in the earth for another 300 years before
it would coagulate; then again, for many more years till it would turn
into a powder. Then, by long cooking in natural heat, it would become a
vapor. When it is finally a vapor, it passes into the opening of the minerals.
When it finds the Philosophical Sulfur with its spiritual nature, it turns
into a Corpus. After the Sulfur has been separated from its fattiness,
it results in a perfect metal, white or red. The Sulfur of the ignorant
is foam and faeces and the combustible fattiness of Vitriol. The latter
is separated well by the power of Nature which desire to rid herself of
her faeces, to rid the red Sulphur of the foam of the red vitriol, and
the white of the white vitriol, as is clearly indicted in the Vegetable
Work.
<p>When now the aforesaid mercurial vapor is conjoined with the Philosophical
Sulphur, it must still digest and cook for a long time in the bowels of
he earth before this Mercury and Sulfur congeal, and this may well take
over a thousand years. From this you can now understand that the mineral
sulfur is still but a crude thing, from which the seed of the metals is
cooked with the help of Nature, before it canes into a spirit. That is
why no metal is found in Mercury mines and no Mercury in metal mines. For
Mercury is a raw material, of no use in our Art. It is only an instrument
and a hammer to work with in our Art, and a means for extracting the colors
from metals and metallic things. But as far as its use in the Art is concerned
it is considered raw material and good for nothing for reasons indicated
above. I have told you all this so that you should know that all those
are wrong who work with such a Mercury.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Extraction of Mercury from Luna</font></b></center>

<p>If you wish to extract Mercury from a body, make first an AF with vitriol
and Sulfur. In it dissolve Luna, as is customary beat it down with common
water, and wash the saltiness off from the calx with clean water, dry it,
and put it in a wide-bottomed glass, set it in the Athanor or furnace wherein
the spirits are calcined, give it moderate heat such as is used to keep
lead melting, and let it stand in such heat for 6 weeks, The Luna will
open and mercury will be able to separate from the earth.
<p>You can likewise proceed with Sol, except that Sol must stand for 18
weeks or longer before its Mercury can be separated from its earth and
oil, which are always together. For Sol is a solid compact corpus. That
s why it must stand longer till it opens. It would therefore be better
to let it stand for 30 or 40 weeks. Then it will finally look like a sponge
and become as light that it is unbelievable. And if you put calx of Sol
in a glass bowl, the glass will be so full that it almost runs over. Then
it can be opened and the Mercury can easily be sublimated. In this manner
you can open all metals, so that you can extract their Mercury from them
by sublimation, as you have heard about the metallic salts.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Clarification of Luna</font></b></center>

<p>Sublimate it 3 or 4 times through vitriol or arsenic, and it will become
as clear as crystal, of which we will not say any more here. When now Sol
and Luna have thus been opened in the calcination furnace, or the athanor,
or the tripod, pound them small with *. To 1 lb of calx take 8 Lots of
*, which must be clear and transparent, without any moisture. Then put
it in a glass. Thereafter take distilled vinegar --- 5 times distilled
--- containing no faeces. Put it in another glass in which is the calx
of Luna, lute the tubes carefully, and let the lute dry. Hen light a fire
underneath and slowly distill the vinegar over the calx, always taking
1 ob of Luna to 4 lb of distilled vinegar. When the vinegar has all one
over, let it stand cold for 3 days; if you open it sooner, the distilled
vinegar and the * will fly away together with Luna, and you will not keep
anything. That is how strong the material is, because cold and hot come
together.
<p>When you wish to proceed further, put first some cut glass on its mouth
that closes tightly, lute it on immediately to prevent the powers from
escaping. Then set it in the Balneum and do not give it more fire than
will allow you to keep your hand in, and to drink the water without getting
burnt. Let it stand thus for 6 weeks, then let it cool, break it open,
lute it immediately with an alembic on top and well closed receptacles,
and distill it over in the Balneum in moderate heat as ong as something
goes over.
<p>Then take it out, set it in ashes, add the receptacle, give it first
a small fire, then a stronger one, till Mercury is ready to sublimate together
with the * as white as snow. Let it stand&nbsp; thus for 24 hours to allow
the Mercury to emerge from the earth. Then let it cool, remove the alembic,
and weigh the mass, Thus you will know how much Mercury you have sublimated
with the *. Put the sublimate back into a glass and sublimate it again.
If any faeces remin, you must sublimate it till nothing is left behind.
Preserve this mercury well till you need it.
<p>But in the vessel in which you hve sublimated the Mercury, the earth
and the oil of the Corpus are left. Take them out and weigh them, and you
will also know how much Mercury you have sublimated from them. Put this
earth in a glass and pour enough distilled vinegar over it to dissolve
it clearly. If there are any faeces, pour it off, and coagulate and dissolve
till there are no more faeces. Then you have a salt a clear as crystal.
<p>Now take the Mercury sublimated with *, and the salt. Rub them together
on the marble, thus dry. Then put the substance in a glass bowl and set
in the tripod or in the calcinations furnace. Let it stand there for 6
weeks and give it as much heat as if you were to keep lead in flux. At
the end of the sixth week, let it cool, put it in a humid cellar, cover
it with a linen cloth to prevent any dust from falling into it, and within
6 or 8 days everything will dissolve into clear water. It is the Philosophical
Vinegar. My Child must know that this is the right Philosophical Vinegar,
and when they write Our Acetum Distillatum, they mean this water, and it
is thus of which they write in such a strange way, about which we will
not speak here.
<p>Pour this water into a glass, and take 3 parts of Luna prepared in the
fire, and 1 part of Sol, prepared as taught. Dissolve each in AF and beat
it down, wash and dry it, and dissolve enough of each. For you must know
how much you will need. When you have prepared these two kinds of calx,
set the glass with the water, or the distilled Philosophical Vinegar in
ashes, and light a small fire underneath, such as is used to dissolve Luna
or Sol.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Mixing</font></b></center>

<p>Take 3 parts of calx of Luna and 1 part of calx of Sol, mix them together,
and put 1 3j or 2 of that in your water. Then if you have such water, and
if you wish to achieve a great Work, stopper the glass carefully and dissolve
it. When it is almost dissolved, add some more of it till it is no longer
dissolved and stays at the bottom. Then it is enough, and your water is
saturated with its own food and has drunk its own milk.
<p>You must know that this is the first solution in the world ever to have
been discovered, because here no mistake can be made in the proportion
of the weights, for as Mercury is dissolved, it at once dissolves all metals,
as has been taught in many other places. And it does not dissolve more
than it can handle. This is the best amalgamation one can find.
<p>When now the dissolution has been made, take another glass, such as
is here illustrated. Into that pour the dissolved material from the remaining
powder that is not dissolved and set it as deep in ashes as the matter
is in the glass --- not deeper. Give it heat like that of the sun at noon,
and not warmer. Cover the glass with a double linen cloth, and the material
will coagulate into a grey powder or mass. When it is coagulated, take
a round piece of glass, cut exactly to the mouth of the vessel, lute it
with a strong lute, and let it stand thus till you see that your material
is turning white. Then increase the fire like the sun in June, and keep
it thus in this heat till it as white as snow. Now increase the fire again
like the sun in Leo, and wit this heat crystalline longish stones will
grow out of your material, like glass or needles. Keep the glass in this
heat till you notice that no more crystals grow out of it. Now the material
is fixed. You must know that if the crystals do not appear, the material
has become fixed with the second heat. Be not concerned about it, for it
is better for everything to become fixed in low than in strong heat. For
when you first heat like the sun shining in the midst of summer, crystals
will shoot as long as a hand and as broad. But that is not good.
<p>It is better to cook the Stone in low heat, so that no crystal points
or stones grow out of it. If there grow too many and you give it a little
too much heat, the spirit rises in the form of a white vapor and attaches
itself above to the glass. When that happens, you must open the glass and
scrape the material down again. Take guard not to give it too much heat,
so that your material does not rise and turn yellow and red like a pebble.
Then it would be spoiled and you would have to start all over. Therefore,
see to it that you do not make your fire too strong, so as not to get the
yellowness or redness before the whiteness. It is better for the fire to
be too small than too big.
<p>When it is now perfectly white and no crystal points shoot out of it,
the material is fixed. Divide it into 2 parts, one half to the White, the
other to the red. Take the half which you wish to bring to the Red, set
it in ashes and bring it to the Red. Pour Paradise Water over the other
half to the white, and heat it till the White Stone is perfect --- before
you give the Red its fire. But this you must understand, this Paradise
Water must be extracted from Luna, and 9 parts of it must be drawn over
1 part of the White, and cooked therein till it is perfect.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Extraction of Live Mercury from Bodies</font></b></center>

<p>Now I will teach you how to make Paradise Water from Luna, and you must
know that t is extracted in two ways. The first form of the Work has already
been explained, but this one is made in a different way, because this Mercury
must go over alive. It is almost done in exactly the same manner, except
that instead of * you take clear transparent calcined *, the same weight
as *. When you have rubbed the calx Luna with *, you must not put the material
for a long time in the calcinations furnace to open it, but you must put
it in a glass, pour the vinegar over it, then distill it off, as has been
taught before. The mercury will go over in the alembic in drops, because
of the power of Nature contained in the *. Put this Mercury into a glass
retort and distill its phlegma off, as has been taught before.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Inceration</font></b></center>

<p>Thereafter, take it out and pour on 1 part of the white Stone 9 part
of Mercury, close it well, set it back in ashes to the other glass which
contains the Red Stone, and give it a somewhat stronger fire than the heat
of the sun in the summer --- as if you wished to make rosewater. Do this
till your Stone is well boiled and cooked in is own juice and sweat. Then
it will no more thirst in all eternity, that is, if the Stone has absorbed
the paradise Water and has turned into a powder. Now increase your fire
somewhat till the Stone begins to become white. For when the Stone has
drunk its milk, its color is between grey and black. Then the fire must
be increased by degrees, till the Stone is again perfectly white. This
whiteness surpasses the whiteness of snow and looks more like a heavenly
color than an artificially produced one. When you see this whiteness, rejoice
and thank od for his gifts which He has put in Nature.
<p>After this, remove one half from the glass. Piut the other in a crucible,
melt it. It flows as easily as wax. When it is melted, pour it into a wooden
mold, coated with sheep’s fat or oil, and you have a Stone as clear, hard,
and transparent as crystal.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Multiplication of the White</font></b></center>

<p>Regarding the half which you left in the glass, multiply it as follows:
Take it out and weigh it. To 1 part take 100 parts of Luna prepared in
the fire and dissolved in AF, well washed and dried, rubbed on a stone
with the medicine. When dry, put it back in a glass, and on 1 part of this
material pour 9 parts of Paradise Water extracted from Luna. Again seal
the glass, regulate the fire as before when you poured on the first Paradise
Water, and continue with the fire till the Paradise Water has been absorbed.
Now you can again take half of it out and use it to advantage, again multiplying
the other half, one to the Red, the second to the White. But both cannot
stand together on a furnace, as the Red requires a stronger heat than the
White. The multiplication, however, is the same, except that for the Red
the Paradise Water must be extracted from Sol, and for the White from Luna.
Thus you can at all times multiply the White and the Red, and tinge with
it --- but use it to the honor of God and the help of the poor.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Purification of the Stone</font></b></center>

<p>You know that I told you above to keep half of the Stone for the Red,
to pour Paradise Water over the other half, and to set it again in the
furnace to the White Stone till the White is accomplished. During this
time it turns yellow due to the small fire with which the White Stone is
prepared, it cannot become red. Therefore, continue with the fire by degrees
till the Stone takes on other colors and becomes somewhat darker due to
the yellowness. Keep on increasing the fire till the material is perfectly
red, like a ruby, and shines in the glass like fish eyes. And when the
signs appear, the Stone is made and fixed. I am telling you this so that
you should use the right measure of fire, for if you use too strong a fire,
causing the redness to appear before the yellowness, you must begin anew.
And if you get the whiteness before the blackness, it is the same.
<p>That is why a small fire is always better than too strong a fire. And
proceed only by degrees. As the colors change and heighten the fire is
to be increased, and this not only applies to our Work but to all others
as well. The right regulation of the fire is the second masterpiece of
our Art, and unless the proportion is carefully observed, everything is
lost.
<p>When the material is fixed and as red as a ruby, take it out and increate
it with fire paradise Water extracted from Sol, just as has been said about
Luna. Pour 9 parts of Paradise Water over 1 part of the Red Stone, seal
the glass above with strong lute, set it back in the furnace in the ashes,
and give fire as if you were to keep lead melting, till it has absorbed
all the Paradise water. Now it has turned into a grey powder --- rather
black than grey. Keep the fire at the same heat till the powder is quite
white. Now increase your fire considerably till you see the matter turn
yellow. Then increase the fire by degrees somewhat more, till the powder
is dark yellow. When al your powder is brown like saffron, so that it cannot
get any yellower, increase your fire considerably till you see the red
color appear. Continue with the fire till it is perfectly red like a ruby.
Now rejoice, because the Stone to the Red is made. Let it cool.
<p>Take one half out and leave the other half to multiply. Put what you
have taken out in a crucible, let it melt, and pour it into a small glass
coated with grease, pour the Stone into it, and it will be as hard as glass
and as red as a ruby. Take 1 part of it, throw it in 2000 parts of lead,
and it will turn into the best Sol, as highly colored as has ever been
seen, and it can stand all tests and examination. Thank God.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Multiplication to the Red</font></b></center>

<p>Thereafter, set the other half to multiply. To 1 part of the Stone take
200 parts of your calcined or cemented Sol, dissolve, wash, and dry it,
then melt it under the Stone, put it back into the glass, and pour on it
some of the solar Paradise Water --- 9 times as much as there is of the
mixed materia. Lute your glass carefully and give it fire just as if you
were to keep lead melting, as has been taught before. And don’t make a
mistake till the Stone is perfectly red --- otherwise all is lost. Now
praise God, and you can continue multiplying without end, always keeping
one half out.
