<blockquote><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Condensation Products
of Ethylene and Acetylene Formed through the Agency of the Silent Electric
Discharge"</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Berthelot has shown that a silent
electric discharge acting upon saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons will
split off hydrogen in varying quantities from the molecule and, instead
of polymerization products, condensation products will result. The author
reports the work upon ethylene and acetylene under these conditions. The
pure dry gases were introduced into a synthesizer, an ozonizer with manometer
attachment. In the case of ethylene the condensation product is soluble
in ethanol and diethyl ether and gives a molecular weight of 420. This
corresponds to a formula approaching C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>54</sub>. The
action of bromine and nitric acid upon this product led to its classification
with cyclic compounds. The acetylene product is extremely insoluble and
hence no molecular weight determination could be directly obtained. The
compound is similar in chemical properties to the preceding one, and is
undoubtedly of ring structure<b>. The deficiency in percentage of carbon
in these compounds is worthy of note</b>. An explanation for the same is
given by the author in the following abstract (<i>Monatsh.</i> 29: 1-4).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Mysterious Deficiency of Carbon
in the Condensation Products from Ethylene"</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pure dry ethylene and acetylene were
in turn brought under the influence of silent electric discharge, and the
condensation product in each case analyzed. The purest chemical reagents
were employed in these combustions.
<b>From several determinations the
percentage of carbon and hydrogen taken together fell below the theoretical
100%; in the case of the ethylene product a 7% and in that of the acetylene
product a 22% deficiency was noted.</b> This loss in the amount of hydrogen
and carbon required by the formulae of hydrocarbons has been accounted
for by Berthelot in the possibility of absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere.
The author has excluded this possibility by working with dry gases and
preserving the products in hermetically sealed tubes immediately upon their
formulation. It is also stated that condensed ethylene loses no carbon
on exposure to air and that condensed ethylene is hardly affected by many
weeks’ standing. The analysis of the products from sealed tubes and those
exposed for some time to the air were in agreement with each other. The
possible intake of oxygen during the removal from the tubes is practically
nil, owing to the rather insoluble nature of the compounds and the absence
of
any change in their appearance.
<b>These facts present us with a scientific
riddle, a chemical anomaly, which the author believes can be explained
only through experimental error or through the transmutation of elements.
As great care and precision were taken in all of the determinations, the
author is more convinced of the latter possibility, especially since these
condensation products, notably that of ethylene, possess strong radioactive
properties</b>. These products, therefore, may be considered, not as simple
hydrocarbons, but as compounds of these with known or unknown elements
here brought into existence through the action of the silent electric discharge
upon gaseous ethylene or acetylene.</font></blockquote>
