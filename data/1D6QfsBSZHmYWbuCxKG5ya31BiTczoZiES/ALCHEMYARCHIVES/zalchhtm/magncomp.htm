  <p>I will not hide a science which was revealed to me by the grace of
God;
I will not jealously guard it for myself alone, for fear of drawing His
curse. A science kept secret, a hidden treasure, what is its use? The
science
I have learned without invention, I transmit to you without regret.
Envy
disrupts everything, an envious man cannot be just before God. All
science,
all knowledge comes from God; it is a simple way of speaking to
indicate
that it comes from the Holy Spirit. No one can say: Our Lord Jesus
Christ
without also understanding: Son of God the Father, through the
operation
of the Holy Spirit. In the same way, this science of truth cannot be
separated
from Him who communicated it to me. </p>
  <p>I have not been sent to all, but only to those who admire the Lord
in
his works and whom God judges worthy. Only whosover has ears to hear
His
divine communication receives the secrets which have been transmitted
to
me by the grace of God, and these He never reveals to those who are
unworthy. </p>
  <p>Nature must serve as the foundation and the mode of science: the
Art
also works according to Nature as far as it can. It is necessary then,
that the Artist observe Nature and operate as she operates. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter I</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Formation of the Metals Generally from
the Sulphur
and the Mercury</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>It is observed that the essence of metals, insofar as we know, is
to
be produced in a general manner from Sulphur and Mercury. The
differences
alone of cooking and digestion results in a diversification of the
metallic
nature. I personally observed that in a single vessel, in the same
vein,
so to speak, nature had produced many metals, along with some silver
disseminated
here and there. We have clearly demonstrated in our treatise on
minerals
that the generation of metals is circular, that is, one passes easily
from
one to another following a circle, the cousin metals having similar
properties;
it is because of this that silver changes more readily into gold than
any
other metal. </p>
  <p>Indeed, there is not much in changing the color and weight of
silver,
this is easy, because a compact substance increases its weight quite
readily.
And since it contains a yellowish-white Sulphur, its color will also be
easy to transform. </p>
  <p>It is the same with other metals. The Sulphur is, so to speak,
their
father and the Mercury, their mother. </p>
  <p>Again, it is most true, if one says of it that in the union the
Sulphur
represents the sperm of the father and that the Mercury acts as a
coagulated
Menstruum in order to form the embryonic substance. The sulfur alone
cannot
produce, just as the father alone cannot produce. </p>
  <p>In the same way that the male begets his proper substance, in
mixture
with the menstrual blood, likewise, the Sulphur produces with the
mercury,
but alone it produces nothing. By this comparison we make note that the
Alchemist will have to raise at the outset, the specificity of the
metal
which has given him the Nature, then that he proceeds as nature
proceeded,
with the mercury and the Sulphur prepared and purified always following
the example of Nature. </p>
  <p><b>The Sulphur Contains Three Humid Principles ~</b> </p>
  <p>The first of these principles is especially elevated and volatile,
one
finds it in the exterior parts of the Sulphur, for the same reason,
that
of the great volatility of its elements, which ignite easily and
consume
the bodies with which they come into contact. </p>
  <p>The second principle is phlegmatic, otherwise called aqueous; it
is
found in close association with the former. The third is radical,
fixed,
adherent to the internal parts. That one alone is general, and one
cannot
separate it from the others without destroying the whole edifice. The
first
principle does not resist the fire; being combustible, it consumes
itself
in the fire and calcines the substance of the metal with which one
heats
it. Therefore, it is not only useless, but detrimental besides, to the
goal which we set ourselves. The second principle does not make the
bodies
moist, it does not produce, it cannot serve us at all. The third is
radical,
it penetrates all the particles of the matter which are necessary to
its
essential properties. </p>
  <p>It is necessary to rid the Sulphur of the first two principles in
order
that the subtility of the third force serve us in making a perfect
compound. </p>
  <p>The fire is nothing other than the vapor of the Sulphur; the vapor
of
the Sulphur, well purified and sublimed white and rendered very
compact.
Also the Alchemists are accustomed to skillfully raising the two
superfluous
principles in the Sulphur by way of acid baths, such as vinegar of
lemons,
sour milk, the milk of goats, the urine of infants, etc. They purify it
by lixiviation, digestion and sublimation. It is necessary, finally, to
rectify it by reduction in a manner so as not to have more than one
pure
substance containing the active, perfectible brother-force of the
metal.
Behold! We are oin possession of one part of our work. </p>
  <p><b>Of the Nature of the Mercury ~</b> </p>
  <p>The Mercury contains two superfluous substances, the earth and the
water.
The earthy substance has something of the Sulphur. The fire reddens it.
The aqueous substance has superfluous humidity. One easily rids the
mercury
of its watery and earthy impurities by sublimation and very acid baths.
Nature separates it into the dry state of the Sulphur and robs it of
its
earth by the heat of the Sun and the Stars. </p>
  <p>It obtains thus a pure Mercury, completely free of its earthy
substance,
containing no more foreign particles. It unites it then with a pure
Sulphur
and produces in the end the pure and perfect metals in the heart of the
earth. If the two principles are impure, the metals are imperfect. This
is why one finds different metals in the mines, which possess of the
purification
and of the digestion according to their rudiments. This is dependent on
the cooking. </p>
  <p><b>Of the Arsenick ~</b> </p>
  <p>The Arsenick is of the same nature as the Sulphur; both tint to
red
and to white. But there is more humidity in the Arsenick, and it
sublimes
less rapidly over the fire than the Sulphur. </p>
  <p>One knows how well Sulphur sublimes quickly and how it consumes
all
the bodies, except God. The Arsenick can unite its dry principle with
that
of the Sulphur, they temper each other, and once united, one separates
them only with difficulty, their tincture is toned down by this union. </p>
  <p>"The Arsenick", says Geber, "contains much of the Mercury; it can
also
be prepared like it". Know that the Spirit hidden in the Sulphur, the
Arsenick
and the animal oil, is named by the philosophers The White Elixir. It
is
unique, miscible with the volatile substance, from this one we extract
the red Elixir; it unites with the melted metals, thus as we have
experimented
with it, it purifies them. Not only because of the aforementioned
properties,
but also because there is one common proportion between its elements. </p>
  <p>The metals differ between themselves according to the purity or
impurity
of the first matter, so to speak, of the Sulphur and of the Mercury,
and
also according to the degree of the fire which produced them. </p>
  <p>According to philosophy, the Elixir also is called Medicine,
because
one assimilates the body of metals in the body of animals. Also we say
that there is a hidden Spirit in the Sulphur, the Arsenick and the oil
extract of the animal substances. It is that spirit for which we
search,
with whose aid we will tint all the imperfect bodies to perfection.
This
Spirit is called Water and mercury by the Philosophers. "The mercury",
says Geber, "is a medicine composed of the dry and the humid, the humid
and the dry". You understand the succession of operations: extract the
earth from the fire, the air from the earth, the water from the air,
since
the water can resist the fire. It is necessary to mark well these
teachings,
they are Universal Secrets. </p>
  <p>None of the principles which enter into the Work have strength by
themselves;
for they are linked in the metals, they cannot be perfected, they are
not
very fixed. Each lacks two substances, one miscible with the metals in
fusion, the other fixed which enables it to coagulate and fix. Also
Rhases
said: "There are four substances which change in season: each one of
these
is composed of the four elements and takes the name of the dominant
element.
Their marvelous essence was fixed in one body, and, with this last, one
can nourish the other bodies. This essence is composed of water and of
air, combined in such a way that the heat liquefies them. Here it is: a
marvelous secret. The minerals employed in Alchemy must, in order to
serve
us, have an action upon the melted bodies. The stones we use are four
in
number, two tint to white, the two others to red. Also: the white, the
red, the Sulphur, the Arsenick and Saturn have only that one same body!
But in this single body, what obscurities! And at first it is without
action
upon the perfect metals". </p>
  <p>"In the imperfect bodies, there is an acid water, bitter, harsh,
necessary
to our Art. As it dissolves and mortifies the bodies, it them revives
them
and recomposes them. Rhases says in his third letter: Those who search
our Enteleche, ask from whence the bitter aqueous fundamental comes. We
answer them: from the impurity of the metals. Because the water
contained
in Gold is sweet, it does not dissolve, on the contrary, it coagulates
and fortifies, because it contains neither acidity nor impurity like
the
imperfect bodies". This is why Geber said: "One calcines and dissolves
the gold and silver in vain, because our vinegar takes from the four
imperfect
bodies; this is the mortifying and dissolving spirit which mixes the
tinctures
of all the bodies that we employ in the Work. We need nothing but this
water, of little importance to us are the other Spirits". </p>
  <p>Geber is right; we have not to make a tincture for the fire to
adulterate.
Actually, on the contrary, it is necessary that the fire give it
excellence
and strength in order that it can ally itself with the melted metals.
It
is necessary that it strengthen, that it fix, that despite the fusion,
it rests intimately united with the metal. </p>
  <p>I will add that from the four imperfect bodies, one can extract
all.
As for the manner of preparing the Sulphur, the Arsenick, and the
Mercury
most highly acclaimed, one can bring it forth here. </p>
  <p>Indeed, when in this preparation we heat the spirit of the Sulphur
and
of the Arsenick, with the acid waters or the oil, for in extracting
this
volatile essence, the oil or unctuosity, we raise them above that which
is superfluous to them; it leaves the volatile force and the oil, these
things alone are those which are useful to us; but they are mixed in
the
acid water which served us in purifying, there is no means of
separating
these, but at least we are rid of the useless. It is necessary
therefore,
to find another means to extract from these bodies in order to obtain
the
water, the oil, and the very subtle spirit of the Sulphur which is the
true very active Tincture for which we search. We will work so with the
bodies in separating by decomposition or yet by distillation of their
natural
component parts, and we will arrive thus at the simple parts. Some,
ignoring
the composition of the Magistery want to work on the Mercury alone,
asserting
it has one body, one soul, one spirit, and that it is the first matter
of gold and silver. It is necessary to respond to them on the truth
which
several philosophers affirm, that the Work is made up of three things:
The Spirit, the Body, and the Soul, extracted from one only. But for
the
other part, one cannot find in something that which is not there. Now,
the Mercury does not have the red tincture, therefore, it alone cannot
suffice to form the body of the Sun; it will be impossible for us with
only the Mercury to direct the Work to a good end. The Moon alone
cannot
suffice, meanwhile this body is, so to speak, the foundation of the
Work. </p>
  <p>In whatever manner that one works and transforms the Mercury,
never
will it be able to establish a body. They say also: "One finds in the
Mercury
a red Sulphur, therefore it contains the red tincture". Error! The
Sulphur
is the father of the metals, one never finds it in the Mercury which is
female! </p>
  <p>A passive matter cannot fertilize itself. The Mercury contains
indeed
a Sulphur, but, as we have already said, it is an earthy Sulphur. We
remark
finally, that the Sulphur cannot support the fusion; therefore, the
Elixir
cannot be extracted from one thing only. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Putrefaction</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Fire produces death and life. A light fire dries the body. Here is
the
reason: Fire, coming into contact with a body, sets into motion the
element
similar to itself which exists in this body. </p>
  <p>This element is the Natural heat. The former one excites the fiery
part
of the body in the first place; there is a conjunction and the radical
humidity of the body rises to the surface while the fire works on the
exterior.
Those diverse portions of the body are gone which the radical humidity
united, the dead body is dissolved, is resolved, all its parts
separated
one from the other. The fire works here like a cutting instrument. That
which it dries and contracts of itself, it can do only so long as there
is a certain predisposition in the body, especially if the body is
compact
like one element. The last one needs a fixed agglutinate, which will
have
separated from the body before corruption. All this can be done by the
Sun, because it is in one nature hot and humid, through affinity with
the
other bodies. </p>

  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter III</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Regimen of the Stone</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>There are four stages of the Stone: (1) to decompose; (2) to wash;
(3)
to contract; (4) to fix. In the first stage, one separates the natures
because without division, without purification, there cannot be a
conjunction.
During the second stage, the separate elements are washed, purified,
and
restored to the simple state. In the third, one changes our Sulphur to
the mineral of the Sun, of the moon and of the other metals. In the
fourth,
all the bodies formerly extracted from our Stone are united, recomposed
and fixed so as to rest conjointly henceforth. </p>
  <p>There are some who count five stages in the Magistery: (1) to
resolve
the substance to the first matter; (2) to introduce our earth, the
black
magnesium, so to speak, as being related to the nature of the Sulphur
and
the mercury; (3) also to render the Sulphur as close as possible to the
mineral matter of the Sun and of the moon; (4) to compose of the
several
things a white Elixir; (5) to cook perfectly the white Elixir to give
it
the color of cinnabar, starting there in order to make the red Elixir. </p>
  <p>Finally, there are some who count four stages in the work, others
three,
others only two. These last count thus: (1) setting up the work and
purification
of the elements; and (2) conjunction. </p>
  <p>Mark well that which follows: The substance of the Stone of the
Philosophers
is common: one finds it everywhere, it is a viscous water like the
Mercury
that one extracts from the earth. Our viscous water is found
everywhere,
even in the Latrines, certain philosophers have said. And, several
imbeciles
take their words literally, searching for it in the excrements! </p>
  <p>Nature operates on this matter in raising something from it, its
earthy
principle, and in uniting something with it, the Sulphur of the
Philosophers,
which is not the vulgar sulphur, but a transparent Sulphur of red tint.
For to speak the truth, it is the Spirit of Roman Vitriol. Prepare it
thus:
take of Saltpeter and of Roman Vitriol, two pounds of each; pulverize
finely.
Hence, Aristotle is right when he says that one cannot in any way
change
the form of the metals, if one does not first reduce them to their
first
matter. This is easy as one will shortly see. Philosophy says that one
cannot go from one extreme to the other without an intermediary. At one
extremity of our Philosophical Stone, are two luminaries, gold and
silver;
at the other extremity, the perfect elixir or tincture, and in the
middle,
the Philosophical Water of Life, naturally purified, cooked and
digested. </p>
  <p>All these things are near to perfection and preferable to the more
primitive
bodies of nature. Likewise, by means of average heat, the ice dissolves
into water, for we have formerly had water. Thus, the metals are
resolved
to their first matter which is our Water of Life. The preparation is
indicated
in the chapters that follow. By itself alone, it can reduce all the
metallic
bodies to their first matter. </p>

  <center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter IV</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Sublimation of the Mercury</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>In the name of God, procure yourself a pound of pure mercury
issuing
from the mine. Of the other portion, take of Roman Vitriol and of
common
calcined salt, pulverize and mix well. Put these two latest matters
into
a large glazed earthenware flask and set over a mild fire until the
matter
begins to melt and flow. Then take your mineral mercury, put it in a
flask
with a long neck and drop-by-drop, pour it over the vitriol and salt in
fusion. Stir with a wooden spatula until the mercury is completely
consumed
and it leaves no trace. When it has completely disappeared, dry the
matter
over a gentle fire during the night. The next morning, you will take
the
well-dried matter and pulverize it finely on a stone. Place the
pulverized
matter in a sublimating flask called an Aludel, to sublime according to
the Art. Place on it the head of the vessel, and close the joints with
a philosophical luting, so that the mercury cannot escape. Place the
Aludel
in a furnace and seal it in so it cannot tilt over but stands straight.
Then make a little fire for about four hours to drive away the humidity
of the mercury and of the vitriol. After the evaporation of the
humidity,
increase the fire so that the pure white matter of the mercury
separates
itself from the impurities; do this fir four hours; you will see if it
suffices by introducing a wooden rod to the sublimating flask by way of
the principle opening, you will lower it just to the matter and
determine
whether or not the white matter of the mercury is uppermost in the
mixture.
If it is, raise the baton, close the aperture of the head with a luting
so that the mercury cannot escape, and increase the fire in such a way
that the white matter of the mercury rises above the faeces in the
Aludel.
Do this for four hours. Finally, heat with wood in a manner to obtain a
blaze: it is necessary that the bottom of the flask and the residue
becomes
red. Continue thusly until there remains a little of the white
substance
of the Mercury adherent to the faeces. The force and the violence of
the
fire will be spent during the separation. </p>
  <p>Stop the fire, allow the furnace and the matter to cool overnight.
The
next morning, return the flask to the furnace, lift the luting with
caution
in order not to sully the mercury, open the apparatus. If you find a
white
matter, sublimed, pure, compact, heavy, then you have succeeded. But if
the sublimate was spongy, light, porous, collect it and recommence the
sublimation on the residue adding now pulverized common salt. Operate
in
the same flask over the furnace, in the same manner, with the same very
high degree of fire. Then open the flask, see if the sublimate is
white,
compact, dense. Then collect it and put it carefully aside so that it
may
serve you when you have need to finish the Work. But if again it has
not
occurred as it should, you will have to sublime it a third time until
you
obtain it pure, compact, white and heavy. </p>
  <p>Notice that by this operation you have raised two impurities from
the
Mercury. At first you removed from it all its superfluous humidity; in
the second, you have rid it of its impure earthy parts which remained
in
the faeces. Thus, you have now sublimed it to a clear semi-fixed
substance. </p>
  <p>Put this aside as one has recommended to you. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter V</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Preparation of the Waters from Which You
Will
Derive the Water of Life</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Take two pounds of Roman Vitriol, two pounds of Saltpeter, one
pound
calcined Alum. Crush well, mix perfectly, put it in a glass Alembic.
Distill
the water according to ordinary procedures, closing the joints well,
lest
the spirits escape. Begin with a gentle fire, the heat more forcibly;
afterwards
heat with wood until the apparatus becomes white, so that all the
spirits
distill. Them, stop the fire. Let the furnace cool. Put this carefully
aside, for this is the Solvent of the Moon. Conserve it for the Work;
it
dissolves the silver and separates it from the gold. It calcines the
Mercury
and the crocus of Mars; it gives to the skin of a man, a brown
coloration
which is hard to get rid of. This is the prime water of the
philosophers,
it is perfecto the first degree. You will prepare three pounds of the
water. </p>
  <p><b>Second Water Prepared by Way of Sal Ammoniac ~</b> </p>
  <p>In the name of God, get one pound of the first water and therein
dissolve
four parts of pure and uncolored Sal Ammoniac. The dissolution done,
the
water will change color. It has acquired other properties. The prime
water
was greenish, it dissolved the Moon, it was without action on the Sun;
but as soon as one adds to it from the sal ammoniac, it takes on a
yellow
color. It dissolves gold, mercury and sulphur sublimate, and gives a
strong
yellow coloration to the skin of a man. Conserve this water preciously,
because it will serve us in the work. </p>
  <p><b>Third Water Prepared by Means of Mercury Sublimate ~</b> </p>
  <p>Take of the third mercuric water, perfected to the third degree,
pellucid;
put it to putrefy in the belly of a horse, in a flask with a long neck,
clean, well-sealed, for 14 days. Leave it to ferment, the impurities
drop
to the bottom and the water passes from yellow to red. At this time,
you
will retrieve the flask and you will put it over the cinders of a very
mild fire. Adapt to it the head of the alembic with a recipient. Begin
the distillation slowly. That which passes, bit by bit, is our Water of
Life. A very clear, pure, heavy, virginal milk, a very sour Vinegar.
Continue
the fire gently until all the water of life has distilled gradually
over.
Then, stop the fire, let the furnace cool and conserve with care your
distilled
water. This is it: Our Water of Life, Vinegar of the Philosophers,
Virgin&#8217;s
Milk which reduces the bodies to their first matter, It was given an
infinity
of names. </p>
  <p>Here are the properties of this water: a little bit deposited on a
thin
plate of hot copper, penetrates it immediately and leaves there a white
stain. Thrown over the coals, it emits a smoke. In air it congeals and
resembles ice. When one distills this water, all the drops don&#8217;t pass
following
the same path, rather, some pass here, others there. It does not work
on
the metals like strong corrosive water, which dissolves them, but it
reduces
to Mercury all the bodies that it bathes, just as you will see much
later. </p>
  <p>After the putrefaction, the distillation, the clarification, it is
pure
and very perfect. Free from every volatile, superfluous and corrosive
principle.
It is not a water which consumes, it does not dissolve the bodies but
reduces
them to Mercury. It owes this property to the original Mercury
dissolves
and putrefied to the third stage of perfection. It neither contains any
faeces nor earthy impurities. The last distillation separated them, the
black impurities are resting at the bottom of the alembic. The color of
this water is reddish-clue, clear; put it aside. This, it reduces all
the
calcined and putrefied bodies to their prime matter. </p>
  <p>When you want to reduce the calcined bodies with this water,
prepare
the bodies thusly: </p>
  <p>Take some of the body that you will want, Sun or Moon, and file it
very
fine. Pulverize this well using a stone prepared with common salt.
Separate
the salt by dissolving it in hot water. The pulverized lime will
resettle
at the bottom of the liquid. Decant. Dry the lime, soak it three times
in oil of Tartar, allowing the lime to absorb all the oil each time.
Finally,
put the lime in a little flask; pour it over the oil of Tartar, so that
the liquid has a depth of two fingers, then close the flask. Put it to
putrefy in the belly of a horse for 8 days. Then take the flask, decant
the oil and dry the lime. This done, put the lime into an equal amount
of our Water of Life. Close the flask and let it digest over a very
mild
fire until all the lime be converted into Mercury. Decant, then, the
water
with caution. Recover the corporeal Mercury; put it in a glass vessel,
putrefy it with water and common salt. Dry according to the laws, put
it
in a fine linen and squeeze out in drops. If it passes in its entirety,
it is good. If some portion of the amalgamate body remains, indicating
that the dissolution has not been complete, put the residue with a new
quantity of the consecrated water. Know that the distillation of the
water
must be done in a water-bath; for the air and the fire, one will
distill
over hot cinders. The water must be derived from the humid substance
and
not otherwise; the air and the fire must be an extract of the dry
substance
and none other. </p>

  </center>
  <p>It is less mobile, it flows less quickly than the other Mercury;
it
leaves traces of its fixed body in the fire: one drop placed on a thin
plate heated to red leaves a residue. </p>
  <p><b>Multiplication of the Philosophical Mercury ~</b> </p>
  <p>When you have your philosophical Mercury, take two portions of it
and
one portion of the filings mentioned much earlier. Make an amalgamate
of
these by cooking them together in a flask that has been well sealed and
placed over cinders of a temperate fire. The entire will resolve into
mercury.
You will therefore want to increase this to infinity, because the
amount
of the volatile always exceeds the amount of the fixed. It increases
indefinitely
giving to it its proper nature and there is always enough. </p>
  <p>Now you know how to prepare the Water of Life, you understand some
of
the stages and the properties, you understand the putrefaction of the
metallic
bodies, their reduction to the prime matter, the multiplication of the
matter to infinity. I clearly explained to you all that which the
Philosophers
hid with care. </p>
  <p>It is not the vulgar Mercury, it is the first matter of the
Philosophers.
It is aqueous cold, a humid element; it is a permanent water, it is the
spirit of the body, an oily vapor, consecrated Water, strong water,
Water
of the Sages, Vinegar of the Philosophers, mineral water, Rose of the
Celestial
Grace; it has many other names besides these and indeed, many they be
that
are different! However, they all designate one and the same thing which
is the Mercury of the Philosophers. It is the focus of Alchemy; alone
it
can serve to make the tincture, the white and the red, etc. </p>
  <p>Take then, in the name of Jesus Christ, our venerable Water of the
Philosophers,
original Hyle of the Sages; it is the stone that one revealed for you
in
this treatise. It is the first matter of the perfect body, as you have
determined. Put your matter in a furnace, into a clean vessel, clear
transparent
and round, whose opening you will hermetically seal, so that nothing
can
escape. Your matter is to be placed on a level bed or surface, slightly
hot. You will leave it there for one Philosophical month. Maintain the
heat evenly, so that the perspiration of the matter will sublime, until
it sweats no longer, that nothing rises or descends, That it begins to
putrefy, to suffocate, to coagulate and to fix by maintaining the
constancy
of the fire. It will not raise more of the exalted, smoky substance,
and
our Mercury will remain on the bottom, dry, robbed of its humidity,
putrefied,
coagulated, changed to a black earth, that one calls Head of the Raven,
a dry and earthy element. </p>
  <p>When you have done this, you will have accomplished the genuine
sublimation
of the Philosophers, during this you will have examined all the
aforementioned
stages, to wit: sublimation of the Mercury, distillation, coagulation,
fixation, in one only vessel and with one only furnace as was stated. </p>
  <p>Indeed when our stone is in its vessel, and it is increase, one
says
that there is sublimation or ascension. When afterwards it again
settles
to the bottom, one says that there is distillation or precipitation.
Next,
when after the distillation and sublimation, our stone begins to
putrefy
and to coagulate, it is the putrefaction and the coagulation; finally
when
it calcines and fixes through the loss of its radical, aqueous
humidity.
It is the calcinations and fixation; all this is done through the
single
act of heating, in a single furnace, in a single vessel, as was said. </p>
  <p>This sublimation constitutes a genuine separation of the elements,
according
to the Philosophers: "The Work of Our Stone consists only of the
Separation
and Conjunction of the elements; because in our sublimation, the
aqueous,
cold and humid element changes to a dry, earthy and hot element". It
follows
that the separation of the elements of our stone is not vulgar, but
philosophical:
our single, very perfect sublimation indeed suffices to separate the
elements.
In our stone there is the form of only two elements, the water and the
earth, which potentially contain the other two. The Earth potentially
(or
virtually) contains the Fire, because of its dryness; the Water
potentially
contains the Air because of its humidity. It is thus quite evident that
although our stone has only the form of two elements, it potentially
contains
all four. </p>
  <p>Also a Philosopher said of it: "There is not a separation of the
four
elements in our stone like the imbeciles think. Our nature contains a
very
hidden secret; thus one sees the power and the strength, the earth and
the water. It contains two other elements, the air and the fire.
However,
these are neither visible nor tangible, one cannot represent them, one
ignores their influence, they disclose nothing which does not manifest
in the two other elements, earth and water, when the fire changes the
colors
during the digestion". </p>
  <p>Behold that by the grace of God, you have the second component of
the
Philosophical stone; which is the Black Earth, the Head of a Crow,
mother,
heart, origin of the other colors. From this earth, as the one body,
all
the rest take their birth. This dry earthy element received in the
books
of the Philosophers, Nummus, black sulfur, male, husband, etc. Despite
this endless variety of names, it is the single and the same thing
always,
derived from a single matter. Because the Philosophical sublimation
resulted
in a deprivation of humidity, the volatile became fixed, the soft
became
hard and the aqueous became earthy, according to Geber. </p>
  <p>This is the metamorphosis of the nature, the changing of the water
to
fire, according to The Turba. It is also the changing of the cold and
humid
constitutions to bilious, dry constitutions, according to the doctors.
Aristotle says that the spirit took a body, and Alphidius says that the
liquid became viscous. The hidden became manifest, says Rudianus in the
Book of the Three Words. One now understands the Philosophers when they
say: "Our great Work is not other than a permutation of nature, an
evolution
of the elements". It is quite evident that by this deprivation of
humidity,
we render the stone dry, the volatile becomes fixed, the spirit becomes
corporeal, the liquid becomes solid, the fire changes to water, the air
to earth. We have thus changed the true natures following a certain
order;
we have permuted their natures. That God be eternally blessed! Amen. </p>
  <p>Let us now pass, with the permission of God, to the second
operation
which is the whitening of our pure earth. Take then, two parts of the
fixed
earth or Head of a Raven: digest it subtly with precaution in an
excessively
clean mortar. Add to it one part of the Philosophical water that you
know
of (That which you have put aside). Unite these by imbibing the dry
earth
little by little into the water until its thirst is quenched. Digest
and
mid well enough that the union of the body, of the soul and of the
water
be perfect and intimate. This done, you will put all of it in a
hermetically
sealed flask so that nothing will escape. Place the flask over a little
warm bed, always hot and kept level, so that in sweating, its entrails
are rid of the liquid which it drank. You will leave it there eight
days
until the earth whitens somewhat. </p>
  <p>You will then take the Stone, you will pulverize it, soak it again
in
the virginal milk, stirring, until its thirst is quenched. Put it again
in the flask over its warm little bed so that it dries like that above.
You will repeat this operation four times following the same order: The
soaking of the earth by water until perfect union: The soaking of the
earth
by water until perfect union, dessication and calcinations. You will
then
have sufficiently purified the Head of the Raven, the black and foetid
earth, you have brought it to whiteness by the strength of the fire, of
the heat, and the whitened water. Gather your white earth and put it
carefully
aside. This is very precious because it is the foliated white earth,
white
Sulphur, white Magnesia, etc. Morien speaks of it when he says: "Put
this
earth with its water to putrefy so that it purifies, and with the aid
of
God you will finish the Magistery". Hermes says the same as Azoth, wash
the Laton and raise it from all its impurities. </p>
  <p>In this latest operation, we produced a genuine conjunction of the
elements,
because the water united with the earth, the air with the fire. It is
this
union of the man with the woman, of the male with the female, of the
gold
with the silver, of the dry and the impure celestial water. </p>
  <p>There was also a resurrection of dead bodies. This is why the
Philosophers
said: "Those who do not know how to kill and how to revive, abandon the
Art".
And elsewhere: "Those who know how to kill and how to revive, will
profit
from our science. This one will be the Prince of the Art who will do
these
two things". Another Philosopher said: "Our dry Earth does not bear any
fruit if it is not profoundly soaked in its Rain Water. Our dry Earth
has
a great thirst, when it begins to drink, it drinks down to the dregs".
Another said: "Our Earth drinks the fertile water that it awaited, it
quenches
its thirst, then it produces hundreds of fruits". One finds many
similar
passages in the books of the Philosophers, but they are in the form of
parables, so that the evil cannot understand them. By the Grace of God,
you now possess our white foliated Earth, all ready to undergo the
fermentation,
which will give it breath. Also the Philosophers said: "Whiten the
black
Earth before uniting it with the ferment". Another said: "Sow your gold
in the white foliated Earth, and it will give you fruit an
hundredfold".
Glory to God. Amen. </p>
  <p>We pass to the third operation which is the fermentation of the
white
Earth. It is necessary to animate and revive the dead body, in order to
multiply its strength to infinity, and to cause it to pass to the state
of the perfect white elixir which changes the Mercury to the genuine
and
perfect Moon. Note that the ferment cannot penetrate the dead body,
that
by the intermediary of the water the marriage is made and the bond set
between the white earth and the ferment. This is why in all
fermentation,
it is necessary to note the weight of each thing. If then you want to
set
the white Earth aside to ferment in order to change it to the white
Elixir
containing an excess of the tincture, it is necessary to take three
parts
of the white Earth or dead foliated Body, two parts of the Water of
Life,
that you put in reserve and one-half of the ferment. </p>
  <p>Prepare the ferment in such a way that it is reduced to a white
lime,
bound and fixed, if you want to make the white elixir. If you want to
make
the red Elixir, condense the lime of the very yellow gold, prepared
according
to the art. There are no other ferments like these here. The ferment of
silver is silver, the ferment of gold is gold, therefore don&#8217;t look
elsewhere!
The reason for this is that the two bodies are luminous, they contain
the
brilliant lights which communicate to the other bodies true redness and
whiteness. They are of one nature, similar to that of sulphur, the
purest
of the matter of this type of stone. Extract then, each kind from its
own
kind, each family from its own family. The work of the white has as a
goal,
to whiten; the work of the red, to redden. Above all, do not mix the
two
Works, otherwise nothing will work well. </p>
  <p>All the Philosophers say that our stone is composed of three
things:
The Body, the Spirit and the Soul. Now the white Earth is the Body, the
ferment is the Soul, which gives it its life, the intermediary water is
the Spirit. Reunite these three things in one by marriage, digesting
them
well over an appropriate stone, so as to unite them in their smallest
particles,
to form from it a confused chaos. When you have made a single body of
all,
put it carefully in a special flask which you will place over its hot
bed,
so that the mixture coagulates, fixes and becomes white. You will take
the blessed white stone, you will pulverize it finely over a very clean
stone, soak it with a third of its weight of water to slake its thirst.
Then return it to the clear and clean flask placed over its soft and
hot
bed so that it commences to sweat and to yield its water, and finally
you
will leave its entrails to dry. Repeat often until you have prepared by
this procedure our very excellent fixed white Stone, which penetrates
the
tiniest part of the bodies very rapidly, flowing like the fixed water
when
one puts it over the fire, changing the imperfect bodies to genuine
silver,
quite comparable to natural silver. Note that if you often repeat all
the
operations in the same order: to dissolve, to coagulate, to pulverize,
to digest, your medicine will be so much the better, its excellence
increasing
more and more. Furthermore, you will work your Stone in order to
increase
the virtue, and more, you will have the yield when you make the
projection
upon imperfect bodies in a way so that after one operation, one part of
the Elixir transmutes one hundred parts of whatever body to the Moon,
after
two operations one thousand, after three, ten thousand, after four, one
hundred thousand, and so on, ad infinitum. Also the adepts praise all
the
great maxims of the Philosophers about the perseverance to repeat this
operation. If one imbibition was sufficient, they would not have had so
much to say upon the subject. Grace be given unto God. Amen. </p>
  <p>If you desire to change the glorious stone, this white King which
transmutes
and tints the Mercury and all the imperfect bodies into the true Moon,
if you desire, I say, to change it to the red stone which tints and
transmutes
the Mercury, the Moon and the other metals to the true Sun, operate
thusly:
Take the White Stone and divide it into two parts; you will raise one
part
to the state of the white Elixir, as has been said much earlier (of the
kind of which you will have an indefinite amount). Put the other part
in
a new bed of the Philosophers, clean, tidy, transparent, spherical and
place it in the furnace for digestion. Increase the fire until by its
force
and strength the matter is changed to a very red stone, that the
Philosophers
call Blood, purple, red coral or red sulphur. When you see this color
so
that there is as bright as that of the dry calcined crocus, then take
the
King joyously, put it aside very carefully. If you want to change it to
the red Elixir, a tincture of great strength, transmuting and tingeing
the Mercury, the Moon and all other imperfect metal bodies, to the very
genuine Sun, bring the ferment three parts with one and a half parts of
very pure gold, to the state of perfection and very yellow, and two
parts
of solidified water. Make of it a perfect mixture according to the
rules
of Art, until into longer is possible to distinguish the components.
Put
it again in a flask over a matured fire in order to perfect it. As soon
as the true Stone appears blood red, you will gradually add the sold
Water. </p>
  <p>Slowly increase the fire of digestion. By repeating this
operation,
you will increase its perfection. It is necessary to add, each time,
the
solid Water (that you preserved), which draws to its nature; it
multiplies
its strength to infinity, without changing anything of its essence. One
part of the perfect Elixir of the first degree, projected over one
hundred
parts of the Mercury (washed with some vinegar and some salt as you
should
know), placed in a crucible over a small fire, until smoke appears,
immediately
transmutes them to the genuine Sun, better than the natural. The same
in
replacing Mercury by the Moon. </p>
  <p>For each degree of perfection, from most of the Elixir, it is the
same
thing as that for the white Elixir, until it tints it finally to the
Sun
of the infinite quantities of the Mercury and the Moon. You now possess
a precious secret, an infinite treasure. This is why the Philosophers
say:
"Our stone has three colors; it is black at the outset, white in the
middle,
the end". A Philosopher said: "The heat works first on the humidity to
produce the blackness, its action on the dry produces the white and on
the white produces the red. Thus the whiteness is nothing other than
the
complete absence of blackness. The white skillfully condensed by the
force
of the fire produces the red". --- "All you seekers who work the Art",
said another sage, "When you see the white appear in the vessel, know
that
the red is hidden in the white. It is necessary that you extract it
from
it and for this to heat forcefully until the appearance of the red". </p>
