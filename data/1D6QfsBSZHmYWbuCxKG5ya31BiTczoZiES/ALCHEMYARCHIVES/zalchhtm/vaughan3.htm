<p>Every man naturally desires a superiority, to have treasures of gold
and silver, and to seem great in the eyes of the world. God indeed created
all things for the use of man, that he might rule over them and acknowledge
therein the singular goodness and omnipotence of God, give Him thanks for
His benefits, honor Him and praise Him. But there is no man looks after
these things otherwise than by spending his days idly. They would enjoy
them without any previous labor and danger; neither do they look for them
in that place where God has treasured them up, Who expects also that man
should seek for them there, and to those that seek will He give them. But
there is not any that labors for a possession in that place, and therefore
these riches are not found. For the way to this place --- and the place
itself --- have been unknown for a long time, and it is hidden from the
greatest part of the world. But notwithstanding that it be difficult and
laborious to discover this way and place, yet the place should be sought
after. But it is not the will of God to conceal anything from those that
are His; and therefore in this last age --- before the final judgement
comes --- all these things shall be manifested to those that are worthy.
As He Himself --- though obscurely, lest it should be manifested to the
unworthy --- has spoken in a certain place, "There is nothing covered that
shall not be revealed and hidden that shall not be known." We therefore,
being moved by the Spirit of God, do declare the will of God to the world,
which we have also already performed and published in several languages.
But most men either revile or condemn our Manifesto, or else --- waiving
the Spirit of God --- they expect the proposals thereof from us, supposing
that we will straightway teach them how to make gold by art, or furnish
them with ample treasures, whereby they may live pompously in the face
of the world, swagger and make wars, turn usurers, gluttons and drunkards,
live unchastely and defile their whole life with several other sins ---
all of which are contrary to the blessed will of God. These men should
have learned from those ten Virgins --- whereof five that were foolish
demanded oil for their lamps from those five that were wise --- how that
the case is much otherwise. It is expedient that every man should labor
for this treasure by the assistance of God and his own particular search
and industry. But the perverse intentions of these fellows we understand
out of their own writings, by the singular grace and revelation of God.
We do stop our ears and wrap ourselves, as it were, in clouds to avoid
the bellowings and howlings of those men who cry out in vain for gold.
<p>And thus indeed it comes about that they brand us with infinite calumnies
and slanders, which nevertheless we do not resent; but God in His good
time will judge them for it. But after we had known well --- though unknown
to you --- and perceived by your writing how diligent you are to pursue
the Holy Scripture and seek the true knowledge of God, we have out of many
thousands thought you worthy of some answer; and we signify this much to
you by the will of God and the admonition of the Holy Spirit.
<p>There is a Mountain situated in the midst of the earth or center of
the world, which is both small and great. It is soft, also above measure
hard and stony. It is far off and near at hand, but by the providence of
God invisible. In it are hidden the most ample treasures, which the world
is not able to value. This mountain --- by envy of the devil, who always
opposes the glory of God and the happiness of man - is compassed about
with very cruel beasts and ravening birds --- which make the way thither
both difficult and dangerous. And therefore until now - because the time
is not yet come - the way thither could not be sought after nor found out.
But now at last the way is to be found by those that are worthy - but nonetheless
by every man's self-labor and endeavors.
<p>To this Mountain you shall go in a certain night --- when it comes ---
most long and most dark, and see that you prepare yourselves by prayer.
Insist upon the way that leads to the Mountain, but ask not of any man
where the way lies. Only follow your Guide, who will offer himself to you
and will meet you in the way. But you are not to know him. This Guide will
bring you to the Mountain at midnight, when all things are silent and dark.
It is necessary that you arm yourselves with a resolute, heroic courage,
lest you fear those things that will happen, and so fall back. You need
no sword nor any other bodily weapons; only call upon God sincerely and
heartily.
<p>When you have discovered the Mountain the first miracle that will appear
is this: A most vehement and very great wind that will shake the Mountain
and shatter the rocks to pieces. You will be encountered also by lions
and dragons and other terrible beasts; but fear not any of these things.
Be resolute and take heed that you turn not back, for your Guide --- who
brought you thither --- will not suffer any evil to befall you. As for
the treasure, it is not yet found, but it is very near.
<p>After this wind will come an earthquake that will overthrow those things
which the wind has left, and will make all flat. But be sure that you do
not fall off. The earthquake being past, there will follow a fire that
will consume the earthly rubbish and disclose the treasure. But as yet
you cannot see it.
<p>After these things and near the daybreak there will be a great calm,
and you will see the Day-star arise, the dawn will appear, and you will
perceive a great treasure. The most important thing in it and the most
perfect is a certain exalted Tincture, with which the world - if it served
God and were worthy of such gifts --- might be touched and turned into
most pure gold.
<p>This Tincture being used as your Guide shall teach you will make you
young when you are old, and you will perceive no disease in any part of
your bodies. By means of this Tincture also you will find pearls of an
excellence which cannot be imagined. But do not you arrogate anything to
yourselves because of your present power, but be contented with what your
Guide shall communicate to you. Praise God perpetually for this His gift,
and have a special care that you do not use it for worldly pride, but employ
it in such works as are contrary to the world. Use it rightly and enjoy
it as if you had it not. Live a temperate life and beware of all sin. Otherwise
your Guide will forsake you and you will be deprived of this happiness.
For know of a truth: whosoever abuses this Tincture and does not live exemplarly,
purely and devoutly before men, will lose this benefit and scarcely any
hope will be left of recovering it afterward.
