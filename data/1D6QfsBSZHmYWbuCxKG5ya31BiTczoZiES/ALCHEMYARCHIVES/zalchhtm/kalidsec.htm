Chapter XXII</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Difficulties of this Art</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><b>I.&nbsp;</b> Thanks be given to God, the Creator of all things,
who
hath made us, renewed us, taught us, and given us knowledge and
understanding;
for except he should keep us, preserve us, and direct us, we should
wander
out of the right way, as having no Guide or Teacher: Nor can we know
any
thing in this World, unless he teach us, who is the beginning of all
things,
and the Wisdom it self, his power and goodness, it is with which he
overshadows
his People. </p>
  <p><b>II.&nbsp;</b> He directs and instructs whom he pleases, and by
His
long-suffering, and tender Mercies, brings them back into the way of
Righteousness.
For he has sent this Angels (or Spirit) into the dark places, and made
plain the Ways, and with his loving kindness replenishes such as love
Him. </p>
  <p><b>III.&nbsp;</b> Know then my Brother, that this magistery of our
Secret
Stone and this Valuable Art, is a secret of the Secrets of God, which
he
has hidden with his own People; not revealing it to any, but to such
who
as Sons faithfully have deserved it, who have known his Goodness and
Almightyness. </p>
  <p><b>IV.&nbsp;</b> If you would request any Earthy thing at the Hand
of
God, the Secret of this Magistery is more to be desired than anything
else.
For the Wise Men who have perfected the knowledge thereof, have not
been
wholly plain but speaking of it, have partly concealed it, and partly
revealed
it; And in this very thing, I have found the preceding Philosophers to
agree, in all their so much valued Books. </p>
  <p><b>V.&nbsp;</b> Know therefore, that Musa, my own disciple (more
valuable
to me than any other) having diligently studied their Books, and
laboured
much in the Work of this Magistery, was much perplexed, not knowing the
Natures of things belonging thereto: Whereupon he humbly begged at my
Hands,
my Explanation thereof, and my Directions therein. </p>
  <p><b>VI.&nbsp;</b> But I gave him no other Answer, Than that he
should
read over the Philosophers&#8217; Books, and therein to seek that which he
desired
of me: Going his way, he read above an hundred Books of the Secret of
the
Great Philosophers: but by them he could not attain the knowledge of
that
Mystery which he desired, though continually studying it for the space
of a Year, for which reason he was as one astonished and much troubled
in mind. </p>
  <p><b>VII.&nbsp;</b> If then Musa my Scholar (who has deserved to be
accounted
among the Philosophers) has thus failed in the knowledge of this
Mystery;
what may be supposed from the Ignorant and Unlearned, who understand
not
the Natures of things, nor apprehend whereof they consist? </p>
  <p><b>VIII.&nbsp;</b> Now when I saw this in my most dear and chosen
Disciple,
moved with Piety and Love to him, by the Will also and Appointment of
God,
I wrote this my book near the time of my Death, in which though I have
pretermitted many things which the Philosophers before me have
mentioned
in their Books; yet have I handled some things which they have
concealed,
and could not be prevailed withal to reveal or to discover. </p>
  <p><b>IX.&nbsp;</b> Yea, I have explicated, and laid open certain
things
which they hid under enigmatical and dark Expressions; and this my Book
I have named, The Secrets of Alchymie, for that I have revealed in it,
whatsoever is necessary to the knowledge of this Learning in a Language
befitting the matter, and to your sense and understanding. </p>
  <p><b>X.&nbsp;</b> I have taught four Magisteries far greater and
better
than the other Philosophers have done, of which number the One is a
Mineral
Elixir, another Animal; the other two are Mineral Elixirs; but not the
one Mineral whose virtue is to wash, cleanse, or purifie those things
which
they call the Bodies. And another is to make Gold of Azot Vive; whose
Composition
or Generation is according to the Natural Generation in the Mines, or
in
the Heart and Bowels of the Earth. </p>
  <p><b>XI.&nbsp;</b> And these four Magisteries or Works, the
Philosophers
have discoursed of, in their Books of the Composition thereof, but they
are wanting in many things, nor would they clearly show the Operation
of
it in their Books: and when by chance any one found it out, yet could
he
not thoroughly understand it; than which nothing was more grievous to
him. </p>
  <p><b>XII.&nbsp;</b> I will therefore in the work declare it,
together
with the way and the manner how to make it, but if you read me, learn
to
understand Geometrical proportion, that so you may rightly frame your
Furnaces,
not exceeding the mean, either in greatness or finalness; with all you
must understand the proportion of your Fire, and the form of the Vessel
fit for your work. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.&nbsp;</b> Also you must consider, what is the ground work
and
beginning of the magistery: which is as the Seed and Womb to the
Generation
of Living Creatures, which are shaped in the Womb, and therein receive
their Fabrick, Increase and Nourishment. For if the Prima Materia of
our
Magistery is not conveniently managed, the Work will be spoiled and you
will not find that which you seek after, nor shall you bring your Work
to perfection. </p>
  <p><b>XIV.&nbsp;</b> For where the cause of Generation is wanting, or
the
root of the matter, and heat itself, your labor will be lost and the
Work
come to nothing. The same also will happen, if you mistake in the
proportion
or weight; for if that not be right, to wit, the proportion of the
parts
compounding, the matter compounded missing of its just temperature will
be destroyed, and so you shall reap no fruit, the which I will show by
an Example. </p>
  <p><b>XV.&nbsp;</b> See you not that in Soap (with which Clothes are
washed
clean and white) that it has its virtue and property by reason of the
just
proportion of its Ingredients, which spread themselves in length and
breadth,
and because of which they agree in length and breadth, and because of
which
they agree to the same end; by which it appears, that the Composition
was
truly made, and the power and efficacy which before lay hid (which is
called
Property) is now brought to light, which is the quality of washing and
cleaning in a proper Laver? </p>
  <p><b>XVI.&nbsp;</b> But should the ingredients have been put
together
without proportion, being either too little or too much, the virtue and
efficacy of the Soap would be destroyed, not would it any ways answer
the
end desired; for that end of effect ariseth from the just proportion
and
mixion of each Ingredient: The same you must understand, to happen in
the
Composition of our Magistery. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter XXIII</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Four Principal Operations, Solution,
Congelations,
Albification and Rubifaction</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Beginning now to speak of the Great Work, which
they
call Alchymie I will open the mater without concealing ought, or
keeping
back anything, save that which is not fit toe declared: We say them
that
the great work contains four Operation, viz., to Dissolve, to Congeal,
to make White and to make Red </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; There are four quantities partakers together; of
which
two are partakers between themselves; so also have the other two a
coherence
between themselves. And either of these double quantities, has another
quantity partaker of them, which is greater than these two. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; I understand by these quantities, the quantities
of
the Natures, and weight of the Medicines, which are in order dissolved
and congealed, wherein neither addition nor diminution have any place.
But these two, viz., Solution and Congelation are one Operation, and
make
but one Work, and that before Composition, but after; but after
Composition
those Operations be divers. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; And this Solution and Congelation which we have
spoken
of, are the solution of the Body, and the congelation of the Spirit,
which
two, have indeed but one Operation; for the Spirits are not congealed,
except the Bodies be dissolved; as also the bodies are not dissolved
unless
the Spirit be congealed. And when the Soul and the Body are joined
together,
each of them works its Companion into its own likeness and property. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; As for example, When Water is put to Earth, it
strives
to dissolved the Earth, by its virtue, property, and moisture, making
it
softer than it was before, bringing it to be like itself, for the Water
was more thin than the Earth. And thus does the Soul work in the Body,
and after the same manner is the Water thickened with the Earth and
becomes
like the Earth in thickness, for the Earth was more thick the Water. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Know also, that between the solution of the Body
and
the congelation of the Spirit, there is no distance of time, not
diversity
of work, as thought the one should be without the other; as there is no
difference of time in the conjunction of the Earth and Water, that the
one might be distinguished from the other by its operation. But they
have
both one instant, and one fact, and one and the same work performs both
at once, before Composition. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; I say, before Composition, lest he that should
read
my Book, and hear the terms of Solution and a Congelation, should
suppose
it to be the Composition which the Philosophers treat of, which would
be
a grand Error both in Work and Judgment: Because Composition in this
Work
is a Conjunction or Marriage of the congealed Spirit with the dissolved
Body, which Conjunction is made upon the fire. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; For heat is its nourishment, and the Soul
forsakes
not the Body, neither is it otherwise knit into it, than by the
alteration
of both from their own virtue and properties, after the Conversion of
their
Natures: and this is the solution and congelation which the
Philosophers
first speak of. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Which nevertheless they have absconded by their
Enigmatic
Discourse, with dark and obscure Words, whereby they alienate and
estrange
the minds of their Followers, from understanding the Truth: whereof I
will
now give you the following Examples. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; Besmear the Leaf with Poyson, so shall you obtain
the
beginning of the Stone, and the Operation thereof. Again, Work upon the
strong Bodies with one solution, till either of them are reduced to
subtility.
Also, except you bring the Bodies to such a subtility that they may be
impalpable, you shall not obtain that you seek after. And, If you have
not ground them, repeat the Work till they be sufficiently ground and
made
subtil, so shall you have your desire. With a thousand such other like
unintelligible, without a particular demonstration thereof. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; And in like manner have they spoken of that
Composition
which is after solution and congelation, Thus: Our Composition is not
perfect
without Conjunction and Putrefaction, Again, You must dissolve,
congeal,
separate, conjoin, putrefy and compound, because Composition is the
beginning
and very life of the thing. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b> But &#8216;tis true that unless there be a compounding, the
Stone
can never be brought to light: There must be a separation of the parts
of the Compound, which separation is in order also to a Conjunction. I
tell you again, that the Spirit will not dwell with the Body, nor enter
into it, nor abide in it, until the body be made subtil and thin as the
Spirit is. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.</b>&nbsp; But when it is attenuated and made subtil, and
has
caste off its thickness and grossness, has forsaken its Corporeity, and
become Spiritual; then shall it be conjoined with the subtil Spirits,
and
imbibe them, so that both shall become one and the same thing, nor
shall
they forever be severed, but become like water mixt with water, which
no
man can separate. </p>

and Rubification</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Suppose that of two like quantities which are in
solution
and congelation, the larger is the Soul and the Lesser is the Body: Add
afterwards to the quantity which is the Soul, that quantity which is in
the Body, and it shall participate with the first quantity in virtue
only.
Then working them as we have wrought them, you will have your desire,
and
understand Euclid his Line or Proposition </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; Then take this quantity, weigh it exactly, and
add
to it as much moisture as it will drink up, the weight of which we have
not determined; Then Work them as before, with the same Operations of a
first imbibing and subliming it: This Operation is called Albification,
and they name it Yarit, that is Silver or White Lead. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; When you have made this Compound white, add to
it
so much of the Spirit, as will make half of the whole, and set it to
working,
till it grows red, and then it will be of the colour of Al-Sulfur
(Cinnabar)
which is very red, and the Philosophers have likened it to Gold whose
effects
lead to that which the Philosopher said to his Scholar Arda. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; We call the clay when it is white Yarif, that is
Silver:
But when it is red, we name it Temeynch, that is Gold: Whiteness is
that
which tinges Copper, and makes it Yarit: and it is redness which tinges
Yarit, i.e., Silver and makes it Temeynch. </p>

Work:
Of Decoction, and its Effects</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Know then that the Philosophers have called them
by
divers names: Sometimes they call them Minerals, sometimes Animals,
sometimes
Vegetables, sometimes Natures, for that they are things natural: and
others
have called them by other names at their Pleasures, or as they liked
best. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; But their Medicines are near to Natures, as the
Philosophers
have taught in their Books; for that Nature comes nigh to Nature, and
Nature
is like to Nature, Nature is joined to Nature, Nature is drowned in
Nature,
Nature makes Nature white, and Nature makes Nature red. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; And Corruption is in conjunction with
Generation,
Generation is retained with Generation, and Generation conquereth with
Generation. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; Now for the performance of these things, the
Philosophers
have in their Books taught us how to decoct, and how decoction is to be
made in the matter of our Magistery: This is that which degenerates,
and
changes them from their Substances and Colours, into other Substance
and
Colours. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; If you err not in the beginning you may happily
attain
the end: But you ought t consider the seed of the Earth whereon we
live,
how the heat of the Sun works in it, till the Seed is impregnated with
its influences and Virtues and made to spring, till it grows up to
ripeness:
This is the first change or transmutation. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; After this, Men and other Creatures feed upon it;
and
Nature, by the heat that is innate in Man, changes it again, into
Flesh,
Blood and Bones. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Now like to this is the Operation or Work of our
Magistery,
the Seed whereof (as the Philosophers say) is such that its progress
and
perfection consists in the fire, which is the cause of its Life and
Death. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; Nor is there any thing which comes between the
Body
and the Spirit, but the fire; nor is there any thing mingled therewith,
but the fire which brings the Magistery to its perfection; this is the
truth which I have told you, and I have both seen and done it. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter XXVI</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Of Subtilization, Solution, Coagulation and
Commixion
of the Stone</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Now except you subtilize the Body till it becomes
water,
it will not corrupt and putrefy, nor can it congeal the Fugitive Souls
when the fire touches them; for the fire is that which by its force and
spirit congeals and unties them. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; In like manner the Philosophers commanded to
dissolve
the Bodies, to the end that the heat might enter into their Bowels, or
inward parts: So we return to dissolve these Bodies, and congeal them
after
their solution, with that things which comes near to it, till all the
things
mixed together by an apt and fixt commixtion, in proportional
quantities,
are firmly conjoined together. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; Wherefore we joyn Fire and Water, Earth and Air
together,
mixing the thick with the thin, and the thin with the thick, so as they
may abide together, and their Natures may be changed the one to the
other,
and made like, and one thing in the compound which before were simple. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; Because that part which generates or ferments,
bestows
its virtue upon the subtil and thin, which is the Air; for like cleaves
to its like, and is a part of the Generation, from whence it receives
power
to move and ascend upwards. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Cold has power over the thick matter, because it
has
lost its heat, and the water is gone out of it; and the dryness appears
upon it. This moisture departs by ascending up; and the subtil part of
the Air has mingled itself with it, for that it is like unto it, and of
the same nature. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Now when the thick body has lost its heat and
moisture,
and that the cold and dryness has power over it; and that their parts
have
mixed themselves, by being first divided, and that there is no moisture
left to joyn the parts divided, the parts withdraw themselves. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; And then the part which is contrary to cold, by
reason
it has continued, and sent its heat and decoction to the cold parts of
the Earth, having power over them, and exercising such dominion over
the
coldness which was hidden in the said thick Body; that, by virtue of
its
generative power, changes the thick cold Body, and makes it become
subtil
and hot, and then strives to dry it up again by its heat. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; But afterwards, the subtil part (which causes
the
Natures to ascend), when it has lost its Occidental heat, and waxed
cold,
then the Natures are changes, and become thick, and descend to the
center,
where the earthly Natures are joined together, which were subtilized,
and
converted in their generation, and imbibed in them. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; And so the moisture joyneth together the parts
divided:
But the Earth labours to dry up that moisture, compassing it about, and
hindering it for going out; by means whereof, that which before lay
hid,
does now appear; nor can the moisture be separated, but is held fast,
and
firmly retained by dryness. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; In like manner we see, that whatsoever is in the
World
is held or retained by or with its contrary, as heat with cold, and
dryness
with moisture: thus when each of them has besieged its Companion, the
thin
is mixed with the thick, and those things are made one substance, viz.,
their hot and moist Soul, and their cold and dry Body, are united, and
made one. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; Then it strives to dissolve and subtilize by its
heat
and moisture, which is the Soul; and the Body labours to enclose, and
retain
the hot and moist Soul in its cold and dry substance. And in this
manner
is their Virtues and Properties altered and changed from one thing to
another. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; I have told you the Truth, which I have seen,
and
my own self has done: And therefore I charge you to change or convert
the
Natures from their Substances and Subtilities, with heat and moisture,
into their Substances and Colours. If you proceed aright in this Work,
you must not pass the bounds I have set you in this Book. </p>

  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; When the Body is mingled with moisture, and that
the
heat of the fire meets therewith, the moisture is converted into the
Body,
and dissolves it, and then the Spirit cannot go forth, because it is
imbibed

  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; The Spirits are fugitive, so long as the Bodies
are

therefore these parts can scarcely agree without a good and continua
Operation,
and a steadfast, permanent, and natural heat. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; For the nature of the Soul is to ascend upwards,
where
its Center is; and he that is not able to joyn two or more divers
things
together, whose Centers are divers, knows nothing of this Work. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; But this must be done after the conversion of

Natures, and change of their Substances, and matter, from their natural
Properties, which is difficult to find out. </p>

Cibation, Mundification, and Ablution, with Sweet Water, are most
necessary,
to the Secret of our Magistery. </p>
  <p><b>VII</b>.&nbsp; And if you bestow pains herein, you may cleanse
it
purely; for you must clear it from its blackness and darkness, which
appear
in the Operation. </p>

point
of Volatility and Subtility; and then mix therewith the Souls
dissolved,

  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; You must not be unacquainted with the strength and
proportion
of the fire, for the perfection or destruction of our Stone depends
thereupon:
For Plato said, The fire gives profit to that which is perfect, but
brings
hurt and destruction to that which is Corrupt. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; So that when its quantity or proportion shall be
fit
and convenient, your Work will thrice prosper, and goon as it ought to
do: but if it exceed the measure, it shall without measure corrupt and
destroy it. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; And for this cause it was requisite that the
Philosophers
have instituted several proofs of the strength of their Fires; that
they
might prevent and hinder their burning, and the hurt of a violent heat.
  </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; In Hermes it is said, I am afraid, Father, of the
Enemy
in my house: To whom he made answer: Take the dog of Corascene, and the
bitch of Armenia, and joyn them together; so shall you have a Dog of
the
colour of Heaven. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Dip him once in the Water of the Sea; so will he
become
thy Friend, and defend thee from thine Enemy, and shall go along with
thee,
and help thee, and defend thee where ever thou goest, nor shall he ever
forsake thee, but shall abide with thee forever. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Now Hermes meant by the Dog and Bitch, such
Powers
or Spirits as have power to preserve Bodies, from the hurt, strength,
or
force of the Fire. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; And these things are Waters of Calxes and Slats,

Composition whereof is to be found in the Writings of the Philosophers,

  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Know then that this Work is but one, and it
produceth
one Stone, into which Garib shall not enter, i.e., any strange or
foreign
thing. The Philosopher works with this, and therefrom proceeds a
Medicine
which gives perfection. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Nothing must be mingled therewith, either in
part
or whole: and this Stone is to be found at all times, and in
everyplace,
and about every Man; the search whereof is yet difficult to him that
seeks
it, wheresoever he be. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; This Stone is vile, black, and stinking; it
costs
nothing; it must be taken alone, I is somewhat heavy, and is called the
Original of the World, because it rises up, like things that bud forth;
this is the manifestation and appearance of it, to them that seek truly
after it. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Take it therefore, and work it as the Philosopher
has
told you in the Book, where he speaks of it after this manner. Take the
Stone and no Stone, or that which is not a Stone, neither of the nature
of a Stone; it is a Stone whose Mine is in the top of the Mountains. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; By which the Philosopher understands animals, or
living
Creatures; whereupon he said, Son, go to the Mountains of India, and to
its Caves, and take thence precious Stones, which will melt in the
water,
when they are put into it. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; This Water is that which is taken from other
Mountains
and hollow places; they are Stones and no Stones, but we call them so,
for the resemblance they have to Stones. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; And you must know that the Roots of their Mines
are
in the Air, and their Tops in the Earth; and they make a noise when
they
are taken out of their places, and the noise is very great. Make use of
them very suddenly, for otherwise they will quickly away. </p>

Separated</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Now you must begin to commix the Elements which is
the
compass of the whole Work; there can be no commixtion without a
Marriage
and putrefaction. The Marriage is to mingle the thin with the thick;
and
Putrefaction is to roast, grind, water or imbibe so long, till all be
mixt
together and become one, so that there be no diversity in them, nor
separation,
as in water mixed with water. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; Then will the thick strive to retain the thin,
and
the Soul shall strive with the fire, and endeavor to sustain it, then
shall
the Spirit suffer it self to be swallowed up by the Bodies, and be
poured
forth into them: which must needs be, because the dissolved body, when
it is commixed with the Soul, is also commixed with every part thereof.
  </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; And other things enter into other things,
according
to their similitude and likeness, and both are changed into one and the
same thing: For this cause the Soul must partake with the conveniency,
propensity, durability, hardness, corporeity, and permanency, which the
body had in its complexion. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; The like also must happen to the spirit in this
state
or condition of the Soul and Body: For when the Spirit shall be commixt
with the Soul by a laborious operation, and all its parts wit all the
parts
of the other two, viz., of the Soul and Body; then shall the Spirit and
the said two, be changed into an inseparable substance, whose natures
are
preserved, and their particles, agreed and conjoined perfectly
together. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Whereby it comes to pass, that when this
Compositum
has met with a body dissolved, and that heat has got hold of it, and
that
the moisture which was in it is swallowed up in the dissolved body, and
has passed into it (into its most inward parts) and united or conjoined
itself with that which was of the nature of moisture, it becomes
inflamed,
and the fire defends itself with it. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Then when the fire would enflame it, it will not
suffer
the said fire to take hold of it, to wit, to cleave to it, i.e., to the
Spirit commixt with the water: The fire will not abide by it until it
be
pure. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; And in like manner does the Water naturally fly
from
the Fire, of which when the fire takes hold, it does by little and
little
evaporate. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; And thus is the Body the means to retain the
Water,
and the Water to retain the Oyl, that it might not burn and consume
away,
and the Oyl to retain the Tincture; which is the absolute matter and
cause,
to make the colours appear in that, wherein otherwise there would be
neither
light nor life. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; This then is the true life and perfection of this
great
work, even the work of our Magistery, which we seek after: Be wise and
understand, search diligently, and through the goodness and permission
of God, you shall find what you look for. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Of the Solution of the Stone Compounded, and
Coagulation
of the Stone Dissolved</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; The Philosophers take great pains in dissolving,
that
the Body and Soul might the better be incorporated and united: for all
those things which are in Contrition, Assation, and Rigation, have a
certain
affinity and Alliance between themselves. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; So that the fire may hurt or spoil the weaker
principle
in nature, till it be utterly destroyed, and vanish away, and then it
turns
itself also upon the stronger parts, till it divests the Body of the
Soul,
and so spoils al. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; But when they are this dissolved and congealed,
they
take one another&#8217;s parts, striving in each other&#8217;s mutual defense, as
well
the great as the small, and they incorporate and joyn them well
together,
till they be converted and changed into one and the same thing. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; When this is done, the fire takes as much from
the
Soul as it does from the Body, nor can it hurt the one more than the
other,
neither more nor less, which is a cause of perfection. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; For this reason it is necessary, in teaching the
composition
of the Elixir, to afford one place for expounding the solution of
simple
Bodies and Souls; because Bodies do not enter into Souls, but do rather
prevent and hinder them from Sublimation, Fixation, Retention,
Commixtion
and the like Operations, except purification go before. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Now understand that Solution is done by one of
these
two ways; either by extracting the inward parts of things unto their
Superficies
(an Example whereof we have in Silver, which seems cold and dry, but
being
dissolved so that the inward parts appear outward, it is hot and
moist). </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Or else to reduce it to an accidental moisture
which
it had not before, to be added to its own natural humidity; by which
means
its parts are dissolved: and this is likewise called Solution. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; But as to Congelation, the Philosophers have
said:
Congeal in a Bath, with a good Congelation: This I tell you is Sulphur
shining in Darkness, a Red Hyacinth, a fiery and deadly Poyson, the
Elixir,
the which there is nothing better, a Lyon, a Conqueror, a Malefactor, a
cutting Sword, a healing Antidote, which cure all infirmities and
Diseases. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; And Geber, the Son of Hayen, said: That all the
Operations
of this magistery are comprehended under these six things: (1) To make
fly, or ascend, or sublime. (2) To melt or liquefy. (3) To incinerate.
(4) To make white as Marble. (5) To dissolve. (6) To congeal. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; To make fly, is to drive away and remove blackness
and
foulness from the Spirit and Soul; to melt is to make the body liquid:
To incinerate, is properly to subtilize the Body: To whiten, is to melt
speedily: To dissolve is to separate the parts: And to congeal is to
mix,
joyn, and fix the Body with the Soul already prepared. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; Again, to fly, or to ascend, appertains to both
Body
and Soul; to melt, to increase, to whiten and to dissolve, are
accidents
that belong to the Body: But congelation or fixation, only belongs to,
and is the property of, the Soul: Be wise, understand, and learn. </p>

whether a stone may be made of a thing which buddeth? Answereth, Yea,

is
the Workmanship and Life of him who knows and understands it. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; But he that is ignorant of it, who has not made,
not
knows how it is generated, supposing it to be no Stone, or apprehends
not
in his own mind, all the things I have spoken of it, and yet will
attempt
to compose it, spends away foolishly his precious time, and loses his
Money. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; Except he finds out this precious Treasure, he
finds
indeed nothing, there is no second thing or matter, that can rise up
and
take its place, or stand itself instead thereof; there is no other
Natures
that can triumph over it. </p>
  <p><b>IV.&nbsp;</b> Much heat is the nature thereof, but with a
certain
temperature: If by this saying, you come to know it, you will reap
profit;
but if yet you remain ignorant, you will lose all your labour. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; It has many singular Properties and Virtue in
curing
the Infirmities of Bodies, and their accidental Diseases, and preserves
found Substance, so that there appears not in them any Heterogenities,
or Contrarities: No possibility of the dissolution of their Union. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; It is the Sapo, or Soap of Bodies, yea, their
Spirit
and Soul, which when it is incorporate with them, dissolves them
without
any loss. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; This is the Life of the Dead, and their
Resurrection;
a Medicine preserving Bodies, cleansing them, and purging away their
Superfluities. </p>

that
is ignorant, let him be ignorant still: For this Treasure is not to be
bought with Money, and as it cannot be bought, so neither can it be
sold. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Conceive therefore its Virtue and Excellency
aright,
consider its value and Worth, and then begin to Work: How excellently
speaks
a Learned Philosopher to this purpose? </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; God (saith he) gives thee not this Magistery for
thy
sole Courage, Boldness, Strength or Wisdom, without any labour; but
thou
must labour, that God may give thee success. Adore then God Almighty

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; When you attempt to do this, take this our
precious
Stone and put it into a Curcurbit, covering it with an Alembick, which
c lose well with Lutum Sapientiae, and set it in horse dung, and fixing
a Receiver to it, distill the matter into the Receiver, till all the
water
is come over, and the moisture dryed up, and dryness prevail over it. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; Then take it out dry, reserving the water that is
distilled
for a future occasion; take, I say, the dry body, that remained in the
bottom of the Curcurbit, and grind it, and put it into a Vessel
answerable
in magnitude to the quantity of the Medicine. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; Bury it in as very hot Horse-dung as you can
get,
the vessel being well luted with Lutum Sapientiae: And in this manner
let
it digest. But when you perceive the Dung to grow cold, get other fresh
Dung which is very hot, and put your vessel therein to digest as
before. </p>
  <p><b>IV.&nbsp;</b> Thus shall you do for the space of 40 days,
renewing
your Dung soften as the occasion or reason of the Work shall require,
and
the Medicine shall dissolve of itself and become a thick White water. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Which when you shall see, you shall weigh it, and
put
thereto half so much by weight of the water which you reserved; close
and
lute your vessel well with Lutum Sapientiae, and put it again into hot
Horse-dung (which is hot and moist) to digest, not omitting to renew
the
dung when it begins to cool, till the course of 40 days be expired. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; So will your Medicine be coagulated in the like
number
of days, as before it was dissolved in. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Again, take it, weight it justly, and according
to
its quantity, add to it of the reserved water you made before, grind
the
Body, and subtilize it, and put the water upon it, and set it in hot
Horse-dung
for a Week and a half or ten days; then take it out, and thou shall see
that the Body has already drunk up the Water. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; Afterwards, grind it again, and put thereto the
like
Quantity of your reserved water as you did before; bury it in very hot
Horse-dung, and leave it therefore ten days more, take it out again,
and
you shall see that the Body has already drunk up the Water. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Then (as before), grind it, putting thereto of
the
aforesaid Water, the aforesaid quantity, and bury it in like manner in
hot Horse-dung, digesting it ten days longer, then taking it forth, and
this do the fourth time also. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; Which done, take it forth and grind it, and bury
it
in Horse-dung, till it be dissolved: Afterwards, take it out and
reiterate
the work once more, for then the birth Will be perfect and the Work
ended. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; Now when this is done, and you have brought forth
your
matter to this great perfection, then take of Lead or Steel 250 Drams,
melt, and caste thereon 1 Dram of Cinnabar, to wit, of this our
Medicine
thus perfected, ad it shall fix the Lead or Steel that it shall not fly
the fire. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; It shall make it white, and cleanse it from all
its
dross and blackness, and convert it into a Tincture perpetually
abiding. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.</b>&nbsp; Then take a Dram from these 250 Drams, and
project
it upon 250 Drams of Steel, or Copper, and it shall whiten it and
convert
it into Silver, better than that of the Mine; which is the greatest and
last Work of the White which it performs. </p>
  <p><b>XIV.</b>&nbsp; To convert the said Stone into Red. And if you
desire
to convert this Magistery into Sol, or Gold, take of this Medicine thus
perfected (at # 10 above), the weight of one Dram (after the manner of
the former example), and put it into a Vessel and bury it in Horse-dung
for 40 days till it be dissolved. </p>
  <p><b>XV.</b>&nbsp; Then give it the Water of the dissolved Body to
drink,
first as much as amounts to half its weight, afterwards bury it in hot
Horse-dung, digesting it until it is dissolved, as aforesaid. </p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; If you would be so happy as to obtain the Blessing
of
the Philosophers, as God doth live forever, so let this verity live
with
you. Now the Philosophers say it abides in the Shell, and contains in
itself
both White and Red, the one is called Masculine, the other Feminine;
and
they are Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral, the like of which is not found
in the World besides. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; It has power both Active and Passive in it, and
has
also in it a substance dead and living, Spirit and Soul, which, among
the
ignorant, the Philosophers call the most vile thing: It contains in
itself
the four Elements which are found in its Skirts, and may be commonly
bought
for a small price. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; It ascends by itself, it waxes black, it
descends
and waxes white, increases and decreases of itself: It is a matter
which
the Earth brings forth, and descends from Heaven, grows pale and red,
is
born, dieth, rises again, and afterwards lives forever. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; By many ways it is brought to its end, but its
proper
decoction is by a fire, soft, mean, strong, by various degrees
augmented,
until you are certain it is quietly fixed with the Red in the fire.
This
is the Philosophers&#8217; Stone. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Read, and read again, so will all things become
more
clear to you: But if hereby understand not the matter, you are withheld
by the Chains of Ignorance; for you shall never otherwise know or learn
this Art. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; Hermes saith, The Dragon is not killed, but by
his
Brother and his Sister; not by one of them alone, but by both together:
Note these things: There are three heads, yet but one Body, one Nature,
and one Mineral: This is sufficient for you if you have a disposition
to
understand this Art. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; The Dragon is not mortified, nor made fixed but
with
Sol and Luna and by no other: In the Mountains of Bodies, in the Plains
of Mercury, look for it, there this Water is created, and by the
concourse
of these two, and is called by the Philosophers, their permanent or
fixed
Water. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; Our sublimation is to decoct the Bodies with
Golden
Water, to dissolve, to liquifie, and to sublime them: Our Calcination
is
to purifie and digest in four ways, and not otherwise, by which many
have
been deceived in Sublimation. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Know also that our Brass or Latten, is the
Philosophers
Gold, is the true Gold: But you strive to expel the Greenness, thinking
that our Latten, or Brass, is a Leprous Body, because of that
Greenness,
but I tell you that that Greenness is all that is perfect therein and
all
that is perfect, is in that Greenness only which is in our Latten or
Brass. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; For that Greenness by our Magistery is in a very
little
time transmuted into the most fine Gold: And of this thing we have
experience,
which you may try by the following directions. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; Take burnt, or calcined Brass, and perfectly
rubified:
Grind it, and decoct it with Water, seven times, as much every time as
it is able to drink, in all the ways of Rubifying and Assating it
again. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; Then make it to descend and its green color will
be
made Red, and as clear as a Hyacinth; and so much redness will descend
with it, that it will be able to tinge Argent Vive in some measure,
with
the very color of Gold; all which we have done and perfected, and is
indeed
a very Great Work. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.</b>&nbsp; Yet, you cannot prepare the Stone by any means,
with
any green and moist liquor, which is found and brought forth in our
Minerals;
this blessed might, power or virtue, which generates all things, will
not
yet cause a vegetation, springing, budding forth, or fruitfulness,
unless
there be a Green color. </p>
  <p><b>XIV.</b>&nbsp; Wherefor the Philosophers call it their Bud, and
their
Water of Purification or Putrefaction; and they say truth herein; for
with
its water it is putrefied, and purified, washed from its blackness and
made White. </p>
  <p><b>XV.</b>&nbsp; And afterwards, it is made the highest Red;
whereby
you may learn and understand, that no true Tincture is made but with
our
Brass or Latten. </p>
  <p><b>XVI.</b>&nbsp; Decoct it therefore with its Soul, till the
Spirit
be joined with its Body, and be made one, so shall you have your
desire. </p>
  <p><b>XVII.</b>&nbsp; The Philosophers have spoken of this under many
Names,
but know certainly that it is but one matter which does cleave or joyn
itself to Argent Vive, and to Bodies, which you shall have the true
signs
of: Now you must know what Argent Vive will cleave or perfectly joyn
and
unite itself to. </p>
  <p><b>XVIII.</b>&nbsp; That the Argent Vive will cleave, joyn or
unite
itself to Bodies is false: And they err who think they understand that
pace in Geber of Argent Vive, where he saith, When in searching among
other
things, you shall not find by our Invention, any matter to be more
agreeable
to Nature, than Argent Vive of the Bodies. </p>
  <p><b>XIX.</b>&nbsp; By Argent Vive in this place is understood
Argent
Vive Philosophical; and it is that Argent Vive only which sticks to,
and
is fixed in, and with the Bodies: The old Philosophers could find no
other
matter; nor can the Philosophers now invent nay other matter or thing,
which will abide with the Bodies, but this Philosophic Argent Vive
only. </p>
  <p><b>XX.</b>&nbsp; That common Argent Vive does not stick or cleave
to
the Bodies is evident by Experience, for if common Argent Vive be
joined
to the Bodies, it abides in its proper nature, or flys away, not being
able to transmute the Body into its own nature and substance, and
therefore
does not cleave unto them. </p>
  <p><b>XXI.</b>&nbsp; For this cause, many are deceived in working
with
the vulgar Quicksilver; For our Stone, that is to say, our Argent Vive
accidental, does exalt itself far above mores fine Gold, and does
overcome
it, and kill it, and then makes it alive again. </p>
  <p><b>XXII.</b>&nbsp; And this Argent Vive, is the father if all the
Wonderful
things of this our Magistery, and is congealed, and is both Spirit and
Body: This is the Argent Vive which Geber speaks of, the consideration
of which is of moment, for that it is the very matter which does make
perfect. </p>
  <p><b>XXIII.</b>&nbsp; It is a chosen pure substance of Argent Vive;
but
out of what matter it is chiefly to be drawn, is a thing to be inquired
into. To which we say, That it can only be drawn out of that matter in
which it is: Consider therefore, my son, and see from whence that
Substance
is, taking that and nothing else: By no Principle can you obtain this
Magistery. </p>
  <p><b>XXIV.</b>&nbsp; Nor could the Philosophers ever find any other
matter,
which would continually abide the fire, but this only, which is of an
Unctuous
substance perfect and incombustible. </p>
  <p><b>XXV.</b>&nbsp; And this matter, when it is prepared as it
ought,
will transmute or change all Bodies of a Metallick substance, which it
is rightly projected upon, into the most perfect Sol or most pure fine
Gold; but more easily, and above all other Bodies, Luna. </p>
  <p><b>XXVI.</b>&nbsp; Decoct first with Wind or Air, and afterwards
without
Wind, until you have drawn forth the Venom (or Virtue) which is called
the Soul, out of your matter; this is that which you seek, the
everlasting
Aqua Vitae, which cures all diseases. Now the whole Magistery is in the
Vapour. </p>
  <p><b>XXVII.</b>&nbsp; Let the body be put into a fire for 40 days,
of
Elemental heat: and in that decoction of 40 days, the Body will rejoice
with the Soul, and the Soul will rejoice with the Body and Spirit, and
the Spirit will rejoice with the Body and Soul, and they will be fixed
together, and dwell with one another, in which Life they will be made
perpetual
and immortal without separation forever. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">A Further Explication of This Matter</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; Our Medicine is made of 3 things, viz., of a Body,
Soul,
and Spirit. There are two bodies, to wit Sol and Luna: Sol is a
Tincture,
wherewith imperfect bodies are tinged into Sol; and Luna tingeth into
Luna;
for nature brings forth only its like, a Man a Man, a Horse a Horse,
and
etc. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; We have named the bodies which serve to this
Work,
of which some are called ferment; for as a little leaven leavens the
whole
lump so Sol and Luna, Leaven Mercury as their Meal into their Nature
and
Virtue. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; If it be demanded why Sol and Luna, having a
prefixed
Tincture do not yet tinge imperfect Metals? I answer: A Child though
born
of human kind, acts not the Man, it must first be nourished and bred up
till it comes to Maturity: So it is with Metals also; they cannot show
their power and force, unless they be first reduced from their
Terrestreity
to a Spirituality, and nourished and fed in their Tinctures through
heat
and humidity. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; For the Spirit is of the same matter and nature
with
our Medicine: We say our Medicines are of a fiery nature, and much
subtiler,
but of themselves, they cannot be subtil nor simple, but must be
maturated,
or ripened with subtil and penetrating things. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; Earth of itself is not subtil, but may be made so
through
moist water, which is dissolving, and makes an ingress for Sol, tht it
may penetrate the Earth, and with its heat make the earth subtile; and
in this way the Earth must be subtilized so long, till it be made as
subtil
as a Spirit, which then is the Mercury, more dissolving than common
water,
and apt to dissolve the said Metals, and that through the heat of fire,
to penetrate and subtilize. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; There are several Spirits, as Mercury, Sulphur,
Orpiment,
Arsenick, Antimony, Nitre, Sal-armoniack, Tutia, Marcasites, etc., but
Mercury is a better Spirit than all others; for being put into the fire
they are carried away, and we know not what becomes of them: But
Mercury,
as it is much subtiler, clearer, and penetrative, so it is joined to
the
Metals, and changed into them, whereas the others burn and destroy,
making
them more gross than they were before. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Now Mercury is of such a subtil nature, that it
transmutes
Metal into simple and pure substances as itself is, and attracts them
to
itself: But no Metal can be transmuted by any of the other Spirits, but
they burn it to Earth and Ashes: Which Mercury becomes impalpable, and
therefore is called Argent Vive. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; We take nothing else to subtilize metals, to
make
them penetrative, or to tinge other Metals: Some call it Argent Vive,
or
a Water, an Acetum, a Poyson, because it destroys imperfect Bodies,
dividing
them into several parts and forms; our Medicine is made of two things,
viz., of Body and Spirit: And this is true, that all Metals have but
one
Root and Original. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; But why cannot this Medicine be made of the two
compounded
together? I answer: It may be made of all these together; but they must
be reduced into a Mercury, which would be difficult of the shortness of
Man&#8217;s Life: Therefore we take the next matter, which are the two
aforesaid
things, viz., Body and Spirit. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; Some Philosophers say, our Medicine is made of
four
things, and so it is: For in Metals, and their Spirits are the four
Elements.
Others say true also, That Metals must be turned into Argent Vive: Here
many learned and Wise Men err, and lose themselves in this path. Thus
far
of the matter of which our Medicine is made, or with which it is
joined:
Now of the Vessels. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; The Vessel ought to resemble the Firmament, to
enclose
and encompass the whole Work: For our Medicine is nothing else but a
change
of Elements one into another, which is done by the motion of the
Firmament;
for which reason it must needs be round and circular. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; The other, or second Vessel, must also be round,
and
be less than the outward Vessel: 6 or 7 inches high, called a
containing
Curcurbit; on which you must place an Alembick or Head, through which
the
Vapors may ascend, which must be well luted, with Lute made of Meal,
sifted
Ashes, Whites of Eggs, etc., or of Meal, Calx Vive, and j. part
tempered
with whites Or eggs which you must immediately use: Lute it so well,
that
no Spirits may fly away; the loss of which prejudice your Work
extremely;
therefore be wary. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.</b>&nbsp; The Furnace or Oven must be round, 12 or 14
inches
high, and 6 to 7 inches broad, and 3 or 4 inches in thickness to keep
in
the heat the better. </p>
  <p><b>XIV.</b>&nbsp; Our matter is generated through, or by the help
of
the heat of the fire, through the Vapour of the Water, and also of the
mercury, which must be nourished; be wise and consider, and meditate
well
upon the matter. </p>
  <p><b>XV.</b>&nbsp; Now in order to this work, there is (1)
Dissolution.
(2) Separation. (3) Sublimation. (4) Fixation, or Congelation. (5)
Calcination.
(6) Ingression. </p>
  <p><b>XVI.</b>&nbsp; Dissolution is the changing of a dry thing into
a
moist one, and belongs only to Bodies, as to Sol and Luna, which serve
for your Art: For a Spirit needs only to be dissolved, being a liquid
thing
of itself; but Metals are gross and dry, and of a gross nature, and
therefore
must be subtilized. </p>
  <p><b>XVII.</b>&nbsp; First, because unless they be subtilized
through
dissolution, they cannot be reduced into water, and made to ascend
through
the Alembick, to be converted into Spirit, whose remaining forces are
reserved
for a farther use. </p>
  <p><b>XVIII.</b>&nbsp; Secondly, because the Body and Spirit must be
made
indivisible and one: For no gross matter joyns or mixes with a Spirit,
unless it be first subtilized and reduced into Argent Vive, then the
one
embraces the other inseparably. For Argent Vive meeting with a thing
like
itself, rejoyceth in it; and the dissolved Body embraces the Spirit,
and
suffers it not to fly away, making it to endure the fire; and it
rejoices
because it has found an equal, viz., one like itself, and of the same
nature. </p>
  <p><b>XIX.</b>&nbsp; Dissolution is thus done: Take Leaves of Sol, or
Luna,
to which add a good quantity of pure Mercury; putting in the Leaves by
little and little, into a Vessel places in so gentle a heat, that the
mercury
may not fume: when all is dissolved, and the Mass seems to be one
Homogene
body, you have done well: If there be any faeces, or matter
undissolved,
add more Mercury, till all seems to be melted together. </p>
  <p><b>XX.</b>&nbsp; Take the matter thus dissolved, set it in B.M.
for
7 days, then let it cool: and strain all through a Cloth or Skin; if
all
goes through, the dissolution is perfect; if not, you must begin again,
and add more Mercury, so long till all be dissolved. </p>
  <p><b>XXI.</b>&nbsp; Separation is the dividing or a thing into
parts,
as of pure from impure. We take our dissolved matter, and put it into
the
smaller Vessel which stands in the Curcurbit, well luting to the
Alembick,
and setting it in ashes, continuing the fire for a Week: One part of
the
Spirit sublimes, which we call the Spirit or Water, and is the
subtilest
part; the other which is not yet subtil, sticks about the Curcurbit,
and
some of it falls as it were to the bottom, which is warm and moist,
this
we call the Air. And a third part remaining in the bottom of the inner
Vessel, which is yet grosser, may be called the Earth. </p>
  <p><b>XXII.</b>&nbsp; Each of these we put into a Vessel apart; but
to
the third we put more mercury, and proceed as before, reserving always
each principle or Element apart by itself, and thus proceeding, till
nothing
remains in the inner Vessel, but a black powder, which we call the
black
Earth, and is the dregs of Metals, and the thing causing the
obstruction,
that the Metals cannot be united with the Spirit; this black powder is
of no use. </p>
  <p><b>XXIII.</b>&nbsp; Having thus separated the four Elements from
the
metals, or divided them, you may demand, What then is the fire, which
is
one of these four? To which I Answer: That the Fire and Air are of one
nature, and are mixed together, and changed the one into the other; and
in the dividing of the Elements, they have their natural force and
power,
as in the whole, so in the parts. </p>
  <p><b>XXIV.</b>&nbsp; We call that Air which remained in the bigger
Vessel,
because it is more hot than moist, cold or dry: The same understand of
the other Elements. Hence Plate saith, We turned the moist into dry,
and
the dry we made moist, and we turned the Body into Water and Air. </p>
  <p><b>XXV.</b>&nbsp; Sublimation is the ascending from below upwards,
the
subtil matter arising, leaving the gross matter still below, as he said
before in the changing of the Elements: Thus the matter must be
subtilized,
which is not subtil enough, all which must be done through heat and
moisture,
viz., through Fire and Water. </p>
  <p><b>XXVI.</b>&nbsp; You must then take the thing which remained in
the
greater Vessel, and put it to other fresh Mercury, that it may be well
dissolved and subtilized: set it in B.M. for three days as before. We
mention
not the quantity of Mercury, but leave that to your discretion, taking
as much as you need, that you may make it fusible, and clear like a
Spirit.
But you must not take too much of the Mercury, lest it become a Sea;
then
you must set it again to sublime, as formerly, and do this Work so
often,
till you have brought it through the Alembick, and it be very subtil,
one
united thing, clear, pure, and fusible. </p>
  <p><b>XXVII.</b>&nbsp; Then we put it again into the inner Vessel,
and
let it go once more through the Alembick, to see whether any thing be
left
behind; which if so, to the same we add more Mercury, till it becomes
all
one thing; and leaves no more sediment, and be separated from all its
Impurity
and Superfluity. </p>
  <p><b>XXVIII.</b>&nbsp; Thus we have made out of two, only one thing,
viz.,
out of Body and Spirit, one only cogenerous substance, which is a
Spirit
and light; the Body, which before was heavy and fixed, ascending
upwards,
is become light and volatile, and a mere Spirit: Thus have we made a
Spirit
out of a Body, we must now make a Body out of a Spirit, which is the
one
thing. </p>
  <p><b>XXIX.</b>&nbsp; <i>Fixation</i> or <i>Congelation</i> is the
making
the flowing and volatile matter fixt, and able to endure the fire; and
this is the changing of the Spirit into a Body: We before turned the
dryness
and the Body, into moistness and a Spirit; now we must turn the Spirit
into a Body, making that which ascended to stay below; that is, we must
make it a thing fixed, according to the Sayings of the Philosophers,
reducing
each Element into its contrary, you will find what you seek after,
viz.,
making a fixt thing to be volatile, and a volatile fixt; this can only
be done through Congelation, by which we turn the Spirit into a Body. </p>
  <p><b>XXX.</b>&nbsp; But how is this done? We take a little of the
ferment,
which is made of our Medicine be it Luna or Sol; as if you have 10
ounces
of the Medicine, you take but 1 ounce of the ferment, which must be
foliated;
and this ferment we amalgamate with the matter which you had before
prepared,
the same we put into the Glass Vial with a long Neck, and see it in
warm
Ashes: Then to the said ferment, add the said Spirit which you drew
through
the Alembick, so much as may overtop it the height of 2 or 3 inches;
put
to it a good fire for 3 days, then will the dissolved Body find its
Companion,
and they will embrace each other. </p>
  <p><b>XXXI.</b>&nbsp; Then the gross ferment, laying hold of the
subtil
ferment, attracts the same, joyns itself with it, and will not let it
go;
and the dissolved Body, which is now subtil, keeps the Spirit, for that
they are of equal subtility, and like one to another; and are become so
one and the same thing, that the fire can never be able to separate any
more. </p>
  <p><b>XXXII.</b>&nbsp; By this means you come to make one thing like
another;
the ferment becomes the abiding place of the subtil body, and the
subtil
body the habitation of the Spirit, that it may not fly away. Then we
make
a Fire for a Week, more or less, till we see the matter congealed:
which
time is longer or shorter, according to the condition of the Vessel,
Furnaces,
and Fires you make use of. </p>
  <p><b>XXXIII.</b>&nbsp; When you see the Matter Coagulated, put of
the
above said Matter or Spirit to it, to over it two or three inches,
which
digest as before, till it be coagulated also, and thus proceed, till
all
the Matter or Spirit be congealed. This Secret of the Congelation, the
Philosophers have concealed in their Books, none of them that we know
of
having disclosed it, except only Larkalix, who composed it in many
Chapters;
and also revealed it unto me, without any Reservation or Deceit. </p>
  <p><b>XXXIV.</b>&nbsp; <i>Calcination.</i> We take the known Matter,
and
put it into a Vesica, setting a Head upon it, and luting it well, put
it
into a Sand Furnace, making a continued great Fire for a Week: then the
Volatile ascends into the Alembic which we call Avis Hermetis; that
which
remains in the bottom of the Glass, is like Ashes or sifted Earth,
called,
the Philosophers Earth, out of which they make their Foundation, and
out
of which they make their increase or augmentation, through heat and
moisture. </p>
  <p><b>XXXV.</b>&nbsp; This Earth is composed of four Elements, but
are
not contrary one to another, for their contrariety is changed to an
agreement,
unto an homogene and uniform nature: Then we take the moist part, and
reserve
it a part to a farther use. This Earth, or Ashes (which is a very fixed
thing) we put into a very strong Earthen Pot or Crucible, to which we
lute
its Cover, to which we lute its Cover, and set it in a calcining
Furnace,
or Reverbaratory, for 3 days, so that it always red hot: Thus we make
of
a Stone, a white Calx; and of things of an earthy and watery nature, a
fiery nature: For every Calx is of a fiery nature, which is hot and
dry. </p>
  <p><b>XXXVI.</b>&nbsp; We have brought things to the nature of fire;
we
must now further subtilize the four Elements; we take apart, a small
quantity
of this Calx, viz., a fourth part: The other we set to dissolve with a
good quantity of fresh Mercury, even as we had done formerly (in all
the
Processes of the aforegoing Paragraphs) and so proceed on from time to
time, till it is wholly dissolved. </p>
  <p><b>XXXVII.</b>&nbsp; Now that you may change the fixt into a
Volatile,
that is, Fire into Water, know, that the which was of the Nature of
Fire,
is now become the nature of Water; and the fixt thereby is made
volatile
and very subtil. Take of this water one part, put it to the reserved
Calx;
and add to it as much of the water, as may over top the Calx; and add
to
it as much of the water, as may over top the Calx 2 or 3 inches, making
a fire under it for 3 days; thus it congeals sooner than at first, for
Calx is hot and dry, and drinks up the humidity greedily. </p>
  <p><b>XXXVIII.</b>&nbsp; This Congelation must be continued till all
be
quite congealed; afterwards you must calcine it as formerly; being
quite
calcined, it is called the quintessence, because it is of a more subtil
nature than fire, and because of the Transmutation formerly made. All
this
being done our Medicine is finished, and nothing but Ingression is
wanting,
viz., that the matter may have an Ingress into Imperfect Metals. </p>
  <p><b>XXXIX.</b>&nbsp; Plato, and many other Philosophers, began this
Work
again, with dissolving, subliming, or subtilizing, congealing, and
calcining,
as at first. But this our Medicine, which we call a ferment, transmutes
Mercury into its own nature, in which it is dissolved and sublimed.
They
say also, our Medicine transmutes infinitely imperfect Metals, and that
he who attains once to the perfection of it, shall never have any need
to make more, all which is philosophically to be understood, as to the
first Original Work. </p>
  <p><b>XL.</b>&nbsp; Seeing then that our Medicine transmutes
imperfect
Metals into Sol and Luna, according to the nature and form of the
matter
out of which it is made; therefore we now a second time say, That this
our Medicine is of that nature, that it transmutes or changes,
converts,
divides asunder like fire, and is of a more subtil nature than fire,
being
of the nature of a quintessence as aforesaid, converting Mercury, which
is an imperfect substance, into its own nature, turning the grossness
of
Metal into Dust and Ashes, as you see fire, which does not turn all
things
into its nature, but that which is homogene with it, turning the
heterogene
matter into Ashes. </p>
  <p><b>XLI.</b>&nbsp; We have taught how a Body is to be changed into
a
Spirit; and again how the Spirit is to be turned into a Body, viz., how
the fixed is made volatile, and the volatile fixed again: How the Earth
is turned into Water and Air, and the Air into Fire, and the Fire into
Earth again: Then the Earth into Fire, and the Fire into Air, and the
Air
into Water; and the Water again into Earth. Now the Earth which was of
the nature of Fire, is brought to the nature of a quintessence. </p>
  <p><b>XLII.</b>&nbsp; Though we have taught the ways of transmuting,
performed
through heat and moisture; making out of a dry a moist thing, and out
of
a moist a dry one: otherwise Natures which are of several Properties,
or
Families, could not be brought to one uniform thing, if the one should
be turned into the others nature. </p>
  <p><b>XLIII.</b>&nbsp; And this is the perfection of the matter
according
to the advice of the Philosopher: Ascend from the Earth in Heaven and
descend
from the Heaven to the Earth; to the intent to make the body which is
Earth,
into a Spirit which is subtil, and then to reduce that Spirit which is
subtil, and then to reduce that Spirit into a Body again which is
gross,
changing one Element into another, as Earth into Water, Water into Air,
Air into Fire; and Fire again into Water, and Water into Fire: and that
into a more subtil Nature and quintessence. Thus have you accomplished
the Treasure of the whole World. </p>
  <p><b>XLIV.</b>&nbsp; <i>Ingression</i>. Take Sulphur Vive, Melt it
in
an Earthen Vessel well glazed, and put to it a strong Lye made of Calx
vive and Pot ashes: Boyl gentle together, so will an Oyl swim on the
top,
which take and keep: Having enough of it, mix it with Sand, distil it
through
an Alembic or Retort, so long till it becomes incombustible. With this
Oyl we imbibe Our Medicine, which will be like Soap, then we distil by
an Alembic, and cohobate 3 or 4 times, adding more Oyl to it, if it be
not imbibed enough. </p>
  <p><b>XLV.&nbsp;</b> Being thus imbibed, put fire under it, that the
moisture
may vanish, and the Medicine be fit and fusible, as the body of Glass.
Then take the Avis Hermetis before reserved, and put it to it Gradatim,
till it all becomes perfectly fixt. </p>
  <p><b>XLVI.</b>&nbsp; Now according to Avicen, it is not possible to
convert
or transmute Metals, unless they be reduced to their first Matter; then
by the help of Art they are transmuted into another Metal. The
Alchymist
does like the Physician, who first Purges off the Corrupt or Morbidic
Matter,
the Enemy to Man&#8217;s Health, and then administers a Cordial to restore
the
Vital Powers: So we first Purge the Mercury and Sulphur in Metals, and
then strengthen the Heavenly Elements in them, according to their
various
Preparations. </p>
  <p><b>XLVII.</b>&nbsp; This Nature works farther by the help of Art,
as
her Instrument; and really makes the most pure and fine Sol and Luna:
for
as the heavenly Elemental Virtues work in natural Vessels; even so do
the
artificial, being made uniform, agreeable with nature; and as nature
works
by means of the heats of Fire and of the Bodies, so also Art worketh by
a like temperate and proportionate fire, by the moving and living
virtue
in the matter. </p>
  <p><b>XLVIII.</b>&nbsp; For the heavenly virtue, mixed with it at
first,
and inclinable to this or that is furthered by Art: Heavenly Virtues
are
communicated to their Subjects, as it is in all natural things, chiefly
in things generated by putrefaction, where the Astral Influences are
apparent
according to the capacity of the matter. </p>
  <p><b>XLIX.&nbsp;</b> The Alchymist imitates the same thing,
destroying
one form to beget another, and his Operations are best when they are
according
to nature, as by purifying the Sulphur, by digesting, subliming and
purging
Argent Vive, by an exact mixtion, with a Metallic matter; and thus out
of their Principles, the form of every Metal is produced. </p>
  <p><b>L.</b>&nbsp; The power and virtue of the converting Element
must
prevail, that the parts of it may appear in the converted Element; and
being thus mixed with the Elementated thing, then that Element will
have
that matter which made it an Element, and the virtue of the other
converting
Element will be predominant and remain; this is the great Arcanum of
the
whole Art. </p>

  <p><b>I.</b>&nbsp; This is the true Copy of a Writing found in a
Coffin
upon the Breast of a Religious Man, by a Soldier making a Grave at
Ostend,
to bury some slain Soldiers, Anno 1450. </p>
  <p><b>II.</b>&nbsp; My Dear Brother, if you intend to follow or study
the
Art of Alchymie, and work in it, let me give you warning, that you
follow
not the literal prescripts of Arnoldus nor Raymundus, not indeed of
most
other Philosophers, for in all their Books they have delivered nothing
but figuratively; so that Men not only lose their time, but their Money
also. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b>&nbsp; I my self have studied in these Books for more
than
30 Years, and never could find out the Secret or Mystery by them: But
at
length, through the goodness of God, I have found out one Tincture,
which
is good, true, and absolutely certain, and has restored to me my Credit
and Reputation. </p>
  <p><b>IV.</b>&nbsp; Not knowing (as I do) how much time you have
lost,
and what Wealth you have consumed being touched with it, as a Friend;
and
in regard of our faithful promise to each other in our beginning, to
participate
each of others Fortunes, I have thought it fit, here to persuade you,
not
to lose yourself any longer in the Books of the Philosophers, but to
put
you in the right way, which after long Wanderings I have found out, and
now at this present, I on my Death Bed bequeath you. </p>
  <p><b>V.</b>&nbsp; I advise you to take nothing from it, nor add any
thing
to it; but to do just as I have set it down, and observe these
following
directions; so will you succeed and prosper in the work. </p>
  <p><b>VI.</b>&nbsp; First, Never work with a great Man, lest your
life
come into danger. (2) Let your Earthen Vessel be well made and strong
lest
you lose your Medicine. (3) Learn to know all your Materials, that you
be not cheated with that which is sophisticated and worth nothing. (4)
Let your Fire be neither stronger nor softer, but what is fit, and just
as I have here directed. Let the Bellows and all the other Materials be
your own. (6) Let no man come where you Work, and seem Ignorant to all
such as shall enquire any thing of you touching the Secret. (7) Learn
to
know Metals well, especially Gold and Silver; and put them not into the
Work till they be first purified by our own hands, as fine as may be.
(8)
Reveal not this Secret to any one, but let this Writing be Buried with
you, giving a confirmed charge concerning the same to him you Trust.
(9)
Get a Servant that may be Trusty and Secret, and of a good Spirit, to
attend
you, but never leave him alone. (10) Lastly, when you have ended the
Work,
be Kind and Generous, Charitable to the Poor, publick Spirited, and
return
your Tribute of Thanks to the Great and most Merciful God, the Giver of
all good Things. </p>
  <p><b>VII.</b>&nbsp; Take mineral Quick Silver three pounds (made
neither
of Lead or Tin) and cause an Earthen Pot to be made, well burned the
first
time: glaze it all over except the bottom, the which anoint with hogs
Grease,
and it will not Glaze. This is done, that the Earth of the Quick Silver
may sink to the bottom of the Pot, which it would not do, being glazed,
nor become Earth again. </p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp; The Pot must be made a good foot long, of the
Fashion
of an urinal, with a Pipe in the midst of it: The Furnace must be made
on purpose, that the Pot may go in close to the sides of the Mouth of
the
Furnace: Set it on the Pot a good great Cap or Head, with its Receiver,
without Luting of it, give it a good fire of Coals, till the Pot be all
on fire and very red; then take the fire out quickly, and put in the
Quicksilver
at the Pipe, and then with as much haste as you can, stop it close with
Lute. </p>
  <p><b>IX.</b>&nbsp; Then will the Quick Silver by the heat and force
it
finds, both Break and Work; a part thereof you shall see in the Water,
as it were a few drops; and a part will stick to the bottom of the Pot
in black Earth: Now let the Pot cool within the Furnace, as it is, then
open it, and you shall find the Quick Silver in it all Black, which you
must take out, and wash very clean, and the Pot also. </p>
  <p><b>X.</b>&nbsp; As for the Water which does distill out, put it
aside,
or cast it away, for it is worth nothing, because it is all Phlegm. Set
the Pot into the Furnace again, and make it red hot; put in the
Quicksilver,
lute well the Pipe, and do as you did the first time, and do this so
often,
until the Mercury becomes no more black, which will be in ten or eleven
times. </p>
  <p><b>XI.</b>&nbsp; Then take it out, and you shall find the Mercury
to
be without Phlegm, but joined with Earth, of which two Qualities it
must
be freed, being&nbsp; Enemies to Nature; thus the Quick Silver will
remain
pure, in color Celestial like to Azure, which you may know my this
sign,
viz., Take a piece of Iron, heat it red hot, and quench it in this
Mercury,
and it will become soft and white, like Luna. </p>
  <p><b>XII.</b>&nbsp; Then put the Mercury into a Retort of Glass,
between
two Cups, so that it touches neither bottom or sides of the Cups, and
make
a good fire under it, and lay Embers on the top, the better to keep the
heat of the fire; and in 40 hours the Mercury will Distill into a slimy
Water (hanging together) which will neither wet your hands, nor any
other
things, but Metals only. </p>
  <p><b>XIII.</b>&nbsp; This is the true Aqua Vitae of the
Philosophers;
the true Spirit so many have sought for, and which has been desired of
all Wise Men, which is called the Essence, Quintessence, Powers,
Spirit,
Substance, Water and Mixture of mercury, and by many other the like
Names,
without strange things, and without offense to any Man. </p>
  <p><b>XIV.</b>&nbsp; Save well this precious Liquor or Water,
obscured
by all Philosophers, for without it you can do no good or perfect Work:
Let all other things go, and keep this only; for any one that sees this
Water, if he has any Practice or Knowledge, will hold to it, for it is
Precious and worth a Treasure. </p>
  <p><b>XV.</b>&nbsp; Now resteth to make the Soul, which is the
perfection
of the Red, without which you can neither make Sol nor Luna, which
shall
be Pure and Perfect: With this Spirit you may make things Apparent and
Fair, yea, most True and Perfect; all Philosophers affirm that the Soul
is the substance, which sustains and preserves the Body, making it
Perfect
as long as it is in it. </p>
  <p><b>XVI.</b>&nbsp; Our Body must have a Soul, otherwise it would
neither
move nor work; for which reason you must consider and understand, that
all Metals are compounded of Mercury and Sulphur, Matter and Form;
Mercury
is the matter, and Sulphur is the Form. According to the pureness of
Mercury
and Sulphur, such is the Influence they assume. </p>
  <p><b>XVII.</b>&nbsp; Thus Sol is engendered of most pure fine
Mercury,
and a pure red Sulphur, by the Influence of the Sun; and Luna is made
of
a pure fine Mercury, and a pure white Sulphur by the Influence of the
Moon. </p>
  <p><b>XVIII.</b>&nbsp; Thence it is that Luna is more pure than the
other
five Metals, which have need of cleansing; being cleansed, they need
but
only the pure Sulphur, with the help of Sol and Luna, Sulphur is the
Form
of Sol and Luna, and the other Metals; their other parts are gross
matters
of Sulphur and Mercury. </p>
  <p><b>XIX.</b>&nbsp; Husband-men know many times more than we do:
They
when they reap their Corn growing on the Earth, gather it with the
Straw
and Ears. The Straw and Ears are the Matter, but the Corn or Grain is
the
Form or Soul. </p>
  <p><b>XX.</b>&nbsp; Now when they sow their Corn, when they sow not
the
Matter, which is the Straw and the Chaff, but the Corn or Grain, which
is the Form or Soul: So if we will reap Sol or Luna, we must use their
Form or Soul, and not the matter. </p>
  <p><b>XXI.</b>&nbsp; The Form or Soul is made by God&#8217;s help, after
this
manner. You must make a good Sublimate, that is seven times sublimed;
the
last time of the seven you must sublime it with Cinnabar without
Vitriol,
and it will be a certain Quintessence of the Sulphur of that Antimony. </p>
  <p><b>XXII.</b>&nbsp; When this is done, take of the finest Sol one
Ounce,
or of the finest Luna as much, file it very fine, or else take leaf
Gold
or Silver; then take of the aforesaid Sublimate four ounces; sublime
them
together for the space of 16 hours; then let it cool again, and mix
them
all together, and sublime again: Do this four times, and the fourth
time,
it will have a certain Rundle, like unto the Matter of the White Rose,
transparent and most clear as any Orient Pearl, weighing about Ounces. </p>
  <p><b>XXIII.</b>&nbsp; The sublimate will stick to the brims and
sides
of the Vessel, and in the bottom it will be like good black Pitch,
which
is the Corruption of Sol and Luna. </p>
  <p><b>XXIV.&nbsp;</b> Take the Rundle aforesaid, and dissolve it in
most
strong Spirit of Vinegar, two or three times, by putting it into an
Urinal,
and setting it in B.M. for the space of three days every time pouring
it
into a new Spirit of Vinegar, as at the first, till it be quite
dissolves:
Then distill it by a filter, and save that which remains in the Pot,
for
it is good to whiten Brass. </p>
  <p><b>XXV.</b>&nbsp; That which passed the filter with the Vinegar,
set
upon hot Ashes, and evaporate the Moisture and Spirit of Vinegar with a
soft fire, and set it in the Sun, and it will become most White, like
unto
White Starch; or Red if you work with Sol; which are the Form, or Soul
or Sulphur of Luna and Sol, and will weigh a quarter of an Ounce,
rather
more than less, save that well. </p>
  <p><b>XXVI.</b>&nbsp; Take an Urinal half a foot high, and take of
the
firm body five Ounces; of the Soul or Sulphur of Sol or Luna, a quarter
of an Ounce; and of the Spirit four Ounces: Put all of them into the
Urinal,
and put on its head or Cover, with its Receiver well closed or Luted.
Distill
the Water from it, with a most soft Fire, and there will come off the
first
time, almost three Ounces. </p>
  <p><b>XXVII.</b>&nbsp; Put the Water on again, without moving the
Urinal,
and distil it again, until no more liquor will distill, which do 6 or 7
times, and then every thing will be firm. Then set the same Urinal in
Horse-dung
seven days, and by the virtue and subtility of the heat, it will be
converted
into water. </p>
  <p><b>XXVIII.</b>&nbsp; Distil or filter this water, with stripes or
shreds
of Woolen-cloth: a gross part will remain in the bottom, which is worth
nothing: All that which is passed the filter congeal, which will be
about
4 or 5 ounces, and save it. When you have congealed it three times,
melt
ten ounces of the most fine Sol or Luna, and when it is red hot, put
upon
it 4 ounces (one Copy said 13 ounces) of this Medicine, and it will be
all true and good Medicine. </p>
  <p><b>XXIX.</b>&nbsp; Likewise melt Borax and Wax, ana one ounce, to
which
put of the former Medicine 1 ounce: Put all these upon Mercury, or any
other Metal 3 pound, and it will be most fine Sol or Luna, to all
Judgments
and Assays. Thus have I ended this process, in which, if you have any
practice
or judgment, and know how to follow the Work, you may finish it, or
compleat
it in 40 days. </p>
  <p><b>XXX.</b>&nbsp; <i>An Appendix teaching how to make Aurum
Potabile</i>.
Take Sal Armoniac, Sal nitre, ana 1 pound: beat them together, and make
thereof an A.R.: Then take of the most fine Sol q.v. in thin leaves,
and
cut into very small pieces, which roll into very thin rolls, and put
them
into an Urinal, or like Glass, to which put the A.R., so much as to
overtop
it the depth of an inch. </p>
  <p><b>XXXI.</b>&nbsp; Then nip up the Glass, and put it to putrefy in
Sand,
with a gentle heat, like that of the Sun for3 or 4 days, in which time
it will come to dissolution; then break the Glass off at the Neck, and
pouring off the A.R. easily and leisurely, leave the dissolved Sol in
the
bottom, and repeat this work with fresh A.R., 3 or 4 times, and keep
the
first water, then put on a Helm with Lute, and distill off in Sand:
Being
cold break the Glass, and take the Sol, and wash it 3 or 4 times in
pure
warm water. </p>
  <p><b>XXXII</b>.&nbsp; When the Sol is clean from the A.R., take of
it,
and put it into the like Glasses, with rectified S.V. 2 or 3 inches
above
it; put it into putrefaction as before in Sand, stopping the mouth
thereof
very close for 3 or 4 days; then put the S.V. out, which will be all
blood
red. If any thing remains in the Glass undissolved, put in more S.V.
and
let it stand as before. Do this as long as you find any Tincture
therein.
This is Aurum Potabile. </p>
  <p><b>XXXIII.</b>&nbsp; But if you would have the Tincture alone,
distill
off the S.V. with a very gentle fire, and you shall find the Tincture
at
the bottom of the Glass, which you may project upon Luna. </p>
