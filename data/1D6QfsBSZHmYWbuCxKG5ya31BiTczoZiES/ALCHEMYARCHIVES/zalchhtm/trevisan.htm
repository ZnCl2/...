The first thing requisite in this Science of Transmutation is the
knowledge
of the Matter, from whence is extracted the Argent vive and the Sulphur
of the Philosophers; of which two the Sovereign Medicine is made and
constituted. </p>
  <p>The Matter from whence is extracted the Sovereign Medicine and
Secret
of the Philosophers, is only most fine Gold and most fine Silver and
Argent
Vive, all which thou seest daily altered nevertheless, and moved by
artifice
in the nature of a Matter White and dry in the manner of a Stone, from
whence our Argent Vive and Sulphur are elevated and extracted by strong
ignition by reiterate destruction of the same, by resolution and
sublimation,
and in this Argent Vive is the Air and Fire which cannot be beheld by
Corporeal
Eyes, being subtile and Spiritual which makes against those who think
to
obtain four Elements really and visibly separated in the Work, each one
apart, but such know not the nature of things, and that simple Elements
cannot be obtained by us, although we know them by their operations and
effects which are found in these lower elements, to wit Earth and
Water,
as they are altered from a compact and gross nature, whereby they are
moved
from one nature to another. That Sol and Luna are the Matter of our
Blessed
Stone, the sayings of all Philosophers confirm, and in real truth saith
our Father Hermes, "The Sun is the Father and the Moon is the Mother",
but great doubt is made of the third Composition, to wit what is the
Argent
Vive of which with the Sol and Luna our Composition is made. Which to
know,
it is to be noted that the Philosophers divided into two parts, First
and
Second. That Second part is by Philosophers divided into the White
Stone
accomplished, and into the Red Stone. </p>
  <p>But because this notable Secret lies in knowing the First Part,
Philosophers
doubting to reveal this Secret have made but little mention of the
First
Part, and believe that if it had not been to prevent the Science of
Philosophers
would have remained as wholly false in its principles, they would have
been entirely silent and have mentioned nothing of it; Wherefore if
they
had not in any manner touched upon, the Science would have in all
points
rested in Ignorance and perished, as being false in its terms. </p>
  <p>As this is the beginning, the Key, the Foundation of our
Magistery,
without which nothing is to be accomplished, and that being unknown, ye
Science would remain deceitful and false in practice. To the end that
this
great Secret might not remain unknown, which is the Stone, to which
nothing
strange or foreign is to be added, I have designed to make some mention
of it, wholly, certainly and true, which I have seen and possessed, God
of Truth being my witness, which I commit to the Secret Cabinet of the
pious Soul, upon peril of the same, wherefore Philosophers have called
this Secret Verbum Dismissum, which is to say a word left or concealed.
It is then to be known that the Philosophical work is to be divided
into
three degrees, to wit --- the Vegetable, Mineral and Animal Stone. The
Vegetable Stone properly and principally the Philosophers have
attributed
to this First, which is the Stone of the First Degree, of which Peter
of
Villaneauve (Brother of Arnold) saith in his Rosary, "The beginning of
our Stone is Argent Vive or its Sulphurity which we must obtain from
its
gross corporeal substance before we can pass to the Second Degree". </p>
  <p>The beginning of our Stone is, that Mercury growing like a tree,
be
composed and sublimed by opening it for the volatile germ, or seed,
which
cannot nourish nor grow without the Fixed Tree that retains it, as the
living nipple of an Infant. </p>
  <p>It appears then that this Stone is Vegetable, as it were, the
sweet
Spirit that proceeds from the Bud of the Vine joined in the Work, first
to a Body, fixed and whitening as is said in the Green Dream wherein
after
the Text of Alchemy is very notably described the practice of this
Vegetable
Stone to those who wisely discern the Truth, which for certain reasons
and just cause I forbear to set down here. </p>
  <p>The First Degree then of our Philosophical Stone, is to make Our
Mercury
Vegetable, clean and pure, which is called by Philosophers White
Sulphur
not burning, which is the means of conjoining Sulphur with Bodies, and
Mercury, truly and really, that he may be of one nature, fixed, subtle,
clean and united to the Bodies in their profundity, by the help of
their
heat and moisture, of which Philosophers say, Tinctures may be
conjoined,
but not Argent Vive Vulgar, that being cold and phlegmatic and
destitute
of lively operation, which consists in heat and moisture, but because
it
is in part volatile, therefore it is the medium to fix volatile
spirits,
and to adhere or adjoin to the fixed substances of Bodies, wherein is
touched
the cause of its necessity, which is threefold. The first as we are to
join the two Seeds, to wit, Male and Female, they ought to be mingled
with
each other by a natural alliance and Love, and by a continual
sponginess,
in such manner that the moist of one be attracted by the moist of the
other
and by consequence the one be mixed with the other and that they be
joined
together, and for as much as those two Bodies, to wit Gold and Silver
are
made moist by heat digesting, dissolving and subtilizing, then they are
the First Matter and simple, and take upon them the name of Seed, which
are near to generation, through the impression they receive by their
simplicity
and obedience to instrumental heat, equivalent and like to the natural
heat of this Mercury, forming and sealing thereto a kind of Elixir, for
that the First Part of the Stone is called Elixir. The First Part then
is the medium of conjoining extremities of the Vessel of Nature, in
which
Vessel the Spirits ought to be transmitted as they proceed from one
nature
to another, wherein is touched the Second Part of its necessity, for as
the Stone ought to be impregnated with Spirits, it is necessary there
should
be therein a retentive faculty or Virtue embraced by them, to the end
that
they may be mixed with the Body in the smallest parts. This Virtue is
truly
found in our Philosophical Mercury, as it is in part of a Spiritual
nature,
so is truly a pure Spirit, impregnated and purified from all feculent
and
terrestrial resident Spirits. I say true and fixed in one part for it
contains
the nature of the one and of the other Fire, which manifests and
declares
its ponticity or compunctuous sharpness, which appears in its
operation,
for by this Mercury mortified is easily congealed, the Mercury of the
Vulgar,
as the Text declares. Nevertheless it is not fixed by itself, but ought
to be conjoined with Sol and Luna and be married in friendship and to
the
end, that which is not in it, may be fixed by those Bodies, to wit,
that
this thing which is composed of several mixtures together with their
co-naturals,
may directly fix the Mercury of the Vulgar, for which cause no Bodies
are
mixed which fixed, to the end that the compounded Fire, which is called
Mercury sublimed philosophically or First matter, may be informed by
proper
Ferments, as to obtain the force more lastingly, and persevere the
contest
of the Fire notwithstanding its asperity, wherefore, saith Hortulanus,
"That is not strange to it, to which it ought to be conjoined", viz.,
fixed.
And of this Mercury saith Raymond, "The Argent Vive by us made,
congealeth
the common, and is more common to men than the common, of less price,
of
greater virtue and utility, and also of greater retention, being a Gum
more noble than Pearls, which converts and attracts to its fixed nature
all other Gums clear and pure, and enables them to resist in the Fire,
and to rejoice therein", wherefore saith Morienus, "Those who would
obtain
this composition without this First Part are like those who would mount
to the height of a pinnacle without a ladder, who when they begin to
climb
find themselves cast down to the bottom in misery and pair. This
Mercury
exuberate then is the first beginning and Foundation of our glorious
Magistery,
for it contains in itself Fire which ought to be replenished and
nourished
with a great and strong Fire in the Second Regimen of our Stone, now as
well the Fire enclosed in our said Mercury by the First Regimen, as the
Fire which ought to be inclosed by the Second is by Philosophers named
the proper Instrument, which is the Second thing principally required
to
be understood in this high Magistery in such manner that the Matter
Volatile
and fixt by heat and congelation, with dissolution of the bodies as
Philosophers
teach, for the greatness of the Magistery have veiled under another
name,
to wit, Sublimation or Exaltation of the Mercurial matter, as it is
exalted
in its noble Virtues, and Sublimed in its degrees. "Wherefore", saith
Arnold,
"Let Mercury first be sublimed, that is, as Mercury is in nature low
and
base condition to wit, Earth and Water, let it be brought to a more
noble
and higher condition, to wit Airy and Fiery, which are principles near
approaching to this Mercury in the intention of Art and Nature".
Wherefore
when this Mercurial Stone is thus Exalted and Subtilized, it is said to
be sublimed in its First Sublimation, which is convenient to sublime
with
its Vessel, as saith Raymond in his Codicil in the beginning Chapter 2
of <i>Vade Mecum de Mercurale Philosophorum</i>. We hope in God that
our
Mercury shall be sublimed to greater things which tinge it, and its
Soul
shall be exalted into Glory, as being that which it behooves to enter
into
its Mother&#8217;s Belly, also it is said to be born of the First Nativity,
which
hath regards to all orders of the Chemical Earth, and the heart of the
workers in this Art shall not be frustrated of joy, and shall tell
thee,
calling God to witness, that as this mercury hath been by some one
sublimed,
it hath appeared cloathed with so great Whiteness as the Snow on the
highest
mountains, under a most subtile, crystalline splendour, from whence
proceeds
at the opening of the Vessel, so great, so sweet, so excellent an
odour,
as the like is not to be found under the World, and I who speak this
know
that this most marvelous Whiteness has appeared to my own eyes, and
have
handled this attenuated and subtilized, crystalline Matter with my own
hands, and with my own sense of smelling have smelt this marvelous
sweetness,
and with great joy begun to shed tears upon the astonishment of
marvelousness
and sweetness, for which Blessed be the Eternal God, most High, and
Glorious
who hath hidden these marvelous Great Secrets of nature, yet hath
vouchsafed
to a few I know (most Reverend Father) that when you shall be
acquainted
with the causes of this disposition you will admire that a Matter so
corrupt
should contain in itself such a heavenly like nature, I am not
sufficient
to declare to you these Wonders, yet the time may come (if it be found
expedient) that I may acquaint you with many particular matters of this
nature, which her to write I have not obtained permission from the God
of Nature. </p>
  <p>Of this Celestial nature, it is said in the Book of Prognosticks,
certainly
in Medicine, Celestial Gifts are found, but to proceed further, when
you
have sublimed this Mercury, take fresh and new with its Blood or
Ferment,
that it may not grow old or stale. Present it to its Parents, Luna and
Sol to the end that of these three things, to wit Sol, Luna and Mercury
our Composition may be made, and that the Second Degree of our Stone
may
begin. </p>
  <p>The Second Degree, if thou wouldst have then good multiplication
in
the strongest qualities and mineral virtues by the operation of the
Second
Degree, and the help of Nature. </p>
  <p>Take the clean Bodies and with them unite the said Mercury in such
weight
or proportion, as is known to the masters of this magistery, and to
conjoin
the said dry Matter (or Sulphur) which is the Sulphur of the Elements,
and which is called Oil of Nature, and Mercury sublime, subtilized,
dissolved
and hardened by the operation of the First Degree in rejecting
nevertheless
all the residue and Faeces, that is made in sublimation, as of no
value.
But it is not to be understood in our sublimation the thing sublimed
should
remain in the top of the vessel, as it happens in the sublimation of
Sophisters,
but in our sublimation what is sublimed is a little elevated above the
Faeces of the vessel and sustains itself and is joined to the sides of
the vessel, and that which is foul and impure remains in the bottom, by
Nature which desires to lose of its own accord, by a certain manner of
evacuation, to the end it may be restored in melioration, in losing its
impure parts that it may recover pure and better by which parts the
third
cause of its necessity, which is that as Mercury is clean white,
incumbustible
it illuminated our Stone and defends it from adjustion, and keeps it
from
burning temporals and moderates the excessive ardour of Fire against
Nature,
reducing and bringing it back to a true Temperature and concord with
the
Natural Fire. </p>
  <p>For the Philosophical Mercury contains an excellency of the fire
in
natural and sovereign virtue of which is to qualify against the heat of
the Fire against Nature, naturalizing that is converting itself, or
making
itself natural by sweetly, according to the natural Fire, which is a
great
increase known to few. </p>
  <p>Wherefore here Mercury is called the Earth or Nurse in this part,
as
it is the Matter or Sperm, without which the Stone cannot grow or
multiply,
whereof saith Hermes, "Ye Nurse of our Stone is the Earth (of Mercury)
of which Sol is the Father and Luna the Mother, it mounts from Earth to
heaven, again descends to the Earth, of which the strength is entire,
if
it be turned to Earth, which Earth and the two perfect Bodies, the
right
composition of the Philosophical takes birth and beginning". </p>
  <p>Let these two Bodies then be sufficient for thee, being such as
are
sought and required, as saith Arnold de Villa Nova, that as the end of
the state is perfection it perfects the Mercury of the Vulgar and other
imperfect Bodies and transmutes them. We must then&nbsp; necessarily
acquire
this virtue which is found where it is, now it is likely no ways better
to be found than in perfect Bodies, for if in Bodies pure and fine
there
be not force and virtue to transmute imperfect Metals into perfect and
true Sol, in vain should we seek it in the base, the like say of Lune
and
all imperfect Metals, Sol and Luna only are perfect, and all the rest
are
imperfect. </p>
  <p>To obtain then this mercurial substance, wherewith all the perfect
virtue
to transmute into Sol and Lune the imperfect metals, you must have
recourse
to the two perfect Bodies and no other. Wherefore it is to be known,
that
the conjunction of these two Bodies is the natural term of the last
subtilization
and of Transmutation of the First Matter of Regeneration, because of by
this conjunction, by the first simple Matter is made generation of the
true Elixir. Lune reduced into its First Matter is the passive matter,
for truly, she is the wife of Sol and he is her husband, that is in
very
near affinity to each other, such is the conveniency between the Male
and
the Female in this kind of Art, of both which is engendered Sulphur
White
and Red , glutinous and congealing Mercury certainly better creation
and
nearer transmutation is made, when the proper Male is joined to its
proper
Female into one nature, and the Male joins most profoundly in the
passive
Matter by the subtility of its nature, and transmutes it more,
converting
its nature into another nature, and transmutes it more, converting its
nature into another nature, to wit, into the nature of Sulphur; of
which
conjunction saith Dastin, "If the White Woman be married to her Red
Husband
they incontinently embrace one another, and are joined together. They
are
dissolved by themselves that these which were two might be made one
Body".
This copulation is the philosophical marriage and indissolvable Bond,
wherefore
it is said also, where these two Bodies are made one by conjunction,
that
they may hold one nature, to wit, our Mercury, which is by some called
the Ring or Sovereign Bond, also it is called the Daughter of Platon,
which
conjoin Bodies assembled in Love. Compose then this our Stone of these
three things, and not any other, for in other matters is not lodged
that
which so many do seek. This amalgam, or Philosophical composition thus
ordered, it may be truly said of it, that the Stone is made but of one
Thing. For this composition is a mixture of inestimable price and
value,
that is of such a price as cannot be sufficiently thought. </p>
  <p>This is our Brass, that is our amalgam or composition, made of the
above
said three things or Matter only, and then begins the second part of
our
most noble Stone, and the stone of the Second Degree which is called
Mineral. </p>
  <p>Now it is to be noted, that by the Second Regimen or Operation,
the
Stone of Mercury which was born by the First Operation, so clear and
resplendent,
is mortified, blackened and made vile and ugly, in fire, is so deformed
with the whole compound, that is may revive with great victory, with
great
clarity, purity and force than it had first, For this mortification is
vivifying, for in mortifying it revives itself. </p>
  <p>And certainly these two Operations are so chained and interlaced
one
with another, that one cannot be without the other, as appears in the
doctrine
of Philosophers, for the corruption of one is the generation of the
other. </p>
  <p>All this business then is nothing else but to create Sulphur of
Nature
and reduce the composition to its First Matter of the Metallick kind,
for
as Albertus saith in his <i>Book of Minerals</i>; "We must not so much
alter or distance our Stone from the nature of Metals". Know then that
this Compound is the substance out of which ought to be drawn the
Sulphur
of nature by comforting it, and nourishing it in joining to this
substance
the Mineral Virtue, to the end it may be made a new Nature stript from
all its Sulphureous terrestricity and corruption and all phlegmatic
humidity,
hindering digestion. It is further to be observed that according to the
divers alterations or change of the one and the same Matter in
digestion,
divers names are imposed on it by the Philosophers according to its
divers
complexions, some have called it a coagulating pressure, some Azoc,
Arsenic,
others Album and tincture illuminating all bodes, some have called it,
Philosophical Egg, for a Egg is composed of three parts, viz., Shell,
White,
and the Yolk, so is compounded out Philosophical Egg, or Body, Soul and
Spirit. Although in truth our Stone is but one thing according to Body,
Spirit and Soul, but according to the divers reason and intentions of
Philosophy,
is now called one Thing, and then another, which Plato meant when he
said,
"The Matter flows infinitely or always, if the Form stay not its flux",
so is it Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, for there is Body,
Soul
and Spirit. There is also Sulphur, Mercury and Arsenick, for the Soul
breathing,
that is casting out its Vapours by Arsenick Works in conjoining Mercury
of which philosophers say that the property of Arsenick is to breathe,
or respire, the property of Sulphur is to coagulate or congeal Mercury,
nevertheless this Sulphur, this Arsenick and this Mercury are not those
the vulgar think of which are not those venomous Spirits the
Apothecaries
sell, but the Spirits of the Apothecaries are those vulgar Spirits,
theirs
are more of imperfection and corruption, to prejudice rather than
repair
imperfect Metals. Wherefore it cannot give perfection and incorruption
to them, which perfection ought to be given by our Medium, Vainly
therefore
do those Sophisters work, who endeavor to make the Elixir, from such
venomous
Spirits full of corruption. For certainly, in no other thing is lodged
the Truth of the Sovereign subtility of Nature, but in the three
matters
above said, to wit, Sulphur, Arsenick and Mercury Philosophical wherein
the reparation and total perfection of Bodies that are to be purged,
lodges,
only all the Philosophers have imposed divers names on our Stone.
Wherefore
leave the plurality of names and regard only the compound, which is but
once to be placed in one Vessel, from whence it is not to be taken till
the Elementary Rotations be accomplished, that the force and active
Virtue
of our Mercury should be nourished and not be suffocated and entirely
lost,
for the seeds of Vegetables in the Earth are not propagated by growth
and
multiplication if their force and generative Virtue be taken from them
by any strange quality whatsoever. In like manner also, this nature
will
not multiply, or be multiplied if it be not prepared in manner of
Water. </p>
  <p>The Matrix of the mother after Conception remains shut up or the
Fruit
will be lost, so our Stone ought always to remain closed in its Vessel,
nor any strange thing ought to be added, but only should be nourished
and
informed by the Formative Virtue of its multiplicative Virtue, not only
in quantity but greatly in quality, in such maner must be influenced or
put into the said Matter, the vivifying Humidity by virtue whereof it
is
nourished, increased and multiplied. </p>
  <p>After then our Compound is made, the first thing to be done is to
animate
it, putting to it the natural heat, or vivifying humidity, or the Soul,
Air or life. By the work of solution or sublimation with congelation,
and
as you have made thy compound so must thou have a certain manner of
proceeding
according to the internal heat enclosed in the matter, otherwise it may
remain void of its designed end, without Soul, deprived of its noble
high
virtues, and would have no motion to generation as other things by
nature
produced. The manner how to put Fire into the said Matter, and to
convert
it from disposition to disposition, from nature to nature, that is from
low to high degree. The manner of this disposition is made by proper
sublimation,
Impregnation, mortification for Resurrection and Sublimation in the
light
Elements, so that all the circle of this noble Magistery is nothing but
sublimation perfect, which nevertheless hath many particular operations
annexed, chained, interlaced or joined together, but two are
principally
attending the whole Circle, which are perfect dissolution and perfect
coagulation.
So that the whole Magistery is perfectly to dissolve, and perfectly to
congeal, dissolve the Body and congeal the Spirit, and this operation
has
ties and alliances together, that the Body never dissolves but the
Spirit
congeals, nor also the Spirit congeals not, except the Body be
dissolved.
As Raymond and all the Philosophers say, that the whole Magistery is
nothing
but Dissolution and Congelation by the Ignition, of which Operation
many
great and learned in this Science have been deceived, thinking to
understand
by confidence in their learning, the Circles of Nature, and the manner
of Circulation. </p>
  <p>It is then expedient to understand the manner of this Circulation,
which
verily is nothing else but to imbibe, refresh, or moisten the Compound
in due weight or proportion with our Mercurial Water, which
Philosophers
command to be called Permanent Water, in which Imbibitions the Compound
is digested and congealed to its natural accomplishment. </p>
  <p>T&#8217;is most certain, that if Earth is to be made Fire, it must be
subtilized
or prepared, that it may be brought to greater simplicity, so is the
Compound
attenuated and subtilized, until the Fire bear rule therein. </p>
  <p>And this Sublimation of Earth is made by Subtile Water, most
highly
sharp and penetrating, not having any feculency or odour, as Geber said
in his Summary, "Such is the Water of our Argent Vive, sublimed and
brought
back to the nature of Fire, under the Vive, sublimed and brought back
to
the nature of Fire, under the name of Vinegar, Alum, Salt and many
other
sharp Liquors and other like things (even until now hid and covered),
by
which Waters bodies are subtilized, reduced and brought back to their
First
Matter, neighboring Stone, or Elixir of Philosophers, where it is to be
known that as the Infant in the Mother&#8217;s Belly ought to be nourished
with
natural nourishment, which is Menstrual Blood, to the end it may be
increased
and grow in quantity and stronger in quality, so ought our Stone to be
nourished with its Fatness (as saith Aristotle) of its own proper
nature
and substance, but what this fatness is that is the nourishment of
life,
increase, and multiplication of our Stone the Philosophers have wholly
concealed it, as being the greatest Secret they have sworn never to
reveal
or make manifest to anyone, otherwise than their writings declare, but
have remitted it to the hand of God alone, to reveal or conceal as it
shall
please Him". Nevertheless this fat and viscous humidity, vivifying or
giving
Life, the Philosophers have called Mercurial Water, or Oil Permanent, a
Water abiding the Fire and also a Divine Water, and is the Key and
Foundation
of the whole Work, and this Mercurial Water impregnated and permanent,
it is said in <i>Turba</i>, "That Bodies must be wrought by flame of
Fire
that they may be broken, torn and debilitated", to wit, by this Water
full
of Fire wherein the Perfect Bodies are so much washed as it is
dissolved
and made Water, which is not Water of the Clouds, or Fountain Water, as
think the ignorant and foolish Sophisters: But this our Permanent Water
which cannot yet be made permanent without the Body with which it is
joined,
that it resists the Fire without flying, wherein our Permanent Water is
the whole Secret of our Stone, for by that Water is our Stone
perfected,
for that in it lodges the vivifying humidity of our Stone, as being the
Life and Resurrection of it, of which our Secret Water it is said in
Turba,
"The Water alone does all, for it dissolves all, it congeals all that
is
congealable and divides and rends all without any other aid. It is that
which Tinges and is Tinged". In brief, Our Work is no other thing than
Vapour and Water, which is called whitening and rubifying and casting
off
the Blackness of the Bodies, which Philosophers have called Permanent
Water,
fixed and incorruptible and incombustible Oil, that cannot burn. T&#8217;is
the
matter which Philosophers have divided into two parts, one of which
dissolves
the Bodies by Calcination, that is, by reducing it into calx and by
congealing
itself and the other part of the said Water cleanses the Body from
Blackness,
Whitens and reduces it, makes it fluid and running in multiplying its
parts. </p>
  <p>This Water is called in <i>Turba</i>, "Most sharp Vinegar, and
penetrating
kindly by a vivifying heat, containing an invariable Tincture, which
cannot
be defaced or blotted out". </p>
  <p>This Water is named by Artephius, temperate or the Moisture of the
Wise,
Wine of Choleric Youth. This Water is greatly concealed by the
Philosophers
under divers and various names, and is known but to few people. Hermes
possessed it, and handled it, Alphidius hath treated of it, Morienus
hath
written of it, Lully understood it, Arnold perceived it, Raymond hath
feasibly
declared it, Geber knew it, the Text was not ignorant of it, Rasis,
Avicen,
Galen, Haley, and above all Albertus hath wisely hidden it. Dastin
Bernard
de Greves, Pythagoras, the Ancient Merlin, and Aristotle understood it
well. In short this Water is crowned Victorious Secret, Celestial and
Glorious
Water, the last and final Secret for the nourishment of our Glorious
Stone,
without which it is never amended, increased, nor multiplied, for which
Philosophers have concealed the manner of making it, as the Key of
their
Magistery, and in truth, I have read above one hundred books of this
Art,
and in none of them I found the perfecting of this Mercury and
Permanent
Water and have seen great and learned men in this Science, among whom I
have not found one that had this secret, except one able Physician, who
told me he had been 36 years in earnest prosecution before he obtained
it. </p>
  <p>Of this nature it is said that a double nature is given to it, to
wit,
of Sol and Luna, in the bowels of whom this Argent Vive is multiplied,
as in the proper Belly of its Mother, lodged and purged, and converted
into White Sulphur not burning in the action of the heat of the Fire,
being
therein regularly informed by Art and qualities of Sulphur, having been
before introduced or placed in the said Argent Vive. So that this
Mercurial
Water is nothing else but the Spirit of Bodies converted into the
nature
of Quintessence giving virtue to our Stone and governing it, and the
Stone
of our Composition is the containing Matrix or expedient place, to wit,
Mother Earth, or vessel of Nature, retaining the formative Virtue of
the
Stone, wherein natural heat is placed, which is formative Virtue
issuing
from the Vessel by the Fifth Spirit, wherefore it is called Mother and
Nurse as giving natural Virtue to Sulphur, feeding and nourishing it. </p>
  <p>This is our Composition, wherein this natural Vessel, whereto the
Spirits
are transmuted from nature to nature as they proceed, and so much the
more
as they are transmuted and altered in this Vessel retained so much, the
remoter they are moved from their corruption and imperfection
whatsoever,
and the more they approach to the terms of purity and perfection, so
long
till they obtain the accomplishment of a Quintessence. </p>
  <p>Wherefore they take, or are clothed with a New Nature, which is
clean,
White, pure, cleansed from all corrosiveness, and phlegmatic
volatility. </p>
  <p>In such affinity then of Vessel the humidity of the Spirit wherein
the
abovesaid is enclosed by its viscosity or glutinous nature is retained
in adherence, or firm and natural conjunction and heat, as in its
Radical
Humidity mixt and mortified, and after Death revived by sublimation by
a joyful deliverance in elevating itself wholly from a Saline and
Bitter
Nature. </p>
  <p>Then it is mighty to sustain itself, nourish and multiply itself,
as
being already a kindled Fire and simple nature, which t&#8217;is convenient
to
nourish with Whey, to wit, its enlivening Humidity of which in part it
was engendered, which is Permanent Water, Virgin&#8217;s Milk or Aqua Vitae
coming
from the Vine, for they are wholly different. It is nevertheless called
Aqua Vitae for that it vivifies our Stone to Resurrection, it is also
called
Blod incrudated, White Mentruum, nourishment of the Child, Food of the
heart, Water of the Sea, Food of the Dead, and Argent Vive of
Philosophers
depurated from feculent terrestriety by Philosophical Sublimation.
After
then our Compound is made, it should be placed in its Secret Vessel and
decocted, or baked in a very soft heat moist or dry, and moistened and
congealing soften till the Earth arise Foliated, which must be
afterwards
calcined and infinitely incerated in fixing with the said Water, which
is called fixed incombustible Oil, till it flows and metls soon like
unto
wax, of which saith Raymond, "The manner of creation is, the Stone be
sublimed
with part of the reserved humidity which never leaves its Body, being
mixed,
with circulation gives true fusion", and afterwards he said, "It is
commanded
that thou moisten or refresh our Stone with its permanent Humidity,
whereby
its parts are clarified as appear, for after the perfect clearing or
purgation
of our Stone from all corruption, particularly the Sulphureous humours,
to wit the unctuous combustible fatness and phlegmatic vaporeity, the
Stone
is brought to its proper nature and substance, not burning, and without
this Humidity, our Stone is never amended, nourished, augmented or
multiplied". </p>
  <p>It is to be noted also that our Stone in digestion is moved to all
the
colours in the World, but three are principal, of which good care and
notice
are to be taken, to wit, Black colour, which is first and it is the key
of the Beginning of the Work; of the Second kind or degree, the White
colour
is the Second, and the Red is the third, whereof it is said that the
thing
of which the head is Red, the feet White, and the eyes Black is our
Magistery. </p>
  <p>Note then that when our Compound begins to be moistened with our
Permanent
Water, then is all the Composition turned like melted Pitch and is
Black
like a coal, and at this time is our Compound called Black Pitch, Burnt
Soot, Melted Lead, Foul Laton, Magnesia, and the Black Bird. For there
is seen a Black Cloud flying in the middle region of the vessel in
desirable
manner being elevated about the vessel, and at the bottom, the Matter
melted
like Pitch, of which saith James of the bough of St. Saturnia, a
blessed
Cloud flying about the vessel wherein the Sun is eclipsed, and Raymond
says, "When this mass is thus Black then it is dead and deprived of
Form,
then it is said to be a dead Body, and out of good temperature, its
Soul
being separated from it, then is the humidity manifest in the colour of
Black Quicksilver, and stinking, which before was dry and White, of
good
odour heating, cleansed from Sulphur by its first operation and is now
depurating by this Second Operation." </p>
  <p>And for this is thy Body deprived of Soul which it hath lost with
its
Splendour and marvelous lucidity which at first it had, and all now is
Black and Ugly, wherefore Geber names it from its properties, stinking
Black Spirit, occultly White and manifestly Black, naming it Living
Water
and Dry. </p>
  <p>This Mass thus Blackened is the Key and sign of perfect invention
of
this manner of Work of the Second Regimen of our most precious Stone,
wherefore
saith Hermes: "This Blessing being seen, believe that you are in a good
Path, and have kept in the Right Way". </p>
  <p>So that this Blackness in colour shows the true and right manner
of
working, for hereby the matter is made deformed and corrupt with a true
Natural corruption from whence follows generation and real disposition
in this Matter, to wit, the requirements of a new Form which for lucid
serenity or clearness, beauty, purity, marvelous splendour and fragrant
odour or great sweetness. </p>
  <p>Now when the work of Blackness is accomplished we must come to the
Work
of Whiteness, which is one of the Roses in the Philosopher&#8217; Garden, by
many desired, required and expected, but as above said before Whiteness
appeareth, all the Colours that may be thought of are seen and
perceived
in this work, of which care need not be had, but only to Whiteness that
must be expected with great constancy. The way nevertheless of working
to the Black, to the White, and to the Red is always one, to wit, bake
and decoct the Compound in feeding with our Permanent Water, to wit,
decoct.
Compound with Red, by which imbibitions and digestions is extracted
from
the Stone this middle Substance of Mercury, which is the whole
perfection
of our noble Mastery, in such manner that our Stone should be purged
not
only from sulphureousness but also from earthiness by sublimation of
Water,
Calcination of Earth, moistening and decocting of them by reduction,
between
distillation and calcinations, and after conjoining with proper
Sulphur,
by its measured natural heat decoct, or bake so long until it be
congealed
and deprived of all Sulphureous humidity by the union of natural heat
and
Fire thereto corresponding, and after it is sublimed into Sulphur most
White like Snow. </p>
  <p>By this it appears that our Stone contains two substances of One
Nature,
one volatile, the other Fixt, which, and either of which the
Philosophers
call Argent Vive, because in the operation of this Stone, the Stone
ought
to be separated from all combustible and corrupt Sulphureity, and that
there remains only the pure subtility and middle Substance of Argent
Vive
congealed and depurated of all external Sulphur or strange corruption,
and this depuration is made when the Body is turned into Spirit, and
the
Spirit into Body by reiterated calcinations, reduction, and
sublimation,
whereby is made the dissolution of the Body, and is but One Operation
whereby
all these things are performed, to wit, solution of Argent Vive fixed
with
congelation of certain parts of the Volatile, and Ablution thereof with
Water proportioned (with Fire) and the congelation of the said Water
into
a Stone, by the medium and operation of Heat of the Male and the
Female,
then truly is born the Stone after the first conjunction of them and
not
before, as in Man and Woman by this operation is the Body divided,
subtilized
and diligently governed, till its subtile Soul is extracted from its
solidity
and turned into a thin attenuated and impalpable Spirit. Then the Body
is made no Body, and the no Body is made a Body, and this is true, and
the true invention of the rule of working. </p>
  <p>It is to be known though all Bodies are to be dissolved by a
penetrating
Spirit, with which it is to be mixed and whereby without doubt is made
a like Spiritual, and as this Spirit is sublimed it is named Water,
which
washeth itself and cleanseth as above said, in rising with a most
subtile
Substance, opening the corrupted parts and of it. And this Ascension
Philosophers
have called Distillation, Ablution, and Sublimation perfect and
accomplished.
The Stone is then vivified by the vivifying Spirit or natural Soul of
which
it was deprived in Blackness, and is now inspired, animated,
resuscitated,
reduced, and carried to its last end of subtility and purity, and is a
Stone, Crystalline, White as Snow, rising from the bottom of the vessel
sticking to the sides of it, the remainder of its resting in the bottom
of the vessel below this Crystalline Stone separated from its residence
gathered apart and sublimed without the said residence for if you try
to
sublime it with its residence gathered apart and sublimed without the
said
residence for if you try to sublime it with its residence you shall
never
make separation of them, and so your labour will be lost. </p>
  <p>Sublime it then without its residence, and it is the White
Foliated
Earth of the White Sulphur not burning, congealing, and after perfectly
fixing Mercury, cleansing all foul Bodies and perfecting the imperfect,
reducing them to true Luna. </p>
  <p>This Sulphur so sublimed, no whiteness in the world exceeds it,
for
it is divested of all corruptible things, and is a new nature, a
Quintessence
arising from the pure parts of the four Elements. T'is the Sulphur of
Nature,
Arsenic, not burning, the incomparable treasure, the Joy of
Philosophers,
and the Delight so much desired by them, the White, Clear and Foliate
earth,
the Bird of Hermes, the Daughter of the Great Secret, and the new White
Black Bird whose Feathers exceed Crystalline Brightness, White as Snow,
of clean subtility and agility. </p>
  <p>This Philosophical White Black Bird is of venerable virtue, for it
is
the Substance of the purest Substance in the world which is the simple
Soul of the Stone, clean, noble, separated from all corporeal thickness
and by great subtility divested of all bodily grossness. This White
Incombustible
Sulphur it is convenient to calcine the space of its dry decoction, so
long till it becomes most subtile powder, impalpable, deprived of all
sulphureous
humidity. Then let it be incerated with White Oil of Philosophers by
little
and little till it suddenly flow like wax, and without creation being
finished,
which is nothing but reduction, to fusion or melting the thing would
not
melt. Then is our Glorious White Stone of Philosophers finished,
fusible
and melting, White as Snow, of new verdure, persevering in the Fire,
retaining
and congealing mercury after fixing it, tingeing and transmuting all
imperfect
bodies of Metals into Luna, of which cast one part upon one thousand
parts
of Mercury or other imperfect Metal, it shall change it into better
Silver,
finer, purer and whiter than that of the Mines. The manner of
Projection
and Multiplication of the White and Red Stone are both one, but the
multiplication
may be done in two manners, one by projecting one part upon one hundred
parts more into pure Luna or pure Gold. There are other ways more
profitable
and secret to multiply the Medicine in Projection, wherein I am at
present
silent, but by multiplication the Stone is augmented without end, to
wit,
by Digestion, animation and Imbibition with Mercurial Oil, which Oil is
also named of the nature of Metals, and this multiplication is only
done
by Imbibing and refreshing the Stone with the said Mercurial Oil
Permanent,
by dissolving and congealing so often as one will, for the more the
Stone
is digested the greater is its Perfection, and the more it will
transmute,
for it will be more subtile. And herein is accomplished the White
Celestial
Rose, of good odour, embraced by all the Philosophers. </p>
  <p>When the White Stone is accomplished, you must dissolve one part
of
it, and so calcine it (as some will have it) by long decoction till it
becomes like impalpable Ashes, so soft not to be touched, coloured
Citrine.
Then imbibe it with the Red Oil till it become Rd as Coral, as Raymond
saith in his Codicil in his Chapter on Calcination of the Earth,
"Forget
not to Calcine it in its kindled Fire". </p>
  <p>The Matter of the Earth foreknown of thy Stone, with reiterated
dissolution,
distillation of Water, and calcinations of the Body till the Earth
remain
White, void of all humidity and after a longer and stronger
continuation
of the Fire and imbibition of the Water till it become like a Hyacinth
in powder, impalpable to the touch, the sign of which is manifestly
shown. </p>
  <p>As to its last Calcination it remains deprived of all humidity,
spoken
of in the second principle process in the Second Regimen which is to
take
the Stone Red, of which saith Geber it is not without the addition of a
thing tingeing (or Ferment) it, which Nature well knows, to wit,
without
it be imbibed and tinged with this Celestial Water or Oil, of which
says
the Lily of the Philosophers, "Oh Celestial Nature, how dost thou turn
our Bodies into Spirits, Oh Marvelous puissant who is above all, and
surmounts
all, and is the Vinegar which turns the Sol into true Spirit and Luna
also,
without which neither Black nor White nor Red can ever be produced in
our
work. For without this Nature is joined to our Body, which converts it
into Spirit as Spiritual Fire, tingeing it with venerable Tincture that
can never be blotted out". </p>
  <p>This Water Hermes hath called the Water of Waters, Alphidius,
Water
of the Indian, Babylonian and Egyptian Philosophers. This Water whereby
Bodies are turned into Spirits and their First Nature and Matter of our
Stone, are never amended without it, but add to the White the White
Water,
let then the Red Stone be moistened with the Red Water to that end by
long
decoction or bathing, as by long imbibition, and by continual
moistening,
it be made as Red as Blood, the Hyacinth Scarlet or Ruby, shining as a
Light in a dark place as a kindled Light. </p>
  <p>And lastly, that our Stone be adorned with a Red Diadem, of which
saith
Diomedes, "Honour our King coming from the Fire with his Wife and take
heed of burning them by too great heat, bake and decoct them sweetly
that
to the end they may be made Black, then and afterwards Citrine and
Yellow,
then Red, and last of all Tingeing Venom". For these are to be made by
the division of the said Water, as said Egisue, "I command that you put
not all the Water together but by little and little, and bake gently
till
the work be accomplished". </p>
  <p>And so it will appear that the Stone will remain Red of a true
Illuminated
Redness, clear lively, melting like wad, by the Tincture whereof Vulgar
or Argent Vive and all other imperfect Metals may be presently turned
into
true Sol much better than the Mines produce, wherein is accomplished
our
precious Stone, which is infinite Treasure to the Glory of God who
lives
and Reigns perpetually. </p>
