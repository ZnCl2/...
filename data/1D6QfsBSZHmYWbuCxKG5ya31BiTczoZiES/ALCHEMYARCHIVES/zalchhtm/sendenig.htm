<i>Tractatus
de Lapide Philosophorum</i>. This was first published in 1604, but many
editions appeared during the 17th century.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Once upon a time, when I had been for many years of my life sailing
from the Arctic to the Antarctic Pole, I was cast ashore by the Will of
God, on the coast of a certain great ocean; and though I was well acquainted
with the properties of that sea, I did not know whether there was generated
near those shores that little fish Edieneis, which is so anxiously sought,
even unto this present, by men of high and low degree. But as I watched
the Naiads and Nymphs disporting themselves in the water, being fatigued
with my previous toils, and overwhelmed by the multitude of my thoughts,
I was lulled asleep by the soft murmur of the waves; and as I slept sweetly
and gently, I beheld a marvellous vision. I saw ancient Neptune, with a
trident in his hand, rise, with venerable aspect, from our sea, who after
a friendly salutation, carried me to a most beautiful island. This island
was situated in the southern hemisphere, and contained all that is required
for man's use and delight. It appeared a more pleasant and delightful abode
than Virgil's Elysian fields. The shores thereof were fringed with verdant
myrtles and cypresses. The meadows were studded with a large variety of
beautiful and fragrant flowers. The slopes of the hills were clad with
vines, olives, and cedars. The roads were overhung by the intertwining
branches of laurels and pomegranate trees, which afforded grateful shade
to the wayfarer. The plains were covered with groves of orange and lemon
trees. In short, the island was an epitome of earthly beauty.
<p>Concealed under a rock, Neptune shewed me two minerals of that island,
gold and chalybs (steel). Then I was conducted to an orchard in the middle
of a meadow, which was at no great distance, the same being planted with
a great variety of beautiful trees.
<p>Among these he shewed me seven enriched by particular names; and two
of them towered above the rest. One bore fruit which shone like the sun,
and its leaves resembled gold; the fruit of the other was whiter than lilies,
and its leaves were like fine silver. Neptune called the first the Solar,
and the second the Lunar tree. The only thing which it was difficult to
obtain in the island, was water. The inhabitants had tried to get it from
a spring by means of a conduit, and to elicit it from many things. But
the result was a poisonous water, and the only water that could be drunk
was that condensed out of the rays of the sun and moon. The worst of it
was, that no one could attract more than ten parts of this water. It was
wonderful water, I can tell you; for I saw it with my eyes, and touched
with my hands its dazzling whiteness, which surpassed all the splendour
of the snow. While I stood wrapt in admiration, Neptune vanished from my
sight, and there stood before me a tall man, on whose forehead the name
of Saturn was inscribed. He took a vessel, and scooped up ten parts of
the water, in which he placed fruit from the Solar tree; and the fruit
was consumed like ice in warm water.
<p>So I said unto him: --- "Lord, I behold here a marvellous thing. The
water is small in quantity; nevertheless, the fruit of this tree is consumed
therein by a gentle heat. To what purpose is all this?"
<p>He graciously replied: "My son, it is true that this thing is wonderful.
But this water is the water of life, and has such power to exalt the qualities
of this fruit, that it shall afterwards, without sowing or planting - only
by its fragrance - transmute the six trees which remain into its own nature.
Moreover, this water is as a woman to the fruit: the fruits of this tree
can putrefy nowhere but in this water; and though the fruit by itself be
wonderful and precious - yet when it putrefies in this water, it brings
forth out of this putrefaction a Salamander that endures the fire; its
blood is more precious than all treasures, and has power to render fertile
six trees such as you see here, and to make their fruit sweeter than honey."
<p>Then I said unto him: --- "Lord, how is this thing done?"
<p>He replied: "I have already told thee that the fruits of the Solar tree
are living, and they are sweet; but whereas the fruit while it is cooked
in this water can inform but one part, after its coction has been completed
it can inform a thousand."
<p>I then enquired whether the fruit was boiled in this water over a fierce
fire, and how long?
<p>He answered, "This water has an inward fire, and when this is assisted
by continuous outward warmth, it burns up three parts of its own body with
this body of the fruit, until nothing but an incredibly small part remains,
which, however, possesses the most marvellous virtue. This is cooked by
the wise Master first for seven months, and then for ten. But in the meantime,
on each fiftieth day, a variety of phenomena is witnessed."
<p>Again I besought him whether this fruit was cooked in several waters,
and whether anything was added to it.
<p>He made answer: "There is no water, either in this island or in the
whole country, but only this kind alone that can properly penetrate the
pores of this fruit; and you should know the Solar tree also grew out of
this water, which is collected by magnetic attraction out of the rays of
the Sun and Moon. Hence the fruit and the water exhibit a wonderful sympathy
and correspondence. If any foreign substance were added to the water, its
virtue would only be impaired. Hence nothing should be put into the water
but this fruit. After its decoction the fruit has life and blood, and its
blood causes all barren trees to bring forth the same precious fruit."
<p>I asked whether the water was obtained by any secret process, or whether
it was to be obtained everywhere?
<p>He said, "It is found everywhere, and no one can live without it, but
it is best when extracted by means of our Chalybs (steel), which is found
in the belly of the Ram. If you ask what is its use, I answer that before
the due amount of coction has been performed, it is deadly poison, but
afterwards it is the Great Medicine, and yields 29 grains of blood, each
one of which produces 864 of the fruits of the Solar tree."
<p>I asked whether it could be still further improved.
<p>"The Sages say," he returned, "that it can be increased first to ten,
then to a hundred, then to a thousand, then to ten thousand times its own
quantity, and so on."
<p>I asked whether that water was known by any particular name.
<p>He cried aloud, saying: "Few know it, but all have seen it, and see
and love it; it has many names, but we call it the water of our sea: the
water that does not wet the hands."
<p>"Do they use it for any other purpose?" I enquired; "and is anything
born in it?"
<p>"Every created thing," he replied, "uses it, but invisibly. All things
owe their birth to it, and live in it. Nothing is, properly speaking, in
it, through itself mingles with all things. It can be improved by nothing
but the fruit of the Solar tree, without which it is of no use in this
work."
<p>I was going to ask him to speak more plainly, when he began to cry out
in such a loud voice that I awoke out of my sleep, and Saturn and the hope
of getting my questions answered vanished altogether. Be contented, nevertheless,
with what I have told you, and be sure that it is impossible to speak more
clearly. If you do not understand what I have said, you will never grasp
the writings of other philosophers. After a while, I fell into another
deep sleep, in which I saw Neptune standing over me, congratulating me
on our happy meeting in the Garden of the Hesperides. He held up to me
a mirror, in which I saw the whole of Nature unveiled. After we had exchanged
a few remarks, I thanked him for conducting me to this beautiful garden,
and introducing me to the company of Saturn; and I heartily besought him
to resolve for me the difficulties and doubts which Saturn had left uncleared.
<p>"For instance," I said, "I have read and believe that for every act
of generation a male and a female are required; and yet Saturn spoke of
generation by placing the Solar fruit in the water, or Mercury of the Sages.
What did he mean? As the lord of the sea, I know that you are acquainted
with these things, and I entreat of you to answer me."
<p>He said, "What you say about the act of generation is true; and yet
you know that worms are produced in a different way from quadrupeds, namely
by putrefaction, and the place or earth in which this putrefaction occurs
is feminine. In our substance the Mother is the water of which so much
has been said, and its offspring is produced by putrefaction, after the
manner of worms. Hence the Sages call it the Phoenix and Salamander. Its
generation is a resurrection rather than a birth, and for this reason it
is immortal or indestructible. Now, whatsoever is conceived of two bodies
is subject to the law of death; but the life of this fruit is a separation
from all that is corruptible about it. It is the same with the Phoenix,
which separates of itself from its corruptible body."
<p>I enquired whether the substance was compound in its nature.
<p>"No," he said, "there is only the Solar fruit that is put into the water,
which must be to the fruit in the proportion of ten to one. Believe that
what was here revealed to you in a dream by Saturn, after the manner of
our island, is not a dream, but a bright reality which will stand the test
of broad daylight."
<p>With these words he abruptly left me, without listening to my further
questions; and I awoke and found myself at home in Europe. May God shew
to you, gentle reader, the full interpretation of my dreams! Farewell!
<p>To the Triune God be Praise and Glory!
