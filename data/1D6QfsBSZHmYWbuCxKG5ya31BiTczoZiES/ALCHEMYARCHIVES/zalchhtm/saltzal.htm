I happened one day to be taking a rest from my work. I was not thinking
about chemistry at all. So I began to put my laboratory in order,
picking
up the glass instruments, pots, and other vessels that were lying here
and there. I also repaired some furnaces. Finally, when I had spent the
whole day on these tasks, I was tired, and sat down on one of the
chairs
at the table. Sleep came over me very swiftly. I had scarcely closed my
eyes when someone opened the door. I saw a funny little man. He greeted
me warmly. And said that he was a student of chemistry and wanted me to
teach him. He said that he had come to meet me because he had heard
about
my work. I began a conversation with him and asked him how he liked my
instruments. Then he asked me which operations I used them for. I told
him that I was looking for the stone. He smiled and said that he
thought
I must be using such remarkable instruments to deceive careless people.
He said I would see that I had really been deceiving myself instead. I
have never let embarrassment get in the way of my learning something.
Besides,
I could see that what he said was true, and I was well aware of my
shortcomings.
I asked him whether he had an easier way, and whether I neede more
instruments
of various kinds. He said, "I see that you don&#8217;t consider it a disgrace
to learn something and to admit your ignorance. Many people I have
visited
do feel disgraced. But you want to profit from what I have to say. So I
will show you things that very few people out of many thousands have
ever
seen". When he had said that he started to leave, and I followed him.
He
looked back, saw me following him, and said: "Now I know that you have
a great desire to learn, since you are determined to follow me". Then
he
took my hand and led me out past the city gate. There, put in to shore,
was a small boat called Reason. We got in and set out over the water
with
the help of two oars. Soon we could no longer see the city, which was
called
Ignorance. We had just passed by the towers of a city called Arrogance
when we caught sight of a high mountain, it could be. He told me it was
the Salt Mountain, and that its salt water gave moisture to a kingdom
located
in that region, a kingdom called Earth. The water made it so fertile
that
animals, plants, and metals grew there in a most remarkable way. And if
that mountain were not there, the entire fabulous kingdom would perish
in an instant. But as long as the mountain lasted, the kingdom would be
so abundantly fertile that it would never lack for anything it needed.
To promote this great fertility, gold grew there in such abundance that
there was always work for the miners. When I had heard this, I
answered:
"If this water nurtures all things with its power and consequently
causes
even gold to grow, it should rightly be called the moist radical, or
philosophic
mercury". He said: "I see that you have spoken intelligently. You have
observed that this water of the wise is quicksilver, the same thing
that
makes metals become alive and begin to grow. So that you can learn more
about this matter, we will direct the course of our boat to it". I
obeyed
his words and took up the oars with a sorrowful heart. With words and
labor
I tried to move the boat forward, and in a short time we had made good
progress. Finally, after great effort, I put to shore at the salt
mountain.
Then I anchored the boat called Reason so firmly that the waves could
never
move it from that spot. We began to climb the mountain, which was
dripping
with moisture, and after twenty paces caught sight of some hermitages.
Here members of the Rosicrucian Order were living on the fruit of the
mountain.
The old man listened to what they were saying, and then led me up to
the
mountain. I saw a sumptuous fountain springing out of a statue of
Venus.
Its water was salty. There was a stone basin to receive it, and in the
middle of the basin stood the statue, atop a white swan. The water was
sent down through various small pipes into that stone coffer. Some of
it
overflowed the rims and ran off. Along the fours ides of this fountain
stood four animals --- a green lion, a white unicorn, a basilisk, and a
dragon. On their backs they bore four white marble columns, and these
were
joined at the top by arches in the form of a cross. Mercury was sitting
above the crossing, and on his head a winged Fortune was standing on
one
foot. As for the nature of the water, it stayed salty for a while, and
was shimmering in color, though really transparent, clear, and
crystalline.
Then, because my servant wanted to have something to remember this
moment
forever, I told him to climb to the rim of the fountain and draw up
some
water. But he leaned over too far and fell into the water, and before I
could get hold of him, he vanished under the water. Part of him was
transmuted
into water and part went up into the air like smoke. When the old man
saw
that, he handed me an optical tube so that I could watch where the
vapor
went. I saw it filter down to a certain traveler walking along the
road.
He took it in with the air he was breathing. Then the old man said:
"Behold,
now the water of the fountain is prepared. Its water has been
transmuted
into animal substance. The water from your servant has brought that
about.
Now it is like female seed, ready to receive forms from animal sperm,
if
only they can come together". As I walked around the fountain and
looked
at it closely, I saw a pipe coming down from the mountain, a pipe that
was connected to the fountain and had a stopper that was easy to open.
I asked the old man what it was for, and he told me that the fountain
flowed
away from that place. Moistened the earth, and united to it all kinds
of
animal seed. Then all kinds of birds, worms, and animals grew from the
union. But when the stopper closed, the fountain could not flow out.
After
this explanation, the old man went on to say: "Behold how powerful this
fountain is. It joins itself with animal seed and grows along with it.
Do you see how it frees all animal bodies through its own ardent love,
which is charged with magnetic force? It makes whatever is fixed
similar
to itself; but whatever is volatile, namely, masculine seed, it leaves
free to soar. When the seed comes back, now grown heavy, it fixed it,
so
that the fountain can carry on the solution and coagulation without
pause.
Therefore, if you can purge dissolved water, recombine it with fixed
water,
and then fix it, you will have a much more excellent compound than you
had before. Using this water, you will soon manage to get a deeper
understanding
of all animals. You will then come up with the true philosophic
medicine
derived from all animals". Then I asked the old man the name of this
water.
He said it was called universal doubled mercury, also microcosmic
mercury.
Then he said: "The water of the fountain was once universal at all
three
mountains, but now because of your servant it has become
microcosmic.&nbsp;
So an inscription has been placed over the fountain: Make mercury
through
mercury through mercurial water. The smoke that rose up from the
fountain
your servant fell in is called sublimated mercury. It was bound and
constricted
by means of fixed water, and now by the same means it can be bound over
again". Next I asked him the location of the fountain, and whether
there
was any other like it. The old man replied as follows: "There is no
other
fountain like it among all animal things. Only this one can bind itself
with the volatile, sublimated mercury derived fro all animal things,
and
only this one can put on their form. The place where it is found is
called
Pansoma". Then the old man ordered me to fill a phial with that water.
When I had filled it, I tried hard to glimpse my servant in it, but he
had dissolved in the mysterious, greenish water. Afterward we left the
first fountain and moved on to the second, which was sumptuously
decorated
wit a statue of Venus just like the other one. Its four sections were
connected
by four elm trees forming a cross from above. Alongside were vines with
clusters of grapes on which another Mercury was displayed. As before,
Fortune
stood above it. The properties of this water are the same as the water
of the first fountain before it was changed by my servant. Then I asked
the old man another question about this fountain --- if its water were
sprinkled over the earth, would it cause it to grow? He said it would
not:
"this fountain cannot unite with any sublimated mercury unless it has
been
fermented with the fixed salt water of its kingdom and transmuted".
Then
the old man took a knife and cut off a cluster of grapes and threw it
into
the water, where it vanished at once. A fine vapor rose from it. At
that
moment the old man handed me a phial in which to catch the vapor. When
I had caught it, he poured in a little of the salt water from the
fountain.
In the middle of the phial a volatile vapor, once again fixed, took
form.
A stone also took form, which he called the vegetable stone of the
philosophers.
He said that in this way all the best essences could be extracted from
vegetable things, if they were dissolved in this water and again
coagulated.
When I asked him to open the small pipe leading from the fountain, he
complied
at once. With the pipe open, all the earth around it was moistened with
dew, and in an instant everything sprouted, since that water had been
joined
with all vegetable seeds. Then he looked about for a bit of silver, and
when he had thrown it into the fountain it grew up again in the form of
a tree. Behold", he said, "how this fountain itself becomes vegetable
through
the vegetable fermentation of grapes. So it has also drawn out a metal
into vegetable form". From this I inferred: "Therefore an animal
fountain
will draw out things from the other kingdoms into animal form". But he
replied: "You are asking too much of me; be content with what I have
already
said". And so he closed the pipe and the fountain ceased to flow. I
took
the phial filled with water, which was of two colors, white and green,
and went with the old man to the third fountain. It was magnificently
decorated
with a statue of Venus and four columns. One of the columns was made of
gold, the second of silver, the third of copper, and the fourth of tin.
They came together in an arch at the top, and a sheet of lead was paced
over it. On top of this sat Mercury with Fortune, arranged as before.
When
we drew near this fountain, the old man addressed me in these words:
"Behold,
at the other two fountains you saw marvelous things that you had never
seen before. This fountain contains the explanation of the two previous
ones. Here is the foundation of all hermetic knowledge. You will take
it
in as if it were formal instruction. Therefore, pay close attention to
what will be dealt with here". Then I repeatedly asked him to begin the
instruction right away and to let the fountain flow free, so that I
could
see exactly how the mechanism worked. The old man told me it was
impossible
to do that. It would require an order to make the fountain metallic.
And
it would have to be done by means of salt water that was already
metallic.
This proves the truth of the words written around the fountain: Make
Mercury
through mercury through mercurial water. I asked him how, in that case,
I could obtain metallic mercury. But he said: "Do you see what material
the fountain is made of?". It was made of grey stone with many veins in
it. "Don&#8217;t you see how many fragments the inhabitants of this mountain
have chipped off? Surely they must have done so for a reason". Saying
this,
he gave me a hammer, and I pounded off a piece that weighed the same as
half the water in the fountain. I threw it into the water and it
vanished
there, while the water stayed clear and beautiful. But it lost its
brilliant
gleam. As I noticed this, I saw waves like surf suddenly stirring in
the
fountain. But they gradually diminished, and most of them grew very
slight
until they turned to black ice and the fountain dried up completely.
The
old man saw it and said: "Now the union of universal mercury and
mineral
mercury is complete. Now the transmutation of universal mercury to
mineral
mercury will take place, and the manifestation of mineral mercury by
means
of the universal --- a task that took only three minutes". We let the
operation
rest in that state for half an hour, in order to make sure of it. By
then
the fountain began to flow again and was as white as snow. At that
point
the old man said: "Behold, now I have the doubled mercury in my
possession.
Now I own it --- white lily, powder of adamantine, chief central poison
of the dragon, spirit of arsenic, green lion, incombustible spirit of
the
moon, life and death of all metals, moist radical, universal dissolving
nutriment, true menstruum of the philosophers, which without doing any
damage or harm reduces metal to first matter. This is the true water
for
sprinkling, in which the living seeds of metals inhere, and from which
other metals can be produced. Through this water their potency remains
in solution in this water. In all kinds of aqua fortis and other such
unknown
philosophic waters, they lose and relinquish this potency. In this
exalted
water is the true vitriol of the wise, of which Rupicessa said:
"Vitriol
or salt is the proper seed to generate all metals, including both the
remote
and the proximate seed". I will show you its power as clearly as in a
mirror:
for this water from the fountain radically, silently, and wondrously
dissolves
all metals, white and black, by its own innate power and magnetic
force.
In an instant it liquefies metals by its own internal fire. It opens
their
pores and enters them like feminine seed, attracting the masculine
sperm
to itself as if it were attracting the soul of the metal. It leaves the
lifeless body behind like refuse that cannot endure the fire. Certainly
it is a very marvelous thing that this water strips metals of their
dignity.
It is the dry path of the philosophers, by which metals are reduced to
their first matter. It is considered very swift, but compendious. Since
we want to proceed on the humid path, in which common water is added to
this water to make it liquid, we must first make the metals very
bright.
This operation takes a great deal of time and effort, but it is
beautiful
to look at. This is the principal operation of philosophic mercury
consisting
in the radical solution of metals. They are dissolved away from their
seeds
silently, by a force of burning love. From this principal operation of
the water, all the rest follow, beginning with coagulation and
generation.
This saying of the philosophers applies: "The corruption of one thing
is
the generation of another". Thirdly, it is called philosophic medicine.
These three secondary powers contain countless others within them, all
of which arise from the first radical solution. Up to this point, you
have
perceived the qualities of philosophic mercury as the feminine seed of
metals. What follows is everything about the correct use of the
philosophic
stone". After he had told me this, the old man showed me that I would
need
to take earth, the matrix of gold, and put it in the water. I asked him
where I could get it. He replied that the same substrate that contains
mercury also contains the metallic earth of gold. He gave me a hammer,
and I chipped off the same amount as before. When it fell into the
water,
he asked me to give him enough gold to weigh the same as one
sixty-fourth
of the water. I handed him four Hungarian ducats, which he filed down
and
planted in the earth of the fountain. Then the water, white from the
earth,
gradually begins to change color to red and finally dried up
completely.
The old man continued: "Now the union of gold earth and philosophic
mercury
is complete, and the principium of the stone has been made. Now follow
the radical dissolution of gold, the manifestation of the seed of gold,
and the radical conjunction of the principia". This task was finished
in
half an hour. But the water had taken on a purple color, and when I
realized
that it was bland and tasteless I cried out in terror and asked what
had
become of our Mercury. The old man ordered me to pour in some common
water
and begin the process of extraction. When this was done, the water
changed
color and became salty --- but not corrosive --- rather than tasteless.
The old man ordered me to dry and clarify it, since no more water could
be extracted. When this was done, there was some unstable white gold in
the dregs, and I saw that it had been robbed of its soul. When it dried
at the edge of the fountain, a rainbow appeared in simple form with all
its colors, and from it the golden water of the Cabalists proceeded but
soon vanished once more. While the fountain was drying up and leaving
behind
the red dust shot through with redness as intense and vibrant as that
of
the sun. I took out this dust and put it in a phial. Then I asked the
old
man what I should do with it, and got this answer: "If you extract this
dust with fine, burning water and concentrate it, you will have true
potable
gold and a philosophers&#8217; stone that is not yet altogether fixed and is
useful in the cure of all illnesses. But if you coagulate it for a long
time and fix it in fire, you will possess a permanent, fixed
philosophers&#8217;
stone with which to cure metals. Taken by itself, this dust is called
the
first matter of the stone, because all three principia of generation
are
subtly brought together in it. Here also the seed of gold, meaning its
feminine seed, and earth of gold are joined in correct proportion.
Therefore,
if you can enkindle the natural fire hidden in the seed of gold using
external
fire, and cause it to look for nourishment which it converts into
itself,
you will have something to rejoice about. Only make sure that you have
been properly instructed, since metal seeds draw in the same amount of
saline water as you need for fixation. If you add too much of that
water
to them, they will dissolve before they can be fixed". Then I asked him
what was the name of this, and he said he called it mercury of the
philosophers.
When we had thoroughly looked over the three fountains, we began to
climb
back down the mountain toward level ground. But the old man led me into
a mountain cave where there lay a magnificent statue armed with a
two-edged
sword. I asked him why the statue was there, and got this response:
"There
is on this mountain a spring that belongs to the three fountains. This
statue, indeed Nature herself, guards the spring and keeps the three
fountains
from ever going dry. The spring originated in these fountains.
Nevertheless,
it was connected with them for this purpose also: for the spring water
to fill the fountains, called Pansomata, as it went up the mountain; to
take animal, vegetable, and mineral operations from them, afterward to
pour itself over the seeds. It grew along with the seeds and left its
form
on their dead bodies. Then it became spring water once again, again
went
up from the spring to the fountains, and again took on a new form in
them.
When it went back to the spring, it lost this form. And so it was in
constant
circulation as it went up and down the mountain. In the spring was
first
matter --- formless, omniform, and of single form. But when it settled
in the fountains it became second matter, known as doubled mercury of
the
philosophers". I took a fair portion of this water and kept it. Then I
went back with the old man to the Rosicrucian hermits. They showed me a
small furnace, a pot, and a glass vessel which they used to cook the
three
salts, dissolve things in them, and reconstitute them to make excellent
medicines. The old man spoke to me as follows: "Now you have seen all
of
Nature, all in all. Now you have proved that God has given to every
single
body a masculine seed to preserve it and also a feminine seed. The
feminine
seed takes its origin, preservation, and nourishment from this
plenteous
fountain. You have seen and understood how all things return to their
first
matter --- feminine seed to its spring, and masculine seed to another
body
--- and are then led back after their separation. And you have seen how
they come together again in constant circulation. Behold, you now have
a true compendium for investigating nature. You now have a laboratory
in
which all threes things can operate by themselves, and in which animal,
vegetable, and metal objects can dissolve. Now you can work in such a
way
that you will please Nature and win honor for yourself". </p>
