<br>
<p>The letter of a philosopher concerning the secret of the great work.
Written on the subject of the instructions which Aristeus left to his son
concerning the Philosophic Magistery. The name of the author is in Latin
in this anagram. <i>Dives sicut ardens, S. Paris, 1688.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were I writing this letter to persuade of the truth
of our Philosophy those, who unto themselves imagine it but a vain idea,
&amp; pure Paradox, then should I follow the example of the divers masters
of this art; &amp; I should attempt, basing myself upon the laws, &amp;
in the operations of nature, to convince such spirits of their error in
demonstrating unto them the solidity of the principles of our science,
&amp; should touch but lightly upon such as concerns its practice: but
in that my design be wholly other, &amp; that I write but for yourselves,
wise Disciples of Hermes, &amp; true Children of the Art, my sole aim is
to serve you as guide upon this course so difficult to follow. Indeed our
practice is a pathway in the sand, whereon must we take the Pole Star for
a guide, rather than trust to the vestiges we find imprinted on it. The
confusion of trails left on it by a near innumerable host, are so numerous,
&amp; one finds there such profusion of divers tracks, leading nearly all
unto but some awesome desert, that it is well nigh impossible not to err
from the true way, that alone those sages favoured by Heaven, have happily
been able to extricate, &amp; to recognise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such confusion brings to an abrupt halt the child
of the art, one at the very start, another in midstream of the Philosophic
course, &amp; some few as they approach even to the ending of this arduous
route, &amp; decry the first glimmerings of the felicitous term of their
enterprise; but perceive not, that the little road, left for them to travel,
is the most laborious of all. They know not that those envious of their
joy have hollowed ditches, &amp; precipices in the midst of the path, &amp;
that unless it be they know the secret byways, whereby the wise sidestep
such dangerous pitfalls, they shall miserably lose all advantage gained,
at the very instant of imagining they had overthrown all obstacles.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sincerely avow, that the practice of this our art
is the thing most difficult in all the world, not as regards its operations,
but with regard to the hardships there be, to learn it plainly from the
works of the Philosophers: for if on the one hand it is with reason called,
child's play; it requires upon the other in those who in it by their labour
&amp; study seek the truth, a most profound knowledge of the Principles,
&amp; operations of nature throughout the three realms; but the more especially
in the realm of the minerals &amp; of metals. 'Tis a grand point to discover
the true material, which is the subject of our work; &amp; one must needs
to that end pierce the thousand dark veils, wherewith it is enwrapped;
one needs must distinguish it by its own proper name, among a million extraordinary
names, wherewith the Philosophers have diversely declared it; comprehend
its properties in their entirety, &amp; judge all degrees of perfection,
art might bestow upon it; know the secret fire of the wise which is the
one &amp; sole agent efficient for the opening, subliming, purifying, &amp;
disposing of the material to reduction into water; to which end must one
penetrate also unto the divine source of the heavenly water, which operates
such solution, animation, &amp; purification of the stone; one must needs
by means of a complete solution of the body, whence it springs, be able
to convert our metallic water into an incombustible oil &amp; to this end
know how to effect the conversion of the elements, &amp; separation, &amp;
reunion of the three principles; one must needs learn to make a white Mercury,
&amp; a Mercury that is citrine; one needs must know how is such a Mercury
fixed, &amp; nourished of its own blood, that it might convert into the
fixed sulphur of the Philosopher, that one not be in want of a more ample
explication.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As there are in nature three realms, there are also
in our art three medicines, which are three different workings in the practice,
&amp; which are nonetheless but three different degrees raising our elixir
to its final perfection. These crucial operations constituting the three
workings are by all Philosophers hid beneath the Key of secrecy, that the
sacred mysteries of our divine Philosophy be not disclosed unto the profane;
but to you, who are the children of science, &amp; who are capable of understanding
the language of the Sages, shall the locks be unloosed, &amp; you shall
have the Keys of the precious treasures of nature, &amp; of art, if that
you shall apply your mind entire &amp; wholly to the comprehension of that
which I wish for you here to set forth, in terms so easily intelligible,
the which is of necessity, for the benefit of such as yourselves who are
predestined, to knowledge of these sublime mysteries. I shall place within
your hands six Keys with which to enter unto the sanctuary of Philosophy,
open all its secret cabinets, &amp; come to intelligence of verities most
hidden.
<p>KEY THE FIRST
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first Key is that which lays open the dark prisons,
wherein lies captive sulphur; 'tis that which knows how from the body to
draw forth semen &amp; which by conjunction of the male, with the female,
spirit with body, sulphur with Mercury, forms the Philosophers' Stone.
Hermes has made manifest the operation of this first Key in these words:
<i>De
cavernis metallorum occultus est, qui Lapis est venerabilis, colore splendidus,
mens sublimis, &amp; mare patens</i> [From the occult cavern of the metals
it is, which is the venerable Stone, in colour bright, &amp; lofty minded,
the wide &amp; manifest sea]; this stone shines brilliant, contains within
it a spirit of sublime origin, &amp; is the Sea of the Wise, wherein they
do seek their mysterious fish. The same Philosopher further &amp; more
particularly marks the birth of this admirable stone in the words: <i>Rex
ab igne veniet, ac conjugio gaudabit, &amp; occulta patebunt </i>[The King
from fire shall come, and in union shall rejoice, and the hid make manifest.].
A King he is &amp; crowned in glory, taking birth within the fire, &amp;
who rejoices in union with the wife that to him is given, &amp; it is this
union that lays manifest what heretofore was hid.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howsobeit, before that I pass on to other subjects,
I have a counsel I would give you, the which shall be unto you of no little
profit; &amp; that is to point out that the operation of the three works,
having much that is analogous, &amp; many relations the one to the other,
the Philosophers wilfully speak concerning them in terms, that those who
have not the eyes of a lynx, shall be duped, &amp; lose themselves in this
labyrinth, whence it is right difficult to extricate oneself. Indeed as
one imagines they are treating of one operation, they are often times speaking
of another: take care then lest you be taken in: for it is true, that in
each working the wise Artist must needs dissolve the body with the spirit,
strike off the crow's head, whiten the black &amp; redden the white; yet
is it properly in the first operation, that the wise Artist shall strike
off the head of the black dragon, &amp; of the crow. It is thence that
art, says Hermes, takes its beginning, <i>quod ex corvo nascitur, hujus
artis est principium</i>.[For what springs of the crow, is the principle
of the art.] Consider then that it is by separation of the fumes, black,
foul, &amp; malodorous of a black most swarthy, that our astral stone takes
form, white, &amp; splendidly radiant, the which in its veins contains
the blood of the pelican; it is on this first purification of the stone,
&amp; at this lucent whiteness, that the initial Key of the first work
comes to its close.
<p>KEY THE SECOND
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second Key dissolves the composite or stone,
&amp; initiates the separation of the Elements, in Philosophic manner;
such separation of the Elements is achieved solely in the raising of those
parts that are subtle, &amp; pure, above those that are crass &amp; earthy.
He who is competent to sublime the stone in manner Philosophic, justly
merits the title Philosopher, for he knows the fire of the Wise, the which
is the unique &amp; sole instrument, capable of operating such sublimation.
Never has Philosopher overtly revealed this secret fire, &amp; puissant
agent, which performs all the marvels of the art; he that understands not,
nor has distinguished it in the characters wherewith I painted it forth
in the discourse of Eudoxus &amp; Pyrophilus, should halt here, &amp; pray
unto God that he illumine him: for knowledge of this great secret is rather
a gift of the Heavens, than light acquired by force of reasoning; let him
read nonetheless the writings of the Philosophers, meditate thereon, &amp;
most especially pray; forthere is no difficulty, that shall not be illumined
by work, meditation, &amp; prayer.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that the stone be sublimed, the conversion of
the Elements, &amp; extraction of principles, shall prove impossible; &amp;
this conversion, which makes of the earth water, of water air, &amp; of
air fire, is the sole &amp; one means whereby may be made, &amp; prepared,
our Mercury. Apply yourself therefore that you know this secret fire, the
which does naturally dissolve the stone, &amp; without violence, &amp;
resolves it into water in the great sea of the Wise, by distillation worked
by the rays of the sun &amp; the moon. Thus it is that the stone, which
according to Hermes, is the vine of the Sages, becomes their wine, whence
by the operations of art is produced their rectified aqua vit&aelig;, &amp;
vinegar most sharp. This, the father of our Philosophy, cries out concerning
this mystery. <i>Benedicta aquina forma, qu&aelig; Elementa dissolvis </i>[Blessing
in the form of water, you who dissolve the Elements!]. But by this water
most divine, the Elements of the stone can not be dissolved, &amp; no perfect
dissolution can there be, 'til completion of a proportionate digestion
&amp; putrefaction, whereon concludes the second Key to the first work.
<p>KEY THE THIRD
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third Key comprises a longer suite of operations,
than all the others together; right little have Philosophers spoken of
it, for all that the perfection of our Mercury hangs thereon; the most
reliable even, such as are Artephius, Trevisan, &amp; Flamel, have passed
over the preparations of our Mercury in silence, &amp; there is hardly
a one, who has not supposed, rather than teach, the longest, &amp; most
important operations of our practice. Wishing but to lend my hand upon
this portion of the way, that you must take, &amp; where for want of light,
it is impossible to follow the veritable path, I shall be show myself less
laconic than were the Philosophers, concerning this third Key, or shall
at very least follow in order that which they have said upon the subject,
so confusedly, that short of Heavenly inspiration, or the aid of a faithful
friend, one shall, &amp; this without doubt, remain lost in the Maze, powerless
to find a fortunate issue howsoever. I am certain, that you who are true
children of science, shall derive great satisfaction, from the elucidation
of these hidden mysteries, concerning the separation &amp; purification
of the principles of our Mercury, the which is effected by a perfect dissolution
&amp; glorification of the body from whence it springs, &amp; by the intimate
union of the soul with its body whereunto is the spirit the unique link,
effecting such conjunction; this then is the intention, &amp; essential
gist of all the operations of this key, which finds its term in the generation
of a new substance infinitely more noble, than the first.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When from the stone the wise Artist has made to spring
forth the fountainhead of living waters, has expressed the resin of the
vine of the Wise, &amp; produced their wine, let him mark that within this
homogenous substance, appearing in the form of water, are three &amp; divers
substances, &amp; the three natural principles of all bodies, salt, &amp;
sulphur, &amp; Mercury, the which are the spirit, soul, &amp; body; &amp;
albeit they seem pure &amp; perfectly united, much is required still that
they be more so; for when by distillation we draw off the water, the which
is the soul &amp; spirit, the body remains in the depths of the vessel,
as a dead earth, black, &amp; dregs, the which it is said, should not be
held in despite; for in our subject, there is no thing which is not good.
The Philosopher John Pontanus holds that the superfluities of the stone
convert themselves into a veritable essence, that those who claim to separate
whatsoever from our stone, understand nothing of Philosophy, &amp; that
all that is superfluous, refuse, dregs, &amp; in fine the entire substance
of the composite, perfects itself through the activity of our fire. This
thesis opens up the eyes of those, who to effect an exact purification
of the elements &amp; principles, have convinced themselves they need take
only of the subtle, &amp; may discard the dense; but the children of science
should not overlook that fire, &amp; sulphur are hid within the earth's
core, &amp; that one must needs wash it carefully with its own spirit,
for that the balm, the fixed salt, which is the blood of our stone, be
thus extracted; herein then lies the essential mystery of this operation,
the which shall be accomplished only should you observe an adequate digestion,
&amp; slow distillation. Follow therefore, O children of art, the precept
given you by the candid Hermes, who in this place says, <i>oportet autem
nos cum h&acirc;c aquin&acirc; anim&acirc;, ut formam sulphuream possideamus,
aceto nostro eam miscere, c&ugrave;m enim compositum solvitur, clavis est
restaurationis </i>[Let us take from this water its soul that we might
have from it its sulphurous form, our vinegar which, when mingled with
the composite shall dissolve it, which is the Key to restoration.]. Knowing
that none are more contrary than fire &amp; water; let the wise Artist
nonetheless bring peace between these enemies, who at heart love well each
the other. Cosmopolitus has declared this mean in but a few words: <i>Purgatis
ergo rebus, fac ut ignis &amp; aqua amici fiant; quod in terr&acirc; su&acirc;,
qu&aelig; cum iis ascenderat, facile facient </i>[Purify therefore the
matter, that flaming fire &amp; water be made friends; for in their earth,
that which from them ascends, is easily achieved]. Be attentive therefore
to this point, moisten often the earth with its own water, &amp; you shall
have, that which you seek. Need not the body then be dissolved in water,
&amp; the earth penetrated by its humidity, for that it be rendered disposed
to generation? In the eyes of the Philosophers the spirit is Eve; the body
Adam; let them be conjoined for the propagation of their species. Hermes
says this same in other terms: <i>Aqua namque fortissima est natura, qu&aelig;
transcendit, et fixam in corpore naturam excitat; hoc est l&aelig;tificat</i>.[For
water is powerful a nature, which transcends, and fixed into a body rouses
nature; this is joy.] Indeed these two substances, which are of the same
nature, but of two different sexes, embrace each the other with the selfsame
love, &amp; satisfaction as do man &amp; woman, &amp; together imperceptibly
rise, leaving behind but few f&aelig;ces in the base of the vessel; such
that soul, spirit, &amp; body, after careful purification, finally appear
inseparably united in form nobler, &amp; more perfect, than they had had
theretofore, &amp; as different from the original liquid form, as is the
Alcohol of a wine perfectly refined, &amp; purified of its salt, from the
substance of that wine, whence it is taken; not only is this comparison
most apt, but also it affords to the children of science a precise knowledge
of the operations of this third Key.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our water is a living fountainhead, streaming from
the stone, by a natural miracle of our Philosophy. <i>Omnium prim&ograve;
est aqua, qu&aelig; exit de hoc lapide </i>[ Of all things the first is
water, that streams from this stone.]. 'Twas Hermes declared this great
truth. And recognised furthermore, that 'tis this water is basis of our
art. The Philosophers give it divers names; calling it now wine, now aqua
vit&aelig;, &amp; now again vinegar, or oil, according to its different
degrees of preparation, or the divers effects, of which it is capable.
Hosowever that may be, let me warn you that it is properly the vinegar
of the wise, &amp; that in the distillation of this divine liquor, occurs
the same thing as with that of common vinegar; from this may you draw great
instruction; the water &amp; phlegm rise first; the oily substance, in
which consists the efficacy of our water, last. And it this substance median
between earth, &amp; water, which in the generation of the Philosophic
child, performs the function of the male; Hermes brings this to our attention
right forcibly with the following words so clear;
<i>unguentum mediocre,
quod est ignis, est medium inter fœcem, &amp; aquam</i>.[A mediocre unguent
which is fire, is midway between the f&aelig;ces, &amp; the water] Not
contenting himself with showing these lights unto his disciples, he further
explains to them in his emerald table, how they should in this operation
proceed. <i>Seperabis terram ab igne; subtile ab spisso suavitur, magno
cum ingenio </i>[Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire; and the subtle
from the gross suavely, and with great ingenuity.]. Mark that you smother
not the fires of the earth in the waters of the flood. This separation,
or rather extraction must needs be effected with great judgement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must thus needs to utterly dissolve the body,
for that you might therefrom extract its humidity entire, the which contains
this precious sulphur, this balm of nature, &amp; marvellous unguent, without
which hope not ever to find in the bottom of your flask that blackness
so sought after by the Wise. Reduce the composite entire then unto water,
&amp; make of the volatile &amp; the fixed perfect union; such is the precept
of Senior, &amp; it merits your attention. <i>Supremus fumus, </i>says
he,<i> ad infimum reduci debet, &amp; divina aqua Rex est de cœlo descendens,
Reductor anim&aelig; ad suum corpus est, quod dem&ugrave;m &agrave; morte
vivificat </i>[Draw down the smoke from highest to lowest, and the divine
Royal water King descends from heaven, Reduce the soul into his body, which
at length from death shall be vivified.]. The balm of life is hid in these
despicable f&aelig;ces, &amp; 'tis these you must wash with the heavenly
waters, until that you have removed all blackness, &amp; thence will your
waters become animate of this fiery essence, which effects all marvels
of our art. Better counsel thereunto, than that of great Trismegistus,
can I not give. <i>Oportet ergo vos ab aqua fumum super-existentem, ab
ubguento nigredinem, &amp; &agrave; fœce mortem depellere </i>[It behoves
you thus to draw from the water fumes, from the balsam its blackness, and
to drive off death from the f&aelig;ces.]; &amp; more, the one means to
success in this operation, is by that same Philosopher taught, who immediately
thereupon adds; &amp; <i>hoc dissolutione, quo peracto, maximam habemus
Philosophiam, &amp; omnium secretorum secretum </i>[And this dissolution
having completed, you shall behold, the heights of all Philosophy, and
the secret of secrets.].
<p>But that you deceive not yourselves as regards this term composite;
I shall affirm that the Philosophers have two species of composite. The
first is that of nature; whereof I spoke in the first Key: for 'tis nature
makes it in a fashion incomprehensible to the artist, who does but to it
lend his hand, in the administration of things external, by which means
does she bear forth, &amp; produce that admirable composite. The second
is the composite of the art; &amp; 'tis the artist does effect the intimate
union of the fixed unto the volatile perfectly conjoined, with all prudence
he might have acquired from a profound Philosophy; the composite of art
is not exactly alike in the second, &amp; third workings, but 'tis nonetheless
ever the artist makes it. Geber defines it a mixture of quicksilver &amp;
sulphur, that is of the volatile &amp; the fixed, reacting the one upon
the other, respectively volatalising, &amp; fixing, the one the other till
the state of perfect fixity be achieved. Consider the example of nature,
&amp; you shall see that the earth produces no fruit, but that it is penetrated
by its humidity, &amp; that the humidity continues sterile; but that it
be held, &amp; fixed by the dryness of the earth.
<br>Be assured therefore, that there shall be no goodly success in this
our art, but that in the first working, you do purge the serpent born of
the alluvium of the earth, bleach these f&aelig;ces feculent &amp; swart,
that therefrom you separate the white sulphur, the sal armoniac of the
wise, which is their chaste Diana who in the basin shall lave herself.
All this mystery is but of the extraction of the fixed salt from our composite
in which consists the energy entire of our Mercury. The water, which rises
by distillation, carries up with it a portion of this fiery salt; such
that the affusion of the water upon the body several times over reiterated,
impregnates, fertilises, &amp; fecundates our Mercury, &amp; renders it
proper to fixation.; the which is the term of the second working: Finer
exposition of which truth can I not find, but in these words of Hermes:
<i>Cum
viderem quod aqua sensim crassior, duriorque fieri inciperet, gaudebam;
certo enim sciebam, ut invenirem quod qu&aelig;rebam</i>.[When I saw that
I had made that water, to commence gradually to thicken, &amp; harden,
I rejoiced; for I knew of a certainty, I should find that, whereafter I
did seek.].
<p>Do you have but right mediocre knowledge of our art, what I have here
said shall more than suffice, for that you understand that all operations
of this Key, ending the first working, are but to digest, distil, cohobate,
dissolve, separate, &amp; conjoin, &amp; this with gentleness, &amp; patience:
in this manner shall you have not only a complete extractio of the juice
of the vine of the wise; but you shall furthermore possess their veritable
aqua vit&aelig;; &amp; I place you on guard that the more you shall rectify,
&amp; the more labour thereon, the more shall it acquire penetration &amp;
virtue; the Philosophers named it aqua vit&aelig; in that it restores life
to metals; but it is more properly called the great moon, by cause of her
splendour, with the which does she shine; &amp; they call it also the substance
sulphuric, the balsam, gum, viscous humidity, &amp; the vinegar most sharp
of the Wise, etc.
<p>Nor is it without reason that the Wise do give to this Mercurial liquor
the name of pontic waters, &amp; of vinegar most sharp; its exuberant ponticity
being the veritable character of its virtue; and, as I have said, furthermore,
that there occurs during its distillation, the same as occurs with vinegar,
in that the phlegm &amp; water rise the first, the sulphurous &amp; salty
parts rising last; separate the phlegm from the waters, unite the water
&amp; fire, the Mercury &amp; sulphur, &amp; you shall at last perceive
the black most swart, blanch the crow, &amp; redden the swan.
<p>Since it is to you only that I speak; true Disciples of Hermes, I shall
reveal to you a secret, that never you will find in its entirety in the
books of the Philosophers. Some are content to say, that of their liquor
are made two Mercuries, the one white, &amp; the other red. Flamel more
particularly says, that one is to utilise a citrine Mercury, in the imbibitions
of the red; &amp; warns the children of the art not to be mistaken upon
this point; assuring also that he had been mistaken himself, were it not
for the warning of Abraham the Jew. Other Philosophers teach, that the
white Mercury is the bath of the moon, &amp; the red the bath of the sun:
but none sought clearly to set forth unto the children of science, by what
path might these two Mercuries be obtained: if you have well understood
me, already you are illumined upon this point. The lunar is the white Mercury,
the vinegar most sharp the red; but to better determine these two Mercuries,
feed them upon a flesh of their own species, the blood of the slaughtered
innocents, which is to say, the spirits of the bodies, are the bath, wherein
the sun &amp; the moon shall bathe.
<p>I have here set forth a great mystery if well you will reflect upon
it: those Philosophers who of it do speak, pass lightly o'er this important
point: the Cosmopolite spoke of it right spiritually by means of an ingenious
allegory, declaring the purification &amp; animation of Mercury: <i>Hoc
fiet, he says, si seni nostro aurum et argentum deglutire dabis, ut ipse
consumat illa, et tandem ille, etiam moriturus comburatur</i>.[This will
be made, if our ancient be set to drown in silver &amp; gold, that he himself
consume, and at length also die.] He concludes &amp; describes the magistry
entire in the words: <i>Cineres ejus spargantur in aquam, coquito eam donec
satis est, &amp; habes medicinam curandi lepram</i>.[His ashes strew upon
the waters, and when they are enough cooked you shall have the medicine
that cures leprosy.] Nor should you ignore the fact, that our ancient is
our Mercury; that this name well suits him, in that he is the first matter
of all metals; the same Author says, that he is their water, to which he
gives the name of steel, &amp; of lode-stone, &amp; he adds thereto for
greater confirmation of that which I have disclosed to you: <i>Si undicies
coit aurum cum eo, emittit suum semen, &amp; debilitatur fer&egrave; ad
mortem usque; concipit chalybs, &amp; generat filium patre clariorem</i>.[If
eleven times he unites with that gold, letting fall his seed, and weakened
continuously almost unto death; he takes unto himself steel, and conceives
a son more renowned than the father.] Whereon therefore a great mystery,
have I disclosed to you without enigma; this is the secret of the Mercuries
twain, the which contain the twin tinctures. Conserve them separately &amp;
confound not their species, for fear that they engender a monstrous progeny.
<p>Not only is it that I dilate more intelligibly than any Philosopher
before me has done, but also I lay bare all that is most essential in the
practice of our art: if you meditate thereon, if you apply yourselves to
understanding it well; but, most especially, if you labour on the lights
that I have given you, I doubt not but that you shall find that which you
seek; &amp; should you not come to such knowledge, by the way I have marked
out unto you, certain am I that with great pains only shall you come at
your goal, by simple reading of the Philosophers. Do not then despair;
but seek out the source of the liquor of the wise, the which contains all
that is necessary to the operation; it is hid beneath the stone; strike
upon it with the rod of magic fire, &amp; a clear fountain shall thence
burst forth; do then as I have shown; prepare the bath of the King with
the blood of the Innocents, &amp; you shall have the animate Mercury of
the wise, which loses never its virtues, if you but preserve it in a vessel
well stopped. There is such sympathy, says Hermes, betwixt purified bodies,
&amp; spirits, that they quit each the other never, once that they be joined
together; for that such union is like unto to that of the soul with the
glorified body, concerning which faith tells us there shall be no further
separation, nor death. <i>Quia spiritus, ablutis corporibus desiderant
inesse, habitis autem ipsis, eos vivificant, &amp; in iis habitant</i>.[For
it cannot be, that the spirit, longs for &amp; misses the purified corporeal
form, but taking it to itself, does animate &amp; inhabit it.] By which
you may see the merit of this precious liquor, unto which have the Philosophers
given more than a thousand divers names, it is the aqua vit&aelig; of the
wise, the water of Diana, the great moon, water of quick silver; it is
our Mercury, our incombustible oil, which when cold like unto ice congeals,
&amp; in the heat, liquefies like unto butter; Hermes calls it the foliated
earth, or earth of leaves; not without great reason; for if you observe
it well, you shall see that it is leaved through &amp; through; in a word
'tis the fountain most clear, whereof the Count of Treves makes mention;
in fine it is the great Alkahest, which radically dissolves all metals;
it is the true &amp; permanent water, which having dissolved them, unites
with them inseparably, augmenting both their weight &amp; tincture. Hermes
assures us our Mercurial water shall, once that it has been changed into
earth, have acquired all virtue, wherewith Philosophers endow it.
<p>KEY THE FOURTH
<p>The fourth key of the art, is the entrance unto the second working;
it is that which reduces our water unto earth; there is in this world but
this one, unique water, which might by simple cooking be converted into
earth; for the Mercury of the wise holds within its core its own proper
sulphur, the which does coagulate it. The terrification of spirit is the
sole operation of this working; cook therefore with patience; if you know
well how to proceed, you shall not be long in awaiting the signs of this
coagulation, &amp; if they appear not in due time, then shall they not
arise at all; for that is a sign indubitable that you have failed in some
essential thing, in the first operation; for to corporify the spirit, which
is our Mercury, it must needs be that you have well dissolved the body,
wherein is enclosed the sulphur, which brings about coagulation of the
Mercury. <i>Vis ejus integre est, si in terram conversa fuerit.</i>[Its
strength be rendered whole, if it be transformed into earth.] Earth admirable
in its fecundity; promised land of the wise, who knowing how to make fall
thereon the heavenly dews, cause it to bring forth fruit of inestimable
price. The Cosmopolite well expresses the benefits of this blessed earth.
<i>Qui
scit in aquam congelare calido, &amp; spirtum cum e&acirc; jungere, cert&egrave;
rem inveniet millesies pretiosiorum auro, &amp; omni re</i>.[Who knows
to heat coagulated water, and with it to join its spirit, shall surely
have found a thing one thousand times more precious than gold, or any other
thing.] Nothing approaches the merit of this earth, &amp; this spirit perfectly
conjoined, in accord with the rules of our art; these are the true Mercury,
&amp; true sulphur of the Philosophers, the living male, &amp; female who
contain in them the seed, which alone may procreate a son more illustrious
yet than his parents. Cultivate therefore &amp; with care this precious
earth; water it often of its own humidity, &amp; dry it out as many times,
&amp; you shall increase no less its qualities, than its weight, &amp;
its fecundity.
<p>KEY THE FIFTH
<p>The fifth key of our work is the fermentation of the stone with the
perfect body, to make thereof the medicine of the third order. Concerning
the operation of the third working I shall say nothing in particular; but
only, that the perfect body is a necessary leaven to our dough: that it
is the spirit effects the union of the leaven with the dough, just as does
water soak the flour &amp; dissolve the yeast, in the creation of a fermented
dough, appropriate to the making of bread. This comparison is right apt,
&amp; 'twas Hermes first made it. <i>Sicut enim pasta sine fermento fermentari
non potest; sic c&ugrave;m corpus sublimaveris, mundaveris, &amp; turpitudinem
&agrave; fœce separaveris; c&ugrave;m conjungere volueris, pone in eis
fermentum, &amp; aquam terram confice, ut pasta fiat fermentum.</i>[Just
as it is impossible to make dough without yeast; so to the sublimed body,
freed of its earthiness &amp; turpitude; et him who wishes to join them,
place therein the appropriate yeast,
<br>And to it add the water &amp; earth, that the dough ferment.] Concerning
fermentation, the Philosopher here reiterates the working in its totality,
showing that just as the Mass of dough, becomes in its entirety leaven,
by the action of the ferment, which to it is added; so too the sum of the
Philosophic confection becomes by this operation a leaven proper to the
fermentation of a new substance, &amp; to the multiplication of it unto
infinity.
<p>If now you well observe how bread is made, you shall find the just proportions,
which to observe, between the substances composing your Philosophic dough.
Do not then bakers utilise greater quantity of flour, than of leaven, &amp;
more yet of water than of flour, &amp; of leaven? The laws of nature are
those to be followed in the practice of this our Magistry. I have given
you all necessary instruction upon the principal points; such that it would
be superfluous to say more, particularly touching upon the final operations,
concerning the which the Philosophers have shown themselves much less reserved,
than as to the earlier, which are the fundaments of their art.
<p>KEY THE SIXTH
<p>The sixth key teaches of the multiplication of the stone, for the reiteration
of the same operation, the which does consist but in opening &amp; shutting;
dissolving &amp; coagulating; humectation &amp; dessication; whereby are
the virtues of the stone augmented unto infinity. Since it has not been
my intention to describe the practice of the three medicines in their entirety,
but to instruct you simply as to those operations which are most important,
as regards the preparation of Mercury, o'er which the Philosophers pass
generally in silence, to hide from the profane mysteries, which are but
for the wise; I shall tarry no longer upon this point, &amp; say naught
further either concerning that which pertains to the projection of the
medicine, in that the success you seek depends not on that; I have given
extensive instruction only upon the third Key, for that it consists in
a long series of operations, the which, albeit simple &amp; natural, require
nonetheless a great intelligence of natural law, &amp; of the qualities
of our materia, as also a perfect knowledge of chymistry, &amp; of the
divers degrees of heat, adapted to such operations.
<p>I have led you by the direct path, &amp; without detour; &amp; if you
have marked well the route I have traced to you, certain am I that you
shall directly come to the goal, without erring. Know me right willing
in my intention, that I have spared you a thousand labours, &amp; as many
pains, that I myself should have suffered on this arduous journey, were
it not for like aid similar unto that I have given you also in this letter,
stemming from a heart sincere, &amp; a tender affection for all veritable
children of science. I should be most grieved for you should you, like
myself, &amp; knowing already the true materia, pass fifteen years entire
upon the work, study, &amp; meditation, &amp; come not to extract from
the stone, its precious sap, the which it encloses in its breast, for cause
that you know not the secret fire of the wise, which causes to stream forth
from this plant to the sight both parched &amp; arid, a water which wets
not the hands, &amp; which by magical union with the dry waters of the
ocean of the wise, resolves into a viscous water, a mercurial liquor, which
is the principle &amp; fundament, &amp; key to our art: transform, separate,
&amp; purify the elements, as I have shown you, &amp; you shall have the
true Mercury of the Philosophers, the which shall furnish you the fixed
sulphur, &amp; medicine universal.
<p>But I place you on guard, that albeit you have knowledge of this secret
fire of the wise, yet have you not come entire to the end of the first
course. I myself erred several years in the route yet to be traversed,
to arrive at the mysterious fountain, wherein the King does bathe, rejuvenate
himself, &amp; resume a life new &amp; exempt from all infirmity; you must
needs know also to purify, heat, &amp; animate that Royal bath: it was
to lend aid in this secret path, I drew out what I had to say upon the
third Key, wherein are all its operations to be deduced. Of my heart I
hope, that the instructions I have given you, lead you direct to the goal.
But bear in well mind O children of science, that knowledge of our Magistry
stems more from the inspiration of Heaven, than from illuminations one
might garner of one's own accord. This truth is borne out by all Philosophers:
wherefore is it not enough to labour; but pray assiduously; read veridical
&amp; authentic texts; &amp; meditate day &amp; night, upon the operations
of nature, &amp; upon what conceivably she might do, were she aided by
the attentions of our art, &amp; in this way shall you of a certainty succeed
in your undertaking.
<p>And this is all I have to say, in this my letter; I had no wish to hold
forth at length, such as the subject might demand; nor have I spoken of
aught but what is essential to our art; such that if you know our stone,
which is the sole &amp; unique material of our stone, &amp; if you have
the intelligence of our fire, which is at once both secret &amp; natural,
than do you hold the keys of the art, &amp; you may calcinate our stone,
not by a vulgar calcination, the which is achieved by the violence of the
fire; but by the calcination Philosophic, the which is natural through
&amp; through.
<p>Mark also this with the most illumined of the Philosophers, that there
is this difference, between vulgar calcination, effected by the force of
fire, &amp; natural calcination; that the first destroys the body, &amp;
consumes the greater part of its radical humidity; but that the second
not only conserves the humidity of the body, it calcinates; but also considerably
augments it.
<p>Experience will teach you in practice this great truth; for you shall
find indeed, that this Philosophic calcination, which sublimes, &amp; distils
the stone as it calcinates, greatly augments its humidity: the reason for
this is, that the fiery spirit of the natural fire incarnates in the substances
which are to it analogous. Our stone is an astral fire, which harmonises
with the natural fire, &amp; which like unto a veritable salamander takes
birth, nourishment, &amp; growth from the fire Elementary, to which it
is geometrically proportionate.
