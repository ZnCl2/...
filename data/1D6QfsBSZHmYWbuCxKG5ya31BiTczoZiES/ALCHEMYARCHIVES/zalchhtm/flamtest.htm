and sold only by the Editor. 1806. In French and English on facing pages.
<p>"This text is probably a late invention but it is nevertheless interesting
for that. I cannot locate a manuscript of the 'Testament', though it was
mentioned in Borel's bibliography of alchemy. It was probably written in
France in the late 18th century, during the revival of interest in Flamel.
It protests too much its authenticity, and gives an unlikely story about
how it survived from Flamel's time. Perhaps if the editor (or writer) had
just not mentioned anything about its origins they might have better persuaded
us about its authenticity. In spite of this it is a clear statement of
the alchemical process." --- Adam McLean

<p><b>1.</b> I Nicholas Flamel, a scrivener of Paris, in the year 1414,
in the reign of our gracious Prince Charles the VIth, whom God preserve;
and after the death of my faithful partner Perenelle, am seized with a
desire and a delight, in remembrance of her, and in your behalf, dear nephew,
to write out the whole magistery of the secret of the Powder of Projection,
or the Philosophical Tincture, which God hath willed to impart to his very
insignificant servant, and which I have found out, as thou also wilt find
out in working as I shall declare unto you.
<p><b>2.</b> And for this cause do not forget to pray to God to bestow
on thee the understanding of the reason of the truth of nature, which thou
wilt see in this book, wherein I have written the secrets word for word,
sheet by sheet, and also as I have done and wrought with thy dear aunt
Perenelle, whom I very much regret.
<p><b>3.</b> Take heed before thou workest, to seek the right way as a
man of understanding. The reason of nature is Mercury, Sun and Moon, as
I have said in my book, in which are those figures which thou seest under
the arches of the Innocents at Paris. But I erred greatly upwards of 23
years and a half, in labouring without being able to marry the Moon, that
is quicksilver, to the Sun, and to extract from them the seminal dung,
which is a deadly poison; for I was then ignorant of the agent or medium,
in order to fortify the Mercury: for without this agent, Mercury is as
common water.
<p><b>4.</b> Know in what manner Mercury is to be fortified by a metallic
agent, without which it never can penetrate into the belly of the Sun and
of the Moon; afterward it must be hardened, which cannot be affected without
the sulphureous spirit of gold or silver. You must therefore first open
them with a metallic agent, that is to say with royal Saturnia, and afterward
you must actuate the Mercury by a philosophic means, that you may afterward
by this Mercury dissolve into a liquor gold and Luna, and draw from their
putrefaction the generative dung.
<p><b>5.</b> And know thou, that there is no other way nor means to work
in this art, than that which I give thee word for word; an operation, unless
it be taught as I now do, not at all easy to perform, but which on the
contrary is very difficult to find out.
<p><b>6.</b> Believe stedfastly, that the whole philosophic industry consists
in the preparation of the Mercury of the wise, for in it is the whole of
what we are seeking for, and which has always been sought for by all ancient
wise men; and that we, no more than they, have done nothing without this
Mercury, prepared with Sun or Moon: for without these three, there is nothing
in the whole world capable of accomplishing the said philosophical and
medicinal tincture. It is expedient then that we learn to extract from
them the living and spiritual seed.
<p><b>7.</b> Aim therefore at nothing but Sun, Moon and Mercury prepared
by a philosophical industry, which wets not the hands, but the metal, and
which has in itself a metallic sulphureous soul, namely, the ignited light
of sulphur. And in order that you may not stray from the right path, apply
yourself to metals; for there the aforesaid sulphur is found in all; but
thou wilt easily find it, even almost similar to gold, in the cavern and
depths of Mars, which is iron, and of Venus, which is copper, nearly as
much in the one as in the other; and even if you pay attention to it, this
sulphur has the power of tinging moist and cold Luna, which is fine silver,
into pure yellow and good Sun; but this ought to be done by a spiritual
medium, viz. the key which opens all metals, which I am going to make known
to you. Learn therefore, that among the minerals there is one which is
a thief, and eats up all except Sun and Moon, who render the thief very
good; for when he has them in his belly, he is good to prepare the quicksilver,
as I shall presently make known to you.
<p><b>8.</b> Therefore do not stray out of the right road, but trust to
my words, and then give thyself up to the practice, which I am going to
bestow on thee in the name of the Father, of Son, and Holy Ghost.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Practice</font></b></center>

<p><b>9.</b> Take thou in the first place the eldest or first-born child
of Saturn, not the vulgar, 9 parts; of the sabre chalibs of the God of
War, 4 parts. Put this latter into a crucible, and when it comes to a melting
redness, cast therein the 9 parts of Saturn, and immediately this will
redden the other. Cleanse thou carefully the filth that arises on the surface
of the saturnia, with saltpetre and tartar, four or five times. The operation
will be rightly done when thou seest upon the matter an astral sign like
a star.
<p><b>10.</b> Then is made the key and the sabre, which opens and cuts
through all metals, but chiefly Sun, Moon and Venus, which it eats, devours
and keeps in his belly, and by this means thou art in the right road of
truth, if thou has operated properly. For this Saturnia is the royal triumphant
herb, for it is a little imperfect king, whom we raise up by a philosophic
artifice to the degree of the greatest glory and honour. It is also the
queen, that is to say the Moon and the wife of the Sun: it is therefore
both male and female, and our hermaphrodite Mercury. This Mercury or Saturnia
is represented in the seven first pages of the book of Abraham the Jew,
by two serpent encircling a golden rod. Take care to prepare a sufficient
quantity of it, for much is required, that is to say about 12 or 13 lbs.
of it, or even more, according as you wish to work on a large or a small
scale.
<p><b>11.</b> Marry thou therefore the young god Mercury, that is to say
quicksilver with this which is the philosophic Mercury, that you may acuate
by him and fortify the said running quicksilver, seven or even ten or eleven
times with the said agent, which is called the key, or a steel sharpened
sabre, for it cuts, scythes and penetrates all the bodies of the metals.
Then wilt thou have the double and treble water represented by the rose
tree in the book of Abraham the Jew, which issues out of the foot of an
oak, namely our Saturnia, which is the royal key, and goes to precipitate
itself into the abyss, as says the same author, that is to say, into the
receiver, adapted to the neck of the retort, where the double Mercury throws
itself by means of a suitable fire.
<p><b>12.</b> But here are found thorns and insuperable difficulties, unless
God reveals this secret, or a master bestows it. For Mercury does not marry
with royal Saturnia: it is experient to find a secret means to unite them:
for unless thou knowest the artifice by which this union and peace are
effected between these aforesaid argent-vives, you will do nothing to any
purpose. I would not conceal any thing from thee, my dear nephew; I tell
thee, therefore, that without Sun or Moon this work will profit thee nothing.
Thou must therefore cause this old man, or voracious wolf, to devour gold
or silver in the weight and measure as I am now about to inform thee. Listen
therefore to my words, that thou mayest not err, as I have done in this
work. I say, therefore, that you must give gold to our old dragon to eat.
Remark how well you ought to operate. For if you give but little gold to
the melted Saturnia, the gold is indeed opened, but the quicksilver will
not take; and here is an incongruity, which is not at all profitable. I
have a long while and greatly laboured in this affliction, before I found
out the means to succeed in it. If therefore you give him much gold to
devour, the gold will not indeed be so much opened nor disposed, but then
it will take the quicksilver, and they will both marry. Thus the means
is discovered. Conceal this secret, for it is the whole, and neither trust
it to paper, or to any thing else which may be seen. For we should become
the cause of great mischief. I give it thee under the seal of secrecy and
of thy conscience, for the love I bear thee.
<p><b>13.</b> Take thou ten ounces of the red Sun, that is to so say, very
fine, clean and purified nine or ten times by means of the voracious wolf
alone: two ounces of the royal Saturnia; melt this in a crucible, and when
it is melted, cast into it the ten ounces of fine gold; melt these two
together, and stir them with a lighted charcoal. Then will thy gold be
a little opened. Pour it on a marble slab or into an iron mortar, reduce
it to a powder, and grind it well with three pounds of quicksilver. Make
them to curd like cheese, in the grinding and working them to and fro:
wash this amalgama with pure common water until it comes out clear, and
that the whole mass appears clear and white like fine Luna. The conjunction
of the gold with the royal golden Saturnia is effected, when the mass is
soft to the touch like butter.
<p><b>14.</b> Take this mass, which thou wilt gently dry with linen or
fine cloth, with great care: this is our lead, and our mass of Sun and
Moon, not the vulgar, but the philosophical. Put it into a good retort
of crucible earth, but much better of steel. Place the retort in a furnace,
and adapt a receiver to it: give fire by degrees. Two hours after encrease
your fire so that the Mercury may pass into the receiver: this Mercury
is the water of the blowing rose-tree; it is also the blood of the innocents
slain in the book of Abraham the Jew. You may now suppose that this Mercury
has eat up a little of the body of the king, and that it will have much
more strength to dissolve the other part of it hereafter, which will be
more covered by the body of the Saturnia. Thou has now ascended one degree
or step of the ladder of the art.
<p><b>15.</b> Take the faeces out of the retort; melt them in a crucible
in a strong fire: cast into it four ounces of the Saturnia, (and) nine
ounces of the Sun. Then the Sun is expanded in the said faeces, and much
more opened that at the first time, as the Mercury has more vigour than
before, it will have the strength and virtue of penetrating the gold, and
of eating more of it, and of filling his belly with it by degrees. Operate
therefore as at first; marry the aforesaid Mercury, stronger one degree
with this new mass in grinding the whole together; they will take like
butter and cheese; wash and grind them several times, until all the blackness
is got out: dry it as aforesaid; put the whole into the retort, and operate
as thou didst before, by giving during two hours, a weak fire, and then
strong, sufficient to drive out, and cause the Mercury to fall into the
receiver; then wilt thou have the Mercury still more acuated, and thou
wilt have ascended to the second degree of the philosophic ladder.
<p><b>16.</b> Repeat the same work, by casting in the Saturnia in due weight,
that is to say, by degrees, and operating as before, till thou hast reached
the 10th step of the philosophic ladder; then take thy rest. For the aforesaid
Mercury is ignited, acuated, wholly engrossed and full of the male sulphur,
and fortified with the astral juice which was in the deep bowels of the
gold and of our saturnine dragon. Be assured that I am now writing for
thee things which by no philosopher was ever declared or written. For this
Mercury is the wonderful caduceus, of which the sages have so much spoken
in their books, and which they attest has the power of itself of accomplishing
the philosophic work, and they say the truth, as I have done it myself
by it alone, and thou wilt be enabled to do it thyself, if thou art so
disposed: for it is this and none else which is the proximate matter and
the root of all the metals.
<p><b>17.</b> Now is done and accomplished the preparation of the Mercury,
rendered cuting and proper to dissolve into its nature gold and silver,
to work out naturally and simply the Philosophic Tincture, or the powder
transmuting all metals into gold and silver.
<p><b>18.</b> Some believe they have the whole magistery, when they have
the heavenly Mercury prepared; but they are grossly deceived. It is for
this cause they find thorns before they pluck the rose, for want of understanding.
It is true indeed, that were they to understand the weight, the regimen
of the fire, and the suitable way, they would not have much to do, and
could not fail even if they would. But in this art there is a way to work.
Learn therefore and observe well how to operate, in the manner I am about
to relate to you.
<p><b>19.</b> In the name of God, thou shalt take of thy animated Mercury
what quantity thou pleasest; thou wilt put it into a glass vessel by itself;
or two or four parts of the Mercury with two parts of the golden Saturnia;
that is to say, one of the Sun and two of the Saturnia; the whole finely
conjoined like butter, washed, cleansed and dried; and thou wilt lute thy
vessel with the lute of wisdom. Place it in a furnace on warm ashes at
the degree of the heat of an hen sitting on her eggs. Leave this said Mercury
so prepared to ascend and descend for the space of 40 or 50 days, until
thou seest forming in thy vessel a white or red sulphur, called philosophic
sublimate, which issues out of the reins of the said Mercury. Thou wilt
collect this sulphur with a feather: it is the living Sun and the living
Moon, which Mercury begets out of itself.
<p><b>20.</b> Take this white or red sulphur, triturate it in a glass or
marble mortar, and pour on it, in sprinking it, a third part of its weight
of the Mercury from which this sulphur has been drawn. With these two make
a paste like butter: put again this mixture into an oval glass; place it
in a furnace on a suitable fire of ashes, mild, and disposed with a philosophic
industry. Concoct until the said Mercury is changed into sulphur, and during
this coction, thou wilt see wonderful things in thy vessel, that is to
say, all the colours which exist in the world, which thou canst not behold
without lifting up thy heart to God in gratitude for so great a gift.
<p><b>21.</b> When thou has attained to the purple red, thou must gather
it: for then the alchymical powder is made, transmuting every metal into
fine pure and neat gold, which thou maist multiply by watering it as thou
hast already done, grinding it with fresh Mercury, concocting it in the
same vessel, furnace and fire, and the time will be much shorter, and its
virtue ten times stronger.
<p><b>22.</b> This then is the whole magistery done with Mercury alone,
which some do not believe to be true, because they are weak and stupid,
and not at all able to comprehend this work.
<p><b>23.</b> Shouldest thou desire to operate in another way, take of
fine Sun in fine powder or in very thin leaves: make a paste of it with
7 parts of thy philosophic Mercury, which is our Luna: put them both into
an oval glass vessel well luted; place it in a furnace; give a very strong
fire, that is to say, such as will keep lead in fusion; for then thou has
found out the true regimen of the fire; and let thy Mercury, which is the
philosophical wind, ascend and descend on the body of the gold, which it
eats up by degrees, and carries in its belly. Concoct it until the gold
amd Mercury do no more ascend and descend, but both remain quiet, and then
will peace and union be effected between the two dragons, which are fire
and water both together.
<p><b>24.</b> Then wilt thou see in thy vessel a great blackness like that
of melted pitch, which is the sign of the death and putrefaction of the
gold, and the key of the whole magistery. Cause it therefore to resuscitate
by concocting it, and be not weary with concocting it: during this period
divers changes will take place; that is to say, the matter will pass through
all the colours, the black, the ash colour, the blue, the green, the white,
the orange, and finally the red as red as blood or the crimson poppy: aim
only at this last colour; for it is the true sulphur, and the alchymical
powder. I say nothing precisely about the time; for that depends on the
industry of the artist; but thou canst not fail, by working as I have shewn.
<p><b>25.</b> If thou are disposed to multiply thy powder, take one part
thereof, and water it with two parts of thy animated Mercury; make it into
a soft and smooth paste; put it in a vessel as thou hast already done,
in the same furnace and fire, and concoct it. This second turn of the philosophic
wheel will be done in less time than the first, and thy powder will have
ten times more strength. Let is wheel about again even a thousand times,
and as much as thou wilt. Thou wilt then have a treasure without price,
superior to all there is in the world, and thou canst desire nothing more
here below, for thou hast both health and riches, if thou useth them properly.
<p><b>26.</b> Thou hast now the treasure of all worldly felicity, which
I a poor country clown of Pointoise did accomplish three times in Paris,
in my house, in the street des Ecrivains, near the chapel of St. Jacques
de la Boucherie, and which I Flammel give thee, for the love I bear thee,
to the honour of God, for His glory, for the praise of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit. Amen.
<p>The French correspondent [who had provided the French version to the
editor for translation into English for this publication of 1806] adds:
"This is what I find at the end of the Manuscript"'
<p>They assert that the original of this work was written upon the margin
of a vellum Psalm-book, in Nicholas Flamel’s own handwriting in favour
of his nephew. The process was written in cyphers, the better to conceal
the secret. Each letter was shaped in four different ways, so that to make
up the whole alphabet therewith 96 letters were employed. Father Pernetti
and Monsieur de Saint Marc decyphered this writing with much difficulty.
M. de St. Marc was on the point of giving it up; but Father Pernetti, who
had already found out the vowels, encouraged him to go on with the work,
which they at last overcame, with complete success, about the year 1758.
