<p>When Sol in Aries and Phoebus shines bright,
<br>The Elements reviving the new Year springing
<br>The Son by his Vertue gives Nature &amp; Light,
<br>And moysture refresheth all things growing:
<br>In the season of the Yeare when the Sun waxeth warme,
<br>Freshly and fragrante the Flowers doe grow,
<br>Of Natures subtill working we cannot discerne,
<br>Nor yet by our Reason we can it not know,
<br>In foure Elements is comprehended things Three,
<br>Animalls, Vegetabills, Mineralls must be,
<br>Of this is our Principle that we make our Stone,
<br>Quality and Quantity is unknowne to many one.
<p>Quality (Father) would I faine know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Of what nature it is and what it hath in his kinde.
<p>As Colours divers which on the ground do grow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<i>Father.</i>
<br>Keep well this secret (Son) and marke it in thy minde.
<p>Without Proportion (Father) how should I it know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>This working now is far from my minde
<p>Nature and kinde (Son) together do grow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father</i>.
<br>Quality by waight (Son) shalt thow never finde.
<p>To Separate Elements (Father) I must needes know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Either in Proportion which be more or less.
<p>Out of our Principle foure Elements thou shalt draw,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>Thou shalt neede nothing else that needefull is;
<br>Our Principle in quality is so perfectly mixed,
<br>By vertue of the Son and his quality,
<br>So equally Joyned, so well mixed may be.
<p>This Principle (Father) is but one thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Good (Father) tel me where it doth grow.
<p>In every place (Son) you shall him well finde;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>By Tast and by Colour thou shalt him well know;
<br>Fowle in the Ayer with it doe fly,
<br>And Fishes doe swim there with in the Sea,
<br>With Reason of Angels you may it diserne,
<br>Both Man and Woman to governe,
<br>With our fixed Body (Son) we must thus begin.
<br>Of him make Mercury and Water cleare,
<br>Man and Woman is them within,
<br>Married together by vertue of our Fire,
<br>The Woman in he working is full wild,
<br>Be well aware she goe not out;
<br>Till she have conceived and borne a Chylde,
<br>Then all his kin on him shal lout;
<br>In their workes they be unstable,
<br>The Elements they be so raw;
<br>And their Colour so variable,
<br>As sometyme like the head of a Crow,
<br>When he is black ye may well like,
<br>Putrefaction must go beforne,
<br>After Blacke he wilbe White,
<br>Then Thank ye God the Chyld is borne.
<br>This Chyld is both King and Emperour,
<br>Through his region both far and neere;
<br>All the World doth him honour,
<br>By the vertue he hath taken of the Fire:
<br>His first Vertue is White and pure,
<br>As any Christall shining cleere,
<br>Of White tincture then be you sure;
<br>By vertue taken of our Fire,
<br>His first Vesture that is so White,
<br>Betokeneth his Virginity,
<br>A similitude even thereto like,
<br>And according to the Trinity:
<br>Our Medicen is made of things Three,
<br>Against which the Philosophers cannot say nay,
<br>The Father, the Sone in one degree,
<br>Corpus, Spiritus &amp; Anima.
<br>When Nature is with Nature, thou mayst fruite finde,
<br>By proportion more or lesse,
<br>In practice hereof many men be blinde,
<br>Because they understand not what Nature is;
<br>His second Vesture as Gold is Red,
<br>In his Vessel bright shining,
<br>A Daidem set on his head,
<br>Richer than any earthly thing.
<br>His third Vesture is Purple pure,
<br>Like Sun-beames he shineth bright and clere,
<br>Of Red tincture then be you sure:
<br>By the vertue he hath taken our Fire.
<br>My beloved Son I command thee,
<br>As thou wilt have my love and blessing,
<br>That unto God kneele on thy knee,
<br>Unto him give laude and thankeing;
<br>For theis guifts of grace geven unto thee,
<br>To have trew knowledge of this worthy Scyence,
<br>That many men seeke by land and sea,
<br>And cannot finde it for any expence:
<br>I shall shew thee my Son a hid Secret,
<br>Beacause thou art vertuous in thy living,
<br>Of me else shouldst thou never it weet,
<br>And for thou art wife in thy Councell keeping,
<br>And therefore I charge thee on my blessing,
<br>Not to shew it to any man living,
<br>For it is the first Principle of our blessed Stone,
<br>Through which our noble worke is releeved,
<br>Note well that I shew now to thee my Son,
<br>If Sulphur be absent our worke is deprived;
<br>Our Sulphur my Son is Water and Fire,
<br>Constraining the Body till it be dead,
<br>Oh hem thou hast never thy desire,
<br>Till he be bloe as any Lead,
<br>After all this he doth revive,
<br>That in his Vessel before was dead;
<br>I can no better in my reason contrive,
<br>Then to figure him to the greate God head.
<br>For as there dyedno more then One,
<br>Howbeit that there be persons Three,
<br>The Father, The Sone by might is one:
<br>The holy Ghost make full our Trinity:
<br>A similitude like unto our Stone,
<br>In him ben things three which be concluded all in one,
<br>Our Sulphur is likened to the holy Ghost,
<br>For he is quick, called the Spirit of Slyfe,
<br>In his working of might he is most.
<br>He raiseth our Body from death to lyfe,
<br>Many (my Son) with him do rife,
<br>The holy Gospell therein is expert,
<br>The number of my reason cannot contrive,
<br>Multum &amp; quantum fructum adsert:
<br>I liken our Sulphur to the Adamant Stone,
<br>That Steele drawes to him naturally,
<br>So doth our Sulphur the woman,
<br>When she from her husband would flye.
<p>I muse greatly (Father) and mervaile in minde,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Whereof this Stone is ingendered,
<br>And also of what manner of kinde,
<br>For I have traveled many a Country,
<br>In vallies low and on hills high,
<br>And spurred therefore of foes and freind,
<br>Yet could I never that Sulphur see,
<br>Nor in any place wat I where him to finde.
<p>Son he is made of the Elements,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>That God hath given both soule and lyfe,
<br>From Mettall he may never be absent,
<br>For he rules both man and wife.
<p>Father I pray you for charity,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Where shall I this Sulphur finde,
<br>For perfectly I know him not by quality,
<br>Nor yet to fore know him by kinde.
<p>In our Water Son keep this in minde,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father</i>.
<br>For there he will appear as white as snow.
<p>Gramarcy Father to me ye be full kinde,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>For through your teaching full well I it know,
<br>Now Father I pray you for charity,
<br>The while it is in your minde,
<br>To ken the red Sulphur that you will teach me,
<br>And then I trust your Doctrine to finde.
<p>White and Red Son be both one in kinde,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>Now hast thou all thy desire,
<br>Keepe well this secret and close it in thy minde,
<br>His tincture and growing is by vertue of our Fire,
<br>For in our Fire our Stone will grow,
<br>And there his riches he doth encrease,
<br>And so doth no Stone that I do know,
<br>That in the fire will put him in prease;
<br>We liken him therefore unto the Sun,
<br>That to all Elements giveth light.
<br>Never sith the World was begun,
<br>Was any but he of so much might,
<br>Were he never of so high degree,
<br>Saphir, Diamond or Emarald Stone,
<br>The Turcas, or the rich Ruby,
<br>Of all vertuous Stones set ower alone,
<br>The greatest Carbuncle that is full of light,
<br>May not with our Stone Compaire,
<br>For if they in the Fire should fight,
<br>The Carbuncle of vertue should be full bare,
<br>To destroy our Stone, Son that will not be,
<br>The Elements in him be so equall;
<br>He is an Oyle incumbustible,
<br>And of all things most imperiall.
<p>In which Elements (Father) is our Sulphur in?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Is he in all, or in any one?
<p>In all (Son) he needes must be,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>For Seperation of Elements make we none,
<br>Sulphur in Elements Son we may not see,
<br>By Nature in them he is so privily mixed,
<br>In Elements he is a quality,
<br>Our Stone will never else be perfectly fixed.
<br>Quality (Son) growes also in fire,
<br>Betwixt the White Stone and the Redd,
<br>For many Colours there will appere,
<br>While the tyme the Woman be dead.
<p>Father must the Woman needes be dead?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<p>Our Stone else my Son will never be Redd;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>For whereas a Woman is in presence,
<br>There is much moysture and accidence,
<br>Wetnes and humours in her be,
<br>The which would drown'd our Quality;
<br>Perceive well (Son) by Noahs flood,
<br>To much moysture was never good.
<br>Like as quality is hid in quantity,
<br>So must our Erth in Waters be,
<br>The riches in him thou shalt finde,
<br>After alteration of kinde,
<br>His Oyle in him is congelate,
<br>This makes our Body liquefact,
<br>Sulphur and Oyle all of one kinde,
<br>Which makes oure Stone rich and couloring,
<br>I cannot tell thee Son a richer thing,
<br>Then he is in the Fire during,
<br>The Fire to him may do no wrong,
<br>Sulphur of Nature makes him so strong.
<p>How to make our Stone (Father) I would faine know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<p>In soft heates my (Son) Elements will meete,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>Hast not to fast whilst they be rawe,
<br>In the Vessell (Son) the better thou shalt him keepe,
<br>Rule well the Fire and beware of the Lawe,
<br>Shut well the Vessell for going forth of the Spirit;
<br>Soe shall you all things the better keepe;
<br>For how to get him againe it is strange to know,
<br>It is hard for some men to make Elements meete,
<br>Keepe well this Secret Son and God daily praise,
<br>Put into tht Vessell Water cleare,
<br>And set it in Fire full forty dayes,
<br>And then in the Vessell blackness will appeare,
<br>When that he is black he will change tyte,
<br>Many Colers in him then will appeare,
<br>From coulour to colour till it be white,
<br>The it is tyme Son to change the Fire,
<br>And melt the heat to your desire,
<br>And if you will have him White still,
<br>Then must you your Medicine apply,
<br>A dry Fire put him till,
<br>And a moyst Fire naturally,
<br>Till he be made fixed,
<br>For to take Mercury before his flight,
<br>As he is by nature privily mixed,
<br>Of fusion then he shalbe light,
<br>And if you to his proportion take,
<br>Fine Luna then will he make,
<br>So micle of piercing will he be,
<br>Both fluxible with penetrabilitie;
<br>And (Son) if thou wilt have thy Medicine Red,
<br>In a dry Fire thou shalt him keepe,
<br>Ever still in one steed,
<br>That never your Vessell come to wet.
<p>So hard, so heavy and so peircing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>(Father) this a wonderous thing,
<br>So hot, so moyst, so light, so wet,
<br>This greate Secret Father will I keepe,
<br>So white, so red, so profitable,
<br>Of all Stones most incomparable.
<p>He may do more than any King,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>He is so rich Son in his working,
<br>Gould and Silver men would faine have,
<br>Poore and rich for it do crave,
<br>Thay that of it have most aboundance,
<br>Of the people have most obaisance,
<br>To serve them both day and night,
<br>And in the feeld will for it fight,
<br>Therefore Son upon my blessing,
<br>Keepe secretly this precious cunning,
<br>Of thy Councell make neither King nor Knight,
<br>If they knew they would set it light;
<br>For when they have what they will,
<br>God's curse wil come they say the untill,
<br>For had I wist and had I wend,
<br>That commeth evermore behinde,
<br>Our Mercury my (Son) is white and thin,
<br>In our Vessell shinimg bright and cleere,
<br>Our Sulphur is in him within,
<br>Burning him more then our dry Fire,
<br>He fixes him more in one yeare,
<br>By his naturall working I understand,
<br>Then doth the Sonne by his dry Fire,
<br>The years a long thousand,
<br>In short space we may have done,
<br>When our Medicine thou wilt assay,
<br>Thou maist make both Sol and Lune,
<br>In lesse space then in one day.
<p>Father is it Water in the well springing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>Or is it the Water in the river running?
<br>Other Water (Father) can I not finde.
<p>Noe (Son) it is of another kinde,
<br>Howbeit it is Water cleere,
<br>Our Sulphur in him is soe cleving,
<br>He may not be departed by any fire,
<br>I tell thee the throath in this thing.
<p>By no fire (Father) how may that be?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<p>Fire he is ever brenning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>Our Sulphur is made of the Sun and such humidity
<br>That in the Fire he is ever during.
<p>The tyme of our working would I know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Son.</i>
<br>In what space might be made our Stone,
<br>By Corne and Frut (Son) thou maist it wel know.
<br>Once in a yeare it is afore thee done;
<br>The Sun in the Zodiak about doth gonne,
<br>Though the twelve Signes once in a yeare,
<br>Soe long it is ere we can make our Stone.
<p>Haste not too fast but rule well thy Fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Father.</i>
<br>The vertue of our Stone few men can tell,
<br>The Elements in him be so mighty,
<br>Aboundance of treasure in him do dwell;
<br>For in riches all Stones exceeds he.
