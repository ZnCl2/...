<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>This Epistle as it was imediately written to a King, who was in his
generation, both wise and valiant, so it doth comprise the whole secret,
both learnedly described, and yet Artificially vailed, yet as the Author
testifieth, that in this Epistle he doth plainly untie the main knot. So
I can and do testifie with him, that there is nothing desirable for the
true attaining of the mysterie, both in Theory and Practick of it, which
is not in this short Epistle fully taught. This then I intend as a key
to all my former writings, and assure you on my faithful word doubtfully
or mystically, as I have in all my other writings, seeming to aver some
things which taken without a figure, are utterly false, which we did onely
to conceal this Art: This key therefore we intend not to make common; and
shall intreat you to keep it secret to your self, and not to communicate
it, except it be to a sure friend, who you are confident will not make
it publick. And this request we make upon very good grounds, knowing that
all our writings together, are nothing to this, by reasons of the contradictions
wch we have woven into them, which here is not done in the least measure.
I shall therefore in this Epistle take up a new method, and that different
from the former, and shall first draw up the substance of the Philosophy
couched in this Epistle, into several Conclusions, and after elucidate
the same.
<p>The first Conclusion is drawn from the nineth stave of this Epistle,
the eight first staves being only complemental, and that is, That as all
things are multiplyed in their kind, so may be Mettals, which have in themselves
a capacity of being transmuted, the imperfect to perfect.
<p>The second Conclusion in the tenth stave is, That the main ground for
the possibility of transmutation, is the possibility of reduction of all
Mettals, and such Minerals as are of Mettallick principles, into their
first Mercurial matter.
<p>The third Conclusion is in the eleventh stave, That among so many Mettaline
or Mineral Sulphurs and so many Sulphurs there are but two that are related
to our work, which Sulphurs have their Mercuries essentially united to
them.
<p>The fourth conclusion from the same stave is, That he who understands
these two Sulphurs and Mercuries aright, shall find that the one is the
most pure red Sulphur of gold, which is Sulphur in manifesto and Mercurius
in occulto, and that other is most pure white Mercury, which is indeed
true quicksilver, in manifesto and Sulphur in occulto, these are our two
principles.
<p>The fifth Conclusion from the twelfth stave is, That is a mans principles
be true, and his operations regular, his event will be certain, which event
is no other than the true mystery.
<p>These Conclusions are but few in number, but of great weight, the amplification,
illustration, and ilucidation therefore of them will make a Son of Art
truly glad.
<p>For the first, Forasmuch as it is not for our purpose here to invite
any to the Art, onely intending to lead and guide the Sons of Art; we shall
not prove the possibility of Alchimy, by many arguments, having done it
abundantly in another Treatise. He then that will be incredulous, let him
be incredulous, he that will cavil, let him cavil; but he whose minde is
perswaded of the truth of the Art, and of it’s dignity, let him attend
to what is in the Illustration of these five Conclusions discovered, and
his heart shall certainly rejoyce.
<p>We shall therefore briefly Illustrate this first Conclusion, and insist
there are more largely, where the secrets of the Art are most couched.
<br>For this first then which concluded in effect the truth of the Art,
and its reality, he that would therein be more satisfied in it, let him
read the Testimony of all Philosophers, and he that will not believe the
Testimonies of so many men, being most of them, men of renown in their
own time, he will cavill also against all other Arguments.
<p>We shall onely hold to Riplyes Testimony in this our key, who in the
fourth stave, assures the King that at Lovain he first saw the greatest
and most perfect secrets, namely the two Elixers; And in this following
verse, craves his confident credit, that he hath himself truly found the
way of secret Alchimy, and promiseth the discovery of it to the King, onely
upon condition of secrecy.
<p>And in the eighth stave, though he protests never to write it by pen,
yet proffers the King at his pleasure, to shew him ocularly the red and
white Elixer, and the working of them, which he promiseth will be done
for easies costs in time. So then he that will doubt the truth of the Art,
must account this famous Author, for a most simple mad Sophister, to write
and offer such things to his Prince, unles he were able in effect to do
what he promised, from which imputation his writings, and also the histories
of him, of his fame, gravity, and worth will sufficiently cleer him.
<p>We now come to the second Conclusion, the substance of which is, that
all Mettals and bodies of Metaline principles, may be reduced to their
first Mercurial matter, and this is the main and chief ground for the possibility
of transmutation. On this we must insist largely &amp; fully, for (trust
me) this is the very hinge on which our secrets hang.
<p>First, then know that all the Mettals, and serveral Minerals have Mercury
for their next matter, to which (for the most part, nay indeed always)
there adheres, and is concoagulated an external Sulphur, which is not Mettaline,
but distinguishable from the internal kerne of the Mercury.
<p>This Sulphur is not wanting even in common Argent vive, by the Mediation
of which, it may be precipitated into the form of a dry pouder. Yea and
by a liqour (the Alchahest) well known to us, (though nothing helping of
this Art of transmutation) it may be so fixed, that it may endure all fires,
the Test and Coppel, and this without the addition of any thing to it,
the liquor (by vertue whereof it is fixed) coming away intire, both in
its Pondus and vertue.
<p>This Sulphur in gold and silver is pure, in the other Mettals it is
less pure, therefore in gold and silver it is fixed, in others it is fugitve,
in all the Mettals it is coagulated; in Mercury or Argent vive, it is coagulable;
in gold, silver and Mercury, this Sulphur is so strongly united, that the
Antients did ever judge Sulphur and Mercury to be all one, but we by the
help of the liquor, (the Alcahest) the invention of which, in these parts
of the World we owe to Paracelsus (though among the Moors and Arabians
it hath been and is (at this day) commonly known to the acuter sort of
chemists) but this I say we know that the Sulphur which is in Mercury coagulable,
and in the Mettals coagulated, is external to the nature of Mercury, and
may be separated in the form of a tinctured Mettalick Oyle, the remaining
Mercury being then void of all Sulphur, save that which may be called its
inward Sulphur, and is now incoagulable of it self (Though by our Elixer
it is to be coagulated) but of itself, it can neither be fixt nor precipitated,
nor sublimed, but remains unaltered in all corrosive waters, and in all
digestions of heat. One way then of Mercury azating all Mettals and Minerals,
is by the liquor Alcahest, which out of all such bodies as have Mercury
in their constitution, can separate a running Argent vive, from which Argent
vive all its sulphur is then separated, save that onely which is internal
and central to the Mercury, which internal Sulphur of Mercury no corrosive
can touch, Next to this way of universal Reduction, there are also some
other particular wayes, by which Lead, Tin, Antimony, yea, even Copper,
and Iron may be reduced into a running quicksilver, by the help of Salts,
which because (being corporeal) they pierce not so radically as the forenamed
liquor doth, they therefore do not spoile the Mercury of its Sulphur but
that as much Sulphur as there is in common Mercury, so much also there
is in this Mercury of the bodies, onely this Mercury hath specificated
qualities according to the nature of the Mattal or Mineral, from which
it was extracted, and from that reason (as to our work, which is to dissolve
perfect species of Mettals) it hath no more vertue than common Argent vive:
There is then but only one humidity, which is applicable unto our work,
which certainly is neither Tin nor Copper, nor is drawn from any thing,
which nature hath formed, but from a substance compounded by the Art of
the Philosopher. So then, if a Mercury drawn from the bodies, have not
onely the same deficiency of heat and superfluity of foeces as common Mercury
hath, but also a distinct specificated form, it must (by reason of this
its form) be so much the farther remote from our Mercury then common Argent
vive is.
<p>Our Art therefore is to compound two principles (one in which the salt,
and another in which the Mercury of nature doth abound) which are not yet
perfect, nor yet totally imperfect and (by consequence) may therefore (by
our Art) be exalted which that (which is totally perfect) cannot be: and
then by common Mercury to extract not the Pondus, but the celestial vertue
out of the compound, which vertue (being fermental) begets in the common
Mercury an off-spring more noble than it self, which is our true Hermaphrodite,
which will congeal it self, and dissolve the bodies; observe but a grain
of Corn in which scarce a discernable part is sprout, and this sprout,
if it were out of the grain, would dye in a moment; the whole grain is
sowen, yet the sprout onely produceth the herb: So is it in our body, the
fermental spirit that is in it, is scarce a third part of the whole, the
rest is of no value, yet all is joyned in the compositition, and the faeculent
corporeous, part of the body comes away with the dreggs of the Mercury.
But beyond the example given of a grain it may be observed that the hidden
and spiritual vertue of this our body, doth purge and purifie its matrix
of water, in which it os sowen, that is, it makes it cast forth a great
quantity of filthy earth, and a great deal of Hydropical saline moisture.
For instance thy washings (for a tryall) with pure clean fountain water,
weigh first a pint of the same water, and take the exact weight of it,
then wash thy compound eight or ten times, save all the faeces, weigh thy
body and Mercury exactly, weigh thy faeces being very dry, then distill
or sublime all that will sublime a very little quick Mercury will ascend;
then put the Residue of the faeces in a crucible, set them on the coals,
and all the faeculency of the Mercury will burn like a coal, yet without
fume; when that is all consumed, weigh the remaining faeces, and thou shalt
find them to be two thirds of thy body, the other being in the Mercury,
weigh the Mercury which thou sublimedst, and the Mercury prepared by itself,
and the weight of both will not recompence thy Mercury weight by farre.
So then boile up thy water to a skin, in which thou madest thy Lotions,
for that is a thick water: and in a cool place thou shalt have Christals,
which is the salt of Mercury Crude, and no way fit for Medicines: yet it
is a content for the Artists to see how the Heterogeneyties of Mercury
are discovered, which no other Art save the liquor of Alcahest can do,
and that in a destructive, and not a generative way as this is, for this
operation of ours is made between male and female, within their own kind,
between which there is a ferment which effecteth that which no other thing
in the world could do. In all truth, I tell you, that if you should take
our imperfect compound body, per se, and Mercury, per se, and them alone,
though you might bring out of the one a most pure Sulphur, and out of the
other a Mercury of Mercury, which is the nut of Mercury, yet with these
thou couldst effect nothing, for fermental virtue is the wonder of the
World, and it is by it, that water becomes Herbs, Trees, and Plants, Fruits,
Flesh, Blood, Stones, Minerals, and everything, look then for it onely,
and rejoyce in it as in a deservedly invaluable treasure; Now know that
fermentation, works not out of kind, neither do salts ferment Mettals;
Wilt thou know then whence it is that some fixt Alcalyes do extract a Mercury
out of Minerals, and out of the more imperfect Metals, consider then, that
in all these bodies the Sulphur is not so radically mixt and united, as
it is in Silver and Gold. Now Sulphur is of Kin to divers Alcalyes, that
are ordinarily dissolved or melted with it, and by this means the Mercurial
parts are disjoyned, and the Argent vive is by fire separated. The Mercury
thus separated, is spoyled of its Sulphur when as indeed there needs onely
a depuration of the Sulphur by separating the impure from the pure; but
these salts having separated the Sulpher do leave the Mercury worse, that
is, more estranged from a Metallick nature, than it was before, for in
its composition that Sulphur of Saturn will not burn, but though it be
sublimed, calcined, made sugar, or vitrefied, yet by fire and fluxes it
still returns to the same it was in before, but its Sulphur being (as is
aforesaid) separated, will take fire, if joyned with Salt-peter, even as
common Sulphur doth, so that the Salts act on the Sulphur of which they
rob the Mercury; they act not on the Mercury for want of ferment which
is not to be found, but onely among Homogeneall things. Therefore the ferment
of bread leavens not a stone, nor doth the ferment of anyanimal or vigetable,
ferment a mettal or mineral.
<p>So then, though our Gold thou mightest obtaine a Mercury by the help
of the Liquor, of that first ens of Salt, yet that Mercury would never
accomplish our work, whereason the otherside Mercury made out of Gold by
our Mercury, though there be three parts of our Mercury to one of the Gold,
This Mercury I say will (by continual digestion) accomplish the whole work;
marvell not then, that our Mercury is more powerfull, which is prepared
by Mercury; for certainly the ferment, which commeth between the compound
Body and the Water, causeth a death, and a regeneration, it doth that,
which nothing in the world can do, besides it severs from Mercury a terrestreity,
which burns like a Coale, and an Hydropical humor melting in common water,
but the residue is acuated by a Spirit of life, which is our true embryonated
Sulphur of our water, not visible, yet working visibly. We conclude, that
all operations for our Mercury but by common Mercury, and our body according
to our Art are erronious, and will never produce our mystery, although
they be otherwise never so wonderfull. For as the Author of the Newlight
saith, No water in any Island of the Phylosophers, was wholesome, but that
which was drawn out of the reines of the Soll and Luna. Wilt thou know
what that meanes? Mercury in its pondus and incombustibility is Gold fugitive,
our Body in its purity, is called the Phylosophers Luna being farre more
pure than the imperfect mettals and its Sulphur also as pure as the Sulphur
of Soll, not that it is indeed Luna, for it abides not in the fire, now
in the composition of these three (1) our common Mercury and the two principles
of our compound there interceeds, the ferment of Luna, out of which though
it be a Body, proceeds yet a specificating odor: yea and oft the pondus
of it is diminished: If the compound be much washt, after it is sufficiently
clean. So then the ferment of Soll and Luna interceeds in our composition,
which ferment begets an offspring, more noble than it self a 1000 fold,
wheas should’st thou work on our compound Body by a violent way of Salts,
thou should’st have thy Mercury by farre less noble, than the Body, the
Sulphur of the Body being separated and not exalted by such a process.
<p>We now come to the third conclusion, which is that among all metaline
and mineral Sulphur there are onely two, that belong to our work, which
two have their Mercuries essentially united with them. This is the truth
of our secrets, though we (to seduce the unwary) do seem to aver the contrary,
for do not think that (because we do insinuatetwo waies, therefore) we
really mean as we say, for verily (as witnesseth Ripley) There is no true
principle but one. Nor have we but one matter, not but one regimen of heat,
and one linear way of proceeding.
<p>These two Sulphurs as they are principles of our work, they ought to
be homogeneal, for it is onely Gold spiritual that we seek, first white,
then red, which Gold is no other then that which the vulgar see, but they
know not the hidden spirit that is in it. This principle wants nothing
but Composition, and this composition must be made, with our other crude
white Sulphur which is nothing but Mercury vulgar, by frequent cohobation
of it upon our Hermaphroditical Body, so long till it be come a fiery water.
<p>Know therefore that Mercury hath in its self a Sulphur, which being
unactive, our Art is to multiply in it a living active Sulphur, which comes
out of the loyns of our Hermaphroditical Body, whose father is a metal
and his mother a mineral, Take then the most beloved daughter of Saturn,
whose armes are a circle Argent, and on it a sable cross on a blackfield,
which is the signall note of the great World, espouse her to the most warlike
God, who dwells in the house of Aries, and thou shalt find the Salt of
Nature, with this Salt acuate thy water, as thou best knowest, and thou
shalt have the Lunary bath, in which the Sun will be ammended.
<p>And in all truth I assure thee, that although though hadst our body
Mercurialized (without the addition of Mercury of any of the metals) made
per se, that is without the addition of Mercury, it would not be in the
least profitable unto thee, for it is Mercury onely, which hath a Celestial
form and power, which it receives, not onely, nor so much from the compound
body, as from the fermental virtue which proceeds from the composition
of both the body and the Mercury, by which is produced a wonderfull Creature:
So then let all thy care be to marry Sulphur with Suphur, that is our Mercury
which is impraegnated, which Sulphur, must be espoused with our Sol then
hast thou two Sulphurs married and two Mercuries of one off spring, whose
father is the Sol, and Luna the mother.
<p>The fourth Conclusion makes all perfectly plain, which hath been said
before, namely that these two Sulphurs are the one most pure red Sulphur
of Gold, and the other of most pure clean white Mercury.
<p>These are our two Sulphurs, the one appears a coagulated body, and yet
carries its Mercury in its belly: the other is in all its proportions true
Mercury, yet very clean and carries its Sulphur within its self, though
hidden under the form and fluxibilitie of Mercury.
<p>Sophisters are (here) in a labyrinth, for because they are not acquainted
with metalline love, they work in things altogether heterogeneal, or if
they work upon metalline bodies they yet either joyne males with males,
or females with females, or else they work on each alone, or else they
take males, which are charged with natural inabilities, and females whose
matrix is vitiated. Thus by there own inconsideration they frustrate their
own hopes, and then cast the blame upon the Art, when as indeed it is onely
to be imputed to their own folly, in not understanding the Phylosophers.
<p>I know many pittifull Sophisters do dote on many Stones, vigitable,
animal, and mineral, and some to those add the firey Angelical, Paradaical
Stone, which they call a wonder working essence, and because the mark they
aim at, is so great, the Waies also, by which they would attain their Scope,
they make also a double, one Way they call the Via Humida, the other, the
Via Sicca, (to use their languages).
<p>The latter way is the labirinthian path, which is fit onely for the
great ones of the earth to tread in, the other the dedalean path, an easie
way of small cost for the poor of the world, to enterprize.
<p>But this I know and can testifie that there is but one Way, and but
onely one Regimen, no more Colours than ours, and what we say or write
otherwise, is but to deceive the unwary, for if every thing in the world
ought to have its proper causes, there cannot be any one end, which is
produced from two waies of working on distinct principles. Therefore we
protest and must again admonish the Reader that (in our former writings)
we have concealed much, by reason of the two waies we have insinuated,
which is the play of children, and the work of women, and that is decoction
by the fire, and we protest that the lowest degree of this our work, is
that the matter be stirred up, and may hourly circulate without feare of
breaking the vessel, which for this reason ought to be very strong, but
our linear decoction is an internal work, which advances every day and
hour, and is distinct from that outward heat, and is therefore invisible
and insensible. In this our work, our Diana is our body when it is mixed
with the water, for then all is called the Moon, for Laton is whitened,
and the woman beares rule, our Diana hath a wood, for in the first dayes
of the Stone, our body after it is whitened grows vegitably. In this wood,
are at the last found two Doves, for about the end of three weeks, the
soul of the Mercury ascends, with the soul of the dissolved Gold, these
are in folded in the everlasting armes of Venus, for in this season the
confection are all tincted with a pure green colour, these Doves are circulated
seven times, for in seven is perfecton, and they are left dead, for they
can rise and move no more, our Body is then black like to a Crowes bill,
for in this operation all is turned to pouder, blacker than the blackest.
Such passages as these we do oftentimes use, when we speak of the preparation
of our Mercury, and this we do to deceive the simple, and it is also for
no other end that we confound our operations speaking of one, when we ought
to speak of another, for if this Art were but plainly set down, our operations
would be contemptible even to the foolish. Therefore believe me in this,
that because our workes are truly Natural, we therefore do take the liberty
to confound the Phylosophers work, with that which is purely Natures work,
that so we might keep the simple in ignorance, concerning our true Vinegre,
which being unknown, their labor is wholly lost.
<p>Let me then (for a close) say onely thus much; Take our Body which is
Gold, and our Mercury which is seven times acuated by the marriage of it,
with our Hermaphroditicall Body, which is in a Chaos, and is the splendor
of the soul of the God Mars, in the earth, and water of Saturn, mix these
two in such a pondus as nature doth require, In this mixture you have our
invisible fires, for in the water of our Mercury is an active Sulphur or
mineral fire and in the Gold a dead passive, but yet actual Sulphur now
when that Sulphur of the Gold is stirred up and quickened, there is made
between the fire of nature, which is as the Gold, and the fire against
nature, which is in the Mercury, a fire partly of the one and partly of
the other, for it partakes of both, and by these two fires thus united
into one, is caused both Corruption (which is Humiliation) and generation
(which is Glorification and Perfection:) Now know that God onely governs
this way of the internal fire, man being ignorant of the progress thereof,
onely by his reason beholding its operations, he is able to discern that
it is hot, that is, that it doth perform the action of heat, which is decoction,
In this fire there is no sublimation, for sublimation is an exaltation,
but this fire is such an exaltation, as that beyond it, is no perfection.
<p>All our work then is onely to multiply this fire, that is to circulate
the body so long until the vertue of the Sulphur be augmented. Again this
fire is an invisible Spirit, and therefore not having dimentions, is neither
above nor below, but everywhere in the Sphere of the activity of our matter
in the Vessel: So that though the material visible substance do sublime
and ascend by the action of the elemental heat, yet this spiritual virtue
is alway as well as in that which remains in the bottom, as in that which
is in the upper part of the Vessel. For it is as the soul in the body of
man, which is everywhere at the same time, and yet bounded or termined
in none.
<p>This is the ground of one Sophisus of ours, (viz.) when we say that
in this true Philosophical fire, there is no sublimation, for the fire
is the life, and the life is a soul, which is not at all subject to the
dimensions of Bodies, Hence also it is that the opening of the Glass or
cooling of the same during the time of working kills the life or fire,
that is in this secret Sulphur, and yet not one grain of the mettal is
lost. The elemental fire then is that which any child knowes how to kindle
and govern, but it is the Philosopher onely, that is able to discern the
true inward fire for it is a wonderful thing, which acts in the body, yet
is no part of the body. Therefore the fire is a celestial virtue it is
uniformed, that is, it is alwaies the same until the period of its operation
is come, and then being come to perfection it acts no more, for every Agent,
when the end of its action is come then rests.
<p>Remember then that when we speak of our fire which sublimes not, that
thou do not mistake and think that the moisture of the compound which is
within the Glass ought not to sublime, for that it must do uncesantly,
but that the fire that sublimes not, is the metalline love, which is above
and below and in all places alike. Now then for a close to all that hath
been said, learn and be well advised what matter you take in hand, for
an evil Crow laies an evil Egg, as the proverb hath it, let thy seed be
pure, the shalt thou see a noble offspring, let the fire without be such,
as in which our confections may play to &amp; fro uncessantly, &amp; this
(in a few daies) will produce that which thou most longeth for, the Crows
Bill.
