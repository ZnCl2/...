<p><b><i><font size=+1>The Book Concerning the Tincture of the Philosophers</font></i></b>
<p>Written against Those Sophists Born since the Deluge, In the Age of
Our Lord Jesus Christ, The Son of God.
<p><b><font size=+1>By Ph. Theophrastus Bombast, of Hohenheim,</font></b>
<p>Philosopher of the Monarchia, Prince of Spagyrists, Chief Astronomer,
Surpassing Physician, and Trismegistus of Mechanical Arcana.
<p><b><font size=+1>Preface</font></b>.</center>

<p>Since you, O Sophist, everywhere abuse me with such fatuous and mendacious
words, on the ground that being sprung from rude Helvetia I can understand
and know nothing: and also because being a duly qualified physician I still
wander from one district to another; therefore I have proposed by means
of this treatise to disclose to the ignorant and inexperienced: what good
arts existed in the first age; what my art avails against you and yours
against me; what should be thought of each, and how my posterity in this
age of grace will imitate me. Look at Hermes, Archelaus, and others in
the first age: see what Spagyrists and what Philosophers then existed.
By this they testify that their enemies, who are your patrons, O Sophist,
at the present time are but mere empty forms and idols. Although this would
not be attested by those who are falsely considered your authentic fathers
and saints, yet the ancient Emerald Table shews more art and experience
in Philosophy, Alchemy, Magic, and the like, than could ever be taught
by you and your crowd of followers. If you do not yet understand, from
the aforesaid facts, what and how great treasures these are, tell me why
no prince or king was ever able to subdue the Egyptians. Then tell me why
the Emperor Diocletian ordered all the Spagyric books to be burnt (so far
as he could lay his hands upon them). Unless the contents of those books
had been known, they would have been obliged to bear still his intolerable
yoke, --- a yoke, O Sophist, which shall one day be put upon the neck of
yourself and your colleagues.
<p>From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been at
length derived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus, Prince of
Philosophy and of Medicine. For this purpose I have been chosen by God
to extinguish and blot out all the phantasies of elaborate and false works,
of delusive and presumptuous words, be they the words of Aristotle, Galen,
Avicenna, Mesva, or the dogmas of any among their followers. My theory,
proceeding as it does from the light of Nature, can never, through its
consistency, pass away or be changed: but in the fifty-eighth year after
its millennium and a half it will then begin to flourish. The practice
at the same time following upon the theory will be proved by wonderful
and incredible signs, so as to be open to mechanics and common people,
and they will thoroughly understand how firm and immovable is that Paracelsic
Art against the triflings of the Sophists: though meanwhile that sophistical
science has to have its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papal and
imperial privileges. In that I am esteemed by you a mendicant and vagabond
sophist, the Danube and the Rhine will answer that accusation, though I
hold my tongue. Those calumnies of yours falsely devised against me have
often displeased many courts and princes, many imperial cities, the knightly
order, and the nobility. I have a treasure hidden in a certain city called
Weinden, belonging to Forum Julii, at an inn, --- a treasure which neither
you, Leo of Rome, nor you, Charles the German, could purchase with all
your substance. Although the signed star has been applied to the arcanum
of your names, it is known to none but the sons of the divine Spagyric
Art. So then, you wormy and lousy Sophist, since you deem the monarch of
arcana a mere ignorant, fatuous, and prodigal quack, now, in this mid age,
I determine in my present treatise to disclose the honourable course of
procedure in these matters, the virtues and preparation of the celebrated
Tincture of the Philosophers for the use and honour of all who love the
truth, and in order that all who despise the true arts may be reduced to
poverty. By this arcanum the last age shall be illuminated clearly and
compensated for all its losses by the gift of grace and the reward of the
spirit of truth, so that since the beginning of the world no similar germination
of the intelligence and of wisdom shall ever have been heard of. In the
meantime, vice will not be able to suppress the good, nor will the resources
of those vicious persons, many though they be, cause any loss to the upright.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Book Concerning the Tincture of the Philosophers.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter I.</font></b></center>

<p>I, Phillipus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast, say that, by Divine grace,
many ways have been sought to the Tincture of the Philosophers, which finally
all came to the same scope and end. Hermes Trismegistus, the Egyptian,
approached this task in his own method. Orus, the Greek, observed the same
process. Hali, the Arabian, remained firm in his order. But Albertus Magnus,
the German, followed also a lengthy process. Each one of these advanced
in proportion to his own method; nevertheless, they all arrive at one and
the same end, at a long life, so much desired by the philosophers, and
also at an honourable sustenance and means of preserving that life in this
Valley of Misery. Now at this time, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast,
Monarch of the Arcana, am endowed by God with special gifts for this end,
that every searcher after this supreme philosophic work may be forced to
imitate and to follow me, be he Italian, Pole, Gaul, German, or whatsoever
or whosoever he be. Come hither after me, all you philosophers, astronomers,
and spagyrists, of however lofty a name ye may be, I will show and open
to you, Alchemists and Doctors, who are exalted by me with the most consummate
labours, this corporeal regeneration. I will teach you the tincture, the
arcanum, the quintessence, wherein lie hid the foundations of all mysteries
and of all works. For every person may and ought to believe in another
only in those matters, which he has tried by fire. If any one shall have
brought forward anything contrary to this method of experimentation in
the Spagyric Art or in Medicine, there is no reason for your belief in
him, since, experimentally, through the agency of fire, the true is separated
from the false. The light of Nature indeed is created in this way, that
by means thereof the proof or trial of everything may appear, but only
to those who walk in this light. With this light we will teach, by the
very best methods of demonstration, that all those who before me have approached
this so difficult province with their own fancies and acute speculations
have, to their own loss, incurred the danger of their foolishness. On which
account, from my standpoint, many rustics have been ennobled; but, on the
other hand, through the speculative and opinionative art of these many
nobles have been changed into clowns, and since they carried golden mountains
in their head before they had put their hand to the fire. First of all,
then, there must be learnt --- digestions, distillations, sublimations,
reverberations, extractions, solutions, coagulations, fermentations, fixations,
and every instrument which is requisite for this work must be mastered
by experience, such as glass vessels, cucurbites, circulators, vessels
of Hermes, earthen vessels, baths, blast-furnaces, reverberatories, and
instruments of like kind, also marble, coals, and tongs. Thus at length
you will be able to profit in Alchemy and in Medicine.
<p>But so long as, relying on fancy and opinion, you cleave to your fictitious
books, you are fitted and predestinated for no one of these things.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter II.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concnerning the Definition of the Subject and Matter
of the Tincture of the Philosophers.</font></b></center>

<p>Before I come, then, to the process of the Tincture, it is needful that
I open to you the subject thereof: for, up to the present time, this has
always been kept in a specially occult way by the lovers of truth. So,
then, the matter of the Tincture (when you understand me in a Spagyrical
sense) is a certain thing which, by the art of Vulcan, passes out of three
essences into one essence, or it may remain. But, that I may give it its
proper name, according to the use of the ancients, though it is called
by many the Red Lion, still it is known by few. This, by the aid of Nature
and the skill of the Artist himself, can be transmuted into a White Eagle,
so that out of one two are produced; and beyond this the brightness of
gold does not shine so much for the Spagyrist as do these two when kept
in one. Now, if you do not understand the use of the Cabalists and the
old astronomers, you are not born by God for the Spagyric art, or chosen
by Nature for the work of Vulcan, or created to open your mouth concerning
Alchemical Arts. The matter of the Tincture, then, is a very great pearl
and a most precious treasure, and the noblest thing next to the manifestation
of the Most High and the consideration of men which can exist upon earth.
This is the Lili of Alchemy and of Medicine, which the philosophers have
so diligently sought after, but, through the failure of entire knowledge
and complete preparation, they have not progressed to the perfect end thereof.
By means of their investigations and experiments, only the initial stage
of the Tincture has been given to us; but the true foundation, which my
colleagues must imitate, has been left for me, so that no one should mingle
their shadows with our good intentions. I, by right after my long experiences,
correct the Spagyrists, and separate the false or the erroneous from the
true, since, by long investigations, I have found reasons why I should
be able justly to blame and to change diverse things. If, indeed, I had
found out experiments of the ancients better than my own, I should scarcely
have taken up such great labours as, for the sake, the utility, and the
advantage of all good Alchemists, I have undergone willingly. Since, then,
the subject of the Tincture has been sufficiently declared, so that it
scarcely could or ought to be exceeded in fidelity between two brothers,
I approach its preparation, and after I have laid down the experiences
of the first age, I wish to add my own inventions; to which at last the
Age of Grace will by-and-by give its adhesion, whichever of the patriarchs,
O Sophist, you, in the meantime, shall have made leaders.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter III.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Process of the Ancients for the Tincture
of the Philosophers, and a More Compendious Method by Paracelsus</font></b>.</center>

<p>The old Spagyrists putrefied Lili for a philosophical month, and afterwards
distilled therefrom the moist spirits, until at length the dry spirits
were elevated. They again imbued the caput mortuum with moist spirits,
and drew them off from it frequently by distillation until the dry spirits
were all elevated. Then afterwards they united the moisture that had been
drawn off and the dry spirits by means of a pelican, three or four times,
until the whole Lili remained dry at the bottom. Although early experience
gave this process before fixation, none the less our ancestors often attained
a perfect realisation of their wish by this method. They would, however,
have had a shorter way of arriving at the treasure of the Red Lion if they
had learnt the agreement of Astronomy with Alchemy, as I have demonstrated
it in the Apocalypse of Hermes3. But since every day (as Christ says for
the consolation of the faithful) has its own peculiar care, the labour
for the Spagyrists before my times has been great and heavy; but this,
by the help of the Holy Spirit flowing into us, will, in this last age,
be lightened and made clear by my theory and practice, for all those who
constantly persevere in their work with patience. For I have tested the
properties of Nature, its essences and conditions, and I know its conjunction
and resolution, which are the highest and greatest gift for a philosopher,
and never understood by the sophists up to this time. When, therefore,
the earliest age gave the first experience of the Tincture, the Spagyrists
made two things out of one simple. But when afterwards, in the Middle Age,
this invention had died out, their successors by diligent scrutiny afterwards
came upon the two names of this simple, and they named it with one word,
namely, Lili, as being the subject of the Tincture. At length the imitators
of Nature putrefied this matter at its proper period just like the seed
in the earth, since before this corruption nothing could be born from it,
nor any arcanum break forth from it. Afterwards they drew off the moist
spirits from the matter, until at length, by the violence of the fire,
the dry were also equally sublimated, so that, in this way, just as the
rustic does at the proper time of year, they might come to maturity as
one after another is wont to ascend and to fall away. Lastly, as after
the spring comes summer, they incorporated those fruits and dry spirits,
and brought the Magistery of the Tincture to such a point that it came
to the harvest, and laid itself out for ripening.

<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter IV.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Process for the Tincture of the Philosophers,
as it is Shortened by Paracelsus</font></b>.</center>

<p>The ancient Spagyrists would not have required such lengthened labour
and such wearisome repetition if they had learnt and practised their work
in my school. They would have obtained their wish just as well, with far
less expense and labour. But at this time, when Theophrastus Paracelsus
has arrived as the Monarch of Arcana, the opportunity is at hand for finding
out those things which were occult to all Spagyrists before me. Wherefore
I say, Take only the rose-coloured blood from the Lion and the gluten from
the Eagle. When you have mixed these, coagulate them according to the old
process, and you will have the Tincture of the Philosophers, which an infinite
number have sought after and very few have found. Whether you will or not,
sophist, this Magistery is in Nature itself, a wonderful thing of God above
Nature, and a most precious treasure in this Valley of Sorrows. If you
look at it from without it seems a paltry thing to transmute another into
something far more noble than it was before. But you must, nevertheless,
allow this, and confess that it is a miracle produced by the Spagyrist,
who by the art of his preparation corrupts a visible body which is externally
vile, from which he excites another most noble and most precious essence.
If you, in like manner, have learnt anything from the light of Aristotle,
or from us, or from the rules of Serapio, come forth, and bring that knowledge
experimentally to light. Preserve now the right of the Schools, as becomes
a lover of honour and a doctor. But if you know nothing and can do nothing,
why do you despise me as though I were an irrational Helvetian cow, and
inveigh against me as a wandering vagabond? Art is a second Nature and
a universe of its own, as experience witnesses, and demonstrates against
you and your idols. Sometimes, therefore, the Alchemist compounds certain
simples, which he afterwards corrupts according to his need, and prepares
thence another thing. For thus very often out of many things one is made,
which effects more than Nature of herself can do, as in Gastaynum it is
perfectly well known that Venus is produced from Saturn; in Carinthia,
Luna out of Venus; and in Hungary, Sol out of Luna; to pass over in silence
for the time being the transmutations of other natural objects, which were
well known to the Magi, and more wonderfully than Ovid narrates in his
Metamorphoses do they come to the light. That you may rightly understand
me, seek your Lion in the East, and your Eagle in the South, for this our
work which has been undertaken. You will not find better instruments than
Hungary and Istria produce. But if you desire to lead from unity by duality
in trinity with equal permutation of each, then you should direct your
journey to the South; so in Cyprus shall you gain all your desire, concerning
which we must not dilate more profusely than we have done at present. There
are still many more of these arcana which exhibit transmutations, though
they are known to few. And although these may by the Lord God be made manifest
to anyone, still, the rumour of this Art does not on that account at once
break forth, but the Almighty gives therewith the understanding how to
conceal these and other like arts even to the coming of Elias the Artist,
at which time there shall be nothing so occult that it shall not be revealed.
You also see with your eyes (though there is no need to speak of these
things, which may be taken derisively by some) that in the fire of Sulphur
is a great tincture for gems, which, indeed, exalts them to a loftier degree
than Nature by herself could do. But this gradation of metals and gems
shall be omitted by me in this place, since I have written sufficiently
about it in my Secret of Secrets, in my book on the Vexations of Alchemists,
and abundantly elsewhere. As I have begun the process of our ancestors
with the Tincture of the Philosophers, I will now perfectly conclude it.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter V.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Conclusion of the Process of the Ancients,
Made by Paracelsus</font></b></center>

<p>Lastly, the ancient Spagyrists having placed Lili in a pelican and dried
it, fixed it by means of a regulated increase of the fire, continued so
long until from blackness, by permutation into all the colours, it became
red as blood, and therewith assumed the condition of a salamander. Rightly,
indeed, did they proceed with such labour, and in the same way it is right
and becoming that everyone should proceed who seeks this pearl. It will
be very difficult for me to make this clearer to you unless you shall have
learnt in the School of the Alchemists to observe the degrees of the fire,
and also to change your vessels. For then at length you will see that soon
after your Lili shall have become heated in the Philosophic Egg, it becomes,
with wonderful appearances, blacker than the crow; afterwards, in succession
of time, whiter than the swan; and at last, passing through a yellow colour,
it turns out more red than any blood. Seek, seek, says the first Spagyrist,
and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. It would be
impious and indecorous to put food in the mouth of a perfidious bird. Let
her rather fly to it, even as I, with others before me, have been compelled
to do. But follow true Art; for this will lead you to its perfect knowledge.
It is not possible that anything should here be set down more fully or
more clearly than I have before spoken. Let your Pharisaical schools teach
you what they will from their unstable and slippery foundation, which reaches
not its end or its aim. When at length you shall have been taught as accurately
as possible the Alchemistic Art, nothing in the nature of things shall
then at length be so difficult which cannot be made manifest to you by
the aid of this Art. Nature, indeed, herself does not bring forth anything
into the light which is advanced to its highest perfection, as can be seen
in this place from the unity, or the union, of our duality. But a man ought
by Spagyric preparations to lead it thither where it was ordained by Nature.
Let this have been sufficiently said by me, concerning the process of the
ancients and my correction of the Tincture of the Philosophers, so far
as relates to its preparation.
<p>Moreover, since now we have that treasure of the Egyptians in our hands,
it remains that we turn it to our use: and this is offered to us by the
Spagyric Magistery in two ways. According to the former mode it can be
applied for the renewing of the body; according to the latter it is to
be used for the transmutation of metals. Since, then, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus,
have tried each of them in different ways, I am willing to put them forward
and to describe them according to the signs indeed of the work, and as
in experience and proof they appeared to me better and more perfectly.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter VI.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Transmutation of Metals by the Perfection
of Medicine</font></b>.</center>

<p>If the Tincture of the Philosophers is to be used for transmutation,
a pound of it must be projected on a thousand pounds of melted Sol. Then,
at length, will a Medicine have been prepared for transmuting the leprous
moisture of the metals. This work is a wonderful one in the light of Nature,
namely, that by the Magistery, or the operation of the Spagyrist, a metal,
which formerly existed, should perish, and another be produced. This fact
has rendered that same Aristotle, with his ill-founded philosophy, fatuous.
For truly, when the rustics in Hungary cast iron at the proper season into
a certain fountain, commonly called Zifferbrunnen, it is consumed into
rust, and when this is liquefied with a blast-fire, it soon exists as pure
Venus, and never more returns to iron. Similarly, in the mountain commonly
called Kuttenberg, they obtain a lixivium out of marcasites, in which iron
is forthwith turned into Venus of a high grade, and more malleable than
the other produced by Nature. These things, and more like them, are known
to simple men rather than to sophists, namely, those which turn one appearance
of a metal into another. And these things, moreover, through the remarkable
contempt of the ignorant, and partly, too, on account of the just envy
of the artificers, remain almost hidden. But I myself, in Istria, have
often brought Venus to more than twenty-four (al. 38) degrees, so that
the colour of Sol could not mount higher, consisting of Antimony or or
Quartal, which Venus I used in all respects as other kinds.
<p>But though the old artists were very desirous of this arcanum, and sought
it with the greatest diligence, nevertheless, very few could bring it by
means of a perfect preparation to its end. For the transmutation of an
inferior metal into a superior one brings with it many difficulties and
obstacles, as the change of Jove into Luna, or Venus into Sol. Perhaps
on account of their sins God willed that the Magnalia of Nature should
be hidden from many men. For sometimes, when this Tincture has been prepared
by artists, and they were not able to reduce their projection to work its
effects, it happened that, by their carelessness and bad guardianship,
this was eaten up by fowls, whose feathers thereupon fell off, and, as
I myself have seen, grew again. In this way transmutation, through its
abuse from the carelessness of the artists, came into Medicine and Alchemy.
For when they were unable to use the Tincture according to their desire,
they converted the same to the renovation of men, as shall be heard more
at large in the following chapter.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter VII.</font></b>
<p><font size=+1><b>Concerning the Renovation of Men</b>.</font></center>

<p>Some of the first and primitive philosophers of Egypt have lived by
means of this Tincture for a hundred and fifty years. The life of many,
too, has been extended and prolonged to several centuries, as is most clearly
shewn in different histories, though it seems scarcely credible to any
one. For its power is so remarkable that it extends the life of the body
beyond what is possible to its congenital nature, and keeps it so firmly
in that condition that it lives on in safety from all infirmities. And
although, indeed, the body at length comes to old age, nevertheless, it
still appears as though it were established in its primal youth.
<p>So, then, the Tincture of the Philosophers is a Universal Medicine,
and consumes all diseases, by whatsoever name they are called, just like
an invisible fire. The dose is very small, but its effect is most powerful.
By means thereof I have cured the leprosy, venereal disease, dropsy, the
falling sickness, colic, scab, and similar afflictions; also lupus, cancer,
noli-me-tangere, fistulas, and the whole race of internal diseases, more
surely than one could believe. Of this fact Germany, France, Italy, Poland,
Bohemia, etc., will afford the most ample evidence.
<p>Now, Sophist, look at Theophrastus Paracelsus. How can your Apollo,
Machaon, and Hippocrates stand against me? This is the Catholicum of the
Philosophers, by which all these philosophers have attained long life for
resisting diseases, and they have attained this end entirely and most effectually,
and so, according to their judgment, they named it The Tincture of the
Philosophers. For what can there be in the whole range of medicine greater
than such purgation of the body, by means whereof all superfluity is radically
removed from it and transmuted? For when the seed is once made sound all
else is perfected. What avails the ill-founded purgation of the sophists
since it removes nothing as it ought? This, therefore, is the most excellent
foundation of a true physician, the regeneration of the nature, and the
restoration of youth. After this, the new essence itself drives out all
that is opposed to it. To effect this regeneration, the powers and virtues
of the Tincture of the Philosophers were miraculously discovered, and up
to this time have been used in secret and kept concealed by true Spagyrists.
