<p><br>
<blockquote>Of the illusions which amuse the childish mind of man, that
of Scientific Progress is not the least absurd. It is the most popular
toy in the nursery called Modern Civilization. The wisdom of yesterday
is the jest of today, the superstition of tomorrow. Human experience shows
this to be the case. Yet we go on believing we are making discoveries.
In the days of the Regency a physician looked upon a patient who refused
to be bled in much the same way that a modern practitioner regards an appendicitis
case who declines to have the inflamed fragment removed. Harley Street,
in 1923, assures us that old time surgery resulted in thousands of unnecessary
deaths from loss of blood. Harley Street, in 2023, will probably declare
that our present method resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths from
loss of the appendix. We believe we understand the phenomena of solar and
lunar eclipses, and believe that we have measured the distances from this
our earth to the visible planets. Five hundred years hence our calculations
will almost certainly be proved ridiculous. Nevertheless, we go on believing
we are making discoveries. A day must surely come when crowds shall throng
the waiting room of some consultant, famous for his having established
the efficacy of cupping; when all shall know that eclipses are not due
to the earth's shadow; when to common knowledge this same earth be stationary,
whilst stars, moon and sun revolve around it.
<p>What, then, do scientific discoverers discover? They discover (with
certain notable exceptions) new bottles to contain old physic. They exhibit
for our awe a tube of brick coloured powder, which they have named something
ending in "ium." It has always been, that brick coloured powder. An earlier
race, dwellers, perhaps, in a great Sun City now lost beneath an ocean,
used it to dye their beards. They proclaim radium. And one day, it may
be in some forgotten tomb, a practical radium lamp is found still alight.
They bear witness to the triumph of steel by erecting, in New York or elsewhere,
the worlds highest building; forgetting that somebody or another built
the Great Pyramid. They acclaim certain Japanese craftsmanship the finest
of its kind until among the treasures of a buried pharaoh yet finer examples
are unearthed. Signor Marconi can talk to his friends who are hundreds
of miles away. So could Apollonius of Tyana. The cinematogragh shows us
moving figures of those who have passed over. Any igh priest of Osiris
could have shown us the same; so could Moses. The churches assured the
world that we had emerged from the black ages of barbarism and were civilized.
Thereupon we plunged into the most savage and sanguinary war recorded in
the annals of man.
<p>What, then, is Evolution? That it is a slow process in the case of humanity,
experience would seem to show; but since Lord
<p>Rayleigh calculates the age of Mother Earth to be 925 million years,
the possibility of endless cycles suggests itself. That, by means of a
ceaseless chemical operation, the elements (which we are constantly and
confidently "discovering") become merged in forms variously known as coal,
diamonds, lead, gold, and a host of other commercial practicabilities,
would seem to be a Truth as opposed to a Theory. And since many natural
processes can be artificially reproduced, why not this wedding of atom
to atom?
<p>Professor Richardson, speaking of recent experiments relating to the
structure of the nucleus of atoms, declared the artificial transmutation
of chemical elements to be now an established fact. In short, it would
almost seem that we find ourselves upon the eve of "discovering" the Philosopher's
Stone of medieval alchemy. Professor Irving Fisher, of Yale, recently startled
the world by announcing that a German chemist had succeeded in making synthetic
gold from base metals by means of an electric vacuum furnace. Referring
to this alleged experiment, in an interview with a representative of the
"<i>Daily Mail</i>," Dr. Irvine Masson, of University College, London,
said: "So far no definite transmutation of an element by building up heavy
atoms of gold from lighter metals has been achieved. On the other hand,
Sir Ernest Rutherford has disintegrated certain of the lighter elements
into one still lighter. While one cannot say it is impossible, there seems
no reason why gold should be specially singled out by Nature to be the
ultimate product of a building-up or breaking-down process.
<p>"Supposing a certain amount of gold had been found to be a product of
change, the question would arise as to the utility of the process. At present
the only transmutation that has been affected has been, from the productive
point of view, extraordinarily ineffective and extravagant. I think that
most scientists are interested in these alleged discoveries, but are inclined
to be somewhat skeptical until definite proofs are forthcoming, which is
my position in the present case."
<p>But whatever the facts may be regarding this modern operation, the attitude
of leading scientists toward the possibilities of the German's vacuum furnace;
yet the author of the present work, whose researches into the subject of
Alchemy have been exhaustive, appears to have found good reason to believe
that some of these made synthetic gold! In the preface to his "<i>Alchemy,
Ancient and Modern</i>", Mr. Stanley Redgrave says: "The number of books
in the English language dealing with the interesting subject of Alchemy,
is not sufficiently great to render an apology necessary for adding thereto.
Indeed, at the present time, there is an actual need for a further contribution
on this subject."
<p>The present work is apparently written with a view to rectifying certain
misconceptions which are held by those who have criticized adversely the
claims of the old alchemists. This the author has sought to do by quoting
verbatim from the alchemystical writers themselves. That he has an extensive
library dealing with this subject, goes without saying; and of his deep
and wide personal inquiries mention has already been made.
<p>His style betrays a profound belief in alchemy or, as he terms it, "the
law of evolution as applicable to metals and minerals". In this he evidently
does not stand alone, as men eminent in science are to-day holding this
view as an hypothesis, and are making more than tentative experiments to
test it.
<p>The "Periodic Table of Mendeleeff" points in this direction, at least
as certainly as fossils do in the evolution of animal and vegetable life.
Sir Edward Thorpe and others have indicated definite numerical relations
between the members of the halogen group of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine,
and Iodine. Also in the case of the nitrogen group of Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
Arsenic, Antimony, and Bismuth. Apparently similar relations can be shown
to exist between the members of the following group: Lithium, Sodium, Copper,
Silver and Gold. "These numerical relations," says the author, "seem to
suggest affinity, even if they are far from proving it, and affinity suggests
at least a common parentage.
<p>"Some investigators would appear to find in their study of alchemy,
ground for putting forward an hypothesis that dogmas of religious belief
are the foundations on which alchemic writers have raised a bizarre temple
of chemistry. Further, that his chemistry was never practically achieved,
but only used symbolically to veil certain tenets of religion, such as
the trinity. However, considering the testimony on von Helmont and others,
which cannot be lightly set aside, and also the experiments of present-day
scientists, which far from disproving a law of evolution in metals, tend,
indeed, to affirm it, such an hypothesis seems inadequate to account for
the existence of alchemic literature."
<p>Chemistry has been styled "the wise daughter of a foolish mother", but
we see today that the daughter is investigating the maternal fairy tales
with the utmost caution, lest they should be found too true. World-wide
interests would be jeopardized by a discovery of the method of making gold
by synthesis; and it is really remarkable that more fiction has not been
written around this fascinating subject.
<p>A cipher manuscript, by Friar Bacon, is now being investigated in America
with a view to decoding it, and perhaps of getting at the truth of gold
evolution. One would imagine it to be almost certain, however, that Bacon
omits the names of his ingredients, or else supplies false names, as do
other writers. There are many ciphers in alchemic literature which have
been discovered such names as vitriolum, antimony, saturn (lead), stannum
(tin), etc. each of which is condemned as an ingredient by a consensus
of writers of repute. Doubtless, they are interpolated to distract the
attention of the student from the name of their "proxima materia", which
name they have mentioned openly and in the vulgar tongue.
<p>This name according to the author of the present work is given in order
to acquaint the alchemist's unknown brother adepts with the fact that he
knows the material; it is not written for the information of the tyro.
Thus, Sendivogius writes that he "intimated the art from word to word,"
but that his hearers "could by no means understand" him. Basil Valentine
named the substance openly. Eirenaeus Philalethes asserts that he could
tell true writers from sophisters "by a secret character." Therefore, he
must have found this word or character in the writers form whom he quotes.
It is, then, for others to find, but probably not in a cipher.
<p>Alchemy, at one time, was undoubtedly under the aegis of the Church.
The names of Flamel, Basil Valentine and Bernard Trevisan may be cited,
but without undue stress; in the cases of Bacon, Ripley and Lully, the
evidence is stronger. Ripley had the permission of the Church to withdraw
from his sacerdotal duties, in order to devote himself to alchemy. It is
impossible to conceive of the sanction of the Church being given if the
art were fraudulent in all instances. History places it on record that
certain alchemists were imprisoned by the sovereigns of states, not for
fraud, but for refusing to exercise their art or to impart its secret.
This seems to imply that success in the art had been proved beyond doubt.
<p>These hypotheses, and others which arise out of them, are extraordinarily
fascinating; but after all is said, remains the concrete fact that there
has been in the present day no accredited demonstration of the art perfected
the great work of transmuting baser metals into silver or gold. Nevertheless,
some of the foremost scientists of Europe and America are turning their
eyes in the direction of that star which beckoned to Raymond Lully. We
are possibly about to witness the phenomenon of the Philosopher's Stone,
"myth" of ancient superstition, emerging, tangible, from an electric vacuum
furnace! Who, now, shall deny the existence of fairies or doubt the birth
of the Gods?

<p><b><font size=+1>Section I</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Prefatory Remarks</font></b></center>

<p>This small treatise is intended to be a very brief re-statement of the
claims of the alchemists. It is set forth largely in their own words, and
principally from their view point; but the aspect from the standpoint of
recent scientific discoveries in the realm of physics, has not been overlooked.
Indeed, to have disregarded these latter, would have been tantamount to
neglecting the most trenchant arguments available, for making out an a
priori case in favour of the existence of a law or laws of evolution through
unity, applicable to all material things.
<p>As all branches of physics point in this direction, it is difficult
to say which method of investigation appears to yield the most striking
intimations, and presumptive evidence, of the evolution of metals. Probably
the spectroscope is foremost. Considerations of space, and of the scope
of this treatise, prevent further allusion to this fascinating subject
than is given in subsequent chapters. For him who proves the existence
of this evolutionary law by the production of gold, there is no guerdon
of fame; for results of publicity in this matter are truly incalculable.
<p>As regards the claims of the alchemists, these are twofold: first, that
a law of evolution obtains in the mineral and metallic realm; and second,
that its working has been practically demonstrated. Modern writers on chemistry,
and modern critics of alchemy, do not definitely deny the possibility of
evolution, but they do assert that the practical proof of the existence
of such a law has not yet passed successfully through the crucial test.
Yet the truth of the alchemists' assertions is vouched for in the most
solemn language possible. Without any obligation to do so, writers have
pledged their hopes of eternal salvation upon the truthfulness of their
statements. Some of the prayers of the alchemists are amongst the most
sublime outpourings of soul extant. I instance two only: Ripley's prayer
in the <i>Medulla of Alchemy</i>, commencing "O most incomprehensible Light,"
and Basil Valentine's preface to his <i>Last Will and Testament</i>. These
and the prayers and pious ejaculations of the other alchemists, <i>e.g.</i>,
Artephius, Flamel, Bacon, Geber, Kalid, Hermes are worthy to be preserved,
and to be made accessible to the ordinary reader. To assert that such men
are liars, or are deluded when they say they have evolved gold and silver,
is tantamount to admitting that one is ignorant of psychology. There is
no room for delusion or self deception, as there might be in witnessing
a conjuring trick.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>"O Lord God Almighty, merciful gracious Father of Thine Only Begotten
Son Jesus Christ, who art only the Lord of Sabaoth, the principle of all
things that are made by thy word, and definite end of all creatures above
and below; I, poor miserable man and earthworm, return thanks with my babbling
tounge from the innermost center of my heart, who hast been pleased to
enlighten me with the great light of Thy heavenly and earthly wisdom, and
the greatest mysteries of the created secrecies and treasures of this world,
together with Thy divine saving word, by which I learn to know Thine Almighty
power and wonders. To Thee belongs eternal praise, honour and glory, from
eternity unto eternity, that Thou hast bestowed on me health and livelihood,
strength and ability to be helpful to my fellow Christians in their necessities
and inflicted infirmities with these mystical healing medicines, together
with such spiritual comforts, to raise the drooping spirits. Lord, to Thee
alone belongs power, might and glory, to Thee is the praise, honour and
gratefulness, for all the mercies and graces Thou has bestowed upon me,
and hast preserved me therein to this my great age, and lowest comforts,
be not angry with me that I deliver up to Thee, mine eternal Creator, the
keys of my stewardship; wrapped up in this parchment, according to the
duty my calling and conscience calls for; with these Thou did suffer me
to keep house the most of my time till now, Thou hast called and foreseen
me to be thy servant and steward, and hast graciously afforded, that I
should enjoy the noble sweet fruits which were gathered in thy almonary
to my last instant, and which now O Lord lieth in Thy power. I beseech
Thee for the dear merits of Jesus Christ, come now, when Thou pleasest,
enclose my heart, receive my soul into Thy heavenly throne of grace; let
her be recommended unto Thee graciously O Thou faithful God, who hast redeemed
her on the Holy Cross with the most precious tincture of the true blood
of Thy holy body: then is my life well ended on this earth, grant to the
body a quiet rest, till at the last day, body and soul join again, and
are of a heavenly composition: for now my only desire is to be dissolved,
and to be with my Lord Christ: the which Thou, Almighty, Holy, and Heavenly
Trinity grant to me, and all good Christian believers. Amen."

<p><b><font size=+1>Prayer of Ripley in Medulla Alchemiae</font></b></center>

<p>"O most Incomprehensible Light, most glorious in majesty, who with the
clarity of Thy heavenly rays dost darken our dimmer light; O substantial
Unity, the Divine Three, the joy and rejoicing of the heavenly host, the
glory of our redemption. Thou most merciful, the purifier of souls, and
the perpetual subsistence, O most gracious, through daily dangers and perils
which Thou sufferest us to undergo, and through this vexatious veil of
vanity, bring us to Thy Heavenly Kingdom. "O power and wisdom, Thou goodness
inexplicable, uphold us daily, and be our guide and director, that we may
never displease thee all the days of our lives, but obey Thee as faithful
professors of Thy Holy name. Early, even betimes, O Lord, hear Thou my
prayers, by virtue of Thy grace help forward my desires, and enable me,
I beseech Thee, to perform Thy Holy Will. O most excellent fountain, boundless
in treasures, Thou scatterest Thy good things without measure amongst the
sons of men, and Thou makest every other creature to partake of Thine especial
kindness. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to behold the works of Thy hand and
to defend what Thy right hand hath planted, that we may not live unprofitably,
nor spend the course of our years in vanities. Grant, therefore, we beseech
Thee, that we may live without falsehood and deceit, that avoiding the
great danger of a sinful course of life, we may escape the snares of sin.
"And as I renounceth love of the things of this life, and the concupiscence
or lusts thereof, so accept of me, Thy servant, as a true and spontaneous
votary, who wholly depends on Thy goodness, with all confidence, possessing
nothing more. "We submit ourselves to Thee, for so it is fit; vouchsafe
Thy light to discover to us the immortal treasures of life; shew us Thy
hidden things, and be merciful and good unto us. "Among the rest of Thy
servants, who profess Thy name, I offer myself with all humble submission;
and I beseech Thee O Lord, to forgive me, if I open and reveal Thy secrets
to Thy faithful servants. Amen."
<p>These men declare that they have actually done the work themselves,
by their own hands; one exception to this being stated by the author of
The Book of Alze. It is simply a question of having produced ten fold,
a hundred fold, or a thousand fold more gold and silver than was used as
a ferment. A man who states definitely that he has accomplished this work
is telling the simple truth, or he is a conscious and self condemned liar.
He has had a certain result, and the theory he puts forward is intended
to account for this phenomenon through perfectly natural causes; and if
the material and working are correct the same result must inevitably follow.
<p>If he reads many alchemic books, the unbiased man will be unable to
avoid the conclusion that the alchemist had done that which he solemnly
asserted he had actually accomplished, <i>viz</i>., produced gold which
was not previously in existence. The whole possibility turns on this point;
"Is gold a compound body?" Chemists can only say that they have not yet
succeeded in splitting it up, if indeed such a statement is true. It could
also be said that it acts like a simple body. This latter is not a sufficient
argument, for many compounds take, for example, ethyl and ammonia act as
simple bodies to form bases, salts, amalgams, and so on. These compounds
were formerly considered to be simple.
<p>It has been stated that nitrogen, hitherto considered to be a simple
element has been split up into helium and hydrogen. The diamond has been
proved to consist of something more than crystallized carbon. Where analysis
has been accomplished, the possibility of synthesis has to be considered,
especially in "lifeless" things. Several books have been written suggesting,
and actually stating, that the art is impossible. Reduced to its simplest
terms, this means that these detractors have not accomplished the work,
and know of no one who has. The Periodic Law, if it points in any direction,
points in the direction of evolution. The evidence of the spectroscope
shows that the older a heavenly body is, the more "elements" it contains.
Our sun contains more elements than younger suns. The earth contains more
elements than the sun, although the former were thrown off from the sun,
and probably contained at that time precisely the same number as its parent
orb. The spectroscope fails to detect gold in nebulae, comet emanations,
or in any of the suns, including ours.
<p>Sir Roderick Murchison geologist and metallurgist said that gold was
"the latest formed metal." Nearly all, if not all, metallurgists and miners
agree that the occurrence of gold is mainly a surface phenomenon. There
is also the current belief that the: "tailings" of gold mines show more
gold, the longer they are left. These tailings are left by companies who
have efficient plant, including mercury, soda, cyanide, etc., for dissolving
out, or amalgamating with the gold; the tailings as a rule are worked over
by Chinamen using only the cradle and pan. Lock, on page 787 of his monumental
work entitled Gold, writes: "Many of the tailings cannot, by their position,
have been enriched gold sand descending to them by gravity, or by water
streams." Basil Valentine, in Chapter II of his <i>Last Will and Testament</i>,
also mentions the matter. Gold has not apparently ascended from the interior
of the earth, either as fluid, solid, or as volatilized into vapour. In
either case, the gold would be more abundant towards the interior. The
converse is true. Surface workings are the richest; and even the reefs
themselves get poorer as they get deeper. There are few exceptions to this
general rule.
<p>If Nature is still producing gold on the earth, she probably does so
in the form of minute specks. The nuggets are probably aggregations of
these specks deposited out of fluid in which they were suspended or carried
or in which they were in solution. It is unlikely that these atoms of gold
are formed by one dry metal acting on another; and it is said "One body
entereth not, or altereth not another". There must, it appears, be a medium,
a fluid medium of union. The author of <i>Aurea Catena Homeri</i> writes:
"A medium of union is wanting. They (the students) should look for such
a medium. One metal does not and cannot enter into a radical union with
another without their medium of union; this medium they have lost at the
melting furnace, near the mines. Go there and look for it, or take its
like". For those who work with common sulphur, mercury, salt, vitriol,
and antimony, he writes the following; "Many authors have written that
the vitriolic gur be the first matter of metals, others say that antimony
is the root and mother of the metals, this has caused much error". Also:
"That metals are reducible into sulphur, mercury and salt, I allow, but
that they should immediately proceed therefrom, I cannot find. I find no
running mercury in the mines near the metals; but will in cinnabar ore";
which latter fact is not strange, when one comes to think it over.
<p>The alchemists teach that the ordinary metals are not imperfect but
also impure; so here comes in a double work, <i>viz.</i>, removing impurities
an arduous task and then grading up to the gold standard. The substance
which they indicate as the material or subject, of the great philosophic
experiment is, they say, imperfect, immature, unripe, green, but not impure.
John Pontanus quoted with approval by others says: "He which separates
anything from the subject or matter, thinking it to be necessary (so to
do) wholly errs in his philosophy: That which is superfluous, unclean,
filthy, feculent, and in a word, the whole substance of the subject is
transmuted or changed into a perfect, fixed, and spiritual body, by the
help of our fire, which the wise men never revealed."
<p>In concluding the prefatory remarks, I should like to urge the necessity
of not according to comments the value, the same importance, as should
be attached to the text commented on. This applies to this treatise, and
to all manuscripts and edited books, in which the author gives his interpretation
of alchemic writers. The following are samples: Figulus, Kelly, Samuel
Norton, Arthur Dee, Petrus Bonus, W. Salmon, Yardley, De Winter, Backstrom,
and the volumes of <i>Collectanea Hermetica</i> ; these may suffice, though
the list could be extended considerably. It does not apply to the comments
of adepts upon adepts; but even these criticisms, strictures, or explanations,
should be carefully weighed.
<p>Every ancient faith or philosophy has been emasculated by friend and
foe alike; through the medium of comments, glosses, and biassed interpretations;
which have arrogantly assumed the authority which is inherent only in the
original text. In these brief sections is presented a consensus of opinions
extracted from ancient alchemic writings, in order to establish certain
facts, and to correct certain glaring misrepresentations. That the tract
might easily have swollen to an unmanageable size, will be known to those
who are aware that an enormous mass of literature is available, from which
to draw. As to the identity of the proxima and prima materiae, the writer's
own conclusions are not pertinent to the scope of this treatise ; they
are, therefore omitted. Neither is it useful to advise as to which books
are the best to study; for all do not gain knowledge from the same point
of view; as Eirenaeus remarks in his preface to <i>Ripley Revived</i>.
Pictorial presentations of the theory and practice of the art are invaluable,
such as those of Flamel, Maier, Basil Valentine and Splendor Solis (this
last recently issued by Kegan, Paul &amp; Co.).

<p><b><font size=+1>Modern Criticism</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In order that the statements of modern critics may be assessed at their
proper value, a list is here given of things which Ripley, endorsed by
Eirenaeus, says are useless, and even injurious in the work. Other eminent
alchemists, in their candid moments, warn students against using these
and many other ingredients.
<p>Antimony (not worth a mite), amalgams, acids, ardent and corrosive waters,
<b>arsenic,
orpiment</b>, blood, copper rust, copper vitriol, eggs, egg-shells, ferments,
hair, iron, steel, iron scales, crocifer, soul of lead, litharge, mercury
(quicksilver), vermillion, mercury sublimed, mercury precipitated, marchasite,
oils from calces, oil of lime, rubified imperfect bodies, spirits, sulphur,
sandiver, and these salts : ammoniac, alkali, alembroth, attincker, tartar,
common salt, gem, petre, soda, tinctures white and red, wine, vitriols
(<i>i.e</i>., sulphates, and other crystallized salts). The author of the
<i>Mystery
and Romance of Alchemy and Pharmacy</i> writes: " Men of undoubted ability
and genius wasted both their lives and their fortunes over the search for
this illusive chimera, etc." The use of the word "chimera" implies, of
course, that he does not believe that any of them did what they claimed
to have done. He prejudges the whole question from the standpoint of his
own attainments. So also, some say " there is no God " because they have
not found Him. He also says: "The notorious Dr. Dee is said to have received
immense sums of money from dupes for imparting the coveted secret, which
he demonstrated by means of an ingenious trick." He does not quote any
authority for so important a statement, nor explain even the nature of
the ingenious trick.
<p>Again: "Bacon states that sulphur and mercury are the mineral roots
and natural principles upon which Nature herself acts and works in the
mines and caverns of the earth; the latter metal he believed to be the
true elixir of the philosopher's stone." This is not a true presentment
of Bacon's sayings. Bacon did not believe and did not write that the metal
mercury was an ingredient. He says: "The first work is the reducing the
Body into Water, that is into Mercury." And: "Our tincture then, is only
generated out of the mercury of the wise...&nbsp; because from this Mercury
alone, is the Virtue and Power of this our Magistery: and it so resolves
every (Metalline) Body, that it may be augmented or multiplied... The second
principle of our Stone is called Mercury." Notice the Body is not dissolved
in Mercury, there is no amalgam; but resolved, as others say, into a clear
water, called by them Mercury. This modern author also says: "...others,
including Rhazes and Merlin, believed it to be an amalgam of gold and mercury,
fantastically called the Red man and his White wife." It is difficult to
understand how many reading of alchemic treatises save of the most superficial
kind, can give rise to such an interpretation. Just as their sulphur was
not brimstone, for it was incombustible (see Geber, Sendivogius, etc.),
so their mercury was neither hydrargyrum nor any of its salts. (See Ripley's
"<i>Erroneous Experiments</i>") True, the Red Man is gold but the Mercury,
which is the White Wife, was a substance compounded by art, therefore,
not mercury. Eirenaeus on Ripley: "The next secret is to know our Mercury,
which is not common, but artificial, drawn from three heads by the mediation
of one thing," etc. He makes the same misinterpretation of the alchemic
writers; since they agree that common sulphur is not meant, and not used.
Extracts from authors on this point will be given later. "<i>The Story
of Alchemy</i>" embodies several errors which are perpetuated by other
authors, and it is the importance of these errors, and not of the work,
which necessitates somewhat extended notice here. As regards the <i>Story
of Alchemy</i>, the impression left on the mind by reading it is that the
author thinks there may be something in it after all. He mentions that
where gold is, silver is found (and he might have added iron), also that
all lead contains some silver. But why? It was from hints less evident
than this that Wallace and Darwin developed the theory of evolution. The
author says: "...the one experiment which seems to us to be the crucial
experiment of the system, was never accomplished." But surely he cannot
expect, for his positive assertion of a negative, a credence he himself
denies to others who state the contrary. Indeed, the author of that highly
esteemed tract, entitled <i>The Hermetic Art</i>, himself writes: "It is
not lawful, nor commendable to reprobate an art, by judges who are ignorant
of its laws as well as the facts; and the ignorant negative of such, is
by no means sufficient to set aside the affirmative knowledge of so many
men of unquestionable credit, piety and virtue, supported by arguments
and circumstances of incontestable force."
<p>These men asserted not merely a theory, but that they had accomplished
the work with their own hands, and had done so more than once. I will instance
Flamel, Eiranaeus Philalethes, and Basil Valentine. The latter, amongst
many other things, discovered fulminating gold: this, the modern chemist
believes, because he knows it exists, and knows how to prepare it. But
he discredits Basil Valentine's assertion that he has made gold; he believes
it cannot be made, because it has not come within his own knowledge or
experience. And only on those grounds, for he cannot affirm that it is
scientifically impossible or incredible. It is necessary to lodge an emphatic
protest against the unfairness, the scarcely veiled contempt, that pervades
the criticism of the claims of the alchemists. The criticism professes
to be an impartial and scientific investigation of the theory of the existence
of a law of evolution. It is neither impartial nor scientific.
<p>The author of <i>The Story of Alchemy</i> cites the parable of Mercury
and the Alchemist out of Sendivogious, and says: "Sometimes the patient
rebelled." Our author does not say why this common mercury rebelled, yet
Sendivogious mentions the reason. It is because hydrargyrum is the wrong
"mercury" altogether, and could not accomplish the things the pseudo-alchemist
required of it. This central fact could not be missed by the most careless
reader. "Of what wilt thou make the Philosopher's Stone?" Alchemist: "Of
Mercury , sir." Senex: "Oh what Mercury?" Alchemist: "There is but one
Mercury." Senex: "It is true, there is but one Mercury, but altered variously,
according to the variety of places; one is purer than another." Alchemist:
O, sir, I know how to purify it very well with vinegar and salt, with nitre
and vitriol." Senex: "I tell thee this is not the true purifying of it,
neither is this, thus purified, the true Mercury: wise men have another
Mercury, and another manner of purifying it."
<p>Again, Alchemist: "Do tell me if thou art the true Mercury, or if there
be another." Mercury: "I am Mercury, but there is another." And so on,
all through the parable. The modern author says: "Those who pretended to
know, abused and vilified those who differed from them." The word "pretended"
abuses and vilifies those who solemnly swore that they had done the work;
it also begs the whole question. He quotes Madathanas in support of his
statement, omitting, however, to quote the following pregnant sentence
by the same author. "To the Most High and Almighty God, the Creator of
this Art, Whom it hath pleased to reveal to me, wretched, sinful man (in
answer to my prayer), this most precious knowledge, be eternal praise,
glory, honour, and thanksgiving." This alters the standpoint to that of
an honest man who is indignant with those who defraud others by false methods,
knowing them to be false and futile. In the same partial manner he quotes
<i>The
Only True Way</i> and omits this sentence: "I myself may not speak out
as plainly as I would, for I am silenced by the vow, which binds all the
masters of the Art." One does not need to be an expert in economics to
visualize what would happen if a recipe were given "making this art as
common as the baking of bread, or the brewing of beer."
<p>On page 96 : Op. cit. the author writes: "The story quoted in chap.
III., from Michael Sendivogious, illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists
themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term "Mercury";
yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that. Some of
them evidently took it to mean the substance then, and now called mercury;
the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous; others thought
of mercury as a substance which could be obtained, or, at any rate, might
be obtained, by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury, both alone and
when mixed with other substances, etc." Here, again, he makes no distinction
between alchemists who had, or might have, done the work, and who, therefore,
knew perfectly well what "their mercury" was, and those who were groping
after the hidden meaning of these adepts. He mentions that Basil Valentine
wrote the "Dedicatory Epistle" to the <i>Triumphal Chariot of Antimony</i>.
Surely this is written by his commentator Theodore Kerckringius; it is
exactly his style, as used in his address "to the Reader" and in the comments
throughout the work. Furthermore, these words occur in the Dedicatory Epistle:
"Since in the words of Basilius, I have already gained a place in a higher
class."
<p>The author of the <i>Story of Alchemy</i> also says: "The yellow lion
was the alchemical symbol of yellow sulphides, the red lion was synonymous
with cinnabar, and the green lion meant salts of iron and of copper." Ripley
must have heard, or read, similar remarks nearly 500 years ago, for he
says in his <i>Erroneous Experiments</i>: "Also I wrought in Sulphur and
in Vitriol, which fools do call the Green Lion." Also in Ripley's "<i>Sixth
Gate</i>":
<p>"The said Menstrua is (I say to thee in counsel) The blood of our Green
Lion, and not of Vitriol."
<p>Ripley, in his <i>Medulla Alchimiae</i>, contrasts these two Green Lions.
All these lions are one in nature though two in substance; the Green is
a very immature or unripe thing, the Yellow is a more matured state of
"our Unripe Gold," the Red Lion is the perfect state, sometimes applied
to the philosopher's red stone, but more usually to ordinary gold. Neither
of these lions contained common sulphur, nor common mercury, nor any of
their derivatives. Neither Hg nor S entered into the composition of the
Great Stone, as is shown later on. Again: "Black sulphides were called
eagles, and sometimes crows." I cannot find it so in my reading. "When
black sulphide of mercury is strongly heated, a red sublimate is obtained,
which has the same composition as the black compound; if the temperature
is not kept very high, but little of the red sulphide is produced; the
alchemist is directed to urge the fire, "else the black crows will go back
to the nest."
<p>The application of the production of these sulphides of mercury to the
process of the sages is hopelessly wrong. First, they used no mercury and
could, therefore, produce no sulphide of mercury; second, they used no
sulphur; so, it being absent, could not combine with the mercury which
was not present. Thirdly, the essential colours were not black then red:
the black itself was soft, bubbling, plastic substance. The colours are
black, azure, blue, iridescent, then white.
<p><i>Scala Philosophorum</i> says: "The sign of the first perfect whiteness
is the manifestation of a certain little circle, as of hair that is passing
over the head, which will appear on the sides of the vessels round about
the matter in a kind of citrine or yellowish colour." This ends in perfect
silvery whiteness. This is the White Stone; it is "fermented" with an "oily
calx of silver" to produce the elixir which transmutes metals (chiefly
copper and iron) into pure silver. The White Stone can, without opening
the glass, be rubified by a higher degree of heat into the Red Stone. The
attentive student also knows that the crow never evoluted into a scarlet
bird direct, but first into a dove, or swan. So in the account of the Noachian
deluge, the dove comes into the story after the raven had disappeared.
And later we get the account of the red wine of Noah's vineyard. There
are two ways of viewing <i>The Story Of Alchemy</i>; either the author
has not succeeded in deciphering the code which the alchemists used to
notify their discovery to each other; or he has. In the latter case, it
may have seemed good to him to discourage belief in metallic evolution;
or in the alternative, to suggest to inquirers the wrong material, in order
that the foundations of society might not be upheaved.
<p>The nearer an investigator approaches the heart of the mystery, the
more cautious he becomes in his public utterances, for the reasons I have
stated.
<p>In <i>Alchemy, Ancient and Modern</i>, by H. Stanley Redgrove, are the
following brief and pregnant sentences: "What would be the result if gold
could be cheaply produced?" "...the financial chaos which would follow,
if it were to be cheaply obtained, surpasses the ordinary imagination."
The above named book, issued originally in 1911, is written in the spirit
of investigation, and should be studied. So much has been discovered lately
in the realm of physics, that we are justified in presuming that not every
writer on this tremendous subject, and who employs an obscure style, is
necessarily merely posing as a mystigogue; or because his innate and inordinate
vanity fears exposure. The unbiased student must, I think, conclude that
these men discovered this evolutionary law: that they were ages in advance
of their times, and are still in advance of ours. When we consider the
paucity of their resources we must conclude, also, that their materials
were common and cheap, and their method, from a view, simple. All their
would-be imitators have been far too subtle and elaborate.
<p><i>A History of Chemistry</i>, by the late J. Campbell Brown, embracing
the subject of alchemy, requires rather an extended review. A few extracts
given before entering on the review may assist the reader to judge whether
this author's opinion is biased, or scientifically critical.
<p>Speaking of Raymond Lully, he writes (p.97): "The story goes that he
was employed by Edward I. of England to make gold for minting, and that
he had a laboratory for this purpose at Westminster; but analysis of the
coins of that king does not bear out the tale, for they are found to be
pure gold, not gold of the philosophers." P.138: "Of course, when we read
that Paracelsus said that he possessed a portion of this mystic substance,
and he actually transmuted base metals into gold, we feel sure that he
was simply telling a lie. Or when we read that Raymund Lully was presented
to Edward I. by the abbot of Westminster, and that he made gold for the
king from base metals which gold was used for making coins: and when by
assays we discover that surviving specimens of these coins are composed
of genuine gold, we assume that either King Edward or Raymund Lully was
deceived at some point of the process. In a later century, Henry VI. of
England and Charles VII. of France coined a quantity of gold made by the
Philosopher's Stone, but that gold was undoubtedly spurious."
<p>P.201, on Van Helmont: "He asserted that he had actually witnessed the
transmutation of a base metal into gold, a remarkable statement from a
man of his lofty character and shrewd powers of observation, which has
led some to think that the adepts may have approached nearer to the Magnum
Opus than is usually supposed". Of Edward Kelly, he writes: "He seems to
have been an accomplished liar."
<p>Touching on these points briefly, he asserts that gold coins of Edward
I. are good gold, and therefore not produced by alchemic art; and conversely,
the gold coinage of Henry VI of England, and Charles VII of France, was
debased, therefore, presumably, alchemy may have had a hand in producing
it... We assume that either King Edward or Raymund Lully was deceived at
some point of the process". The author seems to assume that this was a
chemical experiment; but evidently it was an ordinary commercial issue,
and had it not been profitable, the gold would have been purposely debased
to make it so. Lully did not strike the coins, he only handed over gold
to the king's coiners. A happy deception, truly, where pure gold results,
and everyone is perfectly satisfied.
<p>With regard to the episode of Henry VI., there is no evidence as to
the kind of gold handed to the official minters; but there is abundant
reason supplied by the disastrous events of that reign, for the necessity
of a debased coinage for internal circulation. State paper money at 100
per cent. profit was not then known. The debasing of coin was known and
practiced in every state at some period of its history, and this quite
apart from alchemy : the critic is therefore hard pressed for his argument
and illustration to drag in Henry VI of England and Charles VII of France,
and on the same page to discredit, by a sudden volte-face the account of
Edward I.
<p>His statement concerning Van Helmont is distorted; the latter did not
merely "witness" a transmutation; here is the account according to Helmont:
"I had once given me the fourth part of a grain --- I call a grain that
which takes 600 to make an ounce. I made projection therewith, wrapped
in paper, upon eight ounces of quicksilver, having made a little noise,
stopped and congealed into a yellow mass. Having melted it in a strong
fire, I found within eleven grains of eight ounces of most pure gold, so
that a grain of this powder would have transmuted into very good gold,
19,156 grains of quicksilver."
<p>Helvetius, also asserts that with a fragment of the philosopher's stone
about the size of half a turnip seed, he transmuted half an ounce of lead
(and some silver) into six drams and two scruples of most pure gold. This
transmutation was done by himself and his wife, at home, in his own crucible,
on lead cut off by himself, and the adept who gave him the elixir was not
present. This episode is not mentioned apparently in <i>The History of
Chemistry</i>.
<p>Neither does he record the demonstrations of Dr. Price, of Guildford,
in May, 1782. These eight or nine consecutive transmutations were done
in the presence of several witnesses, with all the precautions the latter
could devise. They are given in full detail in The Annual Register for
the year 1782, published in London, 1783. It is difficult to imagine that
the learned author of <i>The History of Chemistry</i> had not read the
accounts of Helvetius and Dr. Price.
<p>On page 2, the author cited, writes : "The professors of that art (alchemy)...
engaged themselves in a search for what was by them unattainable". Here
the accent seems necessarily to fall upon the words "by them"; he does
not commit himself here to the statement that the art is impossible per
se.
<p>On page 5, the following occurs : "...two philosophical follies of the
schoolman, the search for the philosopher's stone, and for the elixir of
life."
<p>Page 10. "The Chaldean Nebo corresponds with the metal mercury and the
planet mercury." And on page 12: 'From the Chaldeans alchemy passed to
the Egyptians," and, "Although quicksilver played an important part in
alchemy, the ancient Egyptians were not acquainted with it, as it was not
discovered till a much later date." In ancient Chaldean astronomy, Nebo
may have been ascribed to the planet Mercury, but how it could correspond
to a metal of which there is no mention until about 300 BC, the author
does not attempt to explain. In Chapter V., it will be found that such
ascription was made about the fifth century.
<p>Page 9, he remarks that "there were no mines and little fuel in Chaldea,
and so this knowledge and skill must have been slowly acquired by some
other nation domiciled in a metalliferous and fuel-growing country." The
alchemists assert positively that no metal is an ingredient of the work
(with the exception of gold or silver with which to "ferment" the elaborated
"white stone"), therefore, presumably, the art of alchemy could be practiced
in countries deficient in metals, so long as the necessary apparatus was
obtainable.
<p>As we know that the ancient Chaldeans and Egyptians were proficient
in making vessels of glass and earthenware, we also may assume that they
could and did make the laboratory apparatus they required, including crucibles.
The modern critic holding --- or pretending to hold --- that the sophistication
and adulteration of gold and silver constituted the art of alchemy, requires
the presence of metalliferous loads.The alchemist required the absence
--- by all the tests known to him --- of every kind of metal, including
gold and silver and mercury. Therefore, the entire superstructure of criticism
collapses, being theoretically built upon a nonexistent foundation.
<p>As in the case of mercury and other metals so also is it in the case
of sulphur. This, and other substances such as arsenic, bismuth, and salts
are in alchemy analogous to the false gods set up in the Egyptian temples,
where in very ancient times an apparently pure monotheism existed. (P.16
op. cit.).
<p>On page 21, and elsewhere, "theiou apyrou" is translated as "unburnt
sulphur," and therefore the distillate is called "sulphur-water." The correct
translation of "a-pyrous" is "unchanged by fire"; this not only totally
negatives ordinary sulphur, but also corresponds to that which the alchemists
have named, in the tongues of Chaldea, Egypt, Arabia, Greece, and Rome,
"sulphur incombustible." The apparatus depicted is also unsuitable for
distilling sulphur, or for collecting any sulphur gases.
<p>The true "sulphur" which was incombustible in the fire, "and valued
not its martyrdom at all," has its analogy in the bush which Moses saw,
which burned in the fire, but was not consumed, and in the Hebrew youths
who were cast in the fiery furnace, over whom "the fire had no power. .
.nor had the smell of fire passed on them." Following logically on the
assumption of manipulation of sulphur, the author, on page 24, identifies
the deleterious gas which issues as sulphuretted hydrogen, but he thereby
proves that his sulphur was not "unchanged by fire."
<p>On page 33 he quotes : "This is the definition of the stone which is
not a stone, nor of the nature of a stone. It is a stone which is engendered
every year. Its mine is found on the summit of the mountains. It is a mineral
contained in sand and in rocks of all hills; it is found also in colouring
matters, in the sea, in trees, in plants, in waters, etc. As soon as you
have recognised it, take it and make a calx of it." (In other words, calcine
it and reduce it to an oxide.) "Extract its soul, body, and spirit, separate
each of these things, and place it in the special vase which is set apart
for it. Mix the colours, as painters do for black, white, yellow and red,
and as doctors do in their mixtures, where enter the moist and the dry,
the warm and the cold, the soft and the hard, in such a way as to obtain
a well-balanced mixture, favorable to bodies. This done by the aid of determined
weights. Then are united in one their diverse qualities."
<p>This well-known extract is endorsed by other alchemists; but our modern
critics do not attempt to explain how either common sulphur, or any one
of the ingredients they mention, fulfills, or can fulfill the conditions
here set out. On pages 86, 87 and elsewhere, the statement is made that
copper is the basis of much of the work detailed in <i>Chrysopoeia, Argyropoeia</i>
and the <i>Turba</i>. If this were literally true, they would not be alchemic
treatises.
<p>This extract is given from Parmenides in the <i>Turba</i> (Lond., 1896),
pages 33, 34 : "Leave, therefore, manifold and superfluous things, and
take quicksilver, coagulate in the body of magnesia, in kuhul or in the
sulphur which does not burn ; make the same nature white, and place it
upon our copper when it becomes white. And if ye cook still more it becomes
red, when if ye proceed to coction, it becomes gold, etc."
<p>In the <i>History of Chemistry</i> it is given thus, the contents of
the brackets being our author's interpretation or interpolation: "Take
quicksilver; coagulate it with the body of magnesia (meaning magnetite,
sulphide of antimony, sulphide of lead, sulphide of tin, or pyrites), or
with kuhul (<i>i.e</i>., sulphide of antimony) or unburnt sulphur, render
its nature white and put it in upon our copper, and it will whiten the
copper. If you render the mercury red, the copper will redden, and if one
then heats, it will become gold, etc." (Note: the ore magnetite mentioned
by our author happens to be singularly free of sulphur.)
<p>Taking the points seriatim : "Leave, therefore, manifold and superfluous
things," i.e., there is no need for extraneous things, for the "mercury,"
the "magnesia," and the dark "copper" are but separated parts of the One
thing, now purified, and about to be reunited, and not three alien things.
This is emphasized by many Masters, and even in the <i>Turba</i> it is
said by Lucas (page 41) : "For ye need not a number of things, but one
thing only, which in each and every grade of your work is changed into
another nature."
<p>"Take quicksilver", <i>i.e</i>., the volatile "mercury" which has been
distilled from the body. "Coagulate in the body of magnesia," <i>i.e</i>.,
in the white salt, the philosophic sal ammoniac which has also come up
and separated itself from the dark body (kuhul or philosophic antimony,
or black lead). In both works the dark body is whitened, but particularly
in the sealed glass; and it is this latter work which is here intended.
<p>"And if ye cook still more it becomes red. In the <i>History of Chemistry</i>
version the translation ran thus : "If you render the mercury red, the
copper will redden, etc." --- to the modern author this must seem curious,
for first the red copper is made white, and then its redness is restored
to it, by two very elaborate procedures with some one or two, or more of
the things he mentions. But with the philosophic base which they call Venus
or copper, it is not incongruous, for their copper is not red after the
"mercury" and the "magnesia" have been separated from it, but dark or obscure.
<p>At the risk of irksome reiteration it is necessary to affirm that competent
alchemists were aware of the presence of "combustible feculent sulphur"
in sulphide ores such as sulphide of antimony, sulphide of lead, sulphide
of tin, and pyrites; also in the sulphurets, sulphites, and the sulphate
salts, and condemned them on that account, not merely as useless, but as
prejudicial to the art. They apparently regarded sulphur or brimstone as
a waste by-product, in the evolutionary process. See Sendivogius' <i>Treatise
on Sulphur</i>, and his <i>Parable</i>.
<p>Most of the extracts quoted in the <i>History of Chemistry</i>, are
of little importance, and have no authoritative value, being by unknown
authors, and the attempted interpretation of any quotation is unconvincing.
Very few extracts are given from the writings of men held by consent to
be adepts ; and these few are quoted with insufficient reference to the
context, and no reference at all to any statements by their authors or
others, which qualify the surface meaning of such extracts.
<p>The same suggestion of bias is shown in varying proportions in the other
critical books reviewed in this section. For instance, the <i>Story of
Alchemy</i> in Chapter VI, suggests that the idea of alchemy and transmutation
may have arisen in a manner something like this : --- A steel knife blade
is immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, and on withdrawing it,
it is found to be coated with a deposit of copper. [See also Sir Edward
Thorpe's "<i>History of Chemistry</i>" Vol. I, p.34. Watts &amp; Co., 1921.]
"What more simple than to conclude that the iron has been transformed into
copper?" Also, apparently, we may assume that when the knife blade was
dipped in a saturated solution of salt, and was removed with a deposit
of salt upon it, the very simple alchemist, who was an expert worker in
metals, precious stones, glass, pottery, etc., would be overjoyed at the
discovery of an instance of evolutionary law transmuting iron into an alkaline
salt. According to Roscoe a knowledge of the properties of iron vitriol
can be traced at least as far back as Geber ; but in what dim ages antedating
Egypt, or the Aztecs, the knowledge of copper salts began, we have in the
History of Chemistry men acute and clever, in silvering, gilding, depositing
one metal on another, and in the mixing of metals in fusion.
<p>These two eminent authors do not agree as to whether the alchemists
were most noted for skilled cunning or credulous simplicity. They both
commit the fundamental and very elementary mistake of taking alchemic names
of materials literally, though protesting that they do not. For example,
on page 186, op. cit.: "Gold, silver and mercury constitute the material
of the stone, after they have been prepared by art." The following lines,
and page 187, prove that these names are constructed literally.
<p>On pages 187, 188 are the following: "To speak plainly, the materials
for the work were gold trichloride, silver nitrate, and mercury bichloride.
This mixture was enclosed in a glass matrass called the Philosopher's egg,
which was hermetically sealed by fusion of the neck." Here, then, there
is no sulphur ; moreover, it is not apparently possible that such a mixture
could become by turns black, iridescent, white, and lastly a permanent
red. As mentioned elsewhere, the alchemists especially and specifically
condemn a mixture of gold and silver "lest a monstrous lineage be begotten."
<p>"...the alchemists seem to have employed an oil lamp with a wick composed
of amianth or flexible asbestos". Nothing could be further from the truth.
Basil Valentine has said : "Our fire is a common fire, and our furnace
is a common furnace." "Let no prattling sophister lead you into error with
many furnaces. As our furnace is common, so is our fire common." Urbigerus
in Aphorism 72 says: "... we have our self alone without the help of any
creature living prepared them all on a common kitchen fire, as is very
well known to several co-adepts our friends, who could not but admire and
approve our industry." Apart from these statements is the fact that a sufficiently
fierce heat could not be obtained for the final stage, by means of an oil
lamp. The modern critics are vitally at variance with each other, and none
touches the hem of the mystery.
<p>The alchemist prepared gold chloride in order to get gold oxide; or,
according to Roscoe, to obtain gold in a final state of division. It is
one of these latter --- and not the trichloride --- which they used in
preparing the ferment. As regards the silver nitrate , the alchemists definitely
and by name condemn the dissolving of silver in aq. fortis (or nitric acid),
alleging that this is not a true philosophic solution, but rather a process
which destroys the "radical humidity," and is comparable rather to melting
by fire than to a natural process. The acid, if used at all, was used (as
aq. regia was employed for gold) to enable them to get the silver oxide,
or silver in a fine state of division.
<p>As regards corrosive sublimate, no mercury, or salt of mercury went
into the philosopher's egg. The modern author's remarks tempt one to diverge
very widely from the scope of this book, but limits of space prevent; it
must suffice to draw attention to the fact --- the very suggestive fact
--- that none of these modern critics, be he humorous, sarcastic, or more
condescendingly pitiful than angry, attempts to prove that metallic evolution
is even probably impossible, having regard to chemical laws as now stated
or accepted.
<p><i>The History of Chemistry</i> states a well-known fact that this art
came to Western Europe from Egypt, through the Arabs and Moors. As is stated
above: "Although quicksilver played an important part in alchemy, the ancient
Egyptians were not acquainted with it, as it was not discovered till a
much later date." This being so, it follows that the "Mercury" used in
Egypt before hydrargyrum and its salts were known, is the same "Mercury"
mentioned by all alchemists, both previous to and subsequent to the period
of Egyptian alchemy.
<p>I append this pertinent extract from <i>Hydropyrographum Hermeticum:</i>
"Moreover, the philosophers do say that there is no coming to a good end
until gold and silver be joined together in one body. Here, my son, thou
must understand Luna metaphorically, and not according to the letter...
by Luna is understood mercury or the prime matter... and not mercury vive,
as the sophisters suppose. For the first matter of metals is not mercury
vive. I tell thee, my son, unless the body of Sol be sowed in its proper
soil, your labour is in vain, and it produceth no fruit." This agrees with
the sayings of the Masters; consequently, neither gold nor mercury is in
the sealed glass with the red stone; using these names of materials in
their everyday sense. A quotation from Bernard Trevisan's <i>Epistle to
Thomas of Bononia</i> "in which," writes Eirenaeus, "let me seriously profess
I received the main light in this hidden secret" here follows. It deals
with metalline salts, such as nitrate of silver, chloride of gold, and
others: "For example, fools draw corrosive water out of inferior minerals,
into which they cast the species of metals and corrode them. For they think
that they are therefore dissolved with a natural solution, which solution
truly requires a permanency of the dissolver and dissolved together, that
a new species might result from both the masculine and feminine seed. Yet
thus they think they dissolve (mistaking Nature) but dissolve not; for
the aqua fortis being extracted, the body becometh meltable as before,
and that water abides not with nor subsists in the body as its radical
moisture. The bodies indeed are corroded, they are so much more estranged
from a metallic kind. These solutions, therefore, are not the foundation
of the Art of Transmutation but the impostures rather of sophistical alchymists
who think that this sacred Art is hid in them." He adds that another sophistic
solution is that of melting by the force of fire. The third and philosophical
solution is by the mixture of their mercury with the sulphur (from which
it, the mercury, had been previously separated) so that these two purified
and re-conjoined parts might corrupt and putrefy together-as in the analogy
of a grain of corn in the earth --- and producing a living, growing thing.

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In order to understand the alchemic writer, it is necessary to follow
his mental processes, to enter into the same mental view. It would be an
easy task for him to name his two ingredients, and to describe, step by
step, what he does with them. But such a revelation would inevitably result
in national and international chaos.
<p>The alchemist wishes to make himself known to the unknown brethren,
who have also done the work. He craves the society of those with whom he
can converse freely of these wonderful things; those with whom he can reside,
and travel, without a continual restraint upon his words and actions. On
this aspect, read the 13th Chapter of <i>An Open Entrance to the Closed
Palace of the King</i>, by Eirenaeus Philalethes; and <i>Lives of the Alchemystical
Philosophers</i>, by A.E. Waite; Thomas Norton's account of Thomas Daulton's
experiences, in the <i>Ordinal of Alchemy</i>, and also the account of
the persecution and death of the adept who was the master of Sendivogius.
<p>The alchemists who, like Ripley and Valentine, already had a safe and
chosen retreats in their monasteries, desired yet to leave on record their
testimony that the art was true, and not "a cunningly devised fable." The
ancient manuscripts were rare, and these later men were able, by the intervention
of printing, to make known in their books, vital excerpts from these unobtainable
manuscripts. It is obvious that the alchemist dared not openly name his
materials in the practical part of his book: neither did he describe in
detail his handling of these materials. These important points he apparently
hinted at in a very circuitous way in his theory or philosophy; and where
for all I know to the contrary, he may have remedied the omission for those
who have patience and intuition.
<p>The speech of the philosopher is not ignorant in the matter of which
he is treating, for he is a Master. But he displays ignorance of the true
explanation of the phenomena of nature. These he is using as figures of
speech, as analogies, and as presumed parallelism; therefore, as proofs.
<p>The alchemic writer has a very difficult task: he wishes to testify
to a process, very difficult to be explained; that is --- as to why it
happens. To explain the laboratory work was easy, for the work was easy;
but to explain why, according to the then accepted topsy-turvy explanation
of natural phenomena, was not mere difficulty, it was sheer impossibility.
But he did his best according to his ability; none can do more, and many
of us do less.
<p>The alchemist had been taught by the scientific dicta of his day to
believe in the spontaneous generation of insects, flies, worms, snakes,
and even higher forms of life, and in the evolution of barnacle geese from
bi-valves. Also, that sea currents flowed up to the north pole by the magnetic
attraction of the arctic pole, entered there, traversed the "Axle-tree
of the world," and emerged at the south pole. They used these supposed
facts to illustrate, and even as proof of, their art. But, however impatient
this may make us, it should not lead us to conclude that the whole art
is as untrue as the attempted proof. The attempted proof, though convincing,
would not have proved the art true, neither does its failure prove the
art false.
<p>Many a modern man would make a hash of trying to prove the right angled
triangle theorem, but his failure does not disprove it. For ages men tried
to account for the apparent motion of the sun, planets and stars; their
explanation was wrong. For years chemists explained the behavior of oxygen
by the phlogiston theory; they also were wrong. But the earth still revolved
on its axis, and travelled in its path around the sun; oxygen still continued
its manifestations.
<p>The discovery of evolution as applied to plants and animals, was of
the last generation; in the next generation it may be found to apply to
minerals and metals; if, indeed, it be not already as well known as it
is suspected. It is, therefore, abundantly obvious that a wrong explanation
of an occurrence does not affect the occurrence. Much less do these wrong
explanations of phenomenon x. affect the truth of phenomenon y. being only
used as analogies, or parallel illustrations. We have daily evidence of
this, when children give most weird explanations of things which have come
under their notice. The same type of error is observed when an aboriginal
native or an inexperienced kitten, sees its reflection in a mirror for
the first time.
<p>But the wrong explanation does not make us pooh-pooh the occurrence.
Quite the contrary, indeed, the very earnestness of the child convinces
us that something has happened. Similarly, I think, we should hold it not
only as unfair, but also unscientific to dismiss as an "illusive chimera"
this art, merely on the grounds of the falsity of the supposed analogic
illustrations advanced as proofs.
<p><i>The History of Chemistry</i> is crammed full of blunders in nomenclature,
action, re-action and composition; but the substances have not been "scrapped"
or condemned on that account; they have been investigated, analyzed, and
re-named.
<p>As the ancient chemists were ignorant of natural law outside their laboratory,
so to-day a botanist of world-wide fame may be ignorant of mathematics;
a theologian, of medicine; and so on. We do not, therefore, deride them
as inefficient in their own special life's work. Here also are men who
lived and worked, and discovered elements and compounds, who testified
--- centuries before Darwin --- that a law of evolution exists in the mineral
realm, and that they had proved it practically.
<p>In nature it often happens that the obvious is false and the concealed
is true. So it is in the speech of the philosophers; and many have discovered
this. In their presentment of the method of Practice. Here the verbal surface
which conceals their "snowy splendour" is "blacker than black."
<p>It would, indeed, in some respects, be easier to follow their methods,
if blank spaces, or mere letters of the alphabet, or numerals, were substituted
for most of the names given. The student would then --- instead of wasting
his thought, time, and means on the wrongly named materials --- be compelled
to guide himself by the properties of the things. As matters are he probably
works on things which, though indicated, or even named, by alchemic writers,
could not possibly accomplish the work, because they are not in the true
evolutionary path to silver and gold.
<p>The following points should be considered.---1.The place where the substance
is found. 2. Whether liquid or solid. 3. How treated. 4. Any change when
heated. 5. Its action in contact with other bodies. 6. Does it evaporate?
8. Is it easily distilled or with difficulty, and great heat? 9. Its scent
or taste. 10. Its ordinary outward appearance. 11. Is it acid or alkaline?
12. On mixture does it evolve heat, or produce cold? 13. If a fluid, does
it swim on, mix with, or sink in other fluids? These and other signs will
aid in determining whether or not the worker has succeeded in "spotting"
the materials used by the alchemist. All this is very elementary; but apparently
students usually rush at the thing which the writer has called antimonyfor
instance --- and try to force from it the signs and reactions described.
If much more thought were used, before the actual practice began, these
blunders would be less frequent.
<p>It does not appear to be necessary to discuss the intangible "elements,"
earth, air, fire and water; they are exhaustively treated of in ancient
and modern books on alchemy. As regards the three "principles." mercury,
sulphur, and salt, I gather that they are definite entities, cognizable
by our senses, and capable of being investigated by the process of modern
chemistry. They are discussed elsewhere; but it is impossible to avoid
frequent mention of them in any section of a treatise on alchemy.
<p>The metals are named after the sun and planets, our earth excepted;
and the astronomical signs of the heavenly bodies are also used for the
metals. Besides being assigned to gold, the word Sol means: positive, active
agent, heat, dryness, fire, masculine: Luna, or Lune, indicates the opposite
attributes, <i>viz</i>.: negative, passivity, cold, moisture, feminine.
Silver, the metal, and mercury, the metal, have the attributes of Sol,
so has Antimony, all metals being "masculine." The philosophic "mercury"
and the philosophic "salt" are both feminine; the former, when elaborated,
is ascribed to the moon, and frequently called Luna, or Lune, and Argent
Vive.
<p>The philosophic "sulphur' is masculine. Venus, or copper, is variously
considered; copper being acted on by acids or alkalies is often spoken
of as the hermaphrodite. The alchemists have taken advantage of this to
call their secret substance --- which is hermaphroditic also --- copper
and Venus. The word copper is used throughout the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>
to indicate their elaborated base. Others term it lead, antimony, litharge
and many other names.
<p>Eudoxus says in the <i>Hermetical Triumph</i>: "The philosophers speak
the truth negatively." which saying should be indelibly written in the
student's mind.
<p>Artephius writes: :But these things are so set down by the Obscure Philosophers,
to deceive the unwary as we have before spoken; for it is not this Ars
Cabalistica, or a secret and hidden Art? Is it not an Art full of secrets?
And believest thou, O fool, that we plainly teach this Secret of Secrets,
taking our words according to their literal signification? Truly, I tell
the (that as for my Self I am in no ways self-seeking or envious as others
are; but), he that takes the Words of the other Philosophers, according
to their common Signification; he even already (having lost Ariadne's clue
of Thread) wanders in the midst of the Labyrinth, multiplies Errors, and
casts away his Money for nought."
<p>According to these words, most students, and all would-be critics, wander
hopelessly in the Labyrinth, seeing they take the words of the philosophers
literally. The sage called a certain product of his work red lead, and
it is red lead accordingly, to the critic; another writer calls the same
substance "our vermillion or cinnabar" and straightaway, to the critic,
that which before was oxide of lead has become sulphide of mercury!
<p>Eirenaeus Philalethes writes in <i>Ripley Revived</i>: "Take this from
one that knows best the sense of what he has written; where we speak most
plainly, there be most circumspect (for we do not go about to betray that
Secrets of Nature) especially in those places which seem to give Receipts
so plain as you would desire, suspect either a Metaphor, or else be sure
that something is suppressed which thou wilt hardly find of thyself, without
Inspiration, yet to a Son of Art, we have written that which never heretofore
was by any revealed."
<p>If this art could be accomplished out of any one of twenty different
things, or their combination or even out of the then known seven metals,
it would have been common property long ago. But the materials of the Rebis
are so common, and the work so easy, that ingenious minds cannot stoop
to the simplicity of it. Eirenaeus expresses himself thus: "I do verily
admiringly adore the Wisdom of God herein, that an Art so true, so natural,
so easy, so much desired and sought after, should yet be so rarely found,
that the generality of men, learned and unlearned, do laugh at it as a
fable; it is therefore most certainly the Gift of God, who is, and ever
will be, the Dispenser of it, according to his good pleasure." And so say
the other philosophers.
<p>In the process the name "Saturn" is not used to indicate lead; but things
compact, earthy, and particularly it alludes to cold, moist darkness. For
unless you get this obscuration of your matter, and blackness, you accomplish
nothing." Out of this darkness comes light, and the empire of Jupiter;
not tin. It was so in the creation: "waste and void and darkness"; "and
the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said 'Let
there be light' and light was."
<p>Exoteric analogies to this esoteric art exist in all other arts; in
the teachings of philosophy; in the sacred writings of various religions,
and in their rituals; as also in the rituals of freemasonry, and the Rosicrucian
cult. Where, indeed, may they not be found? So multitudinous are the sources
from which analogies may be brought, and used fairly, that similes are
used such as the baking of bread, the making of wine, brewing of beer;
marriage, birth, life, death, resurrection; the parable of the "sower of
the seed, that went forth to sow.' The art is typified, at different stages
of the work, by names of all sorts of birds, beasts, fishes, creeping things,
and reptiles, on account of their appearances, habitations, or actions.
These similitudes are so apt, that authors copy each other, instead of
substituting some other type or allegory.
<p>They also write, as Basil Valentine has written, thus; "For I have written
nothing but what I shall bear witness unto after my death, and at the Resurrection
of my body." In his <i>Short Way and Repetition</i>, Basil Valentine gives
the following seriatim illustration of the work, <i>viz</i>.: a crowned
lion, a crowned eagle, a crowned serpent without wings, an uncrowned flying
dragon, a crow or raven, a peacock, a swan, a pelican, feeding its brood
with its own blood. The crowned lion, eagle and serpent are transmuted;
they are of the process. Basil Valentine described his process, as if done
out of ordinary gold; but this metal he did not use as his base; for, as
he says, it would require about ten pounds weight of the vitriol of gold
to do so. But as gold is the ultimate product or offspring, therefore,
it is permissible to call the parent, or sire, gold also. This substance
the philosophers called immature or unripe gold, or the "Green" Lion. In
the second stage of the work --- the analysis of the green lion --- a white
salt ascends, like snow, and adheres to the sides of the vessel, "much
like sublimate," as Ripley says. This is their Eagle, Sublimate, <b>Arsenic</b>,
Sal Alembroth, Sal Ammoniac, Nitre, Sea salt, ergo Aphrodite or Venus,
Sulphur of Nature, Icarus, etc. Its importance cannot be exaggerated.
<p>The "serpent that creeps in and out of stony places" is wingless and
remains below. It is non-volatile, and plastic, and also assists in the
transmutation. The entire volatile spirit has passed on into the receiver,
if one is being used. These three are the body, soul, and spirit of the
Lion. The wonderful manner in which the "soul" leaves the corrupting "body,"
and unites with the "spirit," is indicated by many writers; and also the
manner in which spirit and soul return to the altered body, unite with
it, and resurrect it in purity. On uniting these and placing them in an
hermetically sealed glass, they pass through the stages of the crow, peacock,
swan.
<p>The multiplication in quality and quantity is symbolized by the pelican;
and by another metaphor in Valentine's eleventh key. The crow, peacock
and swan symbolize respectively the black, the iridescent, and the white,
the latter being the White Stone. The Red Stone is symbolized by the Phoenix.
<p>The curious names used --- since the writers cannot use the real names
--- indicate, as before remarked, properties cognisable by the senses;
if this be kept constantly in mind, it may be that the correct name(or
names) will fit into the proper place. By the association of ideas in the
student, it is quite possible to alight on the association of ideas which
led the writers to select these obscure but permissibly relevant terms.
An instance has already been given, <i>viz</i>.: that hermaphroditic copper
--- called also the prostitute of metals --- suggested the name Venus-Venus
is allotted to the zodiacal sign of Taurus; therefore, Sendivogius writes:
"This is the Wood and Garden of our Nymph Venus," having previously spoken
of a Wood in which were Bulls (Taurus).
<p>Similarly, they speak of "the warlike god that dwells in the house of
Aries" (<i>Ripley Revived</i>). This is Mars, or Iron; but this riddle
is too easy, and the obvious solution should be suspect. Treasure is usually
buried, not scattered in full view. There is, however, a substance they
call Ferrum Philosophorum, which is a white salt, innocent of, or not derived
from, iron. A further reference to Aries occurs in the section on the Mercury
of the Philosophers.
<p>In the present day we are seriously handicapped by our scientific training
in our attempts to probe these tergiversations. We are taught to attach
one meaning to one word, so far as the limits of language allow. We strive
to get the "currency of thought" as pure and unadulterated as possible.
Thus we naturally fall easy victims to an apparent simplicity and candor
(the critics call it ignorance), which is in reality a deliberately designed
subtlety.
<p>Here is an example from Eirenaeus, the cleverest Sphinx of them all
: "Know, therefore, that Mercury hath in itself a Sulphur, which, being
inactive, our Art is to multiply in it a living active Sulphur, which comes
out of the loins of our Hermaphroditical Body, whose Father is a Metal,
and his Mother a Mineral; Take then the most beloved Daughter of Saturn
whose arms are a Circle Argent, and on it a Sable Cross on a Black Field,
which is the signal note of the great world, espouse her to the most warlike
God, who dwells in the house of Aries, and thou shalt find the Salt of
Nature; with this Salt actuate thy water as thou best knowest, and thou
shalt have the Lunary bath in which the Sun will be amended." Three pages
further on, he says: "Our Diana hath a wood... In this wood are at last
found two Doves, for at about the end of three weeks the Soul of the Mercury
ascends, with the Soul of the dissolved Gold; these are infolded in the
everlasting Arms of Venus", etc.
<p>Taking these seriatim, we here have suggested the following metallic
substances, viz.: Cinnabar, Antimony and Iron (commonly called the Martial
Stellate Regulus), Salt, Diana or Silver, Gold, Copper. We should remind
ourselves that the man who composed this riddle was no "child in these
matters." According to Eugenious (in <i>Euphrates</i>, Pars. 26, 27 and
Appendix) men, himself included, have worked for years with these materials,
and without result. The other authors who condemn antimony are too numerous
to mention.
<p>We find mention of two doves of Venus, and also of the ensigns of Diana.
The ensign of Diana is a crescent moon; if two of these are mounted on
two signs of Venus we get a mercury sign duplicated: the substance is indeed
the Mercury Duplex of the Philosophers, and is not a combination of common
silver and copper. What then is the substance, the proxima materia of the
alchemists? According to Norton, its colour is sub-albide, not quite white;
when dissolved it is apparently red. The alchemists, if they speak of it
at all, mix it up with the prima materia. Eugenius in <i>Euphrates</i>
calls it "Water and Earth, or, to speak more obscurely, mercury and sulphur";
notice the word "more". Other descriptions are that it is "cheap", "common",
"thrown away". The writers say that it is not likely that a student can
find in one book all that is necessary to the art. Each writer elucidates
one or more points, but the beginners cannot find any point more elucidated
than another; and consequently might not find the point or points of the
secret art. In the <i>Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers</i> are given
instances of men who toiled for years unsuccessfully until at last they
sat down, and collated the writings of many men, noting their agreements
and apparent differences, and ultimately grasped the truth.
<p>Jean d'Espagnet writes : "A studious tyro of a quick wit, constant mind,
inflamed with the study of philosophy, very skilful in natural philosophy
of a pure heart, complete in manners, mightily devoted to God, though ignorant
of practical chemistry, may, with confidence, enter into the highway of
Nature and peruse the books of the best philosophers; let him seek out
an ingenious and sedulous companion for himself, and not despair of obtaining
his desire." This applied perhaps to the student at the commencement of
the 17th century; it may not apply so aptly at the beginning of the 20th.
<p>The trouble is not entirely with the parables and the analogies, many
of which are of as much force and appropriateness now as then: it is also
with the names of chemicals, and the difficulty of estimating exactly what
substances they new. Again, it is certainly that they handled things which
were then unnamed, things which to-day are well known. It is of assistance
to get the most ancient books on chemistry such as Boerhaave, Maquer, and
work up through Ure and other men to the present day. Also books on mining
and metallurgy from Basil Valentine, and so consecutively to the 20th century.
It is curious that, even to-day, men of scientific attainments do not repeat
correctly that which the alchemists have said plainly enough.
<p>One author writes: "A white colour indicating that the Stone is now
capable of converting 'base' metals into silver; this passes through orange
into (iii) a red colour, which shows that the Stone is now perfect and
will transmute 'base' metals into gold." Not quite so; it is necessary
to ferment the white stone with silver, and the red stone with gold; otherwise
the process has to be continued for some time.
<p>Again, the white and red stones, after having been "fermented" and matured,
will not transmute base metals into silver and gold, for they must, in
the very first instance, be projected upon melted silver or gold respectively.
In <i>Fasciculus Chemicus</i>, it is said: "Thou, must with all care and
providence, take heed lest through ignorance of the right form of projection
the Divine work (when it is now brought to its complement, and degree above
perfection) should be destroyed. Therefore, he must know, that upon whatsoever
body thou shalt first project the medicine, it will change it into dust
answerable to the nature of the body on which thou didst project it, which
indeed is mystical, and to be wondered at: If, therefore, thou desirest
to bring thy elixir to the sun, let thy first projection be made upon the
sun, that in the sun it may be specificated. And so with the moon to the
moon, thou must thence proceed as hath been manifested clearly enough from
the authority of most approved philosophers."
<p>Also in item 15 of <i>Things to be Observed</i>: "Many men through ignorance
have destroyed their work, when at the first they made projection of the
medicine, upon the imperfect metals. For on whatsoever body thou first
of all projectest thy medicine, that same is converted into a frangible
mass, and shall be an elixir according to the nature of the body upon which
it is projected. So, as that if the projection be made upon Jupiter, or
Venus, it shall be a medicine which not only converteth the imperfect bodies
into Jupiter, or Venus, but also reduceth perfect bodies (to wit, the sun
and moon) into imperfect bodies; according to the nature of the body upon
which the medicine shall first be projected : which caused the most learned
Raymond (struck with admiration) to cry out in these words, "What! Is Nature
Retrograde? Some few candid writers have definitely given instructions
to project thus on melted silver or gold; others have passed it by in silence.
<p>As regards the colours observed in the work, they are black, then white,
and thirdly, red. The alchemists who give accounts of their own working,
say they saw these colours, and in this order. This cannot, therefore,
be an a priori bit of reasoning, but a statement of an obsrerved and accomplished
fact. Basil Valentine says he did the work more than once. Flamel writes
: "I have done the Mastery three times"; and also "I had indeed enough
when I had once done it, but I found exceeding great pleasure, in seeing
and contemplating the admirable works of Nature, within the vessels. To
signify unto thee, then, how I have done it three times.." And so other
writers.
<p>The author of <i>The Story of Alchemy</i>, on account of his sulphide
of mercury theory, had no use for the white; he could not fit it in, and
required only black and red. But every student knows --- if he knows nothing
else --- that the writers never contradict each other on this point; the
confection must be black in forty days, and continue some time; then other
colours --- green, azure and blue are mentionedthen citrine turning to
white. Decoction with increased heat produces red.
<p>Not only are the three colours, black, white and red absolutely essential;
but this order of sequence is a sine qua non. "If it be orange colour,or
half red within some small time after you have begun your work, without
doubt your fire is too hot; for these are tokens that you have burnt the
radical humour and vivacity of the stone. Laton must be blanched and made
white. This blackness doth manifest a conjunction of the male and female,or
rather of four elements. Orange colour then doth show that the body hath
not yet sufficient digestion, and that the humidity (whereof the colours
of black, blue and azure do come) is but half overcome by the dryness.
When dryness doth predominate, then all will be white powder,etc."
<p>No useful purpose would be served by multiplying extracts from the sages'
writings upon this point. Reverting for a moment to the theory of spontaneous
generation, it ought in all fairness to be conceded that the philosopher,
in searching for parallel illustrations, was handicapped, and not assisted,
by this theory. His work, as is abundantly evident, required two parents
for his noble offspring. He said his art was founded on universal law;
and here he was confronted by an unaccountable lapse on the part of Nature.
In the vegetable world, thorns, nettles, thistles, sprang up where none
were before, and therefore, apparently, no seed; and in the animal kingdom,
snakes, worms, scorpions, flies, ants, etc., were produced without parental
influence. He had to apologize for these things.
<p>In reality, the law governing his art was more universal than he imagined
--- if the solecism may be allowed. Our freedom from this false theory
only dates from the discoveries of Pasteur. We now know this dictum of
the alchemist to be true : "Nothing is generated but in its like, of the
same species." Having said this, because he had proved it, he called the
first substance "green lion" and "unripe gold," for so it was.
<p>When the sage speaks of a single simple mercury, it is necessary to
remind oneself that, for all we know to the contrary, the substances may
have been compounds, it would make no difference for if the working were
the same method as used by the alchemist we should get the same results,
if operating on the same subjects. But it might make a difference mentally,
when trying to discover what these"simple" things might be.
<p>A "simple" thing to an ancient chemist's mind was one he could not de-compound
or split up into two ore more dissimilar parts. The same definition applies
to-day. Such a substance he styled as belonging to the fossil kingdom,
in other words, a "stone." Thus, salts and also alcohol were considered
in Boerhaave's time to belong to the class of simple fossils. These few
examples of the dark sayings of the philosophers, and the brief comments
on them, must suffice, though it is evident that the correct interpretation
of their words and phrases is the only key which avails to unlock the mystery.

<p><b>Section IV</b>
<p><b>The Mercury of the Philosophers</b></center>

<p>The identification of the Philosophic Mercury is of prime importance.
It is, therefore, necessary to get a definite idea of the difference existing
between the common mercury (hydrargyrum) and that of the Philosophers.
It is vital to notice the dissimilarity in the manner in which each acts
on, or is acted upon by, other bodies. The principle points of agreement
or likeness are volatility, and some resemblance in appearance.
<p>Common Mercury is silvery and opaque, that of the philosophers is clear
at first, "as clear as the tears of the eye" (Bernard Trevisan, etc.),
but when its salt is dissolved in it, it is milky and opaque. "The Clear
and Diaphanous Menstruum, Philosophical Vinegar is by reason of the Spirit
of Philosophical Wine Diaphanous, not of a Milky Colour, but in the distillation
of a Menstruum it is made Milky, because the Acidity of the said Vinegar
is debilitated by the Aridity of the Body dissolved (in it)". <i>Secrets
of the Adepts</i>. Weidenfeld. Common mercury only becomes clear and transparent
by being dissolved in an acid. The two things are exactly opposite.
<p>Paracelsus says: "Whatever is volatile is of the nature of mercury."
"The name of mercury doth only properly agree with that which is volatile..."
<i>Hermetic
Arcanum</i>. The hypothesis of the sages is that everybody in the mineral,
vegetable and animal realms contains mercury, sulphur and salt. The philosopher's
mercury is an unctuous vapour, the vehicle of the essential seed. "Now
whilst the sperm is yet in the center, there may as easily be brought forth
a tree as a metal from the sperm, as soon an herb as a stone..." <i>New
Light of Alchemy</i>.
<p>This sperm or mercury is therefore in common mercury, but the latter
is a compound body differentiated, and specificated, or determined, into
a metal. The mercury of the sages is apparently undifferentiated or undetermined,
and is a simple, not a compound substance, from their point of view. The
alleged universal diffusion of their mercury makes one at first think of
water, as fluid or vapour. Eugenius Philalethes says: "For this thing is
not water otherwise than to sight." <i>Euphrates</i>. Again: "They (the
sages) mean not water of the well, nor dew..." <i>Coelum Terrae</i>. Neither
can we imagine water to be in the solid metals. Eugenius in his remarkable
<i>Euphrates</i>,
writes: "Whosoever seeks the philosopher's mercury in metals, of what kind
soever they be, is already out of the way... in metal, water there is none."
This dictum he further emphasis when speaking of antimony and vulgar mercury.
But as the philosophic mercury is built up into the substance of all metals
it is evident that it is still there, even if altered and combined, or
compounded.
<p>The stricture of Eugenius quoted above as regards metals, does not apply
to the use of gold or silver as a "ferment" or determining principle. Other
alchemists agree with Eugenius so far as to say that the extraction of
philosophic mercury from metals is very difficult. They concur in stating
that there is a despised and common substance, from which, with little
trouble and expense,,may be obtained not only the mercury, but also the
sulphur and salt, identical with that in silver and gold. This substance
is, of course, not named in their practical working, as a recipe; they
do not say: "Take so and so." They say: "Take antimony, or cinnabar, etc.
"Some writers, in speaking of the philosophic mercury, define it as "Our",
"Their", "The", "the mercury of metals" --- but a large number of writers
make no distinction. It is necessary, in the latter, to judge by reactions
and other properties of the subject under discussion.
<p>Bernard Trevisan says: "Mercury is the substance of all metals; it is
as a water by reason of the homogeneity which it possesses with vegetables
and animals and it receives the virtues of those things which adhere to
it in decoction". Hydrargyrum (and its salts) has no affinity to vegetables
and animals, quite the contrary. Kelly writes: "Those persons make a great
mistake who suppose that that viscous substance which is extracted from
sublimed mercury can in any case be the first substance of metals. Those
who destroy the natural composition of mercury, in order to resolve it
into a thick or limpid water, which they call the first matter of metals,
fight against Nature in the dark, like blinded gladiators. As soon as mercury
loses its specific form, it becomes something else, which cannot thenceforth
mingle with metals in their smallest parts, and is made void for the work
of the philosophers. Whoever is taken up with such childish experiments
should listen to the sage of Trevisan in his <i>Transmutation of Metals</i>:
"Who can find truth that destroys the humid nature of mercury? Some foolish
persons change its specific metallic arrangement, corrupt its natural humidity
by dissolution, and disproportionate quicksilver from its original mineral
quality, which wanted nothing but purification and simple digestion. By
means of salts, vitriol, and alum they destroy the seed which Nature has
been at pains to develope. For seed in human and sensitive things is formed
by Nature and not by Art., but by Art it is united and mixed.Seed needs
no addition, and brooks no diminution. If it is to produce a new thing
of the same genus, it must remain the very same thing that was formed by
Nature. All teaching that changes mercury is false and vain, for this is
the original sperm of metals, and its moisture must not be dried up, for
otherwise it will not dissolve. No water can naturally dissolve metals
except that which abides with them in substance and form, which also the
dissolved metals can again congeal. Only that water can rightly dissolve
metals which is inseparable from them in fixation, and such a water is
mercury". See <i>The Answer Of Bernard of Trevisan to Thomas of Bononia</i>.
<p>This extract endorses the saying that common mercury is a sperm of metals,
and it contains the seed: so also do the other metals. Other writers say
it is more than a sperm, it is a body, and that no new body of the same
genus is formed by Nature, of, or out of a destroyed body. The last sentences
quoted show that Bernard is describing the action of philosophic mercury;
for common mercury does not abide with metals in fixation, or fusion. "Mercury
is cold and humid, and of it, or with it, God has created all metals. It
is aerial, etc." Avicenna. These are the attributes of philosophic mercury,
which is their feminine subject, or wife.
<p>"It is a mistake to suppose that you can work miracles with a clear
limpid water extracted from mercury. Even if we could get such a water,
it would be of no use, either as to form, or proportion, nor could it restore
or build up a perfect metallic species." Bernard Trevisan.
<p>"The water of the sages adheres to nothing except homogeneous substances.
It does not wet your hands if you touch it, but scorches your skin, and
frets and corrodes every substance with which it comes in contact, except
gold and silver - it would not affect these until they have been dissipated
and dissolved by spirits in strong waters - and with these it combines
most intimately." Kelly. With the exception of "does not wet your hands",
all these attributes are different from those of mercury vulgar and its
salts. It cannot be said to wet your hand if it burns it; but it is not
necessary to urge this sophistry.
<p>The principle writers say "Our mercury which wets not the hands", but
they do not add Kellys' gratuitous addition of "if you touch it". Artephius
says: "Wash away the blackness from the Laten not with your hands, but
with the stone", <i>i.e</i>., with our mercury, or mercurial water. Also:"This
separation of the pure from the impure is not done with the hands." "This
Composition is not a work of the hands." It is in fact, done or carried
out in a sealed glass, and therefore does not, because it cannot and should
not, wet the hands. (Vide Artephius, Book III., Chap.XVIII., sect.IX.,
etc., and Chap. XIX., sect.V, VI, VII.)
<p>"We cannot with our own proper hands work on mercury, but with ten species
which we call our hands in this work, <i>i.e</i>., nine parts of water,
and the tenth of earth. ... Massa Solis et Lunae... our one Image out of
which springs white and red (not bare Sol and Luna as will spring out of
our mercury which was prepared with our own hands, but) the white and red
elixirs, which show that this Mercury which Nature hath made in the glass,
without our help, is far beyond that mercury which we prepared with a laborious
toil... For all they (the sophisters) dream of, is such operations which
are to be performed by hand, etc." <i>Ripley Revived</i>.
<p>Other extracts of the same purport could be given, but these should
suffice to show that the description of a fluid mercury which "does not
wet the hands", is not necessarily and inevitably pointing to ordinary
quicksilver. "In the first place, you must note that common mercury doth
not avail here; but our mercury is made of the best of metals, by the spagyric
art, as pure, subtle, clear as any well water, of a crystalline transparency,
without any impurity, etc..You must have the female or wife, which is the
mercury of the philosophers, or the materia prima lapidis... there is a
salt made of prima materia (this salt is called the philosopher's mercury,
which is coagulated in the belly of the earth). When this matter is brought
to light, it is not dear, and is found everywhere, children play with it:
it is ponderous, and hath a scent of dead men's bones, for two gilders
you may buy this a matter for the work". Basil Valentine.
<p>There is no indication here of common mercury, or its salts; further,
being, a metal, hydrargyrum is male, and positive. "By the name of Luna,
philosophers understand not the vulgar moon, which also may be positive,
in its operation, and in combining acts a positive part. Let none, therefore,
presume to try the unnatural combination of two positives, neither let
him conceive any hope of issue from such association" <i>Hermetic Arcanum</i>.
This Luna is the philosophers' mercury, or lune, or argent vive. "Our gold
and silver, sun and moon, active and passive principles, are not hose which
you can hold in your hand, but a certain silver and golden hermaphroditic
water, etc." Kelly.
<p>When we speak of common mercury, we mean one thing only, but when the
philosophers speak of mercury, they may mean one of many manifestations
of their mercury. So we might speak of sugar, and use the same word when
we really meaning the cane in which it exists, <i>i.e</i>., its "ore" or
"mine"; or in its other manifestations of dark brown, light brown, white
moist, crystalline, or even of treacle or syrup.
<p>As is mentioned in another section, our two luminaries, the sun and
moon, were anciently considered as "he" and "she".&nbsp; masculine and
feminine; husband and wife; father and mother; dry heat and cold moisture.
These names being allotted to metals became synonyms of gold and silver;
and here comes in confusion, for silver is not feminine, or wife, or mother.
Mercury looks like molten silver; is called quicksilver, argent vive, luna
vive. But "Mercury is a metal"; the philosophers' mercury is not a metal;
yet as they call it "mercury," therefore they appropriate all the other
names by which common mercury is known, even to corrosive and other sublimated
forms, and to cinnabar. Working on these lines of associated ideas, they
get to luna or lune, which rarely means silver.
<p>The term "white wife" does not mean silver, though the "red man" means
gold. "The White Wife, otherwise called the moon, is a female; it is a
coagulated mercury, but not fixed, etc". Eirenaeus. Thus writing on "mercury"
it is necessary to consider all those passages in which luna, lune, luna
vive, argent vive, and wife occur. Some few of them refer to silver, the
rest refer to feminine and passive qualities, and to their mercury, in
one or the other of its chameleon disguises.
<p>It will be noticed from what has been quoted, that the philosophers'
clear fluid mercury is a distilled liquid. It is, therefore, a separation
from something. Any clear solution of common mercury must be mercury, plus
the solvent. The latter is, therefore an addition, or synthesis, and not
an analysis. "It is a water that is very spirituous and volatile, therefore
within a month after it is distilled, it ought to be put upon its calx,
it will, without any external heat, boil if the vessel be closely shut;
and it will not cease to ferment or work, till it be all dried up into
the calx." <i>Medulla Alchymiae</i>.
<p>"The sages agree that the stone is nothing but animated argent vive.
But if your argent vive has no life, it is not what they mean. For this
water --- to be more frank than discreet --- is a viscous water, extracted
from the bowels of Jupiter, <i>i.e</i>., from white lead; it is moist and
wets the finger. If proper quantity of the sun be added to it, it is coagulated
and becomes brilliant --- the sun is dissolved into exceedingly limpid
mineral water. For the water dissolves the sun at the very same moment
that itself is congealed, and thus the solution of the one is the coagulation
of the other, at the very same instant. This compound is living mercury;
from which alone spring all colours. To regulate the fire is mere child's
play. After the conjunction it looks just like common limpid mercury and
does not moisten the finger, but is viscous and living." Kelly.
<p>"The sages have indeed purposely concealed their meaning under a veil
of obscure words, but it is sufficiently clear from their writings that
the substance of which they speak is not of a special, but of a general
kind, and is therefore contained in animals, vegetables and minerals. It
would, however, be unwise to take a round about road where there is a short
cut, and they say that whereas the substance can be found in the animal
and vegetable kingdoms only with great difficulty, and at the cost of enormous
labour, in the bowels of the earth it lies ready to our hands. It is the
matter which sages have agreed to call mercury or quicksilver.
<p>Our quicksilver, indeed, is truly a living substance, so called not
because it is extracted from cinnabar, but because it is derived from the
metals themselves. If common mercury be fixed by fixation from its crude,
volatile and watery superfluities, it may, with the aid of our art, attain
to the purity and virtue of the substance of which we speak. And as this
mercury is the metallic basis and first substance, it may be found in all
metals whatsoever. Nothing contributes so much to a ready apprehension
of our secret as a knowledge of our first substance, and after that of
the distinctive species of minera which is the subject of investigation
of the philosophers". <i>Ibid.</i> "The matter of our stone, mercury, is
a commonly diffused subject, and though it is found with greater ease in
some minerals, it may be discovered everywhere". <i>Ibid</i>.
<p>Jean D'Espagnet writes in <i>Hermetic Arcanum</i>: "Now these bodies
must be taken, which are of an unspotted and incorrupt virginity; such
as have life and spirit in them ; not extinct as those which are handled
by the vulgar; for who can expect life from dead things; and those are
called impure which have suffered combination; those dead and extinct which
--- by the enforcement of the chief Tyrant of the world --- have poured
out their soul with their blood by martyrdom," etc. This has been interpreted
as meaning that the materials should be quite pure and unadulterated. This
explanation is insufficient; that alchemists commonly took impure and adulterated
materials, and purified and separated them. "Unspotted and incorrupt virginity"
means not combined with another substance,e.g., not mercury combined with
silver, or antimony; it does not exclude a substance masked and covered
over with impurities. A virgin may be covered in filthy clothing. See <i>Golden
Age Restored</i>.
<p>Also fire is masculine, therefore a substance which is in the metallic
state, and has undergone fusion by fire, has endured its fiercest embrace,
and cannot therefore be called either virgin, or living. "The metals ---
especially the gold of the vulgar --- are dead, but ours are living, full
of spirit, and these wholly must be taken: for know, that the life of metals
is fire, whilst they are yet in their mines; and their death is the fire,
<i>viz</i>.,
of melting. Now the first matter of metals is a certain humidity mixed
with warm air, and it resembles fat water, sticking to everything pure
or impure". Sendivogius. These are not properties of common mercury, or
its salts.
<p>"The first and principle matter of metals is the humidity of air, mixed
with heat, and this the philosophers called mercury. And although the body
of metals be procreated of mercury (which is to be understood of the mercury
of philosophers), yet they are not to be harkened unto, that think the
vulgar mercury is the seed of metals, and so take the body instead of the
seed, not considering that the vulgar mercury spoken of, hath its own seed
in itself. They dissolve metallic bodies, whether it be mercury, or gold,
or lead, or silver, and corrode them with sharp waters, and other heterogeneous
things, not requisite to the true art, and afterwards join them together
again, not knowing that a man is not generated of a man's body cut to pieces."
Ibid.
<p>We cannot find any unmistakable indications in writers of repute for
using mercury or its salts; except for the purpose of breaking down the
gold which has to be added as a ferment to the red stone. This is after
the work has been virtually accomplished. The mercury thus employed has
to be fumed away, and in other ways got rid of entirely, before making
the ferment.
<p>The philosophers' mercury is simple at first, and is afterwards compound.
"It is a stone, and no stone, Spirit, Soul, and Body... it is volatile
or flying, and clear as a tear, afterwards it is made citrine, then saltish...
it is but one thing to which nothing extraneous may be added". Arnold Villanova.
<p>"The third principle is a clear compounded water, and it is the next
substance in complexion to quicksilver, it is found running and flowing
upon the earth." Lully. As mercury is used to dissolve gold, so the sages
use their mercury to dissolve their unripe gold,<i> i.e</i>., the pure
but imperfect (or immature) mineral base. "Our mercury, indeed, is cold
and unmatured in comparison with gold; but it is pure, hot, and well digested
in respect of common mercury, which resembles it only in whiteness and
fluxibility. Our mercury is, in fact, a pure water, clean, clear, bright
and resplendent, worthy of all admiration... it is living, fluxible, clear,
nitid, as white as snow, hot, humid, airy, vaporous and digestive, and
gold melts in it like ice in warm water." Eirenaeus.
<p>This solution of gold being done by their mercury, they sometimes call
an amalgamation; and because the gold dissolved, or philosophically melted,
they call the water of mercury their fire, a furnace, a calcining fire,
etc." This agent is sought by many but found by few. It is a precious liquid
which does not tender its services to the multitude, but is the handmaiden
of the sages. Some think it is common mercury exposed to violent heat in
a glass vessel, and rarefied. But all these persons are ignorant philophasters.
Raymond, indeed, describes a similar process, but he means something quite
different, <i>viz</i>.: That our mercury is to be purified in a brilliant
vessel, not to elicit water from it, but to free it by fire from its crudity,
and to make it more readily soluble. Neither in one way nor the other can
our water be elicited from common mercury, nor the mysteries of our magistery
be unlocked. There is no menstruum which can dissolve this mercury that
it shall retain its form; yet that is what our art requires." Kelly.
<p>Eirenaeus writes : "It is a fact that the mercury which is generated
in the bowels of the earth is the common substance of all metals - since
this mercury will enter into combination with every kind of metal --- etc."
If these remarks were true as regards common mercury or its salts, there
would be no necessity to style it "the" mercury, and "this" mercury: this
extract shows that "their" mercury is not vulgar mercury. Again, Eirenaeus
in the Metamorphosis of Metals, says : "The mercury gained from any metallic
or mineral body. possesses the property of assimilating common mercury
to its own nature." So the two mercuries are quite distinct from one another,
but akin: and according to this, if you get the "mercury of gold," it could
change common mercury into the "mercury" of gold.
<p>The philosophers in the analysis if their unnamed "mineral" substance,
produce a "viscous humidity" which is akin to all metals; they, therefore,
boldly assert the theory that this is the substance which Nature first
forms in the earth, and from which she evolves all metals; gold being the
last and best. This is their chaos, containing the male and female principles,
the seed and the menstruum, the mercury, sulphur, and salt; their hermaphrodite.
The sulphur of gold or silver is added to it to specificate and expedite
evolution in the required direction.
<p>Although this chaos will evolve gold, yet according to Basil Valentine
you cannot get this chaos out of gold; you must first have their solvent,
or mercury. He says: "Without the spirit of mercury, the Universal of the
World to be gotten merely from the body of Sol, is impossible." And: "In
gold there is no waterish humidity at all, unless it were reduced again
into vitriol, which would be but an useless and unprofitable work, and
would require huge expenses... but what countries, goods, lands, have been
dilapidated this way, I waive to discourse of... nature having left a nearer
way to keep, and to imitate that, that they also might take heed to fall
into such extreme and inextricable poverties."
<p>Their theory being that gold is evolved out of lower forms, it would
seem to be fairly obvious that the intermediate and not the ultimate form
should be wrought on. He further says : "The solar mercury, sol, being
never brought so far unto destruction, neither did the ancient philosophers
ever make use of that way, as being a thing clean contrary unto Nature,
containing indeed a humidity, but it is a mere elemental waterish humidity,
after its dissolution, and good for nothing, etc."
<p>Eirenaeus says that the work can be done out of common gold; but what
may be possible to a master may be impossible to a tyro. In <i>The Celestial
Ruby</i>, he says "In order to elicit our gold from common gold, the latter
must be dissolved in our mineral water, which does not wet the hands; this
water is mercury extracted from the red servant, and it is capable of accomplishing
our work without any further trouble to the artist. The chief object of
your perseverant efforts should be the discovery of this mercury, or the
albification of our red laton."
<p>I understand that though Nature is said to make this viscous humidity
from which metals are evolved, yet that man cannot find it in that condition.
Apparently, he has to make it, or rather educe it from metals or minerals,
or from the chosen unnamed subject, alluded to by the sages. Eirenaeus
definitely asserts : "Our homogeneous agent, our mercurial ponticum, which
is pure, crystalline without transparency, liquid without humectation,
and in short the true divine water, which is not found above ground, but
is prepared by the hand of the sage."
<p>On considering the point, it seems evident that a solvent is required;
as it is evident that powdered or finely divided metals, or the oxides
of the metals could yield no moisture or fluid on distillation. The same
applies to minerals, but not to the salts, or so-called vitriols. "Let
the practitioners of alchemy understand that the kinds of metals be not
transmuted except they be brought into their first matter." Arnold.
<p>Such a solution would contain two things, the solvent and the dissolved
substance, hence the name Rebis. This solvent is apparently called mercury
unactuated or simplex, crude mercury, etc. Ripley says in the <i>Concordance</i>:
"When I speak of mercury, understand mercury more common than common";
meaning, I presume, more common than ordinary quicksilver.
<p>This dissolution is mentioned by most writers; but its consideration
does not come under this section, which treats only of the mercury itself,
and its source of origin, etc. "Our water is the life of all things, and
if you can by much toil obtain it, you will have both silver and gold.
It is the water of saltpetre, and outwardly resembles mercury, while inwardly
at its heart there burns purest infernal fire. Do not be deceived by common
quicksilver, but gather that mercury, which the returning sun, in the month
of March, diffuses everywhere, till the month of October, when it is ripe."
<i>Fount
of Chemical Truth</i>.
<p>This month of March, or Aries, is mentioned by Eugenius, Combachius,
Sendivogius, Basil Valentine, D'Espagnet, and others. "No philosopher has
ever openly revealed this secret fire, and this powerful agent, which works
all the wonders of the art..." Eudoxus. "Artephius, Trevisan, Flammel have
passed in silence the preparation of our mercury." <i>Ibid.</i> Yet this
"preparation" is precisely that which the student needs to know: this preparation
of the solvent, and the preparation of the "mineral" base which has to
be dissolved, or as they put it "calcined by our fire into a redness,"
are of the first work. This work nearly all writers are absolutely silent
about.
<p>They generally start with the second work (which they call the first),
namely, the separation of the "rebis" into distilled fluid in the receiver
and calx in the retort. "Again, in the second preparation, that which by
authors is styled the FIRST (because they omit the first)." <i>Hermetic
Arcanum</i>. As a "mercury" is used at the beginning, middle, and end of
the work, it will perhaps be pertinent to give a few extracts from authors,
asserting that common mercury is not employed; at any rate until after
the work is accomplished. "Common Mercury and Gold we none occupy Till
we perfectly have made our Stone, Then with them two our Medicine we multiply."
"In common Mercury thou dost me seek; In Alkali and in Alembroth, In common
Sulphur and Arsenic eke Which makes many a man to dote, Common Mercury
is not good." "Gold with Mercury stands us in stead Our Medicine for to
multiply After our Physic's Stone be red." "I councell thee this lesson
learn, Our Mercury is but of one thing In our vessel thin and clear. Common
Mercury in him is none Neither Gold nor Silver in him none is : Of Metals
we make not our Stone By proportion more or less. All manner of Metals
we deny Until the time our Stone be wrought." <i>Theatrum Chemicum Brit</i>.
<p>Pages might be filled with quotations from the alchemic treatises, all
stating in plain language that ordinary mercury is useless, and worse that
useless. The same remark applies to its salts. J.S. Weidenfeld, in <i>Secrets
of the Adepts</i>, gives a list of seven "mercuries," mentioned by philosophers;
this seems to be an over-elaboration; for, as he includes animal and vegetables
"mercuries," few of those he recites belong to this work. Jean d'Espagnet
mentions three, but all are but elaborations of the first.
<p>Hear what Eirenaeus Philalethes says in his <i>Exposition upon Sir G.
Ripley's Fourth Gate</i> : "From what hath been said may appear the strong
passive delusion that hath taken many men of our age, and formerly, who
with the chemist in Sendivogius, cannot dream of any Mercury, than that
Mercury which is to be bought at druggists, which they take and sublime
variously to make it clean, and then with Hogheland mix it with Gold, applying
all the words and sayings of philosophers to this their mixture."

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>It is not my intention to deal with the subject of sulphur in an esoteric
manner. There is little or nothing fresh to be said from that point of
view. It is handled in <i>Aesch Mezareph</i> in relation to alchemy, in
Rosicrucian literature on material, and on higher planes; especially in
the writings of Boehme. In alchemy, "sulphur" is that chemical substance
which, in a masculine fashion, specificates or determines an undetermined
matter in a certain matter in a certain direction. It is the active agent.
<p>The common sulphur is not used in the alchemic universal work, <i>i.e</i>.,
it does not go into the hermetically sealed glass, it takes no direct part
in making the "medicine" which transmutes. Sulphur was used with common
mercury to break up common gold and to prepare it for making a gold ferment;
but the mercury and sulphur must be evaporated away. Basil Valentine writes:
"Take of pure gold which is three times cast through antimony, and of well
purged mercury vive, being pressed through leather, six parts make of it
an amalgama, grind twice as much of common sulphur, let it evaporate on
a broad pan in a gentle heat under a muffle, stirring it still well with
an iron hook; let the fire be moderate that the matter do not melt together;
this gold calx must be brought to the colour of a marigold flower, then
it is right."
<p>Here the usefulness of sulphur ends: for the gold (and any sulphur and
mercury adhering to it) is dissolved in aqua regia; and further prepared,
so that it is impossible that any sulphur can be present. Roscoe, in his
<i>Treatise
on Chemistry</i>, Vol.II., Metals, Page 404, writes: "The substance termed
calx of gold by the early chemists was nothing more than the finely divided
metal." Apart from this, any compound of gold and sulphur is a dark coloured
powder, and not the purple mantle described by the alchemist.
<p>Enough has been said in other sections to convince an unbiased reader
that common sulphur in any form or combustion does not "enter" into the
work. The terms "sulphur and "salt" cannot be separately discussed ---
at least, not usefully --- for they are intimately intertwined in theory
and in practice; thus, the sublimed salt in the second process --- and
which is "much like the common sublimate" --- is properly called the "Sulphur
of Nature." In contradistinction to the volatility of philosophic mercury,
sulphur is that which is fixed, and which gives fixity, or permanence of
manifestation on the plane to which it belongs. It coagulates and fixes
"mercury," and although sulphur is said to be made volatile by conjunction
with the mercury, yet both this fixity and volatility are only relative
or comparative, not absolute. It is a harmonizing of, or a compromise between
the two qualities : each gives of its own, and partakes of the other's
distinctive attributes. It is the ideal wedded state.
<p>The sulphur is not "sulphur" only, it also contains its own inherent
"mercury"; so also"mercury" contains its own inherent, but inactive, "sulphur."
When sulphur is added to mercury it constitutes a true inoculation; this
occurs twice in the work, by different sulphurs. Therefore the alchemist
said --- in <i>Hermetic Arcanum</i>, Canon 26 : "Nevertheless spiritual
love polluteth not any virgin; Beia might therefore without fault (before
her betrothal to Gabritius) have felt spiritual love, to the end that she
might thereby be made more cheerful, more pure, and fitter for the union."
This is rather unnecessary sophism.
<p>The rebis consists of mercury and sulphur; the rebis is one body ; this
rebis is divided by the alchemist into its constituent parts, each is "purified,"
and then the sulphur is restored to the mercury; thus the sulphur is its
own, and not another. The second sulphur added to it, is a separate "determined"
sulphur, viz., that of one of the perfect bodies. The first sulphur then
is not a true inoculation, or it would be auto impregnation.
<p>The second sulphur imparts its own proper colour, form, and attributes
to the resulting new body, and determines or specificates it to silver,
or to gold; if fermentation be rightly performed. This sulphur is true
seed, for it remains with, and is built up into the body.
<p>Sendivogius says: "There be some that suppose Saturn to have one kind
of seed, and gold another, and so all the rest of the metals. But these
are foolish fancies : there is but one only kind of seed, the same is found
in saturn which is in gold, the same in silver which is in iron." These
words apply to the common seed of metals before differentiation into saturn,
gold, etc.; Sendivogius has here pushed back the enquiry to the beginnings
of things in general. Hence the necessity for an already differentiated
sulphur in the work.
<p>Ripley says : "You must know of a certainty and believe me, that the
Stone may be finished in the white and the red, both of which spring out
of one root, without common gold, or silver." This is a further assertion
of an evolutionary law; and evidently the gold and silver are added, merely
for the purpose of effecting a considerable saving of time. Mercury and
Sulphur are equally universal theoretically, for they are considered to
be present in all tangible bodies. Yet, according to the writings of the
alchemists, mercury seems to be the more abundant, or more in evidence.
Frequently it appears to be feebly attached, evaporates with the aid of
slight warmth, is volatile, and is therefore continually flying about,
more or less free, unless --- or until --- "coagulated" by an appropriate
sulphur. Hence the wings on the heels, helmet, and caduceus of Hermes :
the union of Hermes and Aphrodita begets or produces Hermaphrodita, or
Rebis.
<p>If sulphur be the form, how is it that this inherent sulphur of x, in
the Rebis, does not result in x sulphur again, in spite of the added sulphur
of gold, or at the most we might expect a body containing the mixed sulphurs
of x and gold. The answer is not far to seek; first, this sulphur of x
will of itself --- the conditions being favorable --- ultimate in gold.
These sulphurs are therefore akin. Now it is the presence of this crude,
undetermined golden sulphur in the cheap and common substance x which makes
the art possible, to any student, who is so favored as to use the right
material, and the correct method.
<p>Two or three extracts from Basil Valentine here given show that the
golden-natured sulphur is also found elsewhere. "You will find that the
nature of the golden sulphur resideth only in those metals which are comprehended
among the red. . .the astrum of sol is found not only in gold, but may
be prepared artificially out of copper and steel, two immature metals,
both which as male and female have red tingeing qualities, as well as gold
itself." "Such souls and goldish sulphurs are found most effectual in Mars
and Venus."
<p>"The tincture or antimonial sulphur is of wonderful efficacy, and is
equivalent unto potable gold" "Antimony stands in a near relation and affinity
unto gold, which is the reason why antimonial sulphur purgeth the soul
of gold, graduating the same to a very high degree. On the other side,
the gold can meliorate in a short time the soul of antimony, and can bring
it to a firm fixation, exalting antimony and gold to an equal dignity and
virtue," etc.
<p>It is to be noted that he does not say here how you are to be rid of
the tendency of these sulphurs to produce iron, copper, and antimony respectively.
The metals mentioned contain impure sulphur also; the different varieties
reputed to be present in each metal can be ascertained from the writings
of Geber, Bacon, and others. Arnold, it is said, asserts that vulgar sulphur
is the cause of all the imperfections present in metals. Boehme says :
"The sulphur principle is an other thing than common suplhur."
<p>The sulphur present in the White Stone is en route for the golden quality,
and if not fermented with silver, can be rubified into the Red Stone by
merely increasing the artificial external heat. But heat only will not
rubify the sulphur of the white metals, lead and tin, into golden sulphurs.
It is necessary to reduce them first, into what the alchemist calls the
first or original condition, before anything can be done (except of course
when "projection" is being performed).
<p>As regards lead, Kelly says : "This is the tree of unwholesome fruits,
on which must be inoculated the twigs of sol." As regards tin, Aesch Mezareph
says : "In particular transmutations, its sulphurous nature alone doth
not profit, but with other sulphurs, especially those of the red metals,
it does reduce thick waters (duly terrificated) into gold." This is not
the universal work, but a "Particular" one; no gold of plusquam perfection
is formed; but bare gold. Many other particular works are mentioned by
writers; thus: "If you extract the Salt out of Vitriol, and rectify it
well, then you have a work which is short, and tingeth luna into Sol."
(Valentine). In treating their vitriol, the mercury comes first, and the
remainder or chaos contains the sulphur and salt; but in operating on vitriol
of gold, the sulphur comes first, and the salt second, the undried remainder
being the mercury of gold. But nearer to perfection the body is, the more
difficult is the extraction of the sulphur.
<p>Bernard Trevisan held the opinion that "in gold there is nothing but
mercury coagulated by its own sulphur," and "the philosophers have affirmed
sol to be nothing but argent vive matured" also "gold is nothing but mercury
anatized, <i>i.e</i>., equally digested in the bowels of a mineral earth."
Golden Tract says: "Internal sulphur is nothing but mature mercury." So
that here everything is traced back to that one primary fluidity, on the
which, the spirit of God moved at the beginning. But this is pure theory.
<p>Sulphur is generally distinguished by the title of "red," thus --- <i>Turba</i>
: "Nothing is more precious than the red sand of the sea; it is the distilled
moisture of the moon joined to the light of the sun and congealed." Flamel
: "The fat of the mercurial wind joined to the scum of the red sea." Aesch
Mezareph mentions that Solomon fetched gold from Ophir by way of the Red
Sea.
<p>In the generality of cases, the remakes are but as so many fresh enigmas
to the student, who cannot without illumination distinguish whether the
light is near or afar off. To the instructed, however, all things are clear;
and the expounding or propounding of riddles is done with equal facility.
Therefore, also, he can see that the erroneous paths he has trodden are
being are being pressed by the feet of others. There seems to be no remedy
but inspiration, and that can come but from one only source.
<p>The analogy between the modus operandi of reducing common gold and their
"unripe gold" --- or proxima materia --- each to its respective prima materia,
is very striking. Gold is broken up by common mercury and sulphur; is then
dissolved in aqua regia --- of sal ammoniac (or other chloride salt) and
saltpetre. "Unripe" gold is solved by a crude "mercury," and in the subsequent
analysis, their philosophic sal ammoniac and saltpetre are produced. With
these latter --- and not with the common variety --- the finely divided
common gold (or perhaps its oxide), is reduced into its prima materia;
and is then called the gold "ferment."
<p>The White Stone in its perfection is --- though a compound containing
its own sulphur --- are called mercury, or wife, or lune. The same remark
applies to the Red Stone, before its fermentation by gold. Either Stone
is called Beiya, or Bride; and the silver ferment for the one, and the
gold ferment for the other, are each styled Gabritius, or Bridegroom, etc.
Therefore when mercury is spoken of as the "seed of metals" --- instead
of the sperm --- the saying can only be true on account of its sulphur;
for this latter is the fire and seed. In <i>Metamorphosis of Metals</i>
Eirenaeus says: "I am now speaking of metallic seed, and not of Mercury."
The element water encloses those of air and fire, and these three in the
form of a fluid "fall into the earth, and there they rest and are conjoined,"
and all together, when matured, constitute the mercury, or bride luna.

<br>
<br>
<p>It is obviously of prime importance that the names of wrong material,
and wrong methods of working should not become anchored in the mind. Those
who have allowed this to take place "will never be inclined again by their
own genius to the plain way of nature and light of truth." Hermetic Arcanum
(i.e.,without the aid of a guide or master). The philosophers' mercury
"may be sooner met with by the force of the seeker's intuition, than be
found by reason or toil". <i>Ibid</i>. "...some affirm that the concretes
of the vegetable and animal kingdom; others, that minerals as antimony,
sulphur, and marchasites, and the rest of the minerals; others, that metals
themselves, gold and silver; but others of a more subtle wit, that vitriol
and common salt be the subject of the glorious Stone:which opinions the
sincere searcher of nature ought to leave free to their authors...&nbsp;
For immediately this thing which composeth the stone is but one; which
is divided into a fixed and a volatile, into an agent and patient, and
so it is two; and although it be so divided, yet it doth by no means lose
its unity. So also when it is divided into salt, sulphur, and mercury,
and so is threefold, neither doth this division destroy its unity." <i>Sanguis
Naturae</i>.
<p>A list of things that are useless for the work should be made from all
the books available. Animal and vegetable substances are ruled out first;
then read the <i>Golden Tract</i>, the first treatise in the first volume
of the <i>Hermetic Museum</i>, 1893 : and there will probably be little
left to blunder over. Their mineral substance may not resemble anything
metallic; it may be as dissimilar as is a gorgeous poppy to its tiny seed.
Preconceived ideas are obstructive to progress; the mind should remain
in a receptive, passive condition until a composite photograph emerges
from the superimposed impressions.
<p>"As soon as anyone discerns the intention of the philosophers, from
the seeming sense of the letter, the dark night of ignorance will fly away,
and a glorious morning of light and knowledge will break forth, etc." Hermetic
Art. "An undetermined matter being the beginning of all metals and minerals
it follows, that, as soon as anyone shall be so happy as to know and conceive
it, he shall easily comprehend also their natures, qualities and properties."
Urbigerus. "...despair and errors, which they (beginners) can never escape
till they so far understand our writings, as to discern the subject matter
of our secrets, which being known, the rest is not so hard." <i>Ripley
Revived</i>.
<p>Eirenaeus, in his commentary on Ripley, and in his four treatises in
the <i>Hermetic Museum</i>, explains a large number of the obscure sayings
of the writers. As a "set off" against these discoveries, he propounds
other enigmas, apparently easier to be understood, but in reality much
more misleading. The same applies to his instructions for doing the work;
thus, in one place he advises closing the neck of the glass very securely
with a thick layer of sealing wax; in another he says let the flame stream
to the top of the vessel; and in another "if he be over-provoked, he will
certainly break the vessel, and fly, and leave thee the ruins of thy glass,
etc". The probable explanation is, that in cohobating a mixed fluid, the
heat is gentle as a steam bath, and the glass temporarily stopped; when
the fluid is distilled off, the dry calx can be calcined at a dull red
heat; in the third case, the purified mixed confection is ripened up to
the White Stone, and the heat must always be extremely gentle or "remiss",
the glass neck having been closed by fusion.
<p>The use of the words "horse dung" has also been difficult to explain
by those who have not had access to a sufficient number of alchemic books.
"This supernatural Fire, my Son, the Philosophers have hidden in their
Books in parabolic expressions, naming the same by innumerable names, and
especially they term it Balneum Mariae, a moist Horse-dung, Menstruum,
Urine, Blood, Aqua Vitae, and the like... And what is signified by Horse-dung,
I mentioned before, <i>viz</i>., that by Horse-dung is meant the water
of the Prima Materia, for it warm and moist like Horse-dung, but it is
no common Horse-dung, as many ignorant persons do suppose and understand."
<i>Hydropyrographum
Hermeticum</i>. The author gives extracts in proof of this from Alanus,
Alchidonius, Arnold Villaneuva, Alphidius, Aristotle, Hermes, Morienus.
<p>This is the agent that dissolves and "putrefies" ordinary gold and silver,
reducing them to "oily calces" suitable for use as ferments. It is the
"Water and Spirit of the Prima Materia" and must be prepared first, for
without it, no step can be taken in this art. Calcination: the student
must judge by the kind of substance in use, as to the kind of calcination
which is intended. The ordinary dry fire calcination is undoubtedly used,
but if it be used on a tender, plastic material the whole vitality is burnt
up. As they call this magic water their fire, it is evident that they will
have no scruple --- if they so choose --- in calling its action upon a
certain substance a philosophic calcination. Nearly all their work is done
by retort and receiver; crucible work is rare, until they come to actual
projection.
<p>Their virgin and blessed water is also named Bird of Hermes, Vessel
and Seal of Hermes, a melting and calcining Furnace, "for this Water dissolveth
all Metals, and calcineth them." Their first water besides calcining, also
"melts" the necessary substance; so that to "melt" our mineral base, or
saturn, or antimony, or gold --- <i>i.e</i>., "our unripe gold" --- means
to dissolve it by means of this Water which is their Fire. This water,
which dissolves the mineral base in bulk, will also dissolve its separated
parts in detail, and in the re-uniting of them acts as the flux, or medium
of conjoining the parts; it is their solder; the priest which unites the
red man and the white wife, yet "both were born in the priest's bed."
<p>In Ripley's first gate, Eirenaeus has a parable of the King marrying,
as his Queen, the daughter of a water bearer; "of which water bearer I
told you that his body, his pitcher and the water in it, are all one...
the King and also his son, and he (the water bearer) is greater than both".
These then are all different parts of one thing --- the Prima Materia Gold
is the sulphur of it --- the King; the Queen is the salt of it; the water
bearer, etc., is the fluidity which is necessary for intimately uniting
these.
<p>It is not, therefore, necessary --- indeed, it is wrong ---to unite
two or more things to form our prima materia; but to find the one thing
and separate the superfluities from it, re-uniting the remainder in correct
proportions. "He who knows not how to make many things out of one, knows
not how to conjoin many things into one." This wonderful agent is also
their pestle, by which they accomplished pounding, grinding, trituration.
Eugenius is ironic about the man who in this work "makes his philosophic
contrition with a hammer." It is with this mercury they make their "amalgams";
as is mentioned elsewhere.
<p>Sericon: "The gold of the wise, boiled and well digested with a fiery
water makes Ixer. Red is the sure colour for the golden matter, and the
nature thereof is not sweetness; therefore, we make of them Sericum, i.e.,
Ixer." <i>Aureus</i>. Crude or partially wrought things are considered
to be sour, bitter,&nbsp; poisonous or harmful, dangerous to inhale: and
wrought things, the contrary. That which comes out of Ixir is Elixer,<i>
i.e</i>., drawn out of water.
<p>Azoth: --- Bernard Trevisan writes: "Azoth is not raw quicksilver (or
argent vive) simply extracted out of the mine, but is that which is extracted
by argent vive itself out of the dissolved bodies." "Wherefore if laton
be an unclean body it is depurated by such an azoth... and by this laton
purified by azoth, we make our medicine. Indeed this azoth is made of the
elixir, because elixir is nothing else but a body resolved into a mercurial
water, after which resolution, azoth is extracted out of it, <i>i.e.</i>,
in animated spirit. And it is called elixir from e which is "out of" and
lixis which is "water," because all things are made out of this water,
and the elixir is the second part in the philosophic work, as rebis is
the first in the same work." Epistle to Thomas of Bononia.
<p>It is essential to know and to memorize the order in which the products
occur, or it will be impossible to know to what part of the work the writer
refers. As they have mixed up the different stages, this is the only way
of sorting them out; for the writer may have begun his treatise with the
preparation of the ferment, using ordinary mercury, then gone to the other
stages in any order. But the evident use of common mercury will have&nbsp;
biassed the student's mind throughout the treatise.
<p>The first stage (or ante first part), viz., the preparation of their
crude mercury, and the selection and preparation of the base, is omitted.
Afterwards the order is Solution, and formation of the Rebis or Sericum
or Ixir; the Elixir in the sealed glass separates into the azoth above
and the laton below; the azoth descends in dews, or rains, and ultimately
whitens the laton, without the laying on of hands. The water precedes the
oil; the spirit precedes the soul; elixir precedes azoth; rebis, is the
chaos, the viscous humidity, and contains all. In the laton and azoth stage,
the green lion has become a black lion and the volatilized azoth, eagles.
These are intermediate stages, the dew or rain is a menstruum, a fire,
a sharp vinegar, antimonial --- saturnine --- mercurial argent vive. Saturnine,
for it comes out of darkness; antimonial, because it becomes like fine
black minute atoms (like the powdered black variety of antimony tri-sulphide),
it splashes all about in the glass; mercurial, for a volatile portion ascends
from it.
<p>Height, depth, width, altitude, profundity, latitude: the highest altitude
is red, the second is white; profundity is black; latitude is extension
in quality and quantity and powder to permeate other things. Whenever a
writer speaks of the heavenly influences, such as those of the sun and
moon; or speaks of sky, clouds, the earth, the sea, it is necessary to
remember that he refers to the things which are in his laboratory. There
he has his mountains and valleys; his heavens, earth and sea; the salt
in the center of the earth; his snow on the hill tops.
<p>It is only from a substance which is not "determined" in the direction
of any one of the seven then known metals, that the alchemist made his
rebis. All specificated or determined things are rejected. Thus Urbigerus
(Aphorism 28) had no kind of metal in the calx in his retort, neither had
he (Aphorism 37) and "mercury, or any other kind of metallic substance"
in the distilled fluid in the receiver. This axiom, or sine qua non for
it amounts to that --- is the center of the circle, from which a worker
cannot err; and radiating out from that center are the determined things
amongst which students can, and, do, wander for years, without apprehending
the center, that broiling, frying company, who call themselves chemists,
but are indeed no philosophers." She (nature) had in her bosom two things
"not metalline" without doubt one was white and the other red. It is ---
he says --- necessary to find the Lunaria plant growing on the top of India's
mountain; this is quite a common symbol, and another writer says: "It is
necessary to visit both the Indies"; all these, and other things occur
in Section I. of <i>Lumen de Lumine</i>.
<p>Unless one is enthusiastic in a wise and enduring way, the philosophy
of alchemy is dreary reading, and is impatiently abandoned for practical
work on immature ideas of the substance, and hazy notions of the working.
In the philosophic desert is the trial, and also the reward. At the end
of <i>Euphrates --- </i>by Eugenius Philalethes --- the commentator S.S.D.D.
writes: "I will end as I began, by saying, I have read many alchemical
treatises, but never one of less use to the practical alchemist, than this."
Yet the practical man is, in that work, given open and plain information
as to what he must avoid; the hints on the material are quite as plain
as discretion would allow; and there are no false suggestions.
<p>The reader is also well repaid by studying <i>Coelum Terrae</i> (by
Eugenius); he there learns that he is not following the path traversed
by the philosophers unless he gets white clouds condensing to "thick heavy
water as white as any snow" followed by red. He will find where to look
for the invisible white salt; the Mars that unites with this Venus (Venus
the spouse of vulca, <i>i.e</i>., labour or toil). In his poem is the following:
"Those sighs return to drops again"; what, in practice, is the signification
of these sighs? They are mentioned by other writers, though presented in
less poetic garb.
<p>It is so with many other indications, mentioned as occurring in the
laboratory work, which are apprehended by the ordinary five senses, and
assessed at their proper value by the intellect. The theory of evolution
implies the unity of nature; it therefore seems logical that gold could
be made out of the white metals, lead and tin; and silver out of the red
metals, iron and copper; by bringing these metals back to the point at
which the paths began to diverge. Or, as the alchemist puts it, by adding
citrinity to the white metals, and argent vive to the excessively red:
a sort of leveling to the standard required. Geber mentions ten medicines
for the five common metals --- including mercury; five of these for introducing
a solar quality, and five for introducing a lunar quality.
<p>But the universal medicine is the best, and will make any metal gold
or silver, according to the intention of the philosopher, and the quality
of the medicine. The superfluities of the common metal go off in fumes.
Men who have been ultimately successful write that they toiled unsuccessfully
at the making of these ten particular medicines, when they were "Geber's
cooks"; but after fruitless years, they turned their attention to the universal,
and then accomplished the work.
<p>It is necessary to distinguish between things that are possible to an
accomplished master only, and those things that are within that capabilities
of an earnest student. Eirenaeus, though making mistakes for several months,
had the conviction that he was already a master; so that it is evident
that to alight on the right material, makes clear to the mind the sayings
of the philosophers; as has been mentioned. In every block of marble is
a potential Venus de Milo, but it requires inspiration to see it, and a
master to educe it into actuality. In the subject we seek is enclosed a
Galatea, who must not only be made visible, but must also be infused with
life. Having now given in the very words of alchemists of repute, direct
contradiction to some of the more important misinterpretations of modern
critics, the raison d'etre of this treatise is accomplished. Much more
might be said, but considerations far more cogent than those of space forbid.
I will conclude with a few extracts from Boehme: "Do not toil and trouble
yourself in that manner and way which you mention, with any gold or minerals,
it is all false. . .It is not of earth, stones or metals, and yet it is
the ground of all metals; a doubled mercury, yet not quicksilver, or any
other mineral or metal." As regards the working or process upon the correct
materials, he says that a close parallelism exists between it and the life
of Christ. "Now it behooves the wise seeker to consider the whole process
with the humanity of Christ from his opening in the womb of his mother,
Mary, even to his resurrection and ascension, The Magus must keep and observe
this process also with his Alchymy."
