<blockquote>Take Erth of Erth, Erths Moder,
<br>And Watur of Erth yt ys no oder,
<br>And Fier of Erth that beryth the pryse,
<br>But of that Erth louke thow be wyse,
<br>The trew Elixer yf thow wylt make,
<br>Erth owte of Erth looke that thow take,
<br>Pewer futel faire and good,
<br>And than take the Water of the Wood:
<br>Cleere as Chrystall schynyng bryght:
<br>And do hem togeder anon ryght,
<br>Thre dayes than let hem lye,
<br>And than depart hem pryvyly and flye,
<br>Than shall be browght Watur schynyng,
<br>And in that Watur ys a foule reynynge,
<br>Invisble and hyd and unseen,
<br>A marvelous matter yt ys to weene.
<br>Than depart them by dystillynge,
<br>And you schalle see an Erth apperinge,
<br>Hevie as metal schalle yt be;
<br>In the wych is hyd grete prevety,
<br>Destil that Erth in grene hewe,
<br>Three days during well and trew;
<br>And do hem in a body of glass,
<br>In the wych never no warke was.
<br>In a Furnas he must be sett,
<br>And on hys hede a good lymbeck;
<br>And draw fro hym a Watur clere
<br>The wych Watur hath no peere,
<br>And aftur macke your Fyer stronger,
<br>And there on thy glasse continew longer,
<br>So schal yow se come a Fyer;
<br>Red as blode and of grete yre,
<br>And aftur that an Erth leue there schale,
<br>The wych is cleped the Moder of alle;
<br>Then to Purgatory sche must be doe,
<br>And have the paynes that longs thereto,
<br>Tyl sche be bryghter than the Sune,
<br>For than thow hast the Maystrey wone;
<br>And that schalbe wythin howre three,
<br>The wych forsooth ys grete ferly:
<br>Than do her in a clene Glass,
<br>Wyth some of the Watur that hers was.
<br>And in a Furnas do her againe,
<br>Tyl sche have drunke her Watur certaine,
<br>And aftur that Watur give her Blood,
<br>That was her owne pewre and good,
<br>And whan sche hath dranke alle her Fyer,
<br>Sche wyll wex strong and of grete yre.
<br>Than take you mete and mycke thereto,
<br>And fede the Chylde as you schowlde do,
<br>Tyl he be growne to hys full age,
<br>Than schal he be of strong courage;
<br>And tourne alle Bodies that leyfull be,
<br>To hys own powre and dignitye,
<br>And this ys the makyng of owre Stone,
<br>The trewth here ys towlde yow evereech one.
<p>For all that taketh any other wey,
<br>Mouch they looseth and mouch they may,
<br>For trewly there ys no other way of righte,
<br>But Body of Body and Lyghte of Lyghte,
<br>Man of Man begottyn ys,
<br>And Beste of Beste to hys lykenes,
<br>Alle the fooles in the worlde seeken;
<br>A thynge that they may never meeten,
<br>They wolde have Metalle owte of hem,
<br>That never was fownde by worldly men:
<br>Ne never was fownde by Goddis myghte,
<br>That they schould beare any such fyghte.
<p>All Saltes and Sulphures far and nere,
<br>I interdite hem alle in fere,
<br>Alle Corosive waters, Blood and Hayre,
<br>Pyss, Hornes, Worms and Saudiver,
<br>Alume, Atriment, Alle I suspende,
<br><b>Rasalger [Rafalger] and Arsnick I defende,</b>
<br>Calx vive, and Calx mort hys Brother,
<br>I suspende them both, one and other,
<br>For of alle things I wyll no moe,
<br>But sowre Elements in Generall I say soe,
<br>Sun and Moone, Erth and Water;
<br>And here ys alle that men of clatter,
<p>Our Gold and Sylver ben no common plate,
<br>But a sperme owte of a Bodi I take,
<br>In the wych ys alle Sol, Lune, Lyfe and Lyghte
<br>Water and Erth, Fyre and Fryght:
<br>And alle commyth of one Image,
<br>But the Water of the Wood makyth the marryage;
<br>Therefore there ys none other waye,
<br>But to take thee to thy Beades and praye:
<br>For Covetous Men yt fyndyth never,
<br>Though they seek yt once and ever,
<br>Set not your Hearts in thys thyng,
<br>But only to God and good lyvynge.
<br>And he that wyll come thereby,
<br>Must be meeke, and full of mercy:
<br>Both in Spyrit and in Countenannace,
<br>Full of Chereti and good Governaunce;
<br>And evermore full of almes deede,
<br>Symple and pewerly hys lyf to leade:
<br>Wyth Prayers, Pennaunces, and Piety,
<br>And ever to God a lover be,
<br>And alle the ryches that he ys sped,
<br>To do God wrschyppe wyth Almes deede.
<p><b>In Arsenyck sublymed there ys a way streight</b>,
<br>Wyth Mercury calcyned nyne tymes hys weight
<br>And grownde together with Water of myght
<br>That bereth ingression lye and lyght,
<br>And anon as they togyther byne,
<br>Alle runnyth to Water bryght and shene,
<br>Upon thys Fyre they grow togethyr,
<br>Tyll they be fast and flee no whythyr;
<br>But than feede hem fowrth wyth thy hond,
<br>Wyth mylke and meate tyle they be stringe,
<br>And thow schalt have there a good Stone,
<br>Whereof and Ounc on fowrty wyll gone:
<br>Upon Venus or on Mercury,
<br>Thys Medicyn wyll make thee merry.
<p>And yow that have fowght mani a day,
<br>Leave worke, take yowre Beades and pray,
<br>For the longer that yow seeken,
<br>The longer yt ys or yow meeten;
<br>And he that now sayne would be sped,
<br>Lysten to my Daughter Megg:
<br>For schhe scall tell yow trewth and ryghte,
<br>Hearken now wyth all your myght.
<p>I am Mercury the myghty Flower,
<br>I am most worthy of Honour;
<br>I am sours of Sol, Luna, and Mars,
<br>I am genderer of Iovis, many be my snares:
<br>I am setler of Saturne, and sours of Venus,
<br>I am Empresse, Pryncesses and Regall of Queenes,
<br>I am Mother of Myrrour, and maker of lyght,
<br>I am head and hyghest and fayrest in syght:
<br>I am both Sun, and Moone,
<br>I am sche that alle thynges must doone.
<br>I have a Daughter hight Saturne that ys my darlyng,
<br>The wych ys Mother of all werking,
<br>For in my Daughter there byne hydd,
<br>Fowre thyngs Commonly I kydd:
<br>A Golden seede, and a spearme rych,
<br>And a Silver seede none hym lich;
<br>And a Mercury seede full bryght,
<br>And a Sulphur seede that ys ryght.
<p>Of my Daughter wythowten dred,
<br>Byn made Elyxirs whyte and redd,
<br>Therefor of her draw a Water cler,
<br>The Scyence yf thow lyst to leare.
<br>Thys Water reduceth every thynge,
<br>To tendernes and to fyxing:
<br>It burgeneth growyth and gyveth fryght and lyght,
<br>Ingression lyfe and lastyng in syght:
<br>Alle ryghteous werkes sooth to say,
<br>It helpeth and bryngyth in a good way:
<br>Thys ys the Water that ys most worthy,
<br>Aqua perfectissima &amp; flos mundi:
<br>For alle werks thys Water makyth whyte,
<br>Reducyng and schyning as Sylver bryght:
<br>And of the Oyle greate marvell there ys,
<br>For all thyngs yt bryngyth to rednes:
<br>As Cytrine gold he ys full high,
<br>None ye so redd nor none ys so worthy:
<br>And in the Erth grete marvele ys hyd,
<br>That ys first so black, and than so red:
<br>And alle ys done in howres three,
<br>Thys may be cleped Gods Prevetie:
<br>Than the Erth shall torne red as blood,
<br>Citrine Gold, naturall cleere and good,
<br>And than the red Oyle to hem schall goe,
<br>Red Ferment, and red Mercury alsoe,
<br>And grow togeder weekes seaven,
<br>Blessed be Almyghty God of Heven:
<br>One Ounce of thys Medycine worthy
<br>Cast upon two hundred ownces of Mercury:
<br>Schall make Gold most royall,
<br>And ever enduring to holde tryall;
<br>Fyre and Hammer Tuch and Test,
<br>And all essayes most and least.
<br>And yt ys Medycen above common Gold,
<br>To mans body as God yt would.
<p>For Gold that cometh from Oare,
<br>Is nourished with fowle Sulphur:
<br>And Engendered upon Mercury he ys,
<br>And nouryshed by Erth and Sulphur I wys,
<br>And our Gold ys made of the pewer soules,
<br>In the wych ys now Corrupcyon foule:
<br>But purged pewre as clene as Chrystall,
<br>Body and Spyryt and Sowle wyth all;
<br>And so they grow into a stone,
<br>In the wych Corrupcyon there ys none;
<br>And than cast hym upon Mercury,
<br>And he schalbe Gold most worthy,
<br>Now have you heard the makyng of our Stone,
<br>The begynyng and endyng ys all one.</blockquote>
