<br>
<p><b>The Preface to the Reader.</b>
<p>When novelties or strange events ensue,
<br>When we beholding greatly do admire
<br>But being stake, or common to our view
<br>Farther to gaze thereon have no desire
<br>Thus I affirm, for that I know in man
<br>Such secret wonders in ye world are none.
<p>Having a body the World representing
<br>In which God’s Image is so lively set
<br>I mean ye Soul, which is our understanding
<br>Within our Bodies pure and delicate
<br>Wherein such wonders are more secretly knit
<br>As more to seek will more delight thy wit.
<p>Then what thou art, having care thyself to know
<br>Thy Substance, state, condition and degree
<br>The rarest wonder that ye world can show
<br>Is represented in thine own Body.
<br>Elements vegetable and Mineral
<br>Are all contained in thy Animal.
<p>God by his power the world of nothing made
<br>Which nothing is immortal seed most sure
<br>Of which ye world took root that cannot fade
<br>But firm and stable to ye and endure.
<br>After which Image man was framed I say,
<br>In ye same Seed, joined to a Fattie Clay.
<p>First know, no tongue is able to express,
<br>Nor pen can write the wondrous works of God.
<br>His hidden Secrets will he not confess
<br>Nor make them common flying all abroad
<br>His Divine Wisdom clearly doth foresee
<br>To place his gifts to each in their Degree.
<p>To some he doth his knowledge more impart
<br>Than unto some, whose natures divers fall.
<br>Others again more skillfull in this Art,
<br>And such wise men Philosophers we call,
<br>Among the which many delight to see
<br>How Nature each thing frames in their degree.
<p>First they divide what she united had
<br>By which they find three Principles as ground,
<br>In everything that Nature forth had led.
<br>Mercury, Salt and Sulphur pure are found,
<br>Which Elements of Earth, Water and Air,
<br>Do make their Quintessence, which they call Fire.
<p>Of this again a Medicine pure they frame
<br>Which sees sick bodies from Infirmities.
<br>This pure Elixir is the very same
<br>That cures the Metals of foul Leprosie
<br>This is the Jewel which so few can find
<br>Though sought of some till smoke ye eyes do blind.
<p>Whose lucks with skill compared, may fitly be
<br>They want ye vessels Hermes used to bear,
<br>Which if they had smoakes they should not see
<br>Nor half such tolling, out their cloakes to wear
<br>Neither whole years, nor charge, they should not spend
<br>But in short time attain the happy end.
<p>Wherefore be well advised ere thou begin
<br>What is ye substance whereof Gold is made,
<br>Then boldly mayst thou surely enter in
<br>And take upon you this most worthy trade
<br>For many thousand herewith be deceived
<br>And of their error will not be bereaved.
<p>And thus in hope thou wilt observe this rule
<br>And with attention, understand it well
<br>Remembering Virgil since thou wast at school
<br>And Ovid who of famed heavens tell,
<br>And know their Gods who was to each their Sire
<br>So mayst thou come to attain thy desire.
<p>Likewise do learn our mineral spirits three
<br>From whence they rise, <i>Arsenick</i> of which being one,
<br>The other Sulphur, ye last Mercury.
<br>The Fuming Spirits chiefest of our Stone
<br>One of those poisonous with his piercing breath
<br>Congeals Quicksilver to a solid Earth.
<p>But if thou think this strange and far untrue
<br>Then make a trial hereof if thou wilt
<br>Taking my former Counsel given you
<br>If otherwise, your work is surely spilt
<br>But I assure ye if thou have our Stone
<br>Thou shalt attain thine own desire anon.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Author to Reader.</b>
<p>Now gentle reader on ye I bestow
<br>A Secret which as yet thou dost not know.
<br>If this my book thou read with good advice,
<br>Shall find ye same ye sayings of ye wise
<br>How sundry works compiled are in brief
<br>Light charge, short time, which two I hold as chief.
<br>All is not writ, some doth behind remain
<br>Which is a whetstone for to sharp thy brain,
<br>That it may cut as keen with wisdoms edge
<br>Thou mayst attain to make ye golden wedge.
<br>Let Nature therefore grave within thy heart
<br>That which by writing no man will impart.
<br>Which is a thing so easy for to gain
<br>That understand well will requite thy pain.
<br>Then praise the Author where thou comest in place
<br>As higher powers above shall give ye grace.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Authors Will and Testament.</b>
<p>If from this life of breath I be bereaved
<br>Then as a Log, a Cold, a breathless Stone
<br>Compare my carcass which I have bequeathed
<br>To sleep in rest till resurrection
<br>Where flesh and bone to dust shall there decay
<br>Until they join again at latter day
<br>Until which time Reliques lay as Rags,
<br>Of n esteem but yet my Soul Divine.
<br>Let it ascend out from the Earthly Dregs,
<br>Among the Angels up in Heaven to shine.
<p>Whereof no tongue be able to express
<br>The glorious love and joyfull blessedness.
<br>And he who shall this Book and Verses read
<br>If by the same he profit chance to find
<br>First in my Love I wish him to dread
<br>And let my Chaos be within thy mind
<br>That thou may’st shew thyself a grateful man
<br>To think on him which is dead and gone.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Author to All the Faithful Sons of Philosophy.</b>
<p>I write to such as have desire to see
<br>Into the grounds of true Philosophy.
<br>But unto such as choke themselves with smells
<br>Of Earthy fumes, come from mean minerals
<br>Or else from stinking odours against kind
<br>Such of my verse but little good shall find
<br>Until they first these rules do listen well
<br>To which most briefly I mean here to tell
<br>Then know that the Philosophers first ground
<br>Is everywhere, yet hard for to be found.
<br>Yet England hath it always in store
<br>For twenty thousand Philosophers and more
<br>This matter next unto the Soul of man
<br>More precious thing God ne’er created none
<br>And ‘tis offence unto his Godhead still
<br>With violent hands this Stone to wrong and kill
<br>Yet Natures first invention must be let
<br>Before the first material you can get
<br>Else Earth with will quake and groan and sadly grieve
<br>If you will touch ere Nature will off leave.
<br>For when as Nature she has done and wrought
<br>There we begin, or else our work is naught.
<br>One Chaos rude as God this World did make,
<br>To man his little World from Chaos take.
<br>Proportion several is therein I ween
<br>Of Gold and Silver five nto fifteen
<br>Not common Gold and Silver which is dead
<br>For that is living which is in our Lead.
<br>If thou canst free him from their Prison Dark,
<br>I will account of thee a Learned Clarke.
<br>For I assure thee in a shower of Rain
<br>Cold heat moist dry hear soft therein remain,
<br>Both thick and thin, a body spirit and soul,
<br>Which Mercury Salt and Sulphur we do call
<br>The four elements thou therein shalt find
<br>Fire Water Air and Earth by kind
<br>Clear then the Prison and thence set him free
<br>And place them richly in a fair City,
<br>Walled strongly about to keep them from their foe
<br>Then hast thou rid them from their greatest woe
<br>When in this City that a while they dwell
<br>The heat therein will make them look like hell
<br>For that there bodie never did abide;
<br>So hot a climate as they felt that tide.
<br>But use will make them well for to endure
<br>A stronger heat when season will procure
<br>Then will they strip them to shirts I fear
<br>Till white as Snow to sight they do appear
<br>Under which white is flesh red as blood
<br>Which will not show till they have passed Noah’s flood,
<br>Then pearl and Ruby will they give thee store
<br>Silver and Gold what wilt thou wish for more.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Prima Materia.</b>
<p>1. Prima material which many can of clatter
<br>Is not found in ought which Earth Imbowells
<br>Nor on Earth growing comes our first Matter
<br>As Vegetables Herbs Fruits or Flowers
<br>Nor Animal nor excrements thence flowing
<br>Or anything that on earth is growing.
<p>2. Yet in each one of these thou mayest find
<br>Three sorts of humours therein do conjoin,
<br>As Water nourishing the Earth by kind.
<br>When Sun it burns refreshed by rain
<br>So is the first; next, oilie Radical
<br>Which is the Substance of heat natural.
<p>3. Last, humour watery as cement knitting
<br>Bodys of Stones, metal living as dead
<br>For Mercury, Salt and Sulphur being
<br>United together and equally spread
<br>As taste smell and colour the Quintessence call
<br>Of Vegetable, Mineral or Animal.
<p>4. Our Salt, a dry water and lively is he
<br>Which many for Quicksilver did it take
<br>But the three Spirits our Mercury must be
<br>And the three Spirits our Mercury of which we must make,
<br>Our noble Elixir both white and red
<br>Our Adrop so precious and our red Lead.
<p>5. First Matter of Metals is clammy like glue,
<br>Quicksilver a nearer made of the same thing,,
<br>Then Liquable Sulphur joined with them two
<br>Whence vapour doth rise and to the earth cling.
<br>Continual heat making decoction
<br>And thereby made a metalline fusion.
<p>6. Our Stone one thing of Elements four, being
<br>The Earth and body wherein Earth dissolving
<br>Air and Fire the Soul our Compound ripeneth.
<br>All those well from one thing thou mayest divide
<br>Which one thing known doth all things else exceed.
<p>7. To give the Light what this one thing may b
<br>When of the first this hour had of birth
<br>And bearing life which vegetable growing
<br>Till ripe as grass his state quite overthroweth
<br>It is our Chaos as I erst did tell
<br>If what I said thou do remember well.
<p>8. Then not accepted but as base cast by
<br>Yet of the wise is held in great esteem
<br>To bring them health, wealth and free liberty
<br>And from all thralldom will he them redeem
<br>If by true Art they have the means to use him
<br>For worldly wealth they never will refuse him.
<p>9. If that thou wonder where thou shalt it find
<br>I answer thee that thou in every in every place
<br>Art sure to see if it thou be not blind
<br>Through natures mantle covered hath his face
<br>But if thou can’st it not yet understand
<br>Look that wit speed thou do withdraw thy hand.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Principles of Nature and of Art.</b>
<p>The grave Philosophers in time o yore
<br>Divinely wrote that Gold within the ore
<br>As other Metals first engendered be
<br>Of Sulphur and Argent Vive called Mercurie
<br>And Gold say they, springs from another Mine
<br>Where Argent Vive and Sulphur red do shine
<br>Which by our artificial fire not great
<br>The purity thereof we may compleat
<br>That is more Perfect by a 1000 fold
<br>Than either Indian or Arabian Gold
<br>Which is concocted by heat natural
<br>Within the bowels of the Mineral
<br>For heat perfecteth all things in his kind
<br>This must the Artist know if he will find
<br>This must the Artist know if he will find
<br>The narrow way that God to Nature gave
<br>Is boil, boil, boil if fruit thou seek to have
<br>And this by seething doth dissolve congeal.
<br>Learn well this lesson if thou wilt prevail
<br>And Patience have with thy continuance
<br>Lest too sharp fire cause much grievance
<br>Yet as the Infant food first is weak
<br>But stronger as he grows and learns to speak.
<br>So at the first our work has easy fire,
<br>And is increased as ripeness doth require.
<br>So at the first our work has easy fire,
<br>And is increased as ripeness doth require.
<br>And in a Vessel that is made threefold
<br>Sure sealed up therein concoct thy Gold.
<br>For our one thing that is to wit our Stone
<br>And by one way which is decoction
<br>And in one Vessel do we putrify,
<br>Dissolve, Congeal, and Seeth continually.
<br>First grows he Black in dissolution
<br>Until the end of Putrifaction.
<br>That as the moisture doth congeal and dry
<br>Gay Orient Colours therein thou shalt espye
<br>And afterwards true Whiteness shall appear
<br>Like Fishes Eyes or Diamonds shining clear
<br>Thus White at last when water yields to air
<br>Which yields to fire then red it doth appear.
<br>And often yellow red changing hue
<br>And oft it melt, congeals before Whiteness true
<br>It doth dissolve, colour and putrify
<br>Killing itself reviving joyfully
<br>After his Whiteness do increase the fire
<br>Keep safe the Ashes which thou dost desire
<br>Which God shall give thee molten crowned to red
<br>Which King, Philosophers have honoured.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>An Excellent Work</b>
<p>From Natures four united into one,
<br>Draw forth the menstrue of our Precious Stone,
<br>Bodies calcined therewith dissolve to water
<br>Which them is brought into his own first Matter
<br>His parts divide the subtile from the gross
<br>So shalt thou gain when others live by loss.
<br>The unfixt light spirit superior part of stone,
<br>Which is made pure by distillation
<br>Then joined with the inferior part purged clean]
<br>From parts superfluous ‘tis the earth we mean
<br>By Calcination and Solution
<br>Is brought at length to quick Ceration.
<br>Then both are purged by Putrifaction
<br>And wisely handling Sublimation
<br>This Oil of Sulphur made of Trinity
<br>Doth Geber call his Oleagivity,
<br>Or Aqua Secunda for the second place
<br>Tis our Tincture ferment and our Gold
<br>And form of Metal secret doth unfold
<br>Our Sulphur Tincture and our gory blood
<br>Which must pass waters of Noah’s flood
<br>His qualities are to consolidate
<br>Into a Medicine he will penetrate
<br>As meat or nutriment of Sulphur true
<br>And doth convert and multiply thereto
<br>Doth purge and cleanse and also giveth life
<br>To Sun and Moon to Husband and to Wife.
<br>It will conjoin natures that disagree
<br>To wit I say the spirit and body
<br>Between which two is the pure Oil the mean
<br>And natures of them both it doth contain
<br>Without the which they never joined will be
<br>But as a dust on metal it would flee
<br>The reason is that Humour radical
<br>That is chief cause that metals melt at all
<br>Is here defeat for imbibitions lack
<br>Which to be fluent often see thou make.
<br>This fixed earth the Humour will embrace
<br>And earth in humour rejoyceth in like case,
<br>Fixing the same against all fires trial
<br>Against the Humour Earth makes volatile.
<br>Hereof it comes that both being truly mixed
<br>Is fixed volatile and volatile made fixed.
<br>The Elixir fusible dissolve in simo [dung]
<br>Fixed parts calcined often see this thou do
<br>Then fix them till the Elixir that they tinn
<br>Which must melt quickly Mercury to stain
<br>And after into perfect Sun and Moon
<br>Which else from fire will flee before they join
<br>This Elixir is Medicine which doth cure
<br>Imperfect metals of extreame Sulphur
<br>Corrupt that form and bring another pure
<br>With Golden Tincture ever to endure
<br>To try Elixir of it be perfect.
<br>On Copper plate melt some with gentle heat
<br>If without smoke it spread and tin throughout
<br>Is incombustible and perfect then no doubt
<br>If that our Medicine thus purified
<br>With Splendour of our Moon be garnished.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A Short Work.</b>
<p>By long concoction of our Watery Stone
<br>Is Sulphur made of Air and Fire alone
<br>With middle Air make the Red earth to flow
<br>Of this Quick-silver Philosophers allow
<br>Which will not moisten but congeal a maine
<br>Such flying spirits as it doth retain
<br>And Mercury called the first Essence
<br>Must drink two parts of this for his defense
<br>To join our Sulphur and our Mercury
<br>Mix and fix them to our Lunary
<br>Congealing both in our mercury Water
<br>Which of all Metals is the first Matter
<br>Our Earth of Crude Silver our Gold alone
<br>For in all Tinctures is an inward Stone
<br>Our Quick-silver is a Spirit quick of life
<br>Ferment to bodies being Man and Wife.
<br>It is Our Air and Our Fire fugitive
<br>Penetrating bodies and giving life
<br>Mercury Salt and Sulphur lovingly
<br>Join as Sperms of Creatures certainly
<br>Our agent body we do call our Lune
<br>The patient Mercury which to him must join
<br>The Menstrue nourishing them in the pot
<br>Is made of the Salt of Alembrott.
<br>Three days in milk at first our Stone is sure
<br>Then add we salt to blood like flesh impure
<br>Which in the water will coagulate
<br>Then are his members framed to good estate
<br>And then his Soul God on it doth bestow
<br>That is to say a Power wherewith to grow
<br>Then springs our ferment which we call our King
<br>Which drops of water from dead earth did bring
<br>Our Stone made quick and born as here you see
<br>With milk at first do nurse him carefully
<br>To three part Elixir being grown strong
<br>Give but two parts of food for doing wrong
<br>One par of elixir more than food
<br>The better to digest and conclude.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Another Work of the Whole Magistery.</b>
<p>1. Whoso intendeth our rich Stone to make
<br>Natures true grounds at first must not forsake
<br>Two Sulphurs which two Mercuries contain
<br>One Red and moist, one White and pure and clean
<br>Which Spirits and bodys first Calcine with fire
<br>And then again turn earth to perfect Air.
<p>2. Dissolve to Gum which Hyle we call
<br>The which to Air distill again you shall
<br>Earth so to Water that to Air you turn
<br>Which Air to earth again congeal and burn.
<br>Wash not the Womb with too much Water clear
<br>For so you may extinguish quite the fire.
<p>3. Moderately feed it at each time you may
<br>Digest then distill the phlegm away
<br>For fixed shall the volatile remain,
<br>Which then sublimes to Air or volatile earth
<br>Ferment his Soul and then you have our birth.
<p>4. For body Spirit and Soul sure knit on one
<br>Is our Elixir and our Precious Stone,
<br>Which oft dissolve, congeal with Water clear
<br>Till fixed oil no fires force shall fear
<br>Which oil calcine into a Powder Pure
<br>To White or Red Elixir have you sure.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Another (1.)</b>
<p>First putrify thine Elements together
<br>Then separate them first with easy heat
<br>By distillation purify with Water
<br>But Air and Fire by Sand with great fire
<br>The fiery Soul out drawn with spirit of water
<br>Which bring on his White foliate soon after
<br>The Spirit retains the Soul without annoy
<br>And Soul the body willing doth embrace
<br>By means of Spirit each one in other joy
<br>The fire or Soul distill dark clouds deface
<br>Then will he make of Silver, Gold in view
<br>And eke the White of Copper, Silver true.
<br>So bring this work into a perfect White
<br>Put feces of this fire, distilled with Earth
<br>Being deprived of all moisture quite
<br>Then shalt thou have a new conceived birth
<br>When this dry Earth hath drunk of moisture
<br>Full fifty part that it can drink no ore
<br>Which feed at first by drops and light calcine,
<br>But first digest in sime [dung] for a day
<br>Encrease the fire wisely at every time
<br>If too much water be then it’s a troubled sea
<br>But if too little then burnt to cinders it been
<br>Therefore in feeding always use a mean
<br>The Earth having drunk of Quicksilver his fill
<br>And is most White with fire it then sublimes
<br>For foliate Earth like ashes up shall still
<br>Which separate from the inferior dust shall be
<br>And further profit shall thou never see
<br>This Sulphur White dissolve in Water red
<br>And oft Congeal Dissolve sublime the whole
<br>And the white Sulphur like to dust shall spread
<br>The White will Copper turn to Silver pure
<br>The Red turns silver to Gold most sure.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Another (2.)</b>
<p>This fountain red of life original
<br>Whose subtile Spirit is fire natural
<br>Attending on moisture radical
<br>A Quintessence fully spiritual
<br>An Aqua Vitae most etherical
<br>Whose nature is well near incorruptible.
<p>2. This Spirit wit a gentle fire up rose
<br>Heating the pipes of water when it did press
<br>His Liquor Mercury, flame Sulphur shows
<br>The last from Sal Armoniack tells no less
<br>This Spirit rectify well, lute well the glass
<br>Lest the exceeding subtile Spirit out pass.
<p>3. The middle Liquor likewise keep aside
<br>Reserve the phlegm with which his foeces laver
<br>Let them digest till they have water dyed
<br>Then put on fresh reserving still the former
<br>Continue this till water be dyed no more
<br>Which keep aside as erst you did before.
<p>4. The foeces will like Crystal clearly shine
<br>Which do provoke both seed and urine store
<br>To cleanse the stomach liver and the spleen
<br>And other virtues it hath many more
<br>In his curcubit close the head on cover
<br>Put on his spirit two inches floating over.
<p>5. Set this on ashes to digest a space
<br>The Spirit separate cleanly from the grounds
<br>Then pour on fresh continuing the like case
<br>Till black faeces be Quick smoaking found
<br>Then hath the Crystal animated the spirit
<br>With a tart Balsam ferment doth inherit.
<p>6. Then in a glass these spirits firmly close
<br>Cover in Sand where flame goes round about
<br>Which in six days is White as any Rose
<br>Calcine and fixed is the earth no doubt
<br>With a fourth part then of Spirit animate
<br>Let both a day by Balneo incorporate.
<p>7. In Ashes out a water weak distill
<br>Pour on more spirit doing as before
<br>Until the fixed Salt retain his fill
<br>And that the water loose his force no more
<br>Which weighing is increased full three fold
<br>And fixed then make volatile be bold.
<p>8. This Matter then within his Limbeck close
<br>Receives his Sulphureous humidity
<br>Then for a day his Ashes repose
<br>After increase the fire warily
<br>For twenty hours that no fume appear
<br>But Crystal Pearl stick on the Glass most clear.
<p>9. In Porphyry Mortar beat this matter small
<br>Powder on that Sulphur which was last distilled
<br>Moderately feeding till imbibed it be all
<br>Which for four days in strong Athanor being boiled
<br>Is our great Lunary and Balsam radical
<br>Sulphur of nature and true mercurial.
<p>10. Dissolve this Sulphur philosophical
<br>In rectified Spirit taught before
<br>Close them in Pelican Hermetical
<br>To circulate that two they seem no more
<br>This our Azure water Celestial
<br>Dissolve Gold to last perpetual.
<p>11. From Marian and Salt Nitre may distill
<br>By easy heat a Spirit Mercurial
<br>A Sulphureous Oil by stronger fire come will
<br>And fixed Salt of Salt Original
<br>By force of fire yet will beneath remain
<br>And thus three Salts extracted are from twain.
<p>12. Which fixed Salt within his Limbeck lies
<br>Yield until him Mercury again
<br>Two days digest extract the phlegm aside
<br>And volatile with fixed that will remain
<br>Treble the fixed that it flight may take
<br>Sublime thy Sal Armoniack them to make.
<p>13. Within this Limbeck close the cover sure
<br>Increase the heat after 3 hours space
<br>In highest degree let it stand 6 hours more
<br>Receive the flower of Salt come through the glass
<br>Whose orient colours no man well can know
<br>The fixed foeces Whiter lie than Snow.
<p>14. Powder these Pearls and put on Sulphur Oil
<br>Which Liquor first let putrified be
<br>Then for a space together let them boil
<br>Till fixed melting like to wax you see
<br>This is the Soul or man the Spirit to join
<br>That from his body never more will twine.
<p>15. Behold the earth with fatness doth abound
<br>By virtue of Nitres two flying Spirits
<br>By sublimation falling on the ground
<br>The growing substance Quickening life inherits
<br>This is our Balsam and Fire Natural
<br>Nitre from Sulphur Armoniack mercurial.
<p>16. From Pitch lees sharp oil strong fire extract
<br>Let foeces dry with phlegm 3 fingers cover
<br>Six days in bath digest in water red, in act
<br>Have drawn the Tincture; put fresh, then cover,
<br>Digest, extract in all points as before
<br>Until the waters be coloured no more.
<p>17. Calcine the Sulphur, fixed Salt to gain
<br>Which oft dissolve congeal with his own phlegm
<br>When Crystalline in snow it doth remain
<br>Imbibe him with his Airy Spirit of phlegm
<br>The Watery substance then distil away
<br>The Volatile with fixed Salt may stay.
<p>18. And when you shall exceed the same threefold
<br>By Fire sublime the foliate Earth to gain
<br>Clearer than Pearl and richer than fine Gold
<br>And yield to him his Sulphureous oil again
<br>Join 3 in one which is our Leaven Tree
<br>First branch whereof we call Antimony.
<p>19. The balm of Gold his mercury is such
<br>It purgeth men, the Sulphur of the same
<br>Will Silver Gold till trial of the touch
<br>Which put in fire yet it will take no flame
<br>Within the flowers doth the Salt abide
<br>Purging by vomit when it shall be tried.
<p>20. The Mercury of this Antimony
<br>Devouring Luna may well be called
<br>Swallowing up Gold in his custody
<br>Killing the Quick, again of Life installed
<br>And this our Quicksilver is original
<br>Of crude Quicksilver and all Mineral.
<p>21. The Radical moisture fountain clear
<br>Where Vulcan washed Venus at the sea
<br>So clear that no impure spot appear
<br>But shine as brightly by night as Sun by day
<br>This precious Liquor is so rare a thing
<br>Which health and wealth into our state will bring.

<p>1. Of White and Red first was I bred, and Menstrue did me feed
<br>Now am but much like a Stone, but am no Stone indeed.
<br>I lay like Slime shut for a time, heat changed my former shape.
<br>I was a fine as any twine when first in womb I laye.
<br>In darkness prest, I long did rest before I came to light.
<br>Then grew I big, as does the twig, with puissant strength and might.
<p>2. Then mark we well, for down I fell, as each thing has his time.
<br>Now cast away, as filthy clay, which was at first but slime.
<br>So loathsome sure, few will endure me in their hands to hold,
<br>But yet the wise, me not despise, they think me rich as Gold.
<br>Can you not tell then? Mark now well from whence I first was sought.
<p>3. From Paradise so say the Wise, that Adam first me brought.
<br>Now where I dwell I shall you tell, and where you may me find,
<br>I am in thee that readest me, this note bear well in mind.
<br>With letters three you may name me, and in three me divide
<br>By fires might, which in your sight, these three are Quickly spied.
<p>4. An oil first mark, or Water dark, will seem as red as blood,
<br>A Salt will fly, and soar on high Quite separate from the flood
<br>These 3 in One, we call our Stone, our Chaos which doth hold
<br>As we do read, the perfect Seed of Silver and of Gold.
<br>You must divide and set aside the Earth from Water and Air,
<br>To dry the mud by heat is good till then to touch forbear.
<br>The outward heat hath wrought this heat by help of inward fire,
<br>The which did fry to powder dry this muddy Earth our Mire
<br>On which you shall let Water fall and dry the same again,
<br>This as I say, is called our Clay and Water of the Mine,
<br>This is our Toad which here is showed, that drinks the grapes so fast.
<p>5. Until he swells, as Ripley tells, till all his bowels brast.
<br>Being of such might, he devouring as is said;
<br>For Waters all drink up he shall, which then is called our Lead
<br>Here naught I fain, but teacheth you plain the first work of the 3.
<br>I show our Stone, to every one that will advised be.
<br>At the next birth, our foliate earth, I purpose to declare,
<br>Until which time, I cease to Rhyme, and wish you to forbear.

<p><b>Of True Principles.</b>
<p>1. Wise Geber, Hermes, Raymond and the rest
<br>Of grave Philosophers so darkly wrote
<br>To none but Sons, this Secret they exprest
<br>For Ignorants they understood it not.
<br>They want the Principles of Natures ground,
<br>For by expense this Art is never found.
<p>2. In Vegetables and Animals of kind
<br>Which stranger be from Nature of Metal
<br>True Principles of this Art is hard to find
<br>Common Vitriol we do expel
<br>Sulphur nor Common Quicksilver we use
<br>For we from Metals do our subjects choose.
<p>3. But he which hath a wit most natural
<br>A searching spirit into natures ground
<br>And follows Nature in her actions all
<br>Not reading much which will the sense confound
<br>By his own reason he may well confine
<br>How Nature frames the Metal in the Mine.
<p>4. Metal threefold within their roots we find
<br>Far off a mine and some more nearer be
<br>If thou canst wash the Sulphur and calcine
<br>With Salt and Vinegar orderly
<br>Knowing in Metal our Matter is contained
<br>Sulphur and Mercury is all Wise men meaned.
<p>5. Sulphur alone can never Metals make
<br>But if he joined be with his Argent-vive
<br>Congealation and Fixation will they take
<br>Preparing Sulphur thou shalt see believe
<br>That many skins above there shall appear
<br>Which in short time will grow dry, white and clear.
<p>6. For engendering metal and Elixir eke,
<br>The Sulphur as the father it is
<br>The Mercury the Woman Menstrue like
<br>Art imitating Nature oft in this
<br>And in the Work doth Nature overcome
<br>There are out Principles both all and some.
<p>7. A double fume doth penetrate our Stone
<br>Wherein the Sulphur privily doth lurk
<br>And mix itself with Mercury alone
<br>And are decocted there by Natures Work
<br>Where she converts them to a Metal pure
<br>Learn nature’s Secret and then keep it pure.
<p>8. When first the vapours shall be lifted high
<br>And descend into an Earth Rose Red
<br>To common Quicksilver they turned shall be
<br>From imperfect Metals Vitriols are bred.
<br>The Sulpureous species prepared right
<br>Are turned to Mercury, Sol and Luna bright.
<p>9. This is the Seed whence Metals do begin
<br>And of diversity of mine or place
<br>And of the Sulphur pure or not washt clean
<br>Are Metals altered, some fine some base,
<br>These accidents from radical Seed take
<br>And then thou mayst the true Elixir make.
<p>10. In Metalline bodys are Sulphurs twain
<br>And their Mercury by calcinations
<br>Which was a Salt and to Salt is turned again
<br>Of a true Calx the kind and fashion
<br>Sulphur and mercury give fixation
<br>Within the Earth by long Conversion.
<p>11. Our <i>Arsenick</i> doth of these participate
<br>Wherefore Hermaphrodite we do it call
<br>But of itself no Metal may beget
<br>Our Tin and Lead are Salts ethereal
<br>Mars and Venus two fumes from Sulphur rise
<br>The which from Vitriol dissolved comes.
<p>13. White fume a red within his belly bearing
<br>Hath no actual Nature of Element
<br>Called a Boar a Lion fierce and tearing
<br>Being indeed our true Quintessence
<br>The Copper Mine is Salt which Saturn call
<br>But Saturn is our Chaos holding all.
<p>14. Perfect bodys dissolve into Water
<br>Are Sulphureous species clean prepared
<br>For fixed bodys are hard Salts in Nature
<br>Which we make flying and the flying fixed
<br>Again the manifest we hide from sight
<br>And which lay hid we bring again to Light.
<p>15. From Foeces burnt our mercury we draw
<br>Multiplication with which must be
<br>Mark well this Secret following Natures Law
<br>And many Wonders art thou like to see
<br>But first prepare then fix, last multiply,
<br>And these three orders follow warily.
<p>16. Our Stone as King which in himself is rich
<br>Wants nothing which to it doth appertain
<br>Geber talks much of marchasites by which
<br>Our Stone of Philosophers he doth mea
<br>Which Elixir we call, being Mineral
<br>And also Vegetable and Animal.
<p>17. In this our Stone consisteth all our skill
<br>Using a natural preparation
<br>In it is Gold and Silver to his fill
<br>Not common but spiritual in action
<br>This Gold is Potable and Radical
<br>Humidity of Sulphur called the Soul.
<p>18. Our Aqua Vitae from our Stone descends
<br>And many Liquor we extract from thence,
<br>Among the which some wash and some do cleanse
<br>Some do congeal and some are a defence
<br>That fire do not vitrify our Stone
<br>And thus we make use of every one.
<p>19. Black, blacker than black we do our Sulphur call
<br>When he grows black in calcinations.
<br>But divers colours before White do fall
<br>And when Citrine and lastly a Carnation
<br>It is Blackness doth endure 40 days
<br>Forty in Whiteness and 40 the Ted wise.
<p>20. Elixir doth itself coagulate
<br>Formed like an Egg but that his shell is tender
<br>From it take nought nor add to his estate
<br>Break not the shell for loss of spirits tender
<br>But nourish it with heat till at the last
<br>Extracted Colours all be gone and past.
<p>21. The Poets hid this Art in fables dark
<br>Under Hercules and Anthces Power
<br>Preparation of Sulphur how to work
<br>By Jupiter turned to a Golden Shower
<br>They teach the distillation of our Gold
<br>Which Wise Men for a Secret great did hold.
<p>22. By Minerva armed we do understand
<br>that Water distilled, which Water of Sulphur is
<br>By Vulcan flowing Minerva armed
<br>Is Sulphur following the water of his
<br>And in his Salt in putrifaction
<br>Which congeals all by fires action.
<p>23. By Mars our Sulphur they do plainly show
<br>By Tin our Air, and oft our earth they mean
<br>By the Phoenix which always doth receive we know
<br>Our Elixir how to multiply certain
<br>By Demergogous Tale we bring to life
<br>Which is the Secret that s not so rife.
<p>24. Thus Poets all their works in fables fained
<br>Because the Art should never be attained.

<p><b>A Brief Parabolical Description of the Stone.</b>
<p>Though Daphne fly from Phoebus bright, yet shall they both be one,
<br>And is you understand this right you have our hidden Stone.
<br>For Daphne she is fair and white but volatile is she.
<br>Phoebus a fixed God of might and Red as blood is he.
<br>Daphne is a Water Nymph and hath of moisture store,
<br>Which Phoebus doth consume with heat and drys her very sore.
<br>They being dryed into one, of Crystal flood must drink
<br>Till they be brought to a White Stone which wash with Virgins milk.
<br>So long until they flow as wax and no fume you can see,
<br>Then you have all you need to ask --- praise God and thankful be.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Verum Verissimum.</b>
<br><b>The True Work.</b>
<p>Wise men will read seek and seek in this latter age
<br>But miss to find for which too sore they sought.
<br>Time, Goods, lost spent have put some in a rage
<br>To seek the Thing which will cost right nought
<br>A piece of Earth congealed by Natures might
<br>Much like a Stone, but is no stone in sight.
<p>Prepare this substance to dissolve with fire
<br>From whence three things at once by heat will rise
<br>Of which three pints the Wise men did desire
<br>To which they put a Salt congealed like ice
<br>And then these four things did distill again
<br>Whence Salt with Oil dissolved did rise with rain.
<p>Fire natural with Seed of Gold in Oil
<br>Remains below which we dry up to dust
<br>In out Athanor we continually boil
<br>Which dry Clay moisten often times we must
<br>For oft we grind, imbibe, bury and dry
<br>In which the Stone doth kindly putrify.
<p>This Lead dissolve like butter somewhat soft,
<br>Dissolve in Balneo what will thence arise.
<br>When fire of Sand will rise two fumes aloft
<br>A White, and Red, called <i>Arsenick</i> of the Wise.
<br>The Faeces black, calcine in fire you may
<br>Till they be White or else look somewhat Grey.
<p>In thirteen weeks this Earth thou White shall see
<br>Wherein three parts of water knit shall be
<br>These fixed Bodies volatile shall be
<br>If this first Water on again you put
<br>To cover it in a small quantity
<br>Digest in sand on night the head on shut.
<p>In Balneo distil the water weak away
<br>But volatile with fixed Salt will stay
<br>Continue this till Water loose his might
<br>And that the Earth increased be threefold,
<br>By heat sublime, comes Sal Armoniack bright
<br>More richer far than any Indian Gold.
<p>This White leaved Earth, divide it into two
<br>And in one part the Soul again must grow
<br>This Soul is Arsenic which likewise divide
<br>From greatest part sever, the white from Red
<br>Into fixed Oils with fire let them be fried
<br>Which are the Lights, true Leavens for our Bread.
<p>For when the Soul and Body be made on
<br>These are the Lights which must ferment our Stone
<br>The foliate earth which did behind remain
<br>Dissolve in bath and make our Virgin Milk
<br>The which must feed our Infant born again
<br>Till be he strong to wear a suit of silk.
<p>Then with our Gold and Silver set in order
<br>Let him be guarded with an Orient border.

<p><b>Carmina Lapidis</b>
<br><b>Out of an Old Written Book.</b>
<p>This World is in a Maze and what you why
<br>Forsooth of late a great rich man did die
<br>And as he lay dying on his bed
<br>These words in secret to his son he said
<br>My Son, Quoth he, ‘tis good for thee I die
<br>For thou shall much the better be thereby
<br>And when thou seest life hath me bereft
<br>Take thou what thou findest and where I have it left
<br>Thou dost not know, nor what my riches be
<br>All which I will declare, give ear to me
<br>An Earth I had all venome to expel
<br>And that I cast into a mighty well
<br>A Water eke to cleanse what was amiss
<br>I threw into the Earth and there it is
<br>My Silver all into the Sea I cast
<br>My Gold into Air and then at last
<br>Into the fire for fear it should be found
<br>I threw a Stone, worth forty thousand pound
<br>Which Stone was given me by a mighty King
<br>Who bade me wear it in a fair gold ring
<br>Quoth he, this Stone is by that Ring found out
<br>If wisely thou canst turn the ring about
<br>For every hoop contrary is to other
<br>Yet well agree and of the Stone is Mother
<br>And now my Son I will declare a Wonder
<br>That when I die this ring will break asunder
<br>The King said so but yet he said withal
<br>Although the Ring be broken in pieces small
<br>An easy fire shall soon it close again
<br>Who this can do he needs not work in vain.
<br>Till this my hidden treasure be found out
<br>When I am dead my Spirit shall walk about
<br>And stay with him till you may riches have.
<br>Make him to bring you fire from the Grave.
<br>These words a worldly man did chance to hear
<br>Who daily watched the Spirit, but neer the neere
<br>And yet it met him and every one
<br>Yet tells him not where is this hidden Stone.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Microcosmus.</b>
<p>The adamical matter we may understand to be
<br>The pains of this most little World wherein we plainly see
<br>All things that needful are and nothing overplus
<br>Our fiery Mercury it is by Art prepared thus
<br>The true Hermaphrodite Adam and the true little World
<br>The which among the Wisest men so highly is extold
<br>When Corporal Salt with Waters Quick our Spiritual Mercury
<br>And Sulphur animate be mixt and joined naturally.
<br>Then Nature doth begin to work by her separating fire
<br>By which impure Sulphur is divided from the pure
<br>And earth from Salt is separated likewise and Mercury
<br>From the faintest Water of the Clouds as Nature can devise
<br>Again decoct these pure parts into a body pure
<br>In the which Soul and Spirit both are fixed firm and sure.
<br>This is the only milk and Stone which nourisheth our King
<br>Fro the which union again our Mercury doth spring
<br>Mercury Philosophical, not common of the mine
<br>But our accidental is, which will with bodys join
<br>For being fixed it father is of wonders great and small
<br>It is both body and spirit which we Magnesia call
<br>But our first composition of earth parts and dry
<br>The body of Magnesia we call it certainly.
<br>But when Quicksilver we do join in bodys to congeal
<br>Magnesia we do call it, this rule may never fail.
<br>Our Stone being raw we water call wherein contained is
<br>Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus our filth of Silver cleaned
<br>Which being in Quicksilver, Magnesia I do mean
<br>White Sulphur we do call it but being boiled red
<br>Is Gold, Coral, and <i>Orpiment</i> and Leaven for our bread.
<br>Boil, grind, and wash the body cleanse and make his hardness mesh
<br>His fiery Tincture hide which is his Soul and flesh
<br>Must in another spirit rest for it is life not dying
<br>Which to another body join and they will both be flying
<br>That is our Mercury sublimed of Air and fire Light
<br>United both in wedlocke band and made our Sulphur bright,
<br>Mercury, Salt, Sulphur spring all from one rock and mine
<br>Fix Salt and Sulphur to congeal Mercury not to twine
<br>In them is such affinity in spermating aright
<br>The Agent body Lune I mean and Mercury his Light
<br>Which patient is the nutriment which Menstrus we do call
<br>It is the Salt of Almebrot the which congealeth all
<br>And doth revive the dead from death into a lively Stone
<br>By means of Water ‘tis born nurst by decoction
<br>The Spirits they will ne’er dwell in bodys foul and hard
<br>Till they calcined to dust be with simple spirits prepared.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A Problem.</b>
<p>Behold the thing which Quiets every mind
<br>Which many seek but very few can find
<br>Here view the dead where Nature can no more
<br>Work on her Corps as she hath done before
<br>The Last of birth is first of Joys: the Cause
<br>And first of Joys is last of Natures Laws
<br>When first and last by Art is wisely framed
<br>Then shalt thou see the Bear and Lyon tamed
<br>The flying Dragon and the Serpent lurking,
<br>In Waters wild shall close be set to working
<br>If this my verse be dark unto thy sight
<br>And then in scenes it nothing the delight
<br>Then in good truth set all thy works apart
<br>And trouble not thyself with this our Art
<br>For if thou be bit of a pregnant wit
<br>Thy humour right for that they plainly show
<br>The Mine where Gold and Silver both do grow
<br>And eke the way to work and bring to pass
<br>As Nature in the mine, so in the Glass;
<br>With Equal heat continuing to the end
<br>Thy Precious Stone with little charge to spend

<p><b>The Philosophers Brass.</b>
<p>Our Golden Tincture springs from bodys four
<br>Where Souls called Sulphurs lie hid with their Power
<br>First earthy bodies joined to our bras do call
<br>Our body of Magnesia name you shall
<br>But when the spirits be congealed with Clay
<br>And putrified Magnesia call you may
<br>But in the time of Putrifaction
<br>Call it you may the Philosophers Saturn
<br>When Quicksilver is in the body congealed
<br>By grinding washing and boiling is prevailed
<br>Then bodys soft pure and subtil are found
<br>Quicksilver burning bodys in one bound
<br>The Soul our Tincture is in other spirit hid
<br>And spirit to another body is wed
<br>Our fiery poison bringing this to pass
<br>Being decocted long within our glass
<br>Till bodys be like butter or like brain
<br>Or that the spirit will ascend again
<br>With gentle fire then sublime the Soul
<br>Which will ascend fro the dregs corporeal
<br>By Art make part of this Quicksilver red,
<br>Divide in two parts to stand thee in stead,
<br>Mix one part with those things due of our brass
<br>Dissolve congeal them all within the glass
<br>The second part is food to feed this youth
<br>At 7 times we give it meat for truth
<br>Two parts of brass in tables beaten small
<br>Full seven parts of venom add you shall
<br>This Sea Water with very gentle fire
<br>Dissolve the bodys to our own desire.
<br>But when you see that blackness shall appear
<br>The bodys then be molten without fear
<br>In which Sea Water boiling fort days
<br>A Flower of White Salt to the top will rise
<br>Most shining white to sight it will appear
<br>Congealed by heat our white Stone called Air.
<br>If one of three parts Water you congeal
<br>And keep two parts of Water you do well
<br>This foresaid Compound being white and dry
<br>By strong fire it into ashes fry
<br>Which then will shine like ashes somewhat green
<br>Seven times dissolve it and congeal again
<br>With Mercury reserved before
<br>And to this I need not to write more.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Heaven of the Philosophers.</b>
<p>Our Heaven yieldeth to each growing thing
<br>Both moisture, dryness, heat and chilling cold
<br>For that our Stars such influence Forth do bring
<br>Saturn and Luna, cold and moist spirits hold.
<br>But Sol and Mars have spirits hot and dry
<br>Jovalls hot and moist these bear rule on high.
<p>Our fixed Salt which is our heavens ground
<br>Whose Diamond circles glistening from the sky
<br>Are shining fires and burning Comets round
<br>From Sulpureous Substance which flame and dry
<br>Which in mercurial Spirits shine so clear
<br>Proceeding from the Substance of the Air.
<p>Sulphur in flame, and mercury in wind
<br>Earth volatile gives Air taste sharp and sour
<br>Which Sulphur Salt and Mercury we find
<br>From whence the Air her influence doth pour
<br>Within the thunderbolt is Salt full fixed
<br>Thus, in the Air all three be duly mixed.
<p>From crystal clouds of Heaven doth descend
<br>A water weak, from water doth distill
<br>A subtil Air, mercurial Liquors send
<br>The Waters gross which Sulphureous parts did fill
<br>Our penetrating Air more gross of spirit
<br>Then do our Earthly Mercuries inherit.
<p>The Elemental bodies visible
<br>Appear in two, one moist the other dry
<br>A Sandy Earth, deprived of taste or smell
<br>Unsavory phlegm from whence Quick spirits fly
<br>There two, the passive having lost the strength
<br>And so is Air deprived of force at length.
<p>The Elements their active Qualities
<br>To Mercury Salt and Sulphur do pertain
<br>The passive to their bodies in like wise
<br>And so Salt Sulphur and Mercury do remain
<br>Which by an Oil are joined all in one
<br>And Water, Air and Earth by Water alone
<p>Thus by a mean we see a Conjunction made
<br>As Sand and Water by a fatty Lime
<br>Thus makes the Dauber Mortar by his trade
<br>So Air and Earth by Water well do join
<br>And fire extracted as from other three
<br>Quickening the Principals when one there be.
<p>A fourth Essence this Air, fire we call
<br>From form and Matter of ye Elements three
<br>Which is the Soul that animated all
<br>The bodies of our Principles that be
<br>Colours to forms belong this Spirit and Soul
<br>And Elements clean unto Matter corporal.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Proportions.</b>
<p>On fixed bodies fix our Sulphurs twain
<br>But first prepare our ferments pure and thin
<br>To nourish youth by Quick corrosion
<br>And to his Nature bring the Sulphur in.
<br>This Sulphur enters Nature by a mean
<br>Of his own Water which it doth retain.
<p>So in Waters dissolve our Sulphur first
<br>That into bodies it may better mix
<br>Then into ferment thrice dissolve to dust
<br>And by often iteration will our Sulphur fix
<br>Boil Air and Mercury not fixed thereon
<br>That both may take a fit impression.
<p>Let ferment white three times his Sulphur bear
<br>And earth must equal Air and Water or more
<br>As two of Water one and half of Air
<br>And three and half of earth or less than four.
<br>Fix Water on earth and Air on Water
<br>Then shalt thou have a perfect Matter
<p>But to thy Gold let Earth two parts suffice
<br>Of Water three as much of Air do take
<br>One part and half of fire if thou be wise
<br>Let weight of Fire half the Water make
<br>If Colour want add Medicine as before
<br>If too much Color then put Matter more.
<p>Grind three parts Silver with Mercury six
<br>One part white Sulphur with his Water
<br>With one part more water likewise let him mix
<br>Then with strong fire sublime both anon
<br>And that which on the Vessel clear shall shine
<br>With his own Water pour on dregs of Wine.
<p>Grind seeth and roast till pap it be mixed
<br>Again sublime it doing as before
<br>Reiterate this work till earth be fixed
<br>With twice his weight of Water and no more,
<br>Then in like sort by drops with Air it fed
<br>With gentle fire when it shall need.
<p>And in this sort fix all this Air you may
<br>Both day and night with fire then strong it bake
<br>Let fire increase the second night and day
<br>But in the third the stronger fire make
<br>This substance feed upon a vehement fire
<br>Till like to wax it melt to your desire.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A Declaration of the First matter with the Order of the Work,</b>
<br><b>The Name of the Author and His Profession.</b>
<p>Even as the rocks which bind thy solid Earth,
<br>Doth Microcosme in itself contain
<br>Worlds coin the lees which bringeth forth a birth,
<br>Adamical Matter foul and unclean
<br>Rectify this as nature doth us guide
<br>Distil, Calcine, and Earth from Air divide.
<p>Mesh oft thy womb with oil, water and air,
<br>Oft dry and grind till earth have drunk up all,
<br>Which done dissolve again this earth to clear
<br>Even as before distil that which will fall,
<br>Let faeces black calcined be by fire,
<br>Like to burnt Salt but in colour somewhat higher.
<p>Or cover this with his first water bright
<br>Four fingers over place it then in sand
<br>Distil again till water loose his might
<br>And be as faint as water of the Land
<br>And this continue till increase you again
<br>Fourfold at least and then sublime again.
<p>The foliate earth which is our fire will rise
<br>Over the head and hang as white as snow
<br>Receive this flower that’s honoured of the Wise

<br>But foliate Earth and <i>Arsenick</i> to conclude,
<br>Of which by long concoction we do frame
<br>A Powder Red which Elixir name.
<br>Aurum Potabile we do it call
<br>When into oil it is dissolved all
<br>But to divide our Chaos in his kind
<br>In Genesis or Esdras you shall find
<br>Water and Air from Earth God first did take
<br>Then muddy earth with fire did dry and bake
<br>Within which Earth all treasures hid do lie
<br>But Air as Wind about the Earth did fly
<br>Unto the which I fitly may compare
<br>The scoffs of such as here mentioned are.
