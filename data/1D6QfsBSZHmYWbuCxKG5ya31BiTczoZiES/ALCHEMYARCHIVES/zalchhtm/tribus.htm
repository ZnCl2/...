<p>Take good crude antimony and native orpiment 1/4 lb or as much as you
like. Powder each finely by itself, and mix the powders. Beware of the
dust.
<p>Put the mixture in a globe glass with a long neck. Place your glass
deeply buried in the sand, so that the best part of the globe is under
the sand, but the whole neck remains free. Your furnace must stand under
a chimney. Then light your fire which increase gradually. After the humidity
has evaporated, put a bit of soft clay upon the opening of the neck of
the glass and press it in gently.
<p>Increase your fire, until the sand and glass grow so intensely hot,
that the powders melt together in the globe.
<p>When you see this let the substance continue melting until the whole
has become of a fine deep red fluid massa. At the later end of the operation,
the iron sand pot must become red hot in the bottom.
<p>When you have obtained the red fluid mass in fusion, take the fire out
immediately, that the glass may cool gradually.
<p>The next day, break the glass and you will find a fine red transparent
ruby glass, called Lapis de Tribus because it consists of antimony, arsenic,
and sulphur.
<p>Note – Of you admit the air into the neck of the glass, the mixture
takes fire, and you run great risk of your life; therefore be careful.
It is done in 4 hours time. This glass is very volatile.
<p>(I have given you some of it in a red powder, which, if you melt, it
becomes a red glass again.)
<p>One W. Cornelius de Winter from Amsterdam who was in London about the
year 1775 comunicated this and what to do with it to W. Lantz.
<p>Cornelius de Winter working the process of Myriam prophetissa, not as
she told her process to Aros, King of Egypt, but in the following manner,
had attained a tinging powder upon silver, as he told W. Lentz, and recommended
this to him, until he should fid something of greater consequence, and
W. Lentz gave it to me. I have never tried it.
<p>The Process of Cornelius de Winter with te foregoing Lapis de Tribus
for the Short Way.
<p>Take3iv of Lapis de Tribus in powder and 3J of fine gold in leaves.
Mix these in a mortar by rubbing. Let it melt together in a covered crucible
and suffer no coals to drop in. When the crucible begins to grow red hot,
the mixture melts and at last inflamed, and the Lapis de Tribus fumes away
and evaporates. When you find the Lapis evaporated, take the crucible out
and let it cool, but do not breathe the poisonous fumes.
<p>Take the gold calx out. Weigh it and mix it anew with 4 parts of fresh
powdered Lapid de Tribus, by rubbing it in a glass. Put the mixture into
a new crucible. Melt again and keep it in the fire, until the Lapis de
Tribus is again evaporated. Repeat the same operation, with 4 parts of
fresh Lapis and your gold calx is well opened for a further operation.
<p>Cornelius de Winter said to W. Lentz, ‘You may proceed in this manner
with silver, copper, or iron, and open and volatilize them by means o the
Lapis de Tribus, sooner than the gold, and not that one single melting
of four parts of the lapis to open part of fin silver in leaves, or of
a Crocus Martis, or Veneris, opens and greatly volatilizes silver, iron
or copper in one single operation. You are also to not that you fire must
not be excited by the blast. It must not be a melting, but only a calcining
fire. Otherwise your volatilized metals fl out of the crucible, and you
keep the empty nest’.
<p>The Lapis de Tribus has a power to volatilize all metals, gold and silver
not excepted, either by the first, second or third operation, according
to their natural volatility or fixity, and highly subtilizes them and reduces
them into a mercurial principle, which mercurialized metals can be employed
in labors of great consequence, as experience will teach you. I tell you
the truth, but beware of the mercurial fumes.
<p>‘I have made a Tincture in Via Sicca from this foundation, more than
once at Amsterdam, and although it acts only on a few parts of silver,
yet it is very profitable, as it can be accomplished very well in 3 or
4 days’ time, but this is not the brass founder’s work, by any means’,
said de Winter.
<p>Take of the whitest and clearest river pebbles you can get, a pound
or more, and powder them finely in a clean iron mortar, and sift your powder
perfectly fine.
<p>Of this fine pebble powder, take 3/4 lb, and good yellow litharge powdered
and sifted, one lb. Mix the two powders. Put them into a new crucible covered,
and melt the mixture to a glass in the wind furnace. When done take the
crucible out and let it cool. When cold, break the crucible and powder
your glass and sift it.
<p>Now take one part of Lapis de Tribus in powder and mix it with 4 parts
of the pebble glass by rubbing them well together in a glass mortar. Melt
these substances in a new crucible for 5 or 6 hours, so as to keep the
matter in constant fusion. Then take the crucible out, break it, and when
cold, poweder it, and your glass will look tinged with yellow or orange.
Weigh it, and mix it again, 4 parts of this tinged glass with one part
of fresh de Tribus. Melt again, in a new crucible constantly covered, for
5 or 6 hours. You can very well accomplish 2 meltings in a day. Repeat
this a third time, and your obtained glass ought to be of a fine orange
colour. This is already a kind of Tincture, which if you melt it with silver,
it enriches the silver with atoms of fine gold, and if you separates such
silver with aqua fortis, the black calx, which falls, when washed, dried,
and melted with borax, proves to be fine gold of 24 carats, but this is
not all.
<p>Take your orange coloured opaque glass, weigh it, and powder and sift
it. Take of this 4 parts, say drachms, in proportion, as you have opened
gold, which you have prepared at first, one part or drachm of fresh Lapis
de Tribus, and one 3 of your opened mercurialized gold, and mix the whole
diligently in a porphyry or glass mortar. You must rub full 2 hours, and
do not breathe the dust. Melt this composition in a new covered crucible
during 6 hours continual fusion, yet without any blast or violence, as
fusion is enough.
<p>When the time is past, take out the pot and let it cool. Break the crucible
and separate the glass, which does now look of a deeper red, like a new
brick.
<p>Powder and weigh this glass. Take thereof 4 parts, and add one part
of fresh lapis de Tribus in powder. Mix the two powders diligently and
melt them again in a new covered crucible for 6 hours time, keeping the
matter in constant fusion. When cold, you will find your glass deeper in
colour than before.
<p>Repeat this fusion a third time (which from the beginning, is now the
sixth melting, adding to 4 parts of this red glass, one part of fresh Lapis
de Tribus and proceed carefully, as you did before, but Note: ---
<p>1. If any coals fall into the pot, the operation is spoiled, which has
happened to me in the beginning:
<p>2. By the repeated fusions and fixations by the violent way, adding
each time a 1/5 part of fresh Lapis de Tribus, i.e., one part of the lapis
to 4 parts of the fixed glass, your tinged glass becomes more and more
penetrating, more fusible ad more fixed.
<p>I durst not go beyond 6 or 7 fusions, as the glass does at last run
through the pores of the red hot crucible. In this manner I once lost all
my treasure.
<p>6 or 7 fusions may be safely done.
<p>This red glass is a genuine Tincture upon fine silver. After 6 fusions,
it tinges sometimes 10, sometimes 12, sometimes 20 parts of silver in fusion
into fine gold of 24 carats. I could never make it twice alike, the reason
of which I cannot penetrate. It is profitable enough, but no so profitable,
as Myriam said to King Aros. At least I could never find it so.
