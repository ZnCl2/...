  <a name="ep"></a>
  <p>Various have been the Opinions (Courteous Reader) concerning the
Basis
and Foundation of this general Dissolvent, commonly known by the name
of
the Liquor Alkahest; some imagining it to be Mercury prepared; others,
that &#8216;tis in Urine, Blood and the like; which has been the reason of so
many and difficult labors made use of, and all in vain: for that the
Liquor
remains at this day as great a Secret in the World as ever, and &#8216;tis
like
so to continue while Chemical authors Deliver the subject in such
tropes
and Metaphors, which horrible and Inextricable labyrinth the young
Tyros
are so entangled in, that it must be by more than an ordinary
Providence,
that he can be disentangled and set free. </p>
  <p>On this account it may be properly said, that these Chemical
Writers
had as good to have been silent; nay, it would have been better! For
then
so many would not have engaged in a search, where so little likelihood
of obtaining was seen whereby a great deal of Precious Time and Money
might
have been saved, and that Perplexity of mind which follows vain
Chemical
Processes might have been prevented; for this Reason it is but just in
Authors in all their discourses, tending to the instruction of others,
to direct to that Subject which is the true object of that discourse;
and
though I must acknowledge that it is not fit to be delivered or
disclosed
so plainly, as that every Hog that may come to the Honey Pot, yet I say
that it maybe clothed with such a decent habit, as to preserve it
abstruse
enough, yet by this a certain and harmonious Concord to be seen; as for
example, the Object of this discourse is the Alkahest. Man and all
creatures
have it, for there is no being in Nature, that is rightly and genuinely
dissolved, but what may properly and truly be said to be done by this
Liquor,
but particularly in man after a more evident manner in all
Chylifications
whatever, but in this Act Man sucks the Quintessence of all things so
dissolved
for his own Nutrition and being Transmuted into Human Species, the
Recrements
are cast off by the common Emunctories, far more gross and imperfect,
than
the Species themselves were in their first Reception, consequently they
are of no fit object to ground the discourse of so pure and Immortal a
dissolvent on; not indeed Man himself, though we grant that it is
plentiful
in him, but it is that Salt or Life in him which Concentrates all other
Salts in his own Essence as a Catholic Fountain for all the Rivulets to
be supplied from. So that there is no taking of it from him but by a
violent
breaking of the Glass and a Transplanting of the Fountain back again to
that Inexhaustible Ocean from whence it first received its being.
Therefore,
man cannot be the Object of any discourse appertaining to demonstrate
the
Subject of this Dissolvent; for the pure in him, as already said,
cannot
be obtained without Death, which is abominable even to think on; but if
it were obtained, it would not answer the end; for what is sufficient
to
dissolve in the Vegetable Kingdom is too weak for the Animal; and that
which is strong enough in the Animal is too weak for the Minerals.
Therefore,
seek it in that and from that, which is the Fountain, that supplies all
Creatures and beings with it; for had it not a Source, Nature would
soon
cease, for as she exhausts by the acts of Motion and Agitation of Parts
in Generation, so is she on the other hand Immediately Supplied, not
only
in the Great World, but also in every Individual Part where Life is:
Receiving
the same through the Air, as the true Vehicle, consequently this
Catholic
Fountain is the Right object to ground this discourse on, as the true
Subject
of the said dissolving Liquor; this is a standing Truth, it was Truth
in
the beginning, and will remain so to the end of Time. The Reason and
Philosophy
of it I can by Mechanical Demonstration make clear to a person worthy
of
such inspection: therefore by all Clouds, Dark Veils and metaphors, I
genuinely
declare that the matter of this Dissolvent is one and the same in
Essence
with that Matter from whence all the wise Ancients obtained the
Universal
Medicine, one being the Work of Art, the other Nature. One gentle, the
other violent: so that by the difference of Operation they are brought
to different effects. </p>
  <p>Now therefore the Subject of this discourse being the Liquor
Alkahest,
the Object must be the Universal Spirit; for it is from this grand
Fountain
of Nature that our Chaos doth proceed; therefore thrice happy is he,
that
knows those Magnets that attract and make a species of this general
Genus:
for he is assured that there is something more than Elements in all
Created
Beings, even an Incorruptible and Quintessential Spirit, which is the
very
Life of Elements themselves; which being taken appears in Mist, Vapor
or
Water, even that out of which the Ancients say all things were
Generated.
However, the right Knowledge of this Matter is sufficiently abstruse,
and
the Operations thereof yet more abstruse; for I with many others know
by
experience, that the Matter may be known and many do know it, yet are
wholly
to seek in the matter and Modus of Operating thereon; and whatever some
Foppish and Conceited ones may think, viz. that if they had the
Knowledge
of the true matter all difficulty is over; this may prove a grand
Mistake,
for I have been Intimately acquainted with some, that have had a true
knowledge
of the matter, and have wrought thereon; yet to the day of their Death,
have been to seek of the Magistery. </p>
  <p>These difficulties have been those sharp Stones that have hindered
by
Legal Progression in 20 years travel towards the Mount Helicon of Art;
so that my labor of Body has been excessive, and that of the mind much
more. I have passed through the drought and scorching heat of the Day,
and also through the cold and chilling Frost of the Night through a
multitude
of wants and difficulties even often to the Hazard of Life itself.
Howsoever
easy such, as aforesaid, may think it: I have had no other door to come
in at, but hard labor and great Expense, for Coals and Glasses have
been
my Interpreters, and shall be so to every true Son of the Art to the
end
of time. For Conscience&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll write the Truth as well knowing
that
there are too many Sophistical and false Processes in the world, which
will not bear the Touchstone of Experience; but vanishes like a
reprobate
Metal upon the Test. </p>
  <p>But passing by all this, and much more that might be said of the
like
Nature; I shall now address myself to the desirers of Wisdom, and let
them
know, that I have, as in a Glass, showed them the true manner, in which
and by which this Dissolvent is to be obtained. I shall now come to
speak
concerning its Use, and Utility when obtained which will abundantly
reward
the Possessor for all his Costs and Pains bestowed about it; for as it
hath been delivered, that the Subject of this Menstruum is Universal,
so
are the Acts of it the same when prepared, which plainly demonstrates
from
what Fountain it might flow. </p>
  <p>This Liquor, as an Universal Fire, dissolves and opens the
Textures
of all Beings, in the Vegetable, Animal and Mineral Kingdoms, not their
nearest matter, which is Saline, Sulphureous, Aqueous and Potable,
diffusive
in any Liquor, and so comes immediately to Nature&#8217;s Relief, and by the
Specific Virtue manifested from Power into Act, Diseases though never
so
deplorable, may be overcome and cut down, as Grass or Weeds with a
Scythe
in the Hand of a Mower; especially by those of the Mineral Kingdom,
which
may be justly esteemed the Physician&#8217;s Crown and Philosophers&#8217; Diadem.
This is the Liquor&#8217;s Virtue in General. In particular, as it
Universally
acts without Limitation on all Subjects in the World, so in this Action
there is something remarkable to be observed in every Subject; for it
fixes
Volatile Spirits, and Volatilizes Fixed ones. It makes Salts
sulphureous,
and Sulphurs saline. Nay, it macerates the Gummosities of Resinous and
Gummy things, which the Ferment of our Stomachs could never do; for it
being distilled from Amber and Turpentine leaves them in a salt of
excellent
Virtue: from the latter I have observed it almost as sweet as Honey,
and
a powerful Specific in the Stone; therefore by the help of this Liquor
of Fire a few Medicines being prepared will answer in deplorable Cases
all that the Patient can hope for and the true Physician expected to
perform.
For instance, Turpentine, so dissolved, infallibly Cures the Stone in
the
Bladder; Amber and Hellebore Hysteric Fits, Hypochondriac, Melancholy
and
Madness. Cinnamon, Unicorn&#8217;s Horn and the liver of an Eel, for the
speedy
delivery of Women in Childbirth; the sulphur of Venus is an Universal
nepenthes,
without Opium in all diseases: the lily of Antimony for Dropsies and
all
Agues; the Magistery of Gold for Malignant Fevers, Pestilential Palsies
and Plagues: as also the also the glorified Sulphur of the Metallus
Masculus,
by Paracelsus called Vinum Vitae and Membrorum Essentia, which also
cures
Consumption, fixt Mercury or the Arcanum Coralinum and Horizontal Gold
in Leprosies, Gout, Palsy, Epilepsy, Cancers, Wolves, Scorbute, King&#8217;s
Evil, all sorts of Venereal Disease without Salivation or detaining the
patient from business; it would be too long to enumerate all those
Medicines
prepared by this Fire or Liquor; therefore let these suffice, and the
reward
that may accrue here from, because by this way of Practice, the
Physician
may justly and Conscientiously gain honor and riches; and the Patients
be freed from all those cruel Barbarities, which are the Adequate Parts
of Common Practice; as if the Pain and Terror of Death were not enough,
but there must be an additional Cruelty, viz. of Blistering, which to
some
may exceed the former. </p>
  <p>Thus having given you a short Scheme of the Rise, Preparation and
Use
of this Liquor, I shall conclude this Preface in Consideration of a
Person
rightly qualified for the Possession hereof: the first and most
necessary
Qualifications is to be rightly Informed in Religious things so as to
know
God for themselves savingly, by passing through the Holy River of
Regeneration,
for to walk in the newness of the Spirit, which Divine gift of the Holy
Ghost enables every true Christian to walk with that Circumspection, as
to be acceptable in the sight of God, to such it is a sure Guide and
safe
Conductor in this World towards the desired Haven of rest. It is also
to
them a mouth and Wisdom, and that by which their Tongues are bridled
and
the whole Man sealed to the Day of his Redemption, giving an earnest of
the Eternal Inheritance, and afterwards a full Possession, when our
Mortal
shall put on Immortality; this being the Fountain, all others that are
true, flow as Rivulets from it, and so give a right Qualification for
the
Knowledge of Nature and Natural things as also a Constancy of mind to
work
upon the one thing alone, and an Industrious hand to effect the same.
Here
a Blessing and Success may be hope for, and those Incredible Rewards
for
all such as wander in the Circumference, and have never been admitted
to
the Center of things; but to the Vigilant hidden things, even those hid
from the foundation of the World, shall be revealed: and that this may
be the Portion of every true laborer in Art is the sincere Desire of
him,
who wishes the General Prosperity of Mankind every way. </p>

  <b><font size="+1">Concerning the Mistake of those who sought this
Liquor
in wrong Subjects and by wrong Ways.</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><a name="1"></a> </p>
  <p>It is a Saying worthy of Observation, that the Industrious Hand
makes
Rich; so is it in all manner of Trades and Convers in the World; so it
is in Art; but this Industry must be upon a tight Foundation, and, set
in the Chymical Art, from a Foreknowledge of Adequate Causes; unto
which
it is impossible to attain without we are enlightened by that Wisdom,
which
comes from above, as a Ray from the Holy Heavens and Throne of the
Divine
Glory; for it is she, that must Conduct us in all out Labors to make
them
Acceptable to the Great God; well therefore might the wise Man esteem
of
her before Riches, and Prizes Understanding above the Merchandise of
Silver,
Gold, and Precious Stones, because she is the true Conductor to the
ways
o Peace and Pleasantness; nay even to that Tree of Life, where
Substance
is to be Inherited: For that she opens the Door of Entrance to all
Mysteries
Divine and Natural; and consequently without her Men grope, as it were,
in the dark, even as a Blind Man does at Noon-day; for Nature&#8217;s
Hand-maid
was Created by him, and Job says, that God by his Spirit has garnished
the Heavens, His Hand has formed the crooked Serpent; and though there
is a Spirit in Man, yet it is the Inspiration of the Almighty that
gives
Understanding, whence we may readily Conceive, that Human Reason is too
short to Comprehend the Dignity of any true Mystery without the Aid of
God&#8217;s Spirit. </p>
  <p>This great Defect is too evidently apparent from the deplorable
Case
of the Chymical Searchers, concerning the Subject Matter of this
Discourse;
seeing they know not where to ground or fix their Intentions in the
choice
of a proper Subject, but frames each to himself a different Basis, and
so make an Innumerable Number of Errors concerning the same: This
Imaginary
Matter, which Phantasy only has given Birth to, they defend with all
the
eagerness imaginable, concluding it to be the Genuine Offspring of
Truth;
when, alas! It is but a Bastard brat of their own wandering
Imaginations
and ungrounded Thoughts, as in the Conclusion proves too Evident: This
is an Absurdity so great, so common, that amongst the many Pretenders,
I have never met with more than three that have escaped it: How then
can
it possibly be expected, tat such should ever Arrive at the wished for
Haven of Rest, when Ignorant both of the way and means by which they
must
come thither; for the Door of Entrance must not only be known, but also
the Key which opens the same, without which they may never expect
Admittance
into nature&#8217;s Treasury: Therefore consequently must still remain in the
horrible Mist of Errors; the most principal that have come Athwart me I
shall here lay down and reckon for Convincing of the Giddy-headed and
Rash
Searcher, but more Principally for the Edifying and Building up of a
Son
of Art. </p>
  <p>I shall begin first with an Error, which is almost Universally
received,
viz., that Mercury Vulgar is the Foundation or Basis of this Liquor;
this
is an Error that the Authors of some Expositors are guilty of, which
the
Ignorant Searcher has not been aware of, but hath gone to work as
confidently
on Mercury for the obtaining of the Philosophers, by several and
various
Preparations, as endeavoring to break its Body by Spittle, May Dew,
Vinegar,
and such like soppish Proceedings; also by Sublimation with Salts, and
Distillation, and other such like Operation, endeavoring to make it run
per deliq. to obtain an Airy and Universal Nature and radical
dissolution,
even that they call the Magnetic Salt, or Foliated Earth, and Mercurial
Chalybs; but all in vain; for that Mercury so prepared is still all one
with common Mercury: And so likewise is that, prepared by Regulus of
Antimony,
Silver, etc., for Vulgar Mercury is unripe Fruit fallen too soon from
the
Tree, therefore it must return to its First Fountain or Catholic
Liquor;
for the Philosophers introduce Fire, not Water, into Mercury, to make
her
Medicinal, both in the Particular, and also in the General; by which it
is brought to be forever irreducible to mercury. </p>
  <p>Another Error is in those, who seek for this Dissolvent in Dew and
Rain
Water, not considering, that this was designed only as Nourishment for
the Vegetable, having but such a Portion of the Universal Fire in it,
as
might serve to dissolve the Salt Nitre of the Earth, and then the
Vegetable
Seed in order to a new Production; this Fire or dissolver being far
remiss
to that of Animals, as that of Animals is to Minerals, cannot be the
Philosophers
Subject of this Dissolvent, for Life would be too short to extract it. </p>
  <p>Another Error is that many allow the Matter to be Universal, but
is
drawn by certain Magical magnets at select times in the Year; but this
is a grand Error, for the Matter is to be found Plentifully at all
Seasons
of the Year, especially in such places, as are mostly enriched by
Mineral
Fumes, and the manner of its Attraction is rather for the Necessity of
Human Life, than any Point in Art; so that the Artist must not be too
curious
in endeavoring to perform that which Nature hath already done to his
Hand. </p>
  <p>Another Error is in those that seek for this Dissolvent by
attracting
the Air with Alkanizated Salts, as Tartar, and not considering, that
all
Alkalized Salts do only attract a Saline Aquosity, which by often
Cohobations
may be turned wholly into an Elementary Water, whereas the true
Philosopher
(as already said) does by his magnets attract a Fire, may a Fiery
Spirit
stronger than any Fire in the World: It is true Alkalizated Salts are
noble
Subjects, and deservedly claim Preeminence, being Contradistinct to all
Acids, and therefore make a Dissolvent next to the great Liquor; but
these
can never be Volatilized without the Universal Medium, or Philosophers&#8217;
Diploma, together with Essential Oils and Vinous Spirits, and being so
Volatilized, they become noble Spirits, yet do notwithstanding spend
their
Virtue in Dissolving Bodies, and Coagulate upon them into a Salt,
retaining
their Volatility; so that consequently those are excluded from being
the
Subject of this Immortal Dissolvent. </p>
  <p>Another Error is in seeking for the Matter of this Liquor in he
Animal
Kingdom, viz. in Man; and indeed a greater in those, who assume to
teach
others, by their Assertion, that it is there; but having already
detected
such Writers (in the Preface) and also clearly shewn, that from Man,
the
Subject Matter of this Liquor can never be attained, although I know
that
this my Assertion does much thwart the general received Opinion, that
Urine
is the Basis, and that Van Helmont, Philalethes, Starkey, etc., have in
their Writings asserted the same, so that I do Contradict the Testimony
of these Worthies: Instance Helmont, where he speaks of the dissolution
of the Stone Ludus, seems to assert that it is performed by a Second
drawn
from Urine: And Philalethes, in his Treatise extant, has grounded the
Basis
of the Immortal Dissolvent on Urine and Blood; and George Starkey in
his
Treatise of this Liquor seems to ground the subject thereof on Urine;
nay,
an Intimate Acquaintance of his did affirm the very Process to me,
which
he made use of, viz., the Urine of sound Men, unfermented, which, as
soon
as it was made, was by Evaporation brought t a Consistence, in order to
unite the two Salts, Volatile and Fixed, and so by Distillation and
Cohobation
till the whole was brought over, and then being digested and dephlegmed
the Alkahest is prepared. Dr. Bacon was, as I have been told, much of
this
Opinion; but all these are short of Understanding the Truth of the
Subject,
or of the Authors before mentioned; for it is easy to be collected from
Helmont, Philalethes, etc., that they never depended upon Human Urine
as
the Subject of this Immortal Dissolvent for then they would not have
directed
you to the Chaos of the Ancients; as the true Subject, describing it
Figuratively,
and analogizing it with Man; because Man subsists by and from the
Universal
Spirit, which is the true Subject of this Dissolvent which they for
some
secret Reasons would not be so Candid to deliver: the like has Alipili
in his Book entitled Centrum Naturae Concentratum, which very Title
shows,
that it is not Man there meant, but the Universal Spirit that being the
very Life and Center of all Centers: Therefore who ever shall assert,
that
Man is the Basis from whence this Liquor is obtained, let him be
respected
of Envy or Ignorance; because there is no Subject to be drawn from Man,
that will act on Minerals 500 or a thousand Times, and retain the same
Virtue, quantity and quality, as if it had not acted at all: Therefore
I regard not such Fops or such others, that dote upon highly rectified
Spirit of Urine, mixed with the true Spirit of Wine, until both
Coagulate
into a Salt, which is Distilled and Sublimed by the Addition of fresh
Spirit
of Wine, until they come over in Form of a Fiery Liquor: There are
others
also that dote on the strong Spirit of Urine united with the Spirit of
Vinegar, and Distilled into a Neutral Spirit: but Experience the
Mistress
of all true Art shows that these are all greatly mistaken, and many
others,
too long here to Enumerate: Therefore shall pass them by, and only
insist
on some few others that remain. </p>
  <p>Those are also mistaken, that depend on Acid Spirits, as the
Subject
of the Liquor, as Nitre, Vitriol, common Salt, Salt Gen, or the Mother
Liquors of any of these, or any other Salts growing in or extracted
from
the Earth; for all of them, none excepted, will by Distillation yield
an
Acid Spirit, and our Liquor being no Acid, but Contradistinct
thereunto,
these of Course are all to be rejected, and ought so to be in the Use
of
the Liquor when prepared: others, that think themselves more prudent
dote
much on the Spirit of Verdigris, and more especially if it is First
often
dissolved in Spirit of Vinegar, and made transparently Pure, and then
shot
in Spirit of Wine and so Distilled, they then put as great a Price or
Value
on it, as in Reason can be set upon the Immortal Dissolvent itself; but
this Menstruum being Published by Zwelfer, and long before by Basil
Valentine,
whom I take to be the right and true Author of it, and being easy to be
prepared, it follows that the Liquor Alkahest would be no uncommon or
unknown
Secret; but that remaining still as the greatest of Secrets, plainly
demonstrates,
that these are not the Subject, whence that is obtained. </p>
  <p>They are also misled, who depend on Mineral Sulphurs, or the
Vitriols
of Metals or that of Venus, described by Polemanus; because there&#8217;s
none
of these. But what are sluggish in themselves, and unactive Beings, and
can&#8217;t be radically opened and separated from their Mercury&#8217;s, without
the
Liquor&#8217;s help, and then they become Passive Medicines not an Active
Menstruum,
so of Course are to be excluded from being the Subject Matter of this
Dissolvent. </p>
  <p>Another great Mistake and grand Error is in those, that depend
upon
the Essential Oils, as Wormwood, Mint, Thyme; or the Oils of Gums, as
Amber,
Benjamin, Turpentine, and these being Chaosed down and devoured by
Corrosives,
as Oil of Vitriol, Aquafortis, and being again revived, then becoming
(as
they say) the Regenerated Spirit of Wine of the Philosophers; which
being
Distilled from Tartar, Sal Armoniac and Mercury, each distinctly, till
their Bodies are brought over, they are then the Magi&#8217;s three
distinctly,
till their Bodies are brought over, they are then the magi&#8217;s three
Universal
Menstruums, viz., Minimum, Minus, and Majus: But this mistake has
proved
too evidently false, to the great Expense and Disappointment of many
worthy
Persons in this Kingdom, and indeed no better can be expected from such
Heterogeneous and unnatural Mixtures, as being farther Alienated from
the
Universal Spirit, than some others already Named, and consequently the
more remote from being the Subject of this Liquor. </p>
  <p>To be short, I do on an Experimental Ground exclude Animals,
Vegetables
and Minerals in all and every particular Class and part thereof from
being
the Subject of this Liquor; therefore shall omit any farther Discourse
of this kind and come nearer to the Matter in hand, which is to detect
the Errors of those, who confound this Liquor with the Mercury of the
Philosophers,
saying they are the same in the Subject Matter, Identity and Operation;
it is true, the Mercury of the Philosophers is a natural Dissolvent,
but
it dissolves in the way of Generation, when as this Circulated Salt or
Alkahest dissolves it by way of separation and destruction; so that
they
differ in Operation, as much as Love and Wrath; the one in Love
preserved,
the other in Wrath destroys the Life and Motion. </p>
  <p>There are also other Ignorant Boasters, who confound them
together,
yet know neither the one nor the other, yet say, they are both the same
in Composition and Digestion, but near the Birth of the Royal babe, the
Matter divides itself into two distinct Parts, the one a Body
Permanent,
the other a Menstruous Liquor or Blood, which being Distilled is the
Alkahest,
this shows their great Ignorance, for the same that is a Body is a
Spirit,
and the Blood is Homogeneous with both the Mercury of the Philosophers
and Liquor Alkahest; for the mercury can never be prepared without its
Aid, as being one of the three Springs; neither can the Spirit of the
Body
subsist without the Blood, as every true Philosopher does, with me,
know,
and that at this State there is no division to be admitted, without a
Death
to the whole Compound; for the whole Matter in the Production of each
being
diversely wrought on produces the different Effect; the one is a
Mercury
Homogeneous, the other a Ponderous Saline Liquor and in the Production
of both there are superfluous Oils separated, which though Medicinal,
are
not in the least Homogeneous to either; which clearly Evinces their
Ignorance
in the Process of Nature, which is to make Bodies Spirits, and Spirits
Bodies again, and that this Menstruous Liquor or Blood is the Life
which
is sown in his own Womb of Mercury for the Exaltation of both; for
there
the Heterogeneous Feces are cast off, and so it is qualified and united
with the Spirit in order to Redeem the Body; and so is a principal
Ingredient
of the Stone, when as the Alkahest is not: It would be too long to
enumerate
the vain and false Conceptions of Men concerning this Immortal Liquor,
and seeing these distinctions do better become that Chapter, where the
difference shows between the Liquor Alkahest and Mercury of
Philosophers,
I shall omit speaking of it any farther in this, and come to show the
Subject
of the Dissolvent in the next Chapter, and so Conclude this. </p>

&nbsp;
  <p>In the former Chapter, I have laid down the Mistakes concerning
the
Matter of this Immortal Dissolvent, which Helmont describes in the Word
Latex, which properly imports a hidden Source or Fountain, so hidden
indeed,
that he himself says, when this was found Religion stood amazed, that
he
himself says, when this was found Religion stood amazed, and well may
the
Religious Man be so indeed, when their Descriptions are so Occult; for
from the Word Latex, which in Vulgar Reception signified Liquors, which
may be properly conceived to be Aqueous and Spiritual, he presently
comes
to tell you, that the Masterpiece at which Art is leveled, is to find
out
a Body; which may play with us in such a Symphony or consenting
Harmony,
by Reason of its exquisite Purity, that no Corruptive Principle can
find
in it any Heterogeneities by which to work in it a Dissipation of
Parts;
here he immediately calls it a Body; hence we must for certain conclude
that this Source or Fountain, though liquid, does contain a Body in it,
or else it would have been vain in him to have directed us to such a
Body
in it, or else it would have been vain in him to have directed us to
such
a Body for the Object, and that so circumspectly and diligently, as to
find it by hard Labor and Industry, saying you must be careful, or
sedulously
Industrious about finding out such a Body, which by Examen and Proof is
very difficult to be found, because the Words import, that there is no
such Body in all Natural Beings, that does Answer what this great
Philosopher
describes of his, therefore we must conclude, that these Words also
import
Aid; for that Industry is also recommended, which is as much as if he
had
said you must seek for the hidden source or Fountain of Nature, and
Universal
Spirit, which Art must form into a Body; but this Son of Wisdom
doubtless
was afraid to speak after this plain blunt manner, as a Tyro does, for
fear of exposing the Secret too plain; but it is clear, that this was
the
meaning, because nothing is so hidden in Nature as the Source of this
Universal
Fountain, and nothing in Nature has Power to reduce Bodies by Symphony
or consenting Harmony but what does arise here from; for in these
latter
words he also described the nature and Quality of the Matter to have
two
Faces; for that without there had been a composition, the word Harmony
needed not to have been used; so that in these Words abundance of
Matter
is couched in little room, every word being a full Sentence; how
lightly
or slightly soever the Reader may pass them over: It is true Starkey
does
very learnedly strike the Mark in his Exposition upon them, yet his
Comment
is so wisely Regulated as to be kept as obscure, as the Text itself; by
this means and method I find, that the Basis of this Liquor was by this
Philosopher designed to remain a Secret to the end of time: Therefore
for
the Benefit of the true desires of Art, I shall deliver the Subject
Matter
of this Immortal Liquor with much clearness and candidness, yet hope
that
my Style and Words will be such, as to clothe it by such a Medium, as
that
it may give Light to the chosen Sons of Wisdom, yet at the same time
cast
a Mist before the Eyes of the Unworthy: This Method being agreeable to
divine Wisdom itself; for we find, that what was a Light to the Hosts
to
the Children of Israel, was a Cloud of Darkness of that of the
Egyptians. </p>
  <p>These Things being stated, I shall now come to the Consideration
and
Illustration of that Subject Matter they point forth, viz., the hidden
Fountain must be of a double Nature, or what if I should say it must be
a Body of Salt appearing under two Faces, which being united makes
Symphony
or Consenting Harmony; the Reason of which is shews; for then it is a
Liquor
of that excellent Purity, as to admit of no division of Parts;
therefore
as I said before, Labor couched in Helmont&#8217;s Words: The Business of
Nature
in affording such an universal Fountain to the Artist, that is the
Basis
of the said Immortal Liquor; and the Business of Art is to know how to
make it Corporeal, and when so Corporified to contain two Faces, which
Faces Philalethes figures forth by Urine and Blood; the first Face is a
Body, yet nevertheless may be distilled into a Spirit, nay so
Homogenous
as not to leave one Grain or fixedness or Salt behind it, which he
describes
to Distill over in Veins like Spirit of Wine, and speaking very great
of
its Active Qualities in dissolving Bodies; the Query is put, whether it
is not the Alkahest, the Answer is in the negative, saying, it could
not
Subsist without Blood, and then presently comes to the Affirmative
concerning
the Subject-Matters of the Alkahest, and says, it is contained in Blood
and Urine; these things may grabble and amuse the Thoughts of the
Unwary
concerning the Reality and Possibility of these Assertion, yet
nevertheless
they are as clear and perspicacious to the Eye of the Wise, as the Sun
in his Luster upon the Meridian; for the Universal Spirit being
Concreted
becomes a Mist, Vapor or Chaos, or rather an Unctuous and Viscous
Water,
which is the true Matter of all the Ancient Philosophers, concerning
which
Chaos I have written largely in Mercury&#8217;s Caduceus, and have there
shown,
tat in its Womb is contained the first Essence of all Forms, yet
unspecificated,
and so consequently it contains these two of Urine and Blood which
indeed
are the Urine and Blood of the great World, and not of Man; but more
noble;
which my Eyes have seen and my hands have handled made Corporeal;
therefore
I would not have you spend your time in vain, gazing on Husks or the
outside
Shell of things but Press for the Kernel, or that excellent Sweetness
which
is placed on the Center of Beings, which can&#8217;t be extracted but by
profound
Meditation, and hard Labors, which must be thy Interpreters; for it is
not requisite that Matters should be discovered more plainly, it is but
just and fitting that God should be the sole Dispenser of it, till the
fullness of time, when according to the Promise, hidden things shall be
made manifest even such as have lain hidden from the Foundation of the
World: Therefore, O Son of Art! Thou must pray to God, but use the
means,
and put thy Hand top the Plow, not looking back; then these
Instructions
will be as Fundamental Rules to begin thy Labors by which to obtain
this
Noble Secret, which is not so much a Product of Nature but of Art: For
I have in these Sheets endeavored to clear up the Matter, so as to
qualify
thee with Theory, thence to Judge of Sophistical Authors, and the
better
to enable thee to withdraw thy Mind from their Entanglement, that thou
might build upon that sure Rock, which will remain in the Storm of
Trials;
this I have done in Bowels of Love as well knowing the great Grief and
Torture of Mind undergone in my unwearied Search after this Secret,
even
when the true Subject Matter was known; which said Matter is also the
Matter
of the Grand Secret of the Ancients; but diversified into different
Natures
by the different Operations, and so far distinct the one from the
other,
and therefore he that is a Complete Master of both, is properly styled
Adeptus Duplicatus. </p>
  <p>To the Truth of this my Affirmation, I have not only Experience,
but
also the Concurring Testimony of that renowned Philosopher Ludovicus de
Comitibus who says that the Matter of the Liquor Alkahest and
Philosophers&#8217;
mercury do both proceed from the same Chaos, but by different
Operations
are brought to different Effects; therefore before thou proceed to the
Preparation of this Liquor, thou must learn to understand this general
matter, Mass or rude Chaos, which is the Source or Fountain of so many
Mysteries; for this Liquor does not only proceed from it, but also it
is
the Wellspring of the Mineral Life, and while this World hath a being,
will be an inexhaustible Fountain to all those Mysteries, so hiddenly
delivered
by the Ancients; for once again I say, that not only the Stone, the
great
Elixir, but also this hidden Fire does proceed therefrom: But here you
must Understand the first Chaos, before the Philosophical Mercury is
produced
therefrom. </p>
  <p>Therefore a Body and not Bodies must be sought for, which being
found
is the Center of the Universal Influences Concentrated and the Blood of
the said Body to be One in Essence with the Body, though it appears to
Sight in a twofold diversity, yet distinct in Quality or Completion,
but
agrees so Fundamentally, which being United by the hand of an Artist
will
make the Symphony or Consenting Harmony before spoken of; for in this
Case
it may be said of it, as in another place is spoken o the Mercury of
Philosophers,
that which is above is as that which is beneath, and so Vice Versa; for
that the Essence and Life of the Blood can&#8217;t be obtained without the
Fermentative
Spirit of the Earth, or Saturn&#8217;s Urine; neither can this Spirit of the
Earth be Homogeneous and Immortal, without it extracts the Life of the
Blood: George Starkey a Disciple of Nature does in his Treatise of the
said Liquor in a Parabolical way deliver himself concerning these two
Faces,
thus, that most acute, subtle and penetrating Spirit of Man&#8217;s Urine by
the help of another Medium, not of divers Ferment to itself, but
centrally
One with it, must be united with an Acid, not Corrosive, sed Naturae
sua
Gratissimum this Acid must be equally Volatile with the Salt of Urine
before
it can be Married or United intimately with it; then by often
Circulations
it attains that height of Purity to be entitled Ens Saliu Summum Salium
et Felicissum. Now that which is centrally one with this Philosophical
Urine is Blood; for the Blood is the Universal Form, as the Body is the
Universal matter, but these being United by Force is called a Violent
Way;
for it is a different thing to sow Gold in his own Matrix of Universal
mercury, and so ferment it and bring it into Spirit; for then it
becomes
unfit for the work of Multiplication, the Seminal Virtue being then
totally
destroyed and annihilated, which is the very Matter and case of the
Difference
of the Mercury of Philosophers and Alkahest. </p>
  <p>I have shown you not only the Matter, but also the Manner and
apparition
of the Matter in the Hand of the Artist; I shall now come to show you
the
Nature and internal Property of the same, when the Knowledge thereof is
obtained: I say it is wholly of a Saline Nature, which is a middle
Property
held up in the Arms of Nature, and is contradistinct to either Acid or
Alkali so that neither of those, as already shown in the former, have
any
right to be the Matter or Foundation of this Dissolvent, but this
Saline
Quality is the Central One, so that consequently this pure Spirit hath
some Garment or a Shell, by which it is covered and in which it is
hatched
and brought to Maturation; and to speak plainly, candidly and honestly
it is a Combust Sulphur, so wholly combust that the Spirit being drawn
from the Earth the Feces will burn without the least Smoke, which shows
that there is neither any Mercurial or Saline part remaining; this is a
Reduction of the Pure from the Impure, or a Clean from an Unclean, by
the
Serpents devouring himself, and then renovating into that, over which
Death
has no Power: Observe, he first begins by biting his own Tail, and so
by
Degrees devours himself, and last of all his Head, which shows that the
Earth or Tail is first to be Dissolved, which then Dissolves the Head
or
Blood; and that these are the two Principles spoken of by Philalethes
is
very plain; for in his Secrets Revealed, he calls it the first Ens of
Salts,
saying the true Philosophers rejected all Salts, one Salt only
excepted,
which dissolves all Metals, and by the same Work coagulates Mercury;
but
this is not done but by a Violent way and therefore that kid of Agent
is
again separated both entirely in its weight and Virtue from the thing
it
is put to: And in his Exposition upon Ripley&#8217;s Epistle, speaking of the
Separation of the Sulphur from the Mercury of Bodies, he says, it is
performed
by the help of a Liquor drawn from the first Ens of Salt; and Helmont
and
Starkey say as much calling it Ens Salium, Summum Salium Felicissum
which
is the very same, that I do here assert it of it: What shall I say,
must
I in every word transgress the Silence of Pythagoras; No, be thankful
for
this, for it had never come to thy Hand, had I not made a Solemn
Resolution
in the time of my hard Labors, Sweats and Agony of Body and Spirit,
that
if ever the Almighty Being should bless me with the Knowledge of this
Liquor,
I would then deliver it so Candid, as that my writings should be a sure
Landmark to the undaunted Coaster in his intended Voyage to the Haven
of
Rest; which Promise I have here fully accomplished in showing the
Universal
Source or Fountain, from whence this Liquor and the great Elixir do
arise,
is one, so that more needs not to be said as to this Point, therefore
shall
conclude this Chapter. </p>

  <b><font size="+1">The True Way and Manner of Preparing the Liquor
Alkahest</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <a name="3"></a> <br>
&nbsp;
  <p>The Mistakes and also the true Matter being shown, I shall now
come
to show the true manner of the Preparation of this great Dissolvent
which
is very difficult; for as Philalethes in his Exposition on Ripley&#8217;s
Gates,
says the Liquor Alkahest is 100 times more difficult to Prepare than
the
great Elixir; and that upon good Ground has this worthy Author thus
delivered
it; for the Elixir is a work of Nature, and the Mercurial Power doth
Purge
off the Dregs naturally, and it is called Elixir, so long as it is
Water,
for as Count Trevisan says, Azoth is drawn out of the Elixir, as Oil
out
of Water; therefore as the Elixir is natural, the Liquor Alkahest is
artificial,
and as Ludovicus de Comitibus says, very difficult to be searched into;
for it may be variously thought of, being artificial; for the Subject
as
it tends to Generation and Corruption in order to a more excellent
Birth,
is then vile and mutable, Proteus like puts on all Shapes; and what we
search for must be pure and clear, and above all things immutable; so
that
here is Chymical Faith required to believe beforehand and after sight
will
astonish Reason to contemplate it, crying out with Holy Admiration, O
Lord!
How wonderful art thou in all thy Works. </p>
  <p>Ready! If you would consider the work of Creation it was the very
same;
for out of the rude Mass or Chaos was not only produced the most
despicable
Object we behold, but also the most Glorious Creature that ever was
Created,
not only Paradise, but also the transcendant Glorious Angels, so that
from
this the difficulties do arise, how to proceed by Art in separation of
this Chaos, as also the due way and manner of joining due Agents and
patients
by the separating of things adjoined, for it is not sufficient to
understand
the Aqua Vitae of the Wise, but you must also know, how to preserve it
from its Compeer or Water, but you must also know, now to preserve it
from
its Compeer or Water; for being separated from the strict Tie it had in
the Elements, it would rather pass over than come again to Coagulation:
Again, it is easy to be destroyed, if you take it unripe, by the
violent
Fire of Separation: </p>
  <p>These Difficulties did so amuse and puzzle me as to keep me back
from
the Possession of the said Liquor many Years, which Knowledge I then
vained
abundantly more than the Possession of great Treasures; but however
blessed
be God I have great Reason to say, that one Secret seldom discovers
itself
alone, for the Knowledge of one is a large step of Entrance into the
other;
for that in this Subject both of them lie, invisibly hidden, as it
were,
under the strong folds of a Mineral Ens, which the Industrious hand
must
labor to make Manifest; which being effected, his time will be little
enough,
to contemplate and admire at the sight of the Operation its wonderful
Effects. </p>
  <p>Observe, in the Manifestation it is reduced to the smallest Atoms
imaginable,
through which it arises to the Eminent Dignity spoken of; for as
Helmont
and Starkey have it, Ad minimos reductus Atomos in Natura possibiles,
etc.,
dignius de Corpus non reperiens cui Nuberet; This Latex, which is vile
and contemptible, is advanced to the transcendent height of Purity and
Perfection, which Words, says the latter, are soon said, but not so
soon
understood, and hardest of all to be done; which is the Reason of the
many
difficulties mentioned in this Chapter, concerning its Preparation. </p>
  <p>&#8216;Tis true, this Operation is in few Words taught by Paracelsus,
where
he says in his Treatise, De viribus Membrorum Cap. de Hepate, the
Process
of the Alkahest is (Ut a Coagulatione sua resolvatur, ac deinde
Coaguletur
in Formam transmutatum, sicut Processus Coagulandi et Resolvendi
docet),
which Process is the greatest Light that acute Philosophers gives
concerning
this Mystery; no marvel then if the Doctrine of its Preparation remains
so obscure in the World; for Starkey allows, that Helmont&#8217;s Doctrine is
equally as obscure, as that of Paracelsus, and I say that Starkey&#8217;s is
as obscure as either of them, and indeed that of Ludovicus de Comitibus
not much clearer; for that Solution and Intervening Coagulation is the
greatest Light, that any of the Philosophers have given concerning the
Preparation of this Liquor; for there is this Reason of such an
Obscuration,
the Process by the given is General, and common and alike to most or
all
Chymical Mysteries, but more especially to the two Grand Arcana&#8217;s, viz.
the Liquor Alkahest and the Philosophers&#8217; Elixir. </p>
  <p>But the manner of Solution and Coagulation is quite different, the
one
is Natural, as already said, the other Artificial, and therefore very
difficult,
because it is not easily searched out, and that it may be variously
conceived
of; but that which has been hitherto known and demonstrated by all true
Artists is Solution and Coagulation; we shall a little consider the
difference
and manner of this Solution in both these Magisteries. </p>
  <p>The Dissolution requisite in order to obtain the Alkahest is a
dissolving
of the Body into a Spirit that will never Coagulate into a Body again,
but the Dissolution in order to obtain the Mercury of the Philosophers
is a Dissolution, wherein the Essence of the Body is so Congealed, as
to
become a Ferment to the mercury, to Congeal the Body again; for as the
Worthy Trevisan says concerning the Preparation of the Mercury of the
Philosophers,
the same matter must abide that the same Form may follow, and that
nothing
is to be added to it, nor taken from it, but a Superfluous Phlegm and
red
Earth; for when Bodies are to be Renovated it must be done by things in
kind; therefore Trevisan makes it a great Error to alter Mercury from
its
Metallic Species; we may ground, that the Great Work is performed by
the
dissolution of the Body and Congelation of the Spirit, but the work of
the Circulated Salt is a Solution into Secondary Principles, but not
into
Elements; for nothing of Profit can be expected from thence, yet this
Solution
ought not to be into every distinct Principle, but into one Saline
Liquor,
Homogenous and Immortal. Here this Body of two faces, or that of old
Saturn&#8217;s
Urine and the Blood o the Great World are reduced to one, ad that you
may
know it when so reduced, it is a Fire, yet in the form of Water; &#8216;tis
an
Air, yet Condensed; &#8216;tis no Corrosive, yet the most sharp and perpetual
Corrosive; &#8216;tis not Medicinal yet the Crown of all true Medicine, being
a Cleanser and Purifier in nature, a Destroyer and Conqueror of Bodies;
&#8216;tis called the Fire of Hell, because the Spirit that comes from the
Center
is united to the Blood without the Intermediation of the Heavenly Rays
of Mercury, yet acts with that Purity, as that it finds no Body more
noble
than itself to join withal, therefore is not Commiscible with any
Ferment,
and so not capable of Transmutation. </p>
  <p>These things being considered I shall now come to give you a short
scheme
of what Helmont says concerning this Liquor, the first is what the
Artist
desires, and is Comprehended in these words, Art is solicitous in
finding
out a Body, which may play with us in such a Symphony or consenting
Harmony
by reason of its exquisite Purity, that no Corruptive Principle can
find
in it any Heterogenities, by which to work in it a Dissipation of
Parts:
This is the Sum of what the Artist would attain, and is the Chief of
all
which can be by Art sought for. The Second is, what Art by Industry
doth
find, Comprehended in these Words, Religion then stood amazed, the
Latex
being found, which reduced to the smallest Atoms possible in Nature
despises
the Wedlock of every Ferment, in vain therefore is its Transmutation
sought
for, not finding a Body more worthy than itself whereunto it may be
joined.
The Third discovers the Anomaly of this Production, in these Words; But
the Art of Labor of Philosophy hath brought forth an Anomalous Product
in Nature, which took its being without Mixture of any Ferment, divers
or Heterogeneous to itself and the Fourth contains a short Adumbration
of the Process, the Serpent bit himself, revived from the Poison into a
pure Essence, over which Death hath no Power. All which to a Son of
Wisdom
I have with much Candidness already explained; but for the benefit of
Tyros
I shall now come to give a farther Illustration by way of Mechanic
Demonstration. </p>
  <p>If Art will from the latex obtain a Body, it must be begun with
Coagulation,
and with such magnetical Earth, as Attracts the Celestial Rays and
Universal
Spirit, and Concentrates them in the Center, for that in the Center the
pure Parts of the Starry Fire is digested, and in the Center all the
Influences
meet, and from the Center dos the living Ferch proceed; for &#8216;tis the
Central
Archaeus that Sublimes the Mineral Vapor or those pure Spirits that are
of a dissolving Nature; this is the Body which Art is Industrious about
and desirous to know, even the Body of the Universal Salt and Sulphur
of
the great World; for in the Mechanical Demonstration from thence
proceeds
such a Spirit which in all Nature has not its Compeer; but before &#8216;tis
brought to that Harmony, as to admit of no Dissipation of parts, it
must
have time to maturate, and to form to itself some pure Garments or a
Complete
Coagulation, which is done by Successive Animations, so as to bring the
Spirit of the Earth to permanency before it is taken out of its Nest,
and
that is done by successive Retrogradations, or repeated Coagulations to
being this Transverse Work of the Earth the nearer to its purity, for
then
only it is, that it admits no dissipation of Parts. </p>
  <p>The Body being found and thus purified, and its Spirit produced
from
the small Invisible Putrified Atoms of the same doth cause a Religious
Astonishment; that from so dry a Body as the Earth should proceed the
Central
Latex or the most hidden Rivulet of the great Ocean itself, nothing in
the World being so pure it despises to Contract Wedlock with every
specificated
Form whatsoever, and so its Transmutation is impossible, and indeed the
oftener this Universal Spirit passes through the entrails of the
Elements,
the greater is its Purity and the fitter for Action; for on the other
hand
matter could not Subsist, but by the continual additional Rays of its
Universality;
therefore, Reader, retain thy Amusement for a time, and thou shalt hear
the Philosophical Trumpet calling thee to behold a wonderful rarity,
even
the Indian Brahman&#8217;s Famous Water Works, Contradistinct to all others,
as it is a well compacted Body of Fire burning in Water, and in full
Luster
and not extinguished; for in the Decoction the Blood and Urine is
Centrally
One, but in the Coagulation they appear under two Faces; Philalethes
says
as much, speaking of the next Matter of the Alkahest, says &#8216;tis a Salt
and the Fire surrounds the Salt, and the Water swallows up the Fire,
and
yet overcomes it not, and so is made the Philosophers&#8217; Fire, of which
they
speak, the Vulgar burn with Fire, ad we with Water: it being so
transcendentally
pure then scorns to be joined with any Compeer, and so admits of no
Wedlock. </p>
  <p>Herein consists the Excellency of this Liquor that Art and Labor
conspire
together to produce this Ens or being without any mixture of any
ferment
Diverse or Heterogeneous to itself; for indeed its Composition is
wholly
from Universal Principles, or Virgin Elements, and Invisible ones too,
for the earth and the Water of this Fountain is as Invisible to the Eye
of the Vulgar as the Fire and Air, but being made Manifest to the
Artist
do Conspire together to bring forth one Anomalous Birth; therefore be
assured,
from these Words this Great Philosopher would point forth, that this
Liquor
is not Compounded of two things of different Natures, for then it would
be Subject to Death, but of one thing alone even the most Universal
Salt
of Nature, which is divided into two, and returns to one again, so
consequently
is one in Nature and Essence. </p>
  <p>But now the Adumbration of the Process doth also shew the
Universality
and Uncomprehendingness of this Ens, it is represented by a Serpent
biting
himself and reviving from the Poison into a pure Essence, over which
Death
has no Power; observe the Ancient Egyptians always by a Serpent
understood
this Universal Spirit; because of the Subtlety of its Parts, and that
Creature
of all others is the most Subtle, and therefore well may it figure
forth
by the holding its Tail in its Mouth Nature&#8217;s Circulation from one
Universal
Element to another, till all the Elementary Qualities are unbanded, and
the pure Essence of all extracted, which moves upon an Immortal Hinge
and
therefore will admit of no Dissipation of Parts or Evaporation of
Moisture;
for as it is Homogene, &#8216;tis of an equal Volatility, and being the
Celestial
Fire made Terrestrial by its own Power can&#8217;t be destroyed by any
specificated
Body whatever, therefore well might Helmont say, as there is but one
Fire
in the World, so there is but one Liquor, none other partaking in
Quality
with it, as the Adepti do know and can testify: Which Liquor is that
which
will, Samson like, make sport for the Artist, and do ore than ever the
Lords of the Philistines could have expected from him, plucking down
and
destroying as he did not Houses, but the most Compact and Solid Bodies
of Minerals, and like a Valiant Conqueror maintains his Ground against
all opposing Enemies: but few are the Kings, Lords or Nobles, that have
been so happy to see the battle fought by this Anomalous Combatant, not
only for the Reasons afore rendered, but also for the tediousness of
the
Preparation, which we shall now come to speak of and so Conclude this
Chapter. </p>
  <p>As to the time of preparing this Liquor &#8216;tis long and tedious,
which
Helmont also Complains of, but Starkey explains this to be more upon
the
Account of the Stink in the first Preparation, than of the tediousness
or length of time; for he limits it to a few certain Days, which I know
is impossible to be Effected, unless he begins to Calculate from the
time
that the Body is ripe and fit to be broke by Violence, and to be
distilled
over into a Spirit, then to Unite the Blood or other Face may be
accomplished
in his time: But for my part I do comprehend from Helmont what
Experience
shows, viz., that the time is long and tedious, and attended with many
difficulties, which Helmont also knew, or else he would not have
Complained
so much for the loss of his Bottle; Crying out, O that I had removed my
Receiver; from whence we may readily Conceive, that he suffered Loss:
Ludovicus
de Comitibus puts the question beyond doubt concerning the tediousness
of the time where speaks of the Reduction and Retrogradation saying, it
can&#8217;t be performed by common Labor; but requires both Art and Time,
which,
he says, is long and therefore whoever thinks to obtain it by Violence
and in a short time shall find himself much deceived, for he can never
bring it to any final Complement, and consequently will never be able
to
know what virtue &#8216;tis Impowered withal, even that Fiery and Vital one;
for that it is destroyed by force by his Compeer, which Helmont and
Starkey
do allow, but tell not what the Compeer is; but that excellent Son of
Art
Ludovicus aforesaid, says &#8216;tis Water, therefore I&#8217;ll attribute to him
the
Praise, his Writings giving me the first Light of discovery, what this
Compeer was. </p>
  <p>O Reader, thou must of necessity allow that it is a time of
Tediousness
as well as difficulty to Concentrate the benignant Spirit of the World,
to make such a strong Sulphureous and Saline Liquor of it, as will
dissolve
the hardest Metals, even those, that oppose Common Fire, are by this
Liquor
radically opened, it being as we may call it, the very Essence of the
Elements
Heavenly and Earthly; and what Typifies the Fire of the last Judgment,
which is permanent over the elements in a Quintessential Nature, so
that
the Degrees of its purity are not to be wondered at; the Artist hath
great
Cause to Bless and Praise the Lord his God, who hath made him an
Instrument
to produce a clean thing out of an unclean, which that God man Job so
much
Questioned saying, who can bring a Clean thing out of an Unclean,
surely
none but God alone; so that we see the best of Men speak but according
to that knowledge, which the Almighty thinks fit to reveal unto them;
for
he disposes of Knowledge as of Rivers, communicating it for the use of
all: Therefore Paul&#8217;s Advice was Sound and Candid, Judge not Ignorantly
of things thou understands not: For indeed if we look upon the thing
aright
&#8216;tis properly the Work of God; for as Trevisan says concerning the
Exaltation
of the Work in the Great Elixir, &#8216;tis done Christi Cratia, Importing
that
Man can&#8217;t alter the ordained Course of Nature, but as an Instrument in
the Hand of God stands still to see a mighty deliverance; but we are
speaking
of that where Art must lend her help, because Nature is altered from
her
usual Course, and a Clean thing is also required; but this is a Talent
not Committed to every one&#8217;s Trust. </p>
  <p>Now this clean thing can never be Produced but by a Radical Union
of
the foresaid Principles, not only by a bare Association or Apposition
of
Parts, so that the same may be said of this, as is of that Union of
Sulphur
and mercury in the Great Work, viz. they can never more be separated,
neither
in Love nor Woe, this Radical Union is as Principally required in this
Liquor, as it is in Azoth, which is a Volatile Tender Spirit for
Whitening
Laton: Now this being separated from many Heterogeneities hath no
Eminent
smell, but is a Ponderous, subtle Liquor, which will not stand over but
in a considerable Degree of heat in Sand, viz. the Third Degree, and
admits
of its Phlegm to be distilled off first, as other Ponderous Spirits do:
Philalethes speaking of the Substance and Preparation of this Liquor
delivers
himself thus: &#8216;Tis a Noble Circulated Salt prepared with wonderful Art,
till it answers the desires of an Ingenious Artist; yet &#8216;tis not any
Corporeal
Salt made liquid by a bare Solution, but is a Saline Spirit, which Heat
cannot Coagulate by evaporation of the Moisture, but is of a Spiritual
Uniform Substance, Volatile; which in a gentle Heat will Distill over,
leaving nothing behind; that is to be understood in a Requisite Heat of
Sand; so is there an Exaltation made far above what Nature was able
ever
to perform. </p>
  <p>Thus I have delivered the difficulties and also touched at the
Fire
and given you the right way of its Preparation from Point to Point, I
have
declared the Truth without Defect or Ambiguity of Words; and have as
formerly
mentioned, shows thou that no strange ferments are used, the Principles
being Centrally contained in the Original Chaos, which being separated
and brought again to an Indissoluble Union, is, the Serpent devouring
his
own Tail and so renovating into that, upon which Death can have no
Power:
but this cannot be performed, but by the help of Fires of divers sorts,
Convenient Vessels, fit Furnaces and Glasses, and a considerable time
to
boot, without all which it will be impossible for the Artist to obtain
his desired end, being as I have delivered, much easier to know the
Matter,
than to find out the true manner of its Preparation, which is chiefly
and
principally to be sought for at the hand of the Almighty; these are
Secrets
which belong to the Divine Treasury, and therefore the Aid or free
leave
of the Triune Power must be implored, to open the Door of Entrance,
which
may otherwise forever remain shut to thee. </p>
  <p>Yet I have not been wanting in these Sheets to Communicate my
Experience,
and Candidly to show the Preparation of this Immortal Liquor, so far as
was lawful for me without exposing it to the hands of debauched Person
and Impostors, and he that can&#8217;t gather it from what is here delivered
will scarcely obtain it from the Voluminous Circumlocutions of other
Writers;
who have so Intermixed the Preparation and entangled it with the
Philosophical
Mercury, that the Artist stands in need of Ariadne&#8217;s Clue to lead him
out
of that Labyrinth; in which Maze that the Ingenious may be no longer
bewildered,
I shall in the following Chapter distinctly and clearly discover the
difference
between the Liquor Alkahest and Mercury of the Philosophers. </p>

  <b><font size="+1">The Difference Between This Liquor and the Mercury
of the Philosophers</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <a name="4"></a> <br>
&nbsp;
  <p>The Labor of the Candid and honest hearted is the until those
difficult
Knots, which the envious have always been endeavoring to tie, and to
bring
the Industrious out of the Labyrinth, where they have been entangled
and
bewildered, so as to loose the right Path, and for this end I an
willing
to lend my Hand to conduct the searcher through this Wood where many an
honest hearted and laborious Man I am well satisfied have lost their
Way,
as not being able to distinguish the different Path of the Liquor
Alkahest
and Mercury of the Philosophers, designing this Chapter as a Plain and
knowing Pilot in this Case. </p>
  <p>I hope that nothing but Ignorance itself will question the Verity
of
what I have here delivered concerning the Foundation of the Alkahest
and
Mercury of Philosophers to be one, seeing I have on my side not only
Experience,
but also the Testimony of worthy Sons of the Art, that they do both
proceed
from the first Chaos, before Art hath undertaken to work upon it: But
here
the difference comes, one is prepared in a way agreeable to Nature, the
other Artificial; and consequently really divested from the Generative
Power, being drawn beyond the Predestination of its Natural Seed; the
exact
Example of which may be seen in a Grain of Wheat, when it is
Artificially
Prepared and Fermented, and so drawn into Spirit, in which Work the
Seminal
and Generative Virtue is wholly destroyed: For here there is made an
Artificial
Solution of the Seed not into Elements but Secondary Principles; and by
this violent way of Dissolution &#8216;tis divested of its Metallic Seed, and
Consequently made unfit for the Act of Generation, as was showed just
now
in the Example of the Grain of Wheat: So by consequence must being a
considerable <br>
Difference at their Respective Ends. </p>
  <p>Yet nevertheless both these as they arise from one Universal
Fountain
there may be some likeness in them and for this Reason the Description
dos in some Sense resemble the one and the other, that few have been
able
to distinguish the true difference, and the more by the shifting
Speeches
of Writers, who confound the one with the other, that so the Artist may
be easily entangled, because they have not so much as differenced them
in Name, nature or Operation; for Van Helmont says, that the liquor
Alkahest
dissolves every Visible and Tangible Matter into the first Ens,
preserving
its power, which Words preserving its Power is also attributed to the
Mercury
of the Philosophers; other Philosophers say, Our Water is a Fire, and
stronger
than any Fire for it reduces the Body of Gold into a mere Spirit, which
the Common Fire could never be able to do; the like also says
Artephius;
the very same thing is by others attributes to the Alkahest: Helmont
says
that as there is but one Fire in the World, so there is but one Liquor
in the World, no other partaking in Quality with it; and Geber says,
the
most high hath given us the Knowledge of this Water, which light the
Candle,
gives Light to Houses and yields abundance of Riches: It would be too
tedious
to enumerate the Parallels of this kind concerning the Alkahest and
Mercury
of the Philosophers: so that &#8216;tis very difficult for the unskillful and
unwary to distinguish their true differences, which is mostly to be
Comprehended
from those Words, where &#8216;tis said, the one is a work of Nature, the
other
of Art; so are they different in appearance, for as a late Author says,
that I may prevent a Common Error, viz. the confounding our Natural
Dissolvent
with our Circulated Salt or Alkahest some Ignorant Boasters who neither
know the one, nor the other, having taught that they are both the same,
I shall go so far as to show the Difference, that no Tyro but may
effectually
distinguish them in his Theory. Know therefrom and Note well this short
distinction, there is no Affinity between them either in Matter or
Operation:
They differ in Matter, as much as one Species forth from another, the
one
being Metalline, the other Saline: They differ in their Operation, as
much
as Love and Wrath; the one in Love Preserving, the other in Wrath
Destroying,
Life and Motion. </p>
  <p>This Author by his good leave speaks right in the Operation, but
strains
the String too far concerning the matter, and so cause errors on the
other
Hand, equal to those they would Reform, thereby making many to grope
for
the Door of Entrance, or middle way, which leads directly to the Path
of
Truth: For be sure as they proceed from one Matter, both Universal,
there
is something of Assimilation in them; for as much as they are both
performed
by way of Solution and Coagulation, both tedious and difficult in
searching
out; and the Subject Matter so far exalted from its former state, as
that
it becomes a Work of Wonder; and for certain they must have something
of
likeness, or else those Artists were very ignorant, who gave them one
Demonstration,
calling them by the like name, as Fiery Water and Watery Fire, Immortal
and Homogeneous Essences, Alkahest, which is all Ghost or Spirit, the
first
End of Salts, and have attributed Supernatural Virtue to both; and from
these and such like Universal Terms and Names, &#8216;tis very easy for the
Searcher
to be deceived. </p>
  <p>Wherefore I shall now come to give you a clear and general
Account,
wherein they agree, and wherein they disagree, and then show you the
Reason,
why they are thus described, and then give you the true and proper
signification
of the word Alkahest, and why Helmont gave the Liquor this Name; for I
have taken some pains after the Inquiry thereof, so that I am able to
render
a Satisfactory Reason: </p>
  <p>First of all I shall Instance in some particulars, wherein they
agree:
First, the Mercury of the Philosophers and this Circulated Salt agrees,
in that they are both Universal, one for the Graduation and Exaltation
of Metals, the other for Dissolving all Bodies: Secondly, They agree in
this, that as one preserved the Seed in order to Multiplication by
Generation,
so the other preserves the Crasis and Medicinal Virtue of Species in
order
for healing; for in the Dissolution it admits of Nothing to fly away in
Fume: Thirdly, They agree in this, the one is the Emblem of Man&#8217;s
Regeneration
and eternal Salvation, the other of Man&#8217;s Dissolution and Destruction;
for in the Preparation they are both to be seen: Fourthly, They both
agree
in the Penetration of Bodies; the one enters to the very Central Life
of
them in order to the Multiplication, the other pierces to their very
Center
in order to their separation and Division; for it separates between
their
Central Mercury and Sulphur: Fifthly, they agree in the Matter and
Manner
of Preparation, so as to the matter they both Proceed from the first
Ens
of Salts, and as to the manner, &#8216;tis by Solution and Intervening
Coagulation,
till brought to an exalted Perfection: Sixthly and Lastly, They agree
in
that they are both made from the Universal Chaos, as also in the manner
of their Composition; for the Mercury of the Philosophers is Compounded
of Sulphur and Mercury; but the Liquor Alkahest of Salt and Fire and
Blood;
and both brought to such an Indissoluble Bond of Love and Unity, as
never
to be separated either in Love or Woe; both Homogeneous and Immortal,
and
both Universal Dissolvents: Having shown wherein they agree, I shall
now
come to speak of that wherein they disagree. </p>
  <p>First, They differ in this, whereas the Work of the Philosophers&#8217;
Mercury
is purely Natural, so the process of the Immortal Dissolvent is merely
Artificial: For as in this Work the Sulphur or Gold is exalted to the
highest
Pitch and Degree of Perfection so in the preparation of the great
Hilech
of Paracelsus, it is reduced from a Natural to a Contranatural State.
Secondly,
They disagree in this, where the Mercury of the Philosophers is an
Homogeneous
Metallic Ens Coessential in all its parts, true Mercury, of a middle
Substance
clear like pure Silver, being bright Celestial and Shining, and not so
Essential to any thing as Gold, it being its Universal Mother does
radically
congeal upon it; therefore as Trevisan says, no Menstruum is profitable
in the Philosophic Work, but that which dissolves the Body in a
Generative
way, and then recongeals upon the Body dissolved, so the Philosophers&#8217;
Solution of the Body is a Congelation of the Spirit; and upon this
Account
they have rejected all those Solutions, as Sophistical, where the
Dissolvent
and Dissolved remain not Permanent together: Whereas the Alkahest&nbsp;
or Sal Circulatum is a Saline Liquor, and therefore by Paracelsus
sometimes
called the Liquor of Salts and doth Dissolve Bodies, but remains not
with
them, being as easy separable from them, as the Spirit of Sulphur is
from
Oil. Thirdly, There is a Disagreement between the Mercury of the
Philosophers
and Liquor Alkahest in the manner of their Operation and Action on
Bodies,
for the Mercury dissolves Gold and all Precious Stones and Pearls by
way
of Generation, and Exaltation, for the Life and Virtue is Multiplied,
and
they may be reduced to their first Form in greater Virtue and Beauty,
and
of more Value to the Metallurgist and Jeweler, but the Liquor Alkahest
dissolves not only Gold, but also all the other Metals, by way of
Destruction,
so that the Generative Virtue is defaced and wholly obliterated, and in
this Reduction into their First Matter it gives a certain Testimony of
their Diversity, as Metals into Sulphur and Mercury, Stones into a
Saline
Liquor, and Pearls into a Milky Juice. Fourthly, They disagree in this,
the Mercury of Philosophers at the end of its Preparation will become
fixed
and Permanent abiding all the fiery Trial, in the form of a Calx, yet
as
fusible as Wax Penetrating Mercury, and other Volatile Bodies before
their
Flight and fixes them; whereas the Liquor Alkahest at its respective
end
of Preparation is a Ponderous Saline Liquor in the form of Water, which
will moisten the Hand and everything else, and as it is wholly Saline
and
Volatile it will not endure the Fire, but will remain in its form
Distilling
over in a Saline Liquor being altogether Incapable of Coagulation, and
by that means dissolves all fixed Bodies whatsoever, not into Elements
but into more simple Parts. Fifthly, their Difference consists in this,
whereas the Mercury of Philosophers is made by a remiss Fire of
Generation,
even the Aerial Life and Lunar Fire being the medium in perfecting it
by
gentle Decoction from Point to Point, which Regimen of the Fire has
been
carefully hid by all Artists, in that &#8216;tis called the Vessel of nature,
or Mercurial Vessel, Pondus Naturae; Whereas the Liquor Alkahest is
made
by the most violent Fire of separation, for the Spirit is by Violence
not
only Distilled from the Earth in Fiery form; but that is United to the
Blood, which produces that Hellish Fire that brings all Imperfect
Metals
to a greater Imperfectness, though notwithstanding it makes them the
more
Powerful and Efficacious for the expelling and rooting out of Diseases
and Infirmities, for being brought to their first Ens they dissolve and
circulate with our Juices, as being then thin and Spirituous, and so
perform
that in the curing Diseases, which in their hard and gross Natures
could
never be expected from them. Sixthly and Lastly, The Philosophers&#8217;
Mercury
and Liquor Alkahest differ in this, the one may be brought to an
Universal
medicine, the other has no Medicinal Virtues in it: For as Philalethes
says, this Mercury the renovated or newborn, may by the Philosopher be
diversely handled; for he may take it from the Fire, ad Circulate and
Cohobate
this Mercury by a Peculiar Operation, which is partly Mechanical, till
he have a most admirable, pure, subtle Spirit, in which he may dissolve
pearls and all Gems, and Multiply them or his Red Stone, before it be
united
with a metal in Projection, for the making of Aurum Potabile: and in
this
mercury, thus Circulated, is doubtless the Mystery of the never fading
Light, which I have actually seen, but yet not Practically made. In a
word,
every one who hath this exuberate Mercury hath indeed at Command the
subject
of Wonders, which he may employ himself in many ways, both admirably
and
pleasantly. And certainly, he that hath this, needs so Information from
another; himself now standing in the Center, he may easily view the
Circumference,
and then Operation will be, next the Spirit of God the best Guide: So
that
the Mercury of Philosophers, being brought to fixity, may be made an
Universal
Medicine, but a Menstruum, which is a Proper help or Medium to prepare
Medicines by, and in itself still remains unchangeable, being as
Starkey
says, endued with these qualities; viz. &#8216;Tis a Ponderous Liquor, being
indeed all Salt, without and Watery Phlegm; it is all Volatile being
wholly
a Spirit, without and Corporeity left in it, of no eminent Odor, for
all
things which send out a considerable odor, are for the most part of a
very
Volatile Nature, or consist of many Heterogeneities. It is not
therefore
Volatile after the manner of Spirit of Wine, Urine, or the like, which
fly at the smallest degree of heat, but (like unto a ponderous Spirit,
which yields its Phelgm in the first place) this when it hath dissolved
any Vegetable Concrete, and made it Volatile, will suffer the same by a
gentle heat of Balneum Maria, to be all separated from itself, etc. </p>
  <p>From what has been here said, concerning the Agreement and
Disagreement
of these two, I hope, the diligent Inquirer after Art will receive god
satisfaction, and for the future be freed from those doubts and Errors,
which might before occasion much Trouble and Perplexity of mind: This
was
the end I proposed to myself, throughout the whole of my discourse;
this
therefore may suffice as to this Point; I shall now proceed to speak of
the Proper Names of this Dissolvent. </p>
  <p>But by the way (reader) observe, that the Invention of this
Liquor,,
in these Parts of the World is owing to Paracelsus; thus Philalethes,
and
also adds, that among the Moors and Arabians, it hath been, and is at
this
day, commonly known to the Acuter sort of Chymists, then consequently
we
must depend, that Paracelsus did give the most significant and Proper
Names
to it, and &#8216;tis plain from Helmont&#8217;s own Writings, that he diligently
Studied
and Traced his Works, and at length through labor came to understand
them,
and amongst other things, obtained the Knowledge of such a dissolving
Menstruum,
as Paracelsus often writes of; and seeing this Liquor to contain an
homogeneous
Nature, spiritually acting, and after almost innumerable Actions still
remaining the same, Spirits being immortal) and this Liquor proving so,
he therefore not improperly called it Alkahest; although, as I shall
show
by and by, this Name doth more properly belong to the Mercury of
Philosophers,
and that, this was the design of Paracelsus in it; however, by the way,
I shall examine the derivation or Root, of this Word, which is from the
Belgian or rather High Dutch Language; in Holland or Flanders, where
Van
Helmont lived (Geest) is as much as to say in English (Spirit) and in
the
German Tongue, &#8216;tis much higher and Guttural, being expressed
(Alchahest)
which signifies (All Spirits or all Spiritual): which Word (Alchahest)
Paracelsus makes mention of in the Tenth Book of his Archidoxies.
Chapter
6 where treating of the Virtue of the members, says that the Liquor
Alchahest,
has a great power of Conserving and Comforting the Liver, and
consequently
of Preserving it from the Dropsy, and all such as arise from the defect
of the Liver, and if the Liver is dissolved or broken, it stands in the
Place of a new Liver: The Process thereof is this, it must be resolved
from its Coagulated state, and Coagulated again into a Transmuted Form,
as the Process, of Coagulation and Dissolution Teaches. This Passage is
the only Place, wherein Paracelsus has made use of this Name, it being
not to be found elsewhere in all his Writings, so that &#8216;tis plain to us
that Helmont has borrowed this Name from him, therefore we must
according
to Reason and Experience consider, whether Paracelsus meant this Liquor
or not; because the Process set down, vizt. Solution and Coagulation
are
alike and Common, (as hath already been touched at), not only to
Preparation
of both these but likewise to most Chymical Magisteries. </p>
  <p>Now the Liver is the Fountain of the Blood, and is the seat of
Life
next the heart, the Blood being there Prepared for a further
Elaboration
and Purification, in order to give the Body, its Nourishment for the
Production
of Seed, and Consequently for the maintaining of Life, etc. And &#8216;tis
plain
by experience; that this Liquor will by greater length of time,
dissolve
all mixt Beings by its Active, Thin, Spirituous Penetrative, Dissolving
and Homegeneous Nature, in a Natural degree of Heat equal to that of
the
Liver, and separate them into their distinct Substances, suffering not
any thing to fly away in Air or Fume; so that to me here arises the
difficulty
to think, how this should work that different Effect, of healing and
restoring
the Liver, and not rather dissolve it, as it does other mixed beings:
The
doubt is beyond my reason at present to give an Answer to, and I
suppose
will remain so forever for I do not so much as once intend to do an
Experiment,
to try its Virtues in this Case; having, besides what is already
offered,
two Substantial Reasons against it; the First is, that this Liquor
being
difficult to be prepared, would be too costly to be administered by way
of Medicine; for a Reasonable Practice would soon diminish a
considerable
Quantity, so that this great Treasure would in little time, be
exhausted
and come to nothing, if given by way of Medicine, whereas &#8216;tis
perpetual
by way of Menstruum: The Second is, that the Philosophers give no
direction
for the Exhibition of the White Stone inwardly, but in Epilepsies and
Palsies,
and other Diseases of the Brain, which is under the dominion of the
Moon,
much less its White Oil but for Externals, as Leprosies, Scabs,
Virulent
Ulcers, Fistulas, Cancers, Noli me Tangere, etc., and the like; how
they
should then dare to exhibit a Spirit so Active and Fiery, yet much more
Crude than these, I know not; neither indeed can I be made to believe,
that ever Helmont or any other of the Adepts, did ever once so much as
make use of it by way of Medicine, and Consequently could not be this
Liquor,
which Paracelsus meant, where he speaks of the Cure of the Liver, but
rather
of the Grand Elixir. </p>
  <p>But &#8216;tis abundantly more probable, that they served themselves
therewith
in the Preparations, of Drugs and all kind of species, in order to
bring
them to Magisteries, Arcana&#8217;s, Essences, and Quintessences, which have
a superlative Virtue, especially from the Metalline and Mineral
Kingdom;
because what is resolved by it retains their healing Faculty; so from
these
Considerations I can&#8217;t Conceive that Paracelsus, where he speaks of the
Restoring of the Liver, that he meant the Circulatum Minus, or this
Liquor,
so that &#8216;tis altogether undemonstrable, that this single Dissolving
Menstruum
should be a safe and good Medicine, and consequently should Cure the
Dropsy
as is easy to be gathered from the foregoing Words of Paracelsus, that
his Alkahest really was Medicinal; for he expressly says, of the Liver
were broken or destroyed, it would be in place of a new Liver; now from
the foregoing Considerations, this Liquor can&#8217;t be said to be a safe
and
good Medicine, &#8216;tis therefore abundantly more probable that Paracelsus
by the Word Alcahest meant the great Elixir, that being all Spirits, a
Quintessence, divested of all the Elements, and consequently of all
Earthly
and Corporal Qualities; for if the Grand Elixir were not Spiritual it
would
never Transmute; for by this Spiritual Act, it works three Effects,
first
Penetration and Dilation; secondly by Fermentation and Contraction;
thirdly
by the Acts of the two former, the combustible Sulphurs are separated,
the pure ones manifested with additional Tincture and Permanency so
Helmont
finding his dissolving Menstruum Spiritual might easily mistake the
Words
of Paracelsus, and call it Alkahest, and indeed the Name is no ways
Improper,
although not used for this Liquor by Paracelsus, unless Paracelsus was
guilty of speaking one thing and meaning another, as Helmont himself
sometimes
is; as I can prove from these following Words. The Liquor Alchahest
(says
he) Reduces all sensible and Tangible bodies into their first matter,
Preserving
the Power of their Seed; which as you have all along heard it doth not;
but their Medicinal Virtue of his Alchahest, as Paracelsus does of his.
  </p>
  <p>From hence it may be clearly Conceived, what I have inserted in my
former
Doctrine, that the Philosophers were many of them guilty of
interweaving
these secrets together, and calling them, by one Name, for &#8216;tis clear,
that Helmont called this dissolving Menstruum the Liquor Alchahest, yet
says it preserves the seminal Virtue, when as Paracelsus by this
Passage
meant the Grand Elixir; and the more evident in this, in that he has
given
other names to this dissolving Menstruum, and those mostly used by him
are the great Hilech and Sal Circulatum; for these are generally to be
traced through his Writings, and &#8216;tis easy to be discerned, that he
puts
a great distinction between this dissolving Liquor and the Mercury of
Philosophers;
for the Liquor, he calls Circulatum Minus and Mercury of Philosophers
Circulatum
Majus as is plainly to be Proved from the Process given, where he
saith,
thou must extract the first Ens of Mercury by Spirit of Wine, and it
will
come over in a Liquid substance which (says he) is called by the
Philosophers
a most sharp Metalline Acetum, and by us in our Archidoxes Circulatum
Majus.
Archidox Lib. 10, Chapter 4. </p>
  <p>This Distinction and Process cannot be rightly understood by any,
but
an Adeptus Duplicatus for to the obtaining of this Spirit of Wine the
Work
is one, and is Performed by the concurring help of an Assistant;
otherwise
&#8216;twill be impossible to be obtained but being gotten, the difference
Consists
in the Forcible way of dissolving the Body and the Natural by the
Spirit
of Wine, to extract the first Ens of Mercury, in which the Blood is
united
and Cleansed, and so brought to the gentle or Benignent Fire of Nature,
which is one with Central Salt Nitre and also the Magical Sol; for it
unites
to the Center with a wonderful Fermentive Power: Now this Spirit of
Mercury,
or Mercurial Fire and Oil, is by Artephius not improperly called the
Vinegar
of the Mountains, and by Paracelsus the most sharp Metalline Acetum;
for
it performs that which common Fire could never do, vizt. Dissolves the
Body in Preservation of the Form, and brings it to a Spirit, to be
exalted
aloft in the Air, where Celestial Purity, and the strengthening
Multiplicative
Virtue is; that Spirit, will again return to and unite with the Body,
which
Circulation is continued till the Universal Mercury, has extracted the
Universal Sulphur, and then is it truly and properly called the
Circulatum
Majus, or Alchahest, as thou pleaseth, the Name being proper to the
Elixir
itself, as may be plainly discerned from the foregoing Passage of the
same
Author, where he tells you, that when it has overcome its Like, it
becomes
a Medicine for the Liver, excelling all other Medicines; and towards
the
end Adds, Verily should the Liver itself be broken or dissolved yet
this
stands in the place of the whole Liver, no otherwise than of it had
never
been broken or dissolved as aforehinted: So that the Medicine (from the
Authors own Words), by which the Liver is cured is no other than
Mercury
Prepared, Sublimed, Vivified into a new Life; and having passed the
gates
of Death comes to be united into a twofold Life, Terrestrial and
Celestial,
and so becomes that Medicinal Tincture, which is a true Emblem of Man&#8217;s
Spiritual Restoration, and is in a far higher degree of perfection than
this Circulated Salt can be conceived to be; seeing it may be so highly
exalted, as to be brought to an Elixir of Spirits, which in a Minute
penetrates
the Center of Bodies, being a Perfect Concatenation of an Incombustible
fire and light, which will admit of an endless Multiplication, being
each
time advanced in Virtue, Power and Spirituality; so that it becomes a
Medicine
not only for Man, but also for metals, making them both Perfect and
Permanent,
the which this wrathful Liquor cannot perform. </p>
  <p>For this great Magistery hath in it the Exalted Virtue and
Universality
of Light, a Quintessence or Medicine of the highest Purity in the three
Kingdoms of Nature, Animal, Vegetable or Mineral; therefore may be
properly
said to be a Medicine for the Liver, this being a Member or Part; which
so much concerns the Life of man: Now this will manifest itself here a
Medicine above all Medicines in order to restore firm Sanity: And that
it may be yet more plainly conceived, that Paracelsus spoke concerning
the Philosophers Tincture, I will quote the Words of the famous Arabian
Prince Geber in his 4th Book , Chapter 11. There is a Medicine (says
he)
of a twofold Nature of the third order, yet but one in Essence and
manner
of working (afterwards cunningly added) there is notwithstanding an
Addition
of a Citrine Colored Sulphur, which is perfected by a most clean
substance
if fixed Sulphur: Behold how its like is overcome after the first
Preparation.
This plainly shows that the like, which is to be overcome, is the very
same, that Paracelsus spoke of, as I have experimental Reason to
believe:
This from the Testimony of Dornaeus and Ludovicus de Comitibus, is also
confirmed to be that of the Great Elixir. </p>
  <p>Concerning its Spirituality, I shall add a Passage or two more for
the
greater Confirmation of what is here said: Basil Valentine (in his Las
Will and Testament and Allegorical Expressions between the Holy Trinity
and the Philosophers&#8217; Stone), Compares his Mercury to God the Father,
as
being a Spiritual Body; and the Philosophers&#8217; Sulphur or Gold to God
the
Son, who is God and man, which Sulphur must dye and rise again for its
Brothers&#8217; and Sisters&#8217; sake, being then a glorious Body, redeeming and
Tinging them to Eternal Life: and when these two come together saith
he,
they are called Mercury Duplicate; from whence proceeds our third
Substance,
which is our Glorified and fixed Sol, the Philosophers Stone, or
Spiritual
Essence of the Philosophers, called the Triune Stone, proceeding from
Two,
Water and Spirit, Animal and Vegetable in the mercury and the Mineral
living
Sulphur of Sol, which are Three, Two, and yet but One. Now observe,
this
Author&#8217;s Mercury Duplicate is the same (Like) with that of Geber and
Paracelsus,
which the Mercury will overcome, and then it becomes the Medicine or
Alchahest
spoken of. </p>
  <p>Thus having given you some Account and Reason, of the Names
imposed
by Authors on this Liquor, I shall now come to give you some Reason for
our Additional Name, viz. Trifertes Sagani, which is as Proper a Name
for
this Liquor, as any given by the Adepts, it being Spirits born in and
Predominant
over the fire, nay it inhabits the fire, even that fire that hath power
to dissolve the four Elements and Reduce them to its own Nature of
Universality.
Now this Liquor being thus Prepared is a Compleat Key to the Medicinal
Art, and doth open the Treasury of Medicines in the three Kingdoms of
Nature,
in a way succedeanous to nothing but the great Elixir. </p>
  <p>But seeing the use of this Liquor is manifold and various and will
require
a whole Chapter, I shall omit speaking of it here and refer you to the
next; where its virtues are fully shown; and come a little to consider
the Exercise of a laborious Searcher, which he meets withal in his
search:
the first Exercise is to come to the knowledge of a true Subject Matter
which is very difficult: for the Philosophers Words concerning it are
so
obscure and hidden, and the Matter involved in such Tropes and
Metaphors,
that it requires a more than ordinary help to come to a right
understanding
to distinguish rightly and truly and genuinely what the Matter is,
which
beyond all Control is candidly done in these Sheets. </p>
  <p>The second Difficulty that the Laborer meets withal, is to
distinguish
between true Books and those which are false and Sophistically Written,
which indeed is a Labyrinth, equally as difficult as the former
concerning
the Matter; For a false Author is like a wrong Guide upon a Journey,
for
if in the beginning of the same, He goes but a few steps in a wrong
Path,
and then follows the same, may in the Conclusion be led clear contrary
to his designed end, and indeed it is of greater Consequence in search,
because there are few or none to be met with in all our Course, that
can
direct to the right way: Now there is in Scripture a Curse pronounced
on
all those, who put the Blind out of his way, which Curse will take hold
on all those Sophistical Writers, in that there is no Blindness greater
than the Spiritual Blindness, whether in things Natural or Divine, and
therefore &#8216;tis a very great difficulty to distinguish them asunder,
which
being done the false are to be shunned as much as the Devil himself,
who
is the Author of all Imposture. </p>
  <p>A Third Difficulty is after you distinguish Authors, to come to
some
knowledge and Understanding of the true, concerning the Scope and
Intention
of their Writing, both as to Theory and Practice; which indeed is a
Difficulty
surmounting the former, for these Reasons: The first is their
Circumlocutions
and large Descriptions of things when as indeed it may be comprehended
in little Compass; the second is their Multiplicity of Repetitions of
one
and the same thing, only with some variation of Words, only to amuse
the
Reader: The third is by such voluminous Writings they have the more
room
and Liberty to Confound their Operations, speaking of one thing where
they
ought to speak of another; by which Preposterous manner of Writing the
Searcher can&#8217;t fail of being bewildered; this is not a Fault about the
Operations only, but also about the time of the Operation, which causes
Abundance of difficult Thoughts in the Operator, and makes him many
times
think those things concerning Time, which are neither Probable in
Nature,
nor possible for Art to Perform: For what is to be gathered from the
most
concurring Writings of them all is, that the Matter can&#8217;t pass the
first
Dissolution in less than five Months and the riper and higher Matters
are
carried, the sooner and shorter will an Operation be, for in Conclusion
it may be brought to the Work of a Month, then of a Week, and lastly of
a day, which Operations being misplaced cause this Error; for there is
great difference between that Operation, where there is ripe ferment
and
that where there is not; for &#8216;tis very difficult to bring bread to rise
without Yeast. </p>
  <p>Now the last and most Principal difficulty of all is, the want of
Substance
or Money of your own to carry on your search and Labors; for though you
have never so much knowledge and have overcome all the other
difficulties,
yet without money to build Furnaces, buy Glasses and Convenient
Vessels,
and Coals, you can&#8217;t go forward with your Operations; I make no doubt
but
this was the state of the Cleine Boer, and of that Worthy and famous
Count
Bernard Earl of Trevisan, to detain him three years from the Possession
of the magistery after he had the true Knowledge of it, and it has been
the Case of many a Worthy Artist, I am sure it has been very often
mine,
which is the most difficult and deplorable Case of all, having a large
Family and their subsisting while you are in search, for it requires
the
whole man, and so takes him from all other business, and if he makes a
Friend, he is obtained with the greatest of all difficulties; for you
must
first discover your Subject; secondly your Operations; thirdly the
Time;
as to the two former, let him be never so ignorant, he must be the
Judge,
and if he does not like it, you then loose both your Friend and your
Art
to boot; and indeed &#8216;tis very difficult when a man goes about such a
thing
to know who is Qualified for it, or what use he will make of it when
obtained:
And as to the time, he is very nice in it, if he do except of your
Proposals,
and to have an Operation performed to every Punctilio; and if it is not
you must expect Reprimands, and sometimes the loss of your Friend, who,
lying as it were, on a Bed of ease, little knows the hardship,
Fatigues,
labors, Losses and Disappointment, which the Artist sustained and is
subject
to; neither indeed dares he to open the same for fear lest they should
become his Enemies; these things being rightly Considered may be reason
sufficient to deter many a Worthy Laborer from his Search, to the great
loss and Detriment of Art: That none of these, or such like
difficulties
may be thy Portion, O Reader! Is the desire of him, who shall Conclude
this Chapter with his Well-wishes to every Sincere Searcher after Art. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter V</font></b> <br>
  <b><font size="+1">The Use of the Liquor Alkahest, Circulatum Minus
or
Great Hilech of Helmont and Parcelsus</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <a name="5"></a> <br>
&nbsp;
  <p>In this Chapter, I shall come to show you the Use of the
Circulatum
Minus, Liquor Alkahest, or Sal Circulatum of Helmont and Paracelsus in
dissolving Universally all sublunary Concretes into their first Matter,
none excepted, for nothing opposes it, but its Compeer or Water, and
the
Central heart, or Mercury; the one destroys it, and the other remains
untouched
by its Activity; for all other Beings are so Essentially dissolved, as
that they may be brought over the Helm [distilled], in their true
Essences;
nay by Cohobation they may be reduced to an Elementary Water; therefore
for the good and Benefit of Mankind, I could be heartily glad that the
excellency and Utility of this Menstruum, were better known, since
Helmont,
Paracelsus and Starkey, put such Noble Encomiums on it: for as the
first
of these says, In Nature there is but one Fire, which is our consuming
Vulcan, none other partaking in Virtue and Quality with it, all the
true
Adepti have an undeniable Proof of, which indeed is far more powerful;
than any Common Fire, for what will remain there, as unconquerable, is
by this Liquor destroyed and Altered radically and fundamentally; the
Mechanical
Practice with it is thus. </p>
  <p>Let this Liquor or Fire be distilled from any Metal soft and
Imperfect,
and it doth at first or second time leave them in a fusible Substance
like
Wax, of which the Sulphur or Rincture is dissolvable in the best Spirit
of Wine, and from the residue (being kept three days in a vaporating
heat)
Mercury quick and running may be separated, the same may be done in
harder
Metals, yea, in Perfect metals, in a longer time, by oftener reiterated
Cohobations. </p>
  <p>But this Fire being once distilled from Mercury Vulgar, it leaves
it
Coagulated and Fixed, so then it will endure the Test of Saturn; It&#8217;s
left
spongious like to a Pumice-stone but heavy like Turbith Minerals,
brittle
and therefore without difficulty Pulverizable, which then Cohobated
with
Water, distilled from Whites of Eggs it causes that distilled Water to
stink, but becomes of the Color of the best Coral, whence it is
denominated
Arcanum Coralinum. </p>
  <p>This Fire if it be distilled from any Gem or Stone subtly
Pulverized,
it turns into a mere Salt of equal Weight to the Gem or Stone; Pearls
it
resolves into a Milk, which is their first Ens; so also Crabs Eyes (as
they are Vulgarly called, being otherwise no Eyes, but Stones found in
the head of the Crab), and all Vegetable Stones, as Peach-stones,
Date-stones,
or the like. </p>
  <p>In a Word, this Fire or Liquor resolves all Vegetables, Animals
and
Minerals, into their first Ens, and in such Concretes as Contain in
them
Heterogenities, it doth discover and sever (that it makes separable)
the
same. </p>
  <p>But observe, this dissolution is not performed like that, which is
made
with the Mercury of the Philosophers for that dissolves Bodies by way
of
Generation, but this by way of Destruction, in that it separates
between
the Central Mercury, and Sulphur of Bodies, and although they are very
prevalent as to Medicines, yet are they totally bereaved and divested
from
any generative Power; so that it will be in vain fir any to expect,
Generation
therefrom, seeing the Liquor itself is prepared by the way of Wrath;
and
so it dissolves Bodies; therefore called Ignis Gehenna; the Fire of
hell;
but the medicines prepared by it surpassing others, I shall give you
some
Particular Examples of it, first of such, as are of an Inferior Rand,
as
to Preparation, and then of those more difficult and Noble. </p>
  <p>Now for small Experiments and for the more ready use of the
Alchahest,
&#8216;tis good to provide yourself of Convenient Vessels, as small as
Egg-glasses,
thick and strong, with short Necks, wide mouths, and Ground stopper
exactly
fitted; also small Retorts with Ground stoppers, which may serve both
for
Digestion and Distillation; but for great Experiments and larger
quantities
I advise you to use my hard Metal Jugs made sizable with very long
Necks,
well tried which is by putting them into a Pail or Tub of Water within
two inches up to the mouth and then blow your Breath; if there be any
Air
hole, the Water will bubble, then not fit for use: These serve for
Digestion,
Dissolution, and also Distillation, because you may work them either
standing
upright, or lying down, as your occasion shall require; being thus
provided
with Vessels you may begin your Solutions first on Vegetables; which it
does Resolve into their first liquid Matter, distinguishing in them all
the Heterogenities by several Colors, and distinct places, one above
another,;
in which Resolution there always seats itself in a Distinct place a
small
Liquor, Eminently distinguishable from the rest in Color, in which the
Crasis of the whole Herb, Tree or Seed, doth reside: in which no less
of
Virtue, but an Exalting of the same by many degrees, only whatever
virulency
is in the Crude Concrete, by this Operation is wholly extinct, with a
Preservation
nothwithstanding of all the specific Virtue, appertaining to the
Concrete
in its simplicity. </p>
  <p>And furthermore &#8216;tis to be observed, you may dissolve all Herbs
into
their Principles, liquid without Sediment, of which part will be
unctuous
and fat, especially in Trees, Gums, Seeds and many Roots; and part
Aqueous
in which the Volatile Salt of the Concrete will appear to the taste,
the
Liquor with its own Oil you may Circulate into an Essential Salt, which
is indeed the firs Ens of the Concrete; but if you would have things
done
in a lesser time, make your Dissolutions in a stronger heat, and
distill
over your Liquor with the dissolved Body in a stronger heat, and
distill
over your Liquor with the dissolved Body in a due fire, so will the
Oiliness
be wholly turned into a Saline Spirit, which in a distillation by Bath
will come over in various Colors the Crasis separating itself from the
Phlegm (both by Color, Taste and Smell, as also by its Time of Coming
over
the helm distinguishable) and your Liquor left behind at bottom, as
much
in quantity, and as Effectual in virtue, as before; as, for example,
This
Work does happily succeed with Balm, or any other vegetable which is
better
dry than Green) which being only Macerated some hours in a gentle
warmth,
you will see it so dissolved in such a wonderful manner, that you
cannot
sufficiently admire the Effect; the Alkahest being separated from it
(or
brought over according to the former direction) out of Balm you have a
Noble specific against the Gout, Hypochondriac Melancholy, Claenture,
and
Deleria in Fevers: out of Colcocynthida an excellent Febrifuge; and out
of Cedar an Ens for long life: For which take Wood Cedar 3 iiij of the
Dissolvent and an equal Proportion and digest 24 hours, and it will be
wholly dissolved in the Conservation of even the very same odor, he
Liquor
being separated, it will freely dissolve in Spirit of Wine, or if you
first
dissolve them in Spirit of Wine, the Liquor will dissolve with it;
digest
and draw off the Spirit of Wine, and then you may distill off the
Alkahest
with the Essence of the Concrete, and separate the, as you have been
directed:
Observe the Dissolution of this for long Life, must be in a gentle heat
like that of the Sun in he Spring and after that digested in a like
heat
till the Oyl and Water be united into an Essential Salt: I should
advise
all Vegetables to be prepared in the like nature, if you desire, to
have
their eminent Virtue, without losing those peculiar Excellencies, which
depend on the Vita Ultima of the Concrete, otherwise a speedier
Preparation
makes the Medicine no less Effectual for Curing Diseases, though less
powerful
as to long Life, must be in a gentle heat like that of the Sun in the
Spring
and after that digested in a like heat till the Oil and Water be united
into an Essential Salt; I should advise all Vegetables to be prepared
in
the like Nature, if you desire, to have their Eminent Virtue, without
losing
those peculiar Excellencies, which depend on the Vita Ultima of the
Concrete,
otherwise a speedier Preparation makes the medicine no less Effectual
for
Curing Diseases, though less powerful as to long Life: out of Myrrh,
Aloes
and Saffron, an Excellent Antihectical Medicine, as also against
Lypothymies,
Deliquias, Convulsions, and Palsies. Thus much for Vegetable, I shall
now
give you a short Survey of Stones, Pearl and Coral, and lastly of
Minerals:
Though I must confess by the way, that if your Liquor does radically
dissolve
a charcoal, it is a certain sign, that it is true, as if it did
dissolve
Gold itself; for according to Helmont, the Work succeeds well upon
Charcoal;
but &#8216;tis admirable to see how the Operations will be changed and varied
according to the Degree of Fire, and diuturnity of digestion. </p>
  <p>Take of the Stone Ludus, in Subtle Powder, and of the Dissolvent
QV,
digest 24 hours then distill, and &#8216;twill be converted wholly into a
Salt,
which being Calcined will in a cold Moist Air easily run per deliq.:
which
will certainly Cure the Stone with all its Attendants. </p>
  <p>Take of Pearl, what quantity you please; and of the Liquor, equal
Proportion,
which being therein immersed, &#8216;twill dissolve into a Mucilage (a gentle
Maceration of some hours preceding) Resolvable in Spirits of Wine. The
same may be done on Crabs Eyes, but sooner: &#8216;Tis an excellent Medicine,
for comforting the heart, giving strength to the very Marrow and Bones:
Coral so dissolved is a Medicine that restores sense to those bereaved
of it, Comforts the Brain, Memory and Heart, expelling sadness and
Melancholy,
and making a cheerful and healthy Constitution. </p>
  <p>Observe with this Liquor you must use no acid Spirit, or Salt, or
Corrosive
of whatever sort. For wherever such things are used, as Mediums whether
for Mercury, or any other, they must be well washed off and made sweet
before the Alkahest is put on; therefore in Sulphur fine Flowers are
the
best: Of these take what quatity you please, of Liquor Equal Proportion
Digest for the space of two days, and afterwards Cohobate twice or
thrice.
They will come over the Helm in form of a very Red Oil, separable from
the Liquor by a separating Glass: Excellent in the Consumption, Coughs,
and the like; &#8216;tis not only a Preservative of Man&#8217;s body but also of
Beer,
Wines and other Liqours. </p>
  <p>If you Abstract this Liquor from the Calx of Lead, 24 hours
digestion
being premised; you will have the Lead so Reserated unlocked or opened,
as that in Spirit of Wine, &#8216;twill easily let go its Sanguineous and
sweet
Tincture: which is the Magistery of lead, and an Excellent Medicine for
all burnings and Inflammations whatsoever. </p>
  <p>Take of Flowers of Antimony, sublimed with Sal Armoniac and
dulcified,
or of the Alcohol of Antimony, which is better, one Ounce of the Liquor
Alkahest, three Ounces, oput them into a Retort, and digest six hours,
at furthest then still off the Dissolvent, and you will hve a true
Medicine,
which Infallibly Cures the Dropsie. </p>
  <p>Take of Precipitate very well edulcorated, made after what manner
you
please, one ounce, of the Dissolvent two Ounces, and having been
digested
24 hours Distill, and you&#8217;ll have a fixed Precipitate, working by
stool,
sweat and Urine, a certain Remedy for the Leprosy, Scurvy, Kings&#8217; Evil,
Gout, and Pox. </p>
  <p>Take of the Calx of Gold one ounce, of the Liquor two Ounces;
digest
in a Viol with a long Neck ( or one of the Egg-glasses, before
described
which is better) for three days, oruntil it will give forth no more
Tincture;
the pour off all that is dissolved into a Retort, and with a gentle
Fire
draw off the Liquor, and you&#8217;ll find the Gold dissolved in the Bottom
of
the Retort, which you may either dissolve in Spirit of Wine, or let run
in the Air per deliq.; and you have a true Aurum Potabile: The same
Process
is to be observed in Silver. </p>
  <p>Another; Take Gold calcined into fine Atoms, or Laminated into
thin
Leaves, one ounce, of the Liquor Alkahest, three ounces; put them into
a Retort with a ground stopper, and let them remain in the heat of a
gentle
Bath a few days, or until the Gold be dissolved without Sediment, the
Liquor
then being distilled from it, leaves it in the form of a Salt fusible
which
Cohobated often with the Liquor, is made Volatile, and comes over in
two
Liquors, White and Red; the Red is the Hemating Tincture, and the White
may be reduced into a White Mercurial Body, after the dissolving Liquor
is separated from the same: Thus Gold the King of Metals, of Nature
most
fixed in Corrosives, Test and Cupel enduring all kinds of Martyrdoms
without
the least diminution, even the most exquisite Trial of Vulcan is by
this
Liquor or Fire, wholly mastered and Conquered so as to be brought into
its Mineral Ends, which is the highest Preparation of Gold, that can be
made by means of this Liquor, being its Fifth Essence, and is of Power
to cure the most deplorable Diseases, to which the nature of Man is
subject;
but the Magistery of Gold, which is the first Preparation of it, by
means
of this Liquor, is a most eminent Medicine against all Malignant
Fevers,
the Pestilence, palsies, the Plague, etc. In the like manner you
Prepared
the Fifth Essence of Silver; but this following Medicine, is equal if
not
superior to either. </p>
  <p>The Sweet Oil of Venus: Take of the best Danzig or Roman Vitriol,
and
Calcine it till it be thoroughly wasted in the Fire what will waste;
then
dulcify the Colcothar with Distilled Rain Water and dry it very well,
to
the Vitriol thus prepared, add of the Fire or Liquor, equal Parts for
it
will be dissolved easily and Friendly, distill off your Liquor, and
pour
it back again; and thus Cohobate it at the least 12 or 15 times, so
will
all the Body of the Colcothar be brought over the Helm in the form of a
Green Liquor; digest this same in the gentle heat of a bath, for about
a Month and then distill it in a slow Fire, so will the whole metalline
substance of the Venus, come over, leaving the Liquor below in the
Retort,
in its entire Pondus and Virtue: To this Liquor or Spirit put an equal
quantity of Sal Armoniack, dissolved in as much Water as will dissolve
it, so shall you separate the Green Liquor from a White Sediment, which
White Sediment, will give a White Metal, as fixed as Silver and will
abide
the Test of Saturn, but yet formally distinct from Silver which thou
(if
a Philosopher) shalt easily perceived however as good to a Metallurgist
as the best Silver; the green Liquor dry up in a Viol Glass, by
evaporating
all the Moisture, for it is the Sulphur of Venus mixed with the Sal
Armoniack,
by which (Note that) it is fixed so that it will abide all Fire, this
Sulphur
extract with the most pure Spirit of Wine, which will dissolve it,
leaving
the Sal Armoniack; distil away then from it (thus dissolved) your
Spirit
of Wine, and you have left a very fragrant green Oil of Venus, which is
Sulphur Essensicated, by these Operations, as sweet to taste as the
best
Honey, than which Nature hath not a more Sovereign Remedy for most (not
to say all) Diseases: this is the true Nepenthe of Philosophers,
causing
certain Rest, and assuaging all Pains, but ever after sleep leaving the
Party either sensibly amended (in more violent and diurnal Diseases) or
quite well in the less rigid Maladies: Thus also from Lapis Hematitis
and
Spelter may be had Noble Medicaments, also from the Sulphur of
Antimony,
and more especially from Common Mercury; for if you Cohobate the Liquor
so long till its body is brought over and proceeding all things as in
the
Sulphur of Venus, you have a Medicine that will effect whatever can be
desired by either Patient of Doctor. </p>
  <p>Thus having given you a short Landscape (as it were) of this
Liquor,
I shall here pass it by at present, and Conclude. </p>
