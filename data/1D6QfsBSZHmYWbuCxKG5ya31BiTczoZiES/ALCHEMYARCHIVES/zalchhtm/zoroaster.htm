<p>Dry water from the Philosophers Clouds! Look for it, and be sure to
have it, for it is the key to inaccessibles, and those locks that otherwise
would keep thee out. <i>Chorus omnium</i>.
<p>It is a middle nature between fixt, and not fixt, and partakes of a
Sulphur Azurine. <i>Isaacus Flander, &amp; Gymnosophiste apud Philostratum</i>.
<p>It is a Raw, Cooling, Feminine fire, and expects its Impregnation from
a masculine, Solar Sulphur. <i>Aristot. Arabs</i>.
<p>It is the only compleat Angell to the Infern, or Bottom of the earth,
where all the Treasures are hid. <i>Apollo apud Homerum in Hymno ad Mercurium</i>.
<p>All that are conversant in this Art, learn from Experience, and all
good Authors, That the true matter and subject of this stone, has Gold
and Silver in potentiality, and Argent vive naturally, or actually, Which
Gold and Silver are much better than those men commonly see and handle,
because these are alive and can increase; the other dead: And if this could
not be effected, the matter would never be brought to this perfection,
which this art promises, which is indeed so efficacious as to perfect Imperfect
metals. But this same invisible Gold or Silver, which by this Magistery
is exalted to so sublime a degree, cannot communicate its perfection to
imperfect metals, without the help and service of vulgar Gold and Silver.
<i>Adeptus
Aonymus apud Combachium</i>.
<p>The Sun and the Moon must be in Conjunction that they may absolve perfect
generation. <i>Arnoldus Villanovan in flore florum</i>.
<p>No corruption , that is, no mutation or passage of one form into another
can be made, without the mediation of Putrefaction, (which is the sole
mean and way to Generation) nor any putrefaction be had, without some Mercury,
or Argent vive, which is the special delator, or conductor of the vegetant
faculty, called by the Philosophers, The viridity of Nature.
<p><i>Anonymi&nbsp; Adepti</i> --- Sal, umen, et Spiritus Universi. Minerals
have their Roots in the Ayre, their Heads and Tops in the earth. Our Mercury
is Aerial; look at it therefore in the Ayre, and in the Earth. <i>Calid
Aegyptius</i>.
<p>It is the potentiall vapor of metals. <i>Aegidius de Vadis</i>.
<p>Our Stone is the conjunction of Sol and Luna, till Sol has drawne the
substance of Luna to his nature and colour. <i>Lullii Codicillus</i>.
<p>And this is done by the inward fire, or Sulphur of the stone. <i>Idem
ibidem</i>.
<p>Minerals made of living Mercury, and living Sulphur, are to be chosen:
worke with them sweetly, not swiftly with precipitance. <i>Dastinus</i>.
<p>The thing that works perfection in metals is the substance of Argent
vive and Sulphur proportionall mixt, by long and temperate Decoction inspissate
and fixt in a Wombe of clean earth; with conservation of his radicall not
corrumpent humidity, wrought up to a solid substance, with due ignition
fusible and under the hammer Extensible. <i>Geber, de Investig: cap. 2</i>.
<p>Those that know the Mercury and Sulphur of the Philosophers: know that
they are made of pure Gold and the finest Luna and Argent vive, which are
dayly seen, and loot upon, from which our Argent vive is elicited. <i>Berardus
de Granpag. 1. Manuscr. Vetustiss</i>.
<p>Our Stone is the potentiall vapor of Metal; and how to get this, thou
must be very carefull and wary. <i>Aegidius de Vadis</i>.
<p>Our Water is a lustral, or expiating essence, and the cause efficient
of the clarity of the whole body, and medicine. Two things it works in
the earth: It washes it, it tinges it: As it washes, it is Water; as it
tinges, it is Ayre. <i>Ludus puerorum</i>.
<p>The ancients call’d our Argent vive <i>Aqua Sicca</i>, Dry water. <i>Tauladan</i>.
<p>It is apparent, what that Argent vive is that Geber points at, in his
Summa to be taken, namely, the Cleane substance of fixt Mercury, shut up
in Sol and Luna. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>Argent vive in its first root is compounded of white earth, subtile,
and sulphureous strongly mingled with a bright and clear water, united
with such an union, <i>per minima</i>, till the moyst be tempered with
the drie, and the drie with the moyst equally into one Intimate substance,
that will not rest on a plain Surface, nor adhere to the Tangent because
of its Siccity, which has altered and cohabited the Aqueity in it. But
it is homogeneous in its nature: for it either remains all in the fire,
and fixt; or else, all flyes away in fume; because it is Incombsutible,
and Aereal. And this is a signe of perfection. <i>Richardus Anglicus Philosoph.
Vetustus</i>.
<p><i>Mercurius crudus</i>, Mercury crude, dissolves bodyes, and reduces
them to their material prima: but the <i>Mercurius corpurum</i> the Mercurie
of Bodyes cannot do it. <i>Holcot Anglus</i>.
<p>The Mercury of the Philosophers is compounded of Mercury Crude and the
Mercury of Bodyes, by an Union Intimate and Inseperable, as there is in
Simple water mixt with Simple water. <i>Libanius Gallus apud Trithemius</i>.
<p>By a Lucid Key he opened secret places, otherwise inaccessible, and
within was great store of Silver and Gold. <i>Mercuris Antiquoruum apud
Homerum</i>.

<p>When our materials are Amalgamated, that Amalgam, to conceale it from
the unworthy, is call’d by Philosophers our Venus, our Gold, The earth
of Magnesia, the whole Compound. <i>Jodocus Greverius</i>.
<p>I tell thee that our Semen is the true Salamander, conceived by fire,
nursed by fire, and perfected by fire. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>The matter which we need to our worke is not the Hyle, or the Chaos,
but the <i>materia prima propinqua</i>, The first matter in a propinquity,
that is, the second; which in animals is Sperm, in vegetals Seed, in minerals
Sulphur, and Argent vive. <i>Ripleus Anglus, Sendivogius Polonus</i>.
<p>Sulphur perfectly clarified and dealbate, Philosophers call Their foliated
Earth. <i>Vogelius manuscriptus</i>.
<p>The work yet Crude is call’d our Argent vive, water permanent, Our Lead,
our Argent vive, water permanent, Our Lead, Our Saturn, the spittle of
Luna, our Jupiter. When better decocted, then it is Argent, then Magnesia,
and white Sulphur. When it is Red, it’s call’d Auripigment, Corall, Gold,
Ferment, a Stone, a Lucid Water of celestiall colour. <i>Adeptus Anonymus,
Desiderabile &amp;c</i>.
<p><i>Magnesia</i> is That whole mixture from whence is drawn our humidity
call’d Argent vive. <i>Ludus puerorum</i>.
<p>The Dragon is the Sulphur that is Extracted from the Bodyes by the magistery.
<i>Nich.
Flamellus Annot. In Democratum</i>.
<p>The liquor of Lunary, the vegetable mercury, the quintessence, and water
Ardent, are all one thing. With our liquor of Lunary, known but to few,
is our Solution made, and our potable Gold; but without it, not at all.
<i>Rosarium
Philosoph</i>.
<p>Trouble not yourself about the diversity of names, and the regiment
o the work; for if we would make Sol, we must take Sol, if Luna, Luna for
our Ferment. <i>Dastinus</i>.
<p>Our Black Materia dealbated is called the Terra Foliata, Ashes of Ashes,
ferment of ferment, and white Sulphur enduring the fire: and yet without
Ferment neither Sol nor Luna will come forth but from what that’s as good
as nothing. <i>Lib. Durum verborum</i>.
<p>Our Stone in the beginning is called water; when the body is dissolved,
Ayre, or Wind; when it tends to consolidation, then it is named Earth,
and when it is perfect and fixt, it is called Fire. <i>Dominus Vobiscum</i>.
<p>Argent Vive is called Wind, that is, Aereal Argent Vive, the strongest
vinegar, poyson Tingent, Virgins Milk, Burning fire, burning worse than
the fire of Hell. <i>Incertus Author</i>.
<p>The Stone is called Adrop, that is Saturnus; because, as Saturn is the
chiefest of the Planets; So our mercuriall Saturnine Stone, is the highest
and most pretious of Stones. <i>Saturninus</i>.
<p>Our compound is called by Philosophers White earth when it is white;
and Red when it is Red. <i>Scotus de Bufone</i>.
<p>When our limous earth is whitened, we call it Yharit, that is, Silver;
and when it is made red we call it Temeinchum, that is, Gold: And it is
whitenesse that tinges Venus and makes it Yharit, and that rednesse that
tinges Yharit, and makes it Temeinchum, that is, Gold. <i>Calid Egyptius,
Philosophus nobilis.</i>
<p>Our matter is call’d the elementall Stone, because the four elements
are extracted from it: The mineral Stone, because it is made only of minerals:
The vegetable Stone, because it is nourisht and augmented, which are the
properties of the vegetative Soul: The Animal Stone, because it is refresht
with sweet odors, and corrupted with stinking.&nbsp; <i>Scotus de Bufone</i>.
<p>Our Stone is called Adrop, that is, Saturn. <i>Speculum Arnaldi</i>.
<p>Our Stone after its putrefaction is called Magnesia, and in the putrefaction
it is called Saturnus, <i>Idem ibidem.</i>
<p>All the metals when they are prepared by Art, then they are call’d Sol,
Luna, Mercurius, &amp;c.&nbsp; For before they were onely Gold, Silver,
and Quicksilver. <i>Marcilius Ficinus</i>.
<p>The Incombustible Grain of metals, is their radicall humidity, and is
as a certain Seed of Sol, and Luna, which nature has inserted to them,
that upon opportunity they may be Excocted to Sol and Luna by Nature in
a long, by Art in a very short, Time. <i>Vogelius</i>.
<p><i>Azot</i> is a fift Essence, a body of itself Subsistent differing
from all the Elements, and all the Elementals both in Matter and Form,
Nature and Virtue, having nothing of the Corruptible: and it is called
a fift Essence because it is Extracted from four, and has in it no Elemental
motion, as other Elemental bodyes, Tinging and purifying, metallic bodyes
by its Colour, and keeping from Corruption all other Bodyes that are joyn’d
with it. <i>Incertus Author</i>.
<p><i>Terra Alba</i>, White Earth, White Sulphur, White Fume, Auripigment,
Magnesia, and Ethel, signifie the same, in this Art. <i>Tertia Synodus

<p>Thou needest but one thing, namely Water, and one operation, to wit
Decoction, to White and Red, in one vessell, understand of one kind. <i>Alphid

<p>Although the wise men have varied names and perplext their sayings,
yet they allwayes would have us think but of One Thing, one Disposition,
one Way, The wise men know this one thing; and, that is one, they have
often proved. <i>Morienus Eremita Hierosolymitanus</i>.
<p>In a multiplicity of things our art is not perfected. For it is one
stone, one med’cine in which consists the whole magistery: to which we
add nothing extraneous, nor take away any thing; but only, on our preparation
that, that is superfluous. <i>Idem Eremita</i>.
<p>White and Red proceed from The same Root without any other Kind intervenient.
For it dissolves, and conjoins It selfe, makes it selfe Black and Citrine,
white and red, espouses Itselfe, conceives, brings forth, and does all

<p>If you Govern Our Brasse, Our Venus, with Our Water, then you shall
find all that is said; otherwise, you do nothing. <i>Turba Philosoph</i>.
<p>There is no way for the Rectifying of Bodies intirely and completely

<p>Of Sol and Luna thou mayst make the perfect med’cin without Separation
of the Elements, without labour, without fear, without danger; they need
a long time, but they are safe. <i>Isaacus Flander. Lib. 2. mineral</i>.
<p>The Ancients labour’d in the Amalgamation of Sol and Luna, which is
indeed the most perfect worke, and the Care little. <i>Idem ibidem</i>.
<p>Mercury alone perfects the works, in it we find all that we need, to
it we adde nothing extraneous. Sol and Luna are not Extraneous to one another,
because they in the beginning of the work are reduced into their first
nature (that is, Mercury), therefore from It they took their beginning.
<i>Divus
Thom: Aquinas, cap. 3</i>.
<p>Wherefore I counsel you my friends, that you work not on any one thing
but Sol and Luna, reducing them into their first matter, that is, Our Sulphur
and Argent vive. <i>Lulli Codicillus</i>.
<p>Of Sol vulgar, &amp; Luna vulgar, both Solute there is a preparation
of mercury vulgar. Of those Three without any other Species, the Physic-Stone
is generated, and of no other can it be made by the Wit of Nature. <i>Incertus.
Incipiens. Desiderabile</i>.
<p>The difference betwixt the Solar and the Lunar Tincture in This: This
Solar contains Solar Sulphur; The Lunar, Lunar Sulphur. <i>Albertus Magnus</i>.
<p>The Stone is one: Yet This one, is not one in Number, but in kind. <i>Scala
Philosoph</i>.
<p>Rebis is the first part of the work; Elixir the Second; Tincture the
Third; and Medicin the fourth. Therefore it appears, That to Azoth Elixir
is required, because Elixir in this work precedes Azoth; For from Elixir,
Azoth is extracted. But Azoth is that which is extracted by our Mercury
from the bodyes dissolved; and That is counted the Maturer. <i>Desiderabile</i>.
<p>Elixir is no other then the body resolved into Mercurial Water, after
which resolution Azoth is extracted out of it, that is, a Spirituous Animated
Essence. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>In one Thing for species, and Two Individuals It consists and is perfected,
frst to White, then to Red, finally by increasing the fire. <i>Petrus Valentiae</i>.
<p>In the first Regimen, set the Crude and pure Elements upon an Easie
fire, that they may be mingled and joyn’d together; govern them so that
they may be dessicate, or dried; and all will be black; from which blacknesse
an Occult Whitenesse is drawn, &amp; afterwards a Redness by decoction.
And when it is in the perfect White, it is in Dust Impalpable. <i>Zininus</i>.
<p>The Generation of metals and the Philosophers stone is to conjoin proper
principles; videlicet Man with Woman, Active with Passive, Sulphur with
mercury, that so Generation may ensue Corruption. Argent Vive is the Recipient
of the Form, and Gold the very Philosophers Stone.&nbsp; <i>Saturninus</i>.
<p>The whole work consists in Sol, Luna, and Mercury. <i>Tersim</i>.
<p>Gold and Silver are metals, out of which the Golden ad Silver Elixirs
are made. <i>Tauladan</i>.
<p>Tinge with Gold and Silver: because Gold gives the Golde; and Silver,
the Silver Nature and Colour.<i> Richardus Anglicus</i>.
<p>It is necessary that the Stone before it be made Elixir, be extracted
from the nature of Two bodyes. <i>Monachus</i>.
<p>The fire ought to be very soft, till the Spirit be separated from the
Body, ascending into black clouds above the body: By a Spirit Crude, a
spirit Digested is Extracted from the body dissolved. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>Take the Stone Suspended upon the Sea, his name is <i>Victor</i>; with
him slay the living, and enliven the slain; for in his power are Death,
and Life. <i>Incognitus qui incipit Exemplum Scientiae.</i>
<p>Our Mercury is drawn from the Calx of Metalls by putrefaction, till
the Compound put off one nature, and put on another. And so by such Operations,
is made the Mercury of the Philosophers. <i>Jacobus de Sancto Saturnino</i>.

<p><b><i><font size=+1>ECHO V.</font></i></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Operations of Art in her Ministery and Attendance

<p>Nature begins all her Actions from Separation. Mortification is the
first step to Separation, and the only way to that End: for, as long as
bodies remain in their old Origin, Separaton without putrefaction, or mortification,
cannot reach them. <i>Anonymous Adeptus</i>.
<p>Amalgama which is the first Work, is made with one of Sol, and four
of Mercury. And this is the beginning of the Work the Philosophers have
called by many names, Our <i>Venus</i>, Our Gold, The Earth of Magnesia,
The whole Compound. <i>Jodocus Greverius</i>.
<p>In the first Decoction, when thou art blacking, there will rise from
the Earth a certain humidity of Argent vive like a Cloud, and will stick
to the upper part of thy vacant Oval by its sides, which thou must let
alone untoucht. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>Blacknesse like that of the blackest Coal, is the Secret of True Dissolution.
<i>Raym.
Lullius in Clavicula</i>.
<p>Turn thy clouds into raine to water thy Earth, and make it fruitful.
This Reduction of clouds to raine, is called by some <i>Cauda Draconis</i>,
the Dragons Taile: and others say, that new Mercury is to be added. <i>Idem
Greverius</i>.
<p>The bodyes are first to be Subtiliated by Disolution, which is the first
Degree of the Work. And this Dissolution is nothing else, but that bodyes
be return’d into Mercury and Sulphur from whence they took their Original.
But no other body can be resolved into Mercury, but a Metallic, consisting
of Mercury and Sulphur.
<p>The Spirit of metals is part of Our Stone; and That we must evacuate
from the bodys of metals: namely from the two perfect by putrefaction,
division of Elements, and their fixation. <i>Raym. Lullius</i>.
<p>When the matter Ascends by Wind, that is, by fume, the Philosophers
call it Sublimation: when it is cast into the bottom of the vessel, and
Converted into Water, they call it Solution, or Distillation: When the
Earth is Inspissate, they say it is Corruption: and when it begins to change
from black, they call it Ablution. Extraction of Water from the Earth,
and turning it on the Earth again, till the earth putrefie, and be cleare
again, is the Summe of our magistery. And when the Philosophers saw their
Water diminished, and their Earth increased, they called it Ceration; Then,
when all became Earth, they called their Work Congelation; and when White,
Calcination. <i>Monachus. ex manuscripto vetustiss.</i>
<p>Dissolution begets blacknesse, Reduction Whitenesse, Fixion Citrinity,
Inceration Redness, Blackness is the Earth, Whiteness the Water, Citrinity
the Ayre, Rednesse the fire. <i>Anonymus</i>.
<p>Solution turnes the Stone into its Materia prima, that is, into Water:
Ablution into Ayre: Conjunction into fire: Fixion into earth Spiritual
and Tingent, <i>Scala Philosoph</i>.
<p>Putrefaction is made by a most Gentle fire hot and moyst, and no other,
so that nothing Ascend. Desponsation and Conception is made by a kind putridnesse
in the bottom of the vessel. <i>Rosarium</i>.
<p>Burn with Water, wash with Fire, <i>Idem ibidem</i>.
<p>Labour not to make thy Mercury Diaphan that is, into a cleare, Transparent

<p>The Earth does not Germinate without frequent Irrigation, nor receive
Irrigation without Dessication. Therefore at every Turn after desiccation

<p>As in this work in its first Composition, nothing that is extraneous

<p>The magistery of the Philosophers does not need a Commistion of any
extraneous thing; but out of the proper seed metallic cast into Philosophical
earth prepared, it produces a Stone infinitely multiplicable, if it be

<p>Our fire is Mineral, Equall, Continuall. It vapors not unless excited
too much. It partakes of Sulphur. It is taken from some other Thing than
the material, it breaks down all before it, Dissolves Congeales, and Calcines:
That Fire, with a Fire Remisse, perfects the whole work, and makes all
the right Sublimations. <i>Pontanus uti et in Epistola</i>.
<p>The Fire against Nature must torment the bodyes, That is the Dragon

<p>All along, the fire must be gentle till the Water be congealed in Whitenesse.
A stronger heat given, the Mercury flyes the fire by reason of its Frigiditie.
Therefore keep thy fire soft, till thou hast a white Congelation. <i>Benedictus</i>.
<p>By a Temperate fire a little quantity of the Drie Dessicates the moyst,
and this by little and little, and not suddainly. And by how much the Stone
has more of the Ablution, so much the more Intense is the whitenesse. <i>Scotus
de Bufone</i>.
<p>The fire of the first Degree, that is of Solution, and Putrefaction,
ought to be so weak, that Nothing Ascend of the nature to be Sublimed,
and so a gentle fire gives Mercury Ingresse into the body, when with a
strong one all is destroyed. <i>Saturninus</i>.

understand this of the first White after Nutrition. <i>Anonym</i>.
<p>Make thy Contritions with fire, not with thy hads. <i>Argent vive</i>
is fierie, and burns the bodyes more then fire; whatever Metallic body

<p>Although we always speak of Slow-fire, yet in earnest we think, that

<p><b><i>The Colours.</i></b></center>

<p>When the matter has stood for the space of forty days in a moderate
heat, there will begin to appear above, a blacknesse like to pitch, which
is the <i>Caput Corvi</i> of the Philosophers, and the wise men’s Mercury.
<i>Alanus</i>.
<p>Blacknesse once seen, thou mayst be sure a True Conjunction of the principles
is made.
<p>Before the clear Spendent colour comes, all the Colours in the world
will appear and disappear: then thou shalt see an admirable whitenesse,
that will seem to thee, the True whitenesse, and yet it is not so. Before
the True whitenesse comes, thou shalt see all about in the margin of the
Glass as it were Oriental pearls, in the matter of the Stone, glittering
like the Eyes of fishes, and when thou seest the Matter white as Snow,
and shining like oriental gemms, The white stone is then perfect. Let it
cool of Itself. <i>Isaacus Flander</i>.
<p>The Colours are only Three, the others that come are called the middle
Colours, that vanish away: But the black, White, and Red are Eminent and
lasting Scenes. <i>Trithemius</i>.
<p>When in the work blacknesse appears, know that thou hast found the right
way of working. Then rejoice, for God has given thee a very Great and pretious
Gift. <i>Phoenix</i>.
<p>In the hour of Conjunction wonderfull things present themselves apparent
to us. For all the Colours that can be Imagined, appear in the work; and
the Imperfect body is colour’d with a firm Coloration, by mediation of
the Ferment. <i>Arnaldus in Flore Florum</i>.

<p>This work cannot be perfected in a little space of Time; therefore the
Artist must be patient. <i>Greverius</i>.
<p>The shortest Time of the preparation is the Circuit and Revolution of
the Greater Luminary. For the Stone must be kept in the fire, till it cannot
an more be changed from one nature to another, from one Colour to another,
but become like the Reddest blood running like wax in the fire, and yet
diminishing nothing at all. <i>Laurentius Ventura, Italus</i>.
<p>We take a year for our Expectation; for our Calx, in lesse Time, cannot
be made. <i>Ripleus</i>.
<p>The Philosophers seeing a sort of whitenesse come, after a long Time,
of the Colour of Ashes, called it Incineration, or Dealbation. <i>Idem</i>.
<p>In purification there cannot be a determianted Time, but in ninety dayes
the Red work is completed.
<p>Variation of Times happens from the quantity of the med’cin, and according
to the Industry of the Artist. <i>Monach</i>.
<p>After the first fifty dayes, the caput Corvi shows itself; fromthence
in an hundred and fifty the Dove is made; and in another hundred and fifty,
the Red is wrought. Till you come up to whiteness, use a Gentle fire. <i>Saturnius</i>.
<p>When it has stood under an Eclipse for five months, and the Darknesse
recedes, the light supervening, Encrease your fire. Scala philos. <i>Riplieus

<p>The Time for perfection of Elixir is at least one year. <i>Rosarius</i>.
<p>Be patient in extracting thy Tincture; for haste is the first Error
of Art, and burns all. <i>Anonymus</i>.
<p>In forty dayes and nights, after the True purification of the Stone,
the work to White is compleat: because in the purification there cannot
be a Set time; but in ninety dayes and nights, the work to the Red is perfected.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Fermentation of The Stone.</font></b></center>

<p>Ferment is made after the Ortus, or Birth of the Infant. And Ferment
is nothing but meat Disposed to a Convertibility into the Essence of the
Infant, that all may be made of one nature. This fermentation Cibal, ought
to be <i>de sua propria natura</i> of the Infant’s own nature, and assimilated
to it; else there will be no Incorporation. No conversion into Sulphur.
<i>Lullius
in Codicil</i>.
<p>Ferment must not be of this or that, but of Sol or Luna only: For we
look for nothing but that the Stone be turned into his like and from them
is the whole Temperament: nor is it Ferment before the Bodyes be turned
into their first matter. <i>Vogelius</i>.
<p>In fermentation see that the Summe of the volatile do not exceed the
Summe of the fixt: otherwise the Sponsal Ligament of the body would be
put to flight. But if a little of the Sulphur be cast upon much of the
body, so that it has the dominion over it, it soon converts it into Dust;
the Colour whereof is as the Colour of the body, one ounce of the Dust
four of the Body. <i>Anonymus Incipiens Desiderabile</i>.
<p>Know that there is no Ferment, but Sol &amp; Luna. <i>Arnaldus in Flore

<p>Fermentation is the Animation of the Stone. <i>Clangor</i>.

<p>It is impossible to multiply the central salt without Gold, But the
Sons of Art only know the True seed of Metalls. <i>Novum lumen Chymicum</i>.
<p>Multiplication is either Virtual; Such as is made by Alteration, by
Dissolving and Congealing; or Quantitative, by Apposition of new Matter.
<i>Scotus
de Bufone</i>.
<p>The Quantitative is Nothing else but the Augmentation of the Tincture
from one pondus <i>ad infinitum</i>: So that the Worke is never again to
be begune, and this Without the Diminuation of its force. <i>Incertus</i>.
<center>
<p><b><i>Projection upon Metalls.</i></b></center>

<p>No Projection of the Red stone but upon Luna. <i>Isaac Flander</i>.
<p>If thou wouldst make Projection upon Jupiter, melt it in a Crucible,
and put to one pound of Jupiter one ounce of pure Luna, and melt them together;
then cast on it thy White Tincture, and the Jupiter animation of the Stone.
<i>Clangor</i>.
<p>If Thou put to It but Little of Ferment thou shalt have but little Tincture.
<i>Dastinus</i>.
<p>When the stone is liquefied by Decoction. It must then be Coagulated,
But this Coagulation is made with Ferment, or with its owne body, which
is the same thing.
<p>When the Anima Candida is perfectly risen, the Artist must joyn it,
the same moment, with its body: For the Anima without its body cannot be
held. But such a Union must be made by mediation of the Spirit: because
the Anima cannot have life in the body nor perseverance in it, but by the
Spirit: And such an Union and Conjunction is the end of the Work. The Soul
must be joined with the First body whence it was, and with no other; which
if thou dost not, thou shalt faile of thy purpose, as many Ignorants have
done who knew not this Secret. <i>Margarita Novella</i>.
<p>Spirits are fugitive, until such Time as bodyes are joined with them,
and help them to fight against the fire: and yet those parts agree but
little, unless with good Operation, and Continued labour: because the nature
of the Anima is Tendent Upwards, where the Centre of the Anima is. And
who is he of those that have tried, that was able to Conjoyne Two Things
that are Diverse, whose Centers too are Divers? unless after the Conversion
shall be transmuted into True Luna, less or more, according to the Spirituality
of the stone? And if thou would’st Work with thy Red Stone, project it
upon Luna Molten, and thou shalt finde the purest Sol.
<p>Cast thy medicin upon thy Ferment, then it is frangible as Glasse. Take
that frangible masse, and cast it upon metals first clear’d, and thou shalt
have metal of proofe. <i>Ripleus Anglus</i>.
<p>This Secret thou must not be Ignorant of, That our Red man, and his

<p><b><font size=+1>The Virtues of the Great Elixir, or Astral Medicin.</font></b></center>

<p>This Chymic-powder, whether you call it the Philosophers stone or susile
Salt; Sulphur, Elixir, or potable Gold, has in it a wonderful power over
the Three Dimensions of Nature, the Animal, Vegetal, and Mineral Kinds.
Thus first on the Animal: Every Animal, brute, or man, it brings to Sanity
from every disease within. Or without. All defections from natural Symmetry
are reduced by it to Temperament, because there is in it a perfect Equation
of Elements separate from their dregs, and all Sulphurous Adustions. On
the Vegetal; It acts wonderfully by Exciting their Genital power in their
seasons, or out of them, to a most florid vegetation. In the mineral; Every
Imperfect metallic body, Lead, Tin, Copper, common Argent vive, it transformes
to Silver, or Gold better then the natural in every probat. Pretious Stones
too; the Emerald, the Carbuncle, the Anthrax, or Rubie, Chrysoprase, Adamant,
Chrysolite, and many others, are made by it. <i>Rob. Vallensis</i>.
<p>By long Inquisition, Labour, and certain Experience, we have found one
medicin, by which, that which is hard may be made soft, and that which
is soft may be made hard, that which is fugitive be fixt, that which is
foul and dark, be Illustrated with a wonderfull splendor. <i>Geber Arabs</i>.
<p>Wrincles of the face, every litura or spot, gray haires, to takes away,

above five hundred years. <i>Geber</i>.
<p>Arteph the Jew when he wrote his book, affirmes he had lived a thousand
and five and twenty years. <i>Rogerius Bacho, de Artis mirabili potestate</i>.
<p>By its Ethereal, humid, oleous fire, it gives us youth; by its Tincture,
it transforms the Imperfect, to the perfect Mines; makes various sorts
of pretious stones, with the most pretious malleable Glasse. <i>Charta

<p>Fear God, you that look after this Sacred Skill: For that which you
seek is not a small Thing, but the Treasure of Treasures, the Gift of God,
most Excellent, and Admirable. <i>Bacaser in Synod. Pythag</i>.
<p>He that is Idle and negligent in the Reading of books, shall never be
prompt in the preparation of Things: for one book opens another, one speech
explicates another; and that which in one is Incompleat, in another is
completed. And how can he that refuses the Theorie apply himselfe to the
regular practice? <i>Arnaldus in Rosario</i>.
<p>Follow it with the Instance of labour, but first exercise thyself in
a diuturnity of Intense Imagination: for so thou mayst find the compleat
Elixir; but without that, never at all. <i>Idem. Lib. 2 Rosar</i>.
<p>Serious Study (our Doctors say) removes Ignorance, and brings the human
Intellect up to the knowledge of Every Thing. <i>Richardus Anglicus</i>.
<p>Think not to find out our profound sense by the sound of the letter:
for he that takes the sound of the words, and has not the hidden sense
too, shall lose his Labour, and his Cost. <i>Aurora</i>.
<p>If thou canst Resolve even the least of our Sayings, the Greatest cannot
be hid from thee. <i>Aurora Consurgens prolog</i>.
<p>All wisdome is from God, and was always with him from eternity. Whosoever
therefore loves wisdome, let him seek it, and begge it from him: for he
is the Altitude and profundity of all Science, the Treasure of all wisedome;
because from him, in him, and by him all things are, and without his will
nothing can be: To whom be glory for evermore. <i>Albertus Magnus de Alchymia</i>.
<p>It is impossible that This should be beknown unless it be known from
God, or form a master. <i>Rosarium Philosoph</i>.
<p>The Artist must be prudent, and of a witt naturally subtile, &amp; profound,
and excellent in the Ability to Judge. He must be learned likewise; that
what his wit reaches not to, that may be supplied by his learning: For
whosoever aspires to this Science, and is not a philosopher, is a fool.
He must be Industrious, Laborious, and of a Constant mind; not precipitant;
but very patient: For all hastiness (saies our Geber) is from the Devill.
He must be at his owne election, and free; not held by other businesses
and cares.
<p>He must have enough money for his practice, and books enough for his
study. <i>Theobald Hogheland</i>.
<p>And above all he must be jealous over the Secret, and keep it severely
to himselfe. <i>Idem Hogheland</i>.
<p>I adjure thee bythe living God, whosoever thou art that hast this book
in thy hands, that thou offer it not to any of the Unworthy; such as are
Fools, Tyrants, Opressors, Covetous, Proud persons, Adulterers, oft Amorato’s
or such whose belly is their God. Place thy hope in the Lord God, work
in his feare to the good of man, expecting the blessing from above. <i>Jodoc:

<p>Thou who hast this book, hide it in the bosome, discover it to none,
