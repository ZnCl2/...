  <p><br>
In the name of the Lord, holy and compassionate: this is the story of
how Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu&#8217;awiyya came into possession of the
spiritual
riches handed down from Stephanos of Alexandria to Morienus, the aged
recluse,
as is written in the book of Ghalib, bondsman of Yazid ibn Mu&#8217;awiyya. </p>
  <p>Now Ghalib was Yazid&#8217;s faithful servant, entrusted with all his
master&#8217;s
possessions, and in time, it is said, became faithful servant likewise
to Yazid&#8217;s son Khalid. </p>
  <p>Ghalib relates as follows how Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu&#8217;awiyya
sought
out Morienus the Greek, who lived as a recluse in the mountains of
Jerusalem.
One day, Khalid went abroad to a place called Dirmanam. He was
assiduous
in his quest for the Major Work, continually inquiring after any and
all
whom he supposed to be privy to this operation, and on this occasion a
certain man came to him and desired to speak with him. Speaking of this
operation, and on this occasion a certain man came to him and desired
to
speak with him. Hearing of this, Khalid bid the man come before him. He
saluted Khalid, and Khalid returned his greeting. </p>
  <p>The fellow then spoke thus to Khalid: "I dwell in the mountains of
Jerusalem,
and I have come to you, O King, with delightful news. Never has anyone
before me given any king such cause to rejoice". </p>
  <p>"And what is this news?", asked Khalid. </p>
  <p>He replied: "I have heard many say that it is you who continually
seek
after the operation which the philosophers call the Major Work. I will
bring to you the knowledge of it through a certain Romaean, who lives
as
a recluse in the mountains of Jerusalem, but whose dwelling place I
well
know. He sends large amounts of gold to Jerusalem every year". </p>
  <p>Khalid said to him: "If I find that you have told the truth, I
will
reward you with whatever you may ask. But if you have lied, you may
expect
the worst". </p>
  <p>"Well", the fellow replied, "so be it". </p>
  <p>Then Khalid rejoiced greatly and commanded that the man be
rewarded
with gifts and raiment and much else, as he had promised him. And the
king
commanded me along with many other of his servants to go with him. </p>
  <p>And so we set out. After wasting much time going from one place to
another,
in hopes of chancing upon the recluse, we did indeed find him. He was
tall
of stature, though aged, and although lean, so noble of countenance and
visage that he was a marvel to behold. Yet he wore a hair shirt, the
marks
of which were borne on his skin. We rejoiced to have found him and
spoke
kindly to him, at last persuading him with sweet words to relent, and
brought
him back with us to our own country, there presenting him to King
Khalid. </p>
  <p>Never before had we seen the king so pleased by anything. At last
he
turned to me and asked what had befallen us in going and coming, and I
told him the story from beginning to end. Then the king regarded the
aged
man we had brought and wished to know by what name he was called. </p>
  <p>The elder replied: "I am called Morienus the Greek". </p>
  <p>And Khalid asked: "How long is it now that you have dwelt as a
recluse
in these mountains?". </p>
  <p>He replied: "I began my retreat four years ago after the death of
King
Herakleios". [645 AD] </p>
  <p>Then the king bade Morienus be seated, and himself arose to give
Morienus
a place beside him, much pleased with his reserve, modesty, and
elegance. </p>
  <p>The king said to him: "O Morienus, recluse though you be, would it
not
be better that you live in the congregation of others, rather than
alone
in the mountains?". </p>
  <p>He said: "Perhaps, O king. But the virtues I look for are in God
and
in His hand, who will do as He will. And while I grant that, as you
have
said, life might be easier for me than in the mountains, still only he
who sows shall reap, and he must reap that which he has shown. Now I
trust
that I have gained some little virtue of my own. A man cannot attain
repose
except through labors of the spirit". </p>
  <p>Then the king said: "These things are true, if said from the heart
by
one believing in God. O Morienus, I am pleased that you continue in
your
faith. I wished to see you and therefore sent for you". </p>
  <p>Morienus said to him: "You need not marvel at one such as me, a
mere
son of the race of Adam. At best, I might only be somewhat comelier,
except
that the passage of time has altered me. There are many like me among
men.
And at the end is cruel death, than which no punishment is worse; yet a
harsher punishment awaits the spirit after death. But the almighty
Creator
be our aid". </p>
  <p>The king replied: "Thus God may confound man, who is only scorned
the
more, the more he is advanced in age". </p>
  <p>Then the king commanded me to conduct Morienus to a dwelling near
the
royal palace and to fetch one of the Christian elders who might speak
with
him and comfort him with sweet words, and thus set his heart at peace.
I did so, and the king made it his custom to come twice every day to
Morienus,
sitting down with him and speaking with him, but asking him nothing
concerning
his magistery. </p>
  <p>The king often stayed long, and Morienus confided greatly in him.
Khalid
inquired repeatedly about the customs both royal and common of the
Greeks,
and about their times and histories. Never at a loss for a reply,
Morienus
retold the marvels of their deeds and discoursed expertly on their
sciences,
all matters such as the king had never before heard Nor had anyone
before
ever held such a firm place in the king&#8217;s affection as Morienus soon
came
to hold. </p>
  <p>Even Khalid addressed him: "O Morienus, know that I have long
sought
the Superior Work, but found none to counsel me in this matter.
Therefore
I earnestly request that you prepare for me some portion of your
magistery.
You shall have from me then whatever you may ask, and I will see to it
that you return to your own land, God willing. Nor need you thenceforth
have any fear of me". </p>
  <p>Morienus said to him: "O king, may God enrich you. Now I
understand
that you have sent for me only out of great need. But I disregard the
kind
assurance you added, namely that I should not fear you, inasmuch as I
have
no need to fear anyone save God alone. You have approached me as an
equal
in spirit, and now I see by your affection, excellence, and
discrimination
that one such as I should have no reason to keep from you anything of
that
which you seek, for you are indeed a man of good intentions as well as
deed and most virtuous. Very well, you have attained to your initiation
and instruction simply and with the greatest ease. May the Creator be
praised!". </p>
  <p>At this, King Khalid smiled, and then said: "The crudeness of
haste
ensnares any man, unless he be ruled by patience. I am of the house of
Mu&#8217;awiyya, and there is no strength save in great God most high". </p>
  <p>Morienus then said: "O king, may God enrich you. Now attend to the
examination
of this operation, and you will know it well and understand. Consider
it
thoroughly from beginning to end, and you will know all tings that
pertain
to it, God willing. No one will be able to perform or accomplish this
thing
this thing which you have so long sought or attain it by means of any
knowledge
unless it be through affection and gentle humility, a perfect and true
love. For this is something which God gives into the sure keeping of
his
elected servants until such time as he may prepare one to whom it may
be
handed on from among his secrets. Thus it is only the gift of God, who
chooses among his humble and obedient servants those to whom he reveals
it". </p>
  <p>Khalid said to him: "Surely we know that nothing can be done
without
the help and guidance of God, most high and eternal". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid said to me: "O Ghalib, quickly now, sit down and
write
all that we have said". </p>
  <p>Thereupon Morienus continued: "Almighty God in His power created
powerless
servants who neither undo what He has done nor advance what He holds
back,
nor can they even know anything except what he grants to them. Nor are
they able even to possess anything except by the strength that same God
has conferred upon them, nor even govern their own spirits except
insofar
and so long as He has ordained for them. And from among His servants,
He
chose to select certain ones to seek after the knowledge He had
established
that rescues him who masters it from the wretchedness of this world and
assures him riches to come, God willing. While those so chosen used to
hand down this knowledge to their own heirs, it was at last lost and
its
masters dispossessed of it when none could be found any more who knew
it.
But of the books which set forth the matter correctly there remained a
few by the ancient seers who went before us. They left their knowledge
as a legacy to their successors, whom God had chosen to become adepts
according
to the methods that had been explained truthfully and forthrightly by
their
predecessors. The ancients, however, did not refer to the matters
pertaining
to this science by their proper names, speaking instead, as we truly
know,
in circumlocutions, in order to confute fools in their evil intentions.
This they did by formulating their conviction and true sayings always
in
parables, so that only those of great wisdom and resource would be able
to uncover their true meaning. Since the ancients thus disguised this
knowledge,
those who would learn it must understand their maxims. Nor may they
draw
back from this, but must fix their faith in God and persist to the end
that he bring them to this knowledge, improve their estate, and give
them
direct, unerring access to the methods of this science". </p>
  <p>King Khalid then said: "Now well taught and well spoken, O
Morienus,
nor do I hold these precepts strange, coming as they do from a teacher
of such wisdom and years as yourself, who is willing that I should
learn
this science. Therefore explain to me clearly that which I ask of you,
sparing me needless labor over this matter which I seek from you. Tell
me whether this operation is accomplished only be a single principle or
by several". </p>
  <p>Morienus spoke: "All is truly attested by many, and I will declare
to
you that which you seek and many other matters according to testimonies
of the authorities. When you have examined these sayings and given them
much study, you will find that what the authorities taught in their
books
is true. Now in answer to your question as to whether this operation
has
one root or many, know that it has but one, and but one matter and one
substance of which and with which alone it is done, nor is anything
added
to it or subtracted to it. When certain of his disciples asked
Herakleios
what you have asked me, he told them how a single root grows into many
tings which return again to one, if they get air. Ostanes declared that
the four elements, heat, wetness, cold and dryness, are basically one,
and that certain of these four are compounded of the others, as though
some were roots of which the others are composed. The true roots are
water
and fire, and composed of these are earth and air. Also, Ostanes, said
to Maria that it is our quicksilver&nbsp; that has dominance over our
earth,
being very clear and pure, while earth is made is made of crudest
water.
And Hermes said that earth is the mother of the elements, which are
born
of her and return to her. Moses, too, said all things come of the earth
and return to it. As Hermes said, just as all things come of one, so
also
is the Great Work done with one thing and one substance. Even so does
man
contain the four elements united in his body, though God created them
variously
as dry or separate, joined and collected or scattered. But each
operation
functions in a different way, having its own color and proper
application.
It is thus that this matter is to be understood. The philosophers have
given many such confirmations". </p>
  <p>King Khalid then replied: "How can it be that the Major Work
should
have but one root and one substance? Many authorities refer to its root
by a great number of different names". </p>
  <p>Morienus said: "Its names may vary, yet I say it is but one. On
this
point I will cite the authorities to you, who will further confirm what
I have said". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Tell me all concerning the mastery of this
operation". </p>
  <p>Morienus said: "Herakleios said to certain of his disciples that
just
as the date is brought forth by the palm, so also is the palm tree
produced
of that same date, and from its root grow the shoots by which it
multiplies.
And on this point, Hermes said: consider how red is made complete by
partial
degrees of redness. Consider also red as a whole, and the full yellow,
and partial degrees of yellowness, and yellow as a whole. And likewise
full black and partial degrees of blackness, and black as a whole. As
the
shoot emerges from a grain, so also do the many branches from the tree
and the tree from its seed. A certain seer who entirely renounced the
world
also said things such as we have spoken, namely, that man is produced
of
a sperm, just as of a single grain a hundred are brought forth, from
which
a great tree grows. Thus too was woman made of one man, but then of
both
are born many children, each of a different color and appearance. Again
the seer says: consider the tailor sewing his cloth, of which he has
made
a shift or some other garment, using only the cloth. The top, the
sleeves
and the skirt are all of cloth, and even sewn with thread which is
itself
made of cloth, nothing else being required. Thus also does the Major
Work
consist in itself, requiring nothing else, the proper secret of the
philosophers.
They moreover called it everywhere by many names, concealing it thus
from
all but the wise, who set forth and greatly extol this operation. But
fools
despise it and hold it of no account, ignorant of what it is. The wise
used many terms in the books, one being "sperm", which, when converted,
becomes blood, and then is consolidated with the flesh as though part
of
it. Thus the process of generation proceeds by a succession of forms,
until
man is made. Another simile is that of the palm, on account of the
color
and natures of its fruits before they ripen. Others are such as the
tree
of bad seed, or wheat, or milk, or many other names. Though all have
but
one root, there is an operation that alters each one, giving many new
colors
and natures, hence many names. Akaifrem said truly that it is only the
multitude of terms which causes the masters of this operation to err.
But
one who knows that these terms are only like the many colors seen at
conjunction
will not stray from the true path of this operation". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid inquired further of him and said: "Now let me
know
concerning these colors how the change from one to another occurs,
whether
in a single composition, in two, or in many". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "They are made in a single stage, but their
names
increase in number as the fire increases their heat. Zosimos spoke thus
to Theosebeia: I will show you that the wise varied their maxims and
compositions
only because they wished them to be understood by men of wisdom and
prudence,
while the ignorant should remain blind to them; clearly it was for this
reason that the wise wrote variously in their books of the stages of
the
operation. There is but one stage and one path necessary for its
mastery.
Although all the authorities used different names and maxims, they
meant
to refer to but one thing, one path and one stage. Hence, O king, you
need
inquire no further on this point, since what has already been said
suffices.
The wise spoke of many compositions, masses, and colors in the manner
of
parables, by which men are always misled. Still, they did not lie, but
as they learned the craft of this operation only declared what they saw
in such a way that it should escape others". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid said: "I ask you to explain its color to me as
you
have declared its nature, truly and without allegories or similes". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "The authorities customarily first made an
essence
or alum of it and by means of it before treating anything with it.
Perhaps
it is enough that I quote Zosimus to you, who said that even though
latten
may be red at first, still you will have no profit of it until it is
whitened.
Now, be assured by the authority of Zosimos in this matter, who said to
Theosebeia that blackness is first; according to this maxim then, after
we have removed the blackness and achieved whitening with salt and
natron,
and a cold and dry substance, you call it borax, and verify Zosimos&#8217;
statement
that blackness is first, forthwith it is whitened with salt, which is
air,
and natron, which is fire, it is made red before it is finally
whitened,
which removes its blackness so that it is then changed to a very clear
red. And Maria said that when latten, or earth, is burned with sulfur
until
it softens or boils, it is turned with something so fine as existed
only
by God&#8217;s aid. And another authority said to look for one&#8217;s reward when
latten has been refined until it shines like fish eyes, for then it has
been converted to its basic nature and color. And another said: know
that
the more a substance is washed, the clearer and better it will appear,
but if it is not washed, it will not become clear nor be reduced to its
own nature. Maria also said that there is nothing which can remove from
latten, or earth, its darkness, or proper color of blackness, but
quicksilver
covers it at first, turning it white; when the latten overcomes the
quicksilver,
and reddens it. And a philosopher said that quicksilver cannot remove
from
latten the substance of its color, or change it except in appearance.
But
latten, or earth, can take on the substance of whiteness from
quicksilver,
which has a marvelous power to cause all the colors to appear after
washing,
removing blackness and impurity and rendering white, except in the case
of latten, which reddens it. And Zosimos said that only of it and with
it does anything result, nor is any tincture to be had except such as
is
of its type. Again, Andarnah said: now know why others before us have
brought
together these various parables; it is that you may see that the
beginning
of this matter attests to its end, and its end its beginning, and that
you may know that the entire thing is but one matter, having father and
mother who made it and bore it, and the matter itself is its own father
and its own mother. And Theosebeia asked: how is it possible for a
species
to deviate from its own kind? Zosimos replied: it is true that it has
departed
from it, and will revert to it". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid said: "Now having asked you concerning its nature
and
color, I wish to know further concerning the feel and mass of this
stone,
as well as its taste and the nature by which it is effected". </p>
  <p>Moreienus replied: "This stone is of delicate touch, and there is
more
mildness in its touch than in its substance. In mass it is very
weighty,
but of sweet taste, and its proper nature is aerial". </p>
  <p>Khalid said: "Tell me of its odor, before and after its
confection". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "Before confectioning, its odor is very heavy
and
foul. But an authority has said concerning is odor after confectioning
that this water, or virgin&#8217;s milk, removes from a corpse, earth, in
which
there is no more spirit, the odor which is foul like that of tombs.
Further,
an authority said that when the white spirit or milk has been made and
raised, and the residual body well prepared, so that its darkness or
blackness
is removed and that foul odor withdrawn from it, the extraction of the
spirit from the body has been accomplished. And at the moment of
conjunction
of that spirit with that body, great wonders will be seen. On this
point,
the philosophers who gathered before Maria said to her: fortunate are
you,
Maria, for the splendid mystery hidden from many has been revealed to
you". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Explain to me the different natures. How does
that
which is below, or earth, rise up, and how does that which is above, or
fire, descend, and how is one joined with the other so that they then
are
mixed in turn, and what is it that effects their mixing, and how does
that
blessed water or virgin&#8217;s milk come to reduce and cleanse things of
that
foul odor which is like the odor of tombs in which the dead are
buried?". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "On this point, Merkovisem said to Sernale: by
what
names may this matter be called? And he replied: fragrance and incense.
After its color is refined, there remains in it nothing of darkness or
foul odor". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid said: "Tell me whether this matter is very common
or
very rare". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "Now consider what an authority said, that this
magistery
is customarily accomplished with a single matter. Attend well to this
and
apply yourself to it, and you will find no contradictions among the
natures
which you will perceive. Know that sulfur and orpiment burn, but do not
long withstand combustion. Quicksilver always long withstands
combustion.
Quicksilver always long withstands combustion, while all substances
which
approximate the nature of fire burn quickly. Thus you may expect best
results
from something which burns quickly in the fire and is reduced to coals.
Nor need you ever suppose that the stones will enter into this
operation.
Try to accomplish purification without deviating from that which the
authorities
have explained and declared. If what you seek is found in the dung,
take
it. But if you do not find it, do not reach for your purse, for
anything
bought at great price is found to be false in the craft of this
operation.
Now I have explained to you and given you to know that which you have
sought.
Follow this and take care not to waste anything on this matter, for no
expense is necessary. On this point, Zosimos said: I enjoin you to
spend
nothing for this operation, particularly for the Golden Work. And again
he said: whoever has required other than this stone for the Major Work
is like a man attempting to climb a stair that has no steps, for he
cannot,
and falls flat on his face". </p>
  <p>The king asked: "Is this thing of which you speak rare, or
commonly
found?". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "As an authority has said, it is there for both
rich
and poor, for the generous and the greedy, for him who runs and him who
sits. It is cast in the streets and trampled in the dung, but let none
take pains to extract it. Fools have often wasted much zeal on the dung
in hopes of extracting it, but they have acted in ignorance. The wise
know
that this unique thing is hidden and that it is what contains the four
elements within itself, having power over them". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Tell me where the sources of this thing are,
whence
it may be gathered as there is need of it". </p>
  <p>But Morienus fell silent and, casting his gaze downward, reflected
deeply
for some time. Then he raised his head and spoke: "Truly, this matter
is
that created by God which is firmly captive within you yourself,
inseparable
from you, wherever you be, and any creature of God deprived of it will
die". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Give me further explanation in this matter". </p>
  <p>Morienus continued: "The disciples of Herakleios inquired of him,
saying:
Master, the wise men of old handed on their power to their sons and
disciples
through books. Now we earnestly request that you set forth to us
something
of that operation concerning which the ancient seers spoke so
variously.
And Herakleios responded and said: O sons of knowledge, know that the
blessed
creator most high created the world out of the four dissimilar
elements,
establishing man as most splendid in their midst". </p>
  <p>But King Khalid said: "O Morienus, explain this still further to
me". </p>
  <p>Morienus said: "What more can I tell you? For this matter comes
from
you, who are yourself its source, where it is found and whence it is
taken,
and when you see this, your zeal for it will increase. Consider this,
and
you will find that it is true". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Is any other stone like this one known to you,
by
the power of which the same may be accomplished?". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "I know no other stone like it nor having its
powers.
While the four elements are contained in this stone, it being thus like
the world in composition, yet no other stone like it in power or nature
is found in the world, nor has any of the authorities ever performed
the
operation other than by means of it. And the compositions attempted by
those using anything else in this composition will fail utterly and
come
to nothing". </p>
  <p>Then Morienus continued: "To guard you from error, I tell you
again
what I said at the beginning. Take care neither to depart from the
root,
nor seek any other form of it, for you will attain the profit and the
regard
you pursue only by means of this. There is no need for you to reduce it
or to mix anything else with it. Again I admonish you to heed well that
which we have said so far". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "O Morienus, tell me the manner of conducting
this
operation, with God&#8217;s aid". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "I will tell you, according to the terms the
authorities
have used". </p>
  <p>"Very well", said King Khalid. </p>
  <p>The Morienus said: "For the conduct of this operation, you must
have
pairing, production of offspring, pregnancy, birth, and rearing. For
union
is followed by conception, which initiates pregnancy, whereupon birth
follows.
Now the performance of this composition is likened to the generation of
man, whom the great Creator most high made not after the manner in
which
a house is constructed nor as anything else which is built by the hand
of man. For a house is built by setting one object upon another, but
man
is not made o objects. His substance, rather, before he is formed,
improves
through successive changes until the living being is made, which then
continues
from day to day and from month to month, so that the creator most high
at last finishes this his great handiwork at the appointed time of
maturity.
So also did the creator first make the seed of the four elements, and
set
for them a certain time in which they should be formed, after which
they
might be finished as he would suffer and ordain it. And this operation
is but the secret of secrets of great God most high, which he reveals
to
his prophets, whose souls he has gathered to himself in paradise. And
except
that the authorities have been, as it were, the vessel in which the
prophets
performed the composition of this matter, others would never have been
able to do so, for none before the authorities had ever seen it nor
known
whence it was, until the prophets revealed it to them. Of this you may
be sure". </p>
  <p>Morienus continued: "Now I have shown you that this operation is
at
no great remove from the living things, nor was anything over born or
endowed
with spirit or growth except for putrefaction and change of appearance.
Thus it is that an authority has said that this operation avails
nothing
until after decay. And again he said that this matter must putrefy
before
it can be poured or made fluid, without which nothing will be
attained". </p>
  <p>King Khalid asked: "What is it after putrefaction?". </p>
  <p>Moriensu replied: "It is then made that by which the great creator
most
high completes the required composition. And know that this operation
must
be done twice, and two compositions must be completed, one after the
other,
and when the second has been completed, the whole operation is ended". </p>
  <p>Whereupon King Khalid asked: "But how is it that it must be done
twice,
with two compositions? Did you not say before that this was all but one
matter, having but one path?". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "It is true that this is but one mater, having
a
single path, for its composition is the same. The one is just like the
other". </p>
  <p>And King Khalid asked: "Now, is this the composition by which you
said
the entire work was finished?". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "O king, may God enrich you. Indeed, this
composition
is not the work of the hand. This one is crucial, as so many
authorities
have had cause to lament, for they have declared that one who by means
of this knowledge discovers this composition will easily understand the
entire operation, which, however, will remain concealed from one who
does
not". </p>
  <p>Then King Khalid asked: "But what is this marvelous composition?".
  </p>
  <p>And Morienus answered: "The authorities likened it to an
alternation
of natures, a wondrous mingling of heat with cold, i.e., of fire with
water,
and wetness with dryness, i.e., of air with earth, in exact
proportions". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "O Morienus, since the hand does not perform
this
composition, how is it done?". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "According to the authorities, quicksilver and
fire
(of the stone) wash latten, or earth, and cleanse it of darkness. One
of
the authorities said that if you have the right degree of fire,
quicksilver
and fire are all you need in this composition, God willing. But as Esbo
the Slayer said, let not our hearts be corrupted for whitening latten
and
interpreting books". </p>
  <p>King Khalid then asked: "O Morienus, does a composition not
precede
putrefaction?". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "A composition does precede putrefaction, but
this
is not a true composition". </p>
  <p>"What is it then", asked Khalid. </p>
  <p>Morienus said: "It consists in extracting the water from earth and
dispersing
it, so that te earth begins to putrefy. When it has thus putrefied and
been cleansed, the whole operation is done, with the aid of great God
most
high. Then you will attain that which you have sought, which is the
composition
of the seers, being a third part of the whole operation. And know that
you have accomplished nothing of your operation until you have
cleansed,
dried, and whitened the impure body, or earth, and so infused it with
spirit,
or fire, that the tincture descends into it and enters it with spirit,
or fire, that the tincture descends into it and enters it after it is
so
cleansed and improved, there being no further impurity or foulness in
it.
For the spirit quickly enters its proper body, but you will not be able
to join it with any other body, try as you will". </p>
  <p>"May the Creator come to my aid", said the king. "Now declare to
me
the second operation, and tell me whether it be the completion of the
first". </p>
  <p>Morienus answered: "It is indeed. When you have treated the body,
or
earth, in the way we have described, put it into a fourth part of the
ferment,
or milk. For the fermentation of gold is like that of bread. Then put
it
in the sun, or in dung, to be warmed, so that it is made one substance
and body, and dried. Then bless God and begin the washing. Take one
part
of the mortifying substance and cook it for three days, being careful
not
to lengthen or shorten the time, and do not let the fire, which should
be gentle, go out or burn to low. If you neglect this, your pot and
everything
in it will be ruined, much to your loss. Then wait seventeen days,
after
which return to your pot and open it. Change the liquid in it,
replacing
it with fresh, and do all this three times, until the fermentation of
this
gold is finished and this fourth of the brew is reduced by half. After
twenty days, take it out and dry it; in Arabic, it is called the
Elixir.
Then put the washed and prepared body upon your furnace, and moisten it
daily with a fourth part of the mortified matter which remains, taking
care that the flame of the fire does not touch the pot, which will be
destroyed
if it does. Finally, place the pot in a large furnace and start a fire
on top of it, keeping it up without diminution for two days and nights.
Then take the pot from the fire and praise the Creator for that which
he
has given you". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "I will do so, and may God be ever praised,
amen". </p>
  <p>Morienus continued: "Now I will explain further to you about this,
the
whole good of which consists in seeking the joining and concordance of
bodies which are shattered and then brought together again and which
are
so purified and treated as to appear directly by the power of fire.
Those
who seek after knowledge of these bodies must understand their pursuit
and capture, their dissolution and composition, how to build them up
and
boil them down, must know their natures and heats, and how to build
furnaces
for them and light the fires at the right places therein, and must know
the right number of days for each. For I have attained to the full
knowledge
of these things by the will of the great Creator most high. And the
very
root of this knowledge is to act with care and perception at the time
of
composition, avoiding all haste and error, and watching patiently day
and
night for fixation. But that which prepares this body is blood, or
virgin&#8217;s
milk, for it unites and joins all the various substances and properties
into one body, it being only necessary to apply to them a gentle heat
the
long continues at the same degree, neither increasing nor decreasing.
But
the substance eudica [glaze] should be used to agitate the bodies you
have
converted to earth so that they are not burned, for if they were
quickly
consumed, they would not long contain their spirits. Eudica consists
well
with all bodies, enlivening and preparing them without confusing them,
but converting certain of them into others and resisting the heat of
the
fire. If you wish to obtain eudica, look for it in vitreous minerals.
But
having found it, you must take care not to use it if its spirit has
escaped,
for you would spoil your operation. Therefore preserve it when you find
it. Now the foul earth readily receives the white sparks and prevents
the
destruction of the blood, or air, or virgin&#8217;s milk, during decoction.
But
such is the blood&#8217;s strength that it must be broken in order to promote
rather than impede, and this is done after whatever remaining still
dark
of the confused minerals has been whitened, thus accomplishing the full
fruit of this magistery, the truth of which you may well not at first
have
seen. That is in sum the secret of your operation, as I have condensed
it and set it forth for you. For surely, one part of this matter placed
upon a thousand parts of silver converts it all into fine, red gold,
God
willing. Therefore, seek nothing else beyond this matter, And may God
enrich
you, and all the adepts of this knowledge. But the root of its
possession
is only the gift of great God most high, who has awarded it to his
servants". </p>
  <p>Thereupon Morienus began to enumerate the various substances,
saying:
"O king, may God enrich you. Attend fully to me, that you may hear and
understand all that I am going to say to you". </p>
  <p>And King Khalid said: "O Morienus, tell me what you would have me
know". </p>
  <p>Morienus spoke: "The thing in which the entire accomplishment of
this
operation consists are the red vapor, the yellow vapor, the white
vapor,
the green lion, ocher, the impurities of the dead and of the stones,
blood,
eudica, and foul earth". </p>
  <p>King Khalid said: "Explain these terms to me". </p>
  <p>Morienus replied: "Before I explain them to you, I will both bring
before
you the things called by these names, that you may see them, as well as
work with them in your presence. These ten are of the same family, and
if you wish to seek them, distribute, and dissolve them, and stiffen,
join,
and confect them exactly as I am about to do before you, you have but
to
do likewise, for this is the root of this knowledge and operation,
which
many look for in all sorts of minerals, wet and dry. But do you as one
who sees, for the ignorant is not as the wise, nor the blind as the
sighted.
Do not depart from that which I have set forth for you and shown you,
for
you will go astray. There are great hindrances to knowledge. But one
who
has seen this operation performed is not as one who has sought it only
through books, for there are books which mislead those in quest of this
knowledge. And the greater part of those books are so obscure and
disorganized
that only those who wrote them can understand them. But he who is eager
for this knowledge and pursues it does well, for by means of it he will
gain access to strange things he had never known before". </p>
  <p>King Khalid: "The truth of what you say blossoms and shines in
your
explanation". </p>
  <p>Morienus continued: "In preparation of the body, or earth, for
purification,
you make it very hard and dry in nature, and then whiten it by purging
and washing, and invest it with the spirit, aid the quest for the white
or milky vapor, for the red or fiery or virgin&#8217;s milk, before the
elixir
is put onto it, for the elixir is absorbed only by a fine and pure body
having no foulness in such a way that it is beautifully tinted after
the
elixir has passed through it. This is the composition of the
authorities,
and is the first composition. Then begin in the Creator&#8217;s name and with
his vapor takes the whiteness from the white vapor. Now pour out these
things and set them about, taking an equal weight of each. Then they
are
mixed together. Pack the mixture in a vessel that will just hold the
full
charge. This is the best way to handle these things, for they contain
vapors
which escape unless sealed in a container. Now stop the mouth of this
vessel
well with the luting cement which the authorities use, adding a little
salt to it to make it stronger, that it may better withstand the heat
of
the fire. Let the furnace be heated with sheep dung or olive leaves and
the vessel with its contents put into it to sublime. The sublimation
should
be done after sunset and the vessel allowed to stand until the cool of
the evening. Then unstop the vessel and shatter it, examining that
which
is thus extracted, and if you find it well consolidated, like a stone,
grind it thoroughly. Sift it and put it into another vessel, the bottom
of which is rounded. Construct for it a philosophers&#8217; furnace and let a
philosophers&#8217; fire be started in it and kept going for a space of
twenty-four
days. After this time, you should withdraw the vessel from the furnace
and dry that which you find in it. Join one part of this of the
unpurified,
proceeding in this order one after the other until all are mixed
together,
from which the elixir then may be made. Then examine its interior, and
if you find the whiteness retained, well fixed and calcined, not driven
off by the heat of the fire even after much heating, you have
accomplished
both natures of this operation. But know that if you had given your
entire
kingdom and brought all your subjects together at once to project the
whiteness
into the purified matter, they would have been powerless to do so by
such
means. For the spirit readily enters its own body, but if you try to
put
it into some foreign body, you will waste your efforts. This truth is
perfectly
clear". </p>
  <p>"You have spoken truly, as I have witnessed", said King Khalid,
"and
may God receive the souls of his philosophers into his keeping". </p>
  <p>Here is another composition from the dialogues of Morienus the
Greek
with King Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu&#8217;awiyya. </p>
  <p>Morienus said: "Take the white vapor, or virgin&#8217;s milk, and the
green
lion, or fire, and red ocher, or fire, and the impurity of the dead, or
earth; dissolve them and cause them to ascend and unite, using for each
part of the green lion three parts of the impurity. Then put one part
of
the white vapor and two parts of the ocher in a green vessel to be
boiled,
stopping its mouth well with cement. Put this in the sun until it
dries,
and then put the elixir into it. Pour enough of the sanguine water over
it to cover it, and after three days, moisten it with the foul water.
But
take care neither to cut short nor extend the time, nor let the fire go
out, for it must be done just so. Likewise, see that the fire is not
too
hot, for your jar will be destroyed and everything in it also. Wait
seventeen
days, then go to your jar, open it and take out the water you will find
in it, replacing it with foul water, keeping the jar on the furnace.
After
twenty days, take it from the furnace and dry the elixir which it
contains.
Then take the well-washed body in which you find the whiteness pure and
fixed and put it in as small a jar as will contain it and will just fit
the furnace which you have made to take it. Heat it strongly in the
furnace,
but do not let the flame touch it, for that would destroy it. Then take
such a quantity of the elixir as to form eleven parts for every ten
parts
of the white body. Mix these, and for every ounce of this mixture, add
one-fourth of a dram of eudica. Then put the jar in a large furnace and
build a fire over it, keeping it going for two days without being
extinguished
at any hour of the day or night. When this is done, take out what you
find
in the jar and praise the great Creator most high for what He has given
you". </p>
  <p>Now here is an explanation of the various substances according to
Morienus,
who said that the philosophers referred to the impure body as lead. The
purified body is tin. The green lion is glass and almagra is latten,
although
it may have been called red earth earlier. And blood is orpiment, and
foul
earth is foul sulfur. Eudica is apart from all these and is called
glaze,
or the dregs and impurities of glass. The red vapor is red orpiment,
the
white vapor quicksilver and the yellow vapor sulfur. This is the nature
of the white vapor, the green lion, and the foul water. </p>
  <p>"Therefore", said Morienus, "keep these three to yourself. For
though
men seek this operation among all others, they will go utterly astray
until
sun, or fire, is compounded in a single body with earth and moon, which
will not occur until God wills. But you asked me what it is that men
think
to be the secret of this operation of the magistery and with what they
suppose the operation to be accomplished. Some thought it to be earth,
or a stone, or an egg, or blood, urine, or vinegar. And they ground and
assayed and extracted and dug around after all these things as their
fancy
took them, but erring the more, the more confident they were of finding
what they sought. Now you should know that earth and stone and all
those
things I have named, in which men trust, are false and come to no good
issue. The whole key to accomplishment of this operation is in the
fire,
with which the minerals are prepared and the bad spirits held back, and
with which the spirit and body are joined. Fire is the true test of
this
entire matter. And if the truth of anything pertaining to this
magistery
is not at once apparent, that will come to nothing, so when it does not
spring up nor mingle with the impure substance to form one body, you
will
looking vain for something of that which you seek to come forth. For
when
you do as I have told you, you will find what you seek, God willing.
Now
know this well, and understand and remember it, and know the
composition
of this matter and give it much study, which will reveal to you the
straight
path. Nor can anything more then be hidden from you. And even more
fundamental
is it that you know what the higher minerals are, so that the entire
work
be not ruined. But in answer to your question about the white vapor, or
virgin&#8217;s milk, you may know that it is a tincture and spirit of those
bodies
already dissolved and dead, from which the spirits have been withdrawn.
Then the spirits are again restored to them. But any body lacking
spirit
is dark. It is the white vapor that flows in the body and removes its
darkness,
or earthiness, and impurity, uniting the bodies into one and augmenting
their waters. For the black impurity is not persistent, and when its
blackness
is removed, the water will thus be strengthened and increased, so that
its beauty will appear and the tincture will be accomplished in it. You
should know this well and understand it, and know that when you have
thus
accomplished&nbsp; the tincture in it, you are on the right track
toward
that finest red gold, than which nothing better or purer is to be
found.
For this reason it is called Roman gold. Without the white vapor, there
could have been no pure gold nor any profit in it. Now the sum and full
proof of it is in placing one part of this alchemy on a thousand parts
of silver, which will be reddened and purified, just as we have said,
if
great God most high so wills, for there is no strength nor help except
by the will of great God most high". </p>
  <p>Here ends the book of Morienus, as it is called. Thanks be to God,
amen. </p>
