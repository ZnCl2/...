<p>TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND TRULY
<br>REGENERATED BRETHREN R. C.
<br>ELDERS OF ELECTION AND PEACEABLE APOSTLES OF THE CHURCH IN THIS
<br>STORM-DRIVEN AGE,
<br>SALUTATION FROM THE CENTRE OF PEACE</center>

<p>SEEING that the freedom of the High Altar is granted to the High Priest
alone, not without sacrilege may this overdaring offering seem to be thrust
upon you. Even devotion hath its limits. Those who approach unbidden may
be charged with presumption rather than loyalty, and such as those were
satirised in that old <i>gigantomachia</i> of the poets which sought to
take heaven by storm. Nor are fatuous and befogged sparklings wanting in
our own day who deem that they are stars and are thought equal to the sun.
May such arrogance and climax of ambition be far from Eugenius. ' It were
surely to pile Pelion upon Ossa. Most noble Brethren, I stand in the Court
of the Temple, nor is my offering placed on the altar but laid in modesty
at the threshold. Should my tribute be demanded, I wish to offer you such
gifts as ages and generations to come may liken to the Arpine scrolls.
Do not deem that I despair. Peradventure in days remote there shall rise
up those who will prize this my torchlet even as Tuscan suns. And indeed
I am an associate of Cicero, since our office aspires to the same everlasting
renown. I have roamed like the bees --- not those of Quintilian in a poisoned
field --- tasting celestial flowers, which draw their sweetness from the
hills of spices. If&nbsp; here there be aught of honey, I set before you
this honeycomb and beehive. But roses are commonly soiled on the breasts
of many : perchance also this handful is stained, for it is of my gathering.
Be it granted that the errors are of Eugenius : the rest is of truth. Yet
what profits this witness to the truth for you upright ones, who behold
in open day the threefold record of the Spirit, the Water and the Blood
? No voice of help is this, but needless rather. Wise is he who keeps silence
in the sight of heaven. Receive therefore, most illustrious Brethren, this
my mite, not as that which I would bring you but as all that I have. My
goodwill is in my willing service. My poverty prays further&nbsp; regard
not the gift itself but the obedience of

<p>Your Suppliant,</center>

<p><b><i>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER</i></b></center>

<p>I LOOK on this life as the progress of an essence royal : the soul but
quits her court to see the country. Heaven hath in it a scene of earth,
and had she been contented with ideas she had not travelled beyond the
map. But excellent patterns commend their mimes : Nature that was so fair
in the type could not be a slut in the anaglyph. This makes her ramble
hither, to examine the medal by the flask ; but whiles she scans their
symmetry she forms&nbsp; it. Thus her descent speaks her original. God
in love with His own beauty frames a glass, to view it by reflection. But
the frailty of the matter excluding eternity, the composure was subject
to dissolution. Ignorance gave this release the name of death, but properly
it is the soul's birth and a charter that makes for her liberty. She hath
several ways to break up house, but her best is without a disease. This
is her mystical walk, an exit only to return. When she takes air at this
door, it is without prejudice to her tenement.&nbsp; The magicians tell
me that the soul passes out of one mode and enters another: Some have examined
this and state it an expense of influences, as if the soul exercised her
royalty at the eye or had some blind jurisdiction at the pores. But this
is to measure magical positions by the slight, superficial strictures of
the ccfmmon philosophy. It is an age of intellectual slaveries : if they
meet anything extraordinary, they prune it commonly with distinctions or
daub it with false glosses, till it looks like the traditions of Aristotle.
His followers are so confident of his principles they seek not to understand
what others speak but to make others speak what they understand. It is
in Nature as it is in religion : we are still hammering of old elements
but seek not the America that lies beyond them. The apostle tells us of
leaving the first principles of the Doctrine of Christ and going on to
perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works
; and of faith towards God ; of the doctrine of Baptism and laying on of
hands ; of resurrection and the eternal judgment. Then he speaks of illumination,
of tasting of the heavenly gift, of being partakers of the Holy Ghost,
of tasting of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come.
Now, if I should question any sect --- for there is no communion in Christendom
--- whither these later intimations drive, they can but return me to the
first rudiments or produce some empty pretence of spirit. Our natural philosophers
are much of a cast with those that step into the prerogative of prophets
and antedate events in configurations and motions. This is a consequence
of as much reason as if I saw the Swede exercising and would find his designs
in his postures. Friar Bacon walked in Oxford between two steeples, but
he that would have discovered his thoughts by his steps had been more his
fool than his fellow.
<p>The Peripatetics when they define the soul, or some inferior principle,
describe it only by outward circumstances, which every child can do ; but
they state nothing essentially. Thus they dwell altogether in the face
; their endeavours are mere titillations ; and their acquaintance with
Nature is not at the heart. Notwithstanding, I acknowledge the schoolmen
ingenious : they conceive their principles irregular and prescribe rules
for method, though they want matter. Their philosophy is like a church
that is all discipline and no doctrine ; for bate me their prolegomena,
their form of arguing, their reciting of different opinions, with several
other digressions, and the substance of these Tostati will scarce amount
to a Mercury. Besides their Aristotle is a poet in text ; his principles
are but fancies, and they stand more on our concessions than his bottom.
Hence it 'is that his followers --- notwithstanding the assistance of so
many ages---&nbsp; can fetch nothing out of him but notions ; and these
indeed they use, as he saith Lycophron did his epithets, not as spices
but as food. Their compositions are a mere tympany of terms. It is better
than a fight in Quixote to observe what duels and digladiations they have
about him. One will make him speak sense, another nonsense and a third
both. Aquinas palps him gently, Scotus makes him wince, and he is taught
like an ape to shew several tricks. If we look on his adversaries, the
least among them hath foiled him ; but Telesius knocked him on the head
and Gampanella hath quite discomposed him. But as that bold haunter of
the circus had his skull so steeled with use, it shivered all the tiles
were thrown at it, so this Aristotle thrives by scuffles and the world
cries him up when truth cries him down.
<p>The Peripatetics look on God as they do on carpenters, who build with
stone and timber, without any infusion of life. But the world --- which
is God's building --- is full of spirit, quick and living. This spirit
is the cause of multiplication, of several perpetual productions of minerals,
vegetables and creatures engendered by putrefaction --- all which are manifest,
infallible arguments of life. Besides, the texture of the universe clearly
discovers its animation. The earth --- which is the visible, natural basis
of --- it represents the gross, carnal parts. The element of water answers
to the blood, for in it the pulse of the Great World beats : this most
men call the flux and reflux, but they know not the true cause of it. The
air is the outward refreshing spirit, where this vast creature breathes
--- though invisibly, yet not altogether insensibly. The interstellar skies
are his vital, ethereal waters and the stars his animal, sensual fire.
Thou wilt tell me perhaps : This is new philosophy, and that of Aristotle
is old. It is indeed, but in the same sense as religion is at Rome. It
is not the primitive truth of the creation, not the ancient, real theosophy
of the Hebrews and Egyptians, but a certain preternatural upstart, a vomit
of Aristotle, which his followers --- with so much diligence --- lick up
and swallow... I present thee not here with any clamorous opposition of
their patron but a positive express of principles as I find them in Nature.
I may say of them as Moses said of the FIAT : "These are the generations
of the heavens and of the earth, in the day that the Lord God made the
earth and the heavens." They are things beyond reasoning --- sensible,
practical truths, not mere vagaries and rambles of the brain. I would not
have thee look on my endeavours as a design of captivity. I intend not
the conquest but the exercise of thy reason, not that, thou shouldst swear
allegiance to my dictates but compare my conclusions with Nature and examine
their correspondence. Be pleased to consider that obstinacy enslaves the
soul and clips the wings which God gave her for flight and discovery. If
thou wilt not quit thy Aristotle, let not any prejudice hinder thy further
search. Great is their number who perhaps had attained to perfection, had
they not already thought themselves perfect. This is my advice but how
welcome to thee I know not. If thou wilt kick and fling, I shall say with
the Cardinal : " My ass also kicks up his heels."&nbsp; It is an age wherein
truth is near a miscarriage, and it is enough for me that I have appeared
thus far for it in a day of necessity.

<br>
<br>
<p>WHEN I found out this truth, that man in his original was a branch planted
in God and that there was a continual influx from the stock to the scion,
I was much troubled at his corruptions and wondered his fruits were not
correspondent to his root. But when I was told he had tasted of another
tree my admiration was quickly off, it being my chief care to reduce him
to his first simplicity and separate his mixtures of good and evil. But
his Fall had so bruised him in his best part that his soul had no knowledge
left to study him a cure. His punishment presently followed his trespass
: " all things were hidden and oblivion, the mother of ignorance, entered
in." This Lethe remained not in his body but, passing together with his
nature, made his posterity her channel. Imperfection's an easy inheritance,
but virtue seldom finds any heirs. Man had at the first --- and so have
all souls before their entrance into the body --- an explicit methodical
knowledge; but they are no sooner vested but that liberty is lost and nothing
remains but a vast, confused notion of the creature. Thus had I only left
a capacity without power and a will to do that which was far enough above
me. In this perplexity I studied several arts and rambled over all those
inventions which the folly of man called sciences. But these endeavours
suiting not to my purpose, I quitted this book business and thought it
a better course to study Nature .than opinion. Hereupon I considered with
myself that man was not the primitive, immediate work of God, but the world
out of which he was made. And to regulate my studies in point of method,
I judged it convenient to examine his principles first and not him. But
the world in general being too large for inquisition, I resolved to take
part for the whole and to give a guess at the frame by proportion. To perfect
this my essay I took to task the fruits of one spring. Here I observed
a great many vegetables, fresh and beauteous in their time ; but when I
looked back on their original they were no such things as vegetables. This
observation I applied to the world and gained by it this inference that
the world in the beginning was no such thing as it is, but some other seed
or matter out of which that fabric which I now behold did arise. But resting
not here I drove my conclusion further. I conceived those seeds whereof
vegetables did spring must be something else at first than seeds, as having
some pre-existent matter whereof they were made, but what that matter should
be I could not guess. Here was I forced to leave off speculation and come
up to experience. Whiles I sought the world I went beyond it, and I was
now in quest of a substance which --- without art --- I could not see.
Nature wraps this most strangely in her very bosom, neither doth she expose
it to anything but her own vital, celestial breath. But in respect that
Qod Almighty is the only proper, immediate Agent which actuates this Matter
--- as well in the work of generation as formerly in His creation --- it
will not be amiss to speak something of Him, that we may know the Cause
by His creatures and the creatures by their Cause.
<p>My God, my life, Whose essence man
<br>Is no way fit to know or scan,
<br>But should approach Thy court a guest
<br>In thoughts more low than his request :
<br>When I consider how I stray,
<br>Methinks, 'tis pride in me to pray.
<br>How dare I speak to Heaven, nor fear
<br>In all my sins to court Thy ear ?
<br>But as I look on moles that lurk
<br>In blind entrenchments and there work
<br>Their own dark prisons to repair,
<br>Heaving the earth to take in air ---
<br>So view my fetter'd soul, that must
<br>Struggle with this her load of dust ;
<br>Meet her address and add one ray
<br>To this mew'd parcel of Thy day.
<br>She would --- though here imprisoned --- see,
<br>Through all her dirt, Thy throne and Thee.
<br>Lord, guide her out of this sad night
<br>And say once more : Let there be light.
<p>It is God's own positive truth. " In the beginning " --- that is, in
that dead silence, in that horrible and empty darkness when as yet nothing
was fashioned then saith the Lord --- " did I consider these things, and
they all were made through Me alone, and through none other : by Me also
they shall be ended, and by none other." That meditation foreruns every
solemn work is a thing so well known to man that he needs no further demonstration
of it than his own practice. That there is also in God something analogical
to it, from whence man derived this customary notion of his, as it is most
agreeable to reason, so withal is it very suitable to Providence. " The
gods " --- saith Iamblichus --- "did conceive the whole work within themselves
before it was brought forth by them.' And the Spirit here to Esdras : "
Then did I consider these things." He considered them first and made them
afterwards. God in His eternal idea foresaw that whereof as yet there was
no material copy. The goodness and beauty of the one moved Him to .create
the other, and truly the image of this prototype, being embosomed in the
second, made Him so much in love with His creature that when sin had defaced
it, He restored it by the suffering of that pattern by which at first it
was made. Dionysius the Areopagite, who lived in the primitive times, and
received the Mysteries of Divinity immediately from the Apostles, styles
God the Father sometimes "the arcanum of Divinity," sometimes "that hidden,
supersubstantial Being " ; and elsewhere he compares Him to a root whose
flowers are the Second and Third Persons. This is true, for God the Father
is the basis or supernatural foundation of His creatures ; God the Son
is the pattern, in Whose express image they were made ; and God the Holy
Ghost is the Creator Spirit, or the Agent Who framed the creature in a
just symmetry to his Type. This consideration or Type God hath since used
in the performance of inferior works. Thus in the institution of His temple
He commands Moses to the mount, where the Divine Spirit shews him the idea
of the future fabric. " And let them make Me a sanctuary ; that I may dwell
among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall
ye make it.'" Thus the Divine Mind doth instruct us " by setting forth
ideas as by a kind of self-extension beyond Itself," and sometimes more
particularly in dreams. To Nebuchadnezzar He presents a tree strong and
high, reaching to the heavens " and the sight thereof to the ends of all
the earth." To Pharaoh he shews seven ears of corn. To Joseph He appears
in sheaves and then resembles the sun, moon and stars. To conclude, He
may express Himself by what He will, for in Him are innumerable, eternal
prototypes, and He is the true fountain and treasure of forms.
<p>But that we may come at last to the scope proposed : God fhe Father
is the Metaphysical, Supercelestial Sun ; the Second Person is the Light
; and the Third is Fiery Love, or a Divine Heat proceeding from both. Now,
without the presence of this Heat there is no reception of the Light and
by consequence no influx from the Father of Lights. For this Love is the
medium which unites the Lover to that which is beloved, and probably 'tis
the Platonic's " Chief Daimon, Who doth unite us with the Prefects of Spirits."
I could speak much more of the offices of this Loving Spirit, but these
are "grand mysteries of God and Nature " and require not our discussion
so much as our reverence. Here also I might speak of that Supernatural
Generation whereof Trismegistus : " The Monad begetteth the Monad and doth
reflect upon itself its own fervour." ' But I leave this to the Almighty
God as 'His own essential, central mystery. It is my only intention in
this place to handle exterior actions, or the process of the Trinity from
the centre to the circumference ; and that I may the better do it you are
to understand that God --- before His work of creation --- was wrapped
up and contracted in Himself. In this state the Egyptians style Him the
Solitary Monad and the Kabalists Dark Aleph ; but when the decreed instant
of creation came, then appeared Bright Aleph, and the first emanation was
that of the Holy Ghost into the bosom of the matter. Thus we read that
" darkness was upon the face of the deep " and " the Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters." ' Here you are to observe that, notwithstanding
this process of the Third Person, yet was there no light, but darkness
on the face of the deep, illumination properly being the office of the
Second. Wherefore God also, when the matter was prepared by Love for Light,
gives out His <i>Fiat Lux</i>, which was no creation --- as most think
--- but an emanation of the Word, in Whom was life, and that life is the
light of men. This is that light whereof St John speaks, that it " shineth
in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not."&nbsp; But lest I seem
to be singular in this point I will give you more evidence. Pymander informing
Trismegistus in the work of creation tells him the self-same thing. " I
am that Light, the Mind, thy God, more ancient than the watery nature which
shone forth out of the shadow." And Georgius Venetus in his book De Harmonia
Mundi : " Whatsoever liveth doth subsist by virtue of its inward heat.
Thence that substance of heat, indifferently distributed through the world,
is held to contain within itself a vital strength. Yea, Zoroaster witnesseth
that all things were made out of fire when he saith : all things were produced
from a single fire, from that fire, namely, which God, the dweller in the
fiery essence --- as Plato hath it --- did ordain to appear in the substance
of heaven and earth, at that time created rude and formless, that it might
assume life and form. Hereupon the Fabricator did straightway give forth
the <i>Sit Lux</i>, for which a mendacious rendering hath substituted <i>Fiat
Lux</i>. For the Light is in no wise made but is communicated and admitted
to things heretofore obscure, that they may be brightened and glorified
in their forms."
<p>But to proceed : No sooner had the Divine Light pierced the bosom of
the matter but the idea or pattern of the whole material world appeared
in those primitive waters, like an image' in a glass. By this pattern it
was that the Holy Ghost framed and modelled the universal structure. This
mystery or appearance of the idea is excellently manifested in the magical
analysis of bodies. For he that knows how to imitate the proto-chemistry
of the Spirit, by separation of the principles wherein the life is imprisoned,
may see the impress of it experimentally in the outward natural vestments.
But lest you should think this my invention and no practical truth I will
give you another man's testimony. " I ask " --- saith one --- " what great
philosophers would say if they saw the plant born as in a moment in the
glass vial, with its colours as in life, if they saw it again die, again
reborn, and this daily, whensoever they please ? But the power to deceive
human senses is included, I believe, in the magical art of demons." They
are the words of Dr Marci in his <i>Defensio Idearum Operatricium</i>?
But you are to be admonished there is a twofold idea --- Divine and natural.
The natural is a fiery, invisible, created spirit and properly a mere enclosure
or vestment of the true One.&nbsp; Hence the Platonists called it "the
nimbus of descending Divinity." Zoroaster and some other philosophers think
it is the Soul of the World ; but --- by their leave --- they are mistaken.
There is a wide difference betwixt Soul and Spirit. But the idea I speak
of here is the true, primitive, exemplar one and a pure influence of the
Almighty. This idea, before the coagulation of the seminal principles to
a gross outward fabric which is the end of generation ---&nbsp; impresseth
in the vital, ethereal principles a model or pattern after which the body
is to. be framed, and this is the first inward production or draft of the
creature. This is it which the Divine Spirit intimates to us in that Scripture
where He saith that God created "every plant of the field before it was
in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew." : But, notwithstanding
this presence of the idea in the Matter, yet the creation was not performed
" by the projection of something from the essence of the idea' : for it
is God that comprehends His creature and not the creature God.
<p>Thus far have I handled this primitive supernatural part of the creation.
I must confess it is but short in respect of that which may be spoken ;
but I am confident it is more than formerly hath been discovered, some
authors having not searched so deeply into the centre of Nature and others
not willing to publish such spiritual mysteries. I am now come to the gross
work or mechanics of the Spirit, namely, the separation of several substances
from the same mass. But in the first place I shall examine that limbus
or huddle of matter wherein all things were so strangely contained. It
is the opinion of some men, and those learned, that this sluggish, empty
rudiment of the creature was no created thing. I must confess the point
is obscure as the thing itself and to state it with sobriety --- except
a man were illuminated with the same light that this chaos was at first
--- is altogether impossible. For how can we judge of a nature different
from our own, whose species also was so remote from anything now existent
that it is impossible for fancy to apprehend, much more for reason to define
it ? If it be created, I conceive it the effect of the Divine Imagination,
acting beyond itself in contemplation of that which was to come and producing
this passive darkness for a subject to work upon in the circumference.
Trismegistus, having first expressed his vision of light, describes the
matter in its primitive state thus : " And in a short time after " ---
he saith --- " the darkness was thrust downwards, partly confused and dejected,
and tortuously circumscribed, so that I appeared to behold it transformed
into a certain humid substance and more agitated than words could express,
vomiting forth smoke as from fire and emitting an inexpressible and lugubrious
sound." Certainly these tenebre he speaks of, or fuliginous spawn of Nature,
were the first created Matter, for that water we read of in Genesis was
a product or secondary substance. Here also he seems to agree further with
the Mosaical tradition. For this " smoke " which ascended after the transmutation
can be nothing else but that darkness which was upon the face of the deep.
<p>But, to express, the particular mode or way of the creation, you are
to understand that in the Matter there was a horrible, confused qualm or
stupefying spirit of moisture, cold and darkness. In the opposite principle
of light there was heat and the effect of it siccity. For these two are
no elemental qualities, as the Galenists and my Peripatetics suppose. But
they are --- if I may say so --- the hands of the Divine Spirit, by which
He did work upon the Matter, applying every agent to his proper patients.
These two are active and masculine ; those of moisture and cold are passive
and feminine. Now, as soon as the Holy Ghost and the Word --- for it was
not the one nor the other but both, " the Formative Mind conjoined with
the Word --- as Trismegistus hath it: I omit that speech, " Let us make
man," which effectually proves their union in the work --- had applied
themselves to the Matter, there was extracted from the bosom of it a thin,
spiritual, celestial substance, which, receiving a tincture of heat and
light, proceeding from the Divine Treasuries, became a pure, sincere, innoxious
fire. Of this the bodies of angels consist, as also the empyreal heaven,
where intellectual essences have their residence. This was " the primeval
marriage of God and Nature," the first and best of compositions. This extract
--- being thus settled above and separated from the mass retained in it
a vast portion of light and made the first day without a sun. But the splendour
of the Word expelling the darkness downwards it became more settled and
compact towards the centre and made a horrible, thick night. Thus God ---
as the Hebrew hath it --- was between the light and the darkness, for the
Spirit remained still on the face of the inferior portion, to extract more
from it. In the second separation was educed " the nimble atmosphere "
--- as Trismegistus calls it --- a spirit not so refined as the former
but vital and in the next degree to it. This was extracted in such abundance
that it filled all the space from the mass to the e/npyreal heaven, under
which it was condensed to a water, but of a different constitution from
the elemental ; and this is the body of the interstellar sky. But my Peripatetics,
following the principles of Aristotle and Ptolemy, have imagined so many
wheels there, with their final diminutive epicycles, that they have turned
that regular fabric to a rumbling, confused labyrinth.
<p>The inferior portion of this second extract from the moon to the earth
remained air still, partly to divide the inferior and superior waters,
but chiefly for the respiration and nourishment of the creatures. This
is that which is properly called the firmament, as it is plain out of Esdras
: " Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament," for it
is "the bond of all Nature," and in the outward geometrical composure it
answers to "the middle substance," for it is spread through all things,
hinders vacuity and keeps all the parts of Nature in a firm, invincible
union. This is " the sieve of Nature," as one wittily calls it, a thing
appointed for most secret and mysterious offices ; but we shall speak further
of it when we come to handle the elements particularly. Nothing now remained
but the two inferior principles --- as we commonly call them --- earth
and water. The earth was an impure, sulphureous subsidence or <i>caput
mortuum</i> of the creation. The water also was phlegmatic, crude and <i>raco</i>,
not so vital as the former extractions. But the Divine Spirit, to make
His work perfect, moving also upon these, imparted to them life and heat,
and made them fit for future productions. The earth was so overcast and
mantled with the water that no part thereof was to be seen. But that it
might be the more immediately exposed to the celestial influences which
are the cause of vegetation the Spirit orders a retreat of the waters,
and breaks up for them His " decreed plan " and sets them " bars and doors."
<p>The light as yet was not confined, but --- retaining its vast flux and
primitive liberty --- equally possessed the whole creature. On the fourth
day it was collected to a sun and taught to know his fountain. The darkness,
whence proceed the corruptions and consequently the death of the creature,
was imprisoned in the centre, but breaks out still when the day gives it
leave, and like a baffled giant thrusts his head out of doors in the absence
of his adversary. Thus Nature is a Lady whose face is beauteous but not
without a black-bag. Howsoever, when it shall please God more perfectly
to refine His creatures this tincture shall be expelled quite beyond them,
and then it will be an outward darkness --- from which, Good Lord, deliver
us.
<p>Thus have I given you a cursory and short express of the creation in
general. I shall now descend to a more particular examination of Nature
and especially her inferior, elemental parts, through which man passeth
daily and from which he cannot be separated. I was about to desist in this
place, to prevent all future acclamations ; for when a Peripatetic finds
here but three --- nay, but two genuine elements, earth and water --- for
the air is something more --- will he not cry out I have committed sacrilege
against Nature and stole the fire from her altar ? This is noise indeed,
but till they take coach in a cloud and discover that idol they prefer
next to the moon, I am resolved to continue in my heresy. I am not only
of opinion but I am sure there is no such principle in Nature. The fire
which she useth is " the physical and incorporeal horizon, the bond of
either world and the sigil of the Holy Spirit." It is no chimera, commentitious
quirck, like that of the schoolmen. I shall therefore request my friends
the Peripatetics to return their fourth element to Aristotle, that he may
present it to Alexander the Great as the first part of a new world, for
there is no such thing in the old.
<p>To proceed then : the earth --- as you were told before --- being the
subsidence or remains of that primitive mass which God formed out of darkness,
must needs be a feculent, impure body ; for the extractions which the Divine
Spirit made were pure, oleous, ethereal substances, but the crude, phlegmatic,
indigested humours settled like lees towards the centre. The earth is spongy,
porous and magnetical, of composition loose, the better to take in the
several influences of heat, rains and dews for the nurture and conservation
of her products. In her is the principal residence of that matrix which
attracts and receives the sperm from the masculine part of the world. She
is Nature's Etna : here Vulcan doth exercise himself, not that limping
poetical one which halted after his fall, but a pure, celestial, plastic
fire. We have astronomy here under pur feet ; the stars are resident with
us and abundance of jewels and pentauras. She is the nurse and receptacle
of all things, for the superior natures engulf themselves into her ; what
she receives this age she discovers to the next and like a faithful treasurer
conceals no part of her account. Her proper, congenial quality is cold.
<p>I am now to speak of the water. This is the first element we read of
in Scripture, the most ancient of principles and the mother of all things
amongst visibles. Without the mediation of this the earth can receive no
blessing at all, for moisture is the proper cause of mixture and fusion.
The water hath several complexions, according to the several parts of the
creature. Here below, and in the circumference of all things, it is volatile,
crude and raco. For this very cause Nature makes it no part of her provision
but she rectifies it first, exhaling it up with her heat and then condensing
it to rains and dews, in which state she makes use of it for nourishment.
Somewhere it is interior, vital and celestial, exposed to the Breath of
the First Agent and stirred with spiritual, eternal winds. In this condition
it is Nature's wanton --- <i>foemina satacissima</i>, as one calls it.
This is that Psyche of Apuleius, and the fire of Nature is her Cupid. He
that hath seen them both in the same bed will confess that love rules all.
But to speak something of our common elemental water : it is not altogether
contemptible. There are hidden treasures in it, but so enchanted we cannot
see them --- for all the chest is so transparent. " The congealed spirit
of invisible water is better than all the earth," saith the noble and learned
Sendivogius. I do not advise the reader to take this phlegm to task, as
if he could extract a Venus from the sea, but I wish him to study water,
that he may know the fire.
<p>I have now handled the two elements and more I cannot find. I know the
Peripatetics pretend to four and --- with the help of their master's quintessence
--- to a fifth principle. I shall at leisure diminish their stock, but
the thing to be now spoken of is air. This is no element but a certain
miraculous hermaphrodite, the cement of two worlds and a medley of extremes.
It is Nature's commonplace, her index, where you may find all that ever
she did or intends to do. This is the world's panegyric ; the excursions
of both globes meet here ; and I may call it the rendezvous. In this are
innumerable magical forms of men and beasts, fish and fowl, trees, herbs
and all creeping things. This is " the sea of invisible things " ; for
all the conceptions " in the bosom of the higher Nature " wrap themselves
in this tiffany before they embark in the shell. It retains the species
of all things whatsoever and is the immediate receptacle of spirits after
dissolution, whence they pass to a superior limbus. I should amaze the
reader if I did relate the several offices of this body, but it- is the
magician's back door and none but friends come in at it. I shall speak
nothing more, only this I would have you know : the air is " the body of
life of our sensitive spirit," our animal oil, the fuel of the vital, sensual
fire, without which we cannot subsist a minute.
<p>I am now come to the fourth and last substance, the highest <i>in scala
Nature</i>. There is no fifth principle --- no quintessence as Aristotle
dreamed --- but God Almighty. This fourth essence is a moist, silent fire.
This fire passeth through all things in the world and it is Nature's chariot.
In this she rides ; when she moves this moves ; and when she stands this
stands, like the wheels in Ezekiel, whose motion depended on that of the
spirit. This is the mask and screen of the Almighty : wheresoever He is,
this train of fire attends Him. Thus He appears to Moses in the bush, but
it was in fire. The prophet sees Him break out at the North, but like a
fire catching itself. At Horeb He is attended with a mighty strong wind
; but after this comes the fire, and with it a still small voice. Esdras
also defines Him a God Whose service is conversant in wind and fire. This
fire is the vestment of the Divine Majesty, His back-parts which He shewed
to Moses ; but His naked, royal essence none can see and live. The glory
of His presence would swallow up the natural man and make him altogether
spiritual. Thus Moses --- his face after conference with Him --- shines,
and from this small tincture we may guess at our future estate in the regeneration.
But I have touched the veil and must return to the outer court of the Sanctuary.
<p>I have now in some measure performed that which at first I promised
--- an exposition of the world and the parts thereof. But in respect of
my affection to truth and the dominion I wish her, I shall be somewhat
more particular in the examination of Nature and proceed to a further discovery
of her riches. I advise the reader to be diligent and curious in this subsequent
part of the discourse, that having once attained to the fundamentals of
science he may the better understand her superstructures. Know then that
every element is threefold, this triplicity being the express image of
their Author and a seal He hath laid upon His creature. There is nothing
on earth --- though never so simple, so vile and abject in the sight of
man --- but it bears witness of God, even to that abstruse mystery, His
Unity and Trinity. Every compound whatsoever is three in one and one in
three. The basest reptile even, in his outward symmetry, testifies of his
Author, his several proportions answering to their eternal, superior Prototype.
Now, man hath the use of all these creatures, God having furnished, him
with a living library wherein to employ himself. But he, neglecting the
works of his Creator, prosecutes the inventions of the creature, laps up
the vomit of Aristotle and other illiterate ethnics --- men as concerning
the faith reprobate and in the law of Nature altogether unskilful, scribbling,
blasphemous atheists ; " whose souls " --- as Agrippa hath it --- " are
torn and distracted by hearing and behold the infernal gods." He is much
troubled at those Mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation ; one denies,
another grants them ; but if they did once 'see the light of Nature they
might find those Mysteries by reason which are now above their faith.
<p>When I speak of a natural triplicity, I speak not of kitchen-stuff ---
those three pot-principles, water, oil and earth. But I speak of celestial,
hidden natures known only to absolute magicians, whose eyes are in the
centre, not in the circumference ; and in this sense every element is threefold.
For example, there is a threefold earth : first, there is elementary earth,
then there is celestial earth, and lastly there is spiritual earth. The
influences of the spiritual earth, by mediation of the celestial, are!
united to the terrestrial and are the true cause of life and vegetation.
These three are the fundamentals of Art and Nature. The first is a visible,
tangible substance ; pure, fixed and incorruptible ; of quality cold ---
but by application of a superior agent --- dry ; and by consequence a 'fit
receptacle of moisture. This is the Created <i>Aleph</i> the true Adamic
Earth --- the basis of every building in heaven and earth. It answers to
God the Father, being the natural foundation of the creature, as He is
the supernatural. Without this nothing can be perfected in magic. The second
principle is the infallible magnet, the Mystery of Union. By this all things
may be attracted, whether physical or metaphysical --- be the distance
never so great. This is Jacob's Ladder : without this there is no ascent
or descent, either influential or personal. The absence of this I conceive
to be that gulf between Abraham and Dives. This answers to God the Son,
for it is that which mediates between extremes, and makes inferiors and
superiors communicate. But there is not one in ten thousand knows either
the substance or the use of this nature. The third principle is properly
no principle : it is not "from which" but " by which all things are." This
can do all in all, and the faculties thereof are not to be expressed. It
answers to the Holy Ghost, for amongst naturals it is the only agent and
artificer.
<p>Now, he that knows these three perfectly, with their several gradations
or annexed links, which differ not in substance but complexion ; he that
can reduce their impurities to one sincere consistence and their multiplicities
to a spiritual, essential simplicity ; he is an absolute, complete magician
and in full possibility to all strange, miraculous performances. In the
second place, you are to learn that every element is twofold. This duplicity
or confusion is that <i>Binarius</i> whereof Agrippa <i>In Scalis Numerorum</i>,
as also both himself and Trithemius in their Epistles.&nbsp; Other authors
who dealt in this science are pragmatical scribblers and understood not
this Secret or the Shades. This is it in which the creature prevaricates
and falls from his first harmonical unity. You must therefore subtract
the duad and then the magician's triad may be reduced " by the tetrad into
the very simple monad," and by consequence " into a metaphysical union
with the Supreme Monad."
<p>The sun and moon are two magical principles --- the one active, the
other passive ; this masculine, that feminine. As they move, so move the
wheels of corruption and generation. They mutually dissolve and compound
; but properly the moon is " the instrument of the transmutation of inferior
matter." These two luminaries are multiplied and fructify in everyone particular
generation. There is not a compound in all Nature but hath in it a little
sun and a little moon. The little sun is son of the Celestial Sun ; the
little moon is daughter of the Celestial Moon. What offices soever the
two great luminaries .perform for the conservation of the great world in
general, these two little luminaries perform the like for the conservation
of their small cask or microcosm in particular. They are " miniatures of
the greater animal " --- heaven and earth in a lesser character. God ---
like a wise Architect --- sits in the centre of all, repairs the ruins
of His building, composeth all disorders and continues His Creature in
his first primitive harmony. The invisible, central moon is " that well-watered
and many fountained moist principle " at whose top sit Jove and Juno in
a throne of gold. Juno is an incombustible, eternal oil and therefore a
fit receptacle of fire. This fire is her Jove, the little sun we spoke
of formerly. These are the true principles of the Stone ; these are the
philosopher's Sun and Moon not gold and silver, as some mountebanks and
carbonados would have it. But in respect I have proceeded thus far, I will
give you a receipt of the Medicine. Rx, Ten parts of celestial slime. Separate
the male from the female, and then each from its earth, naturally, however,
and without violence. Conjoin after separation in due, harmonic, vital
proportion.. The soul, descending straightway from the pyroplastic sphere,
shall restore its dead and deserted body by a wonderful embrace. The conjoined
substances shall be warmed by a natural fire in a perfect marriage of spirit
and body. Proceed according to the Vulcano-Magical Artifice till they are
exalted into the Fifth Metaphysical Rota. This is that Medicine about which
so many have scribbled but so few have known.
<p>It is a strange thing to consider that there are in Nature incorruptible,
immortal principles. Our ordinary kitchen fire --- which in some measure
is an enemy to all compositions --- notwithstanding doth not so much destroy
as purify some parts. This is clear out of the ashes of vegetables ; for
although their weaker, exterior elements expire by violence of the fire
yet their earth cannot be destroyed but vitrified. The fusion and transparency
of this substance is occasioned by the radical moisture or seminal water
of the compound. This water resists the fury of the fire and cannot possibly
be vanquished. " The rose lieth hidden through the winter in this water"
--- saith the learned Severinus. These two principles are never separated,
for Nature proceeds not so far in her dissolutions. When death hath done
her worst there is an union between these two and out of them shall God
raise us at the last day and restore us to a spiritual constitution. Besides
.there remains in them that primitive, universal tincture of the fire.
This is still busy after death, brings Nature again into play, produceth
worms and other inferior generations. I do not conceive there shall be
a resurrection of every species, but rather their terrestrial parts, together
with the element of water for there shall be " no more sea " shall be united
in one mixture with the earth and fixed to a pure, diaphanous substance.
This is St John's crystal gold, a fundamental of the New Jerusalem, so
called not in respect of colour but constitution. Their spirits, I suppose,
shall be reduced to their first limbus --- a sphere of pure ethereal fire,
like rich eternal tapestry spread under the Throne of God.
<p>Thus, Reader, have I made a plenary but short inquisition into the mysteries
of Nature. It is more than hitherto hath been discovered and therefore
I expect the more opposition. I know my reward is calumny ; but he that
hath already condemned the vanity of opinion is not like to respect that
of censure. I shall now put the creatures to their just use and from this
shallow contemplation ascend to mine and their Author.
<p>Lord God, this was a stone
<br>As hard as any one
<br>Thy laws in Nature framed.
<br>'Tis now a springing well
<br>And many drops can tell,
<br>Since it by Art was framed.
<p>My God, my heart is so ;
<br>'Tis all of flint and no
<br>Extract of tears will yield.
<br>Dissolve it with Thy fire,
<br>That something may aspire
<br>And grow up in my field.
<p>Bare tears I'll not entreat,
<br>But let Thy Spirit's seat
<br>Upon those waters be ;
<br>Then I --- new form'd with light---
<br>Shall move without all night
<br>Or eccentricity.
<p>It is requisite now --- if we follow that method which God Himself is
Author of --- to examine the nature and composition of man, having already
described those elements or principles whereof he was made and consists.
Man --- if we look on his material parts --- was taken out of the great
world, as woman was taken out of man. I shall therefore --- to avoid repetition
--- refer the reader to the former part of this discourse, where --- if
things be rightly understood --- he cannot be ignorant in his material
frame and composure. We read in Genesis that God made him out of the earth.
This is a great mystery, for it was not the common pot-clay but another
and that of a far better nature.&nbsp; He that knows this knows the subject
of the Philosophical Medicine, and by consequence what destroys or preserves
the temperament of man. In this are principles homogeneal with his life,
such as can restore his decays and reduce his disorders to a harmony. They
that are ignorant in this point are not competent judges of life and death,
but quacks and piss-pot doctors. The learned Arias Montanus calls this
Matter " the unique particle of the multiplex earth." If these words be
well examined you may possibly find it out ; and so much for his body.
His soul is an essence not to be found in the texture of the great world
and therefore merely divine and supernatural. Montanus calls it " Wind
of the Divine Spirit and Breath of Divine Life." He seems also to make
the creation of man a little incarnation, as if God in this work had multiplied
Himself. Adam --- saith he --- received his soul " by an admirable and
singular inspiration and fructification of God, if it be lawful so to call
it."' St Luke also tells us the same thing, for he makes Adam the son of
God, not in respect of. the exterior act of creation but by way of descent.
And this St Paul confirms in the words of Aratus --- "for we are also His
generation." The soul of man consists chiefly of two portions, <i>Ruach</i>
and <i>Nephesh</i> --- inferior and superior. The superior is masculine
and eternal, the inferior feminine and combined to form that kind of Philosophical
Medicine to which Vaughan alludes. It follows that he was writing speculatively
and knew neither the Supposed Medicine nor the physical constitution of
man mortal. In these two consists our spiritual generation. " As, however,
in the rest of living thing's and also in man himself, the conjunction
of male and female tends towards a fruit and propagation becoming the nature
of each, so in man himself that interior and secret association of male
and female, to wit the copulation of male and female soul, is appointed
for the production of fitting fruit of Divine Life. And unto this does
that secret blessing and promised fecundity, that declared faculty and
warning refer : Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it : and have dominion."
<p>Out of this and some former passages the understanding reader may learn
that marriage is a comment on life, a mere hieroglyphic or outward representation
of our inward vital composition.&nbsp; For life is nothing else but an
union of male and female principles, and he that perfectly knows this secret
knows the mysteries of marriage --- both spiritual and natural --- and
how he ought to use a wife. Matrimony is no ordinary trivial business,
but in a moderate, sense sacramental. It is a visible sign of our invisible
union to Christ, which St Paul calls a great mystery ; and if the thing
signified be so reverend the signature is no <i>ex tempore</i>, contemptible
agent. But of this elsewhere. When God had thus finished His last and most
excellent creature He appointed his residence in Eden, made him His viceroy
and gave him a full jurisdiction over all His works --- that as the whole
man consisted of body and spirit so the inferior earthly creatures might
be subject to the one and the superior intellectual essences might minister
to the other. But this royalty continued not long ; for presently upon
his preferment there was a faction in the heavenly court, and the angels
scorning to attend this piece of clay contrived how to supplant him. The
first in this plot was Lucifer : Montanus tells me his name was Hilel.
He casts about to nullify that which God had enacted that so at once he
might overreach Him and His creature. This policy he imparts to some others
of the hierarchy and strengthens himself with conspirators. But there is
no counsel against God. The mischief is no sooner hatched but he and his
confederates are expelled from light to darkness. And thus rebellion is
as the sin of witchcraft : a witch is a rebel in physics and a rebel is
a witch in politics. The one acts against Nature, the other against Order
the rule of it. But both are in league with the devil, as the first father
of discord and sorcery.
<p>Satan being thus ejected --- as the condition of reprobates --- is became
more hardened in his resolutions, and to bring his malice about arrives
by permission at Eden. Here he makes woman his instrument to tempt man
and overthrow him by the same means that God made for an help to him. Adam
having thus transgressed the commandment was exposed to the lash, and in
him his posterity. But here lies the knot : how can we possibly learn his
disease if we know not the immediate efficient of it ? If I question our
divines what the forbidden fruit was I may be long enough without an answer.
Search all the schoolmen from --- Ramus to Peter Hispan --- and they have
no logic in the point. What shall we do in this case ? To speak anything
contrary to the sting of Aristotle though perhaps we hit the mark is to
expose ourselves to the common hue. But in respect I prefer a private truth
to a public error I will proceed. And now. Reader, prick up thine ears
; come on without prejudice, and I will tell thee that which never hitherto
hath been discovered.
<p>That which I now write must needs appear very strange, and incredible
to the common man, whose knowledge sticks in the bark of allegories and
mystical speeches, never apprehending that which is signified by them unto
us. This, I say, must needs sound strange with such as understand the Scriptures
in the literal, plain sense, considering not the scope and intention of
the Divine Spirit, by Whom they were first penned and delivered. Howsoever,
Origen --- being <i>unus de multis</i> and in the judgment of many wise
men the most learned of the fathers --- durst never trust himself in this
point, but always in those Scriptures where his reason could not satisfy
concluded a mystery. Certainly if it be once granted --- as some stick
not to affirm that the Tree of Knowledge was a vegetable and Eden a garden
it may be very well inferred that the Tree of Life --- being described
after the same manner, as the schoolmen express it --- was a vegetable
also. But how derogatory this is to the power of God, to the merits and
passion of Jesus Christ, Whose gift eternal life is, let any indifferent
Christian judge. Here then we have a certain entrance into Paradise, where
we may search out this Tree of Knowledge and haply learn what it is. For
seeing it must be granted that by the Tree of Life is figured the Divine
Spirit --- for it is the Spirit that quickeneth and shall one day translate
us from corruption to incorruption it will be no indiscreet inference on
the contrary that by the Tree of Knowledge is signified some sensual nature
repugnant to the spiritual, wherein our worldly, sinful affections ---
as lust, anger and the rest --- have their seat and predominate.
<p>I will now digress a while, but not much from the purpose, whereby it
may appear unto the reader that the letter is no sufficient expositor of
Scripture and that there is a great deal of difference between the sound
and the sense of the text. Dionysius the Areopagite in his Epistle to Titus
gives him this <i>caveat</i> : " To know this is notwithstanding the crown
of the work --- that there is a twofold tradition of theologians, the one
secret and mystical, the other evident and better known." And in his book
of <i>The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy</i>, written to Timotheus, he affirms
that in the primitive, apostolical times --- wherein he also lived the
Mysteries of Divinity were delivered " partly in written and partly in
unwritten canons." : Some things ne confesseth were written in the theological
books, and such are the common doctrinals of the Church now, in which notwithstanding
--- as St Peter saith --- there are many things hard to be understood.
Some things again " were communicated from mind to mind between the lines
of the written word, but some which exceeded carnal understanding were
transmitted without writing." And certainly this oral tradition was the
cause that in the subsequent ages of the Church all the Mysteries of Divinity
were lost. Nay, this very day there is not one amongst all our school doctors
or late extemporaries that knows what is represented unto us by the outward
element of water in baptism. True indeed they tell us it betokens the washing
away of sin, which we grant them, but this is not the full signification
for which it was ordained. It hath been the common error of all times to
mistake signum for signatum, the shell for the kernel. Yet to prevent this
it was that Dionysius wrote his book of <i>The Celestial Hierarchy</i>
and especially his <i>Theologia Significativa</i>, of which there is such
frequent mention made in his works. Verily our Saviour Himself, Who is
blessed for evermore, did sometimes speak in parables, and commanded further
that pearls should not be cast forth unto swine, for "it is not given to
all men to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven."&nbsp; Supposing
then --- as it is most true --- that amongst other mystical speeches contained
in Scripture this of the Garden of Eden and the Tree in it is one, I shall
proceed to the exposition of it in some measure, concealing the particulars
notwithstanding.
<p>Man in the beginning --- I mean the substantial, inward man --- both
in and after his creation, for some short time, was a pure intellectual
essence, free from all fleshly, sensual affections. In this state the <i>anima</i>
or sensitive nature did not prevail over the spiritual, as it doth now
in us. For the superior mental part of man was united to God by an essential
contact and the Divine Light --- being received in and conveyed to the
inferior portions of the soul --- did mortify all carnal desires, insomuch
that in Adam the sensitive faculties were scarce at all employed, the spiritual
prevailing over them in him, as they do over the spiritual now in us. Hence
we read in Scripture that during the state of innocence he did not know
that he was naked ; but no sooner eats he of the Tree of Knowledge but
he saw his nakedness and was ashamed of it --- wherefore also he hides
himself amongst the trees of the Garden, and when God calls to him he replies
: " I heard thy voice in the Garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked
; and I hid myself." But God, knowing his former state, answers him with
a question : " Who told thee that thou wast naked ? Hast thou eaten of
the Tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ? " Here
we see a twofold state of man : his first and best in the spiritual, substantial
union of his intellectual parts to God and the mortification of his ethereal,
sensitive nature, wherein the fleshly, sinful affections had their residence
; his second --- or his fall --- in the eating of the forbidden fruit,
which did cast asleep his. intellectual faculties but did stir up and exalt
the sensual. "For" --- saith the serpent --- " God doth know that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the Tree was good
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired
to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both
were opened, and they knew that they were naked." Thus we see the sensual
faculties revived in our first parents and brought from potentiality into
activity --- as the schoolmen speak --- by virtue of this forbidden fruit.
Neither did this eating suppress the intellectual powers in Adam only but
in all his generations after him ; for the influence of this fruit passed,
together with his nature, into his posterity. We are all born like Moses
with a veil over the face. This is it which hinders the prospect of that
intellectual shining light which God hath placed in us ; and --- to tell
you a truth that concerns all mankind --- the greatest mystery, both in
divinity and philosophy, is how to remove it.
<p>It will not be amiss to speak something in this place of the nature
and constitution of man, to make that more plain which already hath been
spoken. As the great world consists of three parts --- the elemental, the
celestial and the spiritual --- above all which God Himself is seated in
that infinite, inaccessible light which streams from His own nature, even
so man hath in him his earthly, elemental parts, together with the celestial
and angelical natures, in the centre of all which moves and shines the
Divine Spirit. The normal, celestial, ethereal part of man is that whereby
we do move, see, feel, taste and smell, and have a commerce with all material
objects whatsoever. It is the same in us as in beasts, and it is derived
from heaven --- where it is predominant --- to all the inferior earthly
creatures. In plain terms it is part of the Soul of the World,&nbsp; commonly
called the Medial Soul because the influences of the Divine Nature are
conveyed through it to the more material parts of the creature, with which
of themselves they have no proportion. By means of this Medial Soul, or
the ethereal nature, man is made subject to the influence of stars and
is partly disposed of by the celestial. harmony. For this middle spirit
--- middle, I mean, between both extremes and not that which actually unites
the whole together --- as well that which is in the outward heaven as that
which is in man, is of a fruitful, insinuating nature and carried with
a strong desire to multiply itself, so that the celestial form stirs up
and excites the elemental. For this spirit is in man, in beasts, in vegetables,
in minerals ; and in everything it is the mediate cause of composition
and multiplication. Neither should any wonder that I affirm this spirit
to be in minerals because the operations of it are not discerned there.
For shall we conclude therefore that there is no inward agent that actuates
and specifies those passive, indefinite principles whereof they are compounded
? Tell me not now of blind Peripatetical forms and qualities. A form is
that which Aristotle could not define substantially, nor any of his followers
after him, and therefore they are not competent judges of it. But --- I
beseech you --- are not the faculties of this spirit suppressed in man
also, as it appeareth in those that are blind ? But notwithstanding the
eye only is destroyed and not the visible power, for that remains, as it
is plain in their dreams. Now, this vision is performed by a reflection
of the visual radii in their inward, proper cell. For Nature employs her
gifts only where she finds a convenience and fit disposition of organs,
which being not in minerals we may not expect so clear an expression of
the natural powers in them. Notwithstanding, in the flowers of several
vegetables --- which in some sort represent the eyes --- there is a more
subtle, acute perception of heat and cold, and other celestial influences,
than in any other part. This is manifest in those herbs which open at the
rising and shut towards the sunset, which motion is caused by the spirit
being sensible of the approach and departure of the sun. For indeed the
flowers are --- as it were --- the spring of the spirit, where it breaks
forth and streams, as it appears by the odours that are more celestial
and comfortable there. Again, this is more evident in the plant-animals
--- as the vegetable lamb, <i>Arbor casta</i>, and several others. But
this will not sink with any but such as have seen this spirit separated
from his elements --- where I leave it for this time.
<p>Next to this sensual nature of man is the angelical or rational spirit.
This spirit adheres sometimes to the Mens, or superior portion of the soul,
and then it is filled with the Divine Light. But more commonly it descends
into the ethereal, inferior portion which St Paul calls the natural man,
where it is altered by the celestial influences and diversely distracted
with the irregular affections and passions of the sensual nature.
<p>Lastly, above the rational spirit is the Mem or hidden intelligence,&nbsp;
commonly called the illuminated intellect, and of Moses the breath of lives.
This is that spirit which God Himself breathed into man and by which man
is united. again to God. Now, as the Divine Light, flowing into the <i>Mens</i>,
did assimilate and convert the inferior portions of the soul to God, so
--- on the contrary --- the Tree of Knowledge did obscure and darken the
superior portions but awaked and stirred up the animal, sinful nature.
The sum of all is this : man, as long as he continued in his union to God,
knew the good only --- that is, the things that were of God. But as soon
as he stretched forth his hand and did eat of the forbidden fruit --- that
is, the middle soul or spirit of the greater world --- presently upon his
disobedience and transgression of the commandment, his union to the Divine
Nature was dissolved ; and his spirit being united to the spirit of the
world he knew the evil only, that is, the things that were of the world.
True it is he knew the good and the evil, but the evil in a far greater
measure than the good.
<p>Some sparks of grace were left, and though the perfection of innocence
was lost upon his Fall from the Divine Light, yet conscience remained still
with him --- partly to direct, partly to punish. Thus you see that this
medial soul or middle spirit is figured by the Tree of Knowledge ; but
he that knows why the Tree of Life is said to be in the midst of the Garden
and to grow out of the ground will more fully understand that which we
have spoken. We see, moreover, that the faculties ascribed to the Tree
of Knowledge are to be found only in middle nature. First, it is said to
be a tree to be desired to make one wise ; but it was fleshly, sensual
wisdom, the wisdom of this world and not of God. Secondly, it is said to
be good for food and pleasant to the eyes. So is the middle nature also,
for it is the only medicine to repair the decays of the natural man and
to continue our bodies in their primitive strength and integrity Lastly,
that I may speak something for myself : this is no new unheard-of fancy,
as the understanding reader may gather out of Trismegistus. Nay, I am verily
of opinion that the Egyptians received this knowledge from the Hebrews,
who lived a long time amongst them as it appears out of Scripture --- and
that they delivered it over to the Grecians. This is plain out of lamblichus,
in his book <i>De Mysteriis</i>, where he hath these words : "The man of
understanding, unveiled before himself, was of old united to the contemplation
of the gods ; but it came about afterwards that another soul entered into
possession, intermixed with the form pf man, and for this cause he is saddled
with the yoke of necessity and fate." And what else, I beseech you, is
signified unto us in that poetical fable of Prometheus, that he should
steal a certain fire from heaven, for which trespass God punished the world
with a great many diseases and mortality ?
<p>But somebody may reply : seeing that God made all things very good ---
as it appears in His review of the creatures on the sixth day --- how could
it be a sin in Adam to eat that which in itself was good ? Verily the sin
was not grounded in the nature of that which he did eat, but it was the
inference of the commandment, inasmuch as he was forbidden to eat it. And
this is that which St Paul tells us --- that he had not known sin, had
it not been for the Law. And again, in another place : " The strength of
sin is the Law." But presently upon the disobedience of the first man and
his transgression of&nbsp; the commandment, the creature was made subject
to vanity. For the curse followed and the impure seeds were joined with
the pure, and they reign to this hour in our bodies ; and not in us alone
but in every other natural thing. Hence it is we read in Scripture that
" the heavens " themselves " are not clean in His sight." And to this alludes
the apostle in that speech of his to the Colossians, that " it pleased
the Father ... to reconcile all things to himself" by Christ, "whether
they be things in earth, or things in heaven." : And here you are to observe
that Cornelius Agrippa mistook the act of generation for original sin,
which indeed was the effect of it : and. this is the only point in which
he hath miscarried.
<p>I have now done : only a word more concerning the situation of Paradise,
and the rather because of the diversity of opinions concerning that solace
and the absurdity of them. St Paul, in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
discovers it in these words :&nbsp; " I knew a man in Christ about fourteen
years ago --- whether in the body, I cannot tell ; or whether out of the
body, I cannot tell : God knoweth --- such an one caught up to the Third
Heaven. And I knew such a man whether in the body, or out of the body,
I cannot tell : God knoweth --- how that he was caught up into Paradise."&nbsp;
Here you see that Paradise and 'the Third Heaven are convertible terms,
so that the one discovers the other. Much more could I have said concerning
the Tree of Knowledge, being in itself a large and very mystical subject
; but for my part I rest contented with my own particular apprehension
and desire not to enlarge it any further. Neither had I committed this
much to paper but out of my love to the truth, and that I would not have
these thoughts altogether to perish.
<p>You see now --- if you be not men of a most dense head --- how man fell,
and by consequence you may guess by what means he is to rise. He must be
united to the Divine Light, from whence by disobedience he was separated.
A flash or tincture of this must come or he can no more discern things
spiritually . than he can distinguish colours naturally without the light
of the sun. This light descends and is united to him by the same means
as his soul was at first. I speak not here of the symbolical, exterior
descent from the prototypical planets to the created spheres and thence
into " the night of the body " ; but I speak of that most secret and silent
lapse of the spirit " through the degrees of natural forms " ; and this
is a mystery not easily apprehended. It is a Kabalistic maxim that "no
spiritual being descending here below can operate without a garment." Consider
well of it with yourselves, and take heed you wander not in the circumference.
The soul of man, whiles she is in the body, is like a candle shut up in
a dark lanthorn, or a fire that is almost stifled for want of air. Spirits
say the Platonics --- when they are " in their own country " are like the
inhabitants of green fields who live perpetually amongst flowers, in a
spicy, odorous air ; but here below, " in the circle of generation," they
mourn because of darkness and solitude, like people locked up in a pest-house.
" Here do they fear, desire and grieve," &amp;c.&nbsp; This is it makes
the soul subject to so many passions, to such a Proteus of humours. Now
she flourishes, now she withers now a smile, now a tear ; and when she
hath played out her stock, then comes a repetition of the same fancies,
till at last she cries out with Seneca : " How long this self-same round
? "&nbsp; This is occasioned by her vast and infinite capacity, which is
satisfied with nothing but God, from Whom at first she descended. It is
miraculpus to consider how she struggles with her chains when man is in
extremity, how she falsifies with fortune, what pomp, what pleasure, what
a paradise doth she propose to herself. She spans kingdoms in a thought
and enjoys all that inwardly which she misseth outwardly. In her are patterns
and notions of all things in the world. If she but fancies herself in the
midst of the sea, presently she is there and hears the rushing of the billows.
She makes an invisible voyage from one place to another and presents to
herself things absent as if they were present. The dead live to her : there
is no grave can hide them from her thoughts. Now she is here in dirt and
mire, and in a trice above the moon.
<blockquote>Far over storms she soars, hears rushing clouds
<br>Beneath her feet, and the blind thunder spurns.</blockquote>
But this is nothing. If she were once out of the body she could act all
that she imagined. " In a moment," saith Agrippa " whatsoever she desires,
-that shall follow." In this state she can "act upon the moods of the macrocosm,"
make general commotions in the two spheres of air and water, and alter
the complexions of times. Neither is this a fable but the unanimous finding
of the Arabians, with the two princes Avicebron and Avicenna. She hath
then an absolute power in miraculous and more than natural transmutations.
She can in an instant transfer her own vessel from one place to another.
She can --- by an union with universal force --- infuse and communicate
her thoughts to the absent, be the distance never so great. Neither is
there anything under the sun but she may know it, and --- remaining only
in one place --- she can acquaint herself with the actions of all places
whatsoever. I omit to speak of her magnet, wherewith she can attract all
things --- as well spiritual as natural. Finally, " there is no work in
the whole course of Nature, however arduous, however excellent, however
supernatural it may be, that the human soul, when it has attained the source
of its divinity --- which the Magi term the soul standing and not falling
--- cannot accomplish by its own power and apart from any external help."
But who is he --- amidst so many thousand philosophisers --- that knows
her nature substantially and the genuine, specifical use thereof ? This
is Abraham's "great secret, wonderful exceedingly, and deeply hidden, sealed
with six seals, and out of these proceed fire, water and air, which are
divided into males and females." We should therefore pray continually that
God would open our eyes, whereby we might see to employ that talent which
He hath bestowed upon us but lies buried now in the ground and doth not
fructify at all. He it is to Whom we must be united by " an essential contact,"
and then we shall know all things " shewn forth openly by clear vision
in the Divine Light." This influx from Him is the true, proper efficient
of our regeneration, that <i>sperma</i> of St John, the seed of God which
remains in us. If this be once obtained we need not serve under Aristotle
or Galen, nor trouble ourselves with foolish <i>utrums</i> and <i>ergos</i>
for His unction will instruct us in all things.
<p>But indeed the doctrine of the schoolmen, which in a manner makes God
and Nature contraries, hath so weakened our confidence towards Heaven that
we look upon all receptions from thence as impossibilities. But if things
were well weighed and this cloud of tradition removed we should quickly
find that God is more ready to give than we are to receive. For He made
man --- as it were --- for His playfellow, that he might survey and examine
His works. The inferior creatures He made not for themselves but His own
glory, which glory He could not receive from anything so perfectly as from
man, who --- having in him the spirit of discretion --- might judge of
the beauty of the creature and consequently praise the Creator. Wherefore
also God gave him the use of all His works ; and in Paradise how familiar
is He, or rather how doth He play with Adam. "Out of the ground" --- saith
the Scripture --- "the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every
fowl of the air ; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call
them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name
thereof." These were the books which God ordained for Adam and for us his
posterity, not the quintessence of Aristotle nor the temperament of Galen
the Antichrist. But this is " tormenting the hornets." ' Now will the Peripatetics
brand me with their <i>contra principia</i> and the school divines with
a <i>tradatur Satanae</i> . I know I shall be hated of most for my pains
and perhaps scoffed at like Pythagoras in Lucian :' " Who buyeth Eugenius
? Who seeketh to be more than a man, or to know the harmony of the world
and be born again ? " But because, according to their own master, a covenant
is honourable&nbsp; and that an affirmative of this nature cannot fall
to the ground with a Christian, I will come to my oath. I do therefore
protest before my glorious God, I have not written this out of malice but
out of zeal and affection to the truth of my Creator. Let them take heed
then lest --- whiles they contemn mysteries --- they violate the majesty
of God in His creatures and trample the blood of the covenant under foot.
But shall I not be counted a conjurer, seeing I follow the principles of
Cornelius Agrippa, that grand Archimagus, as the antichristian Jesuits
call him ? He indeed is my author, and next to God I owe all that I have
unto him. He was, Reader, by extraction noble ; by religion a protestant
--- as it appears out of his own writings --- besides the late but malicious
testimony of Promondus, a learned papist ; for his course of life a man
famous in his person, both for actions of war and peace ; a favourite to
the greatest princes of his time and the just wonder of all learned men.
Lastly, he was one that carried himself above the miseries he was born
to and made fortune know man might be her master. This is answer enough
to a few sophisters --- and in defiance of all calumnies --- thus I salute
his memory.
<blockquote>Great, glorious penman, whom I should not name
<br>Lest I might seem to measure thee by fame,
<br>Nature's apostle and her choice high priest,
<br>Her mystical and bright evangelist :
<br>How am I rapt when I contemplate thee
<br>And wind myself above all that I see.
<br>The spirits of thy lines infuse a fire ---
<br>Like the world's soul --- which makes me thus aspire
<br>I am embodied by thy books and thee
<br>And in thy papers find my ecstacy ;
<br>Or, if I please but to descend a strain,
<br>Thy elements do screen my soul again.
<br>I can undress myself by thy bright glass
<br>And then resume the enclosure as I was.
<br>Now I am earth, and now a star, and then
<br>A spirit --- now a star and earth again ;
<br>Or if I will but ransack all that be
<br>In the least moment I engross all three.
<br>I span the heaven and earth and things above,
<br>And --- which is more --- join natures with their love.
<p>He crowns my soul with fire and there doth shine,
<br>But like the rainbow in a cloud of mine.
<br>Yet there's a law by which I discompose
<br>The ashes and the fire itself disclose ;
<br>But in his emerald still he doth appear :
<br>They are but grave-clothes which he scatters here.
<br>Who sees this fire without his mask, his eye
<br>Must needs be swallow'd by the light and die.
<br>These are the mysteries for which I wept ---
<br>Glorious Agrippa --- when thy language slept.
<br>Where thy dark texture made me wander far,
<br>Whiles through that pathless night I traced the star ;
<br>But I have found those mysteries for which
<br>Thy book was more than thrice-piled o'er with pitch.
<br>Now a new East beyond the stars I see
<br>Where breaks the day of thy divinity.
<br>Heaven states a commerce here with man, had he
<br>But grateful hands to take and eyes to see.
<p>Hence, you fond schoolmen, that high truth deride,
<br>And with no arguments but noise and pride
<br>You that damn all but what yourselves invent
<br>And yet find nothing by experiment :
<br>Your fate is written by an unseen hand,
<br>But his Three Books with the Three Worlds shall stand.</blockquote>
Thus far, Reader, I have handled the composition and royalty of man. I
shall now speak something of his dissolution and close up my discourse
--- as he doth his life --- with death. Death is'" a recession of life
into the hiddenness " --- not the annihilation of any one particle but
a retreat of hidden natures to the same state they were in before they
were manifested. This is occasioned by the ' disproportion and inequality
of the matter; for when the harmony, is broken by the excess of any one
principle, the vital twist --- without a timely reduction of the first
unity ---&nbsp; disbands and unravels. In this recess the several ingredients
of man return to those several elements from whence they came at first
in their access to a compound. For to think that God creates anything <i>ex
nihilo</i> in the work of generation is a pure metaphysical whimsey. Thus
the earthly parts --- as we see by experience --- return to the earth,
the celestial to a superior heavenly limbus and the spirit to God that
gave it. Neither should any wonder that I affirm the Spirit of the living
God to be in man, when God Himself doth acknowledge it for His own. " My
spirit " --- saith He --- " shall not always be sheathed " --- for so the
Hebrew signifies --- " in man, for that he also is flesh : yet his days
shall be an hundred and twenty years." Besides, the breathing of it into
Adam proves it proceeded from God and therefore the Spirit of God.
<p>Thus Christ breathed on His apostles and they received the Holy Ghost.
In Ezekiel the Spirit comes from the four winds and breathes upon the slain,
that they might live. Now, this Spirit was the Spirit of Life, the same
with that Breath of Life which was breathed into the first man, and he
became a living soul. But without doubt the Breath or Spirit of Life is
the Spirit of God. Neither is this Spirit in man alone but in all the great
world, though after another manner. For God breathes continually and passeth
through all things like an air that refresheth --- wherefore also He is
called of Pythagoras " the quickening of all." Hence it is that God in
Scripture hath several names, according to those several offices He performs
in the preservation of His creature. " Moreover"&nbsp; --- saith the Areopagite
--- "they bear witness to His presence in our minds, as also in our souls
and even in our bodies, that He is in heaven and on earth, and simultaneously
in His very self : they declare Him to be within the world, to be around
and also above it, over and above heaven, the superior essence, sun, star,
fire, water, wind, dew, cloud, the very stone and rock : to be in all things
which are and Himself to be nothing which they are." And most certain it
is because of His secret passage and penetration through all that other
simile in Dionysius was given Him : "Let that also be added which may seem
vilest and most absurd of all, that the Lord hath called Himself a worm
of the earth, as handed down to us by those versed in divine things."
<p>Now, this figurative kind of speech, with its variety of appellations,
is not only proper to Holy Writ but the Egyptians also --- as Plutarch
tells me --- called Isis, or the most secret part of Nature, myrionymous
; and certainly that the same thing should have a thousand names is no
news to such as have studied the Philosopher's Stone. But to return thither
whence we have digressed : I told you the several principles of man in
his dissolution part --- as sometimes friends do --- several ways : earth
to earth --- as our Liturgy hath it and heaven to heaven, according to
that of Lucretius :
<blockquote>The part which came from earth to earth returns,
<br>But what descended from ethereal shores
<br>High heaven's resplendent temples welcome back.</blockquote>
But more expressly the divine Vergil, speaking of his bees :
<blockquote>Induced by such examples, some have taught
<br>That bees have portions of ethereal thought ---
<br>Endued with particles of heavenly fires ;
<br>For God the whole created mass inspires.
<br>Through heaven and earth and ocean's depths He throws
<br>His influence round and kindles as He goes.
<br>Hence flocks and herds and men and beasts and fowls
<br>With breath are quicken'd, and attract their souls ;
<br>Hence take the forms His prescience did ordain,
<br>And into Him at length resolve again.
<br>No room is left for death : they mount the sky
<br>And to their own congenial planets fly.</blockquote>
This vanish or ascent of the inward, ethereal principles doth not presently
follow their separation ; for that part of man which Paracelsus calls the
" sidereal man " and more appositely the " brute part of man," but Agrippa
the " spectre "&nbsp; and Vergil
<blockquote>Ethereal sense and warmth of simple breath ---</blockquote>
this part --- I say --- which in the astral man hovers sometimes about
the dormitories of the dead, and that because of the magnetism or sympathy
which is between him and the radical, vital moisture. In this " spectre
" is the seat of the imagination, and it retains after death an impress
of those passions and affections to which it was subject in the body. This
makes him haunt those places where the whole man hath been most conversant,
and imitate the actions and gestures of life. This magnetism is excellently
confirmed by that memorable accident at Paris which Dr Fludd proves to
be true by the testimonies of great and learned men. Agrippa also, speaking
of the apparitions of the dead, hath these words : " But that which I have
seen myself with my own eyes and have touched with my own hands I will
not mention in this place, lest it be my lot to be accused of falsehood
by the ignorant, by reason of the marvellous strangeness of the occurrences."&nbsp;
But this scene exceeds not the circuit of one year, for when the body begins
fully to corrupt the spirit returns to his original element. These apparitions
have made a great noise in the world, not without some benefit to the pope
; but I shall reserve all for my great work, where I shall more fully handle
these mysteries.
<p>I am now to speak of man as he is subject to a supernatural judgment
; and --- to be short --- my judgment is this : I conceive there are ---
besides the empyreal heaven --- two inferior mansions or receptacles of
spirits. The one is that which our Saviour calls "the outer darkness,"
and this is jt whence there is no redemption" Whence souls may never come
forth," as the divine Plato hath it. The other, I suppose, is somewhat
answerable to the Elysian fields, some delicate, pleasant region, the suburbs
of heaven --- as it were --- those seven mighty mountains whereupon there,
grow roses and lilies, or the outgoings of Paradise in Esdras. Such was
that place where the oracle told Amelius the soul of Plotinus was :
<blockquote>Where friendship is, where Cupid gentle-eyed,
<br>Replete with purest joy, enrich'd by God
<br>With sempiternal and ambrosial streams :
<br>Whence are the bonds of love, the pleasant breath,
<br>The tranquil air of great Jove's golden race.</blockquote>
Stellatus supposeth there is a successive, gradual ascent of the soul,
according to the process of expiation, and he makes her inter-residence
in the moon. But let it be where it will, my opinion is that this middlemost
mansion is appointed for such souls whose whole man hath not perfectly
repented in this world. But notwithstanding they are of such as shall be
saved, and are reserved in this place to a further repentance in the spirit
for those offences they committed in the flesh. I do not here maintain
that <i>ignis fatuus</i> of purgatory, or any such painted, imaginary tophet
; but that which I speak of --- if I am not much mistaken --- I have a
strong Scripture for. It is that of St Peter, where he speaks of Christ
being " put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit : by which
also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ; which sometime were
disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah,
while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved
by water." These spirits were the souls of those who perished in the Flood
and were reserved in this place till Christ should come and preach repentance
unto them.
<p>I know Scaliger thinks to evade this construction with his <i>qui tunc</i>,
that they were then alive --- namely, before the Flood --- when they were
preached unto. But I shall overthrow this single' nonsense with three solid
reasons, drawn out of the body of the text. First, it is not said that
the Spirit itself precisely preached unto them, but He Who went thither
by the Spirit, namely, Christ in the&nbsp; hypostatical union of His soul
and Godhead --- which union was not before the Flood when these dead did
live. Secondly, it is written that He preached unto spirits, not to men,
to those which were in prison, not to those which were " in life," which
is quite contrary to Scaliger. And this exposition the apostle confirms
in another place --- " to them that are dead " --- the dead were preached
to, not the living. Thirdly, the apostle says these spirits were but sometime
disobedient and withal tells us when namely, in the days of Noah. Whence
I gather they were not disobedient at this time of preaching ; and this
is plain out of the subsequent chapter. " For this cause" --- saith the
apostle --- "was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they
might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God
in the spirit." Now, this judgment in the flesh was grounded on their disobedience
in the days of Noah, for which also they were drowned; but salvation according
to God in the spirit proceeded from their repentance at the preaching of
Christ, which was after death. I do not impose this on the reader as if
I sat in the infallible chair, but I am confident the text of itself will
speak no other sense. As for the doctrine, it is no way hurtful-, but in
my opinion as it detracts not from the mercy of God so it adds much to
the comfort of man.
<p>I shall now speak a word more concerning myself and another concerning
the common philosophy, and then I have done. It will be questioned perhaps
what I am, and especially what my religion is. Take this short answer.
I am neither papist nor sectary but a true, resolute protestant in the
best sense of the Church of England. For philosophy as it now stands it
is altogether imperfect and withal false --- a mere apothecary's drug,
a mixture of inconsistent, contrary principles which no way agree with
the harmony and method of Nature. In a word, the whole encyclopaedia ---
as they call it --- baiting the demonstrative, mathematical part --- is
built on mere imagination, without the least light of experience. I wish
therefore all the true sons of my famous Oxford Mother to look beyond Aristotle
and not to confine their intellect to the narrow and cloudy horizon of
his text ; for he is as short of Nature as the grammarians are of steganography.
I expect not their thanks for this my advice or discovery ; but verily
the time will come when this truth shall be more perfectly manifested,
and especially that great and glorious mystery whereof there is little
spoken in this book : " the alone King Messias, the Word made flesh of
the Father, hath revealed this secret, to be more openly manifested in
a certain fulness of time."
<p>It is Cornelius Agrippa's own prediction, and I am confident it shall
find patrons enough when nothing remains here of me but memory.
<blockquote>My sweetest Jesus, 'twas Thy voice : If I
<br>Be lifted up I'll draw all to the sky.
<br>Yet I am here. I'm stifled in this clay,
<br>Shut up from Thee and the fresh East of day.
<br>I know Thy hand's not short ; but I'm unfit ---
<br>A foul, unclean thing --- to take hold of it.
<br>I am all dirt, nor can I hope to please
<br>Unless in mercy Thou lov'st a disease.
<br>Diseases may be cured ; but who'll reprieve
<br>Him that is dead ? Tell me, my God, I live.
<br>'Tis true, I live ; but I so sleep withal
<br>I cannot move, scarce hear when Thou dost call.
<br>Sin's lullabies charm me when I would come ;
<br>But draw me after Thee and I will run.
<br>Thou know'st I'm sick : let me not feasted be,
<br>But keep a diet, and prescribed by Thee.
<br>Should I carve for myself I would exceed
<br>To surfeits soon and by self-murder bleed.
<br>I ask for stones and scorpions, but still cross'd ---
<br>And all for love --- should'st Thou grant, I were lost.
<br>Dear Lord, deny me still, and never sign ---
<br>My will but when that will agrees with Thine.
<br>And when this conflict's pass'd and I appear
<br>To answer what a patient I was here,
<br>How I did weep when Thou didst woo, repine
<br>At Thy best sweets and in a childish whine
<br>Refuse Thy proffer'd love, yet cry and call
<br>For rattles of my own, to play withal ---
<br>Look on Thy cross and let Thy blood come in.
<br>When mine shall blush as guilty of my sin,
<br>Then shall I live, being rescued in my fall,
<br>A text of mercy to Thy creatures all,
<br>Who having seen the worst of sins in me
<br>Must needs confess the best of loves in Thee.</blockquote>
I have now done, Reader, but how much to my own prejudice I cannot tell.
I am confident this shall not pass without noise ; but I may do well enough
if thou grantest me but one request. I would not have thee look here for
the paint and trim of rhetoric, and the rather because English is a language
the author was not born to. Besides this piece was composed in haste and
in my days of mourning on the sad occurrence of a brother's death. " And
who " knoweth how to write amidst a wailing of tears and ink."
<p>To conclude : if I have erred in anything --- and yet I followed the
rules of creation --- I expose it not to the mercy of man but of God, Who
as He is most able so also is "He most willing to forgive us in the day
of our accounts.
