<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most beloved son, so that I might explain to you,
and write as a memorial a concise understanding of the one, true philosopher’s
stone, and of how to proceed with its preparation, you must know that this
stone is made of and born of two things, namely <i>ex corpore et spiritu</i>,
of the male and female seeds, that is, of water of mercury and <i>corpore
solis</i>. We can find enough proof of this in the many true writing of
the philosophers, and so I will mention many of the writings they left
behind. Then it will be seen how the purified <i>mercurius</i> is poured
into and dissolved in a spiritual water. The philosophers call this the
<i>prima
materia</i> of metals. They also call it <i>lunae water, aqua vitae, Q.
Essentia</i>, or a fiery and burning liquid liquor. The metals can be dissolved
and freed from their hard, stiff bonds in this water, and so return to
their first, their original nature, just as the water of mercury has done.
This is why the philosophers wrote for us in their books the example of
how frozen ice turns to water again when heated, for it was water before
its coagulation too. They also say that whenever an object’s origins or
principalis might be, it can be returned to that original state in this
way. It will become that which it was in the beginning. The philosophers
also wrote on the following subject in their books; that the species of
metal cannot be turned into gold or silver if they have not first been
reduced and returned to their original material. Note carefully, my son,
that this reincarnation of the metals is possible only if the <i>prima
materia metallorum</i>, or water of mercury, is used. It is not possible,
and never will be possible with any other substance in the world. For this
water is closest to the nature of the metals, and so it can never be separated
or parted from them when the two are mixed. The philosophers have also
given us explanations of this water in the ‘<i>Turba</i>’ and in other
books in which they say the following: Nature enjoys its Nature, Nature
contains Nature, improves Nature, reduces Nature, Nature is superior to
Nature. This is how we can recognize this blessed water and its preparation:
It is a heated, fiery, all-penetrating spiritus, the philosophical water
and the hidden key to this art. For without it all alchemical works are
useless and in vain. So, my son, you must understand and remember that
the whole basis of the philosopher’s stone is this: That we can bring about
a rebirth of the perfect and whole corpus solis, through the <i>prima materia
metallorum</i>, or water of mercury, so that it is reborn through the water
and the spirit, just as Christ says: Unless a man has been reborn through
the water and the spirit he can never see the Kingdom of God. And so it
is with this art. I say to you, my son, unless the <i>corpus solis</i>
is sown, it is useless and fruitless, just as Christ says. Unless the grain
of wheat falls onto the earth and dies there and rots, then it will bear
no fruit. In this way the <i>corpus solis</i> is reborn through the water
and the spirit, and immediately a clearer, more astral, eternal and immortal
body grows from it, which bears fruit and multiplies like the <i>vegetabilia</i>.
On this subject the philosopher Rogerus Baco says: I assure you, thus will
the <i>astrum</i>, give of itself to the body of gold which has been clarified
in this way, so that it will never lose its riches and its strength until
the day of the Last Judgment. For the body is perfect, purified of all
other elements and it is beautiful. But unless it is reborn it will never
become anything bigger, or clearer, or higher or better. Unless you know
and recognize this rebirth from Nature and new birth of metals through
the water and the spirit of the <i>prima materia</i>, it is futile to practice
this art. For believe me, in all truth, without this all is false, a lie,
and useless, and in vain. It is impossible for it to happen in any other
way. Because of this the philosophers wrote wonderfully in their books
and said that everything bears an image of itself and that man will reap
what he sows, and nothing else. In the same way the philosopher Angelicus
said: Sow gold and silver so that they can bear fruit by Nature’s means.
For this reason, my son, you must search in your work for a corpus other
than gold, for all other corpora are stinking and incomplete. And so the
philosophers have chosen gold above all other bodies as the most complete
thing in the world, as the substance which lights up all other corpora
and which pours life into them, while it has a fixed nature, an unburnable
nature and a constant root in the fire. Rogerius also says of the body
of gold that its nobility and perfection can never be altered, and that
gold is the culmination of all natural births, and that nothing in the
world is more complete. The philosopher Isaacus Hollandus speaks of the
same substance in this way: Our stone can be extracted from nothing other
than a perfect corpore, yes, from the most complete one in the world. If
it were not a perfect corpus, what sort of stone could we extract from
it? The stone must have the power to give life to all dead corpora, to
purify all that is impure, to make all that is hard and to make all that
is hard soft, and it would be truly impossible to extract such a powerful
stone from an incomplete and frail corpore, just as it is also impossible
to extract a good and perfect thing from something imperfect and unclean.
How many people deceive themselves that such an extraction is possible,
but they are always mistaken, and in truth they are great fools. Therefore
my son, take care that the red philosophical sulphur is in the gold, as
Richardus proved and King Calid said. Our sulphur is no common sulphur,
but is fixed from mercurial nature and does not flee the fire. All other
philosophers also confirm that their red sulphur is gold.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, my son, the philosophers also say in their books
that common gold or silver is not their gold or silver. While their gold
and silver is alive, common gold and silver are dead, and as such cannot
perfect other, incomplete corpora, nor impart their completeness to them.
If they had to give away some of their perfection they would remain incomplete
themselves, for they would have no more perfection. Now my son, the words
of the philosophers are true and founded on fact, for it is impossible
for common gold and silver to make other, complete corpora perfect, unless,
as I said before, the <i>corpus Solis</i> and <i>Lunae</i>, is reborn through
the water and spirit of the prima material and an enlightened spiritual,
clarified, eternal, fixed and subtle, all penetrating body grows from this
which will purify other perfect corpora and multiply. Therefore the philosophers
have said of this: Such works are performed on their stone so that the
tincture in it can be improved. This is why it is necessary for this stone
to be treated better and more subtly than common gold and silver. The philosopher
Berhardus writes on this subject in his book. He says: We take this body
just as Nature created it. But it is necessary to make to make it even
more perfect using this art (which must still follow the rules of nature)
so that it, in its great perfection and with its many rays, can make the
imperfect corpora and complete in weight, colour, substance, yes even its
mineral origins and <i>principiis</i>. And if it had remained in the sate
in which Nature would normally have left it, if it had not been perfected
or made superior, how would the period of ten and a half months served
us then? Arnoldus speaks on this very subject in his Epistle: In our stone
gold and silver are to be found more strongly, invisibly and more maturely
in <i>potentia et virtute</i>, for if this were not so, neither gold nor
silver in our stone are to be found in great strength and in their essence
in their stone, but they are not as visible as common gold or silver. Euclides
confirms this in his great ‘<i>Rosario</i>’: Nothing can come from one
perfect things, he says, for it is already perfect and complete, just as
Nature created it. We find a similar example in bread: When yeast-risen
bread can be made from it. So it is too with gold, which is brought by
nature over a long period of time to a complete end. It is therefore impossible
to perfect other corpora with bad gold, unless the perfect corpus solis
is dissolved again, so that it returns to its original substance, and it
is turned into a true ferment and tincture through our work and art. On
this subject the philosophers say that one can never achieve a good result
until the gold and silver are joined together in one corpus. Now, my son,
do not read the words literally, but understand the lumen metaphorice,
for the philosophers say in their books that Luna is made of cold and wet
Nature, and they also give this same definition to <i>mercurio</i>. So,
for <i>Lunam</i>, we read <i>mercurius</i>, or water of mercury, or <i>prima
materia</i> which is the philosophers <i>luna</i> or <i>Lunae</i> water,
as can be read in the wonderful and profound book ‘<i>Clangor Buccinae</i>’.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, my son, you have had a short lesson that
this art is useless unless we bring the perfecta corpora back to its original
essence by the philosophical fire or by the water of mercury. This original
essence is a sulphuric water and not <i>mercurius vivus</i> as the sophists
believe. For the original <i>materia metallorum</i> is not <i>mercurius
vivus</i>, but a sticky sulphuric steam and a viscous water in which the
three <i>principia</i> Sal, Sulphur, and Mercurius are gathered. You must
be able to recognize the true and blessed water of mercury or the heavenly
supernatural fire in which the corpora are dissolved and melted. For this
knowledge is the greatest secret of them all, and it is only found in the
power of God, whom we must beg for the secret. Of this the philosopher
Rogerius says: God the Almighty created man and set him above Nature and
all the animals, although he is natural and nothing more than Nature, apart
from the life which God breathed into him. And it is God who is and must
be the judge of all the works and their nature. This godly spirit within
man forms our feelings and thoughts, just as it does in its own head. The
natural spirit found in the first beginnings of Nature many indications
on which it could base and found these thoughts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our work and through this spirit in us God-like
Adam makes us ready for the destruction of the whole world. And from the
lit, burning, fiery spirit of the breath of God, St Peter utters with quiet
words that the elements will melt in the heat and the earth and all her
works will burn in it, and a new world will be born, and it will be wonderful
and precious and good, as is told in the <i>Apocalypsi</i>. And on this
subject the philosopher concludes, saying, as we heard from St Peter, that
a collapse of all the elements of the world shall occur in the heat of
the fire. Take note that in this art too (which reflects nature) here too
the fire must do this and perform these acts. Then, my son, turn your thoughts
to the water which is burned, destroyed and melted with the <i>corpus solis</i>,
which Rogerius confirms is a complete and created world. This too is no
common fire, for common fire can neither burn nor destroy gold, but rather
it is a supernatural, indestructible fire, the strongest of all fires,
yes a hellish fire, the only one which has the power to burn gold, and
to free it from its hard and stiff bonds. You must understand and know
that this supernatural fire which has such power over gold and other metallic
bodies, this fire alone is the spiritual, sulphuric, fiery water of mercury
in which the corpus solis is melted and burned, and from this melted and
destroyed substance a new world is created and born, a new world which
is the heavenly Jerusalem, an eternal, purified, subtle, penetrating and
fixed body which can penetrate all other corpora. That is why Rogerius
says: It would be like a supernatural fire which will break, dissolve and
mix together all the elementa in the world, and then the new work will
be reborn from the broken, transitory work of the melted elements and will
become an eternal work. Thus has the Holy Trinity also shown us a supernatural
fire in the heavenly stone. My son, the philosophers have hidden this supernatural
fire in their books and have called it in parabolic speeches by innumerable
names. Some of their special names for it are <i>Balneum Mariae</i>, damp
horse dung, menstruum, urine, milk, blood, <i>aquam vitae</i>, and such
like. Bernhardus says of this fire: Make a vaporous and constant fire which
is not too powerful, but subtle, airy, clear and contained, indestructible,
all-penetrating and eternal. And he goes on to say more on the subject.
In truth, I have told you all about the wisdom of the fire, for this vaporous
fire can do everything. For this reason he also says that one must consider
his words about the fire often and deeply. A wise man will soon deduce
that he must not take these words to mean a common fire, but rather a supernatural
fire. Maria Prophetessa also indicates that the element of water melts
the corpora and turns them white. Raymundus Lullius writes on the subject
of this fire (which he calls menstrum) and its preparation in his ‘<i>Testamento
noviss. in codice, in Anima metallorum, Luce Mercuriorum</i>’ and in ‘<i>Libro
mercuriorum</i>’ in the book ‘<i>De Secretis Naturae f. de Q. Essentia</i>’
and in the ‘<i>Eluciderio Testamenti</i>’ ch. 4, he says that it is not
human, but rather angelic to reveal this heavenly fire, and that to know
this is to know the greatest secret of all. He also says, in figurative
expressions, that this fire of the wise is composed of horse dung and live
calcium, I will explain what is represented by the live calcium elsewhere.
I have already explained what is meant by the horse dung, namely that the
horse dung is the water <i>prima materia</i>, for that too is warm and
damp, just like horse dung, but it is no ordinary horse dung, as many ignorant
people think. This is why the philosopher Alanus says: the philosophers
have called the damp fire horse dung, in whose dampness the hidden warmth
is contained, for it is a characteristic of the fire in a horse’s stomach
that it does not destroy the gold, but rather increases it for the sake
of its dampness. Alchidonius says: Our medicine is to be hidden in the
damp horse dung which is the fire of the wise. Alanus speaks in a similar
way. Dear son, take great care with the decomposition or disintegration.
The decomposition must occur in a gentle warmth, that is, in a damp horse
dung. Similarly, Arnoldus de Villa Nova writes in the ninth chapter that
the heat of horse dung should be in the fire. Alphidius too says: It must
be cooked and buried in the heat of horse dung, Aristotle too: The earth
or the corpus will gain no power unless it is sublimated in horse dung.
For this reason Hermes says: cook and bake it in the warmth of a horse’s
stomach; and Morienus: if you do not find what you are looking for in the
horse dung, then you can count your losses. Arnoldus agrees: You must search
for no other fire than this, for this is the fire of the wise, the melting
oven of the wise, their calcinating, sublimating, reverberating, dissolving,
coagulating and figuring oven, for this water can dissolve and calcinate
all metals and melts red and white with them. The ‘<i>Turba</i>’ and ‘<i>Senior</i>’
also speak of this: Our water is a fire and our water is stronger than
all fires, for it makes a pure spirit from the <i>corpore</i> of gold which
a natural fire cannot do, although natural fire also has something to do
with it. For our fire enters into an earth or powder so that the gold burns
more greatly than natural fire. Calid too says: In truth, it is a fire
which burns and grinds all things.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how this philosophical water or fire, which is
<i>aqua
mercurii</i>, is prepared has been hidden by the philosophers, as Raymundus
Lullus writes mysteriously in his works. It is first necessary for the
mercury to be purified of its outer dampness and earthliness, but this
must not be done with harmful and destructive things which would destroy
its noble, fruitful, green and fertile nature. Avicenna, Arnoldus, Geber,
Raymundus in codicillo and other philosophers state that mercury is best
purified through the sublimation of commonly prepared salt. The sublimate
is dried and mixed with Sal Tartari, is ground per retortam, then cut up.
This must be done several times. In this way the <i>mercurius</i> will
be rid of its outer dampness and foecibus. This purgation, says Bernhardus
at the end of his epistle, does not harm the <i>mercurius</i> because the
hot water and the salt do not penetrate it. But you must understand my
son, that while the <i>mercurius</i> is a uniform and inseparable substance
and essence, we cannot completely purify its outer whiteness, for its earthy
impurity lies hidden in its innermost depths and it cannot be separated
from it by any method of sublimation, how ever many ignorant people have
the audacity to suggest this. For this reason the following method must
be used. The <i>mercurium vivum purgatum</i> must be freed from the bonds
with which Nature ties it so securely to the earth. These bonds must be
loosed and it must be returned to its very first essence, namely a sulphuric,
spiritual water, without the addition of any foreign bodies in the world,
as Rogerius Bacon testifies to under the title ‘<i>De Mercurio</i>’, and
as Raymundus also says in the ‘<i>Theorica</i>’ of his testament: Unless
it is putrified in this way and dissolved, the menstruum will not be worth
a fig. But when the living mercury, purified of all foreign bodies, has
been freed of its bonds, and returned to its original water, then we can
purify it inwardly and separate the <i>spiritum</i> from the water and
its earthliness by distillation. The philosophers have spoken in secret
words about the separation, in a way that a hard-headed man would not easily
understand. They have written of it mysteriously and in a figurative manner
in their description of the distillation of wine that the spirit of wine
is mixed with a great deal of water and worldy earthiness. But the dry
<i>spiritum</i>,
or spirit of wine, can be separated from all phlegmatic moisture and worldy
earthliness by artificial distillation. In other words, the whole <i>spiritum</i>
is separated from the water o the wine, and the water from the earth. And
so the yeast, through whose calcinations its own white salt is extracted,
remains. This is married again with the spiritu and distilled again several
times until all the sal nitri has then gone into the lid of the distilling
vessel with the <i>spiritu</i>. In this way the power of the <i>spiritus</i>
is greatly strengthened and heightened by the sal. Truly, the philosophers
have given us a remarkable figurative description, which we should also
follow in the description of the water of mercury.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For when the latter has been dissolved, we should
do exactly as was done to the wine: By the sublimation of the water (or
phlegma) from the <i>spiritu</i>, the <i>spiritum</i> is separated from
the earth, the earth is rectified and married again to the <i>spiritu</i>,
and they are distilled again and again until both substances are to be
found in the lid of the distilling vessel. Of all the philosophers, none
has written better and more clearly on this subject than Raymundus Lullius,
in his ‘<i>Testamento Novissimo</i>’ and also in his first testament ‘<i>In
Libro Mercuriorum, libro Q. Essentia</i>’ in which he explains clearly
and at length that after the putrefaction, separation and distillation
of the philosophical spirit of wine, the spiritual water is mixed and distilled
again with its earth, and they are both put over the alembic together.
He also explains that this philosophical wine or mentruum is heightened
and strengthened with its own salt. And also you must also understand that
this water, menstruum or philosophical spirit of wine dissolves its own
corpus or living <i>mercurium</i> into the original essence or water, and
is then multiplied ceaselessly through the putrefaction and the distillation.
What is said of the extract of this water is confirmed by Arnoldus de Villa
Nova when he says: It is a substance full of foul smelling vapours and
which contains a gross moisture. From this substance the artist separates
the philosophical moisture which is easy to work with and which is as clear
as tears. The <i>Q. Essentia</i> lives in is metallic form in this substance.
It causes no discomfort to the metals, and the tincture of the whole metal
can be gathered in it. For it contains Nature’s <i>Argenti Vivi</i>, and
the nature of <i>sulphuris</i>. On the subject of the distillation of this
menstruum or water ‘<i>Rosarius Philosophorum</i>’ says that you should
take great care that the dishes in which you wish to purify your spirit
are made of glass, so that the spirit can find no place to escape through,
for it often slips quickly through the holes in dishes. And once the red
spirit has escaped all the artist’s work is in vain. The red spirit is
what the philosophers call blood and menstruum. So take care with your
dishes and with any cracks in your dishes, so that you can catch the dry
spirit with its blood in a receptable, without letting its power escape.
Store it carefully until you begin to work on it. But seeing the distillation
is more important than reading about it, and none can become a Master without
having first been a pupil. For this reason take great care over your work.
Using a receptacle distill the element at first over a gentle fire, and
when it has been distilled off, put it aside and replace it with another
receptacle. Make sure all the cracks are tightly sealed so that the spirit
cannot escape. Make the fire a little stronger. A dry yellow <i>spiritus</i>
will rise into the lid of the distilling vessel. Keep the fire burning
steadily for as long as the spirit is yellow. Then, when the alembic begins
to turn red, make the fire a little stronger, and keep it at this temperature
until the red spirit and the blood have been completely distilled off and
are floating in the lid of the distilling vessel like clouds in the sky.
As soon as the red spirit is distilled off, the lid will turn white. Stop
as soon as this happens. You now have the two elements air and water in
the receptacle, and you have separated the right matter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you will see, you now have the <i>primam materiam
metallorum</i> in which corpora can be reduced. For all metals have their
origin in water, and water is the root of all metals. That is why they
are reduced to water, just as frozen ice becomes water again in the warmth,
for it used to be water, before it was frozen. So do not be surprised,
for all things on the earth are like this, they all have their origins
in water. Oh there are so many of them! But you must not think about their
origins. You must work on. This is the key to the whole work, the key which
dissolves the corpora at the beginning, it is father and mother, it opens
and locks them, and reduces them to that which they were in the beginning.
It dissolves the corpora and coagulates with them, the spirit is led to
the water, that is, the power of the spirit is seen there taking effect,
and this happens when the corpus is placed in the water. On this subject
the philosopher says: There is something which everyone recognizes, and
whoever does not recognize it will rarely, perhaps never find it. The wise
man will keep it and the fool will throw it away, and the reduction comes
easily to the man who knows it. But, my son, the greatest secret of all
is how to free the stone or <i>mercurium vivum</i> from the natural bonds
with which it is bound to the laws of Nature, that is, how to dissolve
it and return it to its original water. For if this did not happen, all
our work would be in vain, for we could not separate and extract the true
spirit or liquid essence which dissolves all <i>corpora</i>. And all the
philosophers have kept this dissolution secret, and God the Almighty in
His Power has ordered them to do this, and they have cursed and damned
the men who have revealed it. For this reason they have spoken only briefly
and subtly of the return of this raw body to its original essence, so that
it can remain hidden to the ignorant. But you, my son, must understand
that this dissolving of the living <i>mercurii</i> to its original state
is difficult without knowledge of certain methods, but no sophistic methods
can be used, as are used by many coarse ignorant and unknowing fools, who
change the <i>mercurium</i> into water using many marvelous arts and believe
that it is the true water. They sublimate the <i>mercurium</i> by <i>corrosiva</i>
with all sorts of salts and vitriols, whereby the sublimated <i>mercurius</i>
draws the spirit of the salts into itself. Then they dissolve the sublimate
in water in Balneo or in the cellar or in various other ways. Then they
turn it into water using salmiac and herbs, salves or <i>aqua fort</i>,
using peculiar apparatus and many sophistic rules, but all of this is mere
fantasy, nonsense, useless and in vain. Some of them also think that they
can separate certain things from the water of mercury and that it will
become the true water which the philosophers desire. The reason for this
is simply that they do not heed the words of the philosophers which say
quite clearly that it should be mixed with no foreign object on earth.
And Bernhardus says in his ‘<i>Epistle</i>’: As soon as the <i>mercurius</i>
has been dried out by the salts, alum and <i>aqua fort</i>, it will no
longer dissolve. But take note, my dear son, of what I am about to tell
you, and of how the philosophers have left an account for those who understand
their books, namely, that this water cannot be prepared using strange methods
in the world, but rather, it can only be prepared using natural means;
together with Nature and from nature. These words are bright and clear
to those who understand, so this time I will not explain it openly, but
I will write it down in a special little tract, but as a memorial I will
add here the following verses:
<p>Take one that is fresh, pure, living, white and clear,
<br>Tie its hands and feet well
<br>With the strongest rope you can find
<br>So that it dries and is choked
<br>In the House of Putrefaction,
<br>As Nature has shown us.
<br>By this same harmonious Nature
<br>It will be dissolved and it will rise to the original essence.
<br>It is a living, spiritual spring
<br>Which flows clearly and brightly from Heaven.
<br>It eats its own flesh and blood
<br>In order to multiply.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever succeeds, with God’s help, in attaining this
blessed water should thank God, for he has in his hands the key which will
open the closed locks of all metal chests, and can take gold, silver, precious
stones, honour, power and good health. This blessed water is called the
daughter of Pluto by the philosophers, it has strength and power over all
reassures. It is also called the white, pure, tender and unspoiled maid
of Beja and without it no birth or blending can occur. For this reason
the philosophers have married this tender and pure maid to Gabrico, so
that they bear fruit, and when she was joined with Gabricus, he died. Beja
swallowed and consumed him in her great love, as Arisleus tells in his
‘<i>Practica</i>’: The spring or Fontina is like a mother to the king,
for she draws him to her and kills him. But through her the king is resurrected
again and he joins himself fast to her, so that no man can harm him. This
is why the philosopher says that Gabricus is more precious and worthy and
dear to the world than Beja, but he can bear no fruit alone. The philosophers
have called this maid and blessed water by many thousands of different
names in their books. They call it heaven, a heavenly water, a heavenly
rain, a heavenly thaw, a May thaw, water of Paradise, an aqua fortis and
an <i>aquam Regis</i>, a corrosive aquafort, a sharp vinegar and liquor,
also <i>Quintam essentiam vini</i>, a waxy green juice, waxy <i>mercurium</i>,
green water and <i>Leonem viridis</i>, quicksilver, menstruum or blood.
They also call it urine and horse piss, milk and virgin’s milk, water of
arsenic, silver, Luna or Lunae water, woman, a female seed, a sulphuric
steam and smoke, a fiery, burning spirit, a deathly all-penetrating poison,
a dragon, a scorpion which eats its young, a hellish fire of horse dung,
a sharp salt, sal armoniacum, a common salt, a lye, a viscous oil, the
stomach of an ostrich which eats and digests all things, an eagle, a vulture
and hermetic bird, a vessel and <i>Sigillum Hermetis</i>, a melting and
calcinating oven, and innumerable other names of animals, birds, plants,
waters, juices, milks and blood, etc. They have used all these names and
written of it figuratively in their books. They have suggested that such
a water is made of these things, with the result that all ignorant people
who have searched for it in these things, have not found the desired water.
You must also know, my son, that it can be made only from <i>mercurio vivo</i>
and from no other thing on earth, and the philosophers have given it so
many names that ignorant people cannot recognize it. And with that, I end
this little tract, written in order that you might understand and learn
that without this fire, all work in the world is in vain, all chemical
processes are a lie, useless and false. The great ‘<i>Rosarius</i>’ says
that there is no more than one recipe, and with this one lock all the books
of the philosophers a re locked, just as if they were surrounded by a strong
wall, and unless you know of, or have the key in your hands, you will never
open the lock, or achieve anything fruitful. For the only key to the metal
walls and gardens is this water. And this water is the strong aquafort
which Isaacus refers to in his own work. He dissolves the corpora with
it and uses it to make it spiritual. So note carefully that without this
water all is false, all is a lie, in metals and minerals as well as vegetalibus
and animalibus. You can dissolve, sublimate, distill, calcinate, extract,
mix and compose what you will, you can dissolve it in the cellar, in Balneo,
in dung, in aqua fortis and in any amount of strong waters which the alchemical
processes teach, or which you can think up yourself, you can make oil or
water or chalk or powder black, white, yellow and red. You can burn it,
pour it in any way and teach the alchemical recipes, you can claim that
you can make gold and silver with them. But it is all false, a stinking
lie from beginning to end (without the water). For I myself --- with my
own hands, or I should never have believed it --- I myself have learned
this through error and misfortune. Be warned, my son, protect yourself
from such sophists in Alchemy and the bragging of all deceitful people,
just as you would protect yourself from the tiresome devil and from a terrible,
impure and burning fire or poison. For through the sophistry of such cunning
and false alchemy a man can bring about the death of his body and soul,
his honour and goodness. Such deceit is truly more evil than the devil
himself, even if one were to turn a whole principality against such people,
everything would still be destroyed and still the lasting truth would not
