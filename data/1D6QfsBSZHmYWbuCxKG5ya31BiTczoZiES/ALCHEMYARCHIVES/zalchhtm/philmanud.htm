<p><b><font size=+1><i>Of the </i>Philosophical Stone<i>, and the </i>Secret<i>
thereof.</i></font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Stone</i> of <i>Philosophers</i> is a certain
<i>Coelestial
Substance</i>, Spiritual, fixt, Perfecting all <i>Metals</i> into true
<i>Gold</i>
and <i>Silver</i>, (according to the quality of the Medicine) exposed to
all Tryals and that according to the <i>Imitation</i> of <i>Nature</i>
and its <i>Operations</i>, as near as it can be done.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this <i>Substance</i> the <i>Art of Chymistry</i>
is conversant, which handleth and teacheth the means and way of doing it,
but not by diverse things, but by one thing alone it is done, to which
nothing is to be added; nothing taken away but only the <i>superfluities</i>
removed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that which appertains to the <i>Authority</i>
of this <i>Art</i>, Experience in this thing would be of much value to
Convince men: For if it could be proved, that <i>true Gold</i> was made
thereby, then indeed it would not be doubted both concerning the <i>truth</i>
and <i>benefit</i> thereof. But it is plain that <i>imperfect Metals</i>
are <i>Transmutable</i> after this manner, because all in general have
been <i>Destinated</i> to perfection, but some have remained <i>Imperfect</i>
for want of <i>Digestion</i>. Therefore if they can be duly <i>Cocted</i>
would also be <i>perfect</i>, and seeing nothing hinders in the <i>Marvel</i>,
but <i>this</i> may be done, because out of one <i>Fountain</i> all <i>Metals</i>
have proceeded, to wit, <i>Crude Mercury</i>, Cold and Moist, in which
there hath been no <i>difference</i> between <i>Sol</i> and <i>Saturn</i>,
but only what <i>Nature</i> works afterwards in this <i>Matter</i>, to
wit, <i>Decocting</i> it more or less, this alone hath made the <i>Diversity</i>.
Therefore all other <i>Metals</i> may be <i>perfected</i> into <i>Sol</i>
to wit, by the help of our <i>Divine</i> and most <i>perfect Magistery</i>,
which being projected upon <i>imperfect Metals</i>, is able so far to <i>perfect</i>
them, by <i>Decocting</i>, as it is of a more then due perfection required
in <i>Gold</i>. Here therefore we may observe of how great Virtue and spiritual
a Nature this our <i>Divine Stone</i> is, which can perfect that in one
hour above the Earth, by a bare <i>Projection</i>, which <i>Nature</i>
could not have Perfected by <i>Subterranean</i> Operations. Therefore it
is manifest here, what <i>Nature</i> helped by <i>Art</i> can do. For that
our <i>Stone</i> as it was <i>perfected</i> by <i>Nature</i> without the
help of <i>Art</i>, was only of <i>Unary Virtue</i>, but the Virtue which
is acquired by <i>Art, Nature Co-operating</i> and <i>assisting</i> is
<i>Denary</i>,
in every <i>Regimen</i>, that is, after a manner infinite, for it cannot
be computed, for that first by dissolving it, and again <i>Coagulating</i>
and <i>Decocting</i> it, one part of the <i>Medicine</i> falls upon a Thousand
of imperfect <i>Metals</i>, penetrating and perfectly <i>Tinging</i> it:
But id the <i>Dissolution</i> and <i>Coagulation</i>, being <i>Iterated</i>,
thou shalt try to promote this Medicine further, behold it is Extended
<i>in
infinitum</i>: For you shall sooner want wit to compute, then the
<i>Elixir
Virtue</i> to <i>penetrate</i> and <i>tinge</i>: Not that immediately by
its Corporeal Touch, it <i>tinges</i> the whole, but by its Virtue and
Influence, passes through the whole, since the least particle of the <i>Imperfect
Body</i> is touched and tinged immediately by the <i>Medicine</i>. But
the Matter is so, every part is <i>tinged</i> by the <i>contiguous</i>
part, like <i>Leaven</i>. Therefore the <i>Elixir tinges</i> that which
it touches more immediately, with a <i>Tincture</i> a little more feeble
then it was it self, this again <i>ferments</i> that which is nearest it,
by Communicating the <i>Tincture</i>, and that so long until the whole
<i>Mass</i>
be brought to the Perfection of true <i>Gold</i>. But this is done in a
short space of time, because of the Spirituality of our <i>Agent</i>, which
being a true <i>Metallick Fire</i>, like that Elementary one, does
<i>Imperceptibly</i>
warm and <i>penetrate</i> the hardest <i>Bodies</i>, even those parts which
were not touched by the <i>Coals</i>; and so this doth penetrate with its
virtue <i>Metals</i>, being resolved by that <i>Fire</i> and <i>fused</i>,
in a moment: So it hath often times been observed , that
<i>Dough</i> is
<i>fermented</i>
by the <i>ferment</i>, even that outward part, which the
<i>Corporeal</i>
part of the <i>Ferment</i> never touched: just so it is done in this Work;
observe therefore how Natural this <i>Progress</i> is in this Work. For
we do not Profess to Create <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i> (as some Reproachers
falsely Object) by our Art, but out of those things we say only in which
these are by Nature, to wit, out of <i>Metals</i>, which are of the same
Matter with <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>, but of an inequal <i>Digestion</i>,
and therefore remain imperfect, which by the
<i>Projection</i> of our <i>Arcanum</i>
upon them, we <i>Digest</i> and
<i>Perfect</i> after this manner, since
nothing else is required to <i>Perfect</i> them, besides this simple <i>Decoction</i>
of their <i>Crudity</i>, which our <i>Medicine</i> can abundantly perform.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ho therefore you Sons of <i>Learning</i>! Attend
to me! Because I will make known to you the whole Secret of our <i>Stone</i>,
which is not a <i>Stone</i>, and it is in every Man, and may be found in
its own Place at all times. If you have this you have the most precious
thing in the whole World. But it is <i>Divine</i>, and therefore not to
be Communicated to all. But to you Sons of <i>Learning</i>, I will manifest
the whole thing, neither will I conceal any thing necessary to this magistery.
But be present with attentive Minds and perceive my words, and lay them
up in your secret <i>Breasts</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have heard before, <i>The possibility of Transmutation</i>,
to wit, that a thing destined to Perfection, but being lefts Imperfect,
through defect of <i>Decoction</i>, may by the Application of an <i>Agent</i>,
of the same <i>Essence</i> and <i>Nature</i> with the Perfect, but of greater
Digestion, be perfected (to which these Imperfect were Destinated) and
matured, in as much as the <i>Agent</i> is of a more <i>Exuberant</i> maturity,
and more then perfect virtue. But our <i>Stone</i> is such to all other
imperfect <i>Metals</i>, whence we conclude without Controversie, that
these are <i>Transmutable</i>, thereby into <i>Gold </i>and <i>Silver</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider therefore you <i>Lovers of Wisdom</i>, what
and of what kind, that ought to be, which can perform this, which by the
<i>Philosophers</i>
is called a <i>Stone</i>, but it is in every Man, and in every thing, and
at every time of the Year to be found in its place.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe my words! Note the Mystery! Because it will
most certainly Consist of the <i>Elements</i>, then which nothing is more
Universal, and those not simply, but <i>Compounded</i> and <i>Anatized</i>,
that is, every <i>Element </i>being to be known by its Quality: Therefore
in every thing is our <i>Stone</i>, or everything, or rather out of every
thing, that is, <i>Element</i>, for any one of them, being destroyed, the
<i>Aureity</i>
perisheth. Be not therefore Solicitous concerning any thing Combustible
by the Fire, for certainly that which is made out of everything, that is,
Contains the virtue or Qualities of every <i>Element Anatized</i>, resisteth
the <i>Violence </i>of the <i>Fire</i> without danger.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearken therefore you Sons of <i>Learning</i>! Behold
I make known to you, the greatest <i>Mystery</i>! And God help you to conceal
this <i>Arcanum</i> from all unworthy Persons. Our <i>Stone</i> does not
draw its Original elsewhere then from <i>Metals</i>, and those most perfect:
But ye shall suffer <i>Common Operators</i> in this Art, to seek it all
things Extraneous; but as many of you are Lovers of <i>Truth</i>, don’t
attempt to find it out elsewhere then in <i>Metals</i>: For this is our
one, nay only true <i>Principle</i>. But what that is, it will be your
part to Observe; neither to induce any <i>Heterogeneous</i> thing into
this <i>Work</i>, but to leave that to others, which seek our <i>Stone</i>
in such things, but they shall always Labour, as long as they shall be
Ignorant, what our only true <i>Principle</i> is.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do make known this to you, remember therefore,
that a <i>Lyon</i> is Generated of a <i>Lyon</i>, a <i>Man</i> of a <i>Man</i>,
but to expect the Generation of these from other things, it would be absurd
and Ridiculous: <i>Combustibles</i> are produced even as <i>Combustibles</i>,
<i>Incorruptibles</i>
as <i>Incorruptibles</i>. Do you expect to gather
<i>Grapes</i> from <i>Thistles</i>,
or <i>Roses</i> from <i>Thorns</i>: It would be so absurd, if any should
do about to make our <i>Stone</i> out of <i>Animals, Herbs</i> or such
like things, as though the <i>Principle</i> of <i>Gold making</i> were
elsewhere to be sought then in <i>Gold</i>: Therefore our <i>stone</i>
is not to be sought in such things, which ought to have the <i>Natural
Proprieties</i> of <i>true Gold</i>, which are not in such like things,
neither to be found in them, except we be able to Create <i>Sperms</i>,
which is in the Power of no Man, but is proper to
<i>God alone</i>; and
if any one should premise himself to enact this, he would be <i>false</i>
and a <i>Lyar</i>. Therefore let it suffice us, to <i>dispose</i> and <i>administer
Sperms</i> which are ready to our Hands, but it is not to the Matter, that
new ones should be Created from <i>Heterogeneous things</i>, which is both
impossible to be done, and if it should be done, these <i>Artificial Sperms</i>
would be of no more virtue then those Natural Ones, which Nature has fitted
to our <i>Work</i>; therefore we must in no wise believe him that <i>professes</i>
to produce the <i>Seed of Metals</i>, out of <i>Vegetables</i>, &amp;c.
For although he take to himself the Title of a <i>Wonderful Philosopher</i>
and a <i>skillful Artist</i>, with the ignorant sort, yet whilst he knows
not to use Created things, it is much less probable that he can <i>Create
Sperms</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whosoever therefore will be a <i>Son of Art</i>,
let him learn and acknowledge that our <i>Stone</i>, the <i>Transmutor
of Metals </i>into a perfect <i>Species</i>, is nearly included, and contained
in the most <i>perfect Metals</i>: Out of these therefore let him be admonished
to Learn its <i>Production</i> and not elsewhere.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now therefore, if I be not deceived, you have heard
plainly enough, whence the <i>Matter</i> of this <i>Secret Stone</i> is
to be sought: And if you have well observed, it will not happen that you
should err in this thing: Now let us say something of its <i>Name</i>,
for it is explained how it is in every Man and Place. Now I will teach
how, and why it is called a <i>Stone</i> and not a <i>Stone</i>: Lastly
I will adumbrate how it is to be <i>Found</i>. For the <i>Philosophers</i>
say that it is a <i>Stone</i>, and not a <i>Stone</i>, which some understand
ill; but the <i>Vulgar</i> for the most part, but it is Interpreted according
to the letter, to be something, but what they are Ignorant, to be like
a <i>Stone, tinging</i> everything, even by the very touch, into <i>pure
Gold</i>, whether it shall be <i>Wood</i> or <i>Stone</i>, which they repute
for false (and deservedly) therefore they judge it impossible to every
<i>Art</i>
(except Diabolical:) Therefore the name of a <i>Chymist</i> being heard,
they presently abhor and detest him, nor look upon him any other than a
<i>Foolish
Waster</i> of his <i>Estate</i>, being incited to this, by the false and
confused Understanding of our most <i>secret</i> Stone; therefore, the
more Ignorant Men do superstitiously believe, that such Men are to be Punished
by the <i>Civil Law</i>: But under the Name of <i>Ignorant Men</i>, I do
not only mean those that are <i>Plebeians</i>, or <i>Illiterate</i>, and
<i>unlearned</i>,
but also I mean some, nay many men otherwise Learned, and perhaps Pious,
whom I therefore name Ignorant and unskillful in this Art; and also that
they indued with such Rude Manners, to bark at everything unknown, like
<i>Dogs</i>, and speak Evil of those things, which they neither, either
have or could conceive in their minds, my reproof Extends to them most,
because they being both <i>Learned</i> and <i>Pious</i>, do what is contrary
to <i>Piety</i> and <i>Learning</i>, to wit, Judge such things which they
neither do nor can discern. For when
<i>Learning</i> admonishes, Piety
Perswades that every one should Consider and Examine those things which
he judges; these on the other hand condemn it undoubtedly, which yet after
they have Condemned, they know not, and are ignorant what it is, which
is very unworthy every wise Man.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, others <i>studious</i> in the <i>Art</i>
of <i>Chymistry</i>, although they understand the thing a little more <i>Natural</i>,
yet in this they err, because they would make some <i>Stony Congealation</i>,
to wit, they would make something to bear the form of a <i>Stone</i>, for
this alledging the <i>words of Philosophers</i> which affirm it to be a
s<i>tone</i>. But I would have you to Understand, that it is not called
a Stone because it is like a stone, but for this Cause alone; that it flyes
not from the Fire, but remain fixed in it, like as it were a <i>stone</i>,
and for this it is called a <i>stone</i>, for the sake of hiding this <i>secret</i>,
but it is like a <i>stone</i> no otherways, and therefore it is not a <i>stone</i>;
but in <i>species</i> is <i>Gold</i> more pure than the purest, in <i>fixity</i>
or <i>incombustibility</i>, a <i>stone</i>, in <i>Figure</i> of most <i>subtile
Powder</i>, to sight a <i>grave Body</i>, to touch <i>impalpable</i>, to
taste <i>sweet</i>, of <i>good smell</i>, in virtue a most <i>penetrating
spirit</i>, being dry and yet <i>unctuous</i>, easily flowing upon a Plate
of <i>Metal</i> and <i>tinging</i>: Therefore it is deservedly called <i>the
Father of all wonderful things</i>, since it hath all the <i>Elements</i>
in it, yet so anatized, that none Predominates, yet all four make one fifth
<i>Essence</i>
or <i>Nature</i>, which is none of the four, but partakes of all, and is
a most temperate <i>Complexion</i>, tho it be <i>pure Metallick Fire</i>,
and this is our <i>stone</i>, which is not a <i>stone</i>, nor has any
Name proper to its self, and yet there is nothing in all the World whose
Name it may not have, under some Consideration, For that it is of so wonderful
a <i>Nature</i>, as if we call it <i>spiritual</i>, it is
<i>true</i>,
if <i>Corporeal</i> we speak <i>properly</i>: For it is <i>Gold</i>, and
that not <i>Vulgar</i> but <i>Spiritual</i>, that is <i>subtile, penetrative</i>
and <i>Noble</i>: wherefore it is a <i>spirit</i> or <i>fifth Essence</i>,
the most Noble of all <i>Creatures</i>, after the <i>Rational Soul</i>,
and bringing all <i>Distempers</i>, and all <i>Imperfections</i> both in
<i>Animals</i>
and <i>Metals</i> (according to the Quality of the <i>Medicine</i>) to
a most exact and perfect <i>temperature</i>: And that is truly our <i>Microcosme</i>,
which we esteem so much. Having this <i>Stone</i> or <i>Powder</i> or <i>fifth
Essence</i>, neither <i>Riches</i> nor <i>Health</i> will be wanting, God
giving, to whom be glory for Ever.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that I may come to the last part of my <i>undertaken
Task</i>, to wit, that I may show by what Means this our <i>Stone</i> may
be obtained, for it is not Fabricated by Nature, but it is to be sought,
and to be Composed by the <i>Art</i> and <i>Ingenuity</i> of the <i>Work-man</i>;
yet nature helping and seconding his Endeavor, for as it is abundantly
enough Declared, that the <i>Matter</i> of this <i>Stone</i> is not to
be fetched elsewhere then from <i>Metals</i>; Yet nevertheless these <i>Metals</i>
are not our <i>stone</i>, for they have Another form Different from our
stone. Notwithstanding, I do not deny that our Medicine, is to be drawn
from them, but the former form of the <i>Metal</i> must necessarily be
taken away, that it may be drawn out, and that under the Conservation of
the <i>Species</i>, tho under the Distruction of that particular and <i>Individual</i>
Metal. But the <i>Species</i> of <i>Metals</i> dwells, and is Conserved
in the <i>spirit</i>, which <i>spirit</i> resides not in any other thing,
but in Water <i>Homogeneous</i> of its own kind: For water is the <i>Habitation</i>
of the <i>Spirit</i>, which is especially to be retained in the <i>Conservation</i>
of its <i>species</i>. Therefore <i>Gold</i> is to be Changed from its
<i>Form</i>,
and that into Water <i>Homogenous</i> of its own kind, in which <i>Water</i>
the <i>Spirit</i> of the <i>Gold</i> is preserved, which afterwards, <i>Re-inspissates</i>
its <i>Water</i>, and Induces a new Form, after <i>Putrifaction</i>, a
thousand times more perfect then the form of Gold, which lost by being
<i>re-incrudated</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore <i>Metallick Bodies</i> are to be reduced
into <i>Homogeneal Water</i>, not <i>wetting the Hands</i>, that out of
this <i>Water</i> a new <i>Metallick Species</i> may result, for more <i>Noble</i>
than any <i>Metal</i>. This is our most <i>precious Medicine</i> and <i>Coelestial
Ruby</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all this Work, very well Answers to the <i>Subterraneal
Operation</i> of <i>Nature</i>, from whence the <i>Work</i> is deservedly
called <i>Natural</i>. For Nature doth produce <i>Metals</i>, according
to their species, out of <i>Mercury</i> alone, <i>Cold</i> and <i>moist</i>,
by a daily <i>Digestion &amp; Coction</i> in the Veins of the <i>Earth</i>.
But <i>Art</i> to shorten the Work, hath found out a far more subtile Operation,
yet like to this: For it <i>Conjoyns</i> with <i>Crude Mercury</i>, <i>Cold</i>
and <i>moist</i>, ripe <i>Gold</i>, and both of these by <i>Commixtion</i>,
and <i>secret Conjunction</i>, makes one <i>Mercury</i>, which they name
<i>Aqua
Vitae</i>, which <i>Mercury</i> at last they Decoct into <i>Gold</i>, not
<i>Vulgar</i>,
but far more <i>Noble</i>: which falls upon all <i>Imperfect Metals</i>,
and <i>tinges</i> them into <i>tryed Gold</i>, exposed to all Tryals.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You understand, therefore, as I believe, that tho
our <i>Stone</i> be of <i>Gold</i> alone, yet it is not <i>Vulgar Gold</i>.
That therefore our <i>Gold</i> may be fetched from <i>Vulgar Gold</i>,
it is to be <i>Dissolved</i> into <i>Water</i>, not <i>Elementary</i>,
but not wetting the Hands, that it <i>Mineral</i>: which Water is <i>Mercury</i>,
which from a Red <i>Servant</i>, hath means in its self, to perfect the
whole <i>Work</i>, without any Imposition of Hands, and this at last is
that only, true and Natural <i>Principle</i>, to which nothing is to be
added, nothing taken away, unless some <i>Superfluities</i>, which without
any humane help, its self will <i>perfect</i>, by its own <i>Virtue</i>
and <i>Natural Instinct</i>. Therefore thou having this <i>Mercury</i>
mind nothing else. With good Reason therefore, the <i>Philosopher</i> said,
<i>Imply
thy whole study in Decocting Mercury</i>, but I say to thee, let thy whole
Study be <i>Imployed</i> in getting this <i>Mercury</i>, that is in <i>Dealbating</i>
our <i>Red Laton</i>, which being done, thou hast done thy Part, what remains
is the work of <i>Women</i> and the Play of
<i>Boys</i>: For <i>Nature</i>
will be present to dispatch the rest, but in the mean while, a desired
rest is given to thee, which indeed, as the
<i>Philosopher</i> said, <i>Is
more desirable than any Labour</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For know, that our <i>Albification</i> is no Light
<i>Work</i>,
being Radical, for this will be the <i>Indicium</i> of an
<i>Altered</i>
and <i>reduced Body</i>. Neither will <i>Gold</i> so <i>Albificated</i>,
ever return to its <i>Pristine form</i>; for from a <i>Body</i> is made
a Spirit, and from <i>fixt, Volatile</i>, by this Operation. Therefore
be wholly intent on <i>Dealbating Laton</i>, for it is easier to make <i>Gold</i>,
then so to destroy it, for he that <i>dissolves</i> so, <i>Congeals</i>
it rather, for the Solution of the <i>Body</i>, and the <i>Coagulation</i>
of the <i>Spirit</i>, are <i>Coincident</i> in it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Consider you <i>Sons</i> of <i>Wisdom</i>, and
Note these <i>Mysteries</i>: That which Dissolves is a <i>Spirit</i>, but
that which <i>Coagulates</i> is a <i>Body</i>. Therefore if you would Dissolve
your <i>Body</i>, first of all, you have need of a <i>Spiritual Substance</i>,
because a Body cannot <i>dissolutively</i> enter a <i>body</i>, But a <i>Spirit</i>
entreth it, <i>Attenuating</i> and <i>Rarifying</i>, and because you require
<i>Water</i>,
therefore you have need of <i>Water</i> to manifest this: for every <i>Agent</i>
Exercising any Act upon any thing, <i>Assimilates</i> that on which it
Acts to its self (as far as it can be done) and every Natural Effect is
conformed to the Nature of the <i>Efficient</i>, therefore to draw <i>Water</i>
out of the <i>Earth</i> you have need of <i>Water</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t mean (as some badly think) by <i>Water, Aquafortis,
Aqua Regis</i>, and other <i>Corrosives</i>, which Common <i>Alchymistes,
Artificially Compound</i> to themselves, and put them to dissolve these
<i>Metallick
Species</i> which yet they don’t Dissolve, but Corrode, foul and Corrupt:
for who would believe that those <i>Waters</i>, can Destroy the old form
of the <i>Metal</i>, under <i>Conservation</i> of a <i>Metallick Species</i>,
which yet themselves are <i>Aliens</i> from a <i>Metallick Nature</i>?
For they are not sufficient Enough to destroy thoroughly the
<i>Species</i>!
Else they would Convert them into their own Nature? But as far as they
can, they do Transform them into some sordid thing: for the more Bodies
are Corroded, the more they are Estranged from a <i>Metallick Nature</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our <i>Water</i> is <i>Water</i> of <i>Mercury</i>,
and dissolves Bodies into <i>Mercury</i>, and inseparably is joined with
them, being Dissolved, <i>Cohabitates</i> and is <i>Concocted</i>, that
from them may be made that one <i>All-Spiritual</i> thing which is sought.
For every thing that any thing <i>Naturally dissolves</i>, (that so the
<i>Species</i>
of the thing Dissolved may be preserved) remains with the thing Dissovled,
Materially and formally, and does <i>Coalesce</i>, and is <i>Inspissated</i>
by it, and nourishes it, as a <i>Body</i> may see in a <i>Grain of Wheat</i>,
which being Dissolved by a <i>terrene Humid Vapour</i>, this <i>Vapour</i>
remains with this Grain after <i>dissolution</i> for its <i>Radical Humidity</i>,
and <i>Coalesces</i> with it into a <i>Plant</i>. Another thing also will
be to be Observed in every <i>Natural Dissolution</i>, is the enlivening
of a Dead thing, can be done by nothing else then that
<i>Living thing</i>
which was of the Essence of the Dead thing before it was Dead: As in a
Grain the Life is dead as (I may say) which we would have vivified; this
can be done therefore by nothing else but the vapour of the Earth, the
<i>Humidity</i>
and <i>Calidity</i> of the <i>Air</i>, for that the Grain its self was
<i>Extracted</i> out of the Earth, and formerly was nothing else but such
like <i>vapour</i> which afterwards became dead by <i>Decoction</i>, therefore,
by this alone naturally to be Vivified, under the <i>Conservation</i> of
its <i>Species</i>. Therefore I write this, because so many and so learned
Men are so much Deceived with that Vulgar <i>Mercury</i>, for although
it is a <i>Mineral Water</i>, yet not of a like <i>Nature</i> or <i>Essence</i>
with <i>Gold</i>. For who will not confess, that if a Grain of <i>Wheat</i>,
be cast into a Pool of Water, it will not Germinate nor Increase (yet <i>Bull-Rushes</i>
are wont to <i>Vegetate</i> there) whence is this I pray? Except that the
<i>Aquacus</i>
humour was not essential to it, neither, of a like Nature with the <i>Wheat</i>;
wherefore it doth not Naturally Dissolve it, but Destroys it: Not otherways
Gold if it be mixed to be Decocted with Common thing: for the more Bodies
are Corroded, the more they are Estranged from a <i>Metallick Nature</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our <i>Water</i> is <i>Water</i> of <i>Mercury</i>,
and dissolves Bodies into <i>Mercury</i>, and inseparably is joined with
them, being Dissolved, <i>Cohabitates</i> and is <i>Concocted</i>, that
from them may be made that one <i>All-Spiritual</i> thing which is sought.
For every thing that any thing <i>Naturally dissolves</i>, (that so the
<i>Species</i>
of the thing Dissolved may be preserved) remains with the thing Dissolved,
Materially and formally, and does <i>Coalesce</i>, and is <i>Inspissated</i>
by it, and nourishes it, as a <i>Body</i> may see in a <i>Grain of Wheat</i>,
which being Dissolved by a <i>terrene Humid Vapour</i>, this <i>Vapour</i>
remains with this Grain after <i>dissolution</i> for its <i>Radical Humidity</i>,
and <i>Coalesces</i> with it into a <i>Plant</i>. Another thing also will
be to be Observed in every <i>Natural dissolution</i>, which since such
like Dissolution, is the <i>enlivening</i> of a Dead thing, can be done
by nothing else then that <i>Living thing</i> which was of the Essence
of the Dead thing before it was Dead; As in a Grain of Life is dead as
(I may say) which we would have vivified; this can be done therefore by
nothing else but the vapour of the Earth, the <i>Humidity</i> and <i>Calidity</i>
of the <i>Air</i>, for that the Grain its self was <i>Extracted</i> out
of the Earth, and formerly was nothing else but such like <i>vapour</i>
which afterwards became dead by <i>Decoction</i>, therefore, by this alone
naturally to be Vivified, under the <i>Conservation</i> of its <i>Species</i>.
Therefore I write this, because so many an so learned Men are so much Deceived
with that Vulgar <i>Mercury</i>, for although it is a <i>Mineral Water</i>,
yet not of a like <i>Nature</i> or <i>Essence</i> with <i>Gold</i>. For
who will not confess, that if a grain of <i>Wheat</i>, be cast into a Pool
of Water, it will not Germinate nor Increase (yet <i>Bull-Rushes</i> are
wont to <i>Vegetate</i> there) whence is this I pray? Except that the <i>Aquacus</i>
humour was not essential to it, neither of a like Nature with the <i>Wheat</i>;
wherefore it doth not Naturally Dissolve it, but Destroys it: Not otherways
Gold if it be mixed to be Decocted with Common <i>Quicksilver</i>, or any
other Mercury, Except alone of its own <i>Humidity</i>, it doth not receive
a Dissolution in them, to wit, because these Waters being too Crude, Cold
and unclean, are of a far unlike nature with <i>Gold</i>: wherefore in
these it is not amended, neither retained, neither with these Matured into
a far more Noble <i>Perfection</i>, then its Nature. Therefore at Length
our <i>Mercury</i> is not <i>vulgar Mercury</i>, for it a pure Water, Clean,
Clear, Bright and Resplendent, and worthy of much Admiration: It is red
with <i>Sol</i>, but in Respect of Common <i>Mercury</i> Digested, warm
and Mature, which has no qualitys like to this, except alone in whiteness
of Colour, and of its form of <i>Flux</i> in which notwithstanding there
is a great Difference.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But lastly that you may well understand what our
Water is, by Circumstances, I tell thee (and that moved with Charity) that
it is Living, Running, Clear, Shining, White like Snow, Hot and Moist,
Airy, Vaporous and Digesting, in which <i>Gold</i> is melted like <i>Ice</i>
in warm Water, in this is Contained the while Regimen of Fire and Sulphur
which Exist but Predominates not. This is indeed <i>the keeper of our Gates,
the Bath of the King and his Queen</i>, dayly Warming and that Incessantly,
and yet is taken elsewhere then from the Matter, and is distinguished from
the whitening <i>Substance</i> of the Water, yet joined and appearing,
under the same form of <i>Flux,</i> amd the same Colour. This is that heat
of the Lamp, which if it be Temperate, every day will Circumact the Matter,
(until by Calcination the Humidity being dryed a second Fire of Ashes is
produced, in which the Vessel or Water is <i>Hermetically</i> shut and
Sealed, according to the Saying of the <i>Philosopher, take a Vessel strick
it with a Sword, take its Life, this is the Closure</i>. Therefore this
our Water is our Vessel, and in that our <i>Furnace</i> dwells secretly,
whose Fire ought to be moderate, least the whole Work be destroyed, yet
strong enough least the Life Dispond for want of Heat. Therefore in this
Water the whole Secret of our Vessel consists, also the Structure of the
hidden <i>Furnace</i> is founded in the Composition of this Water, in the
Knowledge whereof, all our Fires, all our Weights, all our Regimens lie
hid. This Water is the Clear Bright Fountain in which our <i>King</i> is
to be washed, that he may overcome all his enemies, of this Water and its
Preparation be Careful, because surely without any other help except the
Apposition of a perfect purged and Cleansed Body, Nature will make from
hence our most Secret <i>Stone</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I say to thee in truth, that this Water is <i>Mineral</i>,
pure and Clean, neither can it be Extracted elsewhere, but out of these
things alone in which it is by Nature. And the things out of which it is
immediately Drawn, are most secret above all others. Also the means of
Extracting it is most wonderful; also its Virtues Stupendous. For it doth
Dissolve <i>Sol</i> without violence, and is made friendly to it, and it
washeth him from all his Foulness: It is White, warm and Clear; therefore
praised be the most High, who hath Created this <i>Mercury</i> and given
it a Nature overcoming all others. For certainly the Work of <i>Alchymy</i>
would be in vain and useless, without this Water. But consider thou what
this Water is, and Learn from the Work as I have done. For having this
<i>Mercury</i>
thou hast the Key of the whole <i>Art</i>, with which thou mayest unlock
all the most secret things of <i>Philosophers</i>. Therefore our Water
is of a like Nature with Gold, of an unlike Substance, in the making of
which there is a great Stink. Consider therefore and deeply weigh the possibility
of nature, and do not mix any <i>Heterogenous</i> thing: For Nature is
only amended by its own Nature, and by no other. But if you do not yet
understand do not blame me, for I have sincerely (as far as it is Lawful
for a Man to speak) Expounded to you the whole matter: That therefore you
may understand the Conclusion of the Matter, be very attentive. Our Stone
is made out of one thing, and four <i>Mercurial Substances</i> (whereof
one is mature, the rest Crude, but pure, of which two are drawn out of
a <i>Mineral</i> by the third, but wonderfully) joined with a Temperate,
not Violent <i>Fire</i>, and so <i>Cocted</i> every day, until all be made
one by a Natural Conjunction, most secret, not Manual.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards the <i>Fire</i> being changed, let it
be Digested with a <i>Fire</i> daily increasing, at first more Moderate,
and so every day increased until these <i>Volatiles</i> are fixed by a
<i>Sulphur</i>
of their own kind, fixt and incombustible, until the whole Compound possess
the same Nature, Fixity and Colour. For then it securely Resists the Fire,
and this is the most powerful Power of Power, overcoming every subtil and
penetrating every solid thing; the virtue of which being turned into earth
appears compleat.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are, that I may describe the thing particularly,
manifold Degrees of this our Process, in Number Twelve, all which I will
briefly run over, the first whereof is called <i>Calcination</i>.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>Of Calcination.</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>Calcination</i> is the first Purgation of
the <i>Stone</i>, the <i>Exsiccation</i>, of the <i>Humidity</i>, by the
virtue of the <i>Natural Heat</i> of our Water, stirred up by the External
Heat, from whence the Composition is turned into <i>Calx</i> or <i>Powder</i>
of a black colour, yet unctuous, and retaining the <i>Radical Humidity</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final Cause of this <i>Calcination</i> is, that
the <i>Solution</i> may be the better induced to the <i>Stone</i>, which
without this cannot be had: For <i>Gold</i> is a very fixt Body, neither
can it be immediately Dissolved by our Water, except only in part, that
is, be made soft, <i>Incrudated</i> and <i>Albificated</i>: In which <i>Albification</i>
two natures appear, <i>volatile</i> and <i>fixt</i>: which we like to two
<i>Dragons</i>,
or <i>Serpents</i>. Wherefore that a full Dissolution may be made, there
is need of Contrition, that the Body by Calcination may be made <i>spongious</i>
and <i>viscous</i>, because then at last it is fit for Dissolution.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Second final Cause is this, that we Reconcile
contrary Qualities, for whilst they fight, they are unprofitable unto us:
For in the first Conjunction our Water distinguishes between <i>Sulphur</i>
and <i>Mercury</i>, <i>volatile</i> and <i>fixt</i>, and these are Enemies
to one another, and Different things, but it is our part to bring them
to a Union, but contrary qualities are not reconciled, but by a Medium;
there are therefore in our first Operation, four contrary qualities, Heat,
Cold, Dryness, and Humidity, of which two, Hot and Dry, are Attributed
to <i>Sulphur</i>, Cold and Humid to <i>Mercury</i>, therefore they are
opposed Diametrically, the heat of <i>Sulphur</i> and the Cold of <i>Mercury</i>,
also the Humidity of <i>Mercury</i>, and Siccity of <i>Sulphur</i>: To
reduce these Contraries to friendship cannot be done without a Medium,
but the medium must be partaker of both, also suited to both. Would we
therefore reconcile Cold and Heat, the Medium will be by Siccity, which
may be joined to both heat and Cold; by turning therefore the Composition
into earth, heat and Cold agree in this third thing, that they may dwell
together, to wit the Degree being abated: But afterwards being dissolved
into water, also two other Enemies are Reconciled, Siccity and Humidity,
by the <i>Frigidity</i> of Water, so that now one is made of two by the
Conjunction, made after a Natural Separation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Efficient of this Calcination is, the operation
of heat upon Moisture, turning everything that resists it into most subtile
Powder, but the moving Instrument is the <i>Fire</i> contrary to nature,
which is hid in our dissolving Water, stirring up heat in the body, and
digesting the Humidity into a viscous and unctuous Powder.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that this Operation is prior to dissolution take
these Reasons; it is prior, because a certain Solution is made (as I may
so say) by our Divine water, therefore the congealation of our Spirit,
will be expected in the next place, because Spirits are always congealed
after the dissolution of the body: For they have the same Operation, such
therefore as the Solution is, such the Congealation is to be expected after
it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Order of <i>Nature</i> requires this, for
a Woman Exerciseth her Dominion first, then it is necessary to be overcome
by her Husband, but the Woman retains her whole Domination in the Water;
this therefore will be the first Work; this therefore will be the first
Work, of the Man Exerting his Power to overcome that, in which the Woman
possesseth both her Qualities, which being done, he will easily Subject
to himself that, in which she hath only one quality.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Heat is not Consequentially joined necessarily
to any Quality, but Siccity will always be the end of heat: from whence
it appears, that the man ought first to exert his power, therefore <i>Calcination</i>
is rightly called the beginning of the Work.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore <i>Calcination</i> is the head of the Work,
for without this, will neither be Commixtion or Union, this therefore is
to be done in the first days of thy <i>Stone</i>, for in the first Dealbation,
the Body is Reduced into its first Principles, <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i>,
of which the first is fixt, the other volatile, therefore are compared
to two <i>Serpents</i>, or <i>Dragons</i>, the one Winged, shewing its
Volatile Nature, the other without Wings, denoting fixity, both these coming
from one Fountain, tends to one thing, therefore is likened to a <i>Serpent</i>
taking his Tail in his Mouth, to shew that <i>Sulphur</i> is nothing without
the substance of <i>Mercury</i>, nor <i>Mercury</i> without the substance
of <i>Sulphur</i>, but that this <i>Mercurial Sulphur</i>, and <i>Sulphureous
Mercury</i>, perfect the whole Art. Therefore it is deservedly called one
Composition, that although it appears twofold in the beginning of the Work,
whence it is called <i>Rebis</i>, yet by Conjunction they may be made one
and the same, and this is called one <i>Elixir</i>, which never would be
possible unless they were quite of the same Nature. Therefore the nature
of <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i> are always congealed after the dissolution
of the Body: For they have the same Operation, such therefore as the Solution,
such the Congelation is to be expected after it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Order of <i>Nature</i> requires this, for
a Woman Exerciseth her Dominion first, then it is necessary to be overcome
by her Husband, but the woman retains her whole Domination in the Water;
this therefore will be the first Work, of the Man exerting his Power to
overcome that, in which the Woman possesseth both her Qualities, which
being done, he will easily Subject to himself that, in which she hath only
one quality.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, heat is not Consequentially joined necessarily
to any Quality, but Siccity will always be the end of Heat: from whence
it appears, that the man ought first to exert his power, therefore <i>Calcination</i>
is rightly called the beginning of the Work.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore <i>Calcination</i> is the head of the Work,
for without this, will neither be Commixtion or Union, this therefore is
to be done in the first days of thy <i>Stone</i>, for in the first Dealbation,
the Body is Reduced into its first Principles, <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i>,
of which the first is fixt, the other volatile, therefore are compared
to two <i>Serpents</i>, or <i>Dragons</i>, the one Winged, shewing its
Volatile Nature, the other without Wings, denoting fixity, both these coming
from one Fountain, tends to one thing, therefore is likened to a <i>Serpent</i>
taking his Tail in his Mouth, to shew that <i>Sulphur</i> is nothing without
the substance of <i>Sulphur</i>, but that this <i>Mercurial Sulphur</i>
and <i>Sulphureous Mercury</i>, perfect the whole Art. Therefore it is
deservedly called one Composition, that although it appears twofold in
the beginning of the Work, whence it is called <i>Rebis</i>, yet by Conjunction
they may be made one and the same, and this is called one <i>Elixir</i>,
which never would be possible unless they were quite of the same Nature.
Therefore the Nature of <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>Mercury</i> is diligently
to be Observed, and we must take care o Errours, for these two are not
contrary things, but one and the same <i>Sulphureal Mercury</i>, Mature
and digested, and <i>Mercurial Sulphur</i>, crude and Imature.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore that Divine kind of Generation, will be
necessary to be observed, to wit, how Nature has Operated in Procreating
<i>Metallick</i>
Bodies in the <i>Mines</i> under the earth, because we do all things in
our Work in Imitation thereof, as near as can be, therefore we use the
same Matter which she hath made use of, although Art has found out a far
more subtile way to the Abreviation of the Work, and the more then perfect
Exaltation of the Stone. For in <i>Metallick</i> Veins, one thing alone
is found, <i>viz. Mercury</i>, which is very crude and frigid, and in which
the <i>sulpureal</i> quality altogether is unactive, also no Digestive
heat is found there, but by an imperceptible Motion after a long time,
by little and little this <i>Metallick Principle</i> is changed, until
at last it be converted into fixt <i>Sulphur</i>: for that whilst it remained
Frigid and Humid, it was called <i>Mercury</i>, in this Eleration or Excitation,
it is named <i>Sulphur</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the matter is otherways in this our Work: For
besides <i>Mercury</i> Crude and Cold we have another thing, to wit, Mature
<i>Gold</i>,
in which Act, more active qualities Exist, this therefore we joyn to our
<i>Mercury</i>,
in which passive qualities are found, that the one may relieve the other,
and that which nature, helpt by no Heat hath digested in the <i>Mines</i>,
we having a double <i>Fire</i> Digest, whence it comes to pass that we
don’t make simply <i>Gold</i>, but some other thing much more Noble and
excellent then <i>Gold</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see therefore what <i>Sulphur</i> is, what <i>Mercury</i>;
how also we have a double <i>Sulphur</i> and a double <i>Mercury</i> in
our Art, which yet are not distinct in Essence, but in maturity and perfection;
also you understand, as I think, after what manner they are worked, since
the Perfect Body of <i>Gold</i> is Incrudated by our Divine water not wetting
the hands, and it is reduced to its first Principles, to wit <i>Mercury</i>,
which is not without Sulphur, participating of the Natures of the Luminaries,
therefore in this Operation the Woman Ascends upon the man, and predominates
over him for a Time, which indeed is unnatural, till the man begins to
exert his Power, and then first of all by his siccity-bringing heat, does
Exsiccate the Humidity of the Woman, by converting all into a most subtile
and viscous Powder, from which Powder by solution, water is afterwards
dissolved, in which Water is the spirit of the Dissolvent and dissolved,
the Man and the Woman are joyned together, But the excited <i>Heat</i>
doth not here find a Bound, but as yet Works every day by separation, by
distinguishing between the <i>subtile</i> and the <i>gross</i>, that the
first may swim at the Top, the latter may subside so long till all are
of the same quality, and then at length in the hour of their Nativity,
they are inseparably Conjoined, and the <i>Man</i> ascends upon the <i>Woman</i>
and Impregnates her: at length she brings forth the Cloud which she hath
<i>Conceived</i>,
in which she <i>Putrifies</i> and is <i>Corrupted</i>, and afterwards both
of them <i>ascend</i> or <i>arise</i> again <i>Glorious</i>; not now divided,
but made one and the same by <i>Conjunction</i>, and are so <i>Coagulated,
Sublimed, Cibated</i> and <i>Exalted</i>, into a most perfect nature and
<i>Multiplyed</i>
in weight and goodness of Quality, according to your Discretion; whose
excellent <i>Use</i> will be provided, as well in <i>Projection</i> as
in <i>Medicine</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore these <i>black</i> and <i>stinking Ashes</i>,
are not to be despised, since in them the <i>Diadem</i> of our <i>King</i>
is contained, and I tell you in all truth, that <i>whiteness</i> will never
be had unless you make it <i>black</i>, for unless the <i>Body putrifies</i>
it will remain without fruit, but if it be Corrupted then indeed thou shalt
see them arising from thence, where it seemed they had lost their <i>Bodies</i>
which they had, and they will appear that which they never were before.
Honour you therefore the <i>Sepulchre</i> of our <i>King</i>, for unless
you do this, you shall never admire him coming from the <i>East</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore you must take Care that you don’t err in
this first <i>Entrance</i>, for the Work is spoiled unless you be wary
here. The common Errors in this Operation are many and various; Firstly,
of them who know not what is to be Calcined, but seek the <i>Principle</i>
of <i>Goldmaking</i> in Extraneous things. Some bring in for their <i>Material
Principle</i>, those things which are not of the same Imposition with <i>Metals</i>,
such are <i>Borax, Alloms, Atrament, Vitriol, Arsnick, Seeds of Plants,
Wine, Vinegar, Urine, Hair, Blood, Gums</i>, and the <i>Rosins</i> of the
<i>Earth</i>;
some do endeavor, (such is their <i>Blockishness</i>) to Generate <i>Salts</i>
of every kind, out of the <i>Flame</i>, I pass by these understanding nothing
at all in this Art. Others, although they work in <i>Metals</i>, yet desire
to perfect <i>Calcination</i>, either with Corrosive <i>Waters, Spirit
of Salt, Sulphur</i> or <i>Fire</i>, and so indeed <i>Corrode</i> the <i>Bodies</i>,
not <i>Calcine</i> them. For this
<i>Calcination</i> is not made by a Native
<i>Calidity</i>,
of the Body, helpt by a Friendly heat, but by a <i>Corrosive</i> Force
of <i>Waters</i>, without any propensity of the <i>Metal</i> to it; therefore
<i>Metals</i> are <i>fouled</i> and <i>Dissipated</i>, and so Estranged
from a <i>Metallick</i> Nature, but not <i>Naturally Calcined</i>. Therefore
every <i>Calcination</i>, which is made elsewhere then in the perfect <i>Body</i>
of <i>Gold</i> is vain and unuseful to our work.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also every <i>Calcination</i> of <i>Sol</i>, in which
a <i>Dissolution</i>, without <i>laying on of Hands</i>, does not follow,
is false and vain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore this our <i>Calcination</i>, is necessarily
to be made by <i>Mercury</i>, which being joined to <i>Gold</i> (a due
<i>weight</i>
and <i>proportion</i> both of Quantity and Quality being observed) softens
it and takes away the Solidity and <i>Incrudates</i> it; and by its internal
heat, joined with the outward <i>Heat of Vulcan</i>, stirs up that Native
heat of the <i>Gold</i>, which being stirred up, acts upon the <i>Humidity</i>
and <i>Exsiccates</i> it into a subtile <i>Powder Viscous</i> and <i>Black</i>:
And this is the true <i>Key</i> of the <i>Work</i>, to <i>Incrudate</i>
the <i>Mature</i>, by the <i>Conjunction</i> of an
<i>Immature</i>, being
<i>incrudated</i>,
to <i>Calcine</i> it, being <i>Calcined</i> to <i>Dissolve</i> it, <i>Philosophically</i>
not <i>Vulgarly</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures of this our <i>Calcination</i> are these,
first, after the Body shall be <i>satiated</i> with <i>Water</i>, as soon
as the <i>Keeper of the Gates</i> shall stir up the <i>Heat</i> of the
<i>Bath</i>,
the <i>Water</i> begins to be Obscured, or that which was a <i>splendid
Composition</i> before, then it visibly grows <i>Turgid</i>, and swells,
ascending and descending continually, until the whole at last become a
<i>viscous</i>
and <i>fatt Powder</i>; in which it appears that the <i>Humidity</i> is
<i>conserved</i> in this <i>Operation</i>, otherwise the Labour would be
in vain. From thence therefore, it is easily resolved into Mineral <i>Water</i>,
which is the last and most certain Signe, that our <i>Calcination</i> has
been true and <i>Philosophical</i>. For as soon as the heat begins to Operate,
the Frigid and <i>Humid</i>, being Impatient thereof, goes to the top,
from thence it melts and descends, and so reduceth it, as much as may be,
to its own <i>Similitude</i>: Doing this daily until at last the whole
be resolved into Fat, and as it were <i>Glutinous Water</i>: For so our
<i>Operations</i>
are <i>Concatinated</i>, that one is the Cause and beginning of another,
neither can one be had or understood without another. But we, that we may
instruct the Sons of <i>Art</i> more fully, and drive away the unworthy,
as far as may be from this <i>Art</i>, do handle, as it were, divers Operations,
when there is but one <i>Recipe</i>, one <i>thing</i>, one <i>Regimen</i>
and <i>successive Disposition to black, white</i> and
<i>red</i>, neither
are we to be understood otherwise. Wherefore every one that will truly
be a <i>Philosopher</i>, should regard the <i>Sence</i>, not the <i>Letter</i>
of <i>Writers</i> in this <i>Art</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that we may come to our true <i>Calcination</i>,
these things are to be considered that follow.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Firstly</i>, that thou should get our <i>Mercury</i>,
without which, nothing is done in this <i>Art</i>: See then that thou be
not deceived in that Common <i>Mercury</i>, which is altogether unuseful
to our <i>Work</i>, for if thou Work in it to thy <i>Dying day</i>, thou
wil find nothing in it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, thou must take Care, that the <i>Fire</i>
of the <i>Furnace</i> be not too Intense, but let it be <i>clibanically</i>
measured, which that thou maist fully understand, know, that the <i>Sulphur</i>
which <i>Predominated</i> not in the <i>Mercury</i> or <i>Water</i> digests
the <i>Matter</i>, which together with <i>Azoth</i> is abundantly sufficient
for thee. Let not therefore, its Internal quality, confound the external
form, then be not <i>solicitous</i> about the <i>manner of making the Fire</i>,
only have a care that it be not too Gentle, for then thou wilt easily <i>dispond</i>
for want of Heat, nor yet let it be over Violent, but of a Moderate degree,
according to the Nature of the <i>Bodies</i>, and exclusive of Cold: Take
these things on the other Hand, concerning the Internal and Natural <i>Fire</i>,
I call that <i>Internal</i> which increaseth the Work in the End.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, be careful of the quantity, that
thou dost not put so much to be <i>drunk</i> by <i>Laton</i>, that he cannot
afterwards Eate, for if thou shall put on too much, there will be a Sea
of trouble, if too little, it will be burnt into <i>Smoak</i>; be not therefore
<i>Covetous</i>
or <i>Prodigal</i>, between the <i>Extreams</i>, keep a
<i>Mean</i>. Therefore,
in joining the <i>Male</i> with his <i>Female</i>, remember that it behoves
the Activity of <i>Sulphur</i>, to <i>Exsiccate</i> the superfluous <i>Humidity</i>
of <i>Mercury</i>, therefore do not drown the active with too much <i>Crude
Sperm</i>, the <i>Woman</i> will also desire to Rule, therefore do not
Choak the <i>Humidity</i> of thy Stone, with too much <i>Earth</i>, but
with Discretion mix it sweetly, and according to the <i>Exigence of Nature</i>,
lest the <i>Virtue</i> of the <i>Stone</i> be <i>diminished</i>; make therefore
an <i>Amalgama</i>, not as the <i>Goldsmith</i> does, with four or five
<i>Parts</i>
of <i>Water</i>, but as the <i>Philosophers</i> do, with a double or treble
to the last, but it is better, to take three to four, then one to two,
since the solution will be better, because the
<i>Calcination</i>, will
be more <i>Natural</i>. <i>Ripley</i> Witnesseth with me, ‘<i>That by how
much the more Earth</i> (says he) <i>and less Water thou take, so much
the better Solution shalt thou make</i>'. In the first place therefore,
beware that your Land be not overwhelmed with waters, because the <i>Fire</i>
is hidden in the <i>Earth</i>, which will not Operate if there be too much
<i>Humid
Superfluity</i>: whence the Error will be
<i>Incorrigible</i>, and the
work vain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fourthly</i>, Be careful of the <i>closure</i>
of the <i>Vessel</i>, left the <i>Spirits</i> should fly out and the <i>Work</i>
be destroyed. Keep therefore the <i>Vessel</i> and its <i>Ligature</i>,
nor look upon this to be of little moment. Consider therefore Man, who
as he is <i>Generated</i> by <i>Nature</i>, so also our <i>Gold</i> is
Matured by <i>Art</i> helped by <i>Nature</i>: Therefore consider with
how great care, Nature has shut the <i>Womb</i> of a <i>pregnant woman</i>,
lest anything should either get in, or pass out; otherwise the <i>Foetus</i>
would perish. With no less Industry be thou cautious in <i>perfecting</i>
this <i>Philosophical work</i>, lest thy Labour be in vain. Hear therefore
the <i>Philosopher</i>, saying, '<i>Take a vessel and Fire, strike it with
a Sword, take the Life, this is the Closure'</i>: Hermes also says, ‘<i>The
Vessel of the Philosophers is their water, and know for certain, that the
vessel of nature is only fit for us in this Art, which diligently is to
be shut'</i>. For in forming the <i>Embrio</i>, there are very great winds,
which if they should vanish, we are undone; for the error is <i>irreparable</i>,
whence the Damage is most certain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Work in the <i>Fifth</i> place is <i>Patience</i>,
that thou don’t dispond or study to make the <i>Solution</i> too speedy,
but firmly believe, that too much bast is the greatest <i>Enemy</i> to
<i>Conjunction</i>,
and hinders it: For the Body to be <i>dissolved</i>, Impertinently <i>Rubifies</i>,
stirring up a Feaver, that is, a <i>Fire</i> against <i>Nature</i>, whence
being struck as it were with the <i>Hammer of Death</i>, it becomes impertinently
passive from active, and instead of <i>black</i>, it appears <i>citrine</i>,
like a wild <i>Poppy</i>. But our true <i>Calcination</i>, <i>conserves</i>
the <i>Radical Humidity</i> in the <i>Body</i> to be <i>dissolved</i>,
and it is finished in no other colour but <i>black</i>, and becomes a <i>discontinuous
Calx, unctuous, fatt</i>, and fit for<i> fusion</i>. Be therefore <i>Patient</i>,
that thou maist obtain thy Desire, because you will have very much cause
to
<i>Dispair</i>. When therefore we speak of our <i>Operations</i>, do
not think that we perfect them in one or two days, or see the <i>colours</i>
or <i>signes</i> in the first hour, No verily; but we have expected much
and long, till there was made an Agreement betwixt <i>contrary qualities</i>,
wherefore <i>Trevisan</i> Teaches in his <i>Practice</i>, who was a Learned
and good man in this <i>Art</i>, that <i>he staid in Prison</i>, that is,
<i>suspense</i>
of mind and <i>Doubt</i>, fourty days, but that he returned afterwards,
and saw <i>Clouds</i> and <i>Mists</i>. Moreover if thou should put Grain
into Good Land, thou shalt not look into the <i>Earth</i>, by moving it
every hour, that you may see, whether, and how much it begins to <i>increase</i>,
if you should do this, you could not expect a <i>sweet vegetation</i>,
much less <i>Fruit</i> from thence. So foolsh and Insipid are they who
as soon as ever they have joined the <i>Dissolvent</i> with the <i>Dissolvend</i>
presently seek some <i>signes</i> of the <i>Operation</i>, nor can satisfie
themselves, but they either move or open, or add, or detract something,
or at least increase the <i>Fire</i> to <i>accelerate</i> the
<i>work</i>,
and so by this means hinder the <i>work of Nature</i>; and therefore do
not attain the wished for Ends. Therefore attend to my <i>Doctrine</i>,
as soon as thou hast prepared the <i>Matter</i>, that is, <i>mature Sulphur
yellow</i>, with his <i>Crude white Sulphur</i>, and hast duely espoused
them, shut them up in a vessel and let them stand without trouble: if thou
rightly proceed, within twenty four Hours, thou shalt see thy <i>Compound</i>
swelling, and perhaps sending forth some <i>Bubbles</i>, by reason of the
Heat of thy <i>Sea water</i>, striving to excite the heat of the Included
Matter; but in the first <i>Entrance</i>, thou shalt behold the <i>variation</i>
of the <i>colours</i> slowly, (as at least it will seem to thee) because
then the keeper of the <i>Gate</i>, necessarily sustains many Labours,
because whatever is done, he alone then does it, because the <i>Bath</i>
is not yet prepared, that is, the <i>Natural heat</i> of the <i>King</i>,
is not yet stirred up. But when the <i>Bath</i> is made hot, our <i>Housekeeper</i>
shall sustain but few Labours, and the <i>operations</i> will be easily
to be distinguished. Therefore let the Sons of this <i>Art know</i> for
certain, that the first colour that will appear, after the <i>silver colour</i>
of the <i>Amalgama</i> of the <i>Body</i> will not be perfect black, for
this colour does not come in a moment, but every day the more <i>whiteness</i>
is diminished, the more blackness will supervene, until at last it be <i>compleated</i>.
For <i>blackness</i> is a sign of a dissolved <i>Body</i>, which is not
made in one hour, but by little and little, but Uncessantly: for the <i>Tincture</i>
proceeding from the <i>Reins of Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>, shews itself black
to the Eyes, but is Extracted insensibly, and imperceptibly. Therefore,
the coming of Blackness and the departure of the <i>Tincture</i>, out of
the Bowels of the <i>Dissolvend Body</i>, is the same measure and <i>term
of time</i>, because as soon as the Tincture is wholly gone out, so soon
the <i>blackness</i> will be perfect and absolute. Concerning this, hear
what <i>Ludus Puerorum</i> sayes, ‘<i>First, by how much the more thou
Decocts, so much the more thou subtilizeth the Gross, and blackens the
Compound</i>'. And <i>Bernard Trevesan</i> saith, ‘<i>The Earth of the
rest beginning to predominate, the blackness of the Element appears, but
does not obtain his dominion but by little and little’</i>. To finish in
a word, there are only four Principle <i>Colours</i>, the first whereof
is <i>Blackness</i>, and that most slow in coming, and longest in duration,
which if it were made <i>perfect</i> by a <i>momentary Ingress</i>, the
work would be most <i>expeditious</i>, for it should not perish more slowly
then it came, and remain in the top of <i>blackness</i> for an hour: For
there is no <i>Interstitium</i> in these Operations, but it <i>Increaseth</i>
to the height of one <i>Degree</i>, at which it no sooner arrives, but
<i>Decreases</i>
again, therefore it ascends slowly to <i>blackness</i>, and descends slowly
from it but there is not a <i>Moment</i> in which it doth not ascend or
descend, for nothing resteth but in its End, but <i>blackness</i> is not
the end of our <i>Stone, ergo</i>, etc. How then shall <i>blackness</i>
appear? To wit even as night comes, for first the <i>Twilight</i>, at last
<i>Dark
Night</i>, and that by <i>insensible Degrees</i>, every <i>moment</i> there
being less Light in the <i>Air</i> then another, until at last there be
no Light at all, then it is <i>deep Night</i>, but all this is wont to
be within an hour, yet the <i>Motion</i> is <i>insensible</i>: But our
work because it requires a longer time, the <i>motion</i> must needs be
more <i>Imperceptible.</i> Thou therefore that seekest this, consider the
<i>Example</i>
produced, and thou shalt have thy Answer.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Objection</i>, But after the first <i>Excitation</i>
of the Matter, the <i>Tincture</i> goes out every hour and moment, but
the <i>colour</i> of the <i>Tincture</i> going out, is blackest <i>blackness</i>,
therefore after the first stirring up of the <i>Matter</i>, blackest <i>blackness</i>
will appear in an hour.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We Answer, the blackest <i>blackness</i>, is of the
<i>Tincture</i>
gone out, but not of the going out, or if so, yet it goes out <i>Insensibly</i>,
but <i>insensible blackness</i>, although most <i>black</i>, when it goes
into much <i>white</i>, will not manifest the blackest <i>blackness</i>
in the whole <i>Compound</i>, but a <i>whitish colour</i>, but if to be
the <i>Subject</i> of <i>Whiteness</i>, be not <i>subtile</i> and well
<i>depurated</i>,
even as this <i>white</i> is now, then its <i>Tincture</i> in its first
<i>Egress</i>,
is not <i>compleatly Black</i>, but it obtains this by a
<i>Putrefaction</i>,
which is not a bare <i>Egress </i>of the
<i>Tincture</i>, but a <i>Repugnance</i>
and <i>Resistance</i> from it, which ariseth between the outgoing <i>Tincture</i>,
and the <i>extracting Water</i>, that is, between the <i>Sulphur</i> and
<i>Mercury</i>. Concerning this thing hear the saying of <i>Morienus</i>,
‘<i>Our operation is nothing else, but an Extracting of Water out of its
Earth, nor that only, but a returning of the Water upon the Earth, unless
the Earth putrefie'</i>. Therefore the
<i>Tincture</i> is not altogether
black of it self, but most white, because by how much the more the <i>Tincture</i>
goes out, which is the Soul, by so much the more the Earth which is the
<i>Body</i>, is
<i>dispirited</i>, and so it putrefies and Blackens.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long time then, must we expect, before it be
perfectly black? In this thing attend to what <i>Flammel</i> sayes, ‘<i>The
colour which thou ought first to see is blackness and that not every, but
most black, and that within the space of Fourty dayes</i>’: Also <i>Ripley</i>
sayes, ‘<i>Suffer the Commixt, and Coequated Natures, to lye together six
Weeks, which time expect with a slow Fire</i>’. When the Colours dye they
will show it, for at that time they will Boyl like Liquid <i>Pitch</i>
and will putrifie. And <i>Bernard</i> in his <i>Parable</i> says, ‘<i>The
King putting off his splendid Robes, gives the Silken ones to Saturn, being
Cloathed in black, which he retains fourty dayes</i>’. All this understand
of <i>blackness</i> in its height, which is plain from the above-repeated
words of <i>Flammel</i>, but a more remiss blackness, will appear sooner;
so the <i>Scala Philosophorum</i> sayes, ‘<i>Within sixteen dayes in the
degree of Putrefaction, an easie Fire being kept, the matter will be continually
Covered with blackness</i>’. And this either later or sooner, according
to the <i>Ingenuity</i> of the Operator, in <i>Adapting</i> the Matters.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whether will intermedial Colours appear, in a
Progress from white to black, as in the Progress from black to white? It
seems so, because there is no <i>transition</i> from one extream to another,
unless by Mediums: And we answer that they so appear, although indeed confusedly,
and some in some Works will appear in a Progress to the height of blackness,
which perhaps they are only accidental <i>Colours</i>: but not altogether
the same, betwixt the first Whiteness and Blackness, which are between
this, and ultimate Whiteness, because there is not the same <i>Reason</i>
of <i>Matter</i>; in the former the thick <i>Terrestrial Matter</i> was
to be <i>burned</i> and <i>purified</i>, but in this work the <i>Matter</i>
is more <i>spiritual</i> and pure; therefore in a pure or <i>Depurated
Subject</i>, in a <i>Progress</i> from the <i>extremity</i> of <i>Whiteness</i>,
the Intermedial Colours will be much more clear and admirable, then those
which appeared in an Earthly Subject. But in both progresses they will
appear, in the former <i>transition</i>, between the Extreams, Obscurer,
fewer and fouler; in the Latter, more, more shining and splendid, witness
the Philosopher, ‘After the heighth of Blackness, before Whiteness, in
the hour of Conjunction great Miracles will appear: For whatever Colours
could be thought on in the whole World then will be conspicuous’. And <i>Ripley</i>
sayes, <i>‘In our work colours will appear, then which never more fair
appeared’</i>.
Also before perfect Blackness the intermedial Colours will show themselves,
witness the <i>Philosopher</i>, who Painting the Colours will show themselves,
witness the Philosophers, who Painting the Colours of the Dragons, saith
<i>‘They are black, Yellow and Azure’</i>, and these intermedial Colours
says he, denote that thy Confections are not yet perfectly putrefied. In
a Word, the various Colours in Dying, will appear more obscure, but thin
and dew, and this before black Night <i>obnubilate</i> the whole
<i>Horizon</i>.
Put in rising again, very many and very Splendid ones will arise, because
the Body now begins to be glorified, and the Light to predominate over
the Darkness and this in a depurated, and spiritual Subject.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in what order will these aforesaid Colours appear?
This truly cannot be determined, because they are varied many ways, but
the better the juice of the Water of Life shall be, the better the Signs
shall appear. The order of the four Principle Colours is described by all,
but no one can determine the order of the accidental ones, let it suffice
thee if within fourty dayes, thou hast a compleat blackness, don’t mind
other things much, but it is good to attend, for blackness is first Especially
desirable, and tho others appear, unless thou seest this without doubt
thou has ered. But as I said, other Colours are not to be Dispised, except
the Venerial, or imperfect Red, which if it appear before blackness, is
to be suspected, especially when the siccity of the Copound, and Discontinuity
of the parts accompany it, I say this Precipitation is a fatal Index to
the Operator of his lost time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same thing the <i>Philosopher</i> witnesses,
saying, <i>‘A vehement Fire hinders Conjunction, and tinges white, with
the color of the wild Poppy'</i>. And <i>Flammel</i> in his <i>Hieroglyphical
Figures</i>, sayes, <i>‘Unless thou behold, the blackest black of black
whatever colour thou seest, thou art in the way of Error: But especially
a reddish colour is to be suspected, for if thou seest that, thou has burned,
or art burning the lively virtue of the Stone’</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I must stay no longer in these things,
since one Water does all this, so that the Internal Compound, continually
be ruled, with External heat; neither is there any thing, in the whole
Work more Wonderful, then this our Water, which I have fully Described
above, to which place I send thee back.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>Concerning Solution</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Dissolution of our <i>Stone</i>, is the Reduction
of it into its first matter, the Manifestation of the Humid, and the Extraction
of Natures from their <i>Profundity</i>, which is finished by bringing
them into a Mineral Water.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Operation is of no Light Work or Moment, for
how hard it is, those that have toiled in it can attest.
