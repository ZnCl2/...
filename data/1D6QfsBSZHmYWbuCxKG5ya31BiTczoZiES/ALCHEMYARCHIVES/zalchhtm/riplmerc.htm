<p><br>I will, my dearest Son, instruct thee in this Blessed Science, Which
was hid from the Wise of old, to whom God was pleased to shew so much favour.
Know therefore, that our Matter is the chiefest of all things in the Earth,
and of least estimation and account, as will hereafter more plainly appear.
For if Water incorperate it self with Earth, the Water will be lowest of
all, and will (if it be not kept down) with Fire, ascend higher; and thus
it may be seen, how Water will be highest and lowest. Yet true it is, that
it is of least estimation, for in our Earth and Water, and in that drossie
Earth, you may find some very pure and clear, which is our Seed and fifth
Essence, and then that foul and drosse Earth is good for nothing else,
and of no estimation. But that Water, as I said, is the chiefest, will
appear many ways: Know, Son, that without Water we cannot make make Bread,
nor anything else, which God hath created in Nature; and hence you may
easily perceive, that Water is the first Matter of all things which are
born or generated in the World: for certainly ‘tis manifest unto thee,
that nothing grows or receiveth increase without the four Elements; therefore
whatsoever is Elemented by virtue of the four Elements, it must of necessity
be, that original of all things that are born or grow, should be of Water:
Yet ought you not to understand, this before spoken of Water, but of that
Water which is the Matter of all things, out of which all Natural things
are produced in their kind. Know therefore, that the first of all Air is
engendered of Water; of Air, Fire; of Fire, Earth. Now will I more familiarly
and friendly discourse with thee; I'le further manifest this Mystery unto
thee by degrees, lest by too much haste it happen to us according to the
Proverb, That he that makes too much haste, oftentimes comes home too late.
Now therefore that I may satisfie thy desire, I will discourse of the first
Matter, which Philosophers call, the fifth Essence, and many other names
they have for it, by which they may the more obscure it. In it for certain
are four Elements, pure in their Exaltation: Know therefore, that if you
would have the fifth Essence, Man, you must first have Man, and you must
have nothing else of that Matter; and see that you observe this well. This
I say, that if you desire to have the Philosophers Stone, you must of necessity
first have the fifth Essence of that same Stone, whether it be Mineral
or Vegetative; joyn therefore species with species, and Gems with Gems,
and not the one without the other, nor anything contrary, which may be
other than the species or proper Gems; beware therefore of all that is
not Essential: For of Bones, Stones cannot be made, neither do Cranes beget
Geese; which if you will consider, you'l find the profit of it, by the
help of the Divine Grace; by the assisitance whereof let us father proceed
to speak of this blessed Water, which is called the Water of the Sun and
Moon, hidden in the concavity of our Earth. Concerning which Earth know,
that all that is generated must of necessity have Male and Female, from
which action and passion arise, without which Generation never is. But
you will certainly never receive profit from things differing in kinds.
Notwithstanding, if you have this Water of the Sun and Moon, it will draw
other Bodies and Humours to its own kind, by the help of the virtue and
the heat of the Sun and Moon, and will make them perfect. As an Infant
in the womb of its Mother, decoction of temperate heat helping it, turneth
the Flowers into its Nature and kind, that is, into Flesh, Bloud, Bones,
and Life, with the other properties of a living Body, of which ‘tis needless
to say any more. And hence you may understand, that our water changeth
it self into a perfect kind, which things of its own kind: For first it
will congeal it self into a substance like Oyl; then it will change that
Oyl, by the means of temperate heat, into Gum; and lastly, by the help
of the perfect heat of the Sun, into a Stone. Now therefore know, that
out of one thing you have three, that is Oyl, Gum, and a Stone. Know also,
that when the Water is turned into Oyl, then you have a perfect Spirit;
when the Oyl is turned into hard Gum, then you have a perfect Spirit and
Soul; and when the Spirit and Soul are turned into a Stone, then you have
a perfect Body, Soul and Spirit together: Which as it is called the Philosophers
Stone and Elixir, and a perfect Medicine of mans Body; so also that which
is leavened with its genus, and the fifth Essence. Know, Son, that fifth
Essences are divers, one whereof is to Humane Bodies, another to Elixir,
and to the imperfect Bodies of Metals: For you must consider, that the
generation and growth of Metals, is not as the growth of mans Body; for
a genus agrees with its genus, and a species with its species. Moreover,
know that the first Matter of man, which begetteth the Flesh, Bloud, Bones
and Life, is a Spermatick Humour, which causeth generation, through a vital
Spirit included therein: And when the Matter is generated and congealed
into a Body, extract thence the fifth Essence of that Body, wherewith you
may nourish the Body. Yet Son, will I tell thee moreover, that Water, or
Matter, or Seed whereof Man is begot, is not the augmenter of the Body.
Know, Son, that if the Body be fed with its Natural food, then its first
Matter will be increased, and also the Body, (viz.) the first Matter in
quality, and the Body in quantity; the first Matter is that which is called
the fifth Essence. Yet Know, Son, that the fifth Essence is one thing,
and that the Matter of augmentation is another: and, as I said before,
the increase of Metals, is not like the increase of mans Body. Although
the fifth Essence, which causeth the augmentation of the Metals, may be
a fit Medicine for Humane Bodies; as also the fifth Essence, which causeth
the augmentation of mans Body, may be a fit Medicine for the Bodies of
Metals: and therefore, as before is said, the fifth Essence is one thing,
and augmentation another. You see therefore for what reason our Water is
called, the first Matter and the Seed of Metal;, viz. because of it all
Metals are generated. Therefore you will have need of it in the beginning,
middle, and end, for as much as it is the cause of all generation, because
by its Congelation, it is turned into all sorts of Metals, to wit, into
the first Matter of the sorts. Thence it is called, the Seed of Metals,
and the *Metallick Water of Life: [*So it is in the Latine, though perhaps
the words should be Vita Metallica, that is, the Water of Metallick Life,
that is, of the Life of Metals] because it affords Life and Bloud to sick
and dead Metals, &amp; joyneth in Matrimony the Red man and the White woman,
that is, the Sun and the Moon. It is called also Virgins Milk; for as long
as it is not joyned with the Sun and the Moon; nor with anything else,
except only those which are or its own kind, so long it may be called a
Virgin. But when it is joyned with a Male and Female, and married with
them, then it is no longer a Virgin, because it adhereth to them, and becomes
one with them to whom it is joyned with to generation. But as long as it
remains a Virgin, it is called Virgins Milk, the Blessed Water, and the
Water of Life, and by many other Names.
<p>And now, my Son, that I may say something of the Philosophers Mercury,
know that when thou hast put thy Water of Life to the Red man, who is our
Magnesia, and to the White woman, whose name is Albifica, and they shall
all have been gathered together into one, then you have the true Philosophers
Mercury. For after that in this manner all is joyned with a Male and Female,
then it is called the Philosophers Mercury, the Philosophers Water of Life,
the Bloud of Man, his red Flesh, his Body and Bones. Know therefore, that
there are many sorts of Milk, (viz.) Virgins Milk, Womans Milk, and also
Mans Milk: For when first they are joyned in one, and she is big, having
conceived, then the Infant must be nourished with Milk: But then you may
know, that this Milk is not Virgins Milk, but rather the man and the womans
Milk, wherewith it is always to ne nourished, till it is grown to that
strength, that it may be brought up with stronger and fuller food. That
food which I mean is the leavening of it which gives it form, that it may
perform Virile work: For until the Infant, that is, this our stone, be
formed and leavened with its like, the Bloud of the green Dragon, and the
red Bloud of the Red Dragon, whether it be the white Stone or the red,
it will never do a perfect work. Know therefore, Son, that the first Water
is that Water Rebar, which God made of Nature, and it is the cause of Generation,
as I said before; but when after the conjunction which ariseth from the
Marriage, it begets the Water of Life, and the Philosophers Milk, with
one of which, or both, you must augment and feed your Stone perpetually.
<p>Much more could I say to thee, Son, concerning this first Matter, but
let this suffice, that setting aside impertinencies of words, we may now,
Divine Grace favouring of us, proceed to the practice it self of the Philosophick
Stone. See therefore, my Son, that thou diligently puttest all these Matters(which
though they are three things, yet are they but one only) in a Glass Vessel,
and lettest them quietly putrefie: then put an Alembick upon your Vessel,
and by distillation draw out all the Water, which may be thence distilled.
Try this first in Maries Bath. Then place the the Vessel in Ashes, and
make a gentle Fire for 12 hours: then take the Matter out of the Vessel,
grind it well by it self, without the foresaid Water, then put it again
into the Vessel with Water, and stop the Vessel close. Put it in the Bath
for three days, and the distill the Water as before in the Bath, and the
Matter will be more black than before. Do thus three times over, and then
grind it no more; but afterwards as often as you distill it, so oft pour
Water on the top: but between each distillation give it so much Fire fore
six hours or more, till it become indifferent dry; then pour Water on the
top again, and dissolve it again in the Bath under a blind Alembick. Also
in every distillation separate the Flegm, by casting away siw or seven
drops of Water in he beginning of each distillation. And observing this
order, cause it to drink its proper Water, till it hath drink of it seven
times its weight which it had at the first. But then it will be of a white
colour, and so much whiter, by how much the more of its own Water it hath
drank. This is white Elixir.
<p>Moreover, this our Water is called Homogeneal, and by many other names.
Besides, know that this Water and Matter generate as well the Red Stone,
as the White: Know also, when this first Matter is brought to its compleat
whiteness, then the end of one, is the beginning of the other; that is,
of the Red Stone, which is our Red Magnesia, and Virgins Brass, as we said
at first: Son, see thou well understand these words. Our Virgins Brass,
is our Gold; yet I do not say, that all Brass is Gold: also our Brass,
is our live Brimstone; but all Brimstone, is not our live Brimstone: also
Quicksilver, is Mercury; but I do not say, that common Quicksilver, is
our Silver: as I said before, that Water of Life which is our Seed and
first Matter, is our Mercury and our Spirit of Life, which is extracted
out of the blessed land of Aethiopia, which is called Magnesia, and by
many other names. Besides, my Son, know that there is no perfect generation,
without corruption; for corruption causeth cleanliness, and cleanliness
corruption. Consider therefore, Son, our dying poison, which dyeth and
is dyed perpetually; and this is our Body, or Soul, and our Spirit, when
they are joyned together in one, and become one thing, which with its parts
ariseth also out of one thing, besides which there is not any other, neither
ever shall be. Wherefore, my Son, great folly it is for any one to believe,
that any other Medicine can be turned into Gold or Silver; which Medicine
will little profit thee of it self, except it be mingled with a Body, for
then shall it perfect its work according to its form which it is born:
For it is never born that it may of it self become a Body. Moreover, know
that there is as much difference between the first Matter, which is called
the Seed of Metals, and the Medicine, as is between the Medicine and Gold:
For the Seed will never be the Medicine without Body, neither will the
Medicine ever be a Metal without a Body. Much difference also there is
between Elixir and the Medicine, as between the Masculine and Feminine
Seed, and also an Infant which is generated of those in the Matrice. Now
you may see, that the Seed is one thing, and the Infant another; though
they be one and the same in kind, one thing, one operation, the Vessel
finally one, though it be called by divers names: For a Man and Woman,
is an Infant born, when as yet the Man is one thing, and the Woman another,
though they be one and the same in kind: which you ought to understand
in our Stone. But what I said before, that corruption is the cause of generation,
and of cleanliness, is true: For you must know, that every thing in its
first Matter is corrupt and bitter, which corruption and bitterness is
called dying poison, which is the cause of Life in all things, as will
be sufficiently manifest, if you with right reason do weigh the Natures
of things. Consider well, O Son, that when Lucifer the Angel of Pride,
first rebbelled against God, and prevaricated the Command of the most High,
be assured that this was made corrupt, bitter, and harsh to him: No less
was the fall and prevarication of our first Parents Adam and Eve, whom
death and condemnation followed, made to them corruption and bitterness,
and likewise to us in whom the same corruption is propagated. Many more
like examples I could recite, if need were: But setting aside these, to
come to what is proper to our discourse; consider well, that of all precious
Fruits which grow out of the Earth, their first Matter is bitter and harsh,
as still retaining some footstep of the former corruption and putrefaction;
which bitterness, by the means of continual action of natural heat, is
with great virtue turned into sweetness. Now therefor, Son, if thou wilt
be ingenious, this little will suffice whereby to find out much more, and
to perceive my meaning: Consider therefore well, Son, that according to
the old Proverb,
<p>He sweet deserves not, who no bitter tasts.
<p>But now to speak something more of our Brass; know, that Brass signifies
continuance, or continuing Water: But what is farther to be considered
in the nature of the name of Brass, you may easily gather from its English
Tetragrammate name, that is, its name consisting of four letters, to wit,
B.R.A.S. First therefore, by B. is signified the Body of our Work, which
is sweet and bitter, our Olive and our Brass continuing in its form: by
R. is signified the Root of our Work, and the Spring of continuing Radical
Humours, which is our Red Tincture, and Red Rose which purifieth all in
its kind: A. signifies our Father Adam, who was the first man, out of whom
was born the first woman Eve; whence you understand, that therein is Male
and Female. Know therefore, that our Brass is the beginning of our Work,
our Gold and Olive, for it is the first Matter of Metals, as Man is the
first Man and Woman. S. signifies the Soul of our Life, and Spirit of Life,
which God breathed into Adam, and all the creatures; which Spirit is called
the fifth Essence. Moreover, Son, by these four Letters, we may understand
the four Elements, without which nothing is generated in Nature. They also
signifie Sol and Lune, which are the causes of all Life, Generation, and
augmentation of all things born in the World. In this name therefore of
four letters, consisteth our whole Work: For our Brass is Male and Female,
of which ariseth he who is called begot. Therefore, Son, take good notice
what is signified by our sweet Brass, what is called our Sandiver, or the
Salt of our Nitre, or Nitre; what also by the Bloud of the Dragon, what
Sol and Lune, our Mercury, and our Water of Life, and many other things,
concerning which Philosophers have spoken darkly, and in Riddles. Know
therefore, Son, that our first Matter is neither Gold, nor common Silver,
nor is it of corrosives, or such like outward things, which Denigrators
groping in the dark now-a-days do use. Take heed therefore, Son, that by
no means you admit any thing contrary in kind; for be assured, that what
a man shall have sowed, the same shall he reap. Moreover, know that when
our Stone is compleated in its proper kind, then it will be a hard Stone,
which will not easily be dissolved; yet if you add his Wife to him, he
will be dissolved into Oyl, which is called Philosophers Oyl, incombustible
Oyl, and by many other names. Know therefore, Son, that there are diverse
leavenings, as well as Corporal as Spititual, (viz.) Corporal in quantity,
and Spiritual in quality: Corporal leavening increaseth the weight and
quantity of the Medicine, yet is not of so great power as the Medicine
it self, as is Spiritual leavening; for it only encreaseth the Medicine
in quantity, not in virtue: but Spiritual leavening increaseth it in both;
and where the Corporal ruleth above an hundred, the Spiritual above a thousand.
Moreover, as long as the Medicine is leavened with the Corporal substance,
it is called Elixir. There is therefore a divers manner of leavening, and
a difference between the Medicine, and the Elixir; for the Spiritual is
one thing, the Corporal another. Know also, that as long as it is Spiritual
leavening, it is liquid Oyl and Gum, which cannot conveniently be carried
about from one place to another; but when it is Corporal, then it will
be a Stone which you may carry about in your Pocket. Now therefore you
see what is the difference between the Medicine, and the Elixir; nor is
the difference less between Elixir, and Gold and Silver, for Gold and Silver
are difficult to melt, but Elixir not so, for it easily dissovles at the
flame of a Candle: thence you may easily perceive, how various the differences
of our composition and temperament are. Lastly, that we may say something
concerning their food and drink, know that their food is of airy Stones,
and their drink is drawn out of two perfect Bodies, namely out of the Sun
and Moon; the drink that is drawn out of the Sun, is called liquid Gold,
(or Potable, that is, that may be drank;) but that out of the Moon, is
called Virgins Milk. Now, Son, we have discoursed plainly enough with thee,
if Divine Grace be not wanting to thee; for that drink that is drawn out
of the Sun, is Red, but that out of the Moon, is white; and therefore one
is called liquid Gold, but the other Virgins Milk; one is Masculine, the
other Feminine, though both ariseth out of one Image, and one kind. Son,
ponder my words, otherwise if thou wanderest in the dark, that evil befalls
thee from defect of light: See therefore that thou beest diligent in turning
the Philosophick Wheel, that thou mayst make Water out of Earth, Air out
of Water, Fire our of Air, and Earth out of Fire, and all this out of one
Image and Root, that is, out of its own proper kind, and natural food wherewith
its Life may be cherished without end. He who hath understanding, let him
understand.
<p>Glory to God Omnipotent.
