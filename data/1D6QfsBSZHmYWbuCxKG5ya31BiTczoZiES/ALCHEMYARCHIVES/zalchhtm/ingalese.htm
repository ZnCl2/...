<p><b>Introduction ~</b>
<p>Those interested in metaphysical and esoteric literature are most likely
familiar with the names of Richard and Isabella Inglese. Their books have
encouraged many to delve deeper into what is called "The Mystery of Life".
Among their publications still available today are: "History and Power
of Mind", "The Greater Mysteries", "Astrology and Health", "The Evolution
of God and Man", "Fragments of Truth", and "Occult Philosophy".
<p>Undoubtedly those who have read the books of Richard and Isabella Ingalese
suspected that the contents thereof were an outcome of prolonged study,
but the direction that study was to take was almost unknown. Had it not
been for a public lecture given by Richard Ingalese at the end of the 1920's
(he copyrighted this essay in 1928 under his name) we would as yet be relatively
unaware of the goals their studies achieved. As will be seen in this article,
all their mental efforts were aimed at a substantiation of the law of polarity.
It became apparent to them that theory alone without its counterpart in
practical manifestation, cannot endure for long. Just as body and mind
are a unit animated by spirit, so must theory become animated by praxis.
Even if animation were possible, a body without a mind is incomplete and
could at best be described as an automation. Yet even here, mind must necessarily
control the material manifestation.
<p>The student enters into metaphysics or esotericism by way of theory,
which theory must eventually prove itself in practice. Manifestation can
only be established by practical application of theory through knowledge.
The outcome thereof either proves or disproves the theory. All manifestation
is accomplished by the utilization of Will, which is but another term for
"being alive."
<p>Life is wherever substance exists and wherever life and substance are,
there we find governing mind or consciousness. In other words, consciousness
exists in the atom and electron as well as in the galaxies of the universe.
Understood in this light, the old hermetic axiom "as above so below, as
below so above," takes on a more profound meaning. Since time immemorial
men have tried to find the key which would unlock the mystery of all existence-not
just concerning mankind, but for all substance and non-substance alike.
Therefore subjective and objective have separate meanings. The former dealing
with the intangible and the latter with the tangible. An interplay of the
two creates phenomena. Since mind cannot be separated from the very substance
it governs, one cannot exist without the other.
<p>In the universe there is but one primal substance, no matter how dense,
how coarse, or how subtle and seemingly imperceptible. This primordial
first substance is known as "Chaos." Substance is found in all forms and
manifestations in this state and it is therefore termed "chaotic." Matter
is formed out of this state according to the requirements and specific
circumstances in the ever evolving spiral of evolution. In this way matter
is ever becoming or ever changing and does not remain stationary. This
is the meaning of the words "chaotic condition" and is not to be confused
with the generally accepted definition of disorderliness. Everything in
this chaotic state is according to law and order, but because of its multitudinous
expressions, understanding of the true meaning escapes the finite mind
of man conveying to him the image of a chaotic condition without law and
order. Paradoxically, the reverse is true.
<p>Similarly in the universe there is but one mind or supreme consciousness,
known also as the Oversoul or Overself, etc. Each particle of the "Chaos"
is imbued with a segment of this overall consciousness, or soul essence;
often called, "a spark of the Divine."
<p>There is only one universal life or spirit. All substance is alive-even
that which we call dead. A corpse for example, could not undergo putrefaction
or what man calls disintegration from one state of being to another were
this not the case. The overall consciousness or sum total of a coordinated
being, such as man, may have its dominating composite consciousness removed
and implanted in different forms of substance, but the inherent consciousness
of each cell is still active as a unit. Whenever a unification of individualized
particles of substance occurs, a superior state of consciousness takes
temporary control. In this manner an adeptship is eventually revealed in
a personification evolving through individualized cell expressions. In
the animal world these cellular units of expression are known by a variety
of names from the lowest amoeba to man.
<p>Body, Spirit and Soul are the three essentials in our universe. All
esoteric approaches have as their aim the separation of these into distinct
entities. Whoever cannot separate Body, Spirit and Soul, is not prepared
to enter into the realm of the alchemist. It is here and here only that
the reunification takes place.
<p>To test this theory was the aim of Richard and Isabella Ingalese. Only
by so doing could it be substantiated or refuted. For them Alchemy provided
the only means of verification.
<p>When one reads of the time consumed to achieve demonstrable proof, it
becomes evident that practical application is more difficult than theorizing.
First proper reading material had to be found which would shed light on
the subject and indicate a method of procedure, beginning with theoretical
instruction. Even here complications arose. It was more difficult to find
a competent teacher than at first anticipated as even the theoretical teachings
conflicted. In fact, most of the teachers believed physical laboratory
alchemy to be nonexistent. The subject matter was to be understood in a
spiritual sense only. When questioned, the answers inevitably were that
alchemy was of a mental nature, never to be understood literally or demonstrated
on a practical-physical plane of awareness. The practical plane found few
followers, while the mental had most of the adherents.
<p>If practical alchemy lacked only proof, one may logically question why
a division was necessary. This is exactly where the trouble began. There
were and still are many advocate of mental or spiritual alchemy who after
attempts to find " practical laboratory alchemy came to the inevitable
conclusion that there was none. Why? They confused alchemy with chemistry!
True, the Encyclopedia tells the reader that alchemy was the forerunner
of our present day chemistry, and chemists `long ago dispensed with the
silly superstitions embedded in alchemy. For it is a fact that anyone taking
the alchemistical symbolical terms at face value, is doomed to failure.
For example, such terms as Sulphur, Salt and Mercury, are not what their
names imply but are only indicative of symbolic expressions.
<p>Here was the reason for their failure! Failure will continue for all
who are not guided in factual alchemy by competent teachers. It was this
instruction that the Ingalese's lacked. Nowhere is there an indication
that either of them had such a teacher. The two volumes of Paracelsus translated
by A. E. Waite into English, was their theoretical fountainhead. Paracelsus
gave practical advice, but through the printed word only. There was no
oral instruction nor the assistance of practical demonstrations. Every
step had to be concentrated upon, then carefully tested, with failure as
an inevitable result of their first trials. It is not surprising that many
years were spent in trial and error before the first meager results appeared.
<p>In 1911, Richard Ingalese then in his fifty-sixth year and his wife
in her forty-eighth year were, in his words, "determined to put our conception
of the teachings of Paracelus to laboratory tests and commenced our experiments”.
It took them nine long years of continuous hard work before their labors
finally met with success and they achieved their goal, namely the Philosopher's
Stone. In the first six of those years they experienced many failures and
heartbreaking disappointments.
<p>Those who have worked in practical alchemy will be somewhat startled
if not disappointed by statements Richard Ingalese made in his lecture.
First, he differentiated between the metallic alchemy and the medicinal,
which later they decided to follow. The question is: "Why did he not test
the stone upon the metals to see if it tinged?”. Here would have been sufficient
proof of its medicinal virtue and strength. Secondly, he stated the dose
which both took twice a week, was the size of an uncooked grain of rice.
This would seem an enormously large dose judging from reports of earlier
Alchemists.
<p>In answer to the first question, it would be logical to assume that
the test was probably made upon metals but very wisely not mentioned in
the lecture because of the consequences such a statement would have aroused
in public. For this reason the question may have been deliberately avoided
and left unanswered. This is only an assumption on my part, and may be
taken by the reader for what it is worth.
<p>The second question is not so obscure. The large dose could possibly
have been due to an insufficient potency of the stone. Ingalese himself
says that in its first state it looked like soft white marble and only
after laboring an additional three years did they complete the red stone
which he describes by saying, "the product was crude." This would seem
to indicate that the stone lacked sufficient maturity to allow a reduction
in dosage.
<p>We are not greatly concerned here with the individuals known as Richard
and Isabella Ingalese nor to their whereabouts up to the nineteen thirties
and thereafter. We are, however, interested in the message they gave and
in the alchemical work performed by a married couple. The husband, Richard
Ingalese, attorney at law, found it necessary to give a public address
on Alchemy outlining their combined results in the laboratory, and then
proceeded to publish those findings. Unfortunately, unlike Volpier, who
died in 1947 in Germany, and who described in detail the process he had
followed, the Ingaleses did not give specific outlines of the procedures
involved. Consequently their steps and methods cannot be duplicated and
verified. Even here, however, pronounced differences in the procedure are
evident and cannot be overlooked. We plan to publish a translation of the
original manuscript of Volpier (his nom de plume) in a future issue of
the Golden Manuscript Series. Archibald Cockren, who began in practical
alchemy at about the same time as the lngaleses, in the somewhat sketchy
description in his book "Alchemy Restored and Rediscovered" gives more
details than revealed by Ingalese in his lecture.
<p>As for now, we can only concur with the final words of Richard Ingalese
in his lecture when he said, "This is our testimony on behalf of Alchemy-which
each person may accept, or reject, according to his conviction."

<p><b><font size=+2>ALCHEMY</font></b></center>

<p>Wherever there is sunshine, there is shadow. Wherever there is the genuine,
there is the imitation; and nowhere, in all history, is it truer than in
regard to Alchemy. Particularly was it noticeable during the Middle Ages.
Then there was a recrudescence of Alchemy; and because there were a few
genuine Occultists that came forward to call the attention of the world
to the ancient art, immediately there sprang up hundreds and hundreds of
pretenders; and this has continued from the time of Paracelsus to the present.
Because of these pretenders I want to talk very plainly tonight about them
in order to save your faith and your pocketbooks.
<p>By faith is meant that as soon as he has a taste of psychism, his mind
turns to the Occult Sciences and then he is in a current of thought that
draws to him both good and bad. I mean, by bad, those people who have studied
Occult Sciences, acquired a smattering of knowledge, and, having failed
to achieve any degree of success, commence to recoup all the financial
outlay they have made from their credulous fellow students.
<p>The destruction of faith is worse than the depletion of the pocketbook;
but students are liable to both when they enter the occult current.
<p>If you find that you are being imposed upon, when with all sincerity
you are devoting your time, thought, and money to study, the shock is so
great that you are too apt to throw the whole thing aside and say, "It
is so honeycombed with dishonesty that I don't wish to have anything to
do with it." That is the destruction of your faith and is a real calamity,
because sometimes several incarnations must pass before you come to the
point where you are once more willing to again make the venture. And so
I warn you of what you may meet in the occult currents. The Occult Sciences
are the hidden sides of the physical sciences. Everything that has a manifestation
in the physical world has a corresponding manifestation in the metaphysical
world. To illustrate, in the case of Astronomy: If you are studying it
from the physical side, you have a number of theories to account for the
origin of planets. You know something of their chemical constituency, something
of their, movements and other incidental matters of that kind. But the
occult side of Astronomy would be to know how the planets came into existence,
the cause of their motion, and the purpose of their being.
<p>The Occultist is not satisfied with theories. He wants facts. He is
not content with the phenomena of life, he wants the noumena, or cause;
and therefore he studies on both sides of all the sciences. When you commence
to study causes, instead of effects, you immediately get into the occult
current, and sooner or later you meet both wise and unwise people. A great
many persons have studied occult books and therefore call themselves Occultists;
but they are only book Occultists -- quite different from practical Occultists.
The sciences and philosophy are only theories with them, which may be right,
or which may be wrong. They seldom attempt to prove either. These teachers
of book Occultism are doing good work if they do not pretend to have what
they do not possess. If they tell you they have gained knowledge from the
inner side of being, and have only a theory to offer you and that theory
misdirects you, then your faith is shattered. But, there are people in
Occultism, as elsewhere, who teach for money only, and are indifferent
to the accuracy of their teaching. But do we not find much said about such
teachers in the Gospels, also?
<p>A short time ago I received a letter from one of the most prominent
astrologers in America, stating that he was compiling a book of occult
formulas. He asked me to subscribe for a copy. I replied, "The price you
charge is remarkably low, only twenty-five dollars a copy. If your formulas
are the results of the laboratory, and not of the library, you may put
me down for a book; but if they are of the library, I don't want it-because
probably I have all the books you have used in your compilation and perhaps
a few more." He was honest enough to write, "It is the result of my researches
in the library." Many persons who did not know the distinction between
library and laboratory paid the price for that book, which was useless
to them.
<p>When in New York, two years ago, I met some of my old students whom
I had not seen for many years. A group of them were studying Alchemy. I
was somewhat amazed and, of course, interested. I asked to meet their teacher,
be cause, for the first time in the history of the world, laboratory Alchemy
was being taught openly. When they tried to find him, he had disappeared,
but not until he had collected his fees. He had selected for his pupils
those who had studied Occult Philosophy for years and supposedly knew something.
First, he taught them what the books said about the theories of Alchemy.
Then, two nights before he left-not telling them he was going, he said,
"I shall give you the formula for making gold, which is easy to do; the
only difficulty is to dispose of the metal after you get it." And they
were credulous enough to believe it.
<p>He said, '`I will give you the name of all the elements except one.
That is not permitted to be given out, but I will concentrate upon it and
you who are intuitive will get that name. Then you can go home and make
all the gold you want on your kitchen stove." And they accepted his statement
as true.
<p>He charged a large amount of money for his course of lectures; and the
only "Alchemy" he knew was the alchemy of human nature. Of course, a person
with common sense would say, "If this man knows how to make gold, why is
lie going about giving lectures at several hundred dollars a course, when
all he had to do was to use his kitchen stove and make all he wanted?"
<p>The person who divulged the secret is a promoter of railroads and accustomed
to handle large financial transactions; and yet, he was credulous enough
to accept a floating faker's statement when it came to the Occult.
<p>A woman who studied with me for a short time -- a very short time before
I ended her studentship, subsequently went to Arabia; and when she returned,
sought people in New York City and in Chicago who were interested in Occultism-she
is operating in Washington now - and said that while she was in Arabia
one of the great Occultists there imparted to her the knowledge of how
to make the "Great Elixir." She offered to sell it for a considerable sum,
claiming that it would restore youth in a few months; and she made people
believe it. Her stay in each city was limited, of course. The more incredible
such statements are, the greater number, of people believe them.
<p>A man came to me a short time ago and said he had a way of making jewels.
I replied, "A great many chemists can do that." He answered, "I make them
alchemically. You can't tell them from nature's gems. I want you to put
some money into the manufacture of them." I asked, "What is your process?
Just give me an intimation of one of the leading ingredients. Do you use
mercury?" "No," he said. "No mercury." I could but reply, "Then you have
not the knowledge you claim, for the oil of mercury is the basis of all
jewels."
<p>Other people may come to you who are earnest and sincere, but self-deceived.
I was in the Calkins Chemical Company a few days ago and was talking with
the manager, who said he had just had a funny experience. A man came in
and showed him a mass of melted, colored glass, and said, "I want five
hundred dollars, and, in the course of a month, will make myself and you
wealthy men, for I have found the great art of the Alchemists. I have learned
to transmute mercury into gold."
<p>The manager happened to be a hard-headed business man, more interested
in business than in the Occult, and replied, "How do you do it?" His visitor
answered, "I take a pound of mercury and go out into the sunshine, get
a certain angle of the sun's rays, let them pass through this glass and
fall upon the mercury, and the action of those rays through this glass
causes the mercury to change its vibrations; and immediately it is transmuted,
before your eyes, into gold”. The manager asked, "Have you two dollars?".
The man replied, "Yes”. "Then you don't need five hundred dollars, for
I shall be just as friendly to you as you have been to me. I will sell
you a pound of mercury for two dollars. Take it out on the sidewalk and
turn it into gold. That will give you half your capital, buy another pound
and you will have your five hundred dollars”.
<p>Twice I have been invited into the foothills near Los Angeles to see
men who had Alchemical laboratories, so-called, who desired to extend their
plants and only wanted a few thousand dollars for that purpose. The first
man had quite an elaborate assayer's outfit and he went through the process
of assaying for gold. He supposed I knew nothing about his process. After
finishing, he took out some gold he previously had put in, and said, "You
see how I make it?". I had to say, "I think you are a first-class assayer,
but not an Alchemist".
<p>Another man had a laboratory and wanted only ten or fifteen thousand
dollars to enlarge his plant. He claimed that by passing a current of electricity
through mercury it would be turned into gold. He said he had done it, and
yet he was collecting money to make gold.
<p>There are other people self-deceived, just as dangerous as those who
try to deceive you. I remember a number of years ago a man came to Chicago
and interested some banker in his process of transmuting junk into gold.
Some of the precious metal had to be used in the transmuting. As far as
I could learn, there was no accretion of gold; but the bankers thought
there was, and furnished the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for
the Alchemical Laboratory. Four days after the work was started, the inventor
blew himself and his plant to bits. The man was sincere, but had a wrong
theory and knew so little of chemistry, or of Alchemy, that only disaster
could occur.
<p>Forty years ago I first read the "Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of
Paracelsus". Of all the books I have seen oil the subject -- and I have
seen many -- there are no others which contain so much knowledge as those
two volumes. Dr. Waite's collection and translation is the best. Soon after
I had finished reading the two books, a man came to me and said, "I have
been doing some chemical work, and when I cleaned my ovens I found a piece
of gold the size of a silver half dollar, I want you and your friends to
join me in finding out where that gold came from. Unfortunately, I don't
know. I want money enough to live on until I can find how it was made".
I asked if he had no way of checking up his process. He answered, "No”.
I suggested the possibility that he had put something into his oven that
had contained gold and when the experiment was finished the precious metal
was left at the bottom. I did not join him, but many of the students of
Occultism did, and lost much money.
<p>Good strong characters who have failed in Alchemy do not defame the
art. Some of the wisest men in the world studied Alchemy and failed. Robert
Boyle, the great chemist, spent much of his time studying Alchemy. He was
one of the founders of the Royal Society in England. He was a strong character.
Finally, at the end of his life, he said he believed in Alchemy, absolutely,
but that he did not have the peculiar type of mind to lead him to success.
<p>Sir Isaac Newton spent the early part of his life trying to become an
Alchemist; and when he failed, he concluded that he did not have the talent
to gain the knowledge, but believed in it to the end of his life. These
men are of real merit, real scientists, men of character. When the average
man of little stamina and petty mind fails, he turns against the science
and either declares -- "There is nothing in it", or, if dishonest, he goes
forth to recoup his losses at the expense of the public.
<p>From the illustrations I have given, you can see readily that the path
of the investigator of the Occult Sciences is beset with dangers from both
wiseacres and conscious frauds. It behooves one, then, to be on guard constantly
when seeking either a teacher or a companion in one's studies. Always look
up the antecedents of a would-be associate. Find out what he has studied
and achieved. No one reaches success in Alchemy who first did not master
other things; for he requires the self-reliance which comes from many conquests
before he has the "will to do" -- to persist. If a person poses as a teacher,
ask for some evidence of his knowledge before you enroll as his student.
If he seeks financial aid to prosecute, or to complete, occult investigations,
require some demonstration of his ability in that direction. No honest
man could object to such requirements. A bank would not lend money to a
man to enlarge his business until he had shown his qualifications to succeed.
And above all, remember this, that laboratory Alchemy is never taught.
It is a matter of individual conquest. It is true that after a student
has shown his persistency and evidenced his character under the trying
circumstances that the novice always encounters in Alchemy, and has acquired
even a crude success, then some experienced ego in the great art will give,
from time to time, the younger student some helpful hints which may aid
him in his quest.
<p>It requires a peculiar type of mind to succeed in this master art. I
do not mean a superior mind, necessarily, but one that is tenacious, patient,
intuitive, and insatiate for knowledge. All Alchemists are Occultists,
but all Occultists are not Alchemists, for many students do not care for
this study. Many prefer art, literature, music, sculpture, mathematics,
mechanics, or some other phase of knowledge, and, in time, become masters
of their selected art or science.
<p>We speak of two kinds of Occultists, the practical and the theoretical;
so there are two kinds of Alchemists, the laboratory Alchemist and the
library Alchemist. The latter claim that all Alchemy is symbolical. This
theory originated in 1850 when an English woman published anonymously a
book entitled "A Suggestive Inquiry Concerning the Hermetic Mystery and
Alchemy, Being an Attempt to Recover the Ancient Experiment of Nature".
Soon it was followed in 1865 by another book to the same effect, by a Mr.
Hitchcock, in America, entitled "Remarks on Alchemy and the Alchemists".
<p>These persons have many followers in both countries today. But for untold
thousands of years all Alchemists, both library and laboratory, asserted
that the science was a material one; and history shows that it gave birth
to both chemistry and physics. The history of Alchemy also shows that at
different periods there were men who acquired great fortunes without any
other means of acquisition except Alchemy and who claimed that the wealth
came through their knowledge of how to transmute baser metals into gold.
This, of course, shows that the hermetic art always has been a physical
science in addition to a philosophy. Dr. Waite in his very entertaining
book. "Lives of Alchemistical Philosophers", has given brief biographies
of many historical Alchemists which confirm this statement.
<p>The medieval Alchemists had to phrase all their hermetic writings in
theological terms for self-protection. This, naturally, led many persons,
who thought in symbols, to believe that Alchemy was mental, or, as they
said, spiritual, rather than material. And such students first study and
then teach Alchemy only as a means of evolutionary unfoldment. A symbolic
mind can use almost any picture, or symbol, on which to hang any philosophy;
and alchemy lends itself readily to symbolic interpretation by reason of
its inherent nature. One of the most prominent leaders of the Theosophical
Movement in Germany once called on me in Chicago to discuss metaphysics.
He demonstrated his conception of Occultism by mathematics, starting with
a point, then a line, and after that, the circle. He had read extensively
and thought deeply, but took this method of demonstrating his conclusions.
<p>It is such minds that claim all Alchemy is symbolic. These people say
they are studying, or teaching, "spiritual" Alchemy. What is spiritual
Alchemy? Many persons are inclined to say a man, or woman, is spiritual
when he, or she, is very thin. If persons are anemic, they are particularly
spiritual; or if they adopt certain diets and reduce their weight, they
are spiritual, or like a spirit, or a ghost. Half of the people in the
world who use the word spirit, or spiritual, have no conception of the
idea behind it. It does not belong to any particular cult, or church, or
to obeying the "thou shalts" and the "thou shalt nots". Nor is it subscribing
to some particular creed, or adopting some theological dogma; nor is it
reading certain books or participating in certain ceremonials. Spirit is
the Universal Mother God, and spiritual is that which has the attributes
of Spirit. What are the attributes of Spirit? Three, and three only ---
Omnipresence, Omniscience, and Omnipotence. An individual could not be
omnipresent, because only Deity, Itself, is that; but a person may be spiritual
just in proportion as he manifests in his life something of omniscience
and omnipotence-something of knowledge and of power. So when they speak
of spiritual Alchemy there is the intimation that it gives knowledge and
power. In this sense they are correct. But as generally used, that term
is intended to convey the idea that Alchemy is never material, but only
philosophical.
<p>The Hermetic Philosophy, or Alchemy, started one hundred and twenty-five
thousand years ago in Lemuria when the Lesser Gods revealed the knowledge
to the most advanced men of that race. It did not commence in Egypt, as
so many persons believe. Before Lemuria sank beneath the waters of the
Pacific, it was carried by the cream of the Lemurians into India where
it has been practiced, by the few, ever since. But it was revealed to the
elect of the Atlanteans, also, who carried the art with them into Northern
Africa just before Atlantis was submerged, and the Egyptians were the heirs
of this knowledge. As India became decadent, the best of the race traveled
westward and met the custodians of Atlantean knowledge, where the knowledge
of the two races was combined.
<p>When intellectual darkness settled on all the nations, Arabia was the
custodian of the sacred fire that kept some knowledge and wisdom in the
world. It is to Arabia, then, that almost all Alchemists gratefully must
look. This should not be taken to mean that there were no Alchemists outside
that country during the Dark Ages, for there have been solitary ones here
and there. The word Alchemy is from the Arabic, "Al" meaning the, and "kimia"
meaning infusion, or elixir; for the primary purpose of most Alchemists
is not to transmute baser metals into gold, but to find the Elixir of Life.
In other periods of history, other names were given to the art; but the
inspiration of the great adventure has always been to control sickness
and death, and all who have gained, their goal have been rewarded, more
or less, by this power.
<p>Metaphysical, or philosophical, Alchemy, under whatever name it may
be designated, contains certain cardinal principles, the first of which
is the unity of the universe, which is one in essence. It is atomic, primarily,
having two aspects, the consciousness and the material sides, the latter
being the vehicle for the former. Out of this essence came, force and substance,
mind and matter, in all their multitudinous manifestations. This primal
essence is represented in the books as mercury; for the Alchemist learned
ages and ages ago, by chemical experiments, that mercury is the mother
of all things and that even life itself is but subconscious mercurial gas
in motion.
<p>The second principle of the philosophy is that there is but one purpose
in the universe-to evolve minds out of consciousness, through many forms,
and to develop the minds thus made into higher and still higher grades.
At times this was taught openly, as evolution through reincarnation, and
at other periods this truth was veiled.
<p>The third great principle of Alchemy was, and is, that this is a universe
of cause and effect. If these cardinal principles are accepted, then every
claim of the Alchemist must be admitted to be at least logical. Some leading
modern scientists have been driven, inch by inch, to accept enough of these
basic propositions to no longer scoff at Alchemy, but to appreciate the
pioneers in that field who laid the foundations for much of our present
knowledge.
<p>Empedocles, the Greek philosopher and alchemist, discovered, or rediscovered,
the four elements and named them. Zosimus, the Theban Alchemist, invented
sulphuric acid; and I might go down the entire list, if we had the time.
But it is enough to say that Geber, the Arabian Alchemist, in the eighth
century, wrote a book entitled "Summit of Perfection," in which he disclosed
the chemical knowledge of the Alchemists of his time. In that book is shown
that those men calcinated, boiled, dissolved, precipitated, sublimated,
and coagulated chemical substances. They worked then, as chemists do now,
with gold, mercury, arsenic, sulphur, salts, and acids. Those Alchemists
maintained then, as the ancients did and the modern ones do, that all metals
are compound bodies having their origin in sulphur, salt, and mercury,
in differing proportions. This book became the textbook in Arabia, and
later, in the colleges in Spain dominated by the Arabian thought and culture.
This book, still later, became the textbook on chemistry for Europe and
the world. Alchemy in its esoteric form, then and later, was conveyed to
students only under signs, symbols, and half-truths, leaving to the patient,
intuitive mind the interpretation of the symbols and the piecing together
of the half-truths into a complete science.
<p>Most of the modern scientists, by reason of their childish conceit,
are still unwilling to admit that the ancients actually accomplished their
undertakings; but feel that the moderns will reach the ideals of the ancient
Alchemists. The Occultist must continue to smile at such vanity, knowing,
as he does, that time will justify, not only the philosophy of Occultism,
but of all the Occult Sciences. This is not intended as a sneer at the
accomplishments of the modern scientists, but as a caution to the intelligent
student not to take too seriously the claims of the present-day scientists
that they have all wisdom and success.
<p>Nothing of basic importance has been discovered this century which does
not confirm the fundamental teachings of Occultism. Take, for illustration,
the theory of the electrical nature of matter and the method of its grouping.
It well deserved the Nobel Prize, for it was a physical demonstration of
the old Alchemistical doctrine, "As in the Macrocosm, so in the Microcosm."
<p>Sir Ernest Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha rays of radium
and produced helium. This is transmutation of matter-done differently by
the ancient Alchemists, buts nevertheless, done. So, too, Dr. Adolph Meithe,
followed by Dr. Kurlbaum, passed electricity through mercurial vapor and
changed a part of it into gold. Professor Nagaoka, of Japan, did the same
thing. In the same year, Arthur Smits and A. Karsen, of Amsterdam, decomposed
lead and turned part of it into gold. Is this not modern Alchemy? Why should
any modern man, scientist or skeptic, presume to say the ancient Alchemists
did not have the knowledge they claimed? Is there but one way-the electrical-to
transmute metals? Paracelsus, in his books on Alchemy, shows seven different
ways to produce the result for gold alone.
<br>Remember what knowledge the ancient Alchemists admittedly contributed
to the world; and then think how they accomplished their results with crude
appliances and primitive chemical aids; and give them their share of credit,
esteeming them, not as pretenders, but as men of honor and of science who
were able to formulate from experiments the propositions which modern science
confirms.
<p>To be a successful student of laboratory Alchemy, one first must acquire
the philosophy of the subject, and then live that philosophy until it transmutes
one's nature and makes it conform to the ideals of the Occultist. This
is not a very easy thing to do, for such ideals are higher than those of
other cults and creeds, by reason of the very nature of the subject and,
the power it confers when success crowns effort.
<p>The Philosopher's Stone is the objective of most students; and when
acquired and intelligently used, it confers physical immortality at will.
This astounding statement is confirmed by my observation; for incredible
as it may appear, I know of one Alchemist more than six hundred years old,
and one whose age is more than four hundred, and another whose age is more
than two hundred years; and all of these look and function as do men in
the prime of life at about forty years. It can be seen from this that if
a man's character is not good, if he is destructive in thought and evil
in intent, he could, in time, through similar natures, organize a hierarchy
of evil which, opposing the good, could delay evolution and limit its constructive
harvest. And so, men of doubtful character are not permitted by Divine
Law to achieve success in the higher realms of Alchemy.
<p>If I had to define Alchemy, I would call it an exposition of nature's
evolutionary processes. For illustration, let us use mercury once more,
because you hear more about that than anything else in Alchemy-unless it
is the making of gold. If you understand one globule of mercury, its nature,
the forces that bind it together, and the chemical essences within it,
it will unlock the entire Universe to you. Mercury is the key of the Universe,
and that is the reason it is so dominant in all books on Alchemy. The man
who breaks down a globule of mercury, to its ultimate, understands how
the world is created. And when he makes the Philosopher's Stone, he becomes
a real creator, for he has made a little world; and the process is identical
in creating a Macrocosm or Universe.
<p>This element is not called mercury always. It had different names in.
different languages. In the time of the Arabians it was frequently called
arsenic, which is not the arsenic of medicine, but another name applied
to mercury.
<p>Alchemy is the mother of all sciences because in it is contained the
story of the creation of the world, the story of the matter, the story
of mind. Were I going to picture it, I would call laboratory Alchemy the
illustration of the philosophy of Alchemy. In other words, it is applied
Metaphysics.
<p>There are two branches of laboratory Alchemy, the metallurgic and the
medical. The metallurgic pertains, of course, to metals. Primarily, it
is the extracting of metals from ores, then extracting the essences from
the metals and, finally, extracting oils from the essences. Those are the
three steps of analytic, metallurgic Alchemy. After one has succeeded in
reducing and finding out the ultimate nature of a metal, then one can reassemble
it. So that part of the science is both analytical and synthetical. But
instead of recreating the same thing, one may break down the metal and
find a number of different elements and may reassemble some of them to
make something else. Alchemists have had that knowledge for many cycles,
and modern science is just beginning to acquire and apply it.
<p>To illustrate: Modern scientists can make gold, although the United
States Bulletin on the subject, shows that it costs more to make that metal
than it is worth. For a long time chemists thought that gold was an element,
but now they have accepted the alchemical statement that gold is a compound.
So, instead of doing as the modern physicist does, putting mercury into
a tube and passing an enormous amount of electricity through it to get
a trace of gold, the Alchemist breaks down base metals and combines their
essences to make the precious metals in commercial quantities. Modern science
expects to do the same, and many of the brightest minds in all nations
are devoting their lives to experiments along this line.
<p>Professor Edwin Walter Kemmerer, of Princeton, Poland's financial savior,
warns that it is time to face the probability of currency chaos caused
by the discovery of synthetic gold. A few years ago, just after the Great
War, newspapers throughout the world were announcing various discoveries
of methods to manufacture the precious metal; and many nations feared that
the Alchemists of Germany would succeed in making gold in such large quantities
that they could pay their war debts with the manufactured, but depreciated
metal.
<p>The chemists of England gave a new turn recently to transmutation when
they asserted that they were trying to change gold into tin and into copper,
because the world's supply of gold seemed unlimited, while that of tin
and of copper would be exhausted within one hundred years. This viewpoint
is characteristic of England, because tin is an English product. But that
nation does not take into consideration that the Andes Mountains of South
America may supply all English deficiency in tin and copper and all other
metals so necessary to the needs of future generations. Or, if our English
chemists would concede for a moment that the Alchemists might have some
knowledge, they would find in Paracelsus' books a process for transmuting
iron into copper.
<p>But nature has her own way of keeping her secrets which she reveals
to those only who serve her in her own way; and so the modern Alchemists
can afford to smile at the efforts of the modern scientists to transmute
metals commercially, knowing that throughout the ages other bright minds
have made similar efforts and failed. In fact, many of the present day
chemists and physicists are in the same egos who in other lives made unsuccessful
efforts in the same direction. And they will not succeed until they conquer
their egotism and imitate nature as the Alchemists do.
<p>It is not only in regard to precious metals that Alchemists flatter
nature by imitation; they break down metals, extract their oils, and reassemble
their atoms as semi-precious stones and as jewels and gems. There was not
a crowned head in Europe which did not wear jewels made by Count St. Germain,
for he was liberal with his presents to royalty, with whom he was a great
favorite. The best that modern chemists have been able to do is to make
small synthetic jewels. Every one knows of the synthetic rubies and emeralds
of the present day. Some are very well done and only experts can detect
the false from the true. The modern chemist is less fortunate in making
diamonds, producing only very small ones. The handsomest jewels in India
today were never taken out of the ground; they are the products of ancient
and modern Alchemists.
<p>On this part of Alchemy, the things I have said I know, not from my
own knowledge, but from hearsay -- from other Alchemists and from Occult
books and records. Mrs. Ingalese and I, so far, have only taken up the
second branch of laboratory Alchemy -- medical Alchemy.
<p>In this connection, I have a word of explanation to offer in behalf
of the nature of this lecture. For forty years Mrs. Ingalese and I have
shared with the world some of our experiences and knowledge through our
lectures and books. We have tried always to keep our personalities in the
background, as our works show. But, the very nature of this lecture and
its purpose require that for once I must break this lifetime rule, for
otherwise this lecture would be useless. My purpose in giving it is to
add the testimony of Mrs. Ingalese and myself to the truth of the claims
of the Alchemist as far as our own experiences have gone. Those learned
men have been grossly maligned during the Nineteenth Century and until
the third decade of the present one. The only concession made now by the
wise (? ) men of the present time is that "the theories of the Alchemists
were probably correct, but they never realized their dreams." And this
statement is reiterated in books, lectures, and classrooms, without the
least evidence to support its later portion. On the contrary, tradition
and circumstantial evidence all confirm the claims of the ancients.
<p>Our experience and our testimony are as follows: For years we thirsted
for the knowledge of how to cure disease and to prolong life. We knew that
a strong mind in a strong body is essential to this purpose, and therefore
we studied the theories of every prominent school of medicine, and many
of those not prominent. None of these held out fulfillments of our hopes.
The nearest approach to our ideal was the Occult School of Medicine. For
seven years we studied in this School, that being the time required to
complete the course; and we were well rewarded for our efforts, though
we were not taught how to prolong life indefinitely, or how to renew youth.
But we were taught how to cure disease with herbal remedies and with the
mind and Cosmic Forces. To save answering innumerable questions concerning
this School, let me say that Occult Medicine, like all the other Occult
Sciences, is not taught in a school building situated in any particular
place, but by graduates of the system who received their knowledge from
an individual teacher and who transmit, in the manner in which they received
them, the teaching "from mouth to ear."
<br>No one is accepted as a pupil in this School who has not studied Occult
Philosophy for at least a period of seven years, and who has not, in a
great measure, lived what lie has learned. The teacher, alone, is the judge
of the qualifications of a pupil, and comes to him when, from an evolutionary
viewpoint, he is ready to be taught-the life and the mental desire of the
pupil attract the teacher.
<p>Our study of Occultism and of Occult Medicine naturally brought us in
contact with the literature of Alchemy. It was the one system that seemed
to offer our hearts desire. Our other work and our situation in life were
such that we could not essay the Hermetic Art at that time. And so we commenced
to collect manuscripts and books on the subject and to save our money for
the great adventure. This was continued for more 'than a decade. We learned
all we could about the art, through literature and inquiry; but during
those years, we deferred the attempt to try out the theories practically.
But we made up our minds which branch of the subject we finally would essay.
<p>We ascertained from the books that it was first requisite to study metallurgic
Alchemy in order to know how to reduce metals for their oils. To illustrate:
A globule of mercury is fluidic. The first thing a metallurgist does is
to remove its metallic covering so as to "fix" its contents. Then the "fixed"
portion is reduced to powder, which, in turn, is again reduced to an essence,
and from that is extracted an oil. This oil is then crystallized, after
which it is ready for Alchemical experiments. All this is much easier described
than done, but it was necessary for us to have a definite idea of what
we desired to do to accomplish our purpose, and the works of Paracelsus
gave us this information. Some one has said, "You can destroy all other
books on Alchemy, for their knowledge and more is contained in the Alchemical
writings of Paracelsus."
<p>In 1911 we determined to put our conception of the teachings of Paracelsus
to laboratory tests and commenced our experiments. Our quest was the Philosopher's
Stone, and not the transmutation of metals. We had to learn, however, the
analytical side of metallurgic Alchemy, but went no further in that direction.
We never have made gold, nor gems. That is a branch which is exceedingly
interesting; and when we have the leisure, we shall pursue that part of
the art. But we have seen and talked with those who claimed success in
that branch, and, knowing their characters as we do, we have no reason
to question their statements; besides which, modern science confirms the
possibility, and our studies show the probability. But we are not convinced
that the process is profitable. It is a question which looms large whether
the time, money, and incessant labor devoted to this branch of the work
would not produce larger monetary returns in some other field of endeavor.
We are rather inclined to believe they would. But for the sake of knowledge,
we will some day master that branch of the arts.
<p>After we established our laboratory and commenced our experiments, it
did not take us long to find that we had enlisted, not only in a difficult
study, but in a very expensive one; and that our income would be overtaxed
to meet the requirements. It was therefore agreed that I should return
to the practice of law to supplement our resources and that Mrs. Ingalese
should pursue the experiments. There have been women Alchemists in the
past who have assisted their respective husbands in the work, but I believe
Mrs. Ingalese was the first women to take the initiative in the art; and
to her goes all the credit of the pioneer for the four long years of solitary
effort and for the final discovery of how to make the stone. My part was
to produce the means to carry on the work, to consult with my wife and
to encourage her in the hours of disappointment and despair; and, later,
first to assist in the work, and then to relieve her of the toil of bringing
her results to perfection.
<p>The essential theory of the Alchemists is that all metals have oils
and these oils are the spirits, or virtues, of the metals. That was the
first principle which confronted us, and, necessarily, it was true or false.
The examination of the textbooks on chemistry failed to disclose information
on this subject: Interviews with prominent chemists brought denial of this
theory; but I could not reconcile their denial with the fact that petroleum
products seemed to indicate otherwise. I was told that such products were
the results of animals or vegetable deposits; but learned by later investigation
that this theory of science was incorrect, as is the theory that coal and
its oils are derived from the vegetable world, but we were confronted with
the fact that either chemistry, or Alchemy, was mistaken, and we had to
determine the truth for ourselves.
<p>As oil of gold was one of the four elements of the Philosopher's Stone-according
to the books-we naturally commenced to reduce gold. But gold at two hundred
and forty dollars a pound is an expensive thing to experiment with; and,
after a while it dawned on us that the principle would be the same if we
used copper at fifteen cents a pound. So the experiments were transferred
to the cheaper metal.
<p>Three long, weary, heart-breaking years were devoted to the pursuit
for the red oil of copper, with never a ray of light to bless the labor
or to encourage hope. Nothing but dogged determination held us to our purpose.
One night, a telephone message from my wife to come home at once as she
had "it" which to us, of course, meant the oil. All speed limits were broken
reaching home, and Mrs. Ingalese exhibited to me a brown substance that
was hardening fast. She pronounced it the red oil of copper.
<p>At the commencement of our endeavors, we had agreed that we would try
never to deceive ourselves and would not hesitate to say what we honestly
thought, because the easiest thing in the world is to believe what one
wants to believe. Hard as it was, I had to say "That liquid is neither
red, nor is it an oil, but it is greasy". She replied, "When I phoned you,
it was a red oil; but it has hardened and oxidized".
<p>So there was nothing to do but to try again; and after another experiment
she produced the oil of copper. When we had that, we no longer cared what
chemistry taught, nor what chemists believed. The laboratory had told us
that the Alchemists were right.
<p>I closed my office then, resigned from all my clubs, stopped lecturing
and writing and all social duties and pleasures, and devoted my time to
work in the laboratory with my wife. We thought that victory was close
at hand, but found that it was still some years away. The fifth year gave
us the oil of sulphur; but not until we had many fires and explosions and
two asphyxiations. The sixth year produced the oil of mercury, the basis
of all Alchemy. By this time we had sold all our securities and had two
mortgages on our home, but had determined to continue with the work until
we met with success, if it took this life and all subsequent ones. But
we had all the oils required to make the Stone, and, thus encouraged, we
tried to crystallize and fuse them.
<p>In 1917 we succeeded in making the White Stone of the Philosophers.
It looked like soft, white marble, and its effect upon the body was startling.
We dared not try it on ourselves at first. But there was a third member
of our family, a beautiful Angora cat of which we were very fond. We took
a vote to see which of the three should test out that Stone, and the cat,
neglecting to vote, was elected. It survived the first dose, and we repeated
it on the two following days, with the cat becoming more frisky than usual.
After that we tried it ourselves, each. taking a dose at the same moment
so we would excarnate together if it should prove fatal. But it proved
beneficial and energized our bodies.
<p>Shortly after that event, the wife of a prominent local physician died;
and the doctor, knowing of our experiments and that the books claimed that
such a Stone, if used within a reasonable time, would raise the dead, asked
us to experiment on the body of his wife. Half an hour had elapsed since
her death and her body was growing cold. A dose of the dissolved White
Stone was put into the mouth of the corpse without perceptible result.
Fifteen minutes afterward a second dose was administered and the heart
commenced to pulsate weakly. Fifteen minutes later a third dose was given
and soon the woman opened her eyes. In the course of a few weeks, the patient
became convalescent, after which she lived seven years.
<p>Encouraged by this success, we redoubled our efforts to make the Red
Stone of the Philosophers, which is the one most mentioned in Alchemical
writings. This effort was continuous from 1917 to 1920, when our quest
was rewarded. True, the product was crude, but it answered to every test
of a newly-made Stone; but it was so crude we were unable to retain the
first dose and had to refine it by months of labor before it became suitable
even for a weak medicine.
<p>Afterwards, we commenced to take the Red Stone regularly twice a week.
The dose, in size, was about as large as an uncooked grain of rice; in
Troy weight, less than half a grain. The dose was very small, yet almost
from the first, the results were wonderful, and, during a series of years,
quite miraculous.
<p>As I have remarked before, nothing is quite so easy as self-deception
and to preclude this possibility, we had a number of friends, including
two physicians, to check the effect of the Stone upon our bodies. For many
months, the symptoms were all subjective, such as renewed strength and
greater endurance. Then the effects were quite patent to an observer; as,
increased circulation of the blood, stronger heart, better color, greater
number of red corpuscles, and other physical manifestations.
<p>There were several elderly people whom we were under obligations to
help in case our search proved successful, and we offered to share the
results of our efforts with them; but, being wisely cautious, they preferred
to wait until we had tried out the Stone for a year. After that, -our renewal
club was formed and we all took the magic medicine. We called our group
"The Renewal Club" because the books promised that the Red Stone, if persistently
used for years, would renew and restore the physical body to the perfection
of manhood, or womanhood. Seven years have passed, and all the members
of the group -- except one -- are manifesting this truth in their bodies.
The one member excepted was more than eighty years of age when she commenced
the treatment. Her body was diseased; she did not follow the directions;
and she finally died from the action of drugs, given to her by her dentist,
which produced coma-kidney disease being one of her complications.
<p>At first the action of the medicine upon our group was very slow because
the Stone was weak; but as time passed, its power increased with each elevation,
until in January 1926, it was perfected for medical purposes. Mrs. Ingalese
and I have not done as well as some of the other members of the group because
of the condition we were in when we commenced the treatment. From 1911
to 1920, though having the knowledge and the means to keep our bodies healthful
we did not use mind or any medicine in that behalf because, otherwise,
we could not have known what effect the Alchemical products would have
on us.
<p>From a physiological viewpoint, those were important years in our lives,
since our bodies had reached an age when strict attention and care were
necessary to prevent quick deterioration. But, even under those conditions,
our bodies now attest the power of the Stone, as all who have known us
for the last two decades can testify.
<p>The books, or manuscripts, claim that the Red Stone of the Philosophers
will cure any illness, and that after one has taken it for five years one
cannot contract any disease.
<p>We desired to test the truth of that statement and tried the Stone on
many "incurables." The number of cases cured was remarkable, but we found
it not infallible. Aside from personal benefit, the one reason we entered
upon the great quest was to know the truth about medical Alchemy, which
I would summarize as follows:
<p>The Alchemists who wrote on the subject usually did so within a period
of a few years after obtaining the Stone. The marvelous work done by it,
for themselves and others, stimulated their enthusiasm and warped their
judgment. A careful observation over a greater number of years and a larger
number of cases would have made them more accurate. These good men had
no intention to deceive, but they spoke, or wrote, too soon.
<p>Mrs. Ingalese and I both know that if the Stone is administered to a
young, or a matured, person in normal health, it will prevent old age;
that if given to a healthy but aged person, it stops further physical deterioration
and starts him backward toward youth. From testimony of creditable witnesses
and corroborative evidence, we believe that such cases reach perfected
manhood and remain there at the will of the possessor of the Stone. So,
physical immortality and perpetual youth are realities, and not dreams.
<p>We know that the Stone restores virility in men at any age, and normal
desire in both sexes. If a woman has recently passed her change of life,
it restores all normal functions of the sex organs. But, if she has long
passed that period, then, childbearing is out of the question.
<p>The Stone is an aid in acute diseases, but cannot be relied upon alone
to cure since its action is too slow. In chronic cases, where there are
no complications and fair vitality, its action is certain in any disease;
where there are complications and low vitality, other aids are advisable.
Of course I am assuming in the foregoing statements that the person using
the Stone also exercises common sense in regard to eating, drinking, sleep
and work. If one disregards all laws of hygiene and misuses mind and body,
then one must take the consequences of one's thoughts and acts; for there
is no vicarious atonement either in medicine or in morals. If a person
desires longevity and youth, he must obey the rules in the Chapter on Immortality
in "The Greater Mysteries."
<p>It was the implicit faith in the power of the Stone to cure all disease,
under every circumstance, that caused their more conservative and wiser
brothers to use all aids to restore health, and then utilize the Stone
to perpetuate life, health, and youth, for centuries.
<p>I have been asked often if it were not the mind, or faith, of the patient
which produced the marvelous results in the cases we have observed. I answer,
"NO," because some of them did not know what they were taking, and others
did not believe in its power but took it as a "forlorn hope."
<p>This is our testimony in behalf of Alchemy and the Alchemists, which
each person may accept, or reject, according to his conviction, until such
time as our bodies, now sixty-five and seventy-three years of age, respectively,
by their youth and vigor, will compel acceptance of our statements.
