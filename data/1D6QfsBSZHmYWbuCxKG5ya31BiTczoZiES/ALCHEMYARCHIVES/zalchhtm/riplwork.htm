<blockquote>Take Heavy, Soft, Cold, and Drye;
<br>Clense him, and to Calx grind him subtily:
<br>Dissolve him in Water of the Wood;
<br>If thou can do any good
<br>Thereof, take a Tincture
<br>And Earthly Calx good and pure.
<br>Of this maist thou have with thy travaile,
<br>Both Mercury, Water, and Oyle;
<br>Out of the Ayre with Flames great,
<br>Fire into the Earth doth Creepe;
<br>In this Worke if thou wilt winn,
<br>Take heed wherewith thou dost begin,
<br>And in what manner thou dost work,
<br>For loosing thy way in the darke;
<br>And where, with what, and how, thy matter shal end;
<br>I tell and Councell thee as my Frend:
<br>Make Water of Earth, and Earth of Water;
<br>Then art thou well onward in the matter.
<br>For thou shalt find hid in the myre,
<br>Both Earth, Water, Ayre, and Fire:
<br>I tell thee my Brother, I will not flatter,
<br>Of our Earth is made our Water:
<br>The which is cleere white as Snow;
<br>And makes our Earth Calcine and growe.
<br>Blackness first to thee doth shew,
<br>As by thy practise thou shalt know:
<br>Dissolve and Calcine, oft, and oft;
<br>With Congelation till the Body to whitnes be brought:
<br>Make the Body fluxible, and flowing;
<br>With the Earth, perfect, and teyning.
<br>Then after Ferment is once done;
<br>Whither thou wilt with Sunne or Moone,
<br>Dissolve him with the Water of life,
<br>Ycalled Mercury withouten strife:
<br>Put the Soule with the Body, and Spirite
<br>Together in one that they may meete
<br>In his Dammes belly till he wax great,
<br>With giving Drinke of his owne sweate:
<br>For the Milke of a Cow to a Child my brother
<br>Is not so sweete as the Milke of his Mother:
<br>This Child that is so marveilously wrought,
<br>Unto his Heritage must be brought:
<br>His livelyhood is so worthy a thing,
<br>Of abilitye to spend with a King:
<br>He that beareth all this in minde,
<br>And understandeth these Parables all;
<br>With Seperation he may finde,
<br>Poore and Rich, great and small;
<br>With our Sulphur we make our Antimony, White and Red;
<br>And thereof we make our Mercury quick, and dead.
<br>This is a Mettall that I speake of one of the seaven,
<br>If thou be a Clerk read what I meane.
<br>There is no Plannet of six neither great nor small,
<br>But if he be put to them, he will Calcine them all.
<br>Unto red blood he must be brought;
<br>Else of him thou gettest right nought:
<br>Reach him then with the Wood Water,
<br>Man, and Woman Clothed under one hatter,
<br>In and of them is conceived a Child
<br>Lovely of beauty, meeke and mild;
<br>Out of the Earth with dropps stronge,
<br>Nourish the Child in his Mothers wombe;
<br>Till he be come to full age;
<br>And then make thou a Mariage,
<br>Betweene the Daughter, and the Sonne,
<br>And then thou hast the Mastery wonn.
<br>The beginning of this Worke, if thou wilt crave,
<br>In holly Writ thou shalt it have:
<br>Both in Masse Booke and in Psalter
<br>Yea wrighten before the Preest at the Alter:
<br>And what is Antimony that thou shalt worke,
<br>I have written to thee if thou be a Clerke;
<br>Looke about before if thou canst finde
<br>Plainely written, which maketh men blind:
<br>Our Werke is bringing againe our Mercury,
<br>And that Philosophers call Solucion;
<br>And if thou loose not the uncleane body,
<br>Thou werkest without discretion;
<br>The Inbibition of Water, is not the loosing;
<br>But bringing the Body into water againe turning:
<br>That is to say into such water,
<br>That is turning the Body into his first Matter:
<br>The second Werke is to bring,
<br>Earth and Water to Congealing;
<br>The cleansing of the Third is another
<br>Unto Whiteness; my owne Brother;
<br>With this Water of his owne,
<br>That is full marvalous to be knowne:
<br>The fourth werke is distilling
<br>Of Water, and Earth upsweating.
<br>And thus hast thou by one assent,
<br>Earth, Ayre, Water, and Fire; the foure Elements:
<br>The Ashes that are in the bottome of the Vessell,
<br>Looke thou dispise them not though left,
<br>For I tell thee right well,
<br>There is the Diadem of our Craft.</blockquote>
