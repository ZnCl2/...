<p><br>
<br>
<p><b>Upon all genuine Seekers of the great Chemical Art, or Sons of Hermes,
the Author implores the Divine Blessing and Salvations.</b>
<p>When I considered in my mind the great number of deceitful books and
forged Alchemistic "receipts", which have been put in circulation by heartless
impostors, though they do not contain even a spark of truth --- and how
many persons have been and are still daily led astray by them? -- it occurred
to me that I could not do better than communicate the Talent committed
to me by the Father of Lights to the Sons and Heirs of Knowledge. I also
wish to let posterity see that in our own age, as well as in ancient times,
this singularly gracious philosophical Blessing has not been denied to
a few favoured men. For certain reasons I do not think it advisable to
publish my name; chiefly, because I do not seek for praise for myself,
but am only anxious to assist the lovers of philosophy. The vainglorious
desire for fame I leave to those who are content to seem what they, in
reality, are not. The facts and deductions which I have here briefly set
down are transcribed from that manual --- experience, graciously bestowed
upon me by the Most High; and my object is to enable those who have laid
a sound foundation in the elementary part of this most noble Art, to advance
to a more satisfying fullness of knowledge, and to put them on their guard
against those depraved "vendors of smoke," who delight in fraud and imposition.
Our science is not a dream, as the vulgar crowd imagines, or the empty
invention of idle men, as the foolish suppose. It is the very truth of
philosophy itself, which the voice of conscience and of love bid me conceal
no longer. In these wicked days, indeed, when virtue and vice are accounted
alike, the ingratitude and unbelief of men keep our Art from appearing
openly before the public gaze. Yet this glorious truth is even now capable
of being apprehended by learned and unlearned persons of virtuous lives,
and there are many persons of all nations now living who have beheld Diana
unveiled. But as many, either from ignorance or from a desire to conceal
their knowledge, are daily teaching and inducing others to believe that
the soul of gold can be extracted, and then imparted to other substances;
and thereby entice numbers to incur great waste of time, labour, and money:
let the sons of Hermes know for certain that the extracting of the essence
of gold is a mere fond delusion, as those who persist in it will be taught
to their cost by experience, the only arbitress from whose judgment seat
there is no appeal. If, on the other hand, a person is able to transmute
the smallest piece of metal (with or without gain) into genuine gold or
silver which abides all the usual tests, he may justly be said to have
opened the gates of Nature, and cleared the way for profounder and more
advanced study. It is with this object that I dedicate the following pages,
which embody the results of my experience, to the sons of knowledge, that
by a careful study of the working of Nature they may be enabled to lift
the veil, and enter her inmost sanctuary. To this final goal of our sacred
philosophy they must travel by the royal road which Nature herself has
marked out for them. Let me therefore admonish the gentle reader that my
meaning is to be apprehended not so much from the outward husk of my words,
as from the inward spirit of Nature. If this warning is neglected, he may
spend his time, labour, and money in vain. Let him consider that this mystery
is for vise men, and not for fools. The inward meaning of our philosophy
will be unintelligible to vainglorious boasters, to conceited mockers,
and to men who smother the clamorous voice of conscience with the insolence
of a wicked life; as also to those ignorant persons who have fondly staked
their happiness on albefactions and rubrefactions and other equally senseless
methods. The right understanding of our Art is by the gift of God, or by
the ocular demonstration of a teacher, and can be attained only by diligent,
humble search, and prayerful dependence on the Giver of all good things;
now, God rejects those who ho hate Him and scorn knowledge. In conclusion,
I would earnestly ask the sons of knowledge to accept this Book in the
spirit in which it was it was written; and when the HIDDEN has become MANIFEST
to them and the inner gates of secret knowledge are flung open not to reveal
this mastery to any unworthy person; also to remember their duty towards
their suffering and distressed neighbours to avoid any ostentatious display
of their power; and above all, to render to God, the Three in One, sincere
and grateful thanks with their lips, in the silence of their hearts, and
by refraining from any abuse of the Gift.

<p><b>Simplicity is the Seal of Truth</b></center>

<p>As after the completion of the preface it was found that it did not
cover the whole of the space allotted to it, I have, at the publisher's
request, there set down the "last will and testament of Arnold Villanovanus"
which I once turned into Latin verse. I am conscious that the style of
my versification is wanting in neatness and elegance; but this defect was
partly caused by the necessity of adhering strictly and faithfully to the
Author's meaning. Testament of Arnold de Villanova
<p>It is said that Arnold de Villanova a man who was as a credit to his
race, signified his last will in the following words:
<p>"It has its birth in the earth, its strength it doth acquire in the
fire, and there becomes the true Stone of the ancient Sages. Let it be
nourished for twice six hours with a clear liquid until its limbs begin
to expand and grow apace. Then let it be placed in a dry and moderately
warm spot for another period of twelve hours, until it has purged itself
by giving out a thick steam or vapour, and becomes solid and hard within.
The 'virgin's milk ' that is expressed from the better part of the Stone
is then preserved in a carefully closed oval-shaped distilling vessel of
glass, and is day by day wondrously changed by the quickening fire, until
all the different colours resolve themselves into a fixed gentle splendour
of a white radiance, which soon, under the continued genial influence of
the fire, changes to a glorious purple, the outward and visible sign of
the final perfection of your work."

<p><b><font size=+1>The First Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Of Nature, What She Is, and What Manner of Men Her
Disciples Ought to Be</font></b></center>

<p>Many Sages, Scholars, and learned men have in all ages, and (according
to Hermes) even so early as the days before the Flood, written much concerning
the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone; and if their books could be
understood without a knowledge of the living processes of Nature, one might
almost say that they are calculated to supersede the study of the real
world around us. But though they never departed from the simple ways of
Nature they have something to teach us, which, in these more sophisticated
times, still need to learn, because we have applied ourselves to what are
regarded as the more advanced branches of knowledge, and despise the study
of so "simple " a thing as natural Generation. Hence we pay more heed to
impossible things than to those objects which are broadly exhibited before
our very eyes, we excel more in subtle speculations than in a sober study
of Nature, and of the meaning of the Sages. It is one of the most remarkable
features of human nature that we neglect those things which seem familiar,
and are eager for new and strange information. The workman who has attained
the highest degree of excellence in his Art, neglects it, and applies himself
to something else, or else abuses his knowledge. Our longing for an increase
of knowledge urges us ever onward towards some final goal, in which we
imagine that we shall find full rest and satisfaction, like the ant which
is not endowed with wings till the last days of its life. In our time,
the Philosophical Art has become a very subtle matter; it is the craft
of the goldsmith compared with that of the humble workman who exercises
his calling at the forge. We have made such mighty strides in advance that
if the ancient Masters of our science, Hermes and Geber and Raymond Lullius,
were to rise from the dead, they would be treated by our modern Alchemists
not as Sages but as only humble learners. They would seem very poor scholars
in our modern lore of futile distillations, circulations, calcinations
and in all the other countless operations wherewith modern research has
so famously enriched our Art though without understanding the sense of
the ancient writings. In all these respects, our learning is vastly superior
to theirs. Only one thing is unfortunately wanting to us which they possessed,
namely, the knack they had of actually preparing the Philosopher's Stone.
Perhaps, then, their simple methods were after all the best; and it is
on this supposition that I desire, in this volume, to teach you to understand
Nature so that our vain imaginations may not misdirect us in the true and
simple way. Nature then, is one, true, simple, self-contained, created
by God and informed with a certain universal spirit. Its end and origin
are God. Its unity is also found in God, because God made all things. Nature
is the one source of all things: nor is anything in the world outside Nature,
or contrary to Nature. Nature is divided into four "places" in which she
brings forth all things that appear and that are in the shade; and according
to the good or bad quality of the "place" she brings forth good or bad
things. There are only four qualities which are in all things and yet do
not agree among themselves, as one is always striving to obtain the mastery
over the rest. Nature is not visible, though she acts visibly; she is a
volatile spirit who manifests herself in material shapes, and her existence
is in the Will of God. Students of Nature should be such as is Nature herself
--- true, simple, patient, constant, and so on; above all, they should
fear God, and love their neighbors. They should always be ready to learn
from Nature and to be guided by her methods, ascertaining by visible and
sensible examples whether that which they propose to perform is in accordance
with her possibilities. If we would reproduce something already accomplished
by Nature, we follow her, but if we would improve on her performance, we
must know in and by what it is ameliorated. For instance, if we desire
to impart to a metal greater excellence than Nature has given to it, we
must take the metallic substance both in its male and its female varieties,
else all our efforts will be in vain. It is as impossible to produce a
metal out of a plant, It is most important for us to know her "places"
and those which are most in harmony and most closely allied, in order that
we may join things together according to Nature, and not attempt to confound
vegetables with animals, or animals with metals. Everything should be made
to act on that which is like to it --- and then Nature will perform her
duty. as to make a tree out of a dog or any other animal.

<p><b><font size=+1>Second Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Operation of Nature in our Substance,
and its Seed</font></b></center>

<p>I have already said that Nature is one, true, and consistent, and that
she is known by her products, such as trees, herbs, &amp;c. I have also
described the qualifications of a student of Nature. Now I will say a few
words about the operation of Nature. As Nature has her being in the Will
of God, so her will, or seed is in the Elements. She is one, and produces
different things but only through the mediate instrumentality of seed.
For Nature performs whatsoever the sperm requires of her, and is, as it
were only the instrument of some artisan. The seed if anything is more
useful to the artist than Nature herself; for Nature: for Nature without
seed is, what a goldsmith is without silver and gold, or a husbandman without
seed corn. Wherever there is seed, Nature will work through it, whether
it be good or bad. Nature works on "seed" as God works on the free will
of man. Truly it is a great marvel to behold Nature obeying the seed not
because she is forced to do so but of her own will. In like manner, God
permits man to do what hat he pleases not because He is constrained but
of His good and free bounty. The seed, then, is the elixir or of anything,
or its quintessence, or its most perfect digestion and decoction, or, again,
the Balm of Sulphur, which is the same as the radical moisture in metals.
We might say much more about this seed, but can only mention those facts
which are of importance in our Art. The four elements produce seed, through
the will of God and the imagination of Nature; and as the seed of the male
animal has its centre or storing place in the kidneys, so the four elements
by their continual action project a constant supply of seed to the centre
of the earth, where it is digested, and whence it proceeds again in generative
motions. Now the centre of the earth is a certain void place wherein nothing
is at rest; and upon the margin or circumference of this centre the four
elements project their qualities. As the male seed is emitted into the
womb of the female, where only so much as is needed is retained while the
rest is driven out again, so the magnetic force of our earth-centre attracts
to itself as much as is needed of the cognate seminal substance, while
that which cannot be used for vital generation is thrust forth in the shape
of stones and other rubbish. This is the fountain-head of all things terrestrial.
Let us illustrate the matter by supposing a glass of water to be set in
the middle of a table, round the margin of which are placed little heaps
of salt, and of powders of different colours. If the water be poured out,
it will run all over the table in divergent rivulets, and will become salt
where it touches the salt, red where it dissolves the red powder, and so
on. The water does not change the "places," but the several places differentiate
the water. In the same way, the seed which is the product of the four elements
is projected in all directions from the earth-centre, and produces different
things, according to the quality of the different places. Thus, while the
seed of all things is one, it is made to generate a great variety of things,
just as the seed of a man might produce a man if projected into the womb
of a female of his own species, or a monstrous variety of abortions, if
projected into the wombs of different female animals. So long as Nature's
seed remains in the centre it can indifferently produce a tree or a metal,
a herb or a stone, and in like manner according to the purity of the place,
it will produce what is less or more pure. But how do the elements generate
the sperm or seed ? There are four elements, two heavy and two light, two
dry and two moist, but one driest and one moistest of all; and these are
male and female. By God's will each of these is constantly striving to
produce things like to itself in its own sphere. Moreover they are constantly
acting on one another, and the subtle essences of all are combined in the
centre, where they are well mixed and sent forth again by Archeus, the
servant of Nature, as is more fully set forth in the Epilogue of these
twelve Treatises.

<p><b><font size=+1>Third Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the True and First Matter of Metals</font></b></center>

<p>The first matter of metals is twofold, and one without the other cannot
create a metal. The first and principal substance is the moisture of air
mingled with warmth. This substance the Sages have called Mercury, and
in the philosophical sea it is governed by the rays of the Sun and the
Moon. The second substance is the dry heat of the earth, which is called
Sulphur. But as this substance has always been kept a great mystery, let
us declare it more fully, and especially its weight, ignorance of which
mars the whole work. The right substance, if the quantity of it which is
taken be wrong, can produce nothing but an abortion. There are some who
take the entire body for their matter, that is, for their seed or sperm;
others take only a part of it: both are on the wrong track. If any one,
for instance, were to attempt the creation of a man out of a man's hand
and a woman's foot, he would fail. For there is in every body a central
atom, or vital point of the seed (its 1/8200 part), even in a grain of
wheat. Neither the body nor the grain is all seed, but every body has a
small seminal spark, which the other parts protect from all excess of heat
and cold. If you have ears and eyes treasure up this fact, and be on your
guard against those who would use the whole grain as seed, and those who
strive to produce a highly rarefied metallic substance by the vain solution
and mixture of different metals. For even the purest metals contain a certain
element of impurity, while in the inferior the proportion is greater. You
will have all you want if you find the point of Nature, which you must
not, however, look for in the vulgar metals; it is not to be found therein,
for all these, and common gold more especially, are dead. But the metals
which we advise you to take are living and have vital spirits. Fire is
the life of metals while they are still in their ore, and the fire of smelting
is their death. But the first matter of metals as a certain moisture mixed
with warm air. Its appearance is that of oily water adhering to all pure
and impure things; yet in some places it is found more abundantly than
in others because the earth is more open and porous in one place than in
another, and has a greater magnetic force. When it becomes manifest, it
is clothed in a certain vesture, especially in places where it has nothing
to cling to. It is known by the fact that it is composed of three principles;
but, as a metallic substance it is only one without any visible sign of
conjunction, except that which may be called its vesture or shadow namely,
sulphur, &amp;c.

<p><b><font size=+1>Fourth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>How Metals are Produced in the Bowels in the Earth</font></b></center>

<p>The metals are produced in this way: after the four elements have projected
their power and virtues to the centre of the earth, they are, in the hands
of the Archeus of Nature distilled and sublimed by the heat of perpetual
motion towards the surface of the earth. For the earth is porous, and the
air by distillation through the pores of the earth is resolved into a water
out of which all things are generated. You should know that the seed of
metals is the same, in the first instance, as the sperm of all other things,
viz., a vaporous moisture. Hence it is foolish to seek the dissolution
of metals in the first matter, which is nothing but a vapour, and in so
doing philosophers have not comprehended the first matter, but only the
second, as Bernard Trevisan well argues, though in a somewhat obscure manner,
for he addressed himself to the Sons of the Doctrine. For my part before
openly explaining this theory, I would warn all men not to seek that which
exists everywhere by itself in a soft volatile form by so many circulations,
calcinations, and reiterations of hard gold and silver, which can never
be changed back into their original substance. Let us follow the real meaning
of the writers of Alchemy whose works we read, and remember that if Art
would produce any solid and permanent effect, it must follow in the footsteps
of Nature, and be guided by her methods. It must trust itself to the guidance
of Nature as far as Nature will lead, and go beyond her by still adhering
to her rules. Now I said that all things are produced of a liquid air or
a vapour which the elements distil into the centre of the earth by a continual
motion, and that as soon as the Archeus has received it, his wisdom sublimes
it through the pores, and distributes it to each place, producing different
things according to the diverse places in which it is deposited. Some think
that each metal has its own seed. But this is a great mistake for there
is only one Seed. The sperm which appears in Saturn is the same as that
which is found in gold, silver, copper, &amp;c.; their difference is caused
by the place, and by the time during which Nature was at work upon them,
the procreation of silver being achieved sooner than that of gold, and
so with the other metals. The vapour which is sublimed by heat from the
centre of the earth, passes either through cold or warm places. If the
place be warm and pure, and contain adhering to it a certain fatness of
sulphur, the vapour (or Mercury of the Sages) joins itself to its fatness,
and sublimes it together with itself. If in the course of its further sublimation
this unctuous vapour reaches other places where the earth has already been
subtilized, purified, and rendered moist by previous ascending vapours,
it fills the pores of this earth, and with it becomes gold. But if this
unctuous moisture be carried to impure and cold places, it becomes lead;
if the earth be pure and mingled with sulphur, it becomes copper. For the
purer the place is, the more beautiful and perfect will the metal be. We
must also note that the vapour is constantly ascending, and in its ascent
from the earth's centre to its superficies, it purifies the places through
which it passes. Hence precious metals are found now where none existed
a thousand years ago, for this vapour, by its continual progress, ever
subtilizes the crude and impure, and as continually carries away the pure
with itself. This is the circulation and reiteration of Nature. All places
are being more and more purified: and the purer they become the nobler
are their products. In the winter this unctuous vapor is congealed by the
frost. At the return of spring it is set free, and is the Magnesia which
attracts to itself the kindred Mercury of the air, and gives life to all
things through the rays of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, thus bringing
forth grass, flowers, and the like, for Nature is never idle Even during
a single moment. This then, is the only true account of the generation
of Metals. The earth is purged by a long distillation, and when the unctuous
or fatty vapour approaches, the same are procreated, nor are they ever
otherwise begotten notwithstanding the imaginations of those who misinterpret
on this point the writings of the philosophers.

<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Fifth Tract</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>On the Generation of All Kinds of Stones</font></b></center>

<p>The substance of stones is the same as that of all other things; and
their quality is determined by the purity of the places in which they arise
when the four elements distil their vapour to the centre of the earth,
the Archeus of Nature expels and sublimes it in such a manner that it carries
with it in its passage through the pores of the earth, all the impurities
of these places up to the surface, where they are congealed by the air,
all that pure air engenders being congealed by crude air, their ingression
being mutual, so that they join one with another, since Nature rejoices
in Nature. Thus rocks and stones are gradually built up and generated.
Now the larger the pores of the earth, the greater is the quantity of impurities
carried upward; and thus the earth is most completely purified under those
places where there is a great accumulation of stones or rocks at the surface,
and in this manner the procreation of metals becomes easier in these places.
This explains the fact that metals are scarcely ever found in plains, but
nearly always in the bowels of rocky hills. The plains are often moist
with elemental water which attracts to itself the rising vapour, and with
it is digested by the rays of the Sun into the rich clay which potters
use. In places where the soil is gross, and the vapour contains neither
unctuousness nor sulphur, it produces herbs and grass in the meadows. The
precious stones, such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, chrysopras, onyx,
and carbuncle, are all generated in the same manner as ordinary stones.
When the natural vapour is sublimed by itself without sulphur or the unctuosity
of which we have spoken and reaches a place where there is pure salt water
(i.e., in very cold places, where our sulphur cannot exist, for could it
exist, this effect would be hindered), diamonds are formed. The unctuous
sulphur which rises with the vapour cannot move without warmth and is instantly
congealed. When it reaches a slightly cold place, leaving the vapour to
continue its upward movement without it. Colours are imparted to precious
stones in this way. When the unctuous sulphur is congealed by the perpetual
motion, the spirit of the water digests it in passing and purifies it by
the water of the salt, until it assumes a red or white colour. This colour
is volatilized by so many repeated distillations, and at length is borne
upward with the purifying vapour, which by its aid is able to enter imperfect
bodies, and thus to pervade them with colour; the colour is united to the
partly congealed water and fills all its pores so that the two are absolutely
one. For water which has no spirit is congealed by heat, and water which
has a spirit is congealed by cold; but he who knows how to congeal water
by means of heat, and to join to it a spirit, is like to discover something
a thousand times more precious than gold, or anything which is in the world.
Let him separate the spirit from the waters in order that it may putrefy,
and that the grain may appear. Then let him purge off the dross, and reduce
the spirit to water. This union will produce a branch which bears little
resemblance to the parent stem.

<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Sixth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Second Matter and Putrefaction</font></b></center>

<p>We have spoken of the first matter of all things, and after what manner
they are born by Nature without seed, that is, after what manner Nature
receives the matter from the elements whereof she engenders seed. We will
now consider this seed and the things evolved from it. Everything that
has seed is multiplied thereby, but not without the aid of Nature for seed
is nothing but congealed air, or a vaporous humour enclosed in a body;
and unless it be dissolved by a warm vapour, it cannot work. Now, the nature
of this seed which is produced out of the four elements, is threefold:
it is either Mineral, or Vegetable, or Animal. Mineral seed is known only
to the Sages. Vegetable seed is common and vulgar, as we see in fruits.
Animal seed is known by imagination. But vegetable seed exhibits most clearly
the process by which Nature evolves natural objects out of the four elements.
Winter is the cause of putrefaction: it congeals the vital spirit in trees,
and when the heat of the Sun, which magnetically attracts moisture, sets
it free, the natural heat (of the tree) which is thereby stirred up, drives
a subtle vapour of water towards the surface, and makes the sap to flow,
always separating the pure from the impure, though the impure may sometimes
precede the pure. That which is pure is congealed into flowers, the impure
becomes leaves, the gross and thick hardens into bark. The bark of the
tree remains fixed; the leaves fall when the pores are obstructed by heat
or cold; the flowers receive a colour according to the quality of the natural
heat, and bear fruit or seed. We may instance the apple, wherein is the
sperm, whence the tree does not spring; but in this sperm is the seed or
grain interiorly, whence the tree is born even without sperm, for multiplication
is not of the sperm but of the seed. Thus we see how Nature, without our
help, creates vegetable seed out of the four elements. But how about Minerals?
Nature brings forth Mineral or Metallic seed in the bowels of the earth.
This is the reason why so many will not believe in its existence -- because
it is invisible. And on this account the vulgar unbelief is not so greatly
to be wondered at: for if they hardly understand that which is openly before
their eyes, how should they know anything about that which they cannot
see. Yet, whether they believe it or not, the fact remains the same, and
it is most true that which is above is as that which is below, and that
which is born above has origin from the same source which is at work down
below, even in the bowels of the earth. What prerogative have vegetables
above metals that God should give seed to the one and withhold it from
the other? Are not metals as much in His sight as trees? It is certain
that nothing can grow without seed; for that which has no seed, is dead.
The four elements must either bring forth metallic seed or produce metals
without seed. In the latter case, they cannot be perfect: for nothing is
complete without seed. He who can bring himself to believe that metals
are destitute of seed, is unworthy to understand the mysteries of our Art.
The metals then really contain their own proper seed; and it is generated
in the following way. The vapour which (in the manner repeatedly described
rises from the earth's centre, and is called Mercury not on account of
its essence but on account of its fluidity, and the facility with which
it adheres to anything, is assimilated to the sulphur on account of its
internal heat; and, after congelation, is the radical humour. Thus metals
are indeed generated out of mercury; but those ignorant persons who say
that this first substance of metals is ordinary mercury, confound the whole
hole body with the seed that is in it, seeing that common mercury, too,
contains metallic seed, as well as the other metals. Let us illustrate
the matter by the analogy of the human body. Therein it is certain that
there is a seed whereby the species of mankind is propagated. That body
(which may be likened to common mercury) contains seed, which is not seen,
and of which the quantity is very small in proportion to the size of the
whole body: the process of generation is performed not by the whole body,
but by this seminal "congealed watery vapour." But as no vital generation
could take place if the body were dissected in order to get at the seed,
as the murdering of the body would kill the seed -- so ignorant Alchemists
may be said to murder the body and kill the seed of metals, when they dissolve
their bodies, whether of gold, silver, or lead, and corrode them with aqua
fortis, in order to obtain the metallic seed. All multiplication is performed
by means of male and female seed; and the two (which by themselves are
barren) must be conjoined in order to bring forth fruit, i.e., a new form.
Whosoever, therefore, would bring forth any good thing must take the sperm
or the seed, and not the entire body. Take, then, the living male and the
living female, and join them in order that they may project a sperm for
the procreation of a fruit according to their kind, for let no one presume
to suppose that he can make the first matter. The first matter of man is
earth, and there is no one so bold as to dream that he can create a man.
God alone can perform this artifice. But if the second substance (or seed)
which is already created, be put in the proper place, Nature will produce
a new form of the same species. The Artist only separates what is subtle
from its grosser elements, and puts it into the proper "vessel." Nature
does the rest. As a thing begins, so it ends. Out of one arise two, and
out of two one -- as of God the Father there was begotten God the Son,
and from the two proceeded God the Holy Ghost. Thus was the world made,
and so also shall it end. Consider carefully these few points, and you
will find, firstly the Father, then the Father and the Son, lastly, the
Holy Spirit. You will find the four elements, the four luminaries, the
two celestials, the two centrics. In a word there is nothing, has been,
and shall be nothing in the World which is otherwise than it appears in
this symbol, and a volume might be filled with its mysteries. I say, therefore,
it is the attribute of God alone to make one out of one, you must produce
one thing out of two by natural generation. Know, then, that the multiplying
sperm is the second substance, and not the first. For the first substance
of things is not seen, but is hidden in Nature or the elements: the second
substance is occasionally seen by the children of knowledge.

<p><b><font size=+1>Seventh Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Virtue of the Second Matter</font></b></center>

<p>But in order that you may the better know this second matter, I will
describe to you its virtues. Nature is divided into three kingdoms, the
mineral, the vegetable, and the animal. It is manifest that the mineral
kingdom could subsist of itself were there no vegetables or animals in
the world; the vegetable in like manner, is independent of the animal and
mineral. These two kingdoms were created in independence. The animal kingdom
alone depends for its subsistence on the two others, and is the most noble
and excellent of all; and seeing that it is the last of the three, it governs
the two others, because virtue expends itself at the third, even as it
is multiplied in the second. In the vegetable kingdom the first substance
is the herb or the tree, which you cannot create, but which is produced
by Nature alone. The second substance is the seed which you see, by which
herbs and trees are propagated. In the animal kingdom the first substance
is the beast or man, whom you cannot create; but the seed, or second substance,
by which they are propagated, you know. In the mineral kingdom, too, you
are unable to create a metal, and if you boast that you can do so, Nature
will laugh at your pretensions; given even the possession of that first
matter which is vaunted by the philosophers, namely, the centric salt,
you cannot multiple it without gold; but the vegetable seed of metals is
known only to the Sons of Science. In the case of plants, the seed is seen
outwardly, and is digested by warm air. In animals the seed appears inwardly
and outwardly, and is prepared in the kidneys of the male. Water is the
seed of minerals, in the very centre of their heart and life; and the "kidneys
of its digestion" are fire. The receptacle of vegetable seed is the earth;
the receptacle of animal seed the womb of the female; and air is the receptacle
of water -- the mineral seed. The receptacles of seed are the same as congelations
of
bodies; digestion is the same as solution, and putrefaction the same as
destruction. The specific property of seed is to enter into union with
other substances belonging to the same kingdom, because it is subtle, and,
in fact, air congealed by fatness into water. It is recognizable by the
fact that it does not become naturally united to anything outside the kingdom
to which it belongs. It is not dissolved, but only congealed, as it does
not need solution but only congelation. Hence it is necessary that the
pores of bodies be opened to admit the sperm, in the centre of which lies
the seed (which is air). When it enters its proper womb it is congealed,
and congeals the pure or mixed substance which it finds. So long as there
is any seed in the body the body lives; when it is all consumed the body
dies; and any emission of seed weakens the body, as may be seen in the
case of dissolute persons, and of trees which have been too richly laden
with fruit. The seed, then, is invisible, but the sperm can be seen, and
is even as a living soul, which is not found in dead things. It is extracted
after two manners, of which the first is gentle and the second violent.
Nothing is produced without seed, but everything comes into being by means
of seed. Let all sons of knowledge remember that seed is vainly sought
in dry trees, and that it is found only in those which are green.

<p><b><font size=+1>Eighth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>How Nature Operates Through Our Art in the Seed</font></b></center>

<p>Seed in itself produces no fruit, if it be not placed by Nature or Art
in its own proper womb. Though seed in itself is the most glorious of all
created things, yet the womb is its life, which causes the putrefaction
of the enclosing grain or sperm, brings about the congelation of the vital
atom, nourishing and stimulating its growth by the warmth of its own body.
All this is constantly and regularly being enacted (by months, years, and
seasons) in the above said three natural kingdoms. The process can be hastened
artificially in the vegetable and mineral, but not in the animal world.
In the mineral kingdom, Art can do something which Nature is unable to
perform, by removing the crude air which stops up the outward pores of
minerals, not in the bowels of the earth but in the circumference. The
elements vie in projecting their seed into the centre of the earth in order
that it may there be digested. The centre, by a caloric movement, emits
it into the womb; of these wombs there are an untold number -- as many
as there are places, and one place always purer than another. Know that
a pure womb will bring forth a pure form of its own species. For instance,
as among animals there are wombs of women, cows, mares, bitches, so in
the mineral world there are metals, stones, and salts. Now salts principally
demand consideration, with their localities, according as they are less
or more important.

<p><b><font size=+1>Ninth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>On the Commixtion of Metals, and the Eliciting of the
Metallic Seed</font></b></center>

<p>We have spoken hitherto of Nature, of Art, of bodies, sperm and seed.
Let us now proceed to the practical enquiry, how metals should be mixed,
and how they are mutually related. For as a woman is generated in the same
womb, and out of the same seed as a man, and the only difference is in
the degree of digestion, and the purity of the blood and salts, so silver
is produced from the same seed, and in the same womb as gold; but the womb
of the silver had more water, and, as it were less digested blood than
that of gold, according to the times of the celestial moon. But if you
would understand the sexual union of the metals and their manner of emitting
and receiving seed look at the celestial bodies of the planets. You will
see that Saturn is higher than all the rest, to whom Jupiter succeeds,
then Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, while the last place is occupied by
the Moon. The virtues of the planets descend, but do not ascend; and so
as experiences teaches us, Mars is easily converted into Venus, but not
Venus into Mars, which has an inferior sphere. Also Jupiter may be quickly
transmuted into Mercury, because Jupiter has a higher place; the one is
second after the firmament, the other second after the earth. Saturn is
the highest, the Moon lowest; the Sun combines with all, but is never ameliorated
by its inferiors. There is a great correspondence between Saturn and the
Moon, the Sun being medial between them; as also between Mercury and Jupiter,
Mars and Venus, which all have the Sun as their centre. Most operators
know how to transmute iron into copper, or Venus, without using gold, they
also know how to change Jupiter into Mercury some can prepare the Moon
(silver) out of Saturn; but if they could prepare gold by these changes,
their secret would be worth knowing indeed. For this reason I repeat that
it is important to know the mutual correspondence of metals, and their
possibilities of union. There is one metal which has power to consume all
others, for it is, so to speak, their water, and almost their mother, and
is resisted only by the radical humour of gold and silver, and ameliorated
by it. This metal is called Chalybs (steel). If gold is united to it eleven
times, and emits its seed, it is weakened even unto death; but the Chalybs
(steel) conceives and brings forth a son much nobler than the father; and
when the seed of the son is placed in her womb it purifies it, and renders
it a thousand times better fitted to produce excellent fruit. There is
another Chalybs (steel) which is like this one, and created as a thing
by itself by Nature. This steel is able, with its wonderful virtue, to
elicit from the rays of the "sun" that which so many have sought, and which
is the chief principle of our Art.

<p><b><font size=+1>Tenth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>On the Supernatural Generation of the Son of the Sun</font></b></center>

<p>We have treated of those things which are produced by Nature and have
been created by God, so that those who are searchers of this science man
comprehend more easily the possibility of Nature, and the utmost limit
of her powers. I now go on to speak about the method of preparing the Philosophers
Stone. The Stone or Tincture is nothing other than gold digested to the
highest degree. Common gold resembles a plant without seed; but when such
a plant is matured, it produces seed-and so, when gold is ripened, it produces
its seed, or the Tincture. If any one asks why gold and other metals do
not commonly produce seed I answer because the crudity of the ore, which
has not sufficient heat, prevents it from being matured. In some places
pure gold is found which Nature has been striving to mature, but which
has not attained to ripeness on account of the crudity of the air. An analogous
case is that of the orange tree, which bears no fruit in northern latitudes,
because it has not sufficient warmth, while in warmer countries it ripens
the most delicious fruit, and a like result it is possible to produce in
colder countries, by means of artificial heat. The same thing happens with
metallic natures, and so gold may be made to produce seed, by a wise and
judicious Artist who knows how to assist Nature. Should he act independently
of Nature, he would err, for in this science, as in all others, we can
do nothing but supplement Nature, nor can we otherwise aid her than through
the agency of heat or fire. Now, in order that Nature may be enabled to
work upon a congealed metallic substance, wherein the spirit does not appear,
the body must be dissolved and its pores opened. Now there are two kinds
of solution, the violent and the natural; and under the former head come
all those methods of solution which are in vogue among the vulgar herd
of modern Alchemists, and the same are cold and useless. Natural solution
takes place when the pores of the body are gently opened in our water,
so that the digested seed can be emitted and placed in its womb. Our water
is a water which does not wet the hands; it is a heavenly water, and yet
not rain water. The "Body" is gold, which gives out the seed. Our silver
(not common silver) is that which conceives the seed of the gold. There
it is digested by our continual fire, for seven or even ten months, until
our water consumes three, and leaves one; and this is something twofold.
Then it is nourished with the milk of earth, or the fatness of that which
is formed in the breasts of the earth, and is regulated and conserved by
the putrefaction of the surrounding substance. In this way that infant
of the second generation is born. Now us advance from theory to practice.

<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Eleventh Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Practical Preparation of Our Stone or
Tincture by Means of Our Art</font></b></center>

<p>Our discourse in preceding chapters has been enlarged by appropriate
examples which well facilitate the understanding of the practice, which,
in accordance with natural procedure, must be performed as follows: take
eleven grains of our earth, by as many doses, one grain of our gold, and
two grains of our silver. Here you should carefully bear in mind that common
gold and silver are of no use for our purpose, as they are dead. Those
which I ask you to take are the living metals. Expose them to the heat
of our fire, and there will come out of them a dry liquid. The earth will
first be dissolved into a water which is called Mercury of the Sages, and
this water will dissolve the bodies of the gold and silver, and consume
them, till only the tenth part with one part remains, which is the radical
metallic humour. Then take the water of saltpetre from our earth, in which
is a living river and a flowing wave. Let this water be clear, and pour
on it the radical humour: expose the whole to the fire of putrefaction
and generation, which is not the same as that of the first operation. Regulate
the heat judiciously, until there appear colours like those of the Peacock's
Tail, and then continue to apply this well-regulated heat until the colours
resolve themselves into a pronounced green. Be not weary but continue till
the rest of the colours have manifested. When you observe at the bottom
ashes of a brown colour, while the water is almost red, you should open
the vessel and dip a feather into it. With this feather smear a morsel
of iron, and if it becomes tinged, pour into the vessel as much of a certain
water (which we will describe hereafter) as there is of crude air which
has entered in, and then again subject it to coction over the same fire,
until it colours the feather again. Further than this my experience does
not go. The water I have mentioned is the menstruum of the world from the
sphere of the Moon and so carefully rectified that it has power to calcine
the Sun. Herein have I desired to discourse everything to your understanding
and if sometimes you will take my meaning rather than my words, you will
find that I have revealed all, more especially as regards the first and
second work. It remains for me to say a few words about the fire. In the
first operation the fire should be of one degree and continuous and should
pervade the whole substance with an even warmth. In the second operation
we need a natural fire, which digests and fixes the substance. Behold,
I say unto you the truth! I have unfolded the regimen of the fire if only
you understand Nature. But it is needful also to speak a few words concerning
the vessel, which ought to be such as is indicated by Nature; and two of
these vessels suffice. In the first operation the vessel should be round;
in the second it should be somewhat smaller; it should also be of glass
in the form of a vial or egg. But, know, above all things, that fire employed
by Nature is one and its differences are determined by differences of distance.
The vessel of Nature is also one, but we use two in order to accelerate
the development of our substance; its material is one, but consists of
two substances. If you would produce anything, look at the things that
are produced. If you cannot understand those which are continually before
your eyes, it will go hardly with you when you seek to produce those which
are as yet unseen. Remember that God alone can create; but He has permitted
the Sage to make manifest things that are hidden and concealed according
to the ministry of Nature. Consider I pray you the simple water of the
clouds. Who would believe that it contains in itself all mundane objects,
hard stones, salts, air, earth, and fire? What shall I say of the earth,
which seems simple enough and, and contains water, fire, salts, air, and
much besides? O, admirable Nature, who knowest by the means of water how
to produce the wonderful fruits of earth, who dost give life to them and
nourish them by means of air! Everything depends upon the faculty of seeing
which we bring to the study of nature. Common eyes, for instance, discern
that the sun is hot; the eyes of the Sage see that the sun itself is cold
and that it is only its movements which produce heat for; its effect is
felt at so great a distance in space. The heat of the sun is the same as
our natural fire; for as the sun is the centre of the planets and thence
scatters its heat downward in all directions, so in the centre of the earth
there is a sun of the earth, which by its perpetual motion drives heat
or rays upward towards the surface of the earth. This inward heat is much
more powerful than elemental fire but it is tempered and cooled by the
water which pervades and refreshes the pores of the earth; otherwise all
things would be consumed by its fierceness. In the same way, the fierce
rays of the sun are tempered and assuaged by the air of the intermediate
atmosphere, without which everything would be consumed, and no generation
would be possible. But I must now proceed to explain after what manner
the elements act upon each other. In the centre of the earth, then, there
is a central sun, of which the heat pervades the whole earth to its surface
by reason of the movement thereof, or by the motion of the firmament thereof.
This heat changes the water of the earth into air (or vapour), which being
much more subtle than water, is violently driven upward through the pores
of the earth. But when it reaches the colder atmosphere it is once more
condensed into water and in some places we do indeed see this water or
condensed, air driven highly up into the air by the force of the central
fire: just as a kettle of water when exposed to gentle heat sends upward
a gentle stream of vapour and air, while the steam thickens and the upward
movement becomes more intense when the fire is kindled into a blaze. By
this action of the "central sun" the elements are distributed over the
earth and each finds the place where in can grow. This upward current of
air is not always noticeable because in many places there is not enough
water to make it perceptible: an empty kettle gives out no steam I say,
then, that fire or heat is the cause of the motion of the air, and the
life of all things; and the earth is their nurse, or receptacle. If our
earth and air were not cooled by water, the earth would be parched up,
as it is even now in some places where the pores of the earth are closed
up, and be obstructing the movement of the water would be placed at the
mercy of the two kinds of solar heat. In this way the destruction of the
world will one day be brought about. Now in our Art you should closely
imitate these natural processes. There should be the Central Heat, the
change of the water into air, the driving upward of the air, its diffusion
through the pores of the earth, its reappearance as condensed but volatilized
water. Then you must give our Ancient One gold and silver to swallow and
consume, till he himself is burnt to death and his ashes are scattered
into the water, which you must then subject to coction for a sufficient
space of time. The result will be the Medicine which is a cure for leprosy.
But be careful not to take heat for cold, or cold for heat. Mix only things
which are like each other, and separate contrary elements by means of heat.
If you do not follow the guidance of Nature all your efforts will be in
vain. I swear by God that I have spoken to you as a father should to his
son. He that hath ears, let him hear, and he that hath sense, let him understand.

<p><b><font size=+1>Twelfth Treatise</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Stone and its Virtue</font></b></center>

<p>We have spoken sufficiently in preceding chapters concerning the production
of natural things, the elements, the first and second matters, bodies and
seeds, as also of their use and virtue. I have written also of the Philosophical
Stone, and shall now speak of its virtue, in so far as experience has discovered
it to me. Before, however, I proceed to describe the virtues of the Stone,
I will, for the better understanding of our Art, once more recapitulate
what has already been said. If any one doubts the reality of our Art, he
should read the books of those ancient Sages whose good faith no one ever
yet called in question, and whose right to speak on this subject cannot
be challenged. If you will not believe them, I am not so foolish as to
enter into a controversy with one who denies first principles: the deaf
and dumb cannot speak. Why minerals alone should be excluded from God's
primal benediction, when He bade all things increase and multiply after
their kind, I am unable to see; and if minerals have seed they have it
for the purpose of generic propagation. The Art of Alchemy is true in its
nature. Nature is true also, but a true Artist is rarely found. Nature
is one, our Art is one but the workmen are many. Nature, then, generates
things through the Will of God out of the first Matter (the product of
the elements) which is known to God alone. Nature produces things, and
multiplies them out of the second substance which is known to the Sages.
All elements are mutually dependent, though they do not agree when joined,
but the queen of all is water, because it is the mother of all things --and
over it broods the spirit of fire. When fire acts on water, and strives
with it, the first matter is evolved. Thus arise vapours of sufficient
denseness to combine with earth, by means of that crude air which from
the very beginning was separated from it. This process is going on ceaselessly,
by means of perpetual motion. For motion causes heat, as you may know by
continued friction of any substance. Motion causes heat, heat moves the
water; the motion of water produces air, which is the life of all living
things. Thus all things grow out of water, out of its more subtle vapours
are produced light and subtle things; out of its "oil," things of greater
weight; out of its salt things far more beautiful and precious than the
rest. But as Nature is often hindered by the impurity of this vapour, fatness,
and salt, from producing perfection, experience has taught us to separate
the pure from the impure. Therefore, if you would ameliorate Nature, and
produce a more perfect and elaborated subject, purge the body by dissolution
of all that is heterogeneous, and unite the pure to the pure, the well-digested
to the well-digested, and the crude to the crude, according to the natural
and not the material weight. For you must know that the central saltpetre
never contains more earth than is required whether it be otherwise pure
or impure. But it is different with the fatness of the water, which is
never found pure. Art purges it by the action of twofold heat, and then
again combines its elements.

<p><b><font size=+1>Epilogue</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>or Conclusion of These Twelve Treatises</font></b></center>

<p>I have composed, O friendly reader, the preceding twelve treatises for
the benefit of the students of this Art; in order that they might understand
the operations of Nature, and after what manner she produces all things
which are in the world, before they put their hands to any experiment.
Otherwise, they might be trying to open the gate without a key, or to draw
water with a sieve. For in regard to our Holy and Blessed Art, he for whom
the sun shines not, walks in thick darkness, and he who does not see the
light of the moon, is involved in the shades of night. Nature has her own
light, which is not visible to the outward eyes. The shadow of Nature upon
our eyes is the body. But where the light of Nature irradiates the mind,
this mist is cleared away from the eyes, all difficulties are overcome,
and things are seen in their very essence, namely, the inmost heart of
our Magnesia, which corresponds to the respective centres of the Sun and
Earth. The bodily nature of things is a concealing outward vesture. If
you dressed a boy and a girl of twelve years of age in exactly the same
way, you would be puzzled to tell which was the boy and which the girl,
but when the clothes are removed they may easily be distinguished. In the
same way, our understanding makes a shadow to the shadow of Nature, for
our human nature is concealed by the body in the same way as the body by
the clothes. I might in this place discourse fully and philosophically
of the dignity of man, of his creation and generation but I will pass over
these themes and touch briefly on his life alone. Man is made of earth,
and lives through air; for air contains the hidden food of life, of which
the invisible spirit, when congealed is better than the whole hole world.
Truly wonderful and admirable are the ways of Nature, who shews to us day
by day the light of truth. I have set down in these twelve Treatises that
which she has revealed to me in order that the God-fearing reader may more
easily understand that which I have seen with my eyes, that which my hands
have performed, without any fraud or sophistication. For without the light
and knowledge of Nature it is impossible to attain to the perfection of
this Art, unless it be revealed to a man by the Spirit, or secretly by
a loving friend. The substance is vile and yet most precious. Take ten
parts of our air; one part of living gold or living silver; put all this
into your vessel; subject the air to coction untiit becomes first water
and then something which is not water. If you do not know how to do this
and how to cook air, you will go wrong, for herein is the true Matter of
the Philosophers. You must take that which is, but is not seen until the
operator pleases. This is the water of our dew, which is extracted from
the saltpetre of the Sages, by which all things grow, exist, and are nourished,
whose womb is the centre of the celestial and terrestrial sun and moon.
To speak more openly, it is our Magnet, which I have already called our
Chalybs, or steel. Air generates this magnet, the magnet engenders or manifests
our air. Thus Hermes says that its father is the Sun, its mother the Moon,
and that the winds have fostered it in their womb, that is to say, the
salt Alkali (called by the Sages salt of Ammonia, or vegetable salt) is
hidden in the womb of Magnesia. The operation thereof is as follows: ---
You dissolve condensed air, and in it a tenth part of gold; seal it up
and expose it to our fire, until the air is changed into powder and there
will be seen, given the salt of the world, a great variety of colours.
The rest of this process and the method of multiplication you will find
fully set forth in the writings of Lullius, and other of the ancient Sages,
so therefore I do not dwell on them being content to treat only of the
first and second matters. This I have done frankly, and with open heart.
Think not that any man in this world has spoken more fully and clearly
than I have. I have not learnt what I tell you from books, but by the experiment
of my own hands. If you do not understand it at first, or are unable to
accept the truth, accuse not my work, but blame rather yourself, believing
that God will not reveal this secret unto you. Take it, then, in all earnestness,
read and again read it, especially the Epilogue of these twelve Treatises,
and diligently consider the possibilities of Nature, the action of the
elements, and which is chief among them, especially in the rarefaction
of air or water, by which the heavens and the whole world were created.
This I admonish you to do, as a father admonishes a son. Do not wonder
that I have written so many Treatises. I am not in need of books for myself
but was impelled to record my experience by pity towards those who are
wandering astray in the darkness of their own conceits; and though I might
have set forth this secret in few words, I have written at great length
in order to equip you with that knowledge of Nature, without which you
could not hope to succeed in this Art. Do not be put out by the seeming
contradictions with which, in accordance with the custom of the Sages,
I have had to conceal my real meaning a little. There is no rose found
without thorns. Revolve diligently in your mind all that I have said about
the way in which the elements distil the Radical Moisture to the centre
of the earth, and how the terrestrial and centric sun again raises and
sublimes them, by its continual motion, to the surface of the earth. Note
also the correspondence which has been affirmed between the celestial and
the centric Sun for the celestial Sun and Moon have a special power and
a wonderful virtue in distilling upon earth by their rays. For heat is
easily united to heat, and salt to salt. As the central sun has its sea
and crude perceptible water, so the celestial sun has its sea of subtle
and imperceptible water (the atmosphere). On the surface of the earth the
two kinds of rays meet and produce flowers and all things. Then rain receives
its vital force out of the air, and unites it to that of the saltpetre
of the earth. For the saltpetre of the earth is like calcined tartar, and
by its dryness, attracts air to itself --- which air it dissolves into
water. For this saltpetre itself was once air, and has become joined to
the fatness of the earth. The more abundantly the rays of the sun descend,
the greater is the quantity of saltpetre generated, and so also is the
harvest on earth increased. All this does experience daily teach. I have
willed thus to set forth solely for the benefit of the ignorant the correspondences
which exist between all things, and the efficacious virtue of the Sun,
Moon, and Stars. The wise have no need of such instruction. Our substance
is openly displayed before the eyes of all, and yet is not known. Oh, how
marvellous is our heaven, and our water, and our mercury, and our saltpetre
which are in the world sea, and our vegetable, and our fixed and volatile
sulphur, and our dead head, or dregs of our sea, and our water that does
not wet the hands, and without which no mortal can live --- without which
nothing is born or generated in the whole world! It is lightly esteemed
by men, yet no one can do without it: for it is more precious than all
the world beside, and, in short, it is nothing but our pontic-water which
is congealed in the sun and moon and extracted from the sun and moon, by
means of our chalybs (steel) through the skill of the Sages by a philosophical
artifice and in a surprising manner... I did not really intend to publish
this book, for reasons that are named in the preface; but my love for earnest
students of this Art got the better of my caution. So have I sought to
make known my good-will to those who knows me, and manifest unto the initiated
that I am their companion and equal, and that I desire their acquaintance.
I doubt not that there are many persons of good conduct and clear conscience
who possess this great gift of God in secret. I pray and conjure them that
they should preserve even the silence of Harpocrates. Let them be made
wise by my example, and take warning from my dangers. Whenever I have revealed
myself to the great, it has always been to my peril and loss. But by this
work I now shew myself to the Sons of Hermes, while at the same time I
instruct the ignorant, and direct lost seekers into the right path. Let
them know that the secret is here as plainly expounded as it ever will
be. I have kept nothing back except the secret of extracting our "salt
of Ammonia," or " Mercury of the Sages " out of our "sea water," and the
great use to which it is put. If I have not expressed myself very plainly
on these points, it is only because I may not do so. The secret can only
be revealed by God, who knows men's hearts and minds, and He will vouchsafe
this knowledge, in answer to earnest and importunate prayer after a repeated
careful perusal of this Book. The vessel, as I have said, is one, or two
at most will suffice; and if you have knowledge of Nature, a continuous
fire, and the right substance, you ought to succeed. Let me caution you,
in conclusion, not to be led astray by those who waste their time and money
on herbs, animals, stones, and all kinds of minerals but the right ones.
Farewell, good reader, and may you long enjoy the results of my labours,
to the glory of God, the salvation of your soul, and the good of your neighbour.</blockquote>

<center><b><font size=+1>A Preface to the Riddle of the Sages</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Addressed to the Sons of Truth</font></b></center>

<p>Though I have already given unto you, O Children of Science, a full
and exhaustive account of our Art, and of the source of the universal fountain,
so that there seems no further call to say anything, having, in the preceding
Treatises, illustrated the mode of Nature by examples, and declared both
the theory and the practice, so far it is permitted me to do, yet there
may be some of my readers who think that I have expressed myself here and
there in too laconical a fashion. I will therefore once more make known
from beginning to end the entire process, but in the form of a philosophical
enigma, so that you may judge how far I have been permitted to attain by
God. There is an infinite number of books which treat of this Art, but
you will scarce find any which contain a more clear explication of the
truth than is here set down. I have, in the course of my life, met with
a good many who fancied that they had a perfect understanding of the writings
of the Sages; but their subtle style of interpretation was in glaring contrast
with the simplicity of Nature, and they laughed at what they were pleased
to call the rustic crudeness of my remarks. I have also frequently attempted
to explain our Art to others by word of mouth; but though they called themselves
Sages, they would not believe that there is such water in our sea, and
attributed my remarks to temporary insanity. For this reason I am not afraid
that my writings will reveal anything to unworthy persons, as I am persuaded
that it is only by the gift of God that this Art can be understood. If,
indeed, subtlety and mental acuteness were all that is necessary for its
apprehension, I have met with many strong minds, well fitted for the investigation
of such subjects. But I tell you: Be simple, and not overwise, until you
have found the secret. Then you will be obliged to be prudent, and you
will easily be able to compose any number of books, which is doubtless
more simple for him who is in the centre and beholds the thing itself,
than one who is on the circumference only, and can only go by hearsay.
You have a clear description of the matter of all things, but I warn you
that if you would attain to this knowledge you should continue in earnest
prayer to God, and love your neighbour. In the second place, you should
not be ready to imagine all manner of subtleties and refinements of which
Nature knows nothing. Remain rather in the way of her simplicity, for therein
you are far more likely to put your finger on the subject than if you abide
in the midst of subtleties.
<p>In reading my book, do not stick too closely to the letter of my words
but read them side by side with the natural facts which they describe.
You should also from the first fix your eyes steadily on the object of
your search, and the scope and aim of our work. It is much wiser to learn
with your mind and your brain first than by bitter experience afterwards.
The object of your search should be to find a hidden thing from which,
by a marvellous artifice, there is obtained a liquid by whose means gold
is dissolved as gently and naturally as ice is melted in warm water. If
you can find this substance, you have that out of which Nature produced
gold, and though all metals and all things are derived from it, yet it
takes most kindly to gold. For all other things are clogged with impurity,
except gold wherein there is no uncleanness, whence in a special manner
this matter is, as it were, the mother of gold. If you will not follow
my instructions, and be warned by my cautions, you can derive no benefit
from my book. I have spoken as plainly as my conscience would permit. If
you ask who I am: I am a Cosmopolitan. If you know me, and wish to be good
and honourable men, keep my name a secret. If you do not know me forbear
to enquire after my name, for I shall make public nothing more than appears
in this writing. Believe me, if my rank and station were not what they
are, I should enjoy nothing so much as a solitary life, or to have joined
Diogenes in his tub. For I behold this world full of vanity, greed, cruelty,
venality, and iniquity; and I rejoice in the prospect of the glorious life
to come. I no longer wonder, as once I did, that the true Sage, though
he owns the Stone, does not care to prolong his life; for he daily sees
heaven before his eyes, as you see your face in a glass. When God gives
you what you desire, you will believe me, and not make yourself known to
the world.

<br><b><font size=+1>Enigma of the Sages</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Added by Way of an Appendix</font></b></center>

<p>Once upon a time, when I had been for many years of my life sailing
from the Arctic to he Antarctic Pole, I was cast ashore by the will of
God, on the coast of a certain great ocean; and though I was well acquainted
with the properties of that sea, I did not know whether there was generated
near those shores that little fish Edieneis, which is so anxiously sought,
even unto this present, by men of high and low degree. But as I watched
the Naiads and Nymphs disporting themselves in the water, being fatigued
with my previous toils, and overwhelmed by the multitude of my thoughts,
I was lulled asleep by the soft murmur of the waves; and as I slept sweetly
and gently, I beheld a marvellous vision I saw ancient Neptune, with a
trident in his hand, rise, with venerable aspect, from our sea, who after
a friendly salutation, carried me to a most beautiful island. This island
was situated in the southern hemisphere, and contained all that is required
for man's use and delight. It appeared a more pleasant and delightful abode
than Virgil's Elysian fields. The shores thereof were fringed with verdant
myrtles and cypresses. The meadows were studded with a large variety of
beautiful and fragrant flowers. The slopes of the hills were clad with
vines, olives, and cedars. The roads were overhung by the intertwining
branches of laurels and pomegranate trees, which afforded grateful shade
to the wayfarer. The plains were covered with groves of orange and lemon
trees. In short, the island was an epitome of earthly beauty. Concealed
under a rock, Neptune shewed me two minerals of that island, gold and chalybs
(steel). Then I was conducted to an orchard in the middle of a meadow,
which was at no great distance, the same being planted with a great variety
of beautiful trees. Among these he shewed me seven enriched by particular
names; and two of them towered above the rest. One bore fruit which shone
like the sun, and its leaves resembled gold; the fruit of the other was
whiter than lilies, and its leaves were like fine silver. Neptune called
the first the Solar, and the second he Lunar tree. The only thing which
it was difficult to obtain in the island, was water. The inhabitants had
tried to get it from a spring by means of a conduit, and to elicit it from
many things But the result was a poisonous water, and the only water that
could be drunk was that condensed out of the rays of the sun and moon.
The worst of it was, that no one could attract more than ten parts of this
water. It was wonderful water! I can tell vou; for I saw with my eyes and
touched with my hands its dazzling whiteness, which surpassed all the splendour
of the now. While I stood wrapt in admiration, Neptune vanished from my
sight, and there stood before me a tall man, on whose forehead the name
of Saturn was inscribed. He took a vessel, and scooped up ten parts of
the water, in which he placed fruit from the Solar tree; and the fruit
was consumed like ice in warm water. So I said unto him: "Lord, I behold
here a marvellous thing. This water is small in quantity; nevertheless,
the fruit of this tree is consumed therein by a gentle heat. To what purpose
is all this? "He graciously replied " My son, it is true that this thing
is wonderful. But this water is the water of life, and has such power to
exalt the qualities of this fruit, that it shall afterwards, without sowing
or planting -- only by its fragrance -- transmute the six trees which remain
into its own nature. Moreover, this water is as a woman to the fruit: the
fruits of this tree can putrefy nowhere but in this water; and though the
fruit by itself be wonderful and precious -- yet when it putrefies in this
water, it brings forth out of this putrefaction a Salamander that endures
the fire; its blood is more precious than all treasures, and has power
to render fertile ix trees such as you see here, and to make their fruit
sweeter than honey" Then I said unto him: "Lord, how is this thing done?"
He replied: "I have already told thee that the fruits of the Solar tree
are living, and they are sweet; but whereas the fruit while it is cooked
in this water can inform but one part, after its coction has been completed
it can inform a thousand." I then enquired whether the fruit was boiled
in this water over a fierce fire, and how long? He answered this water
has an inward fire, and when this is assisted by continuous outward warmth,
it burns up three parts of its own body with this body of the fruit, until
nothing but an incredibly small part remains, which, however, possesses
the most marvellous virtue. This is cooked by the wise Master first for
seven months, and then for ten. But in the meantime, on each fiftieth day,
a variety of phenomena is witnessed." Again I besought him whether this
fruit was cooked in several waters and whether anything was added to it.
He made answer: "There is no water, either in this island or in the whole
country but only this kind alone that can properly penetrate the pores
of this fruit; and you should know the Solar tree also grew out of this
water, which is collected by magnetic attraction out of the rays of the
Sun and Moon. Hence the fruit and the water exhibit a wonderful sympathy
and correspondence. If any foreign substance were added to the water, its
virtue would only be impaired. Hence nothing should be put into the water
but this fruit. After its decoction the fruit has life and blood, and its
blood causes all barren trees to bring forth the same precious fruit."
I asked whether the water was obtained by any secret process, or whether
it was to be obtained everywhere? He said: "It is found everywhere, and
no one can live without it, but it is best when extracted by means of our
Chalybs (steel), as which is found in the belly of the Ram. If you ask
what is its use, I answer that before the due amount of coction has been
performed, it is deadly poison, but afterwards it is the Great Medicine,
and yields 29 grains of blood, each one of which produces 864 of the fruits
of the Solar tree." I asked whether it could be still further improved.
"The Sages say," he returned, "that it can be increased first to ten, then
to a hundred, then to a thousand, then to ten thousand times its own quantity,
and so on." I asked whether that water was known by any particular name.
He cried aloud saying: "Few know it, but all have seen it, and see and
love it; it has many names, but we call it the water of our sea the water
that does not wet the hands." "Do they use it for any other purpose?" I
enquired; "and is anything born in it?" "Every created thing," he replied,
"uses it, but invisibly. All things owe their birth to it, and live in
it. Nothing is, properly speaking, in it, though itself mingles with all
things. It can be improved by nothing but the fruit of the Solar trees
without which it is of no use in this work." I was going to ask him to
speak more plainly when he began to cry out in such a loud voice that I
awoke out of my sleep, and Saturn and the hope of getting my questions
answered vanished together. Be contented, nevertheless, with what I have
told you, and be sure that it is impossible to speak more clearly. If you
do not understand what I have said, you will never grasp the writing of
other philosophers. After a while, I fell into another deep sleep, in which
I saw Neptune standing over me, congratulating me on our happy meeting
in the Garden of the Hesperides. He held up to me a mirror, in which I
saw the whole of Nature unveiled. After we had exchanged a few remarks,
I thanked him for conducting me to this beautiful garden, and introducing
me to the company of Saturn; and I heartily besought him to resolve for
me the difficulties and doubts which Saturn had left uncleared. "For instance,"
I said, " I have read and believe that for every act of generation a male
and a female are required; and yet Saturn spoke of generation by placing
the Solar fruit in the water, or Mercury of the Sages. What did he mean?
As the lord of the sea, I know that you are acquainted with these things,
and I entreat of you to answer me." He said, "What you say about the act
of generation is true; and yet you know that worms are produced in a different
way from quadrupeds, namely by putrefaction and the place or earth in which
this putrefaction occurs is feminine. In our substance the Mother is the
water of which so much has been said, and its offspring is produced by
putrefaction, after the manner of worms. Hence the Sages call it the Phoenix
and Salamander. Its generation is a resurrection rather than a birth, and
for this reason it is immortal or indestructible Now, whatsoever is conceived
of two bodies is subject to the law of death; but the life of this fruit
is a separation from all that is corruptible about it. It is the same with
the Phoenix, which separates of itself from its corruptible body." I enquired
whether the substance was compound in its nature. "No," he said, "there
is only the Solar fruit that is put into the water which must be to the
fruit in the proportion of ten to one. Believe that what was here revealed
to you in a dream by Saturn after the manner of our island, is not a dream,
but a bright reality which will stand the test of broad daylight." With
these words he abruptly left me, without listening to my further questions;
and I awoke and found myself at home in Europe. My God shew to you, gentle
reader, the full interpretation of my dreams! Farewell!

<p><b><font size=+1>A Dialogue between Mercury, the Alchemists, and Nature</font></b></center>

<p>On a certain bright morning a number of Alchemists met together in a
meadow, and consulted as to the best way of preparing the Philosopher's
Stone. It was arranged that they should speak in order, and each after
the manner that seemed best to him. Most of them agreed that Mercury was
the first substance. Others said, no, it was sulphur, or something else.
These Alchemists had read the books of the Sages, and hence there was a
decided majority in favour of Mercury, not only as the true first matter,
but in particular as the first matter of metals, since all the philosophers
seemed to cry with one voice: "O our Mercury, our Mercury," &amp;c., whatever
that word might mean. Just as the dispute began to run high, there arose
a violent wind which dispersed the Alchemists into all the different countries
of the world -- and as they had arrived at no conclusion, each one went
on seeking the Philosopher's Stone in his own old way, this one expecting
to find it in one substance, and that in another, so that the search has
continued without intermission even unto this day. One of them, however,
had at least got the idea into his head that Mercury was the substance
of the Stone, and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical
preparation of Mercury saying to himself, for this kind of discourse is
very common among Alchemists, that the assembly had determined nothing,
and that the dispute would end only with the confection of the Stone. So
he began reading the works of the philosophers, and among others that of
Alanus on Mercury, whereby he became a philosopher indeed, but not one
who had reached any practical conclusion. Then he took (common) Mercury
and began to work with it. He placed it in a glass vessel over the fire,
where it, of course, evaporated. So in his ignorance he struck his wife
and said "No one but you has entered my laboratory; you must have taken
my Mercury out of the vessel." The woman, with tears, protested her innocence.
The Alchemist put some more Mercury into the vessel, and kept close and
jealous watch over it, expecting that his wife would once more make away
with it. The Mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam. Then
the Alchemist was full of joy, because he remembered that the first substance
of the Stone is described by the Sages as volatile; and he thought that
now at last he must be on the right track. He now began to subject the
Mercury to all sorts of chemical processes, to sublime it, and to calcine
it with all manner of things, with salts, sulphur, metals, minerals, blood,
hair, aqua fortis, herbs, urine, and vinegar. All these substances were
tried in succession, everything that he could think of was tried; but without
producing the desired effect. Seeing that he had still accomplished nothing,
the poor man once more began to take thought with himself. At last he remembered
reading in some authors that the matter was so contemptible that it is
found on the dung hill; and then he began to operate on his Mercury with
various kinds of dung. When all these experiments turned out failures,
he fell into a deep sleep, and there appeared to him an old man, who elicited
from him the cause of his sadness, and bade him use the pure Mercury of
the Sages. When the Alchemist awoke he pondered over the words of the old
man, and wondered what he could mean by "the Mercury of the Sages". But
he could think of no other Mercury but that known to the common herd, and
went on with his efforts to purge it; for which purpose he used, first,
the excrements of animals, then those of children, and at last his own.
He also went every day to the place where the old man had appeared to him,
in the hope that he might be able to ask him for a more detailed explanation
of his meaning. At times, he would pretend to be asleep; and because he
thought that the old man might be afraid to come to him in his waking hours,
he would swear to him, and say: "Be not afraid to come, old man I am most
certainly asleep. See, my eyes are tightly shut". At length, from always
thinking about that old man, he fell into a fever, and in his delirious
visions he at last saw a phantom in the guise of that ancient standing
at his bedside, and heard him say "Do not despair, my friend. Your mercury
is good, and your substance is good, but it will not obey you. Why do you
not charm the mercury, as serpents are charmed? " With this, the old man
vanished. But the Alchemist arose, with these words still ringing in his
ears: "Serpents are charmed" -- and recollecting that apothecaries ornament
their mercury bottles with images of serpents, he took up the vessel with
the mercury, and repeated the formula of conjuration "ux, ux, ostas," etc.,
substituting the word mercury for the name of the serpent: "And thou mercury,
most nefarious beast." At these words the Mercury began to laugh, and said
to the Alchemist "Why dost thou trouble me, my Lord Alchemist?"
<p><b>Alchemist:</b> Oho, do you call me your lord? Now I have touched
you home. I have found a bit to bridle you with; wait a little, and you
shall soon sing the tune that I bid you (Then as his courage increased,
he cried angrily): I conjure you by the living God -- are you not that
Mercury of the Sages?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> (pretending to speak in a whimpering and frightened
tone of voice): Master, I am Mercury.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Why would you not obey me then ? Why could I not
fix you?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh, most high and mighty Master, I implore you to spare
your miserable slave! I did not know that you were such a potent philosopher.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oh, could you not guess as much from the philosophical
way in which I operated on you?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I did so, most high and mighty Master, but I wished
to hide myself, though now I see that I cannot hide myself from my most
potent Lord.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Then you know a philosopher when you see him, as
you now do, my gallant?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> My most high Lord, I see, and to my own great cost,
that your Worship is a high and mighty and most potent philosopher.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> (with a smile of satisfaction): Now at last I have
found what I sought (To the Mercury, in awful tones of thunder): Now mind
that you obey me, else it will be the worse for you.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Gladly, Master, if I can for I am very weak.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oho, do you begin to make excuses already?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> No, but I am very languid.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What is the matter with you?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> An Alchemist is the matter with me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Are you laughing at me, you false rogue?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh, no, no, Master, as God shall spare me, I spoke
of an Alchemist - you are a philosopher.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Of course, of course, that is quite true. But what
did the Alchemist do?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh Master, he has done me a thousand wrongs; he belaboured
and mixed me up with all manner of disagreeable and contradictory things,
which have stripped me of all my powers and so I am sick, even to death.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> You deserved such treatment, because you would not
obey.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I never yet disobeyed a philosopher, but I cannot help
laughing at fools.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> And what is your opinion of me?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh, Master your Worship is a great man, and mighty
philosopher, greater by far than Hermes, both in doctrine and wisdom.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Well, I won't praise myself, but I certainly am a
learned man. My wife says so, too. She always calls me a profoundly learned
philosopher.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I quite believe you. For philosophers are men whom
too much learning and thought have made mad.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me, what am I to do with you? How am I to make
you into the Philosopher's Stone?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh, my master philosopher, that I cannot tell. You
are a philosopher, I am the philosopher's humble slave. Whatever he wishes
to make me, I become, as far as my nature will allow.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> This is all very fine, but I repeat that you must
tell me how to treat you, and whether you can become the Philosopher's
Stone.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Mr. Philosopher, if you know, you can make it, and
if you don't you can't. From me you cannot learn anything with which you
have been unacquainted beforehand.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> You talk to me as to a simple person. Perhaps you
do not know that I have lived at the courts of great princes, and have
always been regarded as a very profound philosopher.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I readily believe you, my Master for the filth of your
brilliant experiments still cleaves to me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me then, are you the Mercury of the Sages?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I am Mercury, but you should know best, whether I am
the Mercury of you philosophers.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me only whether you are the true Mercury or
whether there is another?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I am Mercury, but there is also another.
<p>With these words the Mercury vanished. The Alchemist shouts and calls
aloud, but there is no answer. At last he is fain to derive some little
comfort from the thought that he has had speech of Mercury and therefore
must be very dear to it. With this thought he once more sets himself to
sublime, distil, calcine, precipitate, and dissolve the Mercury in the
most awful manner, and with different sorts of waters. But his efforts
turned out failures, and mere waste of time. Then he began to curse Mercury
and to blaspheme Nature for creating it. When nature heard this, she called
Mercury to her, and asked him what he had done to the Alchemist, and why
he would not obey him. Mercury humbly protested his innocence. Nature admonished
him to obey the Sons of Knowledge who sought to know her. Mercury promised
that he would do so, but added: "Mother Nature who can satisfy fools?"
Nature smiled, and departed. Mercury indignant with our Alchemist, returned
also to his own place. The philosopher presently appeared with some excrements
of swine, and was proceeding to ply Mercury therewith, when the latter
thus wrathfully accosted him: "What do you want of me, you fool? Why did
you accuse me?"
<p><b>Alchemist:</b> Are you he whom I so much desire to see?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I am; but blind people cannot behold me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I am not blind.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> You are as blind as a new-born puppy. You cannot see
yourself: how then should you be able to see me?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oh, now you are proud and despise me because I speak
humbly. Perhaps you do not know that I have lived at the courts of princes,
and have always been called a philosopher?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> The gates of princes stand wide for fools; and it is
they that fare sumptuously in the palaces of the great. I quite believe
that you have been at court.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> You are, undoubtedly, the Devil, and not a good Mercury,
if you speak like that to philosophers.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Now, in confidence, tell me whether you are acquainted
with any philosophers.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Do you ask this of me, when you are aware that I
am myself a philosopher?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> (smiling): Behold the Philosopher! Well, my philosopher,
what do you seek, and what would your have?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> The Philosopher's Stone.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Of what substance would you make it?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Of our Mercury.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Oh, my philosopher, then I had better go: for I am
not yours!
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> You are none but the Devil, and wish to lead me astray.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Well, my philosopher, I think I may return the compliment:
you have played the very devil with me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oh, what do I hear? This is most certainly the Devil.
For I have done everything most scientifically, according to the writings
of the Sages.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Truly, you are a wonderful operator; your performances
exceed your knowledge by as much as they defy the authorities which you
have in your books. For they say that substances should be mixed only with
substances of a kindred nature. But you have mixed me, against Nature,
with dung and other foul things, and are indifferent about defiling yourself
so long as you can torture me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I do nothing against Nature: I only sow the seed
in its own proper earth, according to the teaching of the Sages.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> You sow me in dung; at the time of the harvest I vanish,
and you reap dung. Verily, you are a good husbandman!
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Yet the Sages say that their substance is found on
the dunghill.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> What they say is true, but you understand only the
letter, and not the spirit of their injunctions.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Now I see that you are perhaps Mercury. But as you
will not obey me, I must once more repeat the words of conjuration: Ux,
ux, ostas ----
<br><b>Mercury:</b> (laughing): It is of no use, my friend; your words
are as profitable as your works.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> They say true when they call you a wonderful and
inconstant and volatile substance.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> You call me inconstant. But to the constant I am also
constant, and to the man of fixed resolve, I am fixed. But you, and the
likes of you, are continually abandoning one substance for another, and
are ever vagabonds in experiment.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me truly, are you the Mercury which, side by
side with sulphur and salt, the philosophers describe as the first principle
of all things, or must I look for some other substance?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> The fruit, when it falls, lies near the tree that bore
it. I am the same that I was except in the matter of age. In the beginning
I was young, and I remained so as long as I was alone. Now, I am old, and
yet I am the same as ever. I am only older than I was.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I am glad that you are old. For it is a constant
and fixed substance that I require, and this also have I invariably sought.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> It is in vain that you come to the old man whom you
did not know as a youth.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What is this you say ? Did I not know you when you
were young? Have I not subjected you to all manner of chemical processes,
and shall I not continue to do so till I have prepared the Philosopher's
Stone?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Woe is me! What shall I do? I already scent the foul
odour of dung. Woe is me! I beseech you Master Philosopher, not to ply
me with excrements of swine -- the foul smell will drive me hence. And
what more do you want of me? Am I not obedient ? Do I not mingle with all
things that you ask me to amalgamate with? Do I not suffer myself to be
sublimated, precipitated, amalgamated, calcined? What more can I do ? I
have submitted to be scourged and spat upon till my miserable plight might
move a heart of stone. I have given you milk, blood, flesh, butter, oil,
and water. I have done all that any metal or mineral can do. And yet you
have no pity on me! Woe is me !
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oho, it does you no harm, you rascal, you deserve
it all richly, for not changing your form, or for resuming the old form
after a mere temporary change!
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I do whatsoever you make me do. If you make me a body,
I am a body. If you make me powder, I am powder. How can I be more obedient
than I am ?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me, then, what you are in your centre, and I
will not torment you any more.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I see there is no escape from speaking fundamentally
to you. If you will, you may now understand me. With my form which you
see you have nothing to do. My centre is the fixed heart of all things,
immortal and all-pervading. I am a faithful servant to my master, and a
faithful friend to my companions, whom I do not desert, and with whom I
perish. I am an immortal body. I die when I am slain, but rise to stand
before the judgment seat of a discriminating judge.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Are you then the Philosopher's Stone?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> My mother is such, and of her is born artificially
some one thing -- but my brother who lives in the citadel has in his gift
that which the Sage desires.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me, is your age great ?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> My mother bore me yet I am older than my mother.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> How in all the world am I to understand you if you
answer my questions in dark parables? Tell me in one word, are you that
fountain concerning which Bernard Count of Trevisan, has written?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I am no fountain but I am water, and the fountain surrounds
me.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Since-you are water, is gold dissolved in you?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Whatever is with me, I love; and to that which is born
with me I impart nourishment. That which is naked I cover with my wings.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I see plainly that it is impossible to talk to you.
Whatever I ask you, your reply is foreign to the point. If you do not answer
my questions better, I will torment you again.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Have pity on me. Master, I will gladly tell you all
I know.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Tell me are you afraid of the fire?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I myself am fire.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Why then do you seek to escape from the fire?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Because my spirit loves the spirit of the fire, and
accompanies it wherever it goes.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Where do you go when you ascend with the fire?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Every pilgrim looks anxiously towards his country and
his home. When he has returned unto these he reposes, and he always comes
back wiser than he left.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Do you return, then?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Yes, but in another form.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I do not understand what you mean, nor yet about
the fire.
<br><b>Mercury:</b> If any one knows the fire of my heart; he has seen
that fire (proper heat) is my food; and the longer the spirit of my heart
feeds on fire, the fatter will it be: its death is afterwards the life
of all things belonging to my kingdom.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Are you great?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> My body, as you must know, can become one drop out
of a thousand drops, and, though I am always one, you can divide my body
as often as you like. But my spirit, or heart, always produces many thousands
of parts out of one part.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> How is this to be brought about? After what manner
should my operation be performed on you?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> I am fire within, fire is my food and my life; but
the life of fire is air, for without air fire is extinguished. Fire is
stronger than air; hence I know not any repose, and crude air can neither
coagulate nor restrain me. Add air to air, so that both become one in even
balance; combine them with fire, and leave the whole to time.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What will happen then?
<br><b>Mercury:</b> Everything superfluous will be removed. The residue
you burn in fire, place in water "cook," and when it is cooked you give
as a medicine, and have no fear.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> You do not answer my questions. Wife, bring the excrements
of swine, and we will see whether we can get the better of his stubbornness.
<p>In his utmost extremity, Mercury called in the help of Nature, amidst
much lamentation and mourning over these threats of our admirable Alchemist.
He impeaches the thankless operator; Nature trusts her son Mercury, whom
she knows to be true and faithful and comes full of wrath to the Alchemist,
calling him imperiously before her.
<p><b>Alchemist:</b> Who calls me?
<br><b>Nature:</b> What are you doing to my son, arch-fool that you are?
Why do you torment him? He is willing to give you every blessing, if you
can understand him.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Who dares to rebuke so great a philosopher, and a
man withal so excellent as I am?
<br><b>Nature:</b> O fool, and of all men most insensate, I know and love
all philosophers, and am loved of them. I take pleasure in aiding their
efforts, and they help me to do that which I am unable to accomplish. But
you so-called Alchemists are constantly offending me, and systematically
doing despite to me; and this is the reason why all your efforts are doomed
to failure.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> It is not true. I, too, am a philosopher, and understand
scientific methods of procedure. I have lived with several princes, and
with more than one philosopher, as my wife can testify. Moreover, I possess
at this very moment a manuscript which has lain hidden for some centuries
in a certain wall. I know very well that I am almost at the end of my labours,
and am on the point of composing the Philosopher's Stone; for it was revealed
to me a few days ago in a dream. I have had a great many dreams, nor do
I ever dream anything untrue; my wife knows it.
<br><b>Nature:</b> It is with you as with a great many of your fellows:
at first they know everything, but in the end their knowledge turns to
ignorance.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> If you are truly Nature, it is you who serve for
the operation of the work.
<br><b>Nature:</b> That is true; but it is performed only by those who
know me, and such do not torment my children, nor do they hinder my working.
Rather they clear away the impediments, that I may the sooner reach the
goal.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> That is exactly what I do.
<br><b>Nature:</b> No; you do nothing but cross me, and deal with my children
against my will. Where you should revive you kill; where you should fix,
you sublime; where you should calcine, you distil; and thus my obedient
son Mercury you torment in the most fearful manner.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Then I will in future deal with him gently, and subject
him only to gradual coction.
<br><b>Nature:</b> That is well, if you possess understanding; otherwise,
you will ruin only yourself and your possessions. If you act in opposition
to my commands, you hurt yourself more than him.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> But how am I to make the Philosopher's Stone?
<br><b>Nature:</b> That question does not justify your ill treatment of
my son. Know that I have many sons and daughters, and that I am swift to
succour those who seek me, provided they are worthy.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> But who is that Mercury?
<br><b>Nature:</b> Know that I have only one such son, he is one of seven,
and the first among them; and though he is now all things, he was at first
only one. In him are the four elements, yet he is not an element. He is
a spirit, yet he has a body; a man, yet he performs a woman's part: a boy,
yet he bears a man's weapons; a beast, and yet he has the wings of a bird.
He is poison, yet he cures leprosy; life, yet he kills all things, a King,
but another occupies his throne; he flees from the fire, yet fire is taken
from him; he is water, but does not wet the hands; he is earth, and yet
he is sown; he is air, and lives by water.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Now I see that I know nothing; only I must not say
so. For I should lose the good opinion of my neighbours, and they would
no longer entrust me with money for my experiments. I must therefore go
on saying that I know everything; for there are many that expect me to
do great things for them.
<br><b>Nature:</b> But if you go on in that way, your neighbours will at
last find you out, and demand their money back.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I must amuse them with promises, as long as I can.
<br><b>Nature:</b> And what then?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I will try different experiments; and if they fail,
I will go to some other country, and live the same life there.
<br><b>Nature:</b> And then?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Ha, ha, ha ! There are many countries, and many greedy
persons who will suffer themselves to be gulled by my promises of mountains
of gold. Thus day will follow day, and in the meantime the King or the
donkey will die, or I myself. Nature: Such philosophers are only fit for
the gallows. Be off, and take with you my most grievous curse. The best
thing that you can do, is to give yourself up to the King's officers, who
will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy!</blockquote>

<center><b><font size=+1>Second Part</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Sulphur</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Preface</font></b></center>

<p>As I am not at liberty to write more plainly than the Ancient Sages,
gentle Reader, you may possibly be dissatisfied with my Book, particularly
as you have so many other philosophical treatises ready to your hand. But
you may be sure that no necessity is laid upon me to write at all, and
that if I have come forward it is only out of love to you, having no expectation
of personal profit, and no desire for empty glory, for which reason I here
refrain, as I have before done, from revealing my identity to the public.
I was under the impression that in the first part of this work I had already
given a lucid account of our whole Art. But my friends tell me that there
is one point with which I have not yet fully dealt, and vehemently urge
me to write this second treatise about Sulphur. The question is, whether
even this Book will convey any information to one before whom the writings
of the Sages and the Open Book of Nature are exhibited in vain. For if
you could incline your ear to the teaching of Nature you would at once
be able to emancipate yourself from the tutelage of printed volumes; in
my opinion it is better to learn from the master himself than from one
of the disciples.
<p>In the preface to my twelve Treatises, and again in the twelfth chapter,
I have already hinted at the reason why there is now so great a multitude
of books on this subject, that they confound and hinder the student instead
of helping him. The confusion is rendered worse confounded by the ill-will
of the Sages, who seem to have set pen to paper for the express purpose
of concealing their meaning; and by the carelessness with which some of
the more important volumes are copied and printed; the sense of a whole
passage is often hopelessly obscured by the addition or omission of one
little word (e.g., the addition of the word "not" in the wrong place).
Yet the student may get information even from these books (as the bee obtains
honey even from poisonous flowers), if he reads them by the light of natural
fact, and with constant reference to the utterances of other Sages. One
writer explains another. Yet some of them are so closely beset with the
difficulties of an obscure phraseology, that it is almost impossible to
understand them, except by reading them side by side with the facts of
Nature; for their interpreters and commentators are more hopelessly unintelligible
even than the writers whom they take upon themselves to explain; the exposition
is more difficult than the text. If you would succeed in this study, keep
your eyes fixed on the possibilities of Nature, and on the properties of
the natural substance. It is universally described as common and easy of
access and apprehension, and it is so, but only to those who know it. He
who knows it can discover it in the dunghill; he who does not will fail
to find it even in gold I have no desire to praise myself, but this one
thing I will say, that the reading of my Books, in combination with a careful
study of Nature, and of the writings of other genuine possessors of this
Stone, must in the end open up to you the understanding of this secret.
If I have planted another tree in the dense forest of Alchemistic literature,
I have done so, not in order to obstruct the path of students, but in order
to aid and refresh them by the way. Let not the diligent and God-fearing
enquirer despair. If he seek the inspiration of God he will most surely
find it. This knowledge is more easily obtained of God than of men. For
His mercy is infinite, and He never forsakes those who put their trust
in Him; with Him there is no respect of persons, nor does He despise the
humble and contrite heart. He has showered the fulness of His mercy even
on me, the unworthiest of all His creatures, in shewing to me His wonderful
power and ineffable goodness, which I am utterly unable to declare. The
only way in which I can, in a small degree, at least prove my gratitude,
is by succouring my struggling brother students with friendly counsel and
assistance. Rest assured, then, gentle Reader, that He will grant this
boon to you, if you wait upon Him day by day with earnest prayer, and in
the power of a holy and loving life. He will throw open to you the portals
of Nature; and you will be amazed at the simplicity of her operations.
Know for certain that Nature is wonderfully simple; and that the characteristic
mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble
in Nature. If you would imitate Nature, you should take her simplicity
for your model in all the operations of Art. If my Book does not please
you, throw it away, and take up some other author; it is short, so that
you need not spend much time in reading it through. Only persevere: to
the importunate knocker the door will at length be opened. The times are
at hand when many secrets of Nature will be revealed to men. The Fourth
or Northern Monarchy is about to be established; the Mother of Knowledge
will soon come; and many things will be brought to light that were hidden
under the three preceding monarchies. This fourth kingdom God will found
by the hand of a prince who will be enriched with all virtues, and endowed
with wisdom greater than that of Solomon. In his time (to adopt the words
of the Psalmist) mercy and truth will meet together; peace and justice
will kiss each other; truth will spring up from the ground, and righteousness
will look down from heaven. There will be one Shepherd and one fold; and
knowledge will be the common property of all. For those days I, too, am
waiting with longing. Pray to God that it may come soon, gentle Reader.
Fear Him, love Him, and- read carefully the books of His chosen Sages-and
you will soon see, and behold with your own eyes, that I have spoken truly.

<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Sulphur</font></b></center>

<p>The Second Principle SULPHUR is by no means the least important of the
great principles, since it is a part of the metals and even a principal
part of the Philosopher's Stone. Many Sages have left us weighty sayings
about this substance: for instance, Geber himself ("Sum of Perfection,"
bk. I, chap. 28), who says: " It illumines all bodies, since it is the
light of the light, and their tincture." But seeing that the ancients regarded
it as the noblest principle, before we proceed to speak about it, we must
first explain the origin of the three principles. The origin of the principles
is a subject which has hitherto been but scantily discussed in the works
of the Sages; and the student who knows nothing about it, is as much in
the dark in regard to this matter, as is a blind man in respect to colour.
I therefore propose to make this point which my predecessors have neglected,
the subject of my treatise.
<p>Now, according to the ancient Sages there are two principles of things,
and more particularly of metals, namely, Sulphur and Mercury; according
to the Moderns there are three: Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, and the source
of these principles are the elements; of which it therefore behoves us
to speak first. Be it known to the students of this art that there are
four elements, and that each has at its centre another element which makes
it what it is. These are the four pillars of the world. They were in the
beginning evolved and moulded out of chaos by the hand of the Creator;
and it is their contrary action which keeps up the harmony and equilibrium
of the mundane machinery; it is they which, through the virtue of celestial
influences, produce all things above and beneath the earth. We will say
a few words about each of them in due order of succession: and first of
all about the nearest element, Earth.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Elementary Earth</font></b></center>

<p>Earth is an element of considerable quality and dignity. In this element
the other three, especially fire, are latent. It is admirably adapted both
to the concealment and to the manifestation of things committed to it.
It is gross and porous. specifically heavy, but naturally light. It is
also the Centre of the World and of the other elements; through its centre
passes the axis of the earth to both poles. It is porous, as we have said,
like a sponge, and produces nothing of itself; but it receives all that
the other three project into it, conscientiously conceals what it should
hide, and brings to light that which it should manifest. Whatsoever is
committed to it putrefies in it through the action of motive heat, and
is multiplied by the separation of the pure from the impure. Heavy substances
are hidden in it. Light substances are driven by heat to its surface. It
is the nurse and womb of all seed and commixtion; and these seeds and compounds
it faithfully preserves and fosters till the season of maturity. It is
cold and dry, but its dryness is tempered with water; outwardly it is visible
and fixed; inwardly it is invisible and volatile. It is a virgin substance,
and dead residue of the creative distillation of the world, which God will
one day calcine, and after extracting the humour, create out of it a new
crystalline earth. In its present state it consists of a pure and an impure
element. The first is used by water for producing natural forms; the latter
remains where it is. It is also the storehouse of all treasures, and in
its centre is the Gehennal fire, conserving the machine of the world, and
this by the expression of water, which it converts into air. This fire
is produced by perpetual motion, and the influences of the Stars; it is
aided by the Solar heat, which is tempered by the atmosphere, and the two
together mature the growth of all things. For this reason the element of
earth has fire intrinsically, and the earth is purified by this inward
fire, as every element is purified by that which is in it. The inmost part,
or centre of the earth, is then the highest purity mixed with fire, in
which there is ceaseless motion, and we have shewn at some length in the
twelve Treatises that it is, as it were, an empty space, into which the
other elements project their products. It is enough for us to remember
that this elementary earth is like a sponge, and the receptacle of all
other elements.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Elementary Water</font></b></center>

<p>Water is an element of great specific gravity, full of unctuous moisture.
Outwardly it is volatile inwardly it is fixed, cold, and humid It is tempered
by air, and is the sperm of the world, in which the seed of all things
is conserved. There is a great difference between sperm and seed. Earth
is the receptacle of sperm, water the receptacle of seed. Whatever the
air, under the influence of fire, distils into the water, is imparted by
the water to the earth. There is always an abundance of sperm awaiting
seed, in order that it may carry it into the matrix, which is performed
by the movement of the air, excited by the imagination of fire. Sometimes
sperm has not a sufficient quantity of seed, for want of heat to digest
it Sometimes, when there is no seed, the sperm enters the womb alone, but
is ejected again without producing any fruit. At other times conception
does not take place, even when there is plenty of seed in the sperm, because
the womb is rendered barren by a superfluity of bad sulphur and malignant
phlegm. Water is capable of commixtion with all things, by means of its
volatile surface; it purifies and dissolves earth; air is congealed in
it, and thus intimately united to it. It is the Solvent of the World, because
by the action of heat, it penetrates the air, and carries with it a warm
vapour which causes the natural generation of those things with which the
earth is like a womb impregnated. When the womb has once received a due
portion of seed, Nature never rests until the natural form (whatever it
may be) has been produced. The humid residue, or sperm, is putrefied in
the earth by means of warmth, and out of it worms and other things are
generated. An intelligent Artist will readily understand how great a variety
of wonders is performed by Nature through this element, as a sperm, but
the said sperm must be operated upon, having already within it an imagined
astral seed of a certain weight. For Nature produces pure things by means
of the first putrefaction, but things far purer by means of the second,
as you see in the case of wood, where vegetable fibre is produced as the
result of the first putrefaction, while the putrefaction of wood engenders
worms and insects-natural forms endowed with sentient life; and it is clear
that animate creatures endowed with sense and motion belong to a higher
creative level, and are moulded of a purer substance than plants.
<p>Water is the menstruum (solvent) of the world, and exists in three degrees
of excellence: the pure, the purer, and the purest. Of its purest substance
the heavens were created; of that which is less pure the atmospheric air
was formed; that which is simply pure remains in its proper sphere, where,
by the Will of God, and the co-operation of Nature, it is guardian of all
subtle substances here below. It has its centre in the heart of the sea;
its polar axis coincides with that of the earth, whence flow forth all
springs and fountains of water, which are presently swollen into great
rivers. This constant movement of water preserves the earth from combustion,
and distributes the seeds of things throughout its length and breadth.
Yet all water courses return to the heart of the sea. As to the ultimate
fate of this water opinions are divided. Some say that all water is generated
in the stars, and the sea does not overflow its shores because the water
is consumed by fire as it reaches the heart of the sea. But this hypothesis
is contrary to Nature's methods of working: Nature produces like out of
like -and how can the stars, which are air and fire, produce water? Moreover,
the safety of this earth depends on the equilibrium of the four elements;
if at any time the total quantity of one element exceeded that of the others,
the universe would relapse into chaos. Hence, if the stars generated water,
they must manifestly produce an equal quantity not only of air and fire,
but also of earth-which is manifestly absurd. It is much more reasonable
to suppose that the waters are chained down, as it were, to the foundation
of the earth by the circumambient air, and that they are constrained by
it to continue in a ceaseless movement towards the Arctic pole-because
no vacuum is possible in Nature; which is also the reason why there is
a Gehennal fire in the centre of the earth, which is presided over by the
Archeus (the first principle) of Nature. For in the creation of the world
God first of all separated the quintessence of the elements from the weltering
mass of chaos; and out of it He evolved fire, the purest of all substances,
giving to it the most exalted place in the universe, and making it, in
a special manner, the dwelling-place of His Sacred Majesty. In the centre
of chaos was kindled that fire which afterwards distilled and carried upward
the purest substance of water But because this most pure fire now occupies
the firmament, and surrounds the throne of God, the waters have been condensed
into a body beneath it; and thus the sky is formed, while the water which
now forms the atmospheric air and the lower firmament is due to the action
of a lower and grosser fire As the water of the firmament cannot pass the
bounds of that highest and celestial fire, so the lower fire cannot pass
through the atmospheric air to the earth; nor can the air pass the bounds
of this lower fire The water and the earth were formed together into one
organic mass Only one part of this water was volatilized into air, in order
to protect the earth from the fierce and consuming heat of the sun If there
had been a vacuum in the air, all the water would have evaporated; but
as the space below the firmament is already filled up with air, the great
bulk of the water is kept below, near the centre of the earth, by the pressure
of the air These natural conditions continue to operate day by day, and
through their normal action the world will be preserved from destruction
during the good pleasure of the Creator The central fire is kindled day
by day by the universal motion and influence of the celestial bodies This
fire heats the water and a certain quantity of the water is dissolved into
air; the air day by day keeps down by its weight the residue of the water,
and causes it to form one mass with the earth And as the equilibrium of
the world is thus naturally preserved by the Creator, so every natural
generative process in the world must repeat the same conditions on a small
scale Thus the elements below act in perfect unison with the elements above,
which God created of a far greater purity and excellence, and the example
of obedience to their influences, which is set by the whole universe, is
imitated on a small scale by the constituent parts of the world below But
let us now proceed to explain the flux and reflux of water There are two
Poles-the Arctic Pole in the north, and the Antarctic Pole, or the southernmost
point of the earth The Arctic Pole possesses the property of magnetic attraction;
the Antarctic Pole that of magnetic repulsion Thus the Arctic Pole attracts
the waters along its axis, and then they are again repelled by the Antarctic
Pole along its axis; and, as the air does not permit inequality, they are
once more forced back to their centre, the Arctic Pole In this their continual
course from the Arctic to the Antarctic Pole, they pass through the middle
(i.e., along the axis) of the earth, are diffused through its pores, and
break out here and there as springs and fountains, which are swollen into
rivers, and return to the Point whence they first flowed forth This universal
motion is incessantly proceeding The waters then, are not generated by
the stars and consumed in the heart of the sea; but they flow forth from
the centre of the sea into the whole earth, and are diffused through all
its pores On this principle the Sages have constructed conduits and aqueducts
since it is well known that water cannot rise higher than the level of
its spring or fount If this were not an actual fact, art would vainly found
its practical conclusions upon it; and the natural principle involved is
illustrated in the process by means of which wine is drawn out of a cask.
<p>It may be objected to our view that if the water of our springs were
derived from the sea, it would be salt, and not sweet, as we actually find
it to be The answer to this objection lies in the fact that the sea water,
in its passage through the pores of the earth, gradually deposits all the
salt which it contains, and thus wells forth from the ground in a sweet
and fresh condition It should, however, be remembered that some of our
springs-called mineral or saline springs-actually do exhibit all the original
saltness of the sea water which has not passed through earth calculated
to retain its mineral element In some places we also meet with hot springs,
which are caused by the passage of the water through certain spots where
large deposits of sulphur have been set afire by the central heat of the
earth; every one who has tasted this water must have observed its sulphureous
flavour Something closely analogous happens when the water passes through
large deposits of iron, or alum! or copper, and acquires their taste Thus
the earth IS a great distilling vessel, formed by the hand of an all wise
Creator, on the model of which all Sages have constructed their small distilling
vessels; and if it pleased God to extinguish the central fire, or to destroy)
the cunning machinery, this universal frame would relapse into chaos. At
the end of time, He will kindle the Central Fire into a brighter flame,
will cause all the water to evaporate, will calcine the earth-and thus
the earth and the water will be rendered more subtle and pure, and will
form a new and more glorious earth The operations of the earth and the
water are always performed in combination, and are mutually dependent,
since they are the two tangible elements, in which the other two work invisibly.
Fire keeps the earth from being submerged, or dissolved; air keeps the
fire from being extinguished; water preserves the earth from combustion.
This is what the Sages call the equilibrium of the elements, and it illustrates
the aid which they render to each other. Fire is closely associated with
earth, and air with water. It will suffice if we remember that elementary
water is the sperm and menstruum of the world, and the receptacle of seed.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Elementary Air</font></b></center>

<p>The most noble element of air is inwardly heavy, visible, and fixed,
outwardly light, volatile, and invisible. It is hot and moist, Is tempered
by fire, and is nobler than earth or water. Air is volatile, but may be
fixed, and when fixed, renders all bodies penetrable. Its purest substance
has been formed into the vital spirits of animals, that which is less pure
into the circumambient atmosphere, and the grosser residue has remained
in the water, and associates with it as fire with its kindred earth. In
the air the seed of all things is formed, as it were, in the body of the
male, and is projected by its circulative motion into its sperm, which
is water. It contains the vital spirit of all creatures, is the life of
all, and penetrates and forces its seed upon all, as the man does upon
the woman. It nourishes, impregnates, conserves the other elements; and
we are taught by daily experience that it is the life not only of minerals,
animals, and vegetables, but also of the other elements. We see that water
becomes foul and unwholesome without a supply of fresh air; without it
fire is extinguished-as is well known to Alchemists who regulate the temperature
of their fire by the supply of air. Air is also that which conserves the
pores of the earth. In short, the whole universe is kept fresh and sweet
by air, and it is the vital element of man, beast, plant, and stone. It
contains the seed of all things which is forced up, into vegetables for
instance, through the pores of the earth by the action of fire, and thus
the tree is built up atom by atom out of the vital element of congealed
air. This vital force has remained in it ever since the time when the Spirit
of Life brooded over the waters in the air. The magnetic power of life
which air undoubtedly possesses, was put into it by God at the Creation.
As the magnet attracts to itself hard steel, and as the Arctic Pole attracts
to itself the water, so the air, by means of the vegetable magnet which
is in the seed, draws to itself the nutriment of the menstruum of the world
(which is water). This power of attracting water is in a certain part (viz.,
the 280th part) of all seed. If, then, any one would be a cunning planter
of trees, he should take care to turn the point of attraction towards the
North; for as the Arctic Pole attracts water, so the vertical point draws
to itself the seminal substance. If you would know what the point of attraction
in a tree is, submerge it entirely in water; that point which always appears
first, will be the point of attraction. In the air, then, is the seed and
the vital spirit, or abode of the soul of every creature.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Elementary Fire</font></b></center>

<p>Fire is the purest and noblest of all elements, full of adhesive unctuous
corrosiveness, penetrant, digestive, inwardly invisible, fixed, hot and
dry, outwardly visible, and tempered by the earth. Of its purest substance
was created the Throne of the Almighty; of that which is less pure, the
Angels; out of fire of an inferior purity were created the stars and the
heavenly luminaries; that which was less pure still was used to bear up
the heavens; that which is impure and unctuous -- that, namely, which we
have termed the fire of Gehenna -- is in the centre of the earth, and was
there inclosed and shut up to set this lower world in motion. Though these
different fires are separate, yet they are also joined together by natural
sympathy.
<p>This element is the most passive of all, and resembles a chariot when
it is drawn it moves; when it is not drawn, it stands still. It exists
imperceptibly in all things; and of it is fashioned the vital rational
soul, which distinguishes man from all other animals, and makes him like
God. This rational soul was divinely infused into his vital spirit by God,
and entitles him to be regarded as a microcosm, or small world by himself.
But the fire which surrounds the Throne of God is of an infinitely pure
and simple essence, and this is the reason that no impure soul can know
God, and that no human eye can penetrate this essential fire, for fire
is the death and destruction of everything composite-and all material substances
are of this nature What I said about the restful passivity of fire, applies
in a certain sense to the eternal calm and unchangeableness of the Divine
Nature. For as the fire sleeps in the flint, until it is roused and stirred
up from without, so the power of God, which is a consuming fire, is only
roused to action by the kindling breath of His Almighty Will. How calmly
and solemnly does not even an earthly monarch sit enthroned in the pomp
and state of his royalty! His courtiers hardly venture to move, and all
around is calm and still. But when he rises what a stir of motion and activity
does he not cause! All that are about him arise with him, and presently
you see him sweeping along in grand and stately majesty. Yet the pomp of
an earthly prince is but a faint reflex of the glory of the King of Kings.
When He utters the voice of His Will, all heaven is roused, the world trembles,
and thousands of angels speed forth on His errand. But it may be asked
how I come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are removed
far beyond human ken. My answer is that the Sages have been taught of God
that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly
and spiritual pattern: that the very existence of this world is based upon
the reality of its celestial archetype; and that God has created it in
imitation of the spiritual and invisible universe, in order that men might
be the better enabled to comprehend His heavenly teaching, and the wonders
of His absolute and ineffable power and wisdom. Thus the Sage sees heaven
reflected in Nature as in a mirror . and he pursues this Art, not for the
sake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals;
he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful, lest the mysteries
of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze. If you will but rightly
consider it, you yourself are an image of God, and a little picture of
the great world. For a firmament you have the quintessence of the four
elements attracted to the formative womb out of the chaos of seed, and
bounded by your skin; your blood is fire in which lives your soul, the
king of your little universe) acting through the medium of the vital spirit;
your heart is the earth, where the Central Fire is always at work; our
mouth is your Arctic, and your stomach your Antarctic Pole, and all your
members correspond to some part of the greater world as I have set forth
at some length in my work on the Harmony of the Universe and in the Chapter
on Astronomy. In the microcosm of man's nature the soul is the deputy or
Viceroy of the Creator. It governs the mind, and the mind governs the body:
the mind is conscious of all that is conceived in the soul, and all the
members understand the mind, obey it, and wait eagerly to carry out its
behests. The body knows nothing of itself; all its motions and desires
are caused by the mind; it is to the mind what the tool is to the craftsman.
But though the rational soul operates in the body, a more important part
of its activity is exerted on things outside the body: it rules absolutely
outside the body, and therein differs from the vital spirits of brute beasts.
In the same way, the Creator of the world partly acts in and through things
belonging to this world, and is thereby, in a sense, included in this world.
But He absolutely transcends this world by that infinite part of His activity
which lies beyond the bounds of the universe, and which is too high and
glorious for the body of the world. The great difference between the soul's
extracorporal, and God's extramundane, activity, is that man's rational
activity is purely imaginative and mental, whereas God's thoughts are immediately
translated into real existences. I might be mentally in the streets of
Rome, but my journey would be purely imaginative; God's conceptions are
at once objective essences. God, then, is included in the world, only as
the soul is enclosed in the body, while it has power to do things which
far transcend the capacity of the body. By material relations such as these
you may know God, and learn to distinguish Him from the material manifestations
of His power. When once the gates of knowledge have been flung wide for
you, your understanding will be enlarged.
<p>We said that fire was the quietest of all elements, and that it is stirred
by a kind of motion well known to the Sages. The Sage should be perfectly
acquainted with the generation and destruction of all things; he is familiar
with the creation of the heavens, and the composition and commixtion of
things terrestrial; yet, though he knows everything, he cannot make everything.
He knows the anatomy and composition of the human body-yet he cannot make
a man. This is a mystery which the Creator has kept in His own hand. Nature
cannot work till it has been supplied with a material: the first matter
is furnished by God, the second matter by the Sage. But in the philosophical
work Nature must excite the fire which God has enclosed in the centre of
each thing. The excitation of this fire is performed by the will of Nature,
and sometimes also by the will of a skillful Artist who can dispose Nature,
for fire naturally purifies every species of impurity.
<p>All composite substances are purified by fire, as all substances that
are not fixed owe their purification to water It is the property of fire
to separate and divide composite substances; and this separation means
a purging away of the impure from the pure. This element also acts secretly,
by marvellous means, not only in opposition to the rest of the elements,
but also to all other things For as the reasonable soul was made of this
most pure fire, so the vegetable soul was made of the elementary fire which
Nature governs The fire which is contained in the centre of any given thing
acts in the following way Nature provides the motive power, which stirs
up the air; the air stirs up and rouses the fire, which separates, purges,
digests, colours, and brings every seed to maturity, and expels the matured
seed through the sperm into places or wombs, either pure or impure, more
or less hot, dry, or humid; and according to the nature of the place or
womb, different things are produced (cp. the Twelve Treatises). So the
Most High God has ordained that, in the economy of the universe, one thing
should be at enmity with another, and that the death of one thing should
be the life of the other; that one thing should consume what another produces,
and evolve out of it some higher and nobler form of life. The elementary
separation of all living things is death; and hence it is necessary for
man to die, as his body is compounded of the four elements, which cannot
hold together for ever. In spite of this fact, our science furnishes an
incontestible proof of man's original immortality. It is certainly true
that all composite substances are liable to decomposition; that this decomposition,
when it takes place in the animal world, is called death; and that the
human body is a substance compounded of the four elements. But it is also
true that the elements of Paradise, where man was created, are not subject
to this law, seeing that they arc most sure and incorruptible heavenly
essences, and if man had remained in this pure and celestial region, his
body would have been incapable of natural decay. Adam, however, in an evil
day for our race, disobeyed his Creator, and straightway was driven forth
to the beasts, into the world of corruptible elements which God had created
for the beasts only. From that day forward his food was derived from perishable
substances, and death began to work in his members. The pure elements of
his creation were gradually mingled and infected with the corruptible elements
of the outer world, and thus his body became more and more gross, and liable,
through its grossness, to natural decay and death. The process of degeneration
was, of course, slow in the case of Adam and his first descendants; but,
as time went on, the seed out of which men were generated became more and
more infected with perishable elements. The continued use of corruptible
food rendered their bodies more and more gross-and human life was soon
shortened to a very brief span indeed. In some favoured climes, where men
eat and drink moderately, they still sometimes live to a green old age;
but in our latitudes men abridge the term of their natural existence by
grossly filling themselves with an excess of elementary corruptible food,
and thus, before their time, become like "the beasts that perish." When
the pure and essential elements are joined together in loving equilibrium,
as they are in our Stone, they are inseparable and immortal, like the human
body in Paradise; whence also our philosophical treasure has been compared
to the creation of man, an analogy which modern wise men, who take ail
things literally, have understood as referring to the corrupted generation
of this present order, which is produced from corruptible elements.
<p>It was the recollection of man's immortality in Paradise that first
set Sages a-thinking whether those pure and essential elements might not
be obtained in this world, and united in one body. At length a merciful
Creator made known to them that the desired conjunction of such elements
existed in gold. It could not be found among the animals who are sustained
by corruptible food, nor in vegetables, because they exhibit the elements
in a state of inequality and contention. When corruptible elements are
united in a certain subject, their strife must sooner or later bring about
its decomposition, which is, of course, followed by putrefaction; in putrefaction,
the impure is separated from the pure: and if the pure elements are then
once more joined together by the action of natural heat, a much nobler
and higher form of life is produced. In the strife of the elements, which
follows when a body has been broken up by the victory of water, earth and
air unite with fire, and together they overcome the water, digest, cook,
and ultimately congeal it-which is the beginning of a new life. For if
the hidden central fire, which during life was in a state of passivity,
obtain the mastery, it attracts to itself all the pure elements, which
are thus separated from the impure, and form the nucleus of a far purer
form of life. It is thus that our Sages are able to produce immortal things,
particularly by decomposition of minerals; and you see that the whole process,
from beginning to end, is the work of fire.
<p>Thus, then, we have briefly set forth as much as will serve our purpose
concerning the four elements. Truly the description of each might be extended
into a large volume, but we postpone all amplification for our Treatise
on Harmony, which, God helping, if our life be spared, will be opportune
to a more large discourse upon natural things.

<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning the Three Principles of All Things</font></b></center>

<p>The three Principles of things are produced out of the four elements
in the following manner: Nature, whose power is in her obedience to the
Will of God, ordained from the very beginning, that the four elements should
incessantly act on one another, so, in obedience to her behest, fire began
to act on air, and produced Sulphur; air acted on water and produced Mercury;
water, by its action on earth, produced Salt. Earth, alone, having nothing
to act upon, did not produce anything, but became the nurse, or womb, of
these three Principles. We designedly speak of three Principles; for though
the Ancients mention only two, it is clear that they omitted the third
(Salt), not from ignorance, but from a desire to lead the uninitiated astray.
Whoever would be a student of this sacred science must know the marks whereby
these three Principles are to be recognised, and also the process by which
they are developed. For as the three Principles are produced out of four,
so they, in their turn, must produce two, a male and a female; and these
two must produce an incorruptible one, in which are exhibited the four
(elements) in a highly purified and digested condition, and with their
mutual strife hushed in unending peace and goodwill. In every natural composition
these three represent the body, the spirit, and the hidden soul; and if,
after purging them well, you join them together they must, by a natural
process, result in a most pure substance. For though the soul is most noble,
yet it cannot reach the goal without the spirit which is its place and
abode; and if it is your desire to bring it back to a given place. both
the soul and the place must be purged and washed from all impurity, so
that the soul may dwell in glory, and nevermore depart. Without these three
Principles, the Artist can do nothing, since even Nature is powerless without
them. They are in all things, and without them there is nothing in the
world, neither, indeed, can be. Their origin being such as we have described,
it is from these, by an imitation of Nature, that you must produce the
Mercury of the Philosophers, and their first matter, bearing in mind the
laws which govern natural things, and especially metals. Do not think that
Salt is unimportant because it is omitted by the Ancients; they could not
do without it, even if they did not name it, seeing that it is the Key
which opens the infernal prison house, where sulphur lies in bonds. The
three Principles are necessary because they are the immediate substance
of metals. The remoter substance of metals is the four elements, but no
one can produce anything out of them but God; and even God makes nothing
of them but these three Principles Why, then, should the Sage lose time
and labour over the four cements, when he has the substance made ready
to his hand by Nature ? It is surely less troublesome to go three miles
than four, and as these three Principles exist in all things. and, according
to their proportions, etc., produce either metals, or plants or animals,
it is best to use them as our first substance. The body is earth, the spirit
water, the soul fire or sulphur of gold. The Spirit augments the quantity
of the body, the soul the virtue. But because in the matter of weight there
is more of spirit than of fire, the spirit is uplifted, oppresses the fire,
and attracts it to itself in such a way that both augment in virtue, and
the earth, which is mediate between them, augments in weight. The Artist
should determine which of the three Principles he is seeking and should
assist it so that it may overcome its contrary. Afterwards he must seek
by his skill to supplement what has been wanting in Nature and thus his
chosen Principle will obtain the necessary victory. The element of earth
is nothing but a receptacle, in which fire and air carry on their strife
through the mediation of air. If water predominate, temporal and corruptible
things are produced; if fire obtains the victory, it produces lasting and
incorruptible things. So you know which of the elements ought to receive
your aid. Moreover, though fire and water are in all things, they can produce
nothing without air and earth. Their activity is aroused by external heat
(in Nature, the Central Fire of the earth), and in their struggle they
are assisted each by that which is like to it. By this strife they are
subtilized in the pores of the earth, and when they ascend to the surface
they produce flowers and fruit, in which they closely associate together
as friends; and the more they are subtilized and purified in their ascent,
the more excellent are the fruits which they produce.
<p>When the purification has thus been performed, let water and fire become
friends, which they will readily do in their earth which ascends with them;
and the process will be the more speedily and perfectly accomplished, if
you combine the two in their proper proportions-thus improving upon Nature
In all natural compounds fire is always the smallest part; but it is aided
and stirred up by the action of outward fire; and according as fire is
overcome or obtains the mastery. imperfect or perfect things are the result.
The outward fire does not enter into the composition as an essential part
of it, but only by the effect which it helps to produce. The inward fire
is sufficient, if it only receive nutriment from the outward fire, which
feeds it as wood feeds elemental fire; in proportion to the quantity of
nutriment the inward fire grows and multiplies. Care should be taken, therefore)
that the outward fire is not so fierce as to devour instead of feeding,
the inward fire. Gentle coction will be the best means of attaining perfection,
and of adding excellence to weight But as it is difficult to add to a compound
substance, I would advise rather to produce the same effect by removing
that which is present in an excessive quantity. Remove that which is too
much, and let the compound develop itself naturally. But many artists sow
straw instead of grain; others sow both; many throw away that which the
Sages love; others begin and do not persevere to the end; they look for
short and easy labour in a difficult Art. But we say that this Art consists
in an even mingling of the virtues of the elements-in the natural equilibrium
of the hot, the dry, the cold, and the moist-in the conjunction of the
male and female, the female having engendered the male, i.e., of fire and
the radical humour of the metals. If you understand that the Mercury of
the Sages contains within itself its own good Sulphur, digested and matured
by Nature, you can accomplish the whole process by means of Mercury alone;
but if you know how to add the supplement which our Art requires to the
natural proportions of substances, to double the Mercury, and to triple
the Sulphur, you will all the more quickly produce, first the good, then
the better, and finally the best-though only one sulphur appears, and two
mercuries (which, are, however, of the same stock); they should not be
crude nor too much digested, yet well purged and dissolved (if you understand
me).
<p>It is really unnecessary to describe the matter of the Mercury and the
Sulphur of the Sages, as it has already been as plainly delineated by the
Ancients as is consistent with our vow. We do not altogether say that the
Mercury of the Philosophers is a common thing, or that they have openly
called it by its name, and that the matter from which Mercury and Sulphur
are philosophically extracted has been plainly pointed out. For the Mercury
itself is not found above ground, but is extracted by an artifice from
Sulphur and Mercury conjoined, in short, Sulphur and Mercury are the ore
of our quicksilver, and this quicksilver has power to dissolve, mortify,
and revive metals, which power it has received from the sulphur (which
has Some of the properties of an acid). In order to put you on the right
track, I will also tell you the difference between our quicksilver and
common mercury. Common mercury does not dissolve gold and silver so as
to amalgamate with them; but when our quicksilver dissolves gold and silver,
it almagamates with them in inseparable union, as water is mixed with water.
Common mercury has bad combustible sulphur, which turns it black; our quicksilver
contains incombustible, fixed, good, snow-white and red sulphur. Common
mercury is cold and humid; our quicksilver is hot and humid. Common mercury
blackens other bodies; our quicksilver renders them white and pure as crystal.
Common mercury is changed by precipitation into a yellow powder and bad
sulphur; our quicksilver is converted by heat into snow-white, good, fixed,
and fusible sulphur. Common mercury becomes more fusible, our quicksilver
more fixed, the more it is subjected to coction. Our quicksilver possesses
such marvellous virtue that it would by itself be sufficient for our purpose,
if subjected to gentle coction; but in order to accelerate its congelation,
the Sages add to it its well digested and matured sulphur.
<p>We might well have cited philosophers in confirmation of the points
of our discourse, but as our writings are more clear than are theirs, we
have no need of their support. Whosoever understands them will understand
us better. If you would practise our Art, learn first to hold your tongue,
and study the nature of minerals, metals, and vegetables. Our Mercury may
be obtained from all things, as everything has it; only from some substances
it is more easily procured than from others. Our Art is not a matter of
luck or accident, but is founded on a real knowledge, and there is only
one matter in the world by which, and of which, the Stone of the Philosophers
is prepared. The substance is indeed to be found everywhere, but the method
of its extraction out of some matters would take a lifetime, and if you
begin your search without a due knowledge of natural things, more especially
in minerals, you will be working in the dark and in blindness. It is, indeed,
possible to set about our Art in a casual manner; and some who actually
operate on our quicksilver, begin at the wrong end, and thus fail in bringing
it to perfection, because they are quite in the dark about its real nature.
Yet after all, we must confess that a right knowledge of our Art is the
gift of God alone, and is granted to diligent students in answer to earnest
and importunate prayer. To the Master it may appear easy enough; but to
the beginner it must seem at first very hard and uphill work. He should
not, however, despair, for in due time he will receive the reward of his
diligence and aspiration; even in the dangers which the knowledge may bring
upon him, he will be kept from harm by the loving hand of Providence, as
I can testify from personal experience. We have with us God's Ark of the
Covenant, which contains the most precious of earthly things, and is guarded
by the holy Angel of the Lord. We heard that our enemies had fallen into
the snare which they had laid for us; that those who sought our lives had
been enclosed in the meshes of death; that those w ho attempted to rob
us of our goods had lost all that they possessed; and that those who strove
to blacken our reputation, died in shame and dishonour. Such is the care
which God has of us, Who, from our childhood, has kept us safe under the
shadow of His wings. And the feeling uppermost in our minds is the humbling
consciousness of our utter unworthiness: we do not deserve the very least
of His great mercies. But one thing we do and will] do: our hope and trust
always have been, are, and will be, in Him alone. We will not put our confidence
in men or in princes: we will place ourselves in the hands of One who remains
unchanged when all earthly power and greatness have passed away. The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: never did Sage utter truer word
than this; and if we would attain to the knowledge of this glorious science,
if we would be able to use it well when we possess it, we must wait on
God continually. and importune Him with earnest prayer. But to proceed
with our description of the Matter. We said that it was quicksilver, and
quicksilver only: whatever is added, is gained from this same substance.
We have repeatedly affirmed that all things earthly are evolved out of
three principles. But for our purpose they must be purged of their impurities,
and then recombined; that which is wanting is added-and thus imitating
and assisting Nature we arrive at a degree of perfection such as Nature
is unable to attain, on account of the impurities with which her operations
are clogged. Do not suffer yourself to be confounded by the apparent contradictions
which the Sages have introduced into their writings for the purpose of
keeping their secret. Select only those sayings which are agreeable to
Nature; take the roses, leave the thorns. If you wish to produce a metal,
your fundamental substance should be metallic; only a dog can beget a dog;
without wheat you will vainly plough your field; and all your endeavours
in this Art will be in vain, unless you take your radical humour from a
metal. There is one substance, one Art, one operation It is as erroneous
to suppose that any of the particular benefits of our Stone can be enjoyed
before the Stone itself has been prepared, as it would be absurd to imagine
that you can have a branch without a root or tree. If you have water you
can cook in it various kinds of meat, and thus obtain broth of different
flavours; but there will be no broth unless you have both the water and
the meat In metals, then, as in all other things, there is only one first
substance, but the universal substance is modified in a vast variety of
ways, according to the course of its subsequent development. Thus one thing
is the mother of all things. This great fact ought always to be borne in
mind in studying the works of the Sages; for nothing but mistakes and disappointment
can result from a slavishly literal interpretation of their books. It is
a pity that, instead of humbly studying and following Nature our Alchemists
are so ready to adopt any fancy or notion that happens to pass through
their minds. They seek to attain the end not only without a middle part,
but without so much as a beginning. But how can anyone who sets about our
Art in so casual and haphazard a manner expect anything but disappointments?
Let our Alchemists have done, then, once for all, with their sophistical
methods, to which they ascribe so great an importance-with their dealbations,
rubrefactions, fixations of the Moon, extractions of the soul of gold,-and
let them place themselves under the unerring guidance of Nature For though
the soul of the metal has to be extracted, it must not be killed in the
operation; and the extraction of the living soul, which has to be reunited
to the glorified body, must be carried on in a way very different from
the violent method commonly prevailing among Alchemists. Wed not propose
to multiply wheat without seed corn. But let us, in concluding this part
of the subject, earnestly inculcate on the student's mind the necessity
of having seed that will germinate and grow, and to avoid the use of seed
which has been killed by an excess of fiery heat.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Sulphur</font></b></center>

<p>Among the three principles the Sages have justly assigned the first
place to Sulphur, as the whole Art is concerned with the manner of its
preparation. Sulphur is of three chief kinds: that which tinges or colours;
that which congeals mercury and essential sulphur, which matures it. The
properties and preparation of this Sulphur we propose to describe, not
in a set treatise, but in a dialogue like that which brought out the essential
properties of Mercury. We will only say, by way of preface, that Sulphur
is more mature than the other principles, and that Mercury cannot be coagulated
without it. The aim and object of our Art is to elicit from metals that
Sulphur by means of which the Mercury of the Sages is, in the veins of
the earth, congealed into silver and gold; in this operation the Sulphur
acts the part of the male, and our Mercury that of the female. Of the composition
and action of these two are engendered the Mercuries of the Philosophers.
<p>In our former dialogue we gave an account of the meeting of Alchemists,
which a sudden tempest brought to so abrupt a close Among those who took
a prominent part in the proceedings, was a good friend of the first Alchemist;
he was not a bad man, or an impostor, but, as they say, nobody's enemy
except his own; yet he was foolish withal, and though really very ignorant,
had no small opinion of his own wisdom and learning. He had at the meeting
been the foremost champion of the claims of Sulphur to be-regarded as the
first substance of the Stone, and was satisfied that he would have been
able to make good that claim, if the meeting had not been prematurely broken
up. So when he got home he resumed his operations on Sulphur in a very
confident spirit. He subjected it to distillation, sublimation, calcination,
fixation, and to countless other chemical processes, in which he spent
much time and money. without arriving at any result whatsoever. His failures
at length began to prey on his health and spirits, and in order to recruit
the former, and raise the latter, he fell into the habit of taking long
walks in the neighbourhood of the town where he lived. But wherever he
went he could think of nothing but Sulphur. One day, with his mind full
of this besetting idea, and being wrought almost to an ecstacy he entered
a certain verdant grove, in which there was abundance not only of trees,
herbs, and fruits, but also of animals, birds, minerals, and metals. Of
water there was indeed a great scarcity; it was carried to the place by
means of aqueducts, and among these was a conduit flowing with water extracted
from the rays of the moon ; -- but this water was reserved for the use
of the Nymph of the grove. In the grove there were two young men tending
oxen and rams, and from them he learned that the grove belonged to the
Nymph Venus. The Alchemist was gratified enough, but all his thoughts were
absorbed by the subject of Sulphur, and when he remembered the words of
the Sages, who say that the substance is vile and common, and its treatment
easy, when he recollected the vast amount of time, labour, and money which
he had vainly spent upon it, he lifted up his voice and in the bitterness
of his heart, cursed Sulphur. Now Sulphur was in that grove, though the
Alchemist did not know it. But suddenly he heard a voice which said: "my
friend why do you curse Sulphur? "
<p>He looked up in bewilderment nobody was to be seen. "My friend, why
are you so sad?" continued the voice.
<p><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, I seek the Philosopher's Stone as one that
hungers after bread.
<br><b>Voice</b>: And why thus do you curse Sulphur?
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> My Lord, the Sages call it the substance of the Stone;
yet I have spent all my time and labour in vain upon it, and am well nigh
reduced to despair.
<br><b>Voice</b>: It is true that Sulphur is the true and chief substance
of the Stone. Yet you curse it unjustly. For it lies heavily chained in
a dark prison and cannot do as it would. Its hands and feet have been bound,
and the doors of the dungeon closed upon it, at the bidding of its mother,
Nature, who was angry with it for too readily obeying the summons of every
Alchemist. It is now confined in such a perfect labyrinth of a prison,
that it can be set free only by those Sages to whom Nature herself has
entrusted the secret.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Ah! miserable that I am, this is why he was unable
to come to me! How very hard and unkind of the mother! When is he to be
set at large again?
<br><b>Voice</b>: That can only be by means of hard and persevering labour.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Who are his gaolers?
<br><b>Voice</b>: They are of his own kindred, but grievous tyrants.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> And who are you?
<br><b>Voice</b>: I am the judge and the chief gaoler, and my name is Saturn.
Alchemist: Then Sulphur is detained in your prison?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Yes; but I am not his keeper.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What does he do in prison?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Whatever his gaolers command.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> And what can he do?
<br><b>Voice</b>: He can perform a thousand things, and is the heart of
all. He can perfect metals and minerals, impart understanding to animals,
produce flowers in herbs and trees, corrupt and perfect air; in short,
he produces all the odours and paints all the colours in the world.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Of what substance does he make the flowers?
<br><b>Voice</b>: His guards furnish him with vessels and matter; Sulphur
digests it; and according to the diversity of the digestion, and the weight
of the matter, he produces choice flowers, having their special odours.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, is he old?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Know, friend, that Sulphur is the virtue of the world,
and though Nature's second-born-yet the oldest of all things. To those
who know him, however, he is as obedient as a little child. He is most
easily recognised by the vital spirit in animals, the colour in metals,
the odour in plants. Without his help his mother can do nothing.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Is he the sole heir, or has he any brothers?
<br><b>Voice</b>: He has some brothers who are quite unworthy of him; and
a sister that he loves, and who is to him as a mother.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Is he always the same?
<br><b>Voice</b>: As to his nature, it is always the same. But in person
his heart only is pure: his garments are spotted.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, was he ever quite free?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Yes; in the days of the great Masters and Sages whom
Nature loved, and to whom she gave the keys of the prison.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Who were these wise adepts?
<br><b>Voice</b>: There have been very many, and among them Hermes, who
was one and the same with the mother of Sulphur. After him there were kings,
princes, a long line of Sages, including Aristotle and Avicenna. All these
delivered Sulphur from his bonds.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What does he give to them for delivering him?
<br><b>Voice</b>: When he is set free, he binds his gaolers, and gives
their three kingdoms to his deliverer. He also gives to him a magic mirror,
in which the three parts of the wisdom of the whole world may be seen and
known at a glance: and this mirror clearly exhibits the creation of the
world, the influences of the celestial virtues on earthly things, and the
way in which Nature composes substances by the regulation of heat. With
its aid, men may at once understand the motion of the Sun and Moon, and
that universal movement by which Nature herself is governed-also the various
degrees of heat, cold, moisture, and dryness, and the virtues of herbs
and of all other things. By its means the physician may at once, without
consulting an herbarium, tell the exact composition of any given plant
or medicinal herb. But now-a-days men are content to trust to the authority
of great writers, and no longer attempt to use their own eyes. They quote
Aristotle and Galen, as if there was not much more to be learned from the
great Book of Nature which is spread open before them. Know that all things
on the earth and under the earth are engendered and produced by the three
principles, but sometimes by two, unto which the third, nevertheless, adheres.
He who knows these three principles, and their proportions as conjoined
by Nature, can tell easily by their greater or less coction, the degrees
of heat in each subject, and whether they have been well, badly, or passably
cooked. For those who know the three principles know also all vegetables
by sight, taste, and odour, for these senses determine the three principles,
and the degree of their decoction.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, they say that Sulphur is a Medicine.
<br><b>Voice</b>: Nay, you might rather call him a physician, and to him
who delivers him out of prison, he gives his blood as a Medicine.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> How long can a man ward off death by means of this
universal Medicine?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Until the time originally appointed. But many Sages who
did not take it with proper caution, have died before that time.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Do you call it a poison then?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Have you not observed that a great flame swallows up
a small one? Men who had received the Art by the teachings of others, thought
that the more powerful the dose they took of our Medicine the more beneficial
would be the effect. They did not consider that one grain of it has strength
to penetrate many thousand pounds of metals.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> How then should they have used it?
<br><b>Voice</b>: They ought to have taken only so much as would have strengthened
and nourished, without overwhelming, their natural heat.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, I know how to make that Medicine.
<br><b>Voice</b>: Blessed are you if you do! For the blood of Sulphur is
that inward virtue and dryness which congeals quicksilver into gold and
imparts health and perfection to all bodies. But the blood of Sulphur is
obtained only by those who can deliver him from prison; and therefore he
is so closely imprisoned that he can hardly breathe, lest he should come
to the Palace of the King.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Is he so closely imprisoned in all metals?
<br><b>Voice</b>: In some his imprisonment is less strict than in others.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Why, Lord, is he imprisoned in the metals so tyrannously?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Because if he once came unto his royal palace, he would
no longer fear his guards. He could look from the windows with freedom,
and appear before the whole world, for he would be in his own kingdom,
though not in that state of highest power whereto he desires to arrive.
Alchemist: What is his food?
<br><b>Voice</b>: His food is air, in a digested state, when he is free;
but in prison he is compelled to consume it in a crude state.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Master, cannot those quarrels between him and his
gaolers be composed?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Yes, by a wise and cunning craftsman.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Why does he not offer them terms of peace?
<br><b>Voice</b>: He cannot do so by himself: his indignation gets the
better of his discretion.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Why does he not do so through some commissary?
<br><b>Voice</b>: He who could put an end to their strife would be a wise
man, and worthy of undying honour. For if they were friends, they would
help, instead of hindering each other, and bring forth immortal things.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> I will gladly undertake the duty of reconciling them.
For I am a very learned man, and they could not resist my practical skill.
I am a great Sage, and my Alchemistic treatment would quickly bring about
the desired end. But tell me, is this the true Sulphur of the Sages ?
<br><b>Voice</b>: He is Sulphur; you ought to know whether he is the Sulphur
of the Sages.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> If I find his prison, shall I be able to deliver
him?
<br><b>Voice</b>: Yes, if you are wise enough to do so. It is easier to
deliver him than to find his prison.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> When I do find him, shall I be able to make him into
the Philosopher's Stone ?
<br><b>Voice</b>: I am no prophet. But if you follow his mother's advice,
and dissolve the Sulphur you will have the Stone.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> In what substance is this Sulphur to be found ?
<br><b>Voice</b>: In all substances. All things in the world -- metals,
herbs, trees, animals, stones, are its ore.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> But out of what sub stances do the Sages procure
it?
<br><b>Voice</b>: My friend, you press me somewhat too closely. But I may
say that though it is every where, yet it has certain palaces where the
Sages can most conveniently find it; and they worship it when it swims
in its sea and sports with Vulcan (god of fire), though there it is disguised
in a most poor garb. Now is it in a dark prison, hidden from sight. But
it is one only subject, and if you cannot find it at home you will scarcely
do so in the forest. Yet, to give you some heart in your research, I will
solemnly assure you that it is most perfect in gold and silver-most easily
obtained in quicksilver.
<p>With these words Saturn departed, and the Alchemist, being weary with
walking, fell into a deep sleep, in which he saw the following vision:
He beheld in that grove a spring of water, near which Salt and Sulphur
were walking and quarreling, until at last they began to fight. Salt dealt
Sulphur a grevious wound, out of which there flowed, instead of blood,
pure, milk-white water, that swelled into a great river. In this river
the virgin goddess, Diana, came to bathe; and a certain bold prince, who
was passing by, was inflamed with great love towards her; which she, perceiving
and returning, pretended to be sinking under water. The prince bade his
attendants assist her; but they excused themselves, saying that the river,
though it looked small and all but dried up, was most dangerous. " And,"
said they, ' many of those who have passed here before have perished in
it." Then that prince threw off his thick cloak, plunged into the river,
and stretched out his arm to save the beautiful Diana; but she grasped
it so convulsively that they both sank under water together. Soon afterwards
their souls were seen rising upward above the water, and they said, " We
have done well, for in no other way could we be delivered from our stained
and spotted bodies."
<p><b>Alchemist:</b> (speaking): Will you ever return into those bodies?
<br><b>Souls</b>: Not while they are so polluted-but when they are cleansed,
and the river is dried up by the heat of the sun.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> What do you do in the meantime?
<br><b>Souls</b>: We soar above the water till the storm and the mists
cease....
<br>Then the Alchemist thought that he saw a great number of his fellows
come to the spot where the body of the Sulphur lay slain by the Salt; and
they divided it among themselves, and gave a piece to him also. Then they
went home, and began to operate on their (dead) Sulphur, and are at it
to this day. Presently Saturn returned, and the Alchemist said: Master,
come quickly, I have found Sulphur -- help me to make the Stone.
<br><b>Saturn</b>: Gladly, my friend. Prepare the quicksilver, and the
sulphur, and give me the vessel.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oh, I do not want Mercury. It is a delusion and a
snare, as my friend the other Alchemist discovered to his smart.
<br><b>Saturn</b>: I can do nothing without quicksilver.
<br><b>Alchemist:</b> Oh no, we will make it of Sulphur only.
<p>So they set to work on that piece of dead Sulphur, and sublimed, calcined,
and subjected it to all manner of chemical operations. But they produced
nothing save little bits of sulphurous tow, such as they use for lighting
fires. Then the Alchemist confessed the fruitlessness of his endeavours,
and bade Saturn set about the work in his own way. Then Saturn took two
kinds of quicksilver, of different substance but one root, washed them
with his urine, and called them the sulphurs of sulphurs; then he mixed
the fixed with the volatile, after which he placed them in a proper vessel,
and set a watch to prevent the sulphur from escaping; afterwards he placed
them in a bath of very gentle heat -- and thus they made the Philosopher's
Stone, which must always follow as the outcome of the right substance.
Then the Alchemist took it in his hand, admired its beautiful purple colour,
and danced about with it, shouting aloud with joy and delight. Suddenly
the glass slipped out of his hand and broke into a thousand pieces; the
stone vanished; and the Alchemist awoke with nothing in his hand but some
pieces of sulphurous tow. There are a good many Alchemists who, having
an extremely favourable opinion of themselves, and fancying that they can
hear the grass grow, rail against this Art, because they think that if
the Stone were not a mere delusion, they could not have failed to find
it. We, for our part, are not over anxious to rob these people of their
comfortable conviction. But to men who were worthy (men both of high and
low degree) we have repeatedly proved the reality of our Art by incontestable
ocular evidence. Let me warn those who wish to follow the true method in
studying our Art, airways to read with constant reference to natural facts,
and never, under any circumstances, to do anything contrary to Nature If
the Sages say that fire does not burn, they must not believe it; for Nature
is greater than the Sages; but if they say that it is the property of fire
to dry and heat things, they will accept this statement, because it is
in accordance with the truth of Nature --- and the facts of Nature are
always simple and plain. If any one came and taught you to make this Stone,
as though he were giving you a receipt for making cheese out of milk, he
might speak more plainly than I have done; but I am compelled to veil and
conceal my meaning because of the vow which my Master exacted of me.
<p>My last words shall be addressed to you who have already made some progress
in this Art. Have you been where the bridegroom has been married to the
bride, and the nuptials were celebrated in the house of Nature? Have you
heard how the vulgar have seen this Sulphur, as much as have you who have
taken such pains to seek it? If you wish that even old women should practise
your philosophy, shew the dealbation of these sulphurs, and say openly
to the common people: Behold, the water is divided, and the Sulphur has
gone forth; when it returns it will be whiter than snow, and will congeal
the water. Burn the Sulphur with incombustible sulphur, wash it, and make
it white and purple until the Sulphur becomes Mercury, and the Mercury
Sulphur, and you can proceed to quicken it with the soul of gold. Our Mercury
must be corrected by means of Sulphur-otherwise it is unprofitable. A prince
without a people is a wretched sight-and so is an Alchemist without Sulphur
and Mercury. If you understand me, I have spoken.
<p>The Alchemist went home, bewailed the broken Stone, and his folly in
not asking Saturn about the Salt of the Sages, and the way of distinguishing
between it and ordinary salt. The rest he related to his wife.
<p>Conclusion Every student of this Art should first carefully read what
is said-in this and other Treatises -- about the creation, operation, properties,
and effects of the four elements; otherwise he cannot apprehend the nature
of the three principles, or find the substance of the Stone, or understand
its development. God has created the elements out of chaos; nature has
evolved the three principles out of the elements; and out of these principles
she makes all things, and gives power to her beloved disciples to produce
marvelous preparations. If Nature produces metals out of the principles,
Art must follow her example. It is one of the rules of Nature to act through
intermediate substances; and this book should enable the student to judge
what substances are intermediate between the elements and metals, and between
meals and the Stone. The difference between gold and water is great, that
between water and mercury not so great, and that between gold and mercury
very small, for mercury is the habitation of gold, water the habitation
of mercury, and sulphur is that which coagulates mercury. The whole arcanum
lies hidden in the Sulphur of the Sages, which is also contained its the
inmost part of their Mercury, which has to be prepared in a certain way
that shall be described on another occasion.
<p>I have not written this Treatise with the object of refuting the ancient
Sages, but only for the purpose of correcting, explaining, and supplementing
their statements. After all, they were only men and they sometimes did
make assertions which can now no longer be maintained. For instance, when
Albertus Magnus says that gold was once found to have developed in the
teeth of a dead man, he is out of harmony with the possibilities of Nature;
for an animal substance can never develop into a mineral. It is true that
animals and vegetables contain sulphur and mercury, as well as minerals;
but these principles are animal and vegetable, not mineral. If there were
no animal sulphur in man, the mercury of his blood could not be congealed
into flesh and bones; and if plants contained no vegetable sulphur, their
mercury or water (sap) would not be congealed into leaves and flowers.
The three kinds of sulphur are essentially the same, but, like the three
mercuries, they are differentiated according to the three kingdoms, and
cannot act outside their own kingdoms. Each kind of mercury can be coagulated
by none but its own sulphur, and if gold was found in the teeth of a dead
man it must have been introduced in an artificial manner --- either as
gold, or in the shape of some other metal which by the gradual action of
its own metallic sulphur on its metallic mercury, was afterwards transmuted
into gold. It is mistaken impressions and superstitious notions, like this
one of Albertus Magnus, that we have set ourselves to correct in this Treatise,
by stating once for all the true facts of animal, vegetable, and mineral
development.
<p>Let the painstaking student be satisfied to have received a true account
of the origin of the Three Principles. There is no greater help towards
a successful end than a good beginning. I have in this Treatise started
the student on the right road, and given him clear and practical directions.
With God's blessing, and by dint of diligent and persevering study, he
may now fairly hope to reach the glorious goal. But I, having told out
all that is lawful for me to utter, now commit myself to the mercy of a
loving Creator, who will receive me to Himself; and I commend the gentle
and pious Reader to the same great Father of All, to whom be praise and
glory, through the endless succession of the ages.</blockquote>
