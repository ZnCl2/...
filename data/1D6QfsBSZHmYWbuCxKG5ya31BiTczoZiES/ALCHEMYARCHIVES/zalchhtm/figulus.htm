<blockquote>Wilt thou, by God's grace alone
<br>Obtain the Stone of the Philosophers?
<br>If so, seek it not in vegetables or animals,
<br>In sulphur, quicksilver, and minerals;
<br>Vitriol, alum, and salt are of no value;
<br>Lead, tin, iron and copper profit nothing;
<br>Silver and gold have no efficacy.
<br>Hyle or Chaos will accomplish it all.
<br>It is enclosed in our salt spring,
<br>In the tree of the Moon and of the Sun.
<br>I call it the Flower of Honey,
<br>The Flower known to the Wise.
<br>In fine, the Flower and Honey
<br>Are the Sulphur and Quicksilver of the Wise,
<br>Even water and earth,
<br>With the whitish seed of all metals.
<br>The water is volatile, the earth fixed;
<br>One can effect nothing without the other.
<br>Both are born of a root having a white exterior.
<br>It produces all the virtues of the metals,
<br>Yet it is not dug from the ore
<br>Either with pickaxes or other instruments.
<br>In the place and spot where our Matter is found
<br>No other metal whatever exists.
<br>It is produced, with its virtue and efficacy,
<br>In Hyle or Chaos alone.
<br>Homer knew it well, and called it Moly.
<br>This, in its proper condition,
<br>Has a root altogether black.
<br>It is green, white and blood red.
<br>The god Mercury offered it to Ulysses,
<br>Even unto Ulysses in his wanderings,
<br>As a precaution against the sorcery of Circe.
<br>The gods also have bestowed it upon man
<br>As a singularly great gift,
<br>Designed to assuage and comfort him.
<br>Hence springs pleasing nectar,
<br>The drink of the goddesses.
<br>It is also termed Chelidonia,
<br>As a singular gift of Heaven.
<br>Solar Root is another name.
<br>The root is known to the wise:
<br>It receives high honours in astronomy,
<br>Is metaphorically likened to the planets,
<br>Lead, tin, copper and iron,
<br>Silver and gold, everything the wise have named.
<br>In the tongue of Chaldaea it is also called Azoth;
<br>In German it is a blessed spirit;
<br>In Latin, argent vive animate,
<br>That is to say, Mercury of the Philosophers.
<br>It is also named the herb Adrop,
<br>A well-known Chaldaean word,
<br>Signifying in our speech Saturn.
<br>Astronomically speaking, I must say
<br>That Saturn rules the earth.
<br>Metaphorically is our matter compared,
<br>Being the Red Lead and Red Earth,
<br>With fools despised and valueless.
<br>It is called the Red and Green Lion.
<br>It is well known as the Adamic Earth -
<br>A skilful production of the Wise Creator,
<br>Which doth contain and unite in one mass
<br>The powers of all natures.
<br>From this mass and red earth,
<br>Almighty God creates Adam.
<br>He has highly honoured our first father,
<br>Who is also called Microcosmus.
<br>You are to recognise the Red Earth as Adam;
<br>Later on, I will likewise disclose its preparation.
<br>With great courage kill the lion;
<br>But take its coagulated blood;
<br>The brilliancy of gold and its costliness,
<br>Separated from the centre of the putrefying earth;
<br>Dissolve it with the greatest diligence;
<br>Imitate the Creator of Nature so wise,
<br>Who will vouchsafe to enlighten our understanding,
<br>That we may separate the dry from the moist.
<br>Thus water is produced from earth,
<br>The volatile from the fixed,
<br>The animated spirit on the earth.
<br>Water and earth, two visible elements,
<br>Have, by God's grace and care,
<br>Fire and air concealed within them.
<br>They are also purely impregnated
<br>With the fifth invisible nature.
<br>But, to proceed to the end of the work,
<br>Marry the woman with the man,
<br>Our Adam with clear Eve,
<br>Both being absolutely naked,
<br>For then Nature herself, being clean and pure,
<br>Rejoices with her own nature.
<p>The animated spirit dissolves the body,
<br>The body coagulates the spirit.
<br>This is the sole Mercury,
<br>Which is the Foundation of the Stone of the Wise.
<br>It becomes black, white, green and red,
<br>Is itself Proteus, the God of the sea,
<br>Who, being caught, so wondrously
<br>Transforms himself into a thousand shapes;
<br>That is, it dissolves and coagulates itself,
<br>Sublimates and calcines,
<br>Mortifies and vivifies,
<br>Washes and incerates,
<br>Clarifies and fixes.
<br>In all these things
<br>Heaven and earth are concerned,
<br>And the Sun and Moon
<br>Become dark and black as a raven:
<br>Heaven and earth are melted quite away:
<br>Truly, in the Hyle or Chaos
<br>There is most wonderful strife
<br>Of the elements in all directions.
<br>Water covers all the earth,
<br>But in order that the moist may become dry,
<br>Our strong giants maintain
<br>Incessant and unwearying contests
<br>With our wondrously small dwarf,
<br>Who, finally, by divine miracle,
<br>Conquers and overcomes
<br>And captures them all, both slays and binds.
<br>Out of the destroyed rubbish
<br>God creates a new Heaven and Earth.
<br>The New Jerusalem is built
<br>With transparent clear gold,
<br>Also with pure precious stone.
<br>Here is placed the famed Stone of the Wise,
<br>The unique bird, the good Phoenix,
<br>Who by the glow of the fire
<br>Is slain and born again,
<br>And becomes a real Salamander,
<br>Who now lives in the fire.
<br>This is filius solis, child of the sun,
<br>Who with his singular power
<br>Works miracles and great wonders,
<br>And can expel all sicknesses
<br>In human and metallic bodies.
<br>With glorified body, flesh and blood,
<br>He purifies all that is corporal.
<br>The immortal Adam, highly endowed,
<br>Tinges common gold and silver,
<br>So that they thereby may become fruitful,
<br>To bear their blessed likeness on the Earth.</blockquote>
