<p>Nature begets a mineral in the bowels of the earth. There are two kinds
of it, which are found in many districts of Europe. The best which has
been offered to me, which also has been found genuine in experimentation,
is externally in the figure of the greater world, and is in the eastern
part of the sphere of the Sun. The other, in the Southern Star, is now
in its first efflorescence. The bowels of the earth thrust this forth through
its surface. It is found red in its first coagulation, and in it lie hid
all the flowers and colours of the minerals. Much has been written about
it by the philosophers, for it is of a cold and moist nature, and agrees
with the element of water.
<p>So far as relates to the knowledge of it and experiment with it, all
the philosophers before me, though they have aimed at it with their missiles,
have gone very wide of the mark. They believed that Mercury and Sulphur
were the mother of all metals, never even dreaming of making mention meanwhile
of a third; and yet when the water is separated from it by Spagyric Art
the truth is plainly revealed, though it was unknown to Galen or to Avicenna.
But if, for the sake of our excellent physicians, we had to describe only
the name, the composition; the dissolution, and coagulation, as in the
beginning of the world Nature proceeds with all growing things, a whole
year would scarcely suffice me, and, in order to explain these things,
not even the skins of numerous cows would be adequate.
<p>Now, I assert that in this mineral are found three principles, which
are Mercury, Sulphur, and the Mineral Water which has served to naturally
coagulate it. Spagyric science is able to extract this last from its proper
juice when it is not altogether matured, in the middle of the autumn, just
like a pear from a tree. The tree potentially contains the pear. If the
Celestial Stars and Nature agree , the tree first of all puts forth shoots
in the month of March; then it thrusts out buds, and when these open the
flower appears, and so on in due order until in autumn the pear grows ripe.
So is it with the minerals. These are born, in like manner, in the bowels
of the earth. Let the Alchemists who are seeking the Treasure of Treasures
carefully note this. I will shew them the way, its beginning, its middle,
and its end. In the following treatise I will describe the proper Water,
the proper Sulphur, and the proper Balm thereof. By means of these three
the resolution and composition are coagulated into one.
<center>
<p><b>Concerning the Sulphur of Cinnabar.</b></center>

<p>Take mineral Cinnabar and prepare it in the following manner. Cook it
with rain water in a stone vessel for three hours. Then purify it carefully,
and dissolve it in Aqua Regis, which is composed of equal parts of vitriol,
nitre, and sal ammoniac. Another formula is vitriol, saltpetre, alum, and
common salt.
<p>Distil this in an alembic. Pour it on again, and separate carefully
the pure from the impure thus. Let it putrefy for a month in horse-dung;
then separate the elements in the following manner. If it puts forth its
sign1, commence the distillation by means of an alembic with a fire of
the first degree. The water and the air will ascend; the fire and the earth
will remain at the bottom. Afterwards join them again, and gradually treat
with the ashes. So the water and the air will again ascend first, and afterwards
the element of fire, which expert artists recognise. The earth will remain
in the bottom of the vessel. This collect there. It is what many seek after
and few find.
<p>This dead earth in the reverberatory you will prepare according to the
rules of Art, and afterwards add fire of the first degree for five days
and nights. When these have elapsed you must apply the second degree for
the same number of days and nights, and proceed according to Art with the
material enclosed. At length you will find a volatile salt, like a thin
alkali, containing in itself the Astrum of fire and earth. Mix this with
the two elements that have been preserved, the water and the earth. Again
place it on the ashes for eight days and eight nights, and you will find
that which has been neglected by many Artists. Separate this according
to your experience, and according to the rules of the Spagyric Art, and
you will have a white earth, from which its colour has been extracted.
Join the element of fire and salt to the alkalised earth. Digest in a pelican
to extract the essence. Then a new earth will be deposited, which put aside.
<center>
<p><b>Concerning the Red Lion</b>.</center>

<p>Afterwards take the lion in the pelican which also is found [at] first,
when you see its tincture, that is to say, the element of fire which stands
above the water, the air, and the earth. Separate it from its deposit by
trituration. Thus you will have the true aurum potabile. Sweeten this with
the alcohol of wine poured over it, and then distil in an alembic until
you perceive no acidity to remain in the Aqua Regia.
<p>This Oil of the Sun, enclosed in a retort hermetically sealed, you must
place for elevation that it may be exalted and doubled in its degree. Then
put the vessel, still closely shut, in a cool place. Thus it will not be
dissolved, but coagulated. Place it again for elevation and coagulation,
and repeat this three times. Thus will be produced the Tincture of the
Sun, perfect in its degree. Keep this in its own place.
<center>
<p><b>Concerning the Red Lion</b>.</center>

<p>Take the vitriol of Venus, carefully prepared according to the rules
of Spagyric Art; and add thereto the elements of water and air which you
have reserved. Resolve, and set to putrefy for a month according to instructions.
When the putrefaction is finished, you will behold the sign of the elements.
Separate, and you will soon see two colours, namely, white and red. The
red is above the white. The red tincture of the vitriol is so powerful
that it reddens all white bodies, and whitens all red ones, which is wonderful.
<p>Work upon this tincture by means of a retort, and you will perceive
a blackness issue forth. Treat it again by means of the retort, repeating
the operation until it comes out whitish. Go on, and do not despair of
the work. Rectify until you find the true, clear Green Lion, which you
will recognise by its great weight. You will see that it is heavy and large.
This is the Tincture, transparent gold. You will see marvellous signs of
this Green Lion, such as could be bought by no treasures of the Roman Leo.
Happy he who has learnt how to find it and use it for a tincture!
<p>This is the true and genuine Balsam5, the Balsam of the Heavenly Stars,
suffering no bodies to decay, nor allowing leprosy, gout, or dropsy to
take root. It is given in a dose of one grain, if it has been fermented
with Sulphur of Gold.
<p>Ah, Charles the German, where is your treasure? Where are your philosophers?
Where your doctors? Where are your decocters of woods, who at least purge
and relax? Is your heaven reversed? Have your stars wandered out of their
course, and are they straying in another orbit, away from the line of limitation,
since your eyes are smitten with blindness, as by a carbuncle, and other
things making a show of ornament, beauty, and pomp? If your artists only
knew that their prince Galen --- they call none like him --- was sticking
in hell, from whence he has sent letters to me, they would make the sign
of the cross upon themselves with a fox's tail. In the same way your Avicenna
sits in the vestibule of the infernal portal; and I have disputed with
him about his aurum potabile, his Tincture of the Philosophers, his Quintessence,
and Philosophers' Stone, his Mithridatic, his Theriac, and all the rest.
O, you hypocrites, who despise the truths taught you by a true physician,
who is himself instructed by Nature, and is a son of God himself! Come,
then, and listen, impostors who prevail only by the authority of your high
positions! After my death, my disciples will burst forth and drag you to
the light, and shall expose your dirty drugs, wherewith up to this time
you have compassed the death of princes, and the most invincible magnates
of the Christian world. Woe for your necks in the day of judgment! I know
that the monarchy will be mine. Mine, too, will be the honour and glory.
Not that I praise myself: Nature praises me. Of her I am born; her I follow.
She knows me, and I know her. The light which is in her I have beheld in
her; outside, too, I have proved the same in the figure of the microcosm,
and found it in that universe.
<p>But I must proceed with my design in order to satisfy my disciples to
the full extent of their wish. I willingly do this for them, if only skilled
in the light of Nature and thoroughly practised in astral matters, they
finally become adepts in philosophy, which enables them to know the nature
of every kind of water.
<p>Take, then, of this liquid of the minerals which I have described, four
parts by weight; of the Earth of red Sol two parts; of Sulphur of Sol one
part. Put these together into a pelican, congelate, and dissolve them three
times. Thus you will have the Tincture of the Alchemists. We have not here
described its weight: but this is given in the book on Transmutations.
<p>So, now, he who has one to a thousand ounces of the Astrum Solis shall
also tinge his own body of Sol.
<p>If you have the Astrum of Mercury, in the same manner, you will tinge
the whole body of common Mercury. If you have the Astrum of Venus you will,
in like manner, tinge the whole body of Venus, and change it into the best
metal. These facts have all been proved. The same must also be understood
as to the Astra of the other planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Luna, and
the rest. For tinctures are also prepared from these: concerning which
we now make no mention in this place, because we have already dwelt at
sufficient length upon them in the book on the Nature of Things and in
the Archidoxies. So, too, the first entity of metals and terrestrial minerals
have been made, sufficiently clear for Alchemists to enable them to get
the Alchemists' Tincture.
<p>This work, the Tincture of the Alchemists, need not be one of nine months;
but quickly, and without any delay, you may go on by the Spaygric Art of
the Alchemists, and, in the space of forty days, you can fix this alchemical
substance, exalt it, putrefy it, ferment it, coagulate it into a stone,
and produce the Alchemical Phoenix. But it should be noted well that the
Sulphur of Cinnabar becomes the Flying Eagle, whose wings fly away without
wind, and carry the body of the phoenix to the nest of the parent, where
it is nourished by the element of fire, and the young ones dig out its
eyes: from whence there emerges a whiteness, divided in its sphere, into
a sphere and life out of its own heart, by the balsam of its inward parts,
according to the property of the cabalists.
