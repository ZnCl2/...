<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will divide the whole of the <i>Art</i> into these
parts: The first shall contain things substantially and essentially Constituting
the Work: The second the disposition of them: The things Essentially Constituting
the <i>Stone</i>, are a <i>Body</i> or Mature <i>Sulphur</i>, or <i>red
Brass</i> and Water, or Immature <i>Mercury</i>, or white <i>Brass</i>,
to which a Vessel is added, a Furnace and Triple Fire. The Disposition
of these things, Considers the Weight and the Regimen. The <i>Pondus</i>
is two-fold, the <i>Regimen</i> is twofold: Those things which perfect
these Operations, are <i>Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction,
Putrefaction, Distillation, Coagulation, Sublimation, Fixation</i>, and
<i>Exaltation</i>,
of which the two first, are made especially by a Temperate Incomburent
and altering <i>Ignition</i> of the Fire; heating the <i>King’s bath</i>
and Changing him first into a subtile <i>viscous</i> Earth, then into <i>Mineral
Water</i>, diversely coloured, and this is called a Fire against Nature.
The three Operations which follow are made from the Combining of the first
and third Fire, to wit, of the Natural and Contra-natural, which being
so joined together, make an unnatural Fire, by Circulating the Matter every
day, and separating the more subtile from the Thick till all be of the
same Temperament, and then Conjoyning the things separated, impregnating
them, and so putrefying them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five last Operations are made by the Fire of
Nature, daily increasing and Predominating, which first Circumacts the
putrefied Matter daily and cleanseth it from Filth, by a n open ascension,
and descension, which therefore is called Distillation, Volatilization,
Ablution, Mundification, Cohobation, Imbibition, Cibation, Hunectation
of the Earth. And this is done so long by the heat, until the Siccity begins
to Coagulate, which is called Inspissation, which by a longer Concoction,
or Sublimation, brings a fixity, whose Bound is Exaltation: This is not
the change of an inferior place, for the Superior, but of the most vile
things, to make the most Noble.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all our Operations and successive Dispositions,
which by some are called so many Regimens, which name if any one had rather
impose, he may: however know there is only a double fire, Natural and against
Nature, of which the Latter Acts first, because the other is not brought
to light, but by this, and Putrefaction must go before Regeneration; and
when these two fight one another, they make an Unnatural fire, and from
this Contention rises Putrefaction: and after this is a Glorious Regeneration
in which the Sulphur and Water become one thing, and also receive a Congealation,
from no fire but a Natural.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore our Body which is commonly Called <i>Terra
Lemnia</i>, perfects the whole work: but it can in no wise be moistened
but in its own Water, which Water is truly <i>Pluvial</i>, not such as
the common people knows to get, but ours, which none ever saw, but a true
<i>Philosopher</i>,
believe me for I speak the truth, Fools know how to Extract many Waters,
to wit wetting the hands, but our Water is the Life of all things, about
which thou must take pains, the n neither <i>Sol</i>, nor <i>Luna</i> will
be wanting to supply thee with Riches.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will tell thee, and that faithfully, what kind
of Water this is, it is the Water of <i>Salt Petre</i>, which is known
as <i>Mercury</i>, but in the heart a pure infernal Fire: but have a care
thou be not deceived by <i>Quicksilver</i>, but understand that <i>Mercury</i>,
which the returning Sun cefuseth every where in the Month of <i>March</i>.
Gather thou it in the Month of <i>October</i>, because then surely it is
found ripe, and the most precious Treasure in the whole World.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that I may describe our <i>Mercury</i> to thee,
our Rain Water so that thou mayst find it, know that it is before the eyes
of the whole World, that yet are Ignorant thereof, or at least, does take
the vulgar for it, and <i>deturpates</i> it with various Tortures, but
neglects our true <i>Mercury</i> in its season, therefore it never perfects
our <i>Magistery</i>. For the common <i>Alchymists</i> does look upon it
with a blew look; whence it comes to pass, that they scorn it: but it astonisheth
the Sons of Learning with its Splendor, and is greatly accounted of by
them, therefore it is a vile thing, and yet the most precious, which no
one ever contemned without a great judgement of God.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou when thou seest it don’t despise it because
it will appear very durty, and if thou therefore dispise it, thou shalt
be deprived of the <i>Magistery</i>, but if thou dost greatly esteem this
contemptible thing, then indeed it shall seem Glorious, having changed
it countenance: For our <i>Water</i> is a most clean Virgin, and is loved
by many, but she meets all her Wooers, Cloathed in sordid Garments, that
by this means she may distinguish <i>Philosophers</i> from Fools, for whosoever
shall behold nothing but externally, will scorn him as unworthy of such
a Secret, since <i>Whores</i> shew themselves to their <i>Wooers</i>, drest
in splendid Garments; but this chast and most precious <i>Maid</i>. Seems
outwardly foul, but is inwardly fair, which indeed cheats many Fools. But
whatsoever Mental man, can see the Spirit which lyes hid, under the patent
<i>body</i>
will not esteem her little, also our Virgin will look upon him as a Friend,
and putting off her filthiness, will shine most amiable, whom then none
but a fool must admire and love, for she will bestow upon him infinite
Riches, and perfect health. Therefore honour ye this Female, the <i>Sister</i>
and <i>Wife</i> of our <i>King</i>, to whom if you be assistant in putting
off her dregs, she will get most splendid Garments for her self, and bestow
infinite Riches upon thee. Therefore this our
<i>Queen</i> is clean above
measure, whom if you shall behold, you will think you look upon a certain
Heavenly Body, for she is indeed the Heaven or the fifth Essence of <i>Philosophers</i>,
whose brightness you cannot imagine, unless you see it: believe me for
I have seen her Snowy Splendor with my Eyes, touched with my hands, then
which nothing can be thought fairer. Our Water is then truly <i>Pontick,
Serene, Christaline</i>, pure and clean, which not so in its Nature as
we make it by our Art; and it is our Sea, our hidden Fountain, out of which
our <i>Gold</i> naturally is Created, when yet it prefers its self to <i>Gold</i>,
and conquers it, and in the hour of its Nativity, Gold is joined with it,
and is washed in it, and both increaseth together into a Stout <i>Hero</i>,
which neither
<i>Caesar</i> nor the <i>Pope</i> can buy with Money. Therefore
with all they strength get this Water, of which an Ounce is worth above
a Thousand Pound, because by this alone, without any other Labour, except
the Addition of a perfect clean, pure body, thou maist perfect our most
Honored <i>Stone</i>, to which no Treasure in the World can be equaled.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is need of profound Meditation before thou
canst conceive our Sea, to wit its <i>Flux</i> and <i>Reflux</i>: But if
thou be diligent, by the help of God, thou shalt obtain thy desire; I for
my part, after I knew the Field in general, where this our Secret Fountain
did Purl, yet I did not learn to get it out, till after a year and a half,
giving my self, to daily study and profound Contemplations, because the
Fiery Furnace of the wise men lay hid from me long: but after I knew this,
and how it was fitted to its proper Vessel, after a few days I beheld the
admirable Brightness of our Water, which being seen I could not but be
amazed, for as in the Practice, so it is in the Theory, and on the contrary:
for he that exactly knows the Magistery of this Water, no Words or Secrets
of the <i>Philosophers</i>; Sayings, Writings or Enigmas, will be concealed
from him; so whosoever hath once made up our Water, nothing remains to
be done, but to cast in a clean Body in a just quantity, shut the Vessel
and so let it stand, till the Complement of the Work. But we have another
twofold <i>Fire</i>, which thou shalt easily know, as soon as thou hast
Learned this first: but that we may return to the Water, in which believe
me, the whole secret Consists, which Water although it be one, yet is not
simple but Compound, to wit of the Vessel and <i>Fire</i> of Philosophers
to which a third is added, namely the Bond. When therefore we speak of
our Vessel, understand our Water, when of the <i>Fire</i>, in like manner
understand Water and when we Dispute of the <i>Furnace</i> we would have
nothing Diverse, or divided from the Water. Therefore the Vessel is one,
the Furnace is one, the Fire one, and all these are one to wit Water.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the fire Digesteth, the Vessel Whiteneth,
and Penetrates, and the <i>Furnace</i> or <i>Bond</i> Encompasseth and
includeth all, and the <i>Fire</i> is <i>Mercury</i>, the Vessel also <i>Mercury</i>,
lastly the same <i>Furnace</i> is Mercury, and Note well, there is no fire
in the whole work but <i>Mercury</i>, when notwithstanding, the fire is
manifold, and the water manifold: therefore as well fire as water is diversified
by their virtue, in the work; as in Number, so they agree in one and the
same Gender, to wit <i>Mercury</i>, therefore our <i>Fire</i> is Living,
our <i>Vessel</i> Living, our <i>Furnace</i> Living, and all these are
one.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know also dearest! That there is only one thing in
the whole world, in the which this our <i>Mercury</i> is to be found, it
is of a like Essence with <i>Gold</i>, unlike in Substance, by converting
the Elements thereof, thou shalt find what thou seekest. Joyn the Heaven
with the Earth, upon a Fire of friendship, and in the midst of the Firmament,
thou shalt see <i>Hermes</i> his <i>bird</i>. Do not confound the Natures,
but divide them and joyn them again, and thou shalt Reign in <i>Honour</i>
all thy Life; hear therefore this great <i>Secret</i>, in the <i>Southern
Coast</i> is found a very high <i>Mountain</i>, very near to the <i>Sun</i>,
which is one of the <i>seven</i>, and highest but one: This Mountain of
which we speak is of a very hot temperature, because it is not far from
the <i>Sun</i>, and in this Mountain a <i>Vapour</i> or <i>Spirit</i> is
shut up, which highly necessary for our Work; but it does not ascend unless
the <i>Earth</i> be digged Knee deep in the top of the Mountain, but if
this be done, the Spirit or thin <i>Exhalation ascends</i>, which being
<i>congealed</i>
by the <i>Air</i>, drop by drop, runs into most clear
<i>Water</i>, warm
like a <i>Bath</i>, which is presently gathered, for it is the true <i>Caduce
of Mercury</i>, with which he works Wonders; this is our <i>Water</i>,
our <i>Fire</i>, our <i>Furnace</i> and it is our
<i>Mercury</i>, and not
the <i>Vulgars</i>; but the hot and humid Liquor of the most pure Salt,
which we name <i>Mercury</i>; because comparing it with the <i>Sun</i>,
it’s immature and Frigid. Verily I say unto thee, except the <i>Almighty</i>
had Created this <i>Mercury</i>, the <i>Transmutation of Metals</i> were
impossible, because the <i>Sun</i> does not <i>tinge</i> unless it be <i>tinged</i>.
But he is not <i>tinged</i> but by this our
<i>Water</i> alone. O this
blessed <i>Humidity</i>! Which is the <i>Philosophical</i> Heaven, whence
wise men have drawn their Inestimable <i>Dainties</i>! O permanent <i>Water!
Dissolving</i> and amending <i>Sol</i>, our <i>Nitre</i> and wonderful
<i>Sal
Petre</i>! Whose price is Inestimable yet is little esteemed. Therefore
the thing is vile and yet very <i>Precious</i>, whom our <i>Sol</i> Loves
as his only <i>Bride</i>, whose <i>virtue</i> if the vulgar knew, they
would not sell a <i>drahm</i> for a Thousand <i>Ounces</i> of <i>Silver</i>;
for it is most precious Gold Lively and <i>penetrating</i>, therefore it
turns the <i>Body</i> of <i>Gold</i> into a meer <i>Spirit</i>, and is
joined in <i>Marriage</i>, as the <i>Woman</i> to the <i>Husband</i>, whose
fairness <i>Sol</i> admires, and rejoices in her, and for Love kills his
own <i>Wife</i>, and she moved with Love makes him alive, and is <i>impregnated</i>
by him, Conceives and grows big, also brings forth a Son a most <i>serene
King</i>. O happy they who can go to this Fountain of our <i>Water</i>!
For if they shall Drink of it, and shall Eat afterwards a little piece
of fat Flesh, they shall reign as Princes all their Life on the Earth.
Therefore the whole <i>secret</i> of our <i>Work</i> consists in knowing
this our Sea, which who ever is Ignorant of, he hath long ago Destined
his Money to perdition, if he does spend any about this Work. For our <i>Ocean</i>
draws its Original, from one Mountain and that a very high one, as I have
said above. But if ascending to the Top thou dig Knee Deep, a Certain <i>Exhalation</i>
or <i>white fume</i> will ascend, which will perfect the whole <i>Magistery</i>,
but there remains another Secret, which thou art obliged not to be ignorant
of, that thou maist obtain thy desire, to wit, how thou must <i>dig</i>
in the <i>Mountain</i>, since that the Earth in the Superfice of the <i>Mountain</i>,
is to be cut with no Blow, for such is his Dryness, that it is <i>Concreted</i>
by the means of <i>Heat</i>, into a Substance harder than <i>Flint</i>.
Attend therefore to this Secret, in <i>Saturnine</i> places is found a
certain <i>Herb</i> called <i>Saturnia</i>, whose branches appear dry,
but Juice abounds in the Root, gather this Herb together with the Root
and carry it with thee, until thou come to the foot of the <i>Mountain</i>,
under which by the Ministry of <i>Vulcan</i>, thou shalt dig and Bury the
herb, which presently goes through the pores of the Mountain, by loosing
the earth thereof, then at length, Climbing to the Top, thou shalt easily
Bore Knee deep, and shalt pour so much Fat and dry Water, that descending
to the Bottom of the Mountain it may wet the Herb there laid; which presently
being made moist, together with the Water, ascends like smoak, and hurries
with it the Spirit of the Mountain, carrying it up with it, which Spirit
is a fiery Virtue, mingling it self with the water, and inhabiting therein,
and
it is the Water into which thou shalt cast thy Bond, or the <i>Vessel</i>
or <i>Furnace</i>; the <i>spirit of Saturnia</i> is a whitening <i>fume</i>,
and the vapour of the Mountain is fire, and all these are fire, so thou
hast <i>Saturnia</i> a <i>Vegetable, Royal</i> and <i>Mineral Herb</i>,
of which with fat Flesh is made such a <i>Broth</i>, to which no Dainties
in the World may be Compared. Now thou hast the whole <i>secret</i> of
our <i>Water</i>, described under an <i>enigmatical Discourse</i>, yet
not so <i>obscurely</i> but thou maist Easily if thou be diligent and Learned,
by <i>Contemplations</i> and <i>Experiments</i> perfect the <i>Work</i>.
For all these are the true material <i>Principles</i> of our <i>Stone</i>,
besides which, nothing can or ought to enter, into our <i>Work</i>: to
wit, the <i>King</i> and the <i>Water</i>, which is the <i>Bath</i> of
the <i>King</i>, &amp; know that our <i>Water</i> is a <i>Vessel</i>, as
our <i>King</i> is Contained in it; and a Furnace as our <i>Fire</i> is
included in it; and our <i>Fire</i>, as the <i>Virtue</i> or Spirit of
the <i>Mountain</i> Inhabits in it; and the <i>Female</i>, as it contains
the <i>Vapour of Vegetable Saturnia</i>, which is very friendly to <i>Sol</i>;
and <i>Penetrates, Whitens</i> and <i>Mollifies</i> him and makes him to
cast out <i>Sperm</i>; then the <i>Fiery Virtue</i> which is shut up in
the <i>Water</i> begins to work upon our <i>Body</i> so <i>reduced</i>,
by wasting it and Mortifying, by burning and Putrefying, or rather exciting
to these things until the innate heat of <i>Sol</i>, is deduced from power
into Act, which <i>dealbates, Coagulates, Fixeth</i> and <i>Tingeth</i>:
and therefore our <i>Stone</i> is called the <i>world</i> because it contains
both the <i>Agent</i> and <i>Patient</i> in it. It is the moving and the
moved, Active and Passive, Fixt and Volatile, Mature and Crude, one whereof
<i>succours</i>
the other, and the one is amended by the other, because both is <i>Homogeneous</i>
in its self. For <i>Sulphur </i>and <i>Mercury
</i>are the same in <i>Water
</i>and
in a <i>Body</i>, in <i>Identity </i>of the <i>Genus</i>, and only are
diversified by <i>Decoction</i>. Keep this
<i>Secret</i>. Therefore we
do not to that end, order <i>Crude </i>and
<i>Volatile Mercury</i>, to
be mingled with <i>Mature </i>and <i>fixt Sulphur</i>, that we might affirm
that <i>Sulphur </i>is different in one and the other, and the <i>Mercury
</i>different
also; For where would then the <i>Homogeneity</i>, of <i>Metals
</i>be,
which we affirm in our <i>Stone</i>, but therefore we mix these two Species,
that we by our <i>Art</i>, might Perfect <i>Gold</i>, a thousand Degrees
more, in a far shorter space, than <i>Nature </i>has formed <i>simple Gold
</i>in the <i>Mines</i>. For <i>Nature </i>from only
<i>Crude, Humid</i>,
and <i>Frigid Mercury</i>, without any Addition, Generates
<i>Gold </i>by
a long <i>Decoction</i>, under the Earth: But Art to contract the work,
throws in <i>Mature </i>and <i>fixed Sulphur </i>to<i> Mercury
</i>made
most pure by <i>Art</i>, and so <i>Extracts </i>the most <i>digested
</i>virtue
of <i>Sulphur by Mercury</i>, which <i>Sulphureal Virtue</i>, strongly
Changes and perfects <i>Mercury </i>into a Compleat <i>Elixir</i>. Observe
therefore, the <i>Work </i>and the <i>Process </i>thereof, whence thou
shalt understand the <i>Cause </i>of the wonderful Abbreviation of the
<i>Work,
Gold </i>is a <i>Body </i>hot and dry, <i>Luna Cold &amp; moist, Mercury
</i>the Medium of <i>Carrying </i>the <i>Tinctures</i>: The <i>Body
</i>of
<i>Sol </i>is most digested, of <i>Luna imperfect </i>and
<i>immature</i>;
<i>Mercury
</i>the Bond, by which these two Contraries are United. Join
<i>Luna </i>to
<i>Mercury</i>, with a due and Convenient
<i>Ignition</i>, and mingle them
so, that <i>Luna </i>and <i>Mercury </i>may become one
<i>Mercury</i>,
retaining the <i>fire </i>in it self, and all the <i>feces
</i>and <i>superfluities
</i>will fall from <i>Mercury</i>, and he shall become clear, as the <i>tear
</i>of the <i>Eye</i>, although not <i>Diaphanous</i>, then lastly mingle
this <i>Mercury </i>with <i>Gold</i>, in which is <i>Luna
</i>and <i>Fire</i>,
and then the hot and Dry will love the <i>cold </i>and
<i>moist</i>, and
will lye down together, in one Bed, that is in the <i>Fire of friendship</i>,
and the <i>Man </i>will be dissolved upon the Woman, and the woman will
be Coagulated upon the Man, and then the Spirit and the Body will be one
by Commixtion. Go on afterwards with that foot thou hast begun, and so
often Reiterate the <i>Heaven
</i>upon its <i>Earth</i>, until the <i>Spirit
</i>put on the <i>Body</i>, and both be fixt together. For then our <i>Stone
</i>is perfect, and indued with Regal <i>Virtue</i>, the which no price
can Buy. For <i>Mercury </i>is the water of all <i>Metals</i>, they being
<i>decocted </i>in it: And even as simple water, which in its own <i>Nature
</i>is cold and moist, which notwithstanding if it be mixt in <i>decoction
</i>with any <i>Vegetable</i>, receives and puts on other Qualities of
Spirit of life, which resides in the water, goes out by <i>Decoction
</i>into
the <i>water</i>, and the
<i>water Convertibly</i>, receives its
<i>Nature</i>:
Yet the thick and
<i>Corporeal Earthly </i>part of the <i>substance decocted</i>,
is not that <i>spirit </i>that Changes the quality of the
<i>water</i>,
but is separable from the <i>matter </i>after <i>decoction</i>. In like
manner we must understand of <i>Argent Vive</i>, with its <i>Species
</i>yet
differently, for whatsoever <i>Metal </i>or <i>Mineral </i>shall be so
familiar with
<i>Mercury</i>, as to be mixt <i>per minima</i>, and
<i>decocted
with it</i>, that <i>Mercury</i>, according to the <i>Species
</i>of the
<i>Metal </i>so joined, puts on other Qualities, and will cast off his
own Dreggs. Therefore
<i>Metallick and Mineral species </i>are
<i>subordinately</i>,
and <i>subalternately
</i>to be <i>decocted </i>in it, and it is their
<i>water</i>, into which
<i>Mineral spirits </i>are emitted, by <i>Decoction</i>,
and so alter it no other ways then <i>Vegetables decocted </i>in their
simple water. Yet a <i>double difference </i>is to be noted, between the
foresaid <i>Decoctions</i>, first that <i>water </i>is not fixt with the
<i>Vegetables</i>, as <i>Mercury
</i>with <i>Metals</i>, therefore these
are of a stronger Composition than those. The Second, that in the <i>Decoction
of Vegetables </i>or <i>Animals</i>, the <i>water </i>being a <i>Diaphanous
</i>Humor, not only receives new Virtue and <i>Qualities</i>, but also
a different Colour to what it had. But it is not so in <i>Mercury
</i>for
its Nature is altered, but not its Colour nor form of <i>Flux</i>: but
the colour of a dissolved <i>Metal
</i>lyes under the form of <i>Liquid
Argent Vive</i>, and by its virtue does not appear. Therefore <i>Mercury
</i>first
acteth up a <i>Metal </i>by dissolving it, afterwards a <i>Metal</i> Acts
upon <i>Mercury </i>by <i>Coagulating
</i>it, and as in Dissolution, the
form and colour of the <i>Metal </i>lay under the form and colour of
<i>Mercury</i>,
so also in <i>Coagulation
</i>the form and Colour of <i>Mercury
</i>is
hid under the Colour and form of the <i>Metal</i>, so neither the Qualities
of the <i>Metal </i>in dissolution hinders the <i>Flux </i>of
<i>Mercury</i>,
nor the Qualities of <i>Mercury
</i>in <i>Coagulation</i>, hinder the <i>fixity
</i>of the <i>Metal</i>. Dost thou not see here a certain wonderful Agreement:
betwixt <i>Mercury
</i>and <i>Metals</i>, for they Love like <i>Mother
</i>and <i>Son, Sister
</i>and <i>Brother, Male </i>and <i>Female</i>,
therefore their <i>Bodies
</i>are made better by <i>Water </i>for the Generation
of all things is by <i>water</i>, and they take in it, and by it, a Latitude
of <i>Subtility</i>, that is a <i>Spiritual
</i>and <i>volatile Nature</i>,
and the <i>Water
</i>in like manner is amended by the Bodies, and is retained
and puts on a Corporeal nature, &amp; lo the whole compound is <i>matured
</i>together, when the <i>Agents
</i>become <i>Patients</i>, and on the
contrary. But the reason that the Colour of <i>Mercury </i>is not changed
in <i>Decoction
</i>by the Body Dissolved, is that, that the <i>Earth </i>and
<i>Water
</i>are <i>Homoeneous
</i>in <i>Mercury</i>, and so temperate
that neither can be separated from the other, and they are so strongly
Commixt, that in so wonderful a <i>tenuity
</i>of <i>matter</i>, there
is such great
<i>density </i>of <i>Substance</i>, as to hide the Colours,
whence if any proportion of <i>Mercury </i>be spoiled, either <i>destructively
</i>by
<i>deturpating </i>things or <i>Generatively
</i>with a <i>Body
</i>Appropriated to its self, it will manifest the <i>colour
</i>that is
thrown into the
<i>substance</i>. But there are <i>Proportions
</i>of <i>Mercury
</i>in respect both of <i>Earth </i>and <i>water</i>, in respect of the
second it flows and is <i>Liquid</i>, in respect of the first it <i>wets
nothing
</i>that it touches, but that which is of the
<i>Unity </i>of its
<i>Nature</i>. From what hath been said, all <i>Errors
</i>of <i>Operators
</i>in <i>Mercury
</i>are detected. For some Obstruct or Divide its <i>Homogeneity</i>,
by drying it with various <i>sublimations</i>, others Spoiling and Disproportionating
the <i>Earth</i>, to bring in a
<i>Transparency</i>. As many as do this,
do nothing but a <i>Sophistical work</i>. For <i>Mercury </i>is the <i>Sperm
</i>of
<i>Metals</i>, which
<i>Nature </i>with much <i>Sagacity </i>hath formed
in the <i>Veins </i>of the <i>Earth</i>, for <i>Metal</i>; Neither is any
thing wanting to it but <i>pure Digestion</i>, but it is not Digested unless
by <i>pure metallick incomburent Sulphur</i>, which indeed it hath in its
<i>Center</i>, by which Nature would form <i>Gold </i>in a long time; but
it is altogether unknown to man how he should make this by his
<i>Art</i>.
For although
<i>Gold </i>might be made of <i>Mercury </i>alone without
any addition, yet it would not be perfected but by long time and great
cost, which would be foolish to undergo in making <i>simple Gold</i>. Therefore
<i>Sulphur
</i>is the only thing in the world which <i>Nature
</i>has perfected,
that is familiar to <i>Mercury</i>. This therefore is mixt <i>Radically
</i>with it, and by this <i>Mercury </i>is <i>decocted</i>, and <i>Mercury
</i>because of the <i>Repugnance </i>of <i>Qualities </i>putrefies it,
and so by <i>Regeneration
</i>it rises again, not <i>Gold </i>as such as
is had in <i>Mines</i>, but spiritual <i>Penetrative </i>and <i>tinging</i>,
in so much that it easily enters all Imperfect <i>Metals</i>, when cast
upon them, which in a very short time, it Digesteth to the <i>Anatical
</i>proportion
of <i>Gold</i>, and the Dregs being cast off Restores them to perfect Health.
Thou seest therefore that <i>Mercury </i>is by no means to be <i>Disproportionated
</i>from
its own <i>Nature</i>, but to be <i>Matured
</i>and that not by it self
without any addition, and yet without any outward addition, but a <i>Radical
Union </i>of a clean <i>Body </i>with it <i>per minima</i>, which is done
by our secret Conjunction. Yet see you be not deceived, for this <i>Conjunction
</i>is not made by <i>manual operation</i>, but only by a Natural, man
not only helping, but also well understanding its Cause, therefore this
is called a Divine Work. Fools can confound the
<i>Body
</i>of <i>Gold
</i>with <i>Mercury</i>, and then they call it <i>animated Gold</i>, but
they find nothing in it. For although these two should remain together
a Thousand Years, nevertheless they would afterwards recede one from the
other in their own proper <i>Nature</i>. Therefore the Conjunction was
not <i>alterative </i>but only a <i>Confusion </i>of two between themselves.
But in our Operation, the <i>Spirit </i>of <i>Sol </i>Infuseth its self
into the <i>Spirit </i>of <i>Mercury</i>, so that they never depart the
one from the other afterwards, even as <i>water </i>doth not, being mixt
with <i>water</i>. Therefore in this <i>Operation </i>the greatest nay
the whole secret of the <i>Art </i>lyes hid. Attend therefore thou <i>Son
of Learning </i>and see warily that thou dost not err here. Therefore the
Body of <i>Sol </i>will never be joined with <i>Mercury </i>inwardly, unless
<i>Luna
</i>mediating,
or an imperfect Body and <i>Fire</i>; and this <i>Luna
</i>is the <i>Juice
</i>of the <i>water of Life</i>, which lyes hid in
<i>Mercury</i>, which
is sharpened by the fire, and is a <i>spirit </i>entering a <i>Body</i>,
and altering it and Compelling it to retain its Soul. Now therefore thou
seest of what <i>Mercury </i>we have hitherto spoken, not
<i>vulgar </i>but
<i>pluvial</i>;
which properly is not called <i>Mercury</i>, but <i>Mercurial water</i>;
for the <i>Mercury </i>of the <i>vulgar </i>is
<i>water</i>, but a <i>Spirit
</i>and <i>fiery virtue </i>is wanting to it, supply if thou canst that
which is wanting with all thy <i>Art</i>, then it will no longer be <i>Mercury
</i>of the <i>vulgar </i>but like to ours. But if thou canst not do this
let that <i>Mercury </i>alone, for thou canst expect nothing but loss from
it. Behold now God is my witness, I have told the whole <i>matter</i>,
which if thou art wise thou canst not be ignorant of. For vulgar <i>Mercury
</i>has seduced more, than any thing else; for the Workers herein have
found nothing, because they did not know our <i>Mercury</i>. But to return
to Conjunction, which believe me is the whole Secret of the
<i>Art</i>,
for the <i>Earth </i>is not united inseparably with the <i>water</i>, but
<i>water </i>adheres strongly to
<i>water</i>, hence it follows, that this
<i>laudable Conjunction </i>is not <i>celebrated </i>till after <i>Dissolution</i>;
attend thou therefore to <i>solution</i>, &amp; Nature will joyn together,
and this <i>Dissolution
</i>is made in <i>Mercury </i>by the help of included
<i>Luna</i>,
and
<i>Fire</i>. For <i>Luna </i>penetrates and <i>Albifies</i>, and the
fire mortifies and Triturates; but the Water includes both these Virtues,
according to the saying of the <i>Philosophers, ‘The Fire which I will
shew thee is water’</i>. And another, ‘<i>Unless Bodies be subtilized by
Fire and water, nothing is done in the Magistery’</i>. O Blessed <i>Mercury
</i>of
ours, which frees us from those many Labours which <i>Sophisters
</i>endure!
For they make many Operations with their hands, and profit nothing, because
they know not the true Course of <i>Nature</i>. But we do nothing, but
leave all things to be done by our <i>Mercury</i>, which proceeds in a
better <i>Method</i>, according to its Natural Instinct, then any man could
invent: for he is constrained by the necessity of his End, wherefore he
never misses the right way if he be not hindered.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are some <i>Sophistical </i>Operators,
who take <i>Gold </i>and put it to <i>Mercury</i>, then hut them in a Glass
and set them over the <i>Fire</i>, expecting some notable thing from thence:
But since they cast fat and good <i>Seed </i>into barren <i>Land</i>, they
are deceived, for they find not the <i>Harvest they expected</i>, because,
as is abovesaid, and shall be further said more plainly, <i>Gold </i>is
not the matter of our Stone in its whole Essence, nor yet <i>Mercury</i>,
wherefore the bare mixture of these cannot <i>Generate our Stone</i>, for
<i>Gold</i>,
in the Work, is a <i>Male </i>to the Work of <i>Generation</i>, in whose
most secret <i>Reins </i>the <i>Seed </i>lies hid, which if it once send
fort, being received in a due <i>Matrix </i>and conjoined with the passive
<i>female
Seed</i>, ‘tis Cherished with a due Heat, and <i>Cibated
</i>with a proper
Aliment, then truly we shall have from <i>Gold </i>abundantly to perform
our Work. So neither a man, as he is a man, can neither be called the Father,
nor the matter of the <i>Embrio</i>: but as he has in him such a matter,
from which by the Conjunction of a <i>Dissimilar spermatick matter</i>,
in the same kind, by an apt Disposition the <i>Infant </i>is formed: In
like manner we must understand of <i>Gold</i>. For <i>Gold </i>is the most
perfect of all <i>Metals</i>, and the Father of our <i>Stone</i>, yet it
is not the <i>matter </i>thereof for the <i>Sperm </i>which <i>Gold </i>sends
forth if it be handled by Art, will be the <i>masculine matter </i>of our
<i>Stone</i>,
and is nothing else then a most digested <i>Virtue </i>of
<i>Gold</i>,
which is Extracted from it by <i>sagacious Art</i>, and then is called
our <i>Living Gold</i>, and not <i>vulgar</i>, which is dead: So also in
the Procreation of man, a man may be said to be Dead, (Respect being had
to the <i>Act of Generation</i>) until he pours out the due matter which
he hath in himself into a fit Place, just so ‘tis in our Art; therefore
our <i>Gold </i>is not <i>vulgar Gold</i>, for they differ as a Father
differs from his <i>Sperm </i>which he hath, the firs is necessary to our
Work, and Living, the other dead and unprofitable, that is, sends forth
its <i>Seed</i>, which is the Active Virtue of our <i>Stone</i>. So therefore
go ye on with a great deal of <i>Caution</i>, take this <i>Body </i>which
I have Demonstrated, and sweetly Extract the Seed from it, then (and not
till then) this <i>Gold </i>(which before was Dead, Idle and useless) being
made Living, active and fit for our Work, will supply thee with the first
matter of our <i>Stone</i>, to wit the <i>masculine</i>, and so is no longer
called <i>Gold </i>by us, but <i>Brass, Magnesia, Lead, Dung</i>, nor can
it indeed properly be called <i>Gold</i>, for <i>Gold </i>is a <i>Body
</i>but
this a <i>Chaos</i>, that is a <i>Spirit</i>, nor will it Return by any
art to its <i>Pristine Species </i>of <i>Gold</i>, because the Body is
turned into <i>Spirit</i>, from hence saith <i>Menabdes, ‘I order Posterity
to make Bodies incorporate’. Hermes </i>also says, <i>‘O Son Extract from
the Gold which is called the Radius'</i>, that is, Extract from the <i>Gold
</i>which
is called the Radius, its Seed which is called the Shadow, both because
it lies hidden and as it were in a Shade, and also because it comes out
under an obscure Shade of <i>Blackness. Aristotle </i>also saith, <i>‘The
first thing that ye ought to do is to sublime the Mercury, then cast clean
bodies into a clean Mercury’</i>. But I would have the Reader Admonished
what sort of <i>Sublimation </i>is here intended, for there are infinite
false Erroneous and <i>Sophistical Operations</i>, one true and Natural,
which notwithstanding is done by Art, I omitting all these Vulgar <i>Operations
</i>follow
the Intention of the <i>Philosophers</i>, and mean that <i>Sublimation
</i>which
they call the Preparation of the Thin Matter, by which the <i>Eclipse
</i>of
the <i>Earthy Imposition </i>is taken from <i>Luna</i>, that she may receive
Light from <i>Sol</i>, which comes to pass when the <i>Dark Sphere of Saturn
</i>which
<i>obnubilates </i>the whole <i>Horizon </i>is vanquished then
<i>Jupiter
</i>obtaining the Empire ascends into the Air with a <i>splendid Cloud</i>,
whence sincere, Beautiful and Lovely <i>Dew
</i>drops upon the
<i>Earth</i>,
which mollifies it, and raiseth great Winds in its Belly or bosom, which
brings our <i>Stone </i>upward whence ‘tis endued with Heavenly Virtue,
which falling down again to the Earth which is its Nurse, puts on a <i>Terrene
</i>and Corporeal Nature, so it receives the Force of Inferiours and Superiours.
We conclude therefore, that neither <i>Gold
</i>nor <i>Mercury</i>, can
afford us the first <i>matter
</i>of our <i>Stone</i>, until the Tincture
be <i>Extracted </i>from <i>Gold</i>, the Dissolvend, by <i>Mercury </i>the
Dissolvent, which Tincture is a Living active virtue, not Dead as <i>Gold
</i>was before its Dissolution. This is the matter of the old <i>Philosophers</i>,
which we ought to take, which as the Author of the New Light sayes, <i>‘is,
but does not appear until the Artist pleaseth, in knowing which all the
Perfection consists'</i>. Wherefore I order you who ever would be searchers
out of this Secret, that you would take that which is vile, and manifest
to the whole world, out of which, by a wonderful manner, ye shall Extract
that which is most hidden therein, that is our
<i>Menstruum</i>, and the
<i>Western Mercury </i>is our <i>Philosophical Field</i>, in which your
<i>Sol </i>shall arise and ascend; Join this with his Delectable <i>Bridegroom</i>,
and let them lye in the <i>bed of Love
</i>without stirring, until from
this hidden Nature (which is <i>Mercury
</i>regenerated by the Philosopher
there proceed a Living Virtue which may raise the Dead, then comes a Royal
Off-spring, of which <i>Sol </i>is the Father, and <i>Luna </i>the Mother;
and so you have a most true Explication of the <i>New Light</i>, you must
take (saith the <i>Author</i>) ‘<i>that which is, but is not seen till
the Artist please, and you must use this, for the true matter of the old
Philosophers’</i>, and so we have spoken truly and plainly of our <i>body</i>,
and of our
<i>water</i>; and of our
<i>Red Sulphur</i>, and white <i>Brass</i>.
We have said there ought to be added to these a <i>Furnace, Vessel </i>and
triple Fire: Note well what, and about what, I speak here, for the Furnace
is of Lute, or Brick, the Vessel Glass, and the Fire Elementary, of which
we will speak lower in the last place of this little Treatise, concerning
our Disposition, but here we speak of things Essentially and Substantially
Conducing to the work. For the <i>Furnace </i>of Brick, is not wont to
be called by us our
<i>Furnace</i>, nor Elementary <i>fire </i>ours, nor
the Glass vessel our: for these commonly are common to us and <i>Sophisters</i>,
and they will excel us often in the Curiosity of these Externals. But we
call those things ours which they Neither have nor can have, verily I say
that our <i>Fire</i>, our <i>Furnace</i>, our <i>Vessel </i>are secret,
nor obvious but to <i>Philosophers</i>, for they enter into the very Essence
of our Work, hence a certain <i>Philosopher
</i>writing of this fire, sayest,
<i>‘Behold
the fire which I will show thee is Water'</i>, also another witnesseth
thus of the Vessel, <i>‘The vessel of Philosophers is their water’</i>,
another also writes, <i>‘The Intention of all the Philosophers is this,
that all operations should be made in their humid fire, in a secret furnace
and vessel’</i>, which Testimonies plainly enough declare another Fire,
Vessel and Furnace then are commonly known. Moreover my Brother, let it
not be a cause of scruple to thee, that I have before numbered, our <i>furnace,
fire</i>, and <i>vessel </i>amongst the things essentially Constituting
our Stone, for in this I follow the Intention of all <i>Philosophers
</i>writing
in this Art. Concerning this Vessel <i>Sendivogius </i>Writing, names it
the Vessel of Nature, also the Fire of Nature. <i>Flammel, Artefius, Lully</i>,
and all the rest have kept the same Method; it is plain therefore that
they would have something hidden from the eyes of the Vulgar. But I in
good truth say, that these three are but one, for Nature is but one, the
<i>Adept </i>Sons of <i>Art
</i>do know, and will Witness this. For the
Fire is, to the Excruciating of Bodies, more then fire, therefore it is
called burning Wine and a most strong fire, hence the <i>Philosopher, ‘Burn
our Brass in most strong fire’</i>; which whilst <i>Sophisters </i>hear,
they are deceived, thinking it to be a fire of Coals or flame, which is
contrary to our fire. Concerning this <i>John Mechungus </i>speaks, <i>‘No
artificial fire can infuse so great a heat as that which comes from Heaven’</i>.

<p><b><font size=+2>The First Gate</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Concerning Philosophical Calcination.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Not Printed in the Dutch Edition.</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Calcination </i>Purgeth our <i>Stone</i>, Restores
Natural Heat, destroys nothing of the Radical <i>Humidity</i>, &amp; brings
a due Solution to the <i>Stone</i>: The Caution is, that it may be done
<i>Philosophically</i>,
not vulgarly with <i>Salts </i>or <i>Sulphur </i>variously prepared, <i>&amp;c</i>.
Whosoever therefore truly desire to Calcine, should desist from this Work
till they understand our Calcination better, for that every Calcination
destroys Bodies, destroying the Humidity of the
<i>Stone</i>; we also do
Reprobate all dry Calxes, for that we Increase the Radical <i>Humidity
</i>by
<i>Calcining</i>, but diminish none. In
<i>Calcination</i>, we joyn Nature
to its Nature, for that like loves like, if any one denies this he will
not be worthy of the Name of a <i>Philosopher</i>, nor ever will get any
benefit from our Writings, for he understands them not. Therefore apply
thou Nature to Nature, as Reason requires, seeing all things have this
from nature, that Like begets its Like, Man is begot by a Man, a Lion by
a Lion, so let everything be Calcined first in its proper nature. Learn
this and never doubt to be benefited by it. Therefore we make Calxes unctuous
both white and Red, which are not perfected but by three Degrees, they
are fluid like Wax, otherways to be rejected, nor are perfected, but in
a year, to <i>Tinge </i>without a <i>Fucus</i>. But thou must take care
in the first place Concerning the Weight, for it is possible for thee to
doubt in this: Lest therefore thou shouldst loose thy Labour, let the body
be <i>Calcined </i>with <i>Mercury</i>, made so subtile, in which there
is one part of the <i>Solar </i>quality, two of the <i>Lunar</i>, until
the whole flow together like a Liquid Wax.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards Increase the <i>Solar </i>quality in <i>Mercury</i>,
that there may be four parts of him, two <i>Lunar</i>, so that thou shalt
begin the work at the Figure of the <i>Trinity</i>. Three parts of body,
three of spirit, and to Compleat the Unity, let there be one part more
of the spiritual, then the corporeal substance. This is proved by the testimony
of <i>Raymond, ‘If any one seek the Proportion there, the Doctor hath demonstrated
to me the same. But Bacon hath taken three parts of the spirit to one of
the body’</i>, I did not sleep of many nights. But choose which way thou
wilt.
