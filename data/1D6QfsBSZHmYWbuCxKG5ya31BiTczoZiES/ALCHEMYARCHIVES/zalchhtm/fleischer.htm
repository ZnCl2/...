<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind Reader! Many years have already flown, in which
I have read not only many sincere Chemical books, but also sophistical
ones, worked through the processes of the God-forsaken deceitful arch-liars,
through which I have lost both my moderate fortune and my health. If but
a single Christian friend had only revealed to me the meanest spark of
the true being, and from thence what is absorbed by animal, vegetable,
mineral and lead, flux of the solar-rays, yea! If he had led me and directed
me to catch hold of the astral, viscous, fat water, I would be forever
obliged to that one from that hour forth: In any case, for the most part
I did nothing but wander through pretended, misleading, falsely groundlessly
prescribed processes, and having worked, unfortunately did nothing but
thresh empty straw. For nearly thirty-seven years I laboured greatly, and
in all three kingdoms there was virtually no other subject to be sought,
which had not already been found to be impotent. Now when I became disgusted
with the mess, the distilling, cohobating and coagulating, and set Chemistry
wholly to the side, God willed it that during my travels, I had opportunity
to speak with a gentleman of honor concerning the nature of things; but
now I complained to him of all my labours, and how by them I had only gained
great loss, and also allowed that I did not wish to think thereon for the
rest of my life, nor would I: For two whole days this Elias Artista carefully
gave me to understand else but comforting exhortations and then a large
body of truthful lessons, with this addition:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basil’s <i>12 Keys</i>; <i>Waterstone of the Wise</i>
(Part 2); The <i>Dicta Alani</i>; <i>Viam Vertatis (True Way)</i>; <i>Beweis
der Nature</i>; <i>Philosophisch Father</i>, Herz; <i>Die am Philosophischen
Heaven hervor brechende morgen Roth</i> (Joh, de Monte Raphaim); Sendivogium;
Riplaeum; <i>Rosarium Novum Olympicum</i>, the first book; Hermetis; and
<i>Theophasti
Olympus terrae de V. Essentz</i>; Ali Puli.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, if mindful to read the account of Helvetius’
<i>Golden
Calf</i>. Then I would find that those and other sincerely truthful adepts
advise so well what can and may issue forth from mineral, vegetables and
animals, because these things were each predestined to a certain nature,
thus all things are unable and incapable of bearing something of unlike
kind, or of forming out of something of contrary nature; alone our Water,
Sun, Moon, and Celestial Dew serves all three kingdoms as a Universal Spirit,
and therefore cannot be separated from them, I must and should catch it
in the manner to be described, and bring it to effect; also I should be
unconcerned in regard to the natural fire, because this Astral Essence
would show itself clearly to me, to which the above-listed adepts have
clearly attested in their writings; how the affair is to be arranged, he
now gave me a short summary. After this sufficient argument, I neither
could nor would doubt the truth of his teaching: I had benefited well from
all the sincere instruction, and so had been able to grasp the work; so
I know not why I had to delay the work until the fourth year; by and by
I lacked this or that, by and by my mirror was broken in pieces, by and
by I was not able to have the proper vessels. Alone in the Work I have
found that: It is neither by will nor by haste, but only by the mercy of
God, and this is true. Yet for all that, because God granted me the time
and opportunity to attend properly to the Work, I studied the writings
of the above authors with great purpose, often to the twentieth reading,
especially those who spoke clearly, and became more firmly grounded day
by day; nevertheless I had a good deal of difficulty with the appearance
of the water at the beginning, until finally I found more elucidations
here and there in the writings; the true subject I doubted even less, for
I perceived in Sendivogius’ <i>Tract de Sulphur</i>; <i>Est in aere occultus
vitae cibus, quem nos rorem de nocte, di die vero aquam rarefactuam voamus
Cujus Spiritus invisibilis coagulatus, melior est quam universa terra</i>.
They eyes of those who intelligently read through the above authors will
be opened, and seekers will attain to the true well of the sages. <i>The
Dawn Breaking Forth to Heaven</i>, likewise the book, <i>Of Heaven and
Earth</i>, and not least Doctor Helvetius’ <i>Golden Calf</i> mention sufficiently
<i>quid
sit, quando et quomodo material sit sumenda</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Schweisser, or Helvetius, when he asked the
brazier what be the subject of philosophy, and if it were costly, received
for an answer: Our Matter is a heavenly salt by means of which we (namely
the Astral Salt is first extracted out of its slimy fat water and is kept)
open (this happens in a free fire, in a crucible) the earthly body (namely
Sol or Luna) and during that time the elixir is born, and the Salt out
of which the solution is achieved, and also the mineral (namely aqua viscose)
out of which this slat is made, are neither costly. Johann de Monte Raphaim,
para. 48 says: This Universal mercury is nothing else than the Astral Salt,
which a few call Heavenly; by the ancients, however, it is called the Salt
of Metals; not only do all Metals have their beginning and growth from
this spirit, but also all animals, vegetables and insects must suffocate
and decay if they should be robbed of this solar-lunar moisture, heat,
cold, life and motion. <i>Philos. Vater Herz</i>, chap. III says: It is
a corporeal spirit of a spiritual body (that one sees glittering if one
looks into the Sun), which certainly is the saltpeter of the wise. It is
really a fat, heavy, and juicy earth, which is very useful and very precious,
hidden to the ignorant, but quite common to the knowledgeable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can catch hold of this splendid Matter everywhere,
in valleys and level fields, in mountains and caves or galleries, even
in one’s own house. It is the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth,
and the esteemed natural saltpeter of the Sages. It is in everything the
Quintessence of the viscous earth, out of which Adam was made; briefly,
our Matter is a virginal earth, on which the Sun (which is her father has
never shed its rays, and the Moon is her mother; our virginal earth is
really a nurse-mother of the gods, because from her comes forth not only
Gold and Silver, but also all other metals, minerals, vegetables, and animals,
and take life, breath and air and growth from her: Also the perfect and
abundant influence of heaven is conveyed daily through each thing; who
now wishes to gain a certain understanding and fathom all things, how,
why, and wherefore all things produce and survive, that person lacks nothing,
but all can be well brought about; a bit more should ensue in the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all things, you who are God-fearing, maintaining
Christ-like love and mercy, and not the pursuits of heathen gutter-servants,
in your hearts; so will God open your eyes, and let you attain the limits
of your desires; our spirit is quite a lovely spirit, a sweet burning fire:
It consumes nothing but it well keeps and carries all things, be they good
or evil: Ohm why do you, seeker, wish to live and act godlessly, and yet
partake of the power of this spirit, when yet this holy spark of divine
love cannot serve a malignant person; Don’t rejoice too soon, you world-sick
ones, drunkards, whores and panderers, because within these lines all has
been made clear and evident, so that you could not miss it, rather you
should, and must, be able to break off and gather the unfading&nbsp; flowers
of the Sun and the moon in your dissolute state of wantonness. God sees
your heart, mind, and thoughts and intentions; so you will find that all
your designs will be paid back to you.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To you however who are firm in your intentions, so
much is required of you; also to improve your guiltiest though against
God and all creatures: To you, say I, the Philosophical Heaven stands open,
and you shall have the knowledge of the central natural salt hidden in
all things, and be its Master; which central salt, as the body of Nature,
remains incorruptible in all eternity. Then you will have an understanding
of the central salt, body of Nature; so will you also recognize God still
better, and learn to understand and know the whole basis of Nature, also
come to know in the work, that the wind has carried your sought-for spirit
in its belly. God, you know each heart, you command all that I may do.

<p><b><i><font size=+1>Chemical Moonshine</font></i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the name of God I wish to start to teach the work
clearly; seeker, begin in God’s name to understand such as the truth. Innumerably
many charlatans have written of the primary thing that issues forth from
minerals, vegetables, and animals, the one says this, the other something
else, recommending chimney soot, dust, lampblack, spittle, sweat, and many
more such fool’s tricks as the Prima Materia of the Philosopher’s Stone:
Although each one derives from the prime mover and possesses something
therefrom, as much as is needful, their users are not artists: He is also
no artist, who is able to separate such therefrom, and employ it on his
behalf; nothing is gained if he drives out this spirit from one of the
bodies, through some kind of art or fire-power, in order to catch hold
of it and to bind it: Rather, all labour is in vain, the time and expense
are lost: What such deceivers and boasters earn is the wrath and disfavour
of God, timely death and damnation: Why? How many unlearned and ignorant
people take the declarations of these liars and boasters for truth, spend
time and money, and are mistaken, and other people, many quite horribly,
lose life and limb thereby, even lose well the everlasting. Have not the
lying writers worked the greater part of misery upon these unfortunate
ones? Oh, yea. For this reason the souls steeped in God and Christ do not
wish to be led through such diabolical and heretical writings, into the
river of temporal distress, poverty, sorrow and need, nor thereby to lose
one’s life and souls’ blessing; but much rather would like to be prepared
for the perception of God and the following of Nature: So I have made public
to the while Christian world the following honest admonitions and sincere
instructions: I hope that those who stand well with God will begin and
prosper: Those, however, who prefer the spirit of the world would only
give up in time, considering that God does not cast pearls before swine.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because now however may hundred thousand searchers
have worked according to their method, and their method has set them in
poverty; likewise the same has unfortunately happened to me; Thus the noble
Chymistry has fallen into disuse and under suspicion by most people, and
also many take their example from these others and wish to seek no further.
Why? Because everything that is undertaken in the above three kingdoms
causes loss and all manner of useless and impossible things. Thus those
do not act correctly, who give up after a time, because they do not have
knowledge of the true Being, so that they also dissuade others from it;
those, however, who have sufficient information and knowledge of the ascension
of the spirit of life, can begin and go forth the more courageously, and
can be assured of a blessed outcome. For it is an easy thing to catch and
dry up naturally the being of being, the essence and life of everything,
the spirit of the world, Microcosmal Mercury, revered by philosophy, Living
Spirit, unripe electrum of minerals, and to make therefrom the central
salt of philosophers and of metals.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who however would understand my and others’ writing
with crooked eyes, in quite another sense, these I know myself not to advise;
moreover I believe, that they would easily cause themselves the greatest
pains, vexation, and loss of time and strength.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although in the preceding all has been shown more
than clearly, I desire that the seeker be deficient in nothing, and to
keep my promise, guide the way with some passages from the above-mentioned
authors; the true subject is so very easy to explain without disguise,
and also what the natural preparation be: I don’t want to start any boasting,
but candidly show and make clear to all the sorrowful and hopeless ones
the singular consolation and illumination. In Chapter 2 of <i>Waterstone
of the Wise</i>, the material is described thus: It is the same thing that
in the beginning was produced by three together, but is only one thing,
likewise be engendered and made out of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Also
it is found everywhere in ones and twos, they name is Magnesia Catholicam,
Sperm of the World, the Seed of the whole world, out of which all things
have their origin; likewise it be of a singularly wondrous birth and form,
has an unknowable and unfathomable character and nature, thus neither hot
nor dry, like the fire, nor cold and moist like the water, nor cold and
dry, like the earth, but a perfect proportion of all elements; it be also
of an indestructible body, that may be touched by no elements, which reconciles
all of its attributes as an indestructible Quintessence in everything,
even as the heavens over the 4 elements and 4 qualities; likewise it be
in outward bodily appearance, figure, shape and form, a stone and yet no
stone, rather it compares more to a kind of gum or water; they call it
also a water of the great sea, a water of life, yea the purest and most
blessed water, it is however no water of the clouds or of a common spring-fount,
but rather a thick, sticky and salty one, also after sundry examinations,
a dry one, that does not wet the hands, or a dirty water that springs from
the salty fatness of the earth. Likewise a twofold Mercurium and Azoth,
which is fed and nourished by the lowest and highest, vapours of the celestial
and terrestrial spheres, mist and sweat, which also burns in no fire, because
it itself has in it a spark of universal fire of the Light of Nature; in
addition a celestial spirit that dissolves all things, with which it was
blessed and animated by God from the beginning, which Avicenna calls the
Soul of the World, and of which he says: Even as the soul exists and moves
and exists in all elemental creatures, it is an inseparable union of body
and soul, the purest and noblest essence, in which all secrets are concealed,
full of wondrous power and virtue; it possesses also a divine strength,
power and&nbsp; virtue, it is that Spirit of the Lord, that fills up the
fissures of the earth, and moved upon the face of the waters in the Beginning;
it is also called the spirit of truth, hidden to the world, and without
the call of the Holy Ghost, or instruction from those that know it, may
be
neither grasped nor obtained (attained); that is in everything, in every
realm according to its degree, but which is only in certain bodies found
in perfection.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, such a spiritual substance, that is neither
celestial nor infernal, but rather a pleasant clear pure substance, the
fixed middle between the lowest and the highest, also the most elect, and
most precious under the heavens: It will not be known by those who have
no understanding of it, or first begin with consideration of value, for
is the meanest of all, and most unesteemed, yea, as a rejected thing; which
however is sought by many, but found by few, may be found everywhere, collected
and taken, seen by everyone, but its separation known by few. Now it is
certainly true, what Salomon Trismosin says: No perfect tincture comes
forth except from a true and perfect root, for the beginning of the work
is our solution, noting is brought about in the work unless the semen of
man conjoins with the femininity of woman. Who is desirous to attain to
the treasure of the red lion, that one must be able to draw the Sun out
of the mountains, quench the same with its heat with the lion’s blood,
thus will the hidden spirit increase in strength; who will now attract
to himself the little fish, Echeneis or Remora Echeneis, remora ‘sucking
fish’ of Pliny, as <i>Philosophisch Vaterherz</i> says, that one will find,
that it turns in a natural manner into a water, and this into earth, which,
if properly prepared through the artful secret of the sages, has the strength
to dissolve all fixed bodies; to make the fixed volatile, and to purify
all diseased bodies: In the 3rd Chapter he says: I say to you once more,
that our Matter is nothing else than the Earth, but not that on which we
walk, but that which hovers over our heads; the sages call it their Virgin
Earth: It is the element which gives the Earth its origin; briefly to tell:
It is the noble earth of the earth of the sages; whose Father is the Sun,
and Mother the Moon: It is the fatness of the mineral earth, or noble spiritual
and corporeal essence, out of which is made the Mercury of the Sages, the
precious salt of nature: it is the true and common Mercury of the Sages,
not however of the common folk, namely quicksilver.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can seek and take this precious Matter in the
caves, on the plains and in the Mountains, one finds it in all the paces
of the inhabited Earth, but one should grasp and take it, before the Sun
has had sight of it; Theophrastus says: Who takes not the Moon down from
heaven, to make water, and subsequently is able to bring the water into
an earth, will never find the correct Matter of the Philosopher’s Stone.
In the following passage Hermes testifies plainly and clearly:
<p><i>In superiori sphaera</i>
<br><i>Est in medio frontis vena</i>
<br><i>Quae est regula</i>
<br><i>Philosophorum prima.</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the origin and spring of the Quintessence, called:
Olympus of Earth, Theophrastus speaks plainly, which is the true Matter,
the tingeing key, the clear salt, soul, spirit, body, water and fire.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To advise first how, one finds metals and minerals
in no other place but only in the mountains, and in the ground, where the
mineral water is found admixed, the root which is found in fire and water
together with the Philosophical matter, and it continues to grow or lie
quietly, seeking is own proper level. This is the True Materia, that is
not wet, that is however an element and a water, and is only one thing,
which may not be separated from the earth, for it is from the Earth, the
Earth is the nourishment of such material; it is full of spiritual life;
celestial, terrestrial, magnetic, it is refreshed by the pure celestial
dew, the Earth harbors it and is its mother; it existed from the beginning
of the world, this Spirit which attracts air, fire, and water and encloses
all in one: The heavens are adorned with many stars, the Sun and Moon:
This Materia cannot become fruitful without the heavens’ cooperative help.
Also no single thing could live and endure, if it did not unceasingly receive
this celestial, Astral, material, cooperative power, this spirit or salt:
All life comes down from above, each life as its separate defect in the
root of its Spheres, its own salt-spirit, all metals, vegetables and animals
meet in the center in agreement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because then all grace, blessings, and gifts come
down from above, all things long for the life-spirit, at first for the
water, the water for the earth and for the spirit, that they may both accomplish
their effect, but all lay claim to the heavens. Through fire, air, water
and spirit are all things composed, cultivated in an orderly fashion and
made fruitful; out of the same Massa goes forth our soul-sap upon men,
to whom it is revealed. And upon whom the guiding star falls that one will
obtain this treasure and bring forth its efficacious power. We know, that
the water dwells within the earth, the water must also become the earth,
and it ascends out of our Materia and becomes a spiritual subtle creature.
Its extract and tincture, is a salty essence, an incombustible, abiding
fiery oil, the key that unlocks all, and transmutes into its own likeness.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus water and earth must dwell continuously mixed
together, terrestrial and celestial intermingled, keeping company together
with that which must become water and spirit; this is now plain, that our
Materia is a pure water, a spirit, a celestial fire, a pure spiritual extracted
salt: It is born of the sun, created beautifully pure and clear, containing
the indwelling fire, that comes forth out of the Divine essence, that externally
is the greatest poison, though internally the highest good and medicine:
Firstly, you must well purify our Materia, through water, these two, as
the earth and spirit mix well with the seeds, make one&nbsp; (thing) to
bring forth the noble salt-spirit, because without such Magisterium salis
we accomplish nothing, also I would further advise you, that everything
that has been joined together once in the beginning, should remain together,
and henceforth no longer be separable: Because that which is below must
become like that which is above, both come into One, and remain, in order
to attain perfection; as it became the earth, so must it again become what
it was in the beginning, namely water and spirit, which must become locked
into one; otherwise it does not take effect: In another place says Theophrastus:
It is a fiery living water, the Philosophie viscose, that climbs the mountains
and falls down into deep valleys, seek its fountainhead, thus you have
the power of to tinge, to work great wonders, in medicines and in the metals:
Therein is made clear, that it is the internal great power of the Sun alone,
whose fire is the single celestial fire, that has the power to tinge, to
work wonders, in medicines and in the metals: Therein is made clear, that
it is the internal great power of the Sun alone, whose fire is the single
celestial fire, that has the power and might to work great miracles.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is taught by the sincere philosophers, that
a divine fire is enclosed in the Solar Archaeus, which is only enticed
forth by means of the true philosophical key, it is a water and a fiery
beam, this works at and resolves all that is hidden, without force and
labour; it conveys everything within itself, it is the beginning and the
end, a celestial dew, the united Matrix, the quickening growing power,
that consumes soul, spirit and body and is regenerated again: Without this
sap and rays of the sun, gold’s inhabitant can neither be seen nor captured.
It is only a singular essence, a single root, a single universal, that
can mingle with all things, and attract to itself that which is of value:
If all things did not partake of this, they would be in a state of nothingness
(nihilium); Italaii says figuratively: The roots of its Minera be in the
air, and the earth in the height, and when it is pulled up by its root,
so is heard a frightful sound, and a great fear follows afterward.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here learn to understand, that when the rays of the
Sun reach the volatile damp earth, salt or saltpeter, thence arise lightning
and thunder. Therefore one must catch the atoms soon, ere they vanish.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Libro Saturni</i>, is said: Our Stone is known
to all, it is thrown upon the open path, everyone can have it who knows
how to capture it. Mundus in <i>Turba</i>: You should trouble yourselves
neither with the putting together of many things, nor with those things
which the Philosophers have set in their books; for the secret of the truth
is a single nature, and that has hidden it in its belly, invisibly, and
is known only by the sages: Alphidius, in <i>Turba</i>: It is a stone,
a nature, a joining, a vessel for the white and red, to make it straight.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosarius</i> says: It is only a stone, namely
our Philosophical Solar Water, our one true way, a medicine which adds
nothing externally, but nonetheless something is accomplished thereby,
for this one removes the superfluities in the preparation; for if something
external were to be effected, the work would be immediately disturbed,
and nothing that is sought would be obtained therefrom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arilatus says: Who would follow after the truth should
take the sun’s heat, and the froth of the moon. Hamis in <i>Turba</i>:
If you would take the Sulphur and Argent Vive, each in its natural way,
so you must alloy these two, for the right measure and proportion is totally
unknown to human understanding, and next cook these substances to a thick
jelly. Johann de Monte Raphaim, 28 says: The Tincture has been universal
from the beginning, as it still moved upon the waters, but afterwards became
specified, and from thence to be found in all things of the four Nature-kingdoms,
as Astral, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral, but in particular it is to be
found in the Astral kingdom, the best in the sun. 34 says a wise man, such
a water is to be drawn out of the rays of the Sun and the Moon, in a wonderful
manner, by a skillful Master of Art: This rarified Water is a Material
compared to the Light, a Forma compared to the Created or Elemental, but
it is itself an Astral Substance, and a Tincture of all natural things.
How now to make manifest this Water as a celestial Materia and terrestrial
Forma, which it was formerly, that stands once again in great secret: One
perceives something therefrom, when one handles that Body such that it
neither becomes so heavy, nor remains as it was previously; this must be
considered well.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that no one may complain that I have not
fulfilled my promise, I want to point out some more sincere teachings.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of Nature</i> says: GOD Created mankind
in his image, but it deviates so far from Nature, that for that reason
Nature addresses the fanciful worker thus: You have neither Art nor the
correct Materia, neither theory nor knowledge nor my acknowledgement, you
churlish asses break glasses, char coals so that the fumes make you lightheaded,
you cook alum, salt, auripigment, chimney soot, boil black barren metals,
attempt to separate and distill great and small, and require various vessels
and furnaces. I am ashamed of your folly, for you sicken me with your brimstone
smoke; you presume through your strongly burning fire to fix the Argent
vive, but that is only the ordinary volatile, and not the same thing out
of which I make a metal; if you don’t go another way, you perform nothing,
because you do don’t understand my Art: It is better for you to stay your
actions, than for you to perform so much daubing through dissolution, distillation,
separation, cohobation, alembics, curcurbits, and pelicans: You will never
make Argent vive coagulate thus: You need for your vivification to reverberate,
fire, and that so hot, that everything flows; but in the end you spoil
it, and others with you, if you don’t enter into my smithy in which I forge
metals without ceasing within the earth: For in there will you seek the
Matter with which I work, and the method of my work.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think not that I will reveal you my secrets, if you
do not seek the growing seed of metals, animals and vegetables: These which
are entirely within my Power, one concerning so much the generation, the
other so much the nutrition.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Metals have only the Spirit, Vegetables the Life,
the Animals sensibility, which is more than growth. I make Metals, Stones
and Atraments, out of the Elements, which I bring into a Mixture and first
Composition, in the Belly of the Earth; you need not seek for such elsewhere.
The vegetables maintain their seeds, and Forms, through the same. In the
same way also the Animals bear their likeness. Each performs its proper
office, without falsehood.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You Wicked Man, and would be Wise Worker! You differ
from me more than all other creatures do: The Metals have no life, yet
still some nourishment to grow, to become green, or to increase; they have
no breeding seeds, therefore they also do not procreate their kind they
are fashioned in the beginning out of the substance of the 4 Elements,
from these I produce them. They and the stones have nothing more than the
Spirit, all stones are brittle, all metals malleable, after their fusion
partly fixed, and fit for the hammer. Gold and Silver, however, receive
great perfection through artful purifications, the others however are so
much the impurer; For their Argentum Vivum is too raw, their earthly Sulphur
is too combustible; because the same material has no good Form, so the
same Metal also cannot be purified; I ordain everything thus, that each
brings forth its form, after the Materia is pure.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like to know, how I obtain the Materia
from each thing, so I say to you, that I first open the Chamber of my high
subtle secrets, and seek the next Materiam, as to make a Mineral: This
I take out of the Box of my four Elements, and such is a beginning seed,
which has in itself an essential Form, Composed in simplicity, prepared
and well ordained, to transmute the four into One; Truly Fire, Water, Air,
and Earth; so it is a Universal Birth, or ordinary Catholic thing. Then
I give it my metallic art through may Goodness and art, therefrom Metals
become pure, and impure, hard and soft; I draw such Matter out of the elements,
and carry it through length of time from the first to the next proper Material,
from which I make my Minerals: After it goes forth into Sulphur and mercury,
which runs into metal; not however such Mercury as you see as the Vulgar
Mercury; through its quality, it is able to transmute the one into the
other by its own proper nature (the vulgar into the Philosophic Mercury):
Each Materia goes through the putrefaction and strong Corruption, by means
of Privation from its first Form, and puts on a new one, through natural
warmth, which the Material has in itself, and is awakened by the heavens;
with gentle Fire, so I know to make, I give finally a Form, which the Materia
receives gladly, and puts on.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this fashion (Privation, Form and material) are
my Materia received from the above Principal and Beginnings.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord, the Creator has commanded me, that I (as
his hand-servant) transmute the four Elements from the Universal Materia,
through my operation and administration, and bring all mineral forms under
a common or Universal form: Likewise I carry through my natural Art the
Sun in 24 hours around the circumference of the earth, which never ceases
to stir a warmth, through its motion in every element; similarly also the
8 spheres, and the 7 Planets; and their Father the Primum Mobile, with
whom all the other spheres travel about.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now further, the common gold and silver is such a
perfect Metal, and all imperfect Metals come forth from the mercury, therefore
all Philosophers call it a Mother of the Metals, and it follows therefrom,
a twofold metallic substance be in it: Firstly, the substance which enters
Luna, and also the Sun, is such a Metal to which others are not similar
from this Double Substance (Rebis) is formed the Philosophical mercury,
which spiritual essence is in its Body; so soon as the nature of this Mercury
is formed from the double Spirit, so he desired to form it perfectly, and
make it corporeal, which cannot occur without it. When now this double
Spirit rouses, says Flamel, and the double spermatic Seed awakens, so they
long to receive their particular Body; then their Mother the Mercury must
die; vainglorious alchemists say indeed, that one must and should make
perfect and imperfect bodies into a flowing Mercury; that this then be
the true Subject of Philosophy: But this is an empty fraud; who however
joins together the Sun and Moon through the true Mercury, so this one makes
all imperfect Metals perfect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philosophers have a Garden, wherein the Sun is
without ceasing, morning an evening, Day and Night always, together with
a sweet Dew, by which it is sprinkled, and deeds the trees and Fruits that
have been planted therein; which receive their proper nourishment from
pleasant pastures, this happens from day to day; they become strong and
mighty, without ceasing at the least in one year, as they otherwise would
not have done in 1000 years, in the place where they formerly stood, where
they suffered the cold.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Via Veritatus</i> tells: These are the corporeal
Matter, which is evident to us as Fire and Water: These same corporeal
Elements are nothing else, but an assistance to the essence of the Elements,
by which they may be brought naturally to their highest Degree: For they
have called the elemental Fire our Sun, and the Liquid our moon, wherewith
the Alchemists and Sophists may deceive, because they never think about
the truth of the Matter, but always suppose it must be drawn out of the
bodies: But the Sages have therefore named it Corpora, because our Water,
evident, palpable, and tangible, and the Elemental Water and Fire is spiritual
and invisible. They teach and show the true Materiam and Substance, but
on the contrary there is not more than one true Subject and a single Method
of Procedure.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I should think, that enough has been spoken of
the true and most suitable matter, I would from thence at least speak of
the Preparation, or natural Working, so then of its ferment, and Use, with
which everyone can be satisfied.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have the matter, you know; but you don’t know
its virtue; And if you already knew its virtue, that doesn’t help you,
if you don’t also know its effect and Operation: One cannot attain its
effect without God’s Inspiration, or a true Adept’s direction and instruction.
Rhodianus says: In this Work of the Alchymy many go astray, few attain
to Perfection. Hermes, in ‘Turba’ indicates its subject: The Subtle airy
Dampness, with a watery, and the Watery with an earthy dryness, are thus
joined and put together, that they may scarcely r never be parted from
one another, and then only with the most subtle understanding of the Artist:
He is Blessed! Who possesses such understanding, such to perform.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For without this separation all Alchemists have endeavored
fruitlessly, because in this separation or cooking is found such a great
and heavy difficulty, and the ignorant one supposes he must bring forth
Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, separate, purify, and put together again, but
that isn’t it, and still fewer should be: Therefore no one or hardly anyone,
of all the Philosophers in the world, can bring it to fruit; therefore
no one should boast that he Knows the Stone, that he knows how to separate
the abovementioned Humidity and dampness in the Stone, and to separate,
that is, to put asunder the remainder, and to make it out of Water, Earth,
and Salt.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who now knows how to make this separation, and can
naturally unite the purer parts, namely the Airy, Spiritual, and most Subtle,
and make out of the same a Medicine: He will be a Seeker of this precious
perfection.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morienus teaches the Alchemist, when he says: This
is this thing’s root, that who wishes to learn this same, he first must
receive his instruction from a master teacher, since the master teacher
must make some Experiments for him: For there are many hindrances in this
Art:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The Matter should be gathered at the right Time,
and scarcely when the ran goes out to pasture: For although such can be
gathered at all times, this however is not so powerful or well to have
at all times.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. This must be well preserved, until Putrefaction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. After this it must be prepared to a natural, and
not a Sophistical essence, as the Alchemist knows to perform without hands,
or artificial ovens, horsedung, charcoal, or lamp-fire.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The vessel should be thick, firm, well-joined,
and have no cracks.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The Seal of Hermes, with which Nature could and
may perform its function from the beginning until the End, is to be made
loosely, if not, then so the Radicale Humidum should not have enough space
and air to be able to throw of the Superfluous and Heterogeneous things;
everything should stand still, and putrefy sooner, and is condensed and
dried in itself. Each one has their own just and firm Idea, how such could,
should, and maybe occur.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermes, Theophrastus, Rosarius and yet others say:
Although our Stone holds its Tincture naturally within itself, since it
is perfectly created in the body of the magnesia (lode-stone), that is,
of the earth; but however it has not the Motive or motion within itself,
that a perfect Elixir comes out of it, unless it would be prepared and
moved through Art and Effect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From thence says a Philosophers, Son: Pull its shadow
from out of the whip-marks. For that reason such an effort is necessary
to us, how you look at a child, which arrives at its creation, is born
perfectly, but however is imperfect; what arrives to the effect, is above
all to be nurtured: Therefore through the Art this should be accomplished,
what has been omitted or forsaken by Nature, and in the Stone the tincture
is to be bettered, more than I is in its nature: From thence says Boriellus:
Nothing is made out of the Elements, without a Regiment, prepared with
highest purpose: Some think it well done, if they inclose the Materia in
a vessel, and hang it in the air in the shade, where there is no wind,
or bury it in the earth, with attention to certain months, days and hours,
and the advantageous course of the planets and Stars; that thus Nature
performs all the rest: And this the Regimen Lapidus, be nothing else than
an ordering of advantageous place and time: Which lets itself be seen if
they had done thus; because they see, that the Metals itself in the earth.
As also the Stones, Minerals and grown things are to be brought to their
consummation through heat and virtue that is caused by the celestial bodies:
The more, <i>Rosarius</i> says: You have enough, if you have nourished
the material correctly externally. For it can produce sufficient changes
in itself toward perfection: For it has the motion sleeping in itself,
after its own measure, and a better and more certain disposition, than
can be conceived by a man, in the creation and generation of a thing. Therefore
must such a preparation be in the Magistery of Philosophy. For as Nature
is not hindered through the contrary: Thus it cannot exceed is similar
motion before it has the time to become pregnant, to bear, to nourish,
and to operate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this is concluded, that the Philosophers would
have and say, the Cooking of the Stone must occur by the warmth of the
Sun.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Year must be divided into 4 Times, and command
the Stone to rule after the changings, says Zenon, in <i>Turba</i>: The
Year is divided into 4 divisions. First is the winter, cold and moist.
2nd. The Spring, warm and moist. 3rd. The Summer, warm and dry. 4th. The
Autumn, cold and dry. In this way one should govern the two natures. From
thence says Morienus: Our whole Magisterium is nothing else than a drawing
of the water out of the Earth, and that one pours the same over the Earth,
or a such operation.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mundus</i> says: These two, namely man and Wife,
father and mother, the rays of the sun and moon made finely whitish in
the vessel, and beseech Almighty God Basely, that you see this Stone mixed;
then cook it, draw the Soul out of it by degrees, see it the Stone has
become black; if it is thus, so has it been done correctly, if not, so
govern it with the Judicious Juice, so long until it is covered with the
greatest blackness; this is the whole secret.
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturea</i>: After the Putrefaction occurs the
Generation, through the internal incombustible warmth, therewith to heat
up the cold of the Argent vive, which suffers so much, that it becomes
one with its Sulphur. This is held within a vessel, Fire, Air, and Water:
I take these in the earthly vessel and let them remain, in a single oven,
then I cook, dissolve and sublimate them, without hammer, tongs or Coal,
fumes, fire, and waterbath, and without Sophistical Ovens: For I have my
heavenly Fire, which awakens the elemental, according as the Matter desires
a suitable Form.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I draw my Argent vive out of the 4 Elements,
and its Matter that attracts its Sulphur at once, which it heats and attracts:
Then the cold becomes warm, and the dry moist. Mark, however, that the
moist is not without its dryness, and the dry is not without its moistness,
for one is retained by the other in its first Essence; which is the Essential
Elementary, the Spirit and the fifth Essence from which our child takes
its birth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire bears and nourished it in the air, first
of all however it putrefies in the Virgin Earth: Afterward the water comes
forth, so we must seek that which is the first Matter, from which I begin
Minerals.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A contrary thing opposes the other contrary with
violence, and hardens itself in such a manner, that it is not taken away
by the Operation. Then is the passive thing transmuted, and its Form laid
bare, through desire for the Matter, which perpetually puts on a new Form.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I Govern the Primum Mobile through my wisdom, my
hands are the 8 Spheres, as my Father has ordained, my hammers are the
7 Planets, with which I forge such beautiful things: The Matter, from which
I make my Work, <i>viz</i>. Stones, metals, Trees, herbs, rational and
irrational animals, and in general all things which the heavens enclose,
I take alone from the 4 Elements: The Chaos or Hyle is the first Matter:
This is the Mistress who gladdens the King, Queen, and all the courtiers:
The knight is ever ready in its place, and the chamber-maid seed to her
charges. The more magnificent the Form is, the magnificently I show myself
therein: And I know, that I have the Power to give the essence to all Essences;
to keep them continually, and to awaken the Form in the Materia.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark the three things, into which God in the beginning
divided the first matter; from the first and purest part, he fashioned
Cherubim and Seraphim, and every angel, from the second not so pure parts,
he fashioned the heavens and their issues, from the thirds and impure part
the Elements with their properties; Firstly, the Fire, which precedes the
others in virtue, this he put into the heights under the moon; it has no
Corruption in itself, but rather it has the pure part of the Quintessence:
After this he made the subtle Air, and [puts into it part of the Quintessence
also, but not so much as into the Fire: After this followed the visible
Element of Water, which has as much of the Fifth Essence, as it has occasion
for, after the water finally the Earth: However, such all and the whole
of Nature, of which I am the first creature: He created in an instant:
The Earth he made thick and opaque, but fruitful; this holds in itself
the Least of the Fifth essence.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning also the elements stood only plainly
and simply in their Spheres, thus the Air is Moist, the Fire helps it:
The Water is cold, and moist, which Moistness is taken from the Air: The
Earth is dry, and cold, and takes the coldness from the water, but on account
of its great dryness it approaches Fire. The fire is the most important
Element, and Gives Life, and through its warmth it causes growth; Now should
I also tell you, that there is no Element that does not work in the others,
thus, that one working, the tolerating: The Fire works in the Air, the
Air in the Water, the Water works in the Air and Earth, if the Fire causes
the workings. The Earth is a mother and Nourisher of all things, and everything
which may go under the heavens in the corruption, and gives them the warmth
without ceasing in her belly, it nourishes them, after the birth; so much
power has God given me, that I bring the Four Elements back again into
the Fifth Essence, which one then calls the first Matter, which is mixed
in each one of the Elements: Alone in me is the Power to transmute the
Elements in their Forms; who holds otherwise is mistaken; I am it, that
formed the Creatures, and gives them Nature, attribute and Matter: The
secret has been given to me alone, and to no other Man.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Son, I would tell you yet a true word, namely
that the whole Work is made by a single, ordinary, common, united with
itself Matter, in a single well-sealed vessel, and a single oven; it has
everything in it, which is necessary for perfection, and is finished by
a single Regimen of the Fire.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who now knows the correct Matter, prepares the same
also in a well-sealed vessel, and puts everything properly into its Oven,
that one need no longer delay the Work.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forsake all Sophistic Processes, let be their various
ovens and vessels; let go their horse-dung, their wood and Coal Fire, such
is totally unnecessary; let stand the Metals and others, rather transmute
the Elements into an unchangeable form, which is of the magnificent Philosophical
Matter, which the ignorant throw away; it is like the substance of Gold,
but unlike the Essence: Invert the Elements, so you will find what you
seek: I think that you should Sublimate the fixed, and fix the Sublimate.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So take now Argentum Vivum, which is mixed with its
living Sulphur, do everything in a single well-sealed vessel, in a single
oven, which is filled to the 3rd part, set it over the Fire of the Philosophers,
beware, that it does not become smoky. Do it thus, and trust me, forsake
for that reason My Son all other Species, and take not the Matter, from
which the Minerals begin, more I will not say to you, but I swear to you
truthfully, that you must follow me and Nature:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you put the eggs under the hen to be hatched,
so it is not necessary that one grows the same; thus you should also not
grow you matter or Mercury, but rather take it, and put with its likeness,
which is the Fire, in the Ashes, which is the Straw, in a single Glass,
which is the Nest, without other things, in a proper oven, which is the
House; so that therefrom, a young Bird, which will heal all illnesses,
through its blood, and satisfy you for food from its Flesh, from its feathers
will it clothe you, and protect you from the cold.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reply of the Alchemist: Thus have Thou Nature, led
me onto the True Path; I thank Thee for that. I know that all My Works
are fit for nothing, metallic, mineral, vegetable, animal, and other things,
many ovens, Aqua Fort, soot, ordinary dissolutions, distillations, horse
dung and Coal Fire, serve nothing with each other; Thy Books yea will I
read diligently, and follow Thine example, for that is the surest Way,
if I follow Thee. For the Art comes forth from Thee, however, I will not
spend time uselessly, so I would rather begin the Work today than tomorrow,
and take it under my hands.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to strive after the Matter, which will give
me the beautiful Argentum Viva, by means of thine effective division; such
would I do, in a well-sealed clean vessel, and put under an oven, which
has been surrounded by A Wall: Then thou Nature will know to do the Work
further, as it ought: I give honest thanks therefore to Thee, fo all Arts,
that thou hast given me, and to make thine Inheritance such a high good.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will follow thy Teachings, that I may acquire this
Noble Tincture from the Elements, by means of divine assistance, and thy
Help.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 2 of the <i>Waterstone of the Wise</i>. Therefore,
if you meditate with yourself in seriousness in your Oratory, and recognize
the matter also have it at hand, so may you then apply yourself in the
Laboratory and bring it under your hand with proper Work, and make a start.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, you must take the same oft-mentioned Matter,
or Primum Ens, which the Philosophers also call the highest Good of nature;
dissolve before all things, and dissolve and purify it from all its Aquosity,
and Earthiness, because in the beginning it appears to be an earthly feculent
body, a sharp, viscous, slimy, and cloudy-watered thing, also take away
from it its dark and thick-clouded treasure, with which it is obscured,
thereafter such through further Sublimations, its heat and internal Soul
which is hidden in it; divide it and separate it out, that it may be brought
into a lovely essence: his happens however, through the great catholic
sea-water, which through its swift, even flying ebb and flood, waters the
whole circumference of the earth, and makes fruitful, and therefore is
so beautiful, sweet, clear, bright, and shining, that it is to be looked
upon with admiration. Far higher and more beautiful than gold or silver,
or a carbuncle, or diamonds luster; which blessed water also holds together
in its aforesaid Matter, namely, The Philosophical Salt of the Wise.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you now preserve this, it is a good tasting, good
smelling salt, subtle, airy sort, that if it should stand in the air, would
disappear, unless it is fixed of itself. So you should take the Waters
and divide into 2 parts, out of the 2nd part, divide into 3 parts, and
carefully preserve them. Coagulate till dry, the first part (or half);
when this occurs, imbibe the reserved 1st third part, and coagulate it,
till it is again dry; the 2nd 3rd part is also imbibed and coagulated till
dry as afore; divide the last remaining 3 rd portion into 7 equal parts,
and soak your earth or salt as often as it becomes dry, until the last
7th imbibition and soaking, if it flows on a red-hot piece of metal without
smoke, and penetrates, it is good; if not, you must imbibe it with fresh
milk so long, until it is fixed and penetrates as oil into leather into
the metal; as often as you imbibe your slat, put the glass into the oven,
and give it a graduated Fire, that is gentle, continual, airy, moist, whose
warmth penetrates like a hen over her eggs. The Philosophical Fire (Fire
of the Wise) is not metallic or elemental, but only an essential Fire;
it can also be well named Divine. The Philosophical Fire is also called
Aqua Mercurii, and in truth, it is the same Fire, which the Israelites
used for their burnt offering, as it stands to be read in the 1st Chapter
of the other Book of the Maccabees; of colours and other things, it is
better to keep silent than to speak, since this only causes difficulty
and error, but in the Practice it is not so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Salt of the Wise, or Philosophers’ Stone
has gone through its 7 reddenings, and has been fixed, this can be fermented
with 3 parts Sol purified by Luna, in a strong crucible in a free fire,
for 3 or 4 days in flux, so will the metal not only appear broken, through
the acceptance of the Tincture in either Sol or Luna, and whose virtues
are multiplied in the body of either Sol or Luna, to transmute other imperfect
metals into Sol or Luna, as according whether Sol or Luna was multiplied.
It is first tinged, and through&nbsp; and through itself to tinge others.
Thus here the saying applies: ‘Nothing tinges unless it first be tinged’.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time in which the Stone can be finished, no one
can determine, the cautious and mindful know how to perform this work.
For truly very much is laid thereon, to make the Sal Philosophorum naturally,
and to him through strong and great fire his tingeing and growing art is
kept up and not chased away.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would gather this thing together briefly, write
clearly, and repeat, who has ears to hear, who has eyes to see: I cannot
possibly tend to each and every one; although I would be pleased to know
the esteemed and honest-hearted Men, near and far, and I would gladly oblige
his questions; but I alone cannot know each one’s mind and intention, so
I must, against my will remain Silent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It serves everyone to know, that presently I live
quite alone with no companions. And since the good Friend is seen no more,
I stand with no single true possessor in acquaintance: Although some are
certainly found in the Netherlands: But I should be so happy, to be able
to enjoy the acquaintance or friendship of one and the other, and would
heartily rejoice thereof.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet my intent is constantly and continually to serve
God and my Neighbor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beloved reader! God knows that to serve everyone,
I would gladly do so, full of good will, if only I had the spiritual gift
of God, to be able to examine and observe each one’s heart, mind and inclination;
whether being worthy or not. For this reason I have written this little
treatise, as a good friend, at the bidding from Above, and caused it to
be published. Perhaps some God-given Man will find what he seeks, and what
he otherwise may wish for.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak with brief words, our beginning Subject
is neither Bodily nor animal, vegetable, nor mineral, or anything else
that can or may come forth from these, but, rather in truth, a pure Astral
Essence. For all three Nature-Kingdoms are yea n each, and although each
does have as much as it needs of the Universal Spirit; though it is still
not capable of imparting it to other bodies. Men generate Men, seed and
vegetables their like: Metals and minerals however have no Art of multiplying,
but so soon as they break themselves off from their stem, or are tormented
by fire, their Tingeing Spirit or growing Art disappears, and no artist
is likely to catch this Spirit. However, to help these Artists and to advise,
I have brought up enough. Consider diligently what Flamel says: Many have
sought it in lead and tin, others in steel and copper, still more in silver
and Mercury; I however have sought and found it in Gold: But I say to you,
were you able to obtain and have the Tincture-Essence (The Center of the
Macroscosm), so you are Master over everything. Now each stands free to
grasp it whenever he will, for it is yet universal in the above-mentioned
single Subject. For this reason it is named the Tinctura Aurum Physicum
or Tincturea-Physicorum. Within the Aurum Physicum no ordinary gold is
able to grow: For one sees at first, that ordinary gold and silver not
only dissolves in our Liquor without clashing and crashing, but are also
increased in weight.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have said, that who would have the Universal Stone,
also must have and know the one true Universal Materia, otherwise he would
err, as so many others. One makes no shoes out of Paper, still fewer make
houses or walls out of snow. Thus it must and should be something, wherefrom
all the three Kingdoms have taken their origin, growth, and continuance.
I want to say this once more: It is called our Aqua Mercurii, Spiritus
conservator omnium rerum, our electrum minerale immaturatum. Our Life,
and perfection of all things, our Single One: Our Fire, Water, Air and
earth, our Sal Metallorum, our Sal Philosophorum, our Sun and Moon: Nitrum
Philosophorum, Wind, Mist, and Celestial Dew.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently you will ask: How and where should I get
such, from where, through what, with what? Many authors have written of
this: Neiter, Theophrastus, Basilius, Helvetius, <i>Aureum Vitulum</i>,
Digby, Sendivogius and Ali Puli.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell you this much however, that the rays
of the Sun and Moon and Dew must be collected in a clean Jar or Vessel,
separated from Rain and dirt, stench, smoke, and also from flying and wandering
animals. The ways of attraction are many, but it is as well at home, as
in an open place in the wind. As also a most fit and convenient Receptacle.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a great Thunderstorm, with storm wind and downpour
this Spirit which the Sun has earlier drawn from the Earth (plentiful and
in great abundance) is driven up into the air, and then is thrown down
into the lowest Region, and gathered in great quantity by both men and
plants; thus also with the previously prepared receptacles. In a thunderstorm,
if the wind blows from the South, Southeast, or Southwest, it is good;
great cold and great heat, give nothing. The dew collected from grass or
trees, is already spoiled. The place of capture must not be marshy, have
no great mountains, houses or towers or high trees before it, but rather
stand open and free; the place should be open, smooth, and even fro South
to North; the vessel should stand at least 6 feet over the earth, neither
higher nor lower, smoke and fire must not be a hindrance. The Current of
air is not to be despised, if such were driven through a narrow space,
into a spacious room: Who knows how to arrange this same Modus correctly,
will fear no calamity; Receptacle and place must have a harmonious Adaptation
and the Spiritus Mercurii should be collected Copiously. Enough of the
capture of the Spiritus Mercurii.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have 8, 10, 12, 16 ounces, let it putrefy
for 40 days in a well closed Alembic or Vial, or however it suits you.
After putrefaction, divide your Materia into several parts; take 1 or 2
ounces, and let it dry, draw your material into several parts; take 1 or
2 ounces, and let it dry, draw you’re your Salt out of the Caput Mortuum
and add thereto as much Spiritus Mercurii, as there was in the beginning,
or a little less. Let it again dry gently; when it has dried, give the
Child fresh Milk, out of which originated, half as much as before, then
have in store the third Portion, of your whole Spiritus Mercurii; divide
it into 7 equal Portions, and soak your Materia seven times, but each time
well dried, until the 7th soaking and drying: So then give the tincture
its Ferment, either Sol or Luna in a crucible in a strong fire for 3 or
4 days, that the metals stands in flux or continual fusion, and so our
heavenly Salt of all metals ennobled and together with either Sol or Luna
transmuted to a tincture. When this occurs, take a little of this tincture,
wrapped in Wax, projected on imperfect metals, when in fusion, so you will
accomplish Miracles. Now be contented, fear God and follow these my true
instructions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all Writings, that I to my knowledge have ever
read, none are to be found so clear, undisguised, and honest, and written
without deceit, than this is.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God gives you the gift to find the Single One, seek
the single vessel, oven and Fire, and let all other things alone: As various
Matters, vessels, Phials, Solvents, bowls, mirrors, dishes, wood, coal,
and other fire works. It costs nothing from the beginning to end, except
your necessary maintenance, as nourishment and clothing. If you will understand
the matter correctly, so also it will cost you little. Therefore I believe,
that certainly God is everything in everything, and over everything; that
if someone would make known to you, that there are great expenses here
and there, that same one is a capital liar and fraud. For the Matter costs
absolutely nothing, as that you accordingly work and take pains, mirror,
polished dishes, vials and Solvent vessels, one can also have at a low
price. A common vessel will perform as well as an expensive one, if only
it is not porous or broken. Otherwise you need no expensive costs for the
work, not even a Penny. If I should reveal to a Simpleton the Secret Materia
and mode of proceeding, I certainly believe he would call me a boaster,
clown, and moreover would believe that I build Castles in the Air; and
might quite well believe that I have been robbed of my senses. And yet
so simple and common are our Materia and method of Operation; so great,
so noble, so glorious, so valuable, and so indescribably great are its
virtues: For consider, our Universal Subject, is even the Thing, which
no thing in the World can do without; it is a vile thing, and yet it is
in the particular, viz. our fixed Mature Salt.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beware of all Particulars, for Nothing Particular
is Universal: It is forever certain, he, who is a possessor of the true
Art, does not need to take pains about money for himself, for as he only
takes our putrefied Electrum Minerale Immaturum, extracts its salt (it
goes quite naturally) lays pure or unfixed metal therein, pours on so much
of our milk, that its salt therein can again dissolve itself, so will he
see, that water and salt, not only ennoble and increase gold and silver,
but also the vulgar mercury or Saturn, if you put this to it, is ennobled
in the same way, that you will wonder at it. Think you, that this Particular
be worth not a hundred thousand, but still more dollars; I think yea a
hundred times more; one can then work Particularly as he wishes: Alone
the same way to the great thing is much easier with less effort and expenses.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to what follows, I don’t want to mention
much ore, because the premature hastiness of opinion of the various readers
would like to hold on in doubt and mistrust: There is no Matter, no Art,
no handicraft in the whole world, that has more snares than the Chymistry.
All impoverished and vulgar merchants ad tradesmen, shoemakers, locksmiths,
glaziers, beer-brewers, brandy-distillers, Layers, school-masters, persons,
nobles and ignobles, as soon as they fail to win, he wants to know how
to remove and compensate all their losses through Alchemy. These begin
to build houses and castles, buy goods, Manors, yea whole estates; but
these plans and projects are only vain dreams; they know neither the True
Subject nor the Method of Proceeding, thereby they fall ever deeper into
poverty as well as great infirmity and sickness: Thus it is true, as Via
Veritatis says:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These same people, then begin to write, just as if
they understood the matter quite well, and had gained great profit thereby;
for this reason they also become great bunglers: For they have dissolved,
so long, until all their Gold and goodness melts and dissolves away, also
sublimated so long, until all their clothes on their bodies have rotted:
Also they have calcinated so long until all their Wood and Coal have become
ashes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that everyone who is skillful at Particular Processes
has to wait; for who knows the true subject, doesn’t bother with Particulars.
This I believe, if you are cleaver and wise, you will not blame me for
believing this of you, if you are old and poor enough, and have searched
diligently into all bodies, you will firstly grant to me, that you behaved
like a fool, uselessly spending time and money: Therefore God would watch
over all pious hearts, and let his all creating blessing--filled hand be
perceived to everyone; but if not through this, then by another way and
Art.

<p><b><font size=+1>Appendix</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Rules borrowed from Sendivogius, Together
with the Verse.
<p>Four Elements: Fire, Air, Water, Earth ---&nbsp; from God.
<br>Three Beginnings: Sulphur, Salt, Mercury --- from Nature.
<br>Two Seeds: Masculine, Feminine --- from the Metals.
<br>One Fruit: Tincture --- through Art.
<p>Who understands this table correctly
<br>Sees how one goes from out of the other.
<br>First everything dwells in a 4-fold state
<br>The elements everywhere.
<p>Out of this the 3 Beginnings spring.
<br>Which bring forth two Sexes.
<br>Masculine, feminine from Sun and Moon.
<p>Out of which grows the Wise Son:
<br>Who is like nothing else in the world\He surpasses all Kingdoms.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is known to man, that God in this great Cosmos
had given a living Spirit to all creatures, to maintain, multiply and to
nourish themselves, This Spirit they have not only in themselves, but they
are supported also by the heavenly Influence: This Spirit is Man’s true
Balsam and Mumia, and State of Wisdom, whereby He is discerned by all creatures,
or being different from all creatures. Also this Spirit and Vita Mundi
is the true Balsam of Nature and Quintesence
