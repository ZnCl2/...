<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the best red transparent oar of gold, as much
as you can have, drive it Spirit from it through a Retort; this is the
<i>Azoth</i>
and the <i>Acetum</i> of Philosophers, from its proper minera, which openeth
radically <i>Sol</i> that is prepared.
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the Minera of <i>Venus</i> or <i>Saturn</i>, drive
their spirits in a Retort, each of these dissolveth Gold radically, after
its purification.
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take Pulverized oar of <i>Saturn</i>, or vulgar <i>Saturn</i>
calcined, extract its salt with <i>Acetum</i>, or its <i>Antinae</i>, purifie
it in the best manner, that it be transparent as Crystall, and sweet as
honey, and be fluid in heat like Wax, and brittle when cold.
<p>This is the Tree, which is cut off, of unwholesome Fruits, on which
must be inoculated the twigs of <i>Sol</i>.
<p>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of that earth which lyeth waste in the Field,
found everywhere in Moorish grounds, into which the Astrals ejaculate their
operations, being adorned with all manner of Colours, appearing like a
Rainbow; extract from it its purest and subtillest. This is the Universal
<i>Menstruum</i>
for all; and is all in all.
<p>V.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the Oar of <i>Sol</i> and <i>Mercurie</i> a like
quantity, grinde each very well, pour on it the Spirit of <i>Mercurie</i>,
that it stand over 3 fingers deep; dissolve and digest it in a gentle warmth.
<p>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the best <i>Vitriol</i>, or of the <i>Vitriol</i>
of <i>Venus</i>, drive their Spirits in a Retort, white and red; with this
red Spirit being rectified and sweetened, you may ferment and inbibe the
subtile Gold Calx, and with the white Spirit you may dissolve it after
it hath been purified.
<p>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take quick <i>Mercurie</i>, purifie and dissolve it
so long in alcolisated spirit of Wine, till its impurity be separated from
it, and become into its extream transparent easie fluid essence; like unto
the white gluten of the Eagle,&nbsp; and capable to receive the blood of
the Red Lyon.
<p>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Extract the salt of the crude and white calcined Tartar,
Purifie and Clarifie it as often, till it be bright as the tear of the
Eye, and can be brought no higher; therewith you may sharpen its own spirit
of Wine, which dissolveth <i>Sol</i> and <i>Lune</i>.
<p>IX.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the rank poisonous matter or stone, called <i>Kerg
Swaden</i>, or husks of the Metals, drive its spirit very circumspectly,
receive it so, that it may turn unto water, it reduceth all metals to a
potableness.
<p>X.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the ayre or heavenly dew, being well purified,
ten parts, and of subtile Gold Calx one part, set it in digestion, dissolve
and coagulate it.
<p>XI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the Urine of a wholesome Man, that drank merely
Wine, make of it, according to Art, the Salt of Microcosme, purifie it
very well, which doth so much accuate the Spirit of Wine, that it dissolveth
<i>Sol</i>
in a moment.
<p>XII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of the best Oar of Gold, pulverize it very well,
seal it with <i>Hermes</i> his Seal, set it so long into the vaporous fire,
till you see it spring up ad grow a white and red Rose.
<p>XIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; This last Experiment he calleth the <i>Light</i>.
Take in the name of the Lord, of <i>Hungarish</i> Gold, which hath been
cast thrice through <i>Antimony</i>, and be laminated most thinly, as much
of it as you will, and make with quick <i>Mercury</i>, an Amalgame, then
calcine it most subtilly, with flowers of Sulpher, and Spirit of Wine burnt,
as often, till there remaineth a fair subtile Gold Calx, of a purple color.
Take one part of it, and two parts of the above mentioned red matter, grind
it very well together for an hour on a warmed Marble, the cement and calcine
well by degrees for three hours in a circle fire. This work must be Iterated
three times, then pour on it of the best rectified spirit, that it stand
over it three fingers deep; set it in a gentle and warm digestion, for
six days to be extracted, then the Spirit of Wine will be tinged as deep
as blood; cant of that tincture, and pour on another, as long as it will
tinge; put all these tinged Spirits of Wine into a Violl, so that the fourth
part only be filled, and seal it hermetically, set it on the vaporous fire
of the first degree, let it be of that heat as hot as the Sun shineth in
<i>July</i>;
let it stand this for forty days, then you shall obtain your wish.
<p>The Author recommendeth this last Experiment very highly, affirming
upon his experimental practice, that this <i>aurum Potabile</i> is the
highest medicine next unto the universal, and being taken in appropriated
vehicles, Cureth all Diseases, without causing any pains at all.
<p><i>Item</i>, With this <i>Aurum Paotabile</i> is Antimony prepared,
so that it purgeth only downwards, and carrieth fort all ill humours without
molestation, and is called the <i>purging gold</i>; hence are his Pills
of Gold.
<p>It is prepared also by the help of <i>Antimony</i> into a diaphoretick
gold, to expel by sweating all malignant humours; and <i>Mercurius vitae</i>
is made also with potable gold (if it be kept in a long digestion), their
dose is according to the Quality of the person.
