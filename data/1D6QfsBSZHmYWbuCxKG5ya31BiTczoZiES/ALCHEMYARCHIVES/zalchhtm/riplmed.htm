<br><b><font size=+1>The Preface of the Arch-Bishop of York</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> I shall endeavor Sir, to explicate, open, and make plan to
you, the Secrets of Alchymie, which I have attained to, by my Travels through
Italy, and other Countries and Kingdoms for the space of Nine Years, drawing
Forth, and Selecting the true Root, and Marrow of Nature (by a series of
experiences) from its most inward Recesses, and secret Habitations.
<p><b>II.</b> The which I am moved and compelled to from the singular Good-will,
entire Affections, and Sincere Love, which as well as in times past, I
now at present bear unto you: And therefore shall faithfully (tho’ briefly)
declare the Secrets of this Art to you; plainly and openly, not Darkly
and Aenigmatically, as if it was done under a Shadow or Veil.
<p><b>III.</b> Such indeed is your Life (Your Works witnessing the same)
that you are as a healing Balm, a Refuge of Defense, and Shelter to the
Church of God, a Pillar of his Holy Temple, for which Reasons, I am obliged
to reveal these hidden mysteries, and made known to you the abscondite
Paths of Nature, not to rejoice your outward Man only, by adding Health
and long Life, heaping up Treasures, and external Honours and Applause,
in the World, but to excite in you the highest Devotion to God Almighty,
that you might become good to all Men, profitable to the Church, a Father
to the Fatherless, and a Sanctuary to the Needy and Distressed.
<p><b>IV.</b> And in these things, I am confident of you, in whom is found
a Portion and Treasure of Virtue, Prudence, Piety, and true Wisdom, but
most chiefly, for that I know you yo be such a one, who has God always
before your Eyes.
<p><b>V.</b> And therefore I speak truly and fervently, and I will declare
the truth to you, with all faithfulness according to the reality of my
Soul; I shall Elucidate the undoubted verity, and declare such things,
as with much Labour, Care, and Diligence I have sought out, and obtained
the knowledge of; which I have seen with my Eyes, and have handled with
my Hands, and which my own self has done: and in this matter I will neither
be tedious nor obscure, lest that love which I profess to you, should seem
to be deficient or imperfect.
<p><b>VI.</b> Whatever I write, I shall open the same briefly and plainly
beseeching God, that the matter whereof I shall entreat, may become profitable
unto you; and that if you shall please to put the same into practice you
may find the faithful experience thereof, and not be deceived, or spend
your time in vain: For we know certainly, that of all transitory, Time
is truly the most precious.
<p><b>VII.</b> Wherefore I write unto you (honourable and dearly beloved
Friend) such things only as may be profitable; making this humble suit
unto your Excellency, that the Revealed Secrets and Experiments which I
send you in this little Book, may not be prostituted, or bestowed upon
unworthy Men, who are naughty, or swollen up with Pride, or whose Souls
are bound up in their Covetousness.
<p><b>VIII.</b> I require not of you for this Secret, a great Sum of Gold
or Silver; nor do I put this Secret in writing, for you to bestow much
Cost and Expenses upon it; nor do I for my self desire any reward, these
things agree not with the Philosophik Verity, which professes, that its
Works are not chargeable and Expensive. Morienus saith, beware that you
spend nothing in this Magistery of Gold. And Dastine, saith with the Value
of one Noble is the whole Magistery performed.
<p><b>IX.</b> Since then it is so, in what thing is our Gold to be found?
Is it not in Mercury, which is called Quick or living Gold? Raymondus saith,
He that will reduce Quick Gold into thin water, must make it, do it, and
Work it by its contrary. For saith he, Quick or living Gold, has in its
self, four Natures, and four humours or Elements. And therefore saith he,
if you putrefy its Cold with its Hot, and its Dry with its Moist, you shall
not only have the Humidity of all Bodies, but you shall have a Mentruum,
which will dissolve Argent Vive for ever. For the least part of Mercury
being once dissolved, the dissolved Mercury will always dissolve Mercury
ad Infinitum.
<p><b>X.</b> Mercury may as well be called Quick-Gold, as Quick-Silver,
for it contains them both. If Air will make this Separation, we must put
thereto divers contrary things, as Roger Bacon saith in Speculo. But this
putrefaction cannot be done, till it is dissolved in Water white as Milk,
putrefy that Milk 15 days in B.M., then separate its Element, and cleanse
its Earth, and after that join it again in equal weight, then is the Elixir
made compleat for Saturn and Jupiter. Quick-Gold is Crude, Imperfect, and
unfixt in every degree, and yet it is accounted a Body, altho’ there be
no fixation in it, and therefore it may be much sooner brought to its first
matter, than any other of the Bodies, that have any part of fixation in
them, for they must have much Labour and long time to separate them, and
bring them back into their fixt matter.
<p><b>XI.</b> For saith Lully, The Elements of Mercury may be dissolved,
and being so dissolved, they may be separated. There be some that think
our Resoluble Seed, or dissolved Menstruum, is the water of Argent Vive,
made only by it self, because it does dissolve both Metals, and pretious
Stones which we call Pearls; and so it is. Now how this dissolving Menstruum
is made, not only Raymond seems to shew, but Roger Bacon in like manner
in his Speculum Alchymia, were he saith, put the Body which is most weighty,
into a Sistillatory, and draw forth thereof, its Sweet Rose, or Dew, with
a little Wind, or Breath: For betwixt every drop of Water, comes forth
a Breath, as it were of a Man, which is the substance of Argent Vive, and
which the Philosophers call our Mercury; which if it be well putrefied
before hand, will then yield the more, and issue out forcibly, as it were
Wild-Fire out of a Trunk, especially when the Red Fume comes. Thus have
you one of our Argent Vives.
<p><b>XII.</b> To the same thing Raymundus assents, where he saith, then
have you that Argent Vive, which is called Ours; and so it is indeed one
of Our Argent Vive; altho’ the intent of the same Philosopher in <i>Libro
Animae Artis Transmutatoriae</i>, Cap. 2 was touching another more noble
and more excellent Water (supposed by some, to be Our Burning-Water, drawn
out of the Gum of Vitriol) by the Virtue of which most Noble and Excellent,
attractive Water, he doth not only often dissolve the Body of Sol (not
as he doth it with the aforesaid Argent Vive commonly dissolved) but also
the same solar Body, by force of that attractive Virtue, is disposed in
a more noble manner; as I my self have seen done, no only in the Metalline
Elixir, but also in the Elixir of Life, as hereafter shall be declared,
Chap. 71, 72, Sect.
<p><b>XIII.</b> It is fancied by an Experienced Philosopher, that Mercury
did speak, and said, I am the Father of Enchantments, Brother of the Sun,
and Sister to the Moon, I am the Water of Life drawn out of Wine (i.e.,
out of the Wine of Mercury) I kill that which was alive, and make alive
that which was dead; I make Black, and I make White, and I carry in my
Belly the Sol of Philosophers; and therefore he that can joyn me after
that I am dissolved, and made the pure cleat and Silver like Water, called
Lac Virginis, with my Brother the Sun, he shall tinge him with my Soul,
not only much more than he was before by an hundred fold, but also if he
be joined with my Sister Luna, he shall make all things fair and bright.
This Lac Virginis is a Silver-like Water somewhat thick.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXII.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>A Farther Discourse of thePhilosophers Mercury</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> Of this Mercury, speaks another Philosopher thus, when its
Elements are separated, and again joyned and mixed together by equal weight,
then is it made a compleat Elixir upon Saturn and Jupiter; but its Elements
cannot be separated, until such time as it is dissolved: and of this Metalline
Water, ought the Artist to draw the Tincture.
<p><b>II.</b> The Elements of Mercury being separated, and again commixed
by equal weight or proportion, make the Elixir compleat with often dissolving
and congealing of the Spirit, which must be done upon a Marble Stone, weighing
the Body, and then taking its weight of the Secret Salt, grinding them
together very subtil, then putting them into Balneo, that they may be dissolved;
which done, take it out, and make your congelation a dry Fire, do so oftentimes,
and then, etc.
<p><b>III.</b> And therefore to confirm this, Raymundus saith, O my Son,
Our Tincture is drawn out of one Vile thing, and is decked, finished, and
ended with another thing which is more Noble; for we do Ferment it with
Vulgar Gold: He calls it Vile, because he saith it is sometimes found in
Vile Places, as in Old Draughts: also it is Vile, because (as Raymundus
saith) it is found not only in a filthy form, and ugly shape, but because
it is in every thing, of the which (saith Albertus) is made a Permanent
or fixt Water.
<p><b>IV.</b> Here it is to be Noted, that Raymundus commands this Tincture
to be drawn out of the Body of Venus, which Tincture he does Ferment with
the prepared Calx of common Vulgar Gold.
<p><b>V.</b> And therefore saith Avicen, it behooves you to have a great
quantity of our Gold, and of our Silver, to the end, that thereby the humours
may be drawn forth: viz. to have at the least sixty pounds weight, which
will be a sufficient quantity for your whole life. He also saith, the best
Mercury is brought in skins, from Mount Pasullane. Of this Mercury, Geber
saith, you must labour in all your work to separate Mercury, you must labour
in all your work to separate Mercury or as others read it, to convince
or overcome Mercury, in commixing and conjoining; for he that cannot destroy
Mercury, or undo it in its composure, cannot repair or restore it: nor
may you work with it as Raymund saith, till it is dissolved.
<p><b>VI.</b> And therefore it is said, joyn not that which is Crude, with
that which is Decocted; for of that only with the Ferment, is made the
Elixir, which does congeal all manner of Argent Vive. Wherefore as Raymund
saith, it is never congealed without a congealing Sulphur; and being congealed,
you have a great secret: for in the dissolved, Decocted Mercury, is a great
and hidden Mystery.
<p><b>VII.</b> Another Philosopher also saith, that there is a certain
subtil Fume, which does spring forth from its proper Veins, dispersing
and spreading its self abroad the which thin Fume if it be wisely gathered
together again, and sprinkled upon its proper Veins or Matrix, it will
make not only a certain fixation (of which thin Fume, in short space is
made the true Elixir) but also cleanses the Impure Metals or Alchymick
Body.
<p><b>VIII.</b> As to the Tincture mentioned in Sect., 4 above, it rather
seems by other works of the said Raymundus, that he drew it out of Quick-Silver,
and no other vile thing, of which Mercury is made, What is meant at Sect.
6 by not joining the Crude with the Decocted, is to be understood of not
joining Crude mercury to the Decocted Bodies or Metals, but to put to them
Decocted, i.e., dissolved Mercury. And herein is hidden a great secret,
for Mercury being dissolved, is an hot and moist Sperm; but Crude, it is
cold and dry Saturn. So that if you putrefy its hot and moist Sperm with
its cold and dry Earth, you will have Quick-Silver dissolved, which is
not Crude, but Decocted Mercury. So that in Crude Mercury dissolved is
hidden a great Mystery. And however it is dissolved by a Fire not natural
or against Nature, yet it must be mixed, conjoined, fixed.
<p><b>IX.</b> This Alchymick Body is called Leprous Gold, wherein Gold
and Silver, are in Essence and Power, but not in fight or appearance; in
its Profundity or Depth, it is Airous or Spiritual Gold, which none can
obtain, unless the same Body be first made clean and pure. The which impure
Body after mundification, is a thousand times better than are the Bodies
of common Sol and Luna, Decocted by natural heat.
<p><b>X.</b> This Leprous Gold the Philosophers call, Adrop, or Adrup,
which Gold is the Philosophers Lead. This Alchymick Body (in his Concord)
he calls Venus in the lesser Work, both for Gold and Silver, because it
is a Neutral Body, and very easie to be changed to either: and by this
the sense of Sect. 4 and 8. aforegoing may be more easily understood. The
Earth, the uncleansed Body, is to be putrified with its own Water, and
afterwards nourished with its Mothers Milk, which is called the Sulphur
of nature.
<p><b>XI.</b> The first Matter of this unclean Alchymical Body is a Viscous
Water, which is thickened in the Bowels of the Earth. And therefore of
this Impure Body (as Vincent saith) is made the great Elixir of the Red
and White, whose name is Adrop, or Adrup, viz. the Philosophers Lead. From
the which Raymundus commands an Oyl to be drawn: from the Lead of the Philosophers
(saith he) let there be an Oyl drawn of a Golden Colour; if you can separate
this Oyl (wherein is Our second Tincture and Fire of Nature) from its Phlegm,
which is its waterishness, and wisely search out the Secret thereof, you
may in the space of thirty days perform the Work of the Philosophers Stone.
<p><b>XII.</b> This Oyl does not only make the medicine penetrable, being
amicable and conjoynable to all Bodies or Corporeal things, but it is also
the hidden or Secret fire of Nature; which dies so augment the Excellencies
of those Bodies to whim it is so joined, that it makes them to exceed in
infinite proportions of goodness and purity. So much as does appertain
to the Work of Alchimiae, which is only for the Elixir of Metals is now
sufficiently opened, which if you rightly understand, you will find that
no great cost is required to the performance of this Philosophic Operation.
<p><b>XIII.</b> The Innatural Fire is Our Aqua Foetens, or Sea-Water, sharp,
piercing, and burning all Bodies more fiercely than Elemental Fire, making
of the Body of Sol, a meer Spirit, which common Elemental Fire has not
power to do.
<p><b>XIV.</b> But this Elixir of Metals is not all that I intend to shew
you; the Elixir of Life is that which I chiefly designed, infinitely exceeding
all the Riches of this World, and to which the most excellent of all the
Earthly things cannot be compared. Ands therefore, I shall 1. Shew in the
mineral Kingdom, the Elixir of Metals, and that after divers manners. 2.
In the Vegetable Kingdom, the Elixir both of Metals, and of Life. 3. In
the Animal Kingdom, the Elixir of Life only; albeit the same Elixir of
Life is most excellent for the transmutation of Metalls.
<p><b>XV.</b> There are three things necessary to this Art, of which you
ought not to be ignorant, viz. 1. The Fire wherewith: the fire of Nature,
Innatural, elemental, and which is against Nature, destroying the special
form of all that is dissolved therein. 2. The Water whereby: as in the
Compound Water. 3. And the thing whereof: is made the congealed Earth,
as White as Snow. Of all which in their proper order.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXIII.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Of the Mineral Stone, and Philosophick Fires</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> On a time as I have learned, there was an Assembly of Philosophers,
where the Matter of the Secret Stone, and the Manner of working it, was
propounded. Several spoke their Opinions, but at length, one younger in
Years, and (as was thought) Inferior in Learning, declared his thoughts
and knowledge concerning that Secret. I know saith he, the Regimens of
the Fires. When they had heard what he could say, they all as amazed held
their peace for a while.
<p><b>II.</b> At length, one of the Company made answer; If this be true
which thou hast said, thou art Master of us all, and thereupon with one
consent, they gave him the Right Hand of Fellowship. Whereupon they gathered,
that the Secret of this wonderful Tincture lay chiefly in the Fire.
<p><b>III.</b> But the Fire differs after several manners; one Natural,
another against Nature. The Natural Fire does come from the Influence of
Sol, and Luna, and the Asterisms, or the Sun, Moon, and Stars, of the which
are Ingendered, not only the burning Waters, and potential Vapours of Minerals,
but also the Natural Virtues of living things.
<p><b>IV.</b> The Innatural or Preternatural Fire, is a thing accidental,
as heat in an Ague, being made Artificially, and called by the Philosophers
a moist Fire, Our generating Water, the fire of the first Degree; and for
the temperature of its Heat is called a Bath, a Stew, a Dunghill, in which
Dunghill is made the putrefaction of our Stone. See Sect. 13 of the former
Chapter, where it is more amply defined.
<p><b>V.</b> The Elemental fire, is that which does not Fix, Calcine and
Burn, and is nourished by Combustible things.
<p><b>VI.</b> The fire against Nature (which is a violent strong, Corrosive,
destroying the special form of that which is dissolved therein), is that
which in Power Dissolves, Frets, Infects, and destroys the generative Power
of the form of the Stone: it does Dissolve the Stone into Water of the
Cloud, with the loss of its Natural, Attractive, and special Form, and
is called Fire against nature (as Raymundus saith) from its Operation:
for that which Nature does make, this fire against Nature destroys and
beings to Corruption, unless there be fire of Nature put to it.
<p><b>VII.</b> Here as Raymundus saith, lies contrary Operations (as in
the Compounded Water) for as the fire against Nature, does Dissolve the
Spirit of the fixed Body; the Volatile Spirit is thereby constrained to
retire into a fixed Earth (a Congealed Earth as White as Snow).
<p><b>VIII.</b> For the fire of Nature does Congeal the dissolved Spirit
of the fixed Body into a glorious Earth: and the Body of the Volatile being
fixed, by the same fire against Nature, is here again by the fire of nature
resolved into the Water of the Philosophers, but not into the Water of
the Cloud: and so by this means the fixed is returned back again into its
wonted Nature of Flying, and the moist is made dry, and the ponderous is
made light.
<p><b>IX.</b> But yet he saith, this fire which is against Nature is not
the Work of our magistery, but it is the fire which is purely Natural.
This he saith, because he would shew us thereby the difference between
the Mineral Elixir, and the Vegetable, and the Animal. For that these three
several Waters, viz. Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal, which serve for the
Work divers ways.
<p><b>X.</b> And First we will Treat of the Mineral Elixir, then of the
other in order. The Fire against Nature (viz. the Humour or Tincture drawn
out of the Body of Venus Dissolved in its Mineral Spirit) very strong and
Mortal, serving only to the Mineral Elixir.
<p><b>XI.</b> This Mineral Water, or Fire against Nature, is drawn fire
Elemental, from a certain stinking Menstruum, as Raymundas saith, and is
made of four things. It is the strongest Water in the World, whose only
Spirit (saith he), does wonderfully increase and multiply the Tincture
of the Ferment: for here Sol or Gold is Tinged with the Mineral Spirit,
the which Mineral Spirit is the strength of the most simple Sulphur without
much Earthiness.
<p><b>XII.</b> Thin Mineral Water is the dropping of Adrop or Adrup, Venus,
which is the noble Tincture called the natural Roman Vitriol, and which
for the abundance of its noble Tincture, is called Roman Gold.
<p><b>XIII.</b> This some do call the Spirit of the Green Lyon, others
the blood of the Green Lyon: wherein almost all Err, and are deceived:
for the Green Lyon of the Philosophers, is that Lyon, by whose Virtue attractive,
all things are lifted up from the bowels of the Earth, and the Winter-like
Caverns, making them to Wax green and flourish: whose Child (for all the
Elixirs are to be had from it) is to us most acceptable and sufficient.
<p><b>XIV.</b> The Child of the Philosophers is generated of their Green
Lyon, of which Child is had the strength of Sulphur, both White and Red;
our two Sulphurs of Nature are the Gold and Silver of the Philosophers,
and their hidden Treasure.
<p><b>XV.</b> Of this Child of the Green Lyon of the Philosophers is drawn
the strength of Sulphur White and Red, but not Burning as Avicen saith,
which are the two best things the Alchymist can take to make his Gold and
Silver of: and this is sufficient to be said, for the attaining the knowledge
of the Green Lyon: which is so called, because, that when he is dissolved,
he is straight ways adorned with a green Vesture (i.e., When our Sulphur
of Nature is dissolved in its own menstruum, which is the Virgin’s Milk,
it is clothed with this greenness, and therefore called the Green Lyon).
<p><b>XVI.</b> But of the Green Lyon of Fools, this we say, that from it
with a strong fire is drawn Aquafortis, in the which, the aforesaid Philosophers’
Lyon of the Mineral Stone, ought to be Elixirated, and assumes its Name.
Raymundus saith, it were better, or safer, to eat the Eyes of a Basilisk,
than that Gold, which is made with the Fire against Nature.
<p><b>XVII.</b> And I say also, that the things from whence the same Aquafortis
is drawn is green Vitriol and Azoth: i.e., Vitriol Natural, not Artificial,
viz. the droppings of Copper, called also Roman Vitriol, Roman Gold, by
many of the Philosophers, from the abundance of its noble Tincture, the
which Tincture must be fermented with common Gold.
<p><b>XVIII.</b> How great and Secret a Virtue, then, and of what strength,
the Fire against Nature is, evidently appears in the construction of the
Body of the Volatile Spirit, being by it vulgarly sublimed in the form
of Snowy Whiteness. Raymundus in the end of the Epistle of his Abridgment
saith, feed Argent Vive with this Oyl, viz. with the Oyl, wherewith the
Spirit of the Quintessence is thickened, etc.
<p><b>XIX.</b> For want of such, Natural Vitriol, the true and natural
Principle, not Artificial (as Vincent saith) made of Salts, Sulphurs, and
Alums, which cut and gnaw Metals, is to be chosen, lest in the end of you
work you fail of your desire. The Philosophers will you to Calcine Sol
with Mercury Crude, till it be brought into a Calx Red as Blood: here comes
in the work of Sol and mercury together, brought into a dry Red Powder
and fixed, but whether it is to be done with Mercury or Sulphur, the Water
of him, is doubtful.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXIV</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>The Manner of Elixiration with the Fire Against Nature</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> Take the first Sol, Calcined with the first Water, viz. the
Mercurial Spirit, very clean, and brought into the Color of Blood, in the
space of 20 days (in lesser time it is not to be done). This Calcination
cannot be so profitable, as it would be, unless Sol be first Mercurialized
into such a thinness, as it may cleave together to that to which it must
be joined in a 24 fold proportion (viz. as 1 to 14) strained through a
clean Linen Cloth, without any remaining substance of the Gold.
<p><b>II.</b> I myself have seen it so ordered and done; and then it may
certainly, in a strong Bolt-head, well Luted on every side, except on Top,
boiling in a strong Fire for the space of 20 days, be precipitated into
a Red Powder, like Cinnabar (all which I have seen performed). Every particle
of this Powder you shall so fix, as that if it be put upon a Red-hot Iron
Plate, its Spirit shall not fume or fly away.
<p><b>III.</b> This Powder Dissolve with, or in our Fire against Nature;
being dissolved, abstract the Water of the Fire against Nature from it,
so long till the substance of the Powder so dissolved, do remain in the
Vessel, as thick as an Oyl; which Oyl, first, with a soft fire, and after
with a stronger, fix into dry Powder.
<p><b>IV.</b> This Work is not to be done all at once, but by little and
little at a time, till it goes through with it in the Color of Blood; then
will it precipitate into a Red Powder, called by the Philosophers Sericon:
Dissolve it with as much of Our Vegetable Sal Anatron, the space of an
hour, then set it in balneo, in a long Receptory, till it be cleanly dissolved,
and becomes as it were a fine Wine, which with the very softest heat, make
it to evaporate, and Congeal, so ill you have a pure Stone, and of subtil
parts.
<p><b>V.</b> Also if you dissolve this same Red Powder of Mercury in Water
or Spirit of Common Salt, prepared as Bacon and Albertus have taught, you
shall have an Oyl or Salt of Gold, which no Fire can destroy, which will
melt and tinge with a solar Color upon a Plate of Venus. This Treasure
carry always with you, wheresoever you go: Who knows not the Secret of
this prepared Salt in Our lesser Works, knows little of the hidden things
of Alchymie.
<p><b>VI.</b> Try this fixt Powder (at Sect. 3 above) for the fixation,
reiterate still the Work with the same Fire against Nature upon the same
Powder Ten times, and it will be dryed up no more into Powder, but remain
in a thick Oyl, the which will turn Argent Vive, and all Bodies into pure
Alchymick Gold, sufficiently good for all works of the Goldsmith, but not
for Medicine for Man’s Body.
<p><b>VII.</b> A Second way, Gold is much more wonderfully Elixirated by
the said Fire against Nature, compounded with the Fire Natural, after this
manner. Let Vitriol of the Fire of Nature, made of the most sharp Humidity,
or moisture of Grapes, and Sericon, joined together in a Mass, with the
Natural Mineral Vitriol (called the Gum of Adrop, or Vitriol Azoth), made
somewhat dry, and with Sal Nitre, be dissolved.
<p><b>VIII.</b> First ascends a fair, weak, Phlegmatic Water, which cast
away. Then a White Fume, making the Vessel appear White like milk, which
Fume must be gathered into the receiver, so long till it ceases, and the
Vessel becomes clear, of its own Color. This water of the White Fume is
the Stinking Menstruum, which is called Our Dragon against Nature. This
Menstruum, if the said Dragon against Nature was absent, would be our Fire
Natural, of which we shall hereafter speak in its proper place.
<p><b>IX.</b> Raymundus saith, this Water is made of four things: 1. The
Composition of Sal Amarum; 2. Menstruum Foetens; 3. Argent Vive, which
is a common substance in every combustible body; 4. Mineral Vitriol.
<p><b>X.</b> This compounded Water Mineral, and Water Vegetable, being
mixed together, and made one Water as aforesaid, doth work contrary Operation,
which is wonderful, it Dissolves and Congeals, it makes moist and dry,
it putrifies and purifies; it divides asunder and joyns together; it destroys
and restores; it kills and makes alive; it wounds and heals again; it makes
soft and hardens; it makes thin and thick; it resolves Compounds, and Compounds
again: It begins the Work and makes an end of the same.
<p><b>XI.</b> These two Mineral Waters Compounded together in one, are
the two Dragons Fighting and striving to gather one against the other in
the Flood of Satalia: viz. The White Fume and the Red; and one of them
shall devour the other. And here the Solutory Vessels ought to be Luted
but gently, or closed with Linen Cloth, or with Mastick, or common Wax,
or Cerecloth.
<p><b>XII.</b> These two Dragons are Fire and Water, within the Vessel
and not without; and therefore if they feel any exterior Fire, they will
rise up to the top of the Vessel, and if they be yet forced by the violence
or strength of the Fire, they will break the Vessel, and so you will lose
all your Work.
<p><b>XIII</b>. This Compounded Water aforesaid, does Congeal as much as
it does Dissolve, and lifts it up into a glorious Crystalline Earth. This
is our Secret dissolution of the Stone, which is always done with the Congelation
of its Water. The Fire of Nature is here put to the Fire against Nature;
therefore as much as the Stone has lost of its form by the power and strength
of the Water, or Fire against Nature; so much has it gotten and recovered
again of its form, by the Virtue of the Water, or Fire of Nature, by means
of the Fire of Nature, cannot be destroyed.

<br><b><font size=+1>The Practice of the Said Compounded Water, Upon the
Calx of the Body Dissolved</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> The Practice with the said Compounded Water, upon the Calx
of the Body duly dissolved and prepared: Take the prepared Body (made with
a thick Oyl), put to it so much of the Compounded Water as may cover the
same Calx with Our Vegetable Menstruum) by the depth of half an Inch. The
Water will presently boil over the Calx without external dissolving the
Stone, and lifting it up into the form of Ice, with the drying up also
of the said Water.]
<p><b>II</b>. The said Calx being so dissolved and sublimed into the form
of Ice, you must take away; after this is done, the residue of the Calx
remaining in the Vessel, undissolved, shall again be well dryed by the
Fire, upon which put so much of the said Compounded Water as you did before,
dissolving, subliming and drying, till the Calx is wholly dissolved.
<p><b>III.</b> The substance thus dissolved, subtily separated and brought
into a Powder, must be put (as thereafter shall be shewed) into a good
quantity of the Fire of Nature (which is a Quintessence) the same being
first well rectified, and the Vessel well stopped, to the end, that the
means of the heat outwardly administered unto it, procuring the inward
heat to work, it may be dissolved into an Oyl; the which will soon be done,
by reason of the simplicity of the Water, or simple Fire of Nature.
<p><b>IV.</b> And therefore when you have brought the said Powder so dissolved,
sublimed, and prepared with the said Compounded Water into an Oyl (then
is our Menstruum Visible unto sight) by putting thereto a good quantity
of the aforesaid rectified simple Fire of Nature, as before declared; then
abstract or draw away the said Water again for the same Oyl, by Distilling
the same in a moist, Temperate heat, so long till there remains in the
bottom of the Glass a thin Oyl.
<p><b>V.</b> This Oyl, the oftener it is dissolved with the said simple
rectified Fire of nature, and the said Water Abstracted or Distilled by
a Temperate heat, so much the more will the said Oyl be made subtil and
thin.
<p><b>VI.</b> With the said Oyl (provided the Calx be the Calx of Sol and
Luna) you may incere the substances or Calxes of other Bodies, the said
Bodies being first dissolved, exalted, sublimed, and prepared with the
said Compounded Water, in manner and form of Ice aforesaid, till that by
the Inceration of the said subtil and thin Oyl of Sol and Luna, the said
substances of other Bodies be made fixed, and to flow like Wax.
<p><b>VII.</b> With which flowing substance, you shall not only congeal
Argent Vive into perfect Sol and Luna, according as you have prepared your
Medicine, but you shall also with the same flexible and flowing substance,
transmute and change all such other imperfect Bodies (as they were, whose
Calxes were so sublimed, and from whom, at their first sublimating or lifting
up, they took their beginning) into Sol and Luna aforesaid.
<p><b>VIII.</b> And this thin and subtil Oyl, being put into Kemia its
proper Vessel, first sealed up, to putrify in the Fire of the first degree,
being moist: it becomes as black as liquid Pitch. The fire may then have
its Action in the Body, to corrupt it (the same Body as before so opened).
<p><b>IX.</b> Therefore it grows first black, like melted Pitch, because
the heat working in this moist Body, does first beget a blackness, which
blackness is the first sign of Corruption: and since the Corruption of
one thing is the generation of another; therefore of the Body corrupted,
is generated a Body Neutral, which is certainly apt, declinable, and applicable
unto every Ferment whatsoever you please to apply it to.
<p><b>X.</b> But the Ferment must be altered together with the Alchemick
Body; and the whole substance of our Stone or Elixir must partake of the
Nature of the Quintessence, otherwise it will be of no effect.
<p><b>XI.</b> And between the said sign of blackness and perfect whiteness,
which will follow the said blackness, there will appear a green Color,
and as many variable Colors afterwards as the mind of Man is able to conceive.
<p><b>XII.</b> When the present White Color shall begin to appear like
the eyes of fishes, then may you know that Summer is near at hand, after
which Autumn or harvest will happily follow with ripe fruit, which in the
long looked for Redness: This is after the Pale, Ashy, and Citrine Color.
<p><b>XIII.</b> First the Sun does perfectly Descend by its due Course,
from its Meridional height and Glory, through height and Glory, through
its gross and natural solution into an imperfect Pale, and Ashy Color,
shining in the Occidental parts of the West, which is somewhat of a yellowish
or Brick dust Color: from thence it goes to the Septentrional parts of
the Earth, being of a Variable waterish blackness, of a dark, cloudy, alterable,
putrefaction waterishness.
<p><b>XIV.</b> Then it ascends up to the Oriental parts, shining with a
more perfect Crystalline, Summerlike, and Paradisiacal White: Lastly, he
ascends his Fiery Chariot, directing his Course up again up again to this
Meridional Life, Perfection and Glory, there to Rule and Shine, in fire,
brightness, splendor, and the highest perfection, even in the highest,
most pure, and Imperial Redness.
<p><b>XV.</b> When this aforesaid simple Oyl of the altered Body, being
in its Vessel duly sealed, is by the Fire thus disposed, what is there
more than one simple thing, which nature has made to be generated of Sulphur
and Mercury in the Bowels of the Earth?
<p><b>XVI.</b> Thus it is evident, that our Stone is nothing else but Sol
and Luna, Sulphur and mercury: Male and Female; heat and Cold. And therefore
(to be more short) when all the parts of our Stone, are thus gathered together,
it appears plainly enough, what is our Mercury, Our Sulphur, Our Alchemick
Body, Our Ferment, Our Menstruum, Our Green Lyon: And what Our White Fume,
Our two Dragons, Our Fire, and Our Egg, in which is both the Whiteness
and the Redness.
<p><b>XVII.</b> As also what is Man’s Blood, Our Aqua Vitae, Our Burning
Water, and what are many other things, which in this Our Art are Metaphorically,
or figuratively named to deceive the Foolish and unwary.
<p><b>XVIII.</b> Also there is a similitude of a Triune, shining, in the
Body, Soul and Spirit, The Body is the substance of the Stone. The Soul
is the Ferment which cannot be had, but from the most perfect Body; and
the Spirit is that which raiseth up the Natures from Death and Corruption
to Life, Perfection and Glory.
<p><b>XIX.</b> In Sulphur, there is an Earthiness for the Body: In Mercury,
there is an Aerealness for the Spirit, and in them both a Natural Unctuosity
for the Soul or Ferment; all which are inseparably United in their least
parts for ever: From this Fermental Body the Stone is formed, and without
it, it cannot be made.
<p><b>XX.</b> It is the peculiar property of Sol and Luna (the which property
appertains to the Stone itself) to give the form of gold and Silver. And
therefore the Elixir, whether it be White or Red, may be Infinitely augmented
with the Fermental Oyl: if you do cast the same upon Mercury, it shall
transmute it into the Elixir, which Elixir must be cast afterwards upon
the Imperfect Bodies.
<p><b>XXI.</b> Moreover the said White Elixir is augmented with Mercurial
Water, and the Red Elixir with the Mercurial Oyl; the which two, viz. the
Mercurial Water and mercurial Oyl, can only be had of Mercury dissolved
of itself.
<p><b>XXII.</b> See what the Scripture saith, he stroke the Stone and Water
flowed out, and he brought forth Oyl out in the Flinty Rock. We may Note
the whole composition of the Elixir in these four Verses following.
<p><b>XXIII.</b> He stretched forth the Heavens as a Curtain. The Waters
stood above the Mountain. This is the Water which does cover Our matter,
and performs the dissolution thereof, causing a cloudy Ascension. That
does walk upon the Wings of the Wind. This figures forth the sublimation
of our Stone.
<p><b>XXIV.</b> Who makes his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers a flame
of Fire. By this is shadowed forth the rectification, separation, and disposition
of the Elements. Who has founded the Earth upon its basis; so fixt, that
it shall not be moved for ever. Under which is described the fixation of
the Elements, and the perfection of the Philosophic Stone.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXVI</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Another Way of Elixirating Gold by the Fire Against
Nature</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> Another way, by which the Body of Gold is Elixirated by the
power of the Fire against Nature, through the help of the Operation of
the Fire of Nature; which is thus. Dissolve the Body of pure Gold in the
Fire against Nature, the same fire being well rectified Arsenick as the
manner is; from which Gold being so dissolved into a Citrine, clear and
shining Water, without any Heterogenity or Sand remaining, let the water
be abstracted, till the Body dies remain in the bottom of the Glass, like
a fixt Oyl.
<p><b>II.</b> Upon this Oyl, affuse the said Water or Fire against Nature
again, and abstract again, and this work so often repeat till the Water
or fire against Nature, have no more sharpness upon the Tongue than common
Well-water.
<p><b>III.</b> This done, draw another new Water or fire against nature,
which affuse upon the former Oyl, and abstract in all respects as before
is taught: then Affuse upon this Oyl the Water or fire of Nature well rectified,
and let it be double in quantity or proportion of the said Oyl of the Body
so dissolved, and put it into a Vessel, which stop well, and set it in
Balneo for seven days; so will the Water or fire of Nature become a Citrine
Color.
<p><b>IV.</b> This Water or fire of nature by its attractive Virtue, will
draw away the Tincture from the fire against Nature, as Raymundus saith
in his practical Alphabet. And although it is somewhat opposite to Nature,
to dissolve the Bodies with the fire against Nature; yet if you know how
to comfort the matter with the fire of nature, and by Balneation in 15
days, to draw it from the blackness of the water, or fire against Nature
(the which may be done, as I have proved, in 6 days) you shall perfect
the work, and attain the desired end.
<p><b>V.</b> Let the aforesaid Natural Water or fire of Nature, so tinged
with a yellow Color, be always warily emptied, and poured off from the
aforesaid dissolved Bodies, into another Vessel, with a narrow Mouth, that
may be firmly stopped: and then with more of the said fire, let there be
made in Balneo, in the space of time aforesaid, another quantity of the
said Oyl.
<p><b>VI.</b> And so the same water being tinged with Sol or Gold, let
it be warily emptied, and poured off as before: and when the water of Nature
will be tinged no more, then it is a sign, that the Tincture is all drawn
forth from the dissolved Body by the Fire against Nature.
<p><b>VII.</b> Put the Tinctures thus decanted off into a Glass Stillatory,
and with a soft or easie Fire abstract the Water or Fire of nature from
the same, so long till you see in the bottom an Oyl; to which you must
put New Fire of Nature again, well rectified: and after the Matter has
stood in Balneo for the space of 6 days, then abstract the said water or
fire of Nature by distillation.
<p><b>VIII.</b> And let the work with the same water be repeated upon and
from the said Oyl, after the same manner so long till you have brought
your Oyl of Gold to be the most subtil and pure, without any Foeculent
grossness, wherein let nothing of the water or fire of Nature be left behind,
but the substance of Gold only, turned to Oyl.
<p><b>IX.</b> This subtil and pure Oyl of Gold, being put in Kemia, or
its proper Vessel, and firmly sealed up, may be the aforesaid Regimens
be changed into the great Elixir, as it is shewed before with the other
simple Oyl, made with the Compounded Water, in the former practice, at
Sect. 8, Chap. 65 aforegoing.
<p><b>X.</b> But to proceed: sublime Quick Silver with Roman Vitriol and
prepared or Calcined Salt; and after that sublime it by itself alone three
times from its foeculent substance. This done, and the same made into Powder,
put this sublimate Powder into a fixatory Vessel, and put thereto a certain
quantity of your aforesaid Oyl of Gold, but so much only, as may scarcely
cover the sublimate: firmly close the Vessel, and set it in a soft Fire,
till the Natures are perfectly joined together.
<p><b>XI</b>. This done, grind it upon a Marble, and Incinerate it again
with your said Oyl of Gold, and after put it again into its Fixatory Vessel,
under a fire of the first Degree as before, and let the same Vessel stand
twice as long as it did before, to the intent that the Natures may be firmly
Compact and United together.
<p><b>XII.</b> Now this Rule is generally to be Observed: that the Vessel
with the matter in it to be fixed, ought always to be set over the fire
from time to time to be augmented, and this Incineration to be continued
still upon the Argent Vive sublimed, until the same is perfectly fixed
with the said Oyl or substance of Gold.
<p><b>XIII.</b> The which must be proved upon a Plate of Silver Red hot:
And if it be found fixed, let it have for the greater certainty, one Inceration
more of the said Oyl, which set under a strong fire for the space of three
days: then grind it with your Oyl upon the same Stone, till it be as thick
as an Ointment; which make perfectly dry with an easie fire, and then let
it be Calcined with a strong fire for the space of eight hours.
<p><b>XIV.</b> Which done, then Incinerate it, and dry it again with a
soft or gentle fire oftentimes, till it stands in the fire like melted
Wax. This medicine will transmute Silver substantially and perfectly into
fine and pure Alchymick Gold perfect to all the works of Goldsmiths but
not to Medicine for Men.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXVII</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Two Other Mineral Elixirs, or Two Other Processes
of Mercury</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> There be many other Noble and Profitable Secrets in this Art,
or Mystery of our Mineral Stone; viz. good Elixirs to be made out of Metalline
Bodies; of which a Mineral Elixirs, two are more excellent than the rest,
the first of which we shall handle in this Chapter.
<p>(Here comes the Process or Practical Operation of Mercury mentioned
Chap. 61 Sect. 13 aforegoing)
<p><b>II</b>. The first of these Elixirs is only in Mercury: The second,
in Mercury and the White Body for the White Elixir; and with the same to
the Red too, if you so please, being prudently pursued and sought after.
<p><b>III.</b> The first manner to Elixirate only with mercury is thus.
Dissolve Mercury only, by it self into a Milky water, with the which Mercury
so dissolved, you may dissolve so much more Mercury, and so continually,
as long as you please.
<p><b>IV.</b> Put this into a gentle Fire to be Distilled, so shall you
have Our Virgin’s Milk White and Crystalline, wherewith all Bodies may
be dissolved into their first Manner, Washed and Purged.
<p><b>V.</b> This water is of a Silver Color, which if you fix with its
Earthy Faeces calcined, and after that dissolved again in the quantity
of its remaining water, and then again Coagulated and Congealed (which
work is to be done upon a Stone), you will have at length the Elixir of
Argent Vive, which will transmute all Imperfect Bodies to a perfect Whiteness.
<p><b>VI.</b> And so of this Mercurial substance is made a water permanent
or fixt, wherewith the Calxes of all Bodies may be so depurated and Whitened,
as thereby to become the most pure and fine Silver.
<p><b>VII</b>. And therefore as I have said before in the beginning of
this work, when Mercury is dissolved, then are its Elements separable;
and after the separation of its Mercurial Liquor, and that a component
putrefaction is performed; after the same White Liquor, there will Distill
a Golden moisture or humour, to which if you add a small quantity of the
Ferment of the Gum of the aforesaid Elixirated White Stone, that then the
same White Stone, with the said Golden humour, shall be made the Red Stone,
which shall transmute Argent Vive, and all metalline Bodies into the finest
and most pure Gold.
<p><b>VIII.</b> Again, if you take the aforesaid Red humour of Mercury
and Dissolve in it a little of the aforesaid Red Ferment, being made as
aforesaid of the White Stone, and then with the same Red humour of Mercury,
so Fermented with its self, the Calxes of all Bodies, may be so depurated
and Citrinated, that thereby they become most pure Gold.
<p><b>IX.</b> When also Argent Vive is dissolved, then dissolve in it a
little of the aforesaid Red Ferment, and so put all into Kemia, or a proper
Vessel, which firmly close up with a Philosophic Seal. Then with a continual
and easie or gentle Fire, draw out the Chariot of the four Elements through
the Depth of the Sea, until (the Floods being dryed up) there appears in
the Matter a bright shining substance, like to the Eyes of the Fishes.
<p><b>X.</b> For by this Operation, if you keep your Temperate Fire continually
alive, the Floods shall dry up, with an exceeding drought, and the dry
Land or Earth shall appear, as in the days of Noah, the waters were dryed
up, and the dry Ground appeared in the midst of the Sea: for so says David,
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dryed up; he led them through the Depths
as through the Wilderness.
<p><b>XI.</b> And then by the Space of forty days following, it shall be
Rubified (as the Philosophers demonstrate) by the help of a Vehement Fire,
as the Nature of it requires, continuing and remaining in the same strong
Fire till it melt and flow like Wax, whereby it will be able to transmute
all Bodies into pure fine Gold.
<p><b>XII.</b> And thus the White and Red Medicines are multiplies with
their own proper humidities: viz. only by the solution of the White Medicines
in their own proper White and Red humours, and by their Coagulation again
of the same, as necessity requires. Thus we have explicated with singular
plainness of Speech, the Elixiration of mercury per se, or Argent Vive
alone.

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXVIII</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>The Second of the Former Elixirs, with Mercury and
the Body Alchymick</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> To Elixirate with Mercury and the Body Alchymick. Take one
part of the most pure Kibrick (quod est pater Mercurii et omnium Liquabilium),
Sea water 12 parts, in which dissolve the Kibrick: being dissolved, strain
the water through a Linen Cloth; and what remains undissolved, which will
not go through, put into the Vessel called Kemia, set it over a gentle
fire, as it were the heat of the Sun, until there appears on the Top a
Red Color.
<p><b>II.</b> Then put to it a quarter more of the Sea-water aforesaid,
being kept in a very clean Vessel, set it on a very gentle fire, and dry
it up again, as you did before, by little and little at a time.
<p><b>III.</b> For in this Work, by so much less there is put of the Spirit,
and more of the Body; for so much the sooner and better shall the Solution
be made; the which Solution is made by the Congelation of its water.
<p><b>IV.</b> And therefore as the Rosary saith, you must beware that the
Belly be not made over moist, for if it be, the water shall not receive
or attain to its dryness,
<p><b>V.</b> This manner of Imbibition must be observed and continued so
long, till the whole water by several Imbibitions shall be dryed up into
a Body.
<p><b>VI</b>. This done, let the Vessel be firmly and Philosophically Sealed
up, and placed in its proper Furnace, with a mean or gentle fire, which
must not wax cold, from the first hour you begin to set the same into the
Furnace, till you have made an end of the whole work.
<p><b>VII.</b> And when the matter is sublimed, then let it be made to
Descend by little and little without Violence, the fire being Artificially
made or set over it; which done, let it be again sublimed as before.
<p><b>VIII.</b> And so let the Soul of the Sun of the Vulgar (the which
is our unclean Oyntment, the Spirit not yet conjoined with the Body) Ascend
from the Earth to th4e Heaven; and again make it to Descend from Heaven
to the Earth, till all becomes Earth, which before was Heaven.
<p><b>IX.</b> To the end there may be made a substance, not so hard as
the Body, nor yet so soft as the Spirit; but holding a mean disposition,
standing fixed and Permanent in the fire, like a White piece of melted
Wax, flowing in the bottom of the Vessel.
<p><b>X.</b> The which White substance, of a mean or middle consistency,
must be fed and nourished with Milk and meat,till the quantity tereof be
increased according to your desire.
<p><b>XI.</b> This Medicine being Fermented to the Red, with a portion
of Sol Dissolved in the water of the Sea, by reason of separating the first;
the form from the Matter, to the end, that it may be in a more noble form
than it was before, when the first qualities did remain undivided; and
that it may be brought into a Purple Colour by the help of a strong and
continual fire: whereby is made the true Elixir, both for the White and
Red Work.
<p><b>XII.</b> Now this Elixir, be it White or Red, shall be increased
an hundred fold more, both in Virtue, and Goodness, if its Quintessence
be fixed with it, and that then afterwards it be brought and reduced by
the Fire of Nature into a thin Oyl, the which must be done in a Circulatory
Vessel: for truly, then the least drop thereof does Congeal a thousand
drops of Mercury into the very greatest Medicine.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXIX</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Of the Vegetable Stone</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> The Vegetable Stone is gotten by Virtue of the Fire of Nature,
of the Composition of which fire we now intend plainly to treat and of
the way how to work with it, in every respect.
<p><b>II.</b> Its Composition is of four things, as Raymundus saith, in
his <i>Book of Quintessences</i>: It is a Composition of Sal Amarum, which
is Ignis adeptus, a fire that is gotten without Wood or Coal, and by an
easie working, does work against all manner of sharpness of Action of the
Visible Fire, like as if it were the fire of Hell; and therefore, altho’
Wine be hot, yet this water of Mercury is hotter: for it is able to dissolve
all Bodies, to putrefie, and also to divide the Elements, which neither
common Fire nor Wine can do.
<p><b>III.</b> Some think that this Fire of Nature is extracted or drawn
from Wine, according to the common way, and that it must be rectified by
often Distillations, until its Phlegm is wholly abstracted, which hinders
its Heat, Virtue, Strength and Burning. But this, when it is done to all
advantages, and its highest perfection (which Fools call the pure Spirit)
and then put to the Calx of the Body ever so well prepared, yet will it
be weak and ineffectual to Our purpose, for Dissolution, Conservation,
etc.
<p><b>IV.</b> The true and Pure Spirit is our Silverish Spirit of Wine,
which is our Vegetable Mercury, and the true water of the Philosophers.
Concerning which, see in Ripley’s secret <i>Concord</i>.
<p><b>V.</b> Wherefore since the vulgar Spirit or Wine is such, it is evident
that there is an Error in choosing of this Principle: for the true Principle
(which is the beginning) is the Resolutive Menstruum (which is the Soul
of Mercury, and this Tincture is a very Oyl, separate from its foul Earth
and faint Water) which, as we know, and according to the traditions of
the Wise Philosophers, is an Unctuous moisture, which is the nearest Matter
of our Vegetable and Philosophic Mercury.
<p><b>VI.</b> The which Principle, Resolutive Menstruum, Near Matter, or
Unctuous Moisture, Raymundus (in Cap. 6 and Cap. 8 of his <i>Clavis</i>)
does call Black, Blacker than Black: The which Black thing or Matter I
certainly know.
<p><b>VII.</b> But since Raymundus saith, that this Resolutive Menstruum,
does come from Wine, or the Lees, or Tartar thereof, how is he to be understood?
Truly, he himself unfolds the Mystery: Our Water or Menstruum, is a Metalline
Water, generated of a Metalline Matter only: So that Raymundus speaks,
either of the Resolutive Menstruum or of the Resoluble Menstruum.
<p><b>VIII.</b> This Menstruum springs from a Silver Wine, which does Naturally
make a dissolution of its own Sulphur. It is apparent in the 11 Cap. of
Raymundus, that Our Mercurial and Radical moisture is not only Congealed
into perfect Metal, by Vapour of its hot and dry Sulphur, but that also
the same Metalline Water, being so terminated in the form of a Metal, after
its Resolution in Ashes has power naturally of a Menstruum to dissolve
Our Stone or Sulphur, and change it to its Vegetable Nature, without prejudice
or hurt to its own Nature.
<p><b>IX.</b> Wherefore he says, that from whatsoever any thing does spring
or grow by Nature, that into the same it may again be resolved.
<p><b>X.</b> If he (viz. Raymundus) speaks of the first water or Resolutive
Menstruum; you are to understand that it is (so as he speaks) not a Metalline
Water, but after a certain manner: for this water of the Resolutive Menstruum,
is both a Sulphurous and a Mercurial Vapour Ignis and Azoth) and by reason
of its Sulphurity, it burns with the fire.
<p><b>XI.</b> This Resolutive Menstruum is our Vegetative Mercury, which
is our Vaporous Menstruum, and every burning water of Life, Aqua Vitae
ardens, by whose attractive Virtue, the Body of the Volatile Spirit, being
fixed by the fire against Nature, is dissolved naturally into the water
of Philosophers, and exalted and lifted up from its Salt and Combustible
Dregs into a clear Mercurial and Natural substance, which must be Fermented
with the Oyl of Sol and Luna, and then is made thereof the great Elixir;
with which Mercurial substance we also counterfeit Pearls and Pretious
Stones.
<p><b>XII.</b> We see also, that in Tartar dryed only in the Sun, there
are certain Mercurial Qualities shining and giving of Light to the Eye,
but the kind of Metals is a Composition of Sulphur and Argent Vive. And
therefore, if he means after this sort, then the Resolutive Menstruum,
may be taken for a Metalline water; for otherwise it is not Answered.
<p><b>XIII.</b> Again, Raymundus proves clearly to the contrary, where
he answers him who demanded of him; in what is the Vegetable Mercury, in
Gold or in Silver? It is (saith he) a simple Coessential substance, the
which is brought from its own Concrete parts and proper Veins, to such
a pass or point by the Dissolutive Menstruum, that by Virtue of the simple
and Co-essential substance, they are able to multiply their similitudes
in Mercuries, which have none in themselves, and are also apt Medicines
for Mens Bodies, and to expel and put away from them many Diseases, and
to restore to the Old and Aged, their former Youth, and preserve them in
Health so long a time as God has designed them to Live.
<p><b>XIV.</b> This Coessential substance is Our White and Red Tincture
by whom these Earths that are wanting, are multiplied in Tincture, whereby
they are made Elixirs, to purge Metals, and a Medicine for Man’s Body.
<p><b>XV.</b> Therefore, Our true Metalline Water is an Unctuous humidity
of the Body dissolved to the similitude of Black Pitch, Liquid and Melted;
and this Unctuous and Black humidity is called the true Resoluble Menstruum
is drawn.
<p><b>XVI</b>. Our Metalline Water is separated from the Body of Lunaria,
which is its terminated and Radical humidity in the kind and Color of White
shining Silver, and its Body, is our black Sulphur: Therefore see Chap.
63 in the <i>Lunary Branch</i>, and in his <i>Clavis</i> where you will
find the Radical humidity to be the true Menstruum wherewith the solemn
dissolution of its own black Body is made.
<p><b>XVII.</b> Raymundus doth say, that an Unctuous Humidity is the last
comfort and support to the Humane Body, which what it is, is manifest to
the Philosophers; it makes a noise or sound in the Vessel, and is Distilled
with a great deal of Art. He also saith, that Our Stone is made of the
hottest Matter or substance in Nature: And I say that Wine is hot; but
there is another thing which is much hotter than Wine, whose substance,
by reason of its exceeding Airyness or Spirituosity is most quickly inflamed
by the Fore.
<p><b>XVIII.</b> And the Lees, or Tartar, and Dregs of this Unctuous humidity,
is gross, like the Rind or Bark of a Tree: and the same Tartar is blacker
than the Tartar of the Black Grape of Catalonia, for which cause it is
called by Raymundus, a Black, more Black than Black. By these Lees, or
Tartar and Dregs, is meant the Lees of our Silver Wine, separated from
the Lunary Body.
<p><b>XIX.</b> And because that this humidity is Unctuous, therefore it
better agrees with the Unctuosity of Metals, than the Spirit drawn from
Common Wine; for through its Liquefactive Virtue, Metals do melt, and are
made flowing and moist in the Fire; the which Operation truly the Spirit
of Common Wine cannot do.
<p><b>XX.</b> For the Spirit of Wine, how strong soever it be, is (comparatively)
but clean Phlegm or Water: whereas contrariwise, in Our Unctuous Distilled
Spirit, there is no waterishness at all. But this thing being rare in our
Parts, as well in other Countries, Guido Montanor found out another Unctuosity
humidity, which swims upon other Liquors, which humidity proceeds from
Wine, which Raymundus, and Arnoldus knew, with some others, but they taught
not how it should be obtained.
<p><b>XXI.</b> Our Tincture in Distilling, is separated both from the Phlegm
and its gross Faeces, till it be like an Oyl, and that is the Soul of Mercury,
which is Air and Fire, separate from its two extremes; and so it being
an Unctuous moisture, is the mean, See the first and last chapter of Raymundus’
Codicil.
<p><b>XXII.</b> Notwithstanding, Raymundus saith, it must be drawn from
Death, and from the Faeces of Wine by rectification, that it may be actuated
in Distillation by hot Vegetable substances, thereunto appertaining, as
Pepper, Euphorbium, etc., for without these things he saith, the Virtue
thereof is not sufficient, but by long time to dissolve Metals.
<p><b>XXIII.</b> Raymundus saith in the end of his natural Magick, that
there is a Salt made of the Lees or Tartar of Wine, or Aqua Vitae, called
the Salt of Art and Mercury, without which Salt (saith he) there is nothing
can be done: Also he beings his Practice with this Salt in the first and
last Chapter of his Codicil.
<p><b>XXIV.</b> Wherefore as the same Philosopher affirms, among these
things is this Menstruum one of the Secrets of this Art, whose Virtue must
be increased by a wise management of the Matter: you must circulate this
Menstruum in the Unctuous humidity in a Vessel of Circulation, by rotation
continually, an hundred and twenty days, in the hottest Furnace.

<br><b><font size=+1>The Remaining Process of the Vegetable Stone</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> Hitherto the Process of the Vegetable Stone has been long
and Obscure; but that nothing may be doubtful to the prejudice of my professed
Love to your Lordship, I say that all these things spoken by Raymundus
are covered with the Mantle of Philosophy. Truly his intention is, that
there should be made a dissolution with the Spirit of Wine, but that this
Spirit of Wine should be joined with another Menstruum resoluble, without
which Resolution can never be attained.
<p><b>II.</b> Here the two Spirits are joined together, the Vegetable Menstruum
or White Oyl of Tartar, and our Metalline Oyl.
<p><b>III.</b> And that Menstruum Resoluble is generated only of a Metalline
kind: for it is a potential or mighty Vapour. Being in every Metalline
Body, joining together two extremes, Sulphur and Argent Vive.
<p><b>IV.</b> And so indeed after this sort, Our water is a Metalline water,
which because it does favor of the Nature of either extreme, it therefore
brings our Resolutive Menstruum into Act.
<p><b>V.</b> Now how this Menstruum, which is Unctuous, Moist, Sulphurous,
and mercurial, agreeing with the Nature of Metals, and wherewith Bodies
must be Artificially dissolved, may be had, we will here shew by clear
practice.
<p><b>VI</b>. Take the sharpest humidity of Grapes, and in it being Distilled,
dissolve the Body, well Calcined into a Redness, into Crystalline clear
and Ponderous Water, the which Body Calcined into Redness, is of the masters
of this Science called Sericon.
<p><b>VII</b>. Now comes in the Practice of Pupilla, of the dissolution
of the Red Lyon, for the fire of nature, called also Red Lead, Red Coral,
Sericon is of the Nature of Black Pepper, Euphorbium, etc., of a hot biting
and fiery nature, all which things are spoken only by way of Comparison.
<p><b>VIII.</b> Then of this Crystalline water, let there be made a Gum,
the which in Taste will be like to Alum. This Gum by Raymundus is called
Vitriol Azoth, from which let there be drawn with a gentle Fire, first
a weak water, with no more Taste or sharpness than simple Well water (Fresher
water there is none in Taste, yet will it never Consume or Waste, though
it be used never so often; not will it be every less in quantity.
<p><b>IX.</b> And when the White Fume shall begin to appear, change your
Receiver, and Lute it strongly, that it breath not forth; so shall you
have our burning water, Our Aqua Vitae, and Resolutive Menstruum (the which
before was Resoluble) a Vapour potential, a mighty Vapour, able to dissolve
Bodies, to Putrifie, and to Purifie, to divide the Elements, and also to
exalt the Earth into a wonderful Salt, by the force of its attractive Virtue.
This is our Fire of Nature.
<p><b>X.</b> This water has a bitter sharp Taste upon the Tongue, and also
a kind of stinking Menstruum: and because it is a water which is very Spirituous
and Volatile, therefore within a Month after it is Distilled, it ought
to be put upon its Calx. When it is affused upon the Calx, it will without
any external Fire, boil if the Vessel be closely shut; and it will not
cease to Ferment or work, till it be all dryed up into the Calx.
<p><b>XI.</b> Therefore you must put no greater a quantity of it to the
Calx, but what may just cover it as it were and so proceed (When the Furnace
is dryed up), to the whole Complement thereof (as in the Operation of the
Compound water), and as the work requires.
<p><b>XII.</b> And when the Elixir shall be brought into a Purple Color,
then let it be dissolved with the aforesaid Vegetable Menstruum into a
thin Oyl, the same Menstruum being first rectified, and let the same by
the Circulation of the Spirit of our water be fixed; so will it have Power
to transmute or change all Bodies into pure Gold, and to heal and Cure
all Infirmities and Diseases in man’s Body, ten thousand times better than
all the Potions and Prescriptions of Galen or Hippocrates.
<p><b>XIII.</b> This Elixir is the true Aurum Potabile, and no other; for
it is made of Gold Elementated and Circulated by the spirituous wheel of
Philosophy; and it is so wrought with the Air, Gas, potency, or spirit
of Mercury dissolved by itself, sublimed and rectified, as that the body
of Gold by it may not only be curiously and exquisitely Elixirated; but
also that it may then afterwards be brought to such a perfection by this
our Art, as to be applied profitably to the most desirable work.
<p><b>XIV.</b> Thus you may see, we have hid nothing concerning this our
desired Elixir of the Vegetable Stone: I shall now proceed to that of the
Animal Stone, which is but a work of three days; and in three days will
be completely ended. My advice to you is, not to gather the Leaves of Words;
but the Fruits of Works, the profit of the things fought after.
<p><b>XV.</b> And know that in this Work, I have not so much affected the
Curiosity of Language, or Elegancies of Style, as the denudating the Essential
Verity, and exposing the very Power of Truth to your View, which by reason
of my haste I have now concisely done in few words.

<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXXI</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Of the Animal Stone</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> We now come to reveal the most noble and High Secret of Secrets,
viz. the Mystery of our Animal Stone desired of all Mankind, and the way
and manner of its Elixiration. But this Animal Elixir is neither from Wine,
as it is Wine, nor from Eggs, Hair or Blood, as they are such things, but
only from the Elements: And these Elements we ought to search out, in the
Excellency of their exceeding Simplicity and Rectification.
<p><b>II.</b> The Elements as Roger Bacon saith, are the Roots of all things,
the Mothers of every thing: yet the Elements of the said things do not
enter into the Work of this Our Elixir; but only by the Virtue and Commixtion
of those Elements, with the Elements of Spirits, and Bodies of Metals.
<p><b>III.</b> Yet so indeed as Roger Bacon saith, the Elements of those
things aforesaid do so enter in as to pierce through (though not to dwell
there) and to Accomplish this Our great Elixir.
<p><b>IV.</b> Notwithstanding among all those things which be natural (as
all the rest be, which Philosophers have taken), there is one thing yet,
which is found more pretious, more excellent, more proper, and more Natural
than all the rest, for this our purpose.
<p><b>V.</b> The which one thing, because it is more excellent than all
the rest, the Philosophers have taken for the nearest; because of the singular
perfection which God had given to the Microcosm or lesser World, in whom
are not only the Ideas of the Courses and effects of the Planets, Stars,
and Asterisms, but also the Complexions, humours, Spirits, and Natural
Virtues of the Elements.
<p><b>VI.</b> And therefore consider the most noble Bird of Hermes, which
when the Sun is in Aries, begins to fly; and as it is advised, so let it
be brought forth and sought for. Seek out the true Sulphur from his Mine
or Minera, not being corrupted, for the whole perfection lies in the uncorrupt
Sulphur.
<p><b>VII.</b> This is our Stone, the which as Aristotle saith, in his
Secret of Secrets, is generated in the Dunghill, Highways, and must be
divided into four parts: because saith he, each part has one Nature, the
which parts must be joined together again, till they resist or strive no
more; when they are joined unto it, it shall be White; if Fire, Red; as
you please.
<p><b>VIII.</b> But understand, that this Division, must not be a Manual
Division (but in Power and Effect), wherefore, let this one thing which
all Men have (its over-flowing Phlegmatic property being somewhat Evacuated)
be put into Kemia or proper Vessels, which Seal up Philosophically; let
it purify in a moist Fire a long Season, into a black thickness.
<p><b>IX.</b> Then by the second Degree of Fire, let it be Coagulated into
a dryness, after may Bubblings which it will make, wherein shall shine
innumerable Colors: and when all that which is fine and subtil, shall Ascend
upwards (or Sublime) in the Vessel most White, like as the Eyes of Fishes,
the work is compleat in the first part.
<p><b>X.</b> This truly is a marvelous thing, more to be wondered at, than
any Miracle of Nature, for then the self same White, has fully the Nature
of White Sulphur, not Burning (or Silver) and is the very Sulphur of Nature
and Argent Vive.
<p><b>XI.</b> Let some quantity of Luna be added to it in the manner of
an Amalgam; then it brings forth, by Operation, or generation of White
into White; and the same thing worketh it into Red, and is made compleat
into Red, by a greater Digestion in the Fire.
<p><b>XII.</b> Then, as the Philosophers advise, let the two Sulphurs,
viz. the White and the Red be mingled with the Oyl of the White Elixir,
that they may work the more strongly; upon which, if the Quintessence of
the Vegetable Stone shall be fixed, you shall have the highest Medicine
in the World, both to Heal and Cure Human Bodies, and to transmute the
Bodies of Metals into the most pure and fine Gold and Silver.

<p><b>I.</b> And now we are drawing near to the end of this work, we shall
hereunto add and Explicate one Secret, even our reserved Secret, hitherto
Buried in the Abyss of Aenigma’s and deep Silence.
<p><b>II.</b> We say that the Body of the Volatile Spirit, fixed, by Fire
against Nature, ought to be dissolved in the Vegetable Water, that is to
say, in our Vaporous Menstruum; not in water of the Cloud, but in water
of the Philosophers.
<p><b>III.</b> In which Dissolution, the Body is made light, for its more
pure and subtil part is lifted up (or Sublimed) from Salt and Combustible
Faeces, by Virtue of the water attractive: which is more clear than the
water of the Margarite, as I have seen.
<p><b>IV.</b> And of this substance Fermented with the Oyl of Luna or Sol,
is made the great Elixir, for the transmutation of imperfect Bodies.
<p><b>V.</b> It must oftentimes be dissolved and Coagulated with its Ferment,
that it may work the better; and with this said Mercurial substance, thus
Elevated (or sublimed) we Counterfeit the most pretious Margarites or Pearls,
not inferior to the sight, to the very best that ever Nature produced.
<p><b>VI.</b> And with these Artificial pretious Stones, we shall finish

abscondite Mysteries of which, being by the Wise and upright Sons of Art

virtue of thy Grace, help forward my desires, and enable me I beseech thee
to perform they Holy Will.
<p><b>XII.</b> O most excellent Fountain, boundless in Treasures, thou
scatterest thy good things without measure amongst the Sons of Men, and

<p><b>XIII.</b> Thou are worthy O Lord, to behold the Works of thy Hand
and to defend what thy Right Hand has planted, that we may not live unprofitably,
nor spend the course of our Years in Vanities.

falsehood and deceit, that avoiding the Great danger of a sinful course

<p><b><font size=+1>Chapter LXXIII</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Ripley’s Philosophical Axioms Out of the Theatrum
Chymicum.</font></b></center>

<p><b>I.</b> Our Stone is called the microcosm; One and Three; Magnesia
and Sulphur and Mercury, all proportioned by Nature her self. Now understand
that there are three Mercuries, which being the Key of the while Science,
Raymundus calls his Menstruums, without which, nothing is to be done in
this Art: but the Essential Mercury of the Bodies is the chief material
of our Stone.
<p><b>II</b>. Our Stone is a Soul and a substance, by which the Earth does
receive its splendor: what other thing is Sol or Luna than a Terra Munda,
a pure Earth, Red and White? The whole Composition we call Our Plumbum
or Lead, the Quality of whose splendor proceeds from Sol and Luna.
<p><b>III.</b> No impure Body, one excepted, which the Philosophers vulgarly
call the Green Lyon (which is the medium which Conjoyns the Tinctures between
Sol and Luna with perfection), does Enter into our magistery.
<p><b>IV.</b> These Menstruums you ought to know, without which no true
Calcination, or natural dissolution can possibly be done. But our principal
Menstruum may be said indeed to be Invisible or Spiritual; yet by the help
of our Aqua Philosophica Secunda, through a separation of the Elements,
in the form of clear water, it is brought to light, and made to appear.
<p><b>V.</b> And by this Menstruum with great Labour is made the Sulphur
of nature, by Circulation in a pure Spirit; and with the same you may dissolve
your Body after divers manners: and an Oyl may be extracted therefrom,
of a Golden Color, like as from Our Red Lead.
<p><b>VI.</b> <i>1. De Calcinatione</i>: Calcination is the Purgation of
our Stone, restoring it to its own Natural Color, inducing first a necessary
dissolution thereof, but neither with Corrosives, nor fire alone, nor A.F.
now with other Burning waters, or the Vapour of Lead, is our Stone Calcined;
for by such Calcination, Bodies are destroyed, for that they diminish their
humidities.
<p><b>VII.</b> Whereas in our Calcination the Radical humidity is Augmented
or multiplied, for like increases like, he which knows not this knows nothing
in this Art. Joyn like with like, the kind with kind, as you ought; every
seed and rejoices in seed of its own kind: and every Spirit is fixed with
a Calx of its own king or Nature.
<p><b>VIII.</b> The Philosophers make an Unctuous Calx, both White and
Red, of three Degrees, before it can be perfected, that shall melt as Wax,
till which it is of no use. If your water shall be in a right or just proportion
with your Earth, and a fit Heat, your Matter will Germinate, the White
together with the Red, which will endure in a perpetual Fire.
<p><b>IX.</b> Make a trinity of Unity, without dissention; this is the
most certain and best proportion: and by how much the lesser part is the
more spiritual, by so much the more easily will the dissolution be performed:
drown not the Earth with too much water, lest you destroy the whole Work.
<p><b>X.</b> <i>2. De Dissolutione</i>: Seek not that in a thing which
is not in it, as in Eggs, Blood, Wine, Vitriol, and the other middle Minerals;
there is no profit to be had in things not Metallick: In Metals, from Metals,
and by or through Metals, Metals are made perfect.
<p><b>XI.</b> First make a Rotation of all Elements; and before all things,
convert the Earth into water by dissolution: Then Dissolve that Water into
Air, and then make that Air into Fire: this done, reduce it again into
Earth, for otherwise you labour in vain.
<p><b>XII.</b> Here is nothing besides the Sister and the Brother; that
is, the Agent and the Patient, Sulphur and Mercury, which are generated
Co-essential substances. The dissolution of one part of the Corporeal Substance,
causeth a Congelation of another part of the Spiritual.
<p><b>XIII.</b> Every Metal was once a Mineral Water, wherefore they may
all be dissolved into Water again; in which Water are the four repugnant
Qualities with diversity. In one Glass all things ought to be done, made
in the form of an Egg, and well closed.
<p><b>XIV.</b> Let not your Glass be hotter than you can endure your naked
Hand upon, so long as your matter is in dissolution: When the Body is altered
from its first form, it immediately puts on a new form.
<p><b>XV.</b><i> 3. De Dispositione</i>: Beware that you open not your
Glass, nor ever move it, from the beginning of the work to the end thereof;
for then you will never bring your work to perfection. Dry the Earth till
it becomes thirsty in Calcination, otherwise your Act in vain. Divide the
matter into two parts, that you may separate the subtil from the gross,
or thin from the thick, till the Earth remains in the bottom of a Livid
Color.
<p><b>XVI.</b> One part is Spiritual and Volatile; but they ought all to
be converted tone matter or substance. And distill the Water, with which
you would Vivify the Stone till it be pure and thin as water, shining with
a Blue Livid Color, retaining its Figure and Ponderosity: with this Water
Hermes moistens or waters his Tree, whilst in his Glass, and makes the
Flowers to increase on high.
<p><b>XVII.</b> First divide that, which Nature first tyed together, converting
the Essential Mercury into Air, or a Vapour, without which natural and
subtil separation, no future Generation can be completed.
<p><b>XVIII.</b> Your Water ought to be seven times sublimed, otherwise
there can never be any natural Dissolution made; nor shall you see any
Putrefaction like Liquid Pitch; nor will the Colors appear, because of
the defect of the Fire Operating in your Glass.
<p><b>XIX.</b><i> 4. De Ignibus</i>: There are four kinds of Fires which
you ought to know; the Natural, the Unnatural, that contrary to Nature,
and the Elemental, which burns Wood: These are the fires we use, and no
others.
<p><b>XX.</b> The Fire of Nature is in every thing, and is the third Menstruum.
The Innatural Fire is occasionally so called, and it is the Fire of Ashes,
of Sand, and baths for putrefying: and without this no Putrefaction can
be done.
<p><b>XXI.</b> The Fire against Nature, is that which tears Bodies to pieces
or Atoms; which is the fiery Dragon, violently burning like the fire of
Hell. Make therefore that your fire within, in your Glass, which will burn
the Bodies much more powerfully than the vulgar Elemental fire can do.
<p><b>XXII.</b><i> 5. De Conjunctione</i>: Conjunction is the joining together
of things separated, and of differing Qualities; or the Adequation or bringing
to an equality of principles: he which knows not how to separate the Elements,
and to divide them, and then to conjoin them again, errs, not knowing the
true way.
<p><b>XXIII</b>. Divide the Soul from the Body, and get that, for it is
the Soul which causes the perpetual Conjunction: the Male, which is his
Sister, nine parts; then like rejoices with like for ever.
<p><b>XXIV.</b> Certainly Dissolution and Conjunction, are two strong principles
of this Science, though there may be many other principles besides.
<p><b>XXV.</b> <i>6. De Putrefactione</i>: The Destruction of the Bodies
is such, that you are diligently to Conserve them in a Bath, or our Horse-Dung,
viz. in a moist heat for ninety days in Natural: but the Putrefaction is
not completely Absolved, and brought to whiteness, like the Eyes of Fishes,
in less than 150 days; the blackness first appearing, is the Index or Sign,
that the matter draws on to Putrefaction.
<p><b>XXVI.</b> Being together Black like Liquid Pitch, in the same time,
they swell and cause an Ebullition, with Colors like those of the Rainbow,
of a most beautiful aspect; and then the water begins to whiten the whole
mass.
<p><b>XXVII.</b> A temperate heat working in moist Bodies, brings forth
blackness, which having obtained, there is nothing that you need fear,
for in the same way, the Germination of our Stone does follow, and forthwith,
to wit, in the space of thirty (or forty) days, or Adrop, which is our
Uzifer or Cinnabar, and our Red Lead.
<p><b>XXVIII.</b> Take heed to defend your Glass from a Violent Heat, and
a sudden Cold; make use of a moderate Fire, and beware of Vitrification.
Beware how you bind up your matter; mix it not with Salts, Sulphurs, not
the middle Minerals; let Sophisters prate what they will, Our Sulphur and
our Mercury are found in Metals only.
<p><b>XXIX.</b> <i>7. De Congelatione</i>: Coagulation or Congelation is
the induration or hardening of things, in Calore Candido, and the fixing
of the Volatile Spirit. The Elements are forthwith converted, but the Congelation
is no way impeded, for those things which are Congealed in the Air, melt
or soften not in the Water; for if so, Our work would be destroyed, and
come to nothing.
<p><b>XXX.</b> When the Composition is brought is brought to Whiteness,
then the Spirit is United and Congealed with the Body; but it will be a
good length of time before such a Congelation will appear in the likeness
or Beauty of Pearls. The cause of all these things is the most temperate
heat, continually working and moving the matter. Believe me also, that
your whole Labour is lost, except you revivify your Earth with the Water,
without that you shall never see a true Congelation.
<p><b>XXXI.</b> This Water is a Secret drawn from the Life of all things
existing in Nature; for from Water all things in the World have their first
beginning, as you may easily perceive in many tings. The substance or Matter
is nourished with its proper menstruum, which the Water and the Earth only
produce, whose proper Color is Greenness.
<p><b>XXXII.</b> Understand also that our fiery Water thus actuated is
called the menstrual Water, in which Our Earth is dissolved, and naturally
Calcined by Congelation; when you have made seven Imbibitions, then by
a Circumvolution, putrefy again all the Matter without addition, beholding
in the first place the blackness, then the Whiteness of the Congealed Matters.
<p><b>XXXIII.</b> Thus your Water is divided into two parts: with the first
part, the Bodies are purifed: the second part is reserved for Imbibitions;
with which afterwards the Matter is made black, and presently after with
a gently fire, made White, then reduce to Redness.
<p><b>XXXIV.</b> <i>8. De Cibatione</i>: Cibation is the Feeding or Nourishing
of our dry Matter with Milk and Meat, being both administered moderately,
till it is reduced to the third Order: you must never give so much as to
cause a suffocation, or that the Aqueous humour should exceed the Blood:
if it drinks too much, the work will be hurt.
<p><b>XXXV.</b> Three times must you turn about the Philosophick Wheel,
observing the Rule of the said Cibation, and then in a little time it will
feel the Fire, so as to melt presently like Wax.
<p><b>XXXVI.</b> <i>9. De Sublimatione</i>: Sublime not the matter to the
top of the Vessel, for without Violence, you cannot bring it down to the
bottom again; by a temperate heat below, in the space of 40 days, it will
become black and obscure. When the Bodies are purified, let them be sublimed
by degrees more and more, till they shall be all elevated or converted
into Water.
<p><b>XXXVII.</b> We use Sublimation for three Causes. First, that the
Body may be made spiritual. Secondly, that the Spirit may be made Corporeal
and fixed with it, and become Consubstantial with it. Thirdly, that it
may be purified from its Original Impurities; and its Sulphurous Salt may
be diminished, with which it is infected; subliming it to the Top, as White
as Snow.
<p><b>XXXVIII.</b> <i>10. De Fermentatione</i>: Fermentations are made
after divers manners, by which our Medicine is perpetuated. Some dissolve
Sol and Luna into a certain clear Water; and with the Medicine of them,
they make the same to Coagulate, or be Coagulated, but such a Fermentation
we propose not.
<p><b>XXXIX.</b> This only is our Intention, that first you must Break,
or Tear, or Grind the matter to Atoms, before you Ferment it: Mix them
presently your Water and Earth together; and when the Medicine shall flow
like Wax, then see the above mentioned Amalgamation and put forth the same,
and when all that is mixed together, above or on the top of the Glass (being
well closed), make a Fire, till the whole be Fluxed; then make projection
as you shall think fit, because it is a Medicine wholly perfect: thus have
you made the Ferment both for the Red and the White.
<p><b>XL.</b> The true Fermentation is the Incorporation of the Soul with
the Body, restoring to the same the Natural Odour, Consistency, and Colour,
by a Natural Inspissation of the separated things. And as the magnet draws
Iron to its self, so our Earth by Nature draws down its Soul to itself,
Elevated with Wind: For without doubt, the Earth is the Ferment of the
Water, and by Course or Turns, the Water is the Ferment of the Earth.
<p><b>XLI.</b> We make the Water most Odoriferous, with which we reduce
all the Bodies into Oyl, with which Oyl we make our Medicine flow. We call
this Water a Quintessence, or the Powers, and it Heals or Cures all humane
Diseases. Make therefore this Oyl of Sol and Luna, which is a Ferment most
fragrant in smell.
<p><b>XLII.</b> <i>11. De Exaltatione</i>: Exaltation differs a little
from Sublimation, if you understand aright the words of the Philosophers.
If therefore you would Exalt your Bodies, sublime them first with Spiritus
Vitae; then let the Earth be subtiliated by a Natural rectification of
all Elements; so shall it be more pretious than Gold, because of the Quintessence
or Powers which they contain.
<p><b>XLIII.</b> When the Cold does overcome the Heat, then the Air is
converted into water, and so contraries are made by the way, till they
kindly conjoin and rest together: after this manner you must work them,
that they may be Circulated, that they (one with another) may speedily
be Exalted together in one Glass well Sealed, all this Operation is to
be done, and not with hands.
<p><b>XLIV.</b> Convert the Water into Earth, which will quickly be the
Nest of the other Elements; for the Earth is in the Fire, which rests in
the Air. Begin this Circulation in the West, then continue it till past
the Meridian, so will they be exalted.
<p><b>XLV.</b> <i>12. De Multiplcatione</i>: Multiplication is the thing
which makes the augmentation of the Medicine in Color, Smell, Virtue, and
Quantity; for it is a Fire, which being Excited, never dies, but always
dwells with you, one spark of which is able to make more Fire by the Virtue
of Multiplication.
<p><b>XLVI.</b> He is rich which has but one Particle or Grain of this
our Elixir, because that Grain is possible to be augmented (by one way)
to Infinity: If you dissolve this our dry Powder, and make a frequent Coagulation
thereof, you will augment it, and so you may Multiply it, till it increases
in your Glass, into the form of a Tree, and which Hermes calls a Tree,
most Beautiful in Aspect. Of which one Grain may be Multiplied to an hundred,
if you know how wisely to make your Projection.
<p><b>XLVII.</b> Our Elixir, the more fine and subtle it is made, so much
the more completely it tinges, and disperses its Tincture. Let your Fire
be kept equally close, Evening and Morning; so much the longer you keep
the Fire, so much the more profitable it will be; and Multiply more and
more in your Glass, nourishing your Mercury in its enclosure, whereby you
will have a greater Treasure than you could desire.
<p><b>XLVIII.</b> <i>13. De Projectione</i>: If your Tincture be true and,
not Variable, you may prove it in a small quantity thereof, either in metal
or mercury: It cleaves thereto as Pitch, and so Tinges in Projection, that
it is able to endure the strongest Fire: But many through Ignorance destroy
their work, by making Projection upon an impure Metal.
<p><b>XLIX.</b> See that you Project your Medicine upon your Ferment, so
will that Ferment be Brittle as Glass: Project that Brittle Medicine upon
pre Bodies, so have you Silver or Gold, enduring the severest Test.
<p><b>L.</b> Give not liberty to the Reins lest you sin, but Religiously
Fear and serve the Lord your God; think you self always before the Tribunal
of the most high, the great Judge and Rewarder of Mankind, who will return
to every Man according to his works.
<p><b>LI.</b> <i>14. Recapitulio</i>: Take heed diligently to the Latitude
of our Stone, and begin in the Occident, where the Sun sets, where the
Red Man and White Wife are made one, conjoined and Married by the Spirit
of Life, that they may live in Love and Quietness.
<p><b>LII.</b> The Earth and Water, are hoyed in a fit proportion; one
part of Earth or Body to three of Spirit, which is 4 to12 and is a good
proportion: you must take three parts of the Female to one of the Male:
by how much less there shall be of the Spirit in this Dispensation, Conjunction,
or Marriage, by so much the sooner will the Calcination be absolved.
<p><b>LIII.</b> The Calcination performed, then you must dissolve the Bodies,
divide, and Putrefy them; and all the Secrets of our other lower Stars
will have a perfect Coherence and understanding with the Poles of our Heaven,
and will appear with inexplicable Colors of Light and Glory, Transcending
in Luster and Beauty, all other things in the World, and all this before
the perfect Whiteness.
<p><b>LIV.</b> And after the perfect Whiteness, you will have a Yellow,
the false Citron Color: afterwards the Blood Red, unchangeable forever,
will be manifest; so have you a Medicine of the third Order in its kind,
which may continually be Multiplied. But this you must not in the least
be Ignorant of, that the Red Man does not tinge, nor yet his White Wife,
till they themselves are first Tinged with our Tincture or Stone.
<p><b>LV.</b> When therefore you prepare your Matter by this our Art; hide
your Bodies all over, and lay open their Profundities
<p><b>LVI.</b> The Red Elixir must be divided into two parts, before it
be Rubified, which put into two Glasses; and if you would have a double
Elixir, one of Sol and another of Luna, do thus:
<p><b>LVII.</b> With Mercury multiply presently the Medicine into a great
quantity, if you have at first only so small a quantity as a Spoonful:
then may you multiply them together into a White and Red Medicine, which
by Circulation you must convert into a perfect Oyl according to our directions;
and this multiplication from your first small quantity may be continued,
should you live a thousand Years. These Oyls will fix Crude Mercury into
perfect Sol and Luna.
<p><b>LVIII.</b> This pure and fixed Oleaginous substance, Raymundus calls
his basilisk, whose Explication is so easie to be understood, that it needs
no more Words.
<p><b>LIX.</b> For our Metals are nothing else, than our two Minerae, viz.
those of Sol and Luna, as Raymundus wisely Notes: The Splendor of Luna,
and the Light of shining Sol. In these two Minerae, the Secret dwells;
though the Splendor may for a while be hid from your Eyes, which by the
help of Art, you may easily being to light.
<p><b>XL.</b> This hidden Stone, this one thing, purifie it, wash it in
its own Liquor Water or Blood, till it grows White; then prudently Ferment
it, so have you the Sum and Perfection of the whole World.
