  <p>Noble Sir: </p>
  <p>My honourable Patron and my good Friend, my humble service in the
first
place presented to you: At you earnest request I cannot but accomplish
your desires, seeing you have a great love and affection, by experience
to find out the Secrets of Nature, which at this time are known to few,
and even wholly hid in darkness. Although many of the Ancients have
written
thereof, and their books dispersed, yet are they written in a Magick
stile,
and profitable to none but those who from their youth have been trained
up in this Magick, or instructed by God in such Secrets. Therefore,
these
Secrets for which you humble yourself are in a deep pit, strongly
locked
up, so that no man can open unless he have received the Key from the
Spirit
of Truth. Of the Magical Antimony or of that Antimony of the Ancients
will
I speak no thing in this treatise, seeing that men will know nothing of
it; but what they read of it they apply only to common Antimony; of the
which you only desire a treatise which I will freely communicate to you
and will write, (1) What it is, (2) Of what parts it is composed, (3)
Into
what it may be resolved again. </p>
  <p>And you shall in this treatise understand me no otherwise then
according
to the Letter; for I will use here no Metaphors, Allegories, or
Similitudes;
only I will describe Antimony with a plain stile, that you may not be
deceived,
though you prepare it according to the Letter, and ye shall obtain that
of which I write; by these, you may also judge whether in common
Antimony
that secret, or Chymical and Physical Mystery be or not, of the which
Paracelsus
and the Magicians have written. </p>
  <p>Now Antimony as it cometh out of the Mountains, is not pure as it
should
be; for it is mingled with stones of the mine. I never saw any that
came
forth pure from the Mountains; therefore ere one use it, it must be
purified,
which purification is done by digestion; but this digestion is a
Sulphureous
Fire. The best Sulphur is a Sulphur Metalline, and though Artists do
purifie
it with vegetable fire, that is with Tartar, yet is this digestion not
natural, But that the Tartar divides the Regulus from its Faeces this
is
the cause that the Sulphur of Antimony, Salt is more Vegetable than
Metalline,
but you shall purify it with Sulphur that is sprung from Mercury, and
not
from Salts; for this metalline Sulphur will be reduced in the Argent
vive
of Antimony into Argent vive, and lastly out of this Argent vive of
Antimony
will be pure gold be made. Now this Metalline Sulphur that purifieth
Antimony
is only in Mars and no where else, and this purification is done thus:
Rx Mars of Iron 4 parts (I am wont to take pieces of nails which are
neither
gross nor thick) put them into a strong crucible, and set them in a
wind
Furnace. Let it stand so long till you see the nails or Iron are soft,
then put into the Crucible 8 parts of Antimony, make a strong fire that
the Mars may flow well in the Antimony, then cast into the crucible
with
an Iron Ladle, a good handful of Saltpeter; then let them boil up
together
in the Crucible (let the Crucible therefore be considerably great, that
it boil not out) and let it stand still till all be quiet and flowing,
then cast it forth into a casting pot so the Regulus settleth itself so
soon as the matter is coagulated in the Puckle-pot. Put t out and let
it
cool, and strike the Faeces from the Regulus, which appeareth and
shineth
like a marchasite. The Faeces you may lay up till you know what to do
with
it for in it is a mystery of which I will not speak at this time. Put
the
Regulus into a crucible again and let it flow; when it floweth, then
cast
therein one and one-half part of Antimony and let them flow well
together,
then put in as much Niter as you did before, and let it flow as ye did
at the first time, cast it into the Puckle, strike the Regulus off from
the Faeces. This Regulus is purer and finer than the first. Cast away
the
Faeces for they are worth nothing. Let the Regulus melt the third time
in a Crucible, and when it flows, pour thereon a ladle of Nitre, and
when
you see that the Nitre floweth on the Metal as an Oyl (which must be
done
with strong fire otherwise the Nitre coagulateth itself and be hard)
then
cast it into a puckle, strike the Regulus from the Faeces. This Regulus
is yet finer, purer and more Metalline than the former; the Faeces are
nothing worth. Fourthly, let this Regulus melt in a clean Crucible, and
when it is melted as pure Luna, cast some Nitre thereon, let it
penetrate
through each other and then cast it into a Puckle, beat the Faeces off
from the Regulus, which Faeces will be of a golden color and then it is
prepared. The Regulus will be as white as Luna, and have above a fine
Star;
this Regulus, if it be rightly wrought, will weigh four ounces and the
work may well be finished in two hours. Some copies say twelve hours
and
in this manner is common Antimony prepared, wherein you shall mark this
piece, viz., what it is that thus divideth the Faeces from Antimony.
You
shall not think that Nitre doth it, but know that Antimony draweth out
the soul from Mars, that is his best Sulphur, and reduceth the same
into
Mercury; this Mercury is nothing else but fire, and hath the operation
of fire digesteth the crude Mercury into Antimony and divideth the Mine
from the metal; you shall also know that this mercury of Mars is hid in
this purged Antimony, under the whiteness of the Antimonial Mercury;
for
this Lunary whiteness which you see in the Regulus is not from his
Sulphur
but from Argent vive, under which lurketh Mercury of Mars which is
nothing
else than Sol: this Mercury of Mars is also nothing else in the
aforesaid
Mercury of Antimony than as a Spirit or an air, and remaineth so long
living
in the Argent vive of Antimony till out of it be made a body again,
this
is Sol and then divideth itself from the Mercury of Antimony. </p>
  <p>So now you understand what fire is which thus purifieth common
Antimony;
you must also understand what that fire is which purifieth and
digesteth
magical Antimony, that is, what that Sol Philosophur is which we call
Aurum
Potabile which even so well Mercury divideth itself in the end from
Mercury
Philosophor as the Sol divideth itself from the Argent vive of
Antimony.
Therefore, it is very necessary that you seriously consider how it
worketh,
so shall you find what nature is; not only in common Metals, but even
in
all things, and in the Metals of Philosophers, which are known to the
Wise
men. The chymists do assay Antimony by iron; when they have done this,
they know not what they have made, nor the working of Nature, nor do
they
know what Nature is here: therefore teach they nothing, but remain
Fools
and Asses. Seeing that they have now divided Antimony from his Mineral
Faeces, they should also know that in this Antimony there is as yet a
Faeces,
which is nothing else than a burning Sulphur; when this Sulphur is
divided,
so cometh Antimony again into his first matter or being, which is
nothing
else but Argent vive, and this Argent vive is created out of the
greatest
Mystery of Nature but Plato commandeth me to rest here. (Vide: Nicholas
the Allobrogian). </p>
  <p>To divide the Sulphur from the purged Antimony is the clearest
operation
but therein is a great knowledge hidden: so much thereof as is
necessary
for the knowledge of this Work will I manifest; but the other for
divers
reasons will I pass by. </p>
  <p>A thing, if it be destroyed and mortified, it shall be raised
again
and made living; and the same thing which is the cause of death by
separating
the life must have two powers in it, of separating and vivifying; and
these
two must be one in power, but two in numbers for all Mysteries spring
from
this Fountain and are one essence, wonderfully distributed according to
the will of God. This Will of God is the specifick of every creature
and
a being incomprehensible by sense not less than God. Now is Argent Vive
dead in Antimony. Shall it be made living, so must it be raised up by
that
which it hath been ere it was dead Mercury for that life is in it very
abundant and incorruptible; nothing which is dead can be made living
but
by his own and proper life and not by the life of other things; who
writeth
and teacheth otherwise is on philosopher, and the destroyed life, when
it is again made living, is the Ferment of living things by which it
was
made living, is the Ferment of living things by which it was made
living;
and that thing is by Augmentation and Multiplication, Magical. Hence it
followeth that in living things there must be a disposition which is
transmutable
into the disposition of other things, if it would be raised again: for
the Will of God that all things must die, is that Specifick of all
Creatures
which after death augmenteth itself infinitely. </p>
  <p>Now it followeth farther that those living things which are
serviceable
to our work and manual operation, by which the Metals are also
transmuted
into Sol, must also have such a Specifick in that they can be brought
thus
by no art without Regeneration as the senseless Alchymists give forth;
for were there no Specifick therein, how could they be transmuted,
because
Species is not transmuted into Species; for if transmutation be not
done,
so can also no seed grow and augment itself; for that is against
Nature.
Therefore must that living have the nature of water as you can see that
a grain of Corn cast into the Earth is made living by water, that is,
in
the Grain is a dead water, which is by water made living again, and the
Ferment of water is that which giveth the water his Specifick Nature,
so
do infinite grains grow from one. So understand in this operation that
the Argent Vive of Antimony is dead, and can never be made living but
by
Argent Vive. In this manner is corruption regenerated, and
multiplication
in the form of Metal made. </p>
  <p>You may here demand, seeing the water multiplieth the grains in
the
earth, and is transmuted into very grains, if also the Argent Vive of
Metals
multiplied with common Mercury, may be made again into a Metal? To this
I answer that this is not possible in common Metals, but in
Philosophical
Metals it may be done very easily for our Mercury layeth his Specifick
from him,, and taketh it again by Art; that is, from him may be made
Sol
and Luna, which it was before, but why this cannot be done in common
Metals,
there are many Reasons, which I will pass by at this time. Now the
Mercury
of Antimony shall be living; that is Argent Vive shall be made per
Argent
Vive; but this cannot be done without mixture, and farther, we see that
Regulus will not mingle in it with common Argent Vive because of the
Sulphur
which is in the Regulus; for seeing the same is not Metalline, it hath
no communion with the Argent Vive because of the Sulphur which is in
the
Regulus; for seeing the same is not Metalline, it hath no communion
with
the Argent Vive that is common, and it hindereth the mixture. Therefore
must there be a medium betwixt common Argent Vive and the mercury of
Antimony;
this medium must be a separative power, which is not in common Argent
Vive,
for in it is no specifick; and the separative power is a Specifick
which
coagulateth Mercury. God hath made this Argent Vive in the will of man,
that he can bring a Specifick to them, which is necessary for there is
none there: according to these things, viz., the separative is a
Specifick
Mercurial, but one must know in what Mercury it is to be found, and by
experience it is found that it is in no other Mercury than in the
Mercury
of Luna. </p>
  <p>Therefore, take of Luna Purissimae one ounce, Reguli Praedici half
an
ounce, let the Luna glow well in a crucible, afterwards cast the
Regulus
on it, so will they melt presently and stand in the Crucible as fine
Argent
vive, cast them into an ingot, and you shall find a Mass metalline of
the
colour of Lead; beat this metalline mass to a powder, which will easily
be done. Afterward, take fine Argent vive, four or five ounces, pour it
in a small Phial and then pour the powder on it, let it stand a night
and
day in Balneum Maria, so goeth the powder into Argent vive; stir it
well
together and when the powder is well mingled with the common Argent
vive,
then pour it out and amalgam it well on a stone, so will the Amalgam
thereof
be red. Put this Amalgam into a wooden dish, and rub it well with a
Pestle,
so will the water be black; cast off this water and put more water on,
and rub it till this water be black also. Do this so long toll the
Amalgam
be made white, the blackness which is washed from the Amalgam settleth
itself in the bottom of the water, which keep, and cast the water away
again, put this Amalgam again into a Phial, let it stand in a B.M. all
night, pour it out and wash it again. So giveth it a blackness again,
which
pour to the other, wash it so long till it give no more blackness; you
may also grind this Amalgam with pure, clean salt, so cometh the
blackness
the sooner from it. Now when the Amalgam is made clean again, set it
again
in a Phial in a B.M. all night and wash it again. Reiterated this work
so often till no more blackness goeth from the Amalgam, then will it be
pure, clean and bright and white; and mark the more blackness the
Amalgam
giveth, the more Mercury is resolved from the Antimony. So soon as no
more
blackness showeth itself (Abstract and cohobate 7 or 9times, then &#8216;tis
Philosophical Mercury) in washing presently, then distill in a glass
retort
the Argent vive from Luna. If the washing is rightly done, so shall you
find your Luna bright and clear and white in the retort; but if your
Luna
be of a leaden colour, it is a sign that it hath as yet Antimony
amongst
it; therefore must this washing be done for so long and oft till no
more
blackness come forth; the Recipient must be full of cold water ere you
distill the Mercury into it, then you shall find a bright Argent vive
which
now is threefold, viz., Argent vive Common: Argent vive Antimony, and
Mercury
of Mars. This you must know that Mercury of Mars transmuteth the other
two into his Nature, as other Metals do, because Mercurius Martis is
not
universally and radically mixed with the other two, but divideth itself
from them, as you shall hear. Therefore, this Argent vive is not called
Argent vive of Mars, but Mercury of Antimony for Antimony of is fuller
of Mercury. That Arg. Vive of Mars which is hid in this Mercury of
Antimony,
is Sol volatile; and this you may not only believe, but also see it
with
your Eyes. If you take a little of the Amalgam washed clean, and gently
evaporate the Arg. Vive from Luna, so remaineth the Aurum Volatil, that
is, the Mercury of Mars with the Luna, and tingeth the Luna into the
highest
coloured Sol. But, seeing that this Sol is not fixt, the Fire driveth
this
Tincture from Luna. Here also is a point to be marked, that this Sol
Volatil,
which tinges Luna into Gold, but not fixed. Who understandeth the cause
of this is not ignorant of the Sophistications of the Alchymist who
would
tinge Luna into Sol for they understand that Mercury alone is the
Tincture;
but then it is changed into Metals, then it loseth the power of
Tingeing,
and if it were fixt, so is a fine Metal, for Metals are nothing else
than
Mercury coagulated and fixed. But in this Work are only mercury
coagulated
or fixed. How Mercury of Antimony tingeth Luna is a more subtil manual
operation. He that will make it, must well know the fire; therefore
look
well thereto; I myself have oftimes made it and I have also oft failed.
  </p>
  <p>Now how the Mercury of Mars shall be fixed into true Sol and the
Mercury
of Antimony shall be transmuted from other Metals into this nature will
I not hold from you. For in this operation every one seeth what the
Metals
are, who have not his five senses bewitched (I speak of true
coagulation,
not sophistical) and can mark that it is not possible to make Sol from
Venus, or out of Saturn and Jupiter Silver; so sees he also very well
that
common Mercury will not be coagulated artificially; but the Arg. Vive
of
Metals easily, which before hath been coagulated; yet not every Mercury
coagulated, but the Mercury alone of mars; for in this Mercury of Mars
is found the nature of the last fixation; but in Saturn Jupiter Venus
not.
Therefore cannot any man give them that which they have not from God
and
Nature. It troubleth me not that many Chymical Books are written
against
the Truth, what the searcher of Alchymy imagineth and understandeth in
this Transmutations is altogether another thing; therefore can I write
of this Sophistry and speak with Paracelsus: They which understand
Alchymy
according to the letter, reap nothing but tare straw. Now concerning
the
Mercury before mentioned, which is distilled from Luna you shall know
that
it penetrateth the Metals and divideth the Elements of the Metals; that
is, the Mercury and Sulphur from one another; common Mercury doth it
not;
it must then be actuated by the Mercury of Antimony and be changed in
his
nature and essence, as now is declared to you in this operation. You
shall
also know that every Metal hath his peculiar operation, and is not
resolved
as another. I will in an hour bring out Mercury out of Saturn out of
Venus
can I hardly d it in two months. Therefore, much lieth in the manual
operation. </p>
  <p>The practice how it is performed with the Mercury of Venus must I
here
shew, for this cause that you may find the Gold which coming from Mars,
lieth hid in the Mercury of Venus. That is it of which I have made
mention;
this Sol is nothing else than the Mercurial Spirit which is in Mars, as
the soul in man; but seeing this Sol is no more corporeal, as it was
before
in but through the Mercurial Spirit of Antimony is made a Spirit; it
can
no more be corporal but only by the Spirit of Salt in Venus. This
Spirit
is not the Mercury of Venus, also not Sulphur, but a middle betwixt
both;
when this middle cometh forth of Venus, then do his parts fall in
pieces,
that is, his Mercury and Sulphur, the Mercury of Venus abideth in the
Antimony;
the Sulphur must be washed from it, and is a Sulphureous gray Earth
like
Ashes. </p>
  <p>Take 1.2 of the best Hungarian Vitriol, dissolve it in common
water,
set it in a strong Pot over the fire, and cast a handful of small
pieces
of iron therein. Let them seeth half a quarter of an hour; then put
away
the water, and put to the Iron the Mercury which has been distilled
from
Luna, so the Venus which the Iron reduceth from Vitriol amalgamates
itself
with the Arg. Vive: Wash the Amalgam clean, that all the pieces of Iron
come from it; now when this Amalgam is wholly pure and clean, let it
dry
and then put it in a Glass-Phial, set it in B.M. and let it stand there
eight days, so will this Amalgam be of a dark gray; then pour it out
and
wash it clean as men are wont to do with an Amalgam, in a Dish. The
powder
which is washed from the Amalgam put apart; put this Amalgam eight days
in B.M., and then wash it as before; this work must be reiterated
thrice.
If you would resolve all the Venus into Mercury and Sulphur, then must
you do this so oft till the Amalgam be made into pure Arg. vive; for it
will not be done so quickly. When you have had this Amalgam thrice in
B.M.
and thrice washed, then distill the Arg. vive from the Venus; as you
drew
it before from the Luna. This is called Mercury of Venus: for it is no
more vulgar, nor yet is it Mercury of Antimony but through the Mercury
of Venus it is fermented and transmuted into the Mercury of Venus. This
Mercury of Venus is a wonderful Mercury, as very one can try who shall
use it in Chymical Operations. </p>
  <p>The precipitate also made of this Mercury is exceeding bright and
wonderful
in the eyes of Alchymists; but as bright as it is, it is a gross poison
in physick. Keep yourself from it, let not his fine appearance deceive
you. In this Mercury of Venus is O out of Mars, which I have oft
mentioned,
yet hidden. It wanteth the frigidity of the Moon, by which it shall be
coagulated in the perpetual and first coagulation of Sol; and the
process
of coagulation is thus: </p>
  <p>Take of fine Luna one part wherein is no Gold, of the Mercury of
Venus,
parts IV, make an Amalgam thereof, and that the Amalgam may the easier
be accomplished, dissolve the Luna in common Aqua Fortis and
precipitate
it with Mercury Venus, as it is commonly done. So falleth the Luna to
the
bottom and is a fine, bright powder, which may easily, by grinding, be
Amalgamated with the Mercury of Venus. Wash this Amalgam that is clean
and bright, put it onto a Phial, and let it stand for 24 hours in B.M.
boiling, then will it be black as a Coal; take it out, grind it on a
stone,
and wash it clean; this blackness is the Soul of mars which is drawn
from
the Spirit of Antimony and in this last work is coagulated into Sol.
With
this Sol there are as yet Faeces of Sulphur, which separate themselves
from the Mercury of Venus through this coagulation; for the Mercury of
Venus is always green in the superficies. This Green shall be
coagulated
with Sol or Luna and begin separated from Arg. vive shall be reduced
into
a body, and so is the Spirit of Mars found; and so you see what it was
and again what is from him. Now who hath a desire to take pains, he may
try how much Mercury is in one pound of Ars, so much Sol shall he find
therein and not more. He shall also see that more cost goeth to this
work
than the Sol is worth. The Arg. vive which is in other Metals cannot be
so coagulated into Sol; but it continually remaineth living; the
Reasons
having been shown before. Thus is the Arg. vive vulgar actuated with
the
mercury of Antimony, that it draweth all the Mercury from imperfect
Metals
and is transmuted by them into their Nature. As it cometh to pass in
Venus,
have I here declared by the way of Sol out of Mars, which must be in
this
work for the purifying of Antimony; so have you also heard how this Sol
is again extracted out and appeareth before the eyes; otherwise you
would
not believe that the purification of Antimony is done by the Sol in
Mars. </p>
  <p>Now will I farther write to you what Medicine there is in common
Antimony;
afterward for a conclusion will I impart to you as a brother, what
farther
out of this Regulus of Antimony can be made; for I dare not in truth
boast
and say, that it is not unknown to me, and I will write to you for a
warning
(If God give you his grace that you can understand) what it is that
seduceth
so many people, yea, even the Learned; and captivated them and brought
them even to their Grave. </p>
  <p><b>De Sulphure Antimonii ~</b> </p>
  <p>Now concerning the other part of Antimony, that is, his Sulphur,
you
shall know that it is a fatness and assimulateth itself to the Fire
which
is in a black Coal. Therefore, take the blackness which you have washed
from the Amalgam of Luna and Antimony, dry it in the Sun or otherwise
in
some gentle warmth. So shall you have a powder of a leaden colour to
which,
as yet, some Arg. vive vulgar doth cleave, abiding with it in the
washing
so now if you can stifle this powder in a close warmth as Colliers make
wood Coals, then will it be black, and altogether like beaten or
powdered
Coals: but if you cannot so stifle, its no great matter. </p>
  <p>Take this powder of a lead colour, put it into a Crucible, put it
on
the fire, but make it not to glow, wither inwardly or outwardly; so
will
the mercury fume away. This powder is inflamed by the warmth, and
burneth
not as Sulphur with a flame, but as a glimmering dry coal which giveth
no flame. When it is so burnt out, there remaineth in the Crucible a
powder
which may be reduced into Regulus. Weigh this powder, so shall you see
how much of the Antimony is resolved into his parts, and if you could
dry
up this powder that it be black, and the Common mercury cometh from it,
so may you reckon how much of the Common Mercury is come into this
Mercury
of Antimony and how much combustible Sulphur was in this Arg. vive. So
then you have the knowledge of Antimony fully; that is, his Elements of
Arg. vive and Sulphur. This is enough to shew what Antimony is, and how
the common Arg. vive is fermented and actuated through and with it;
that
it can thereby resolve the other Metals, every one according to his
nature
and disposition. How it is done in Venus the process is sufficiently
declared
for examples sake: But how it is to be done in other Metals, viz., how
by the Mercury of Venus, and Mercury may be brought forth, that I
commend
to the experienced and skilled with the Fire: For it was not my purpose
to manifest all things. </p>
  <p><b>The Medicinal Sweet ~</b> </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s known to you before to prepare many ways of Antimony for
Physick,
but I have not as yet seen any who have observed the Arcanum in it. The
good people imagine that whatsoever is written of Antimony is written
of
Common Antimony, which notwithstanding they find not by the proof;
therefore
we may justly think that Medicinal Antimony is much another thing, as
indeed
it is. For the Antimony of the Philosophers is their Mercury, and in it
are all medicines in potentia, therefore it is called, Quintessence. In
the Vulgar Antimony, is not the Quintessence of physick, but only the
essence
of the Element of Water, which Essence is a Medicine against the
sicknesses
which spring out of the Microcosmical Fire. Now the Physick of this
Antimony
is not in his mercury, but in his Fire, of the which I have spoken
briefly,
which you shall in this manner understand: In Wood there is a fire
which
we must have in our Kitchens to prepare our meats; so is Antimony a
fire
by which we digest our Medicines which thereby receiveth the essence of
his Elements. Through this Essence, the elemental heat in our sickness
is also digested. For thought the Galenists think to drive forth the
heat
through Purslane, Endive, Nightshade and other cold Simples, but cannot
do it, for the heat looseth itself naturally; so is this Medicine in
Antimony
Vulgar and not only in it, but in all other things of the which the
Element
of Water is the Mother. Therefore, is a Physician even so little bound
to this Antimony as a Cook to Beech-wood; for when he hath it not, then
he useth Birch or Willow, by the which he cannot so well dress his
meat.
Besides this essential Medicine as well in other things as in Antimony,
and is called in Magick Aurum. But of that Medicine which is prepared
by
the Fire of Antimony, I have nothing to say. It is known of to God and
to those He hath manifested it. The wise men call it their Mercurius
Philosophor
and it is an Essence which may be changed in all the Elements of Nature
and Art; for we know that this Antimony purgeth strongly upward and
downward,
which is done not by the Essence but by the body to which the Essence
changeth.
Now who can divide the Essence from the Body, he hath found a Medicine
that worketh neither upward nor downward, but without purgation
finisheth
the work and through a strong Calcination with Salt Spirit, which is
the
cause of a Metalline Fusion, it be driven from it, that it causeth
neither
Vomit nor Stool, but forceth sweat. Yet it is not the medicine, but
Antimony
calcined which is a poison as the other Metals are, which are strongly
calcined which taken in the body manifests it as calcined Venus, Saturn
Mars. It may also be well digested by Sulphur Metalline, that it may be
red and fixed in the fire, yet is there not in it that which the Artist
seeketh. Therefore, all is lost which is begun with this Medicine.
There
is then a thing which divideth his essence from his Body: </p>
  <p><b>Of the Secrets in Regulus ~</b> </p>
  <p>Farther, of divers Arcanas which are in the above mentioned
Regulus,
I have wonders to tell you; he which hath not thoroughly searched it
will
not believe me; for God lets not such things be common, and come forth
publickly, especially in these base times, in the which Honor and
Shame,
Virtue and Vice, Lying and Truth are equally prized Now we seek not the
Truth, but Vain Glory; and therefore doth God infatuate our senses, and
we hate and envy one another, and destroy our wealth, and we ourselves
are the cause thereof. Farther, I warn you, that I have discovered
much,
and from my writing you may understand more than I say, but all things
shall not be written by reason of Praters and Sophisters, which flatter
themselves they have been of the Council of Jove. I will also by this
show
forth my mind to you and I wish you well from my heart, that you may
try
in these things as much as myself, and I hope that time will give that
which I cannot, and in time know what I mean. Now that I may keep my
promise,
you shall know that this Regulus hath deceived the best Philosophers
and
Chymists of greatest account and reading amongst us. For it is such a
rare
mineral that there is scarce its like in the world, and can make even
the
most earned and understanding men Fools. What is given me from it, what
I have seen from my good Companions mark. In my little Book concerning
the Mysteries of Antimony, which no man understandeth, even to this
hour,
have I said that Metal might be made out of it. So much belongeth to
this
point, I did not then cumber or trouble myself with it, but only
explained
myself and manifested the Medicines which are in it and go under its
name.
Now know that out of this Regulus all Metals may be made such as Lead,
Tin, Copper, Iron, Silver and Sol, and so made that to the appearance
and
in hammering, melting, casting proof of the test, and in the driving of
by Antimony, they are as good as the natural Metals. Lead which is made
thereof, is in all proofs, good Lead, only it is a little harder than
the
Natural; but the Lead which is made of Antimony crude, not washed, hath
not that hardness; the Tin is exceedingly fine and before coagulation,
on the Touchstone, for certain as the finest Luna; the nature of Tin
easily
taketh to its self and is easily made Tin. </p>
  <p>With the Copper it is thus also; for so soon as the Odour of Venus
is
vegetant, it penetrateth the Regulus, and giveth it the Nature of
Copper;
this operation is done very easily and quickly. You can make an ounce
of
Regulus into Copper in the time you can eat a soft egg. </p>
  <p>Iron and Antimony are easily changed one into another, therefore
is
Antimony presently mars, and out of Mars is Antimony easily made, and
also
Saturn, Jupiter and Venus may easily be reduced into Antimony, yet Mars
easiest of all. These four Metals I myself have out of Regulus; the
other
two, viz., Sol and Luna have I seen my friend make, the Luna is bright
and may be cast, hammered and beaten as other natural Luna, and may be
driven off in Saturn, and goeth not away from the Test. I thought a
long
time that it was nothing else but the Sol; but my Companion said, that
in weight, it was heavier than other Luna. I therefore, being jealous
what
it was, did endeavor to dissolve it in Aquafort made of Vitriol and
Nitre,
but it would not touch it. Then I was much troubled in my thoughts and
laid it in an Aqua Regia, and it dissolved totally. Then I thought that
in the reduction it would be Sol, but I found a white powder very like
to Tin which is calcined in Aqua Fortis. When I reduced this powder,
there
was thereout a glass of a Milkie colour, so found I what I had for good
Luna; neverthele3ss, I was not content with these proofs, hoping for
better
things; and therefore I took four ounces of this Luna and amalgamated
it
with common Mercury, and set it in a gentle heat four weeks. It was in
the Superficies black and indifferent hard; I took it out and beat it
to
pieces with a hammer and then did grind it to powder, and afterward by
oft rubbing, I made it into an Amalgam again as it was before, then
drew
I the Mercury away in a retort and found my Luna again. This Luna I
amalgamated
again not with common Mercury, but with Mercury of Antimony, of the
which
I have spoken before. </p>
  <p>This amalgam did I set, as before, three days and nights and found
that
the Amalgam, the longer it stood, the moister it was. In eight days it
was as melted Saturn, and so it stood in the fire a month. Afterwards I
took it out and distilled it by Retort, and the Mercury of Antimony,
and
the Luna came all from the Retort and was a Mercury. So know that the
Luna
made of Regulus was nothing else than Mercury coagulated, and not
constant
in a metalline form, but goeth away again and will be Mercury which
thing
might well make a Chymist a fool. Now come I to Sol, and to tell you
what
happened is a wonder. When I had showed to my good companion, who
thought
nothing else than he had got a great prize, he would not believe it but
took it into his own hands, and at length found the truth. He began to
question his Sol, and he spake, although I have oftentimes tried it,
yet
will not I trust myself, but take this half ounce of Gold and try it as
you please. Mr Hans, the Goldsmith saith it is true Gold. So took I the
Sol and brought it to the Goldsmith, and asked him if it were Gold. He
said it was and he could work it for Sol, for to the sight, Touchstone
and hammer, it was very good Sol. Nevertheless, took I the Sol and did
put to it 2 parts of Luna to granulate it and divide it in Aqua Fort.
The
Luna dissolved itself and the Salt fell to the bottom; this proof was
true;
this Sol powder I mixed with a crude Antimony, and cast it through
Regulus;
let it flow in a crucible and cast Nitre upon it and drew the Antimony
from the Sol, and drew it off with Saturn. This trial I found also
true.
This Sol, driven off, did I cast again through with Antimony and
Sulphur;
then I took the Regulus and let them go away before the Goldsmiths
Bellows,
for I had none. This trial was good also (the Sol stood), on which
every
Chymist may justly rejoice. Nevertheless, seeing the Luna deceived me,
therefore could I not trust the Sol, but causeth it to be beaten very
thin,
and amalgamated it with my Mercury of Antimony, and did set it four
weeks
in a gentle warmth and took notice that the Amalgam was not hard, but
soft,
which was grievous to me. Nevertheless, I did let it stand four weeks
and
found my Amalgam much moister after then when I put it in. Then did I
put
it into a Crucible over a small fire, that the Crucible did not fully
glow,
and my Mercury flew away incredibly swiftly from the Sol that I did not
mark it but thought that my Mercury was coagulated into Sol, but when I
weighed by Sol I found no more than half an ounce and 2 Quintileins
(drams)
and thought certainly that the two Quintileins were pure gold. </p>
  <p>These two Quintileins I proved further with Mercury of Antimony in
the
same manner as the first time. Then at length I evaporated the Mercury
from it, and found my 2 Quintileins again. Then was I merry and hoped
that
my companion would communicate his Preparation to me and had Golden
Mountains
in
my head and I brought a good Message to my Companion. But he himself
was
not merry, but spake evil of it. Well, said he, I had great labor and
pains
with this Sol, and more than I do say: what cannot be, that I cannot
desire.
But let it be a fine sophistication that which hath been made, for the
Gold-seeking Alchymists which run hither and thither, today devouring
one
tomorrow another. The Gold which remaineth over and above thee is not
come
from the Regulus, but it is a composition of the natural Sol; for I
could
not coagulate the Regulus into Sol if there be not good Gold with it.
This
Sol hath remained in the test, but the other not. I know how to bring
it
further and now understand the cause well, that cannot be that I hoped.
This fell into the mind of my companion and I feared the manual
operations
and I thought of my Metals. He spake that the Sulphur of Antimony which
coagulateth the mercury is not united to it in radice, therefore it
remaineth
not with it. And if thou searchest thoroughly, thy Regulus will not be
again Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and remain so, but will be mercury
again
which neither you nor any other can coagulate to a good metal as some
imagine,
when they have the Venus of Luna Saturn, that the Art will not fail
then;
but it is a Lunatick Melancholick Phantasie, from the which they that
are
not experienced in Alchymy, but only book-learned, and have gone on
hearsay,
can make arguments and conclude by themselves but when they come to the
fire they see their Folly. Tell me when a dead thing is made living?
When
is his bound of Nature, in Death or in Life? What hath it been before
death
or life? Shall any come to this fixt immutable principle? What seekest
thou then in metals vivified? But these things speak I not to thee, nor
of thee, but of the Alchymists for whom pray God that he deliver them
from
such unreasonable men. </p>
  <p>Of this sort discoursed we much together and seeing when then I
was
entangled, as to hold the printed Books of Alchymy for Gospels, but
being
led with I know not what Spirit, I doubted more than I believed.
Therefore
I always did think of the cause wherefore Alchymy was written by the
first
Philosophers, and did very often treat with this my good friend and
Companion,
well skilled in the Fire, concerning our Antimony, Saturn, Jupiter,
Venus,
Mars, Sol and Luna, in all which I found that true which the chymists
put
together for the Alchymical Art, and am in good hope that he will put
from
his this phantasie and think after the Philosophical metals. Now so
much
as belongeth to you, Noble Patron and friend, there is as yet one thing
to be handled pertaining to this operation, which I neither can nor
will
withhold from you the Chymists such as Rhasis, Peter Bonus, Ferrar,
Trevisan
and the other of the Dialogue, and many others who have well examined
the
imperfect metals, and had good experience. They at length remain in
this
opinion, that it is impossible to make Sol by the Art but out of Argent
Vive. Seeing that they see that Sol is nothing else than Argent Vive
coagulated
with its proper Sulphur and fixed, now have they also well understood
by
their operation, that Mercury cannot be fixed into perfect Sol, unless
be dissolved and brought into Mercury; this opinion have they taken
from
the ground that they see that Nature could not fix that Argent Vive of
Saturn, Jupiter, Venus with the external Sulphur which cleaved unto
them;
much less shall Art do it; whereupon, they that thought to take an
Argent
Vive which hath been perfectly fixed before and to mix this Argent Vive
with common mercury or other Metals, that both may be one Individuum;
but
seeing this mixture cannot be done with common Sol, they have taken the
Sol in mars and have though to mix it so with the common Mercury that
they
should never be separated, but that the Sol should always remain with
the
Mercury, and the Mercury with Sol. That is, where the Sol is coagulated
again and also the mercury is coagulated and fixed: in this practice
everyone
hath had his way or working, according to his understanding, and have
spent
long time herein; but this much is certain to me, that they always did,
ere they obtained the end of their speculation. Therefore, saith the
worthy
Trithemius, that Alchymy is a perpetual Virgin and writeth of it thus:
Chymia is beloved by many and yet, She is chaste. She hath many
domestic
servants which keep their mistress with watchful Eyes and oft take upon
themselves her name that they may preserve her from the embracements of
so many importunated Lovers, and always unpolluted: Vanity, fraud,
deceit,
sophistication, covetousness, falseness, boldness, lying, foolishness,
poverty, desperation, proscription, cheating are the Lackeys of
Chymistry:
who feigning themselves to be the Mistress, that they may keep her
unravished,
do freely prostitute themselves to rich, covetous, worldly and proud
Lovers.
Thus much. He that will not believe the true man, may search and try
according
to his Phantasie, as I and others have sufficiently done. What I have
told
you here, cometh from experience that it is so. Who hath a desire to
spend
his money and time thereon, he shall find it so. </p>
  <p>Thus have I finished what I promised to write of the Mercury of
Antimony,
and also what the Ancients have sought and found in this Mercury of
Antimony.
All which have I truly declared; on which you may conclude whether this
mineral is known to me or not. They which boast that they can make the
Mercury of Metals without Argent Vive, they give us to understand that
they are not Philosophers, and that they know not what Corruption,
Regeneration
and the Multiplication of things is, and if they did rightly behold
their
work, they would see that they are deceived. Let Boasters be Boasters;
believe in these things nothing but what your see, and consider always
the possibility of Nature, so shall you come easily out of this
Labyrinth. </p>
  <p>Lastly, I desire that you would not be offended that I have held
you
so long with this Treatise; the condition at present which I suffer,
permits
little rest to write of this Operation, therefore have I cast it on the
paper so miserably; when I have more leisure, I will finish other
writings,
which, as yet, for want of opportunity, I cannot. </p>
  <p>The Alchymists everlasting God dominate the Lovers of Truth with
His
Spirit and bring them out of the Bonds of thick darkness and
unprofitable
talk of supposed Learned men. </p>
  <p>Amen. </p>

  <p><b>How to Make the Salt of Antimony ~</b> </p>
  <p>Powder good Hungarian Antimony, small as meal, and calcine it over
a
gentle coal fire as men usually do. Always stirring it with an Iron
till
all be whitish and it smoke no more, but endureth an indifferent strong
Fire. Then put it into a crucible and melt it into a transparent yellow
Glass; beat this Glass small, put it into a retort Glass, and pour on
it
strong distilled Wine Vinegar. Let it stand in gentle warmth, and the
Vinegar
will extract the tincture of Antimony, and will be coloured very high,
which Tincture, or extract of Antimony may be further prepared and be
used
for an excellent medicine. (V. Bas. Val. Trium. Mag.) </p>
  <p>Now when the Tincture is all extracted, and coloureth no more the
Vinegar,
ten dry the powder at the bottom wholly, which will be black. Grind it
with so much yellow Sulphur, and put it into a melting pot, well luted,
and place in an indifferent fire till the Sulphur be wholly burnt away.
Then grind the matter remaining very small ad pour on it new distilled
Vinegar and draw the Salt thereby, and afterwards through reiterated
distillations,
draw off the eagerness of the Vinegar from it, and clarifie the Salt
with
the Spirit of Wine, till it be bright, clear and white. If thou hath
wrought
rightly, thou shall have the salt of Antimony wholly fixt and active,
although
there is another way to make the Salt of Antimony, which is written
elsewhere. </p>
  <p>Dose: 4 gr and it is equal to the Salt of Sol and cureth diseases
(and
may easily be made Sol). </p>
  <p><b>The Use of the Salt of Antimony ~</b> </p>
  <p>This Salt of Antimony is of a wonderful operation; for it performs
almost
all that the Salt of Gold doth, given in like quantity; it cleanseth
the
whole body of man, purifieth the Blood, expels all Evils, consumes all
obnoxious Humours, whence all open sores have their beginning and
recourse
to; it cures the French disease, taken 4 gr at the most with a dram of
the distilled water of Lignum Vitae, sweating upon it, and this used
daily
until amendment. </p>
  <p>The water of Lignum Vitae is thus made: First, grind it small,
then
moisten it with good Spirit of Wine in a Vessel close stopt. Let it
stand
certain days in a gentle heat; this done, pour a good quantity of
Fumitory
water or Scabious water, upon it. Digest then, 14 days in a Bath, then
distill it; Preserve the Liquor apart, and the Oyl apart, in Glasses
close
stopt. Use the water with the Salt of Antimony. It is likewise used
with
good success in other diseases whereof we treated in another place; but
an understanding Physician knows very well what virtues are in
Guaiacum,
and what benefit it doth in the cure of diseases. There are other ways
to distill a Water and Oyl of the said Wood which is needless to be
mentioned
here. </p>
  <p>The Salt of Antimony checks the Leprosie and other deep-rooted
Diseases;
it is good against the Gout, and weakness of the joints, purifies and
makes
good blood, corroborates the Heart and the Balsam of Man&#8217;s Body drunk
with
a spoonful of Aqua Vitae; it restoreth lost strength, opens all
internal
Imposthumes, cleanses all external corroding sores, being strewed into
them, or duly applied with good Plasters or Ointments, being dissolved
in good distilled Wine Vinegar, it doth in a short time bring great
ease
to evil and incurable Sores to all Admiration. Being drunk with waters
of Wormwood of Carduus Benedictus, it cures all Agues of long standing,
which are deeply rooted, and admit no cure, especially the Quartane.
Being
drunk with Mint or Wormwood-water, it causeth a good digestion; drunk
with
waters of Speedwell, Red Corn-Rose-water causeth a good memory. </p>
  <p>This Salt is used in Alchymy or Transmutation of Metals into Gold.
If
you add to it the fatness that drips out of the wheels of the Chariot
of
the Sun, when as the Alchymists Phaeton undertook to drive it, as the
Poets
describe it in their Alchymical Fiction. For the excellent Fictions of
the Poets which they produce and write concerning the Celestial Gods,
are
nothing else but Covers to conceal the Secret Arts and Mysteries of
Alchymy.
As of Apollo when he slew the Serpent Python; as also the adultery of
Mars
and Venus, and it shall be proved as I am of the opinion, that Chymical
Operations are revealed in Poetical Fictions, when they write of the
Loves
and Venereal Actions of the Gods and Goddesses; as also when they
introduce
various and wonderful Metamorphoses and Transmutations; for if we
should
understand their Fables literally, we should prejudice wise Antiquity,
to think that such understanding and wise persons should believe and
write
such and so many wicked things of the Gods. </p>
