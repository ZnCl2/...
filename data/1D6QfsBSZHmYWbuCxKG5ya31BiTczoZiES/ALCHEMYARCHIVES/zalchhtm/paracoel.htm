<br><b>of Theophrastus Paracelsus</b>
<br><b>to All Alchemists and Readers of this Book</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>You who are skilled in Alchemy, and as many others as promise yourselves
great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and silver, which Alchemy in
different ways promises and teaches; equally, too, you who willingly undergo
toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them, until you have
attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of the promises made to you;
experience teaches this every day, that out of thousands of you not even
one accomplishes his desire. Is this a failure of Nature or of Art? I say,
no; but it is rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness of the
operator.
<p>Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of the stars and planets
of heaven, together with the other names, inverted words, receipts, materials,
and instruments are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with
this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these same subjects
in the present book, although the use of such signs, names, and characters
at the proper time is by no means without advantage.
<p>But herein will be noticed another way of treating Alchemy different
from the previous method, and deduced by Seven Canons from the sevenfold
series of the metals. This, indeed, will not give scope for a pompous parade
of words, but, nevertheless, in the consideration of those Canons everything
which should be separated from Alchemy will be treated at sufficient length,
and, moreover, many secrets of other things are herein contained. Hence,
too, result certain marvellous speculations and new operations which frequently
differ from the writings and opinions of ancient operators and natural
philosophers, but have been discovered and confirmed by full proof and
experimentation.
<p>Moreover, in this Art nothing is more true than this, though it be little
known and gains small confidence. All the fault and cause of difficulty
in Alchemy, whereby very many persons are reduced to poverty, and others
labour in vain, is wholly and solely lack of skill in the operator, and
the defect or excess of materials, whether in quantity or quality, whence
it ensues that, in the course of operation, things are wasted or reduced
to nothing. If the true process shall have been found, the substance itself
while transmuting approaches daily more and more towards perfection. The
straight road is easy, but it is found by very few.
<p>Sometimes it may happen that a speculative artist may, by his own eccentricity,
think out for himself some new method in Alchemy, be the consequence anything
or nothing. He need do nought in order to reduce something into nothing,
and again bring back something out of nothing. Yet this proverb of the
incredulous is not wholly false. Destruction perfects that which is good;
for the good cannot appear on account of that which conceals it. The good
is least good whilst it is thus concealed. The concealment must be removed
that so the good may be able freely to appear in its own brightness. For
example, the mountain, the sand, the earth, or the stone in which a metal
has grown is such a concealment. Each one of the visible metals is a concealment
of the other six metals.
<p>By the element of fire all that is imperfect is destroyed and taken
away, as, for instance, the five metals, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
and Saturn. On the other hand, the perfect metals, Sol and Luna, are not
consumed in that same fire. They remain in the fire: and at the same time,
out of the other imperfect ones which are destroyed, they assume their
own body and become visible to the eyes. How, and by what method, this
comes about can be gathered from the Seven Canons. Hence it may be learnt
what are the nature and property of each metal, what it effects with the
other metals, and what are its powers in commixture with them.
<p>But this should be noted in the very first place: that these Seven Canons
cannot be perfectly understood by every cursory reader at a first glance
or a single reading. An inferior intelligence does not easily perceive
occult and abstruse subjects. Each one of these Canons demands no slight
discussion. Many persons, puffed up with pride, fancy they can easily comprehend
all which this book comprises. Thus they set down its contents as useless
and futile, thinking they have something far better of their own, and that
therefore they can afford to despise what is here contained.

<p><b>Part I</b>.
<p><b><font size=+1>The Seven Canons of the Metals</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The First Canon</b>.
<br><b>Concerning the Nature and Properties of Mercury</b></center>

<p>All things are concealed in all. One of them all is the concealer of
the rest ---&nbsp; their corporeal vessel, external, visible, and movable.
All liquefactions are manifested in that vessel. For the vessel is a living
and corporeal spirit, and so all coagulations or congelations enclosed
in it, when prevented from flowing and surrounded, are not therewith content.
No name can be found for this liquefaction, by which it may be designated;
still less can it be found for its origin. And since no heat is so strong
as to be equalised therewith, it should be compared to the fire of Gehenna.
A liquefaction of this kind has no sort of connection with others made
by the heat of natural fire, or congelated or coagulated by natural cold.
These congelations, through their weakness, are unable to obtain in Mercury,
and therefore, on that account, he altogether contemns them. Hence one
may gather that elementary powers, in their process of destruction, can
add nothing to, nor take away anything from, celestial powers (which are
called Quintessence or its elements), nor have they any capacity for operating.
Celestial and infernal powers do not obey the four elements, whether they
be dry, moist, hot, or cold. No one of them has the faculty of acting against
a Quintessence; but each one contains within itself its own powers and
means of action.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b>The Second Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning the Nature and Properties of Jupiter</b>.</center>

<p>In that which is manifest (that is to say, the body of Jupiter) the
other six corporeal metals are spiritually concealed, but one more deeply
and more tenaciously than another. Jupiter has nothing of a Quintessence
in his composition, but is of the nature of the four elementaries. On this
account this liquefaction is brought about by the application of a moderate
fire, and, in like manner, he is coagulated by moderate cold. He has affinity
with the liquefactions of all the other metals. For the more like he is
to some other nature, the more easily he is united thereto by conjunction.
For the operation of those nearly allied is easier and more natural than
of those which are remote. The remote body does not press upon the other.
At the same time, it is not feared, though it may be very powerful. Hence
it happens that men do not aspire to the superior orders of creation, because
they are far distant from them, and do not see their glory. In like manner,
they do not much fear those of an inferior order, because they are remote,
and none of the living knows their condition or has experienced the misery
of their punishment. For this cause an infernal spirit is accounted as
nothing. For more remote objects are on that account held more cheaply
and occupy a lower place, since according to the propriety of its position
each object turns out better, or is transmuted. This can be proved by various
examples.
<p>The more remote, therefore, Jupiter is found to be from Mars and Venus,
and the nearer Sol and Luna, the more "goldness" or "silveriness", if I
may so say, it contains in its body, and the greater, stronger, more visible,
more tangible, more amiable, more acceptable, more distinguished, and more
true it is found than in some remote body. Again, the more remote a thing
is, of the less account is it esteemed in all the respects aforesaid, since
what is present is always preferred before what is absent. In proportion
as the nearer is clear the more remote is occult. This, therefore, is a
point which you, as an Alchemist, must seriou(S)ly debate with yourself,
how you can relegate Jupiter to a remote and abstruse place, which Sol
and Luna occupy, and how, in turn, you can summon Sol and Luna from remote
positions to a near place, where Jupiter is corporeally posited; so that,
in the same way, Sol and Luna also may really be present there corporeally
before your eyes. For the transmutation of metals from imperfection to
perfection there are several practical receipts. Mix the one with the other.
Then again separate the one pure from the other. This is nothing else but
the process of permutation, set in order by perfect alchemical labour.
Note that Jupiter has much gold and not a little silver. Let Saturn and
Luna be imposed on him, and of the rest Luna will be augmented.

<p><b>The Third Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning Mars and His Properties</b>.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The six occult metals have expelled the seventh from them, and have
made it corporeal, leaving it little efficacy, and imposing on it great
hardness and weight. This being the case, they have shaken off all their
own strength of coagulation and hardness, which they manifest in this other
body. On the contrary, they have retained in themselves their colour and
liquefaction, together with their nobility. It is very difficult and laborious
for a prince or a king to be produced out of an unfit and common man. But
Mars acquires dominion. with strong and pugnacious hand, and seizes on
the position of king. He should, however, be on his guard against snares;
that he be not led captive suddenly and unexpectedly. It must also be considered
by what method Mars may be able to take the place of king, and Sol and
Luna, with Saturn, hold the place of Mars.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b>The Fourth Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning Venus and its Properties.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The other six metals have rendered Venus an extrinsical body by means
of all their colour and method of liquefaction. It may be necessary, in
order to understand this, that we should show, by some examples, how a
manifest thing may be rendered occult, and an occult thing rendered materially
manifest by means of fire. Whatever is combustible can be naturally transmuted
by fire from one form into another, namely, into lime, soot, ashes, glass,
colours, stones, and earth. This last can again be reduced to many new
metallic bodies. If a metal, too, be burnt, or rendered fragile by old
rust, it can again acquire malleability by applications of fire.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b>The Fifth Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning the nature and Properties of Saturn</b>.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Of his own nature Saturn speaks thus: The other six have cast me out
as their examiner. They have thrust me forth from them and from a spiritual
place. They have also added a corruptible body as a place of abode, so
that I may be what they neither are nor desire to become. My six brothers
are spiritual, and thence it ensues that so often as I am put in the fire
they penetrate my body and, together with me, perish in the fire, Sol and
Luna excepted. These are purified and ennobled in my water. My spirit is
a water softening the rigid and congelated bodies of my brothers. Yet my
body is inclined to the earth. Whatever is received into me becomes conformed
thereto, and by means of us is converted into one body. It would be of
little use to the world if it should learn, or at least believe, what lies
hid in me, and what I am able to effect. It would be more profitable it
should ascertain what I am able to do with myself. Deserting all the methods
of the Alchemists, it would then use only that which is in me and can be
done by me. The stone of cold is in me. This is a water by means of which
I make the spirits of the six metals congeal into the essence of the seventh,
and this is to promote Sol with Luna.
<p>Two kinds of Antimony are found: one the common black by which Sol is
purified when liquefied therein. This has the closest affinity with Saturn.
The other kind is the white, which is also called Magnesia and Bismuth.
It has great affinity with Jupiter, and when mixed with the other Antimony
it augments Luna.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b>The Sixth Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning Luna and the Properties Thereof</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The endeavour to make Saturn or Mars out of Luna involves no lighter
or easier work than to make Luna, with great gain, out of Mercury, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, or Saturn. It is not useful to transmute what is perfect into
what is imperfect, but the latter into the former. Nevertheless, it is
well to know what is the material of Luna, or whence it proceeds. Whoever
is not able to consider or find this out will neither be able to make Luna.
It will be asked, What is Luna? It is among the seven metals which are
spiritually concealed, itself the seventh, external, corporeal, and material.
For this seventh always contains the six metals spiritually hidden in itself.
And the six spiritual metals do not exist without one external and material
metal. So also no corporeal metal can have place or essence without those
six spiritual ones. The seven corporeal metals mix easily by means of liquefaction,
but this mixture is not useful for making Sol or Luna. For in that mixture
each metal remains in its own nature, or fixed in the fire, or flies from
it. For example, mix, in any way you can, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars,
Venus, Sol, and Luna. It will not thence result that Sol and Luna will
so change the other five that, by the agency of Sol and Luna, these will
become Sol and Luna. For though all be liquefied into a single mass, nevertheless
each remains in its nature whatever it is. This is the judgment which must
be passed on corporeal mixture. But concerning spiritual mixture and communion
of the metals, it should be known that no separation or mortification is
spiritual, because such spirits can never exist without bodies. Though
the body should be taken away from them and mortified a hundred times in
one hour, nevertheless, they would always acquire another much more noble
than the former. And this is the transposition of the metals from one death
to another, that is to say, from a lesser degree into one greater and higher,
namely, into Luna; and from a better into the best and most most perfect,
that is, into Sol, the brilliant and altogether royal metal. It is most
true, then, as frequently said above, that the six metals always generate
a seventh, or produce it from themselves clear in its <i>esse</i>.
<p>A question may arise: If it be true that Luna and every metal derives
its origin and is generated from the other six, what is then its property
and its nature? To this we reply: From Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars,
Venus, and Sol, nothing and no other metal than Luna could be made. The
cause is that each metal has two good virtues of the other six, of which
altogether there are twelve. These are the spirit of Luna, which thus in
a few words may be made known. Luna is composed of the six spiritual metals
and their virtues, whereof each possesses two. Altogether, therefore, twelve
are thus posited in one corporeal metal, which are compared to the seven
planets and the twelve celestial signs. Luna has from the planet Mercury,
and from Aquarius and Pisces, its liquidity and bright white colour. So
Luna has from Jupiter, with Sagittarius and Taurus, its white colour and
its great firmness in fire. Luna has from Mars, with Cancer and Aries,
its hardness and its clear sound. Luna has from Venus, with Gemini and
Libra, its measure of coagulation and its From Saturn, with Virgo and Scorpio,
its homogeneous body, with gravity. From Sol, with Leo and Virgo, its spotless
purity and great constancy against the power of fire. Such is the knowledge
of the natural exaltation and of the course of the spirit and body of Luna,
with its composite nature and wisdom briefly summarised.
<p>Furthermore, it should be pointed out what kind of a body such metallic
spirits acquire in their primitive generation by means of celestial influx.
For the metal-digger, when he has crushed the stone, contemptible as it
is in appearance, liquefies it, corrupts it, and altogether mortifies it
with fire. Then this metallic spirit, in such a process of mortification,
receives a better and more noble body, not friable but malleable. Then
comes the Alchemist, who again corrupts, mortifies, and artificially prepares
such a metallic body. Thus once more that spirit of the metal assumes a
more noble and more perfect body, putting itself forward clearly into the
light, except it be Sol or Luna. Then at last the metallic spirit and body
are perfectly united, are safe from the corruption of elementary fire,
and also incorruptible.<sup>8</sup>

<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p><b>The Seventh Canon.</b>
<br><b>Concerning the Nature of Sol and Its Properties</b>.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The seventh after the six spiritual metals is corporeally Sol, which
in itself is nothing but pure fire. What in outward appearance is more
beautiful, more brilliant, more clear and perceptible, a heavier, colder,
or more homogeneous body to see? And it is easy to perceive the cause of
this, namely, that it contains in itself the congelations of the other
six metals, out of which it is made externally into one most compact body.
Its liquefaction proceeds from elementary fire, or is caused by the liquations
of Mercury, with Pisces and Aquarius, concealed spiritually within it.
The most manifest proof of this is that Mercury is easily mingled corporeally
with the Sun as in an embrace. But for Sol, when the heat is withdrawn
and the cold supervenes after liquefaction, to coagulate and to become
hard and solid, there is need of the other five metals, whose nature it
embraces in itself --- Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna. In these five
metals the cold abodes with their regimens are especially found. Hence
it happens that Sol can with difficulty be liquefied without the heat of
fire, on account of the cold whereof mention has been made. For Mercury
cannot assist with his natural heat or liquefaction, or defend himself
against the cold of the five metals, because the heat of Mercury is not
sufficient to retain Sol in a state of liquefaction. Wherefore Sol has
to obey the five metals rather than Mercury alone. Mercury itself has no
office of itself save always to flow. Hence it happens that in coagulations
of the other metals it can effect nothing, since its nature is not to make
anything hard or solid, but liquid. To render fluid is the nature of heat
and life, but cold has the nature of hardness, consolidation, and immobility,
which is compared to death. For example, the six cold metals, Jupiter,
Venus, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna, if they are to be liquefied must be brought
to that condition by the heat of fire. Snow or ice, which are cold, will
not produce this effect, but rather will harden. As soon as ever the metal
liquefied by fire is removed therefrom, the cold, seizing upon it, renders
it hard, congelated, and immovable of itself. But in order that Mercury
may remain fluid and alive continually, say, I pray you, whether this will
be affected with heat on cold? Whoever answers that this is brought about
by a cold and damp nature, and that it has its life from cold --- the promulgator
of this opinion, having no knowledge of Nature, is led away by the vulgar.
For the vulgar man judges only falsely, and always holds firmly on to his
error. So then let him who loves truth withdraw therefrom. Mercury, in
fact, lives not at all from cold but from a warm and fiery nature. Whatever
lives is fire, because heat is life, but cold the occasion of death. The
fire of Sol is of itself pure, not indeed alive, but hard, and so far shews
the colour of sulphur in that yellow and red are mixed therein in due proportion.
The five cold metals are Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Luna, which
assign to Sol their virtues; according to cold, the body itself; according
to fire, colour; according to dryness, solidity; according to humidity,
weight; and out of brightness, sound. But that gold is not burned in the
element of terrestrial fire, nor is even corrupted, is effected by the
firmness of Sol. For one fire cannot burn another, or even consume it;
but rather if fire be added to fire it is increased, and becomes more powerful
in its operations. The celestial fire which flows to us on the earth from
the Sun is not such a fire as there is in heaven, neither is it like that
which exists upon the earth, but that celestial fire with us is cold and
congealed, and it is the body of the Sun. Wherefore the Sun can in no way
be overcome by our fire. This only happens, that it is liquefied, like
snow or ice, by that same celestial Sun. Fire, therefore, has not the power
of burning fire, because the Sun is fire, which, dissolved in heaven, is
coagulated with us.

<p><b>Note on Mercurius Vivus</b>.</center>

<p>Whatever tinges with a white colour has the nature of life, and the
properties and power of light, which causally produces life. Whatever,
on the other hand, tinges with blackness, or produces black, has a nature
in common with death, the properties of darkness, and forces productive
of death. The earth with its frigidity is a coagulation and fixation of
this kind of hardness. For the house is always dead; but he who inhabits
the house lives. If you can discover the force of this illustration you
have conquered.

<p><b>What is to be Thought Concerning the Congelation of Mercury</b>.</center>

<p>To mortify or congeal Mercury, and afterwards seek to turn it into Luna,
and to sublimate it with great labour, is labour in vain, since it involves
a dissipation of Sol and Luna existing therein. There is another method,
far different and much more concise, whereby, with little waste of Mercury
and less expenditure of toil, it is transmuted into Luna without congelation.
Any one can at pleasure learn this Art in Alchemy, since it is so simple
and easy; and by it, in a short time, he could make any quantity of silver
and gold. It is tedious to read long descriptions, and everybody wishes
to be advised in straightforward words. Do this, then; proceed as follows,
and you will have Sol and Luna, by help whereof you will turn out a very
rich man. Wait awhile, I beg, while this process is described to you in
few words, and keep these words well digested, so that out of Saturn, Mercury,
and Jupiter you may make Sol and Luna. There is not, nor ever will be,
any art so easy to find out and practise, and so effective in itself. The
method of making Sol and Luna by Alchemy is so prompt that there is no
more need of books, or of elaborate instruction, than there would be if
one wished to write about last year's snow.
<center>
<p><b>Concerning the Receipts of Alchemy</b>.</center>

<p>What, then, shall we say about the receipts of Alchemy, and about the
diversity of its vessels and instruments? These are furnaces, glasses,
jars, waters, oils, limes, sulphurs, salts, saltpetres, alums, vitriols,
chrysocollae, copper-greens, atraments, auri-pigments, fel vitri, ceruse,
red earth, thucia, wax, lutum sapientiae, pounded glass, verdigris, soot,
testae ovorum, crocus of Mars, soap, crystal, chalk, <b>arsenic</b>, antimony,
minium, elixir, lazurium, gold-leaf, salt-nitre, sal ammoniac, calamine
stone, magnesia, bolus armenus, and many other things. Moreover, concerning
preparations, putrefactions, digestions, probations, solutions, cementings,
filtrations, reverberations, calcinations, graduations, rectifications,
amalgamations, purgations, etc., with these alchemical books are crammed.
Then, again, concerning herbs, roots, seeds, woods, stones, animals, worms,
bone dust, snail shells, other shells, and pitch. These and the like, whereof
there are some very far-fetched in Alchemy, are mere incumbrances of work;
since even if Sol and Luna could be made by them they rather hinder and
delay than further one’s purpose. But it is not from these --- to say the
truth --- that the Art of making Sol and Luna is to be learnt. So, then,
all these things should be passed by, because they have no effect with
the five metals, so far as Sol and Luna are concerned. Someone may ask,
What, then, is this short and easy way, which involves no difficulty, and
yet whereby Sol and Luna can be made? Our answer is, this has been fully
and openly explained in the Seven Canons. It would be lost labour should
one seek further to instruct one who does not understand these. It would
be impossible to convince such a person that these matters could be so
easily understood, but in an occult rather than in an open sense.
<p><b>The Art is This</b>: After you have made heaven, or the sphere of
Saturn, with its life to run over the earth, place on it all the planets,
or such, one or more, as you wish, so that the portion of Luna may be the
smallest. Let all run, until heaven, or Saturn, has entirely disappeared.
Then all those planets will remain dead with their old corruptible bodies,
having meanwhile obtained another new, perfect, and incorruptible body.
<p>That body is the spirit of heaven. From it these planets again receive
a body and life, and live as before. Take this body from the life and the
earth. Keep it. It is Sol and Luna. Here you have the Art altogether, clear
and entire. If you do not yet understand it, or are not practised therein,
it is well. It is better that it should be kept concealed, and not made
public.
<center>
<p><b>How to Conjure the Crystal so that All Things may be Seen in It.</b></center>

<p>To conjure is nothing else than to observe anything rightly, to know
and to understand what it is. The crystal is a figure of the air. Whatever
appears in the air, movable or immovable, the same appears also in the
speculum or crystal as a wave. For the air, the water, and the crystal,
so far as vision is concerned, are one, like a mirror in which an inverted
copy of an object is seen.
<center>
<p><b>Concerning the Heat of Mercury</b>.</center>

<p>Those who think that Mercury is of a moist and cold nature are plainly
in error, because it is by its nature in the highest degree warm and moist,
which is the cause of its being in a constant state of fluidity. If it
were of a moist and cold nature it would have the appearance of frozen
water, and be always hard and solid, so that it would be necessary to liquefy
it by the heat of fire, as in the case of the other metals. But it does
not require this, since it has liquidity and flux from its own heat naturally
inborn in it, which keeps it in a state of perpetual fluidity and renders
it "quick", so that it can neither die, nor be coagulated, nor congealed.
And this is well worth noticing, that the spirits of the seven metals,
or as many of them as have been commingled, as soon as they come into the
fire, contend with one another, especially Mercury, so that each may put
forth its powers and virtues in the endeavour to get the mastery in the
way of liquefying and transmuting. One seizes on the virtue, life, and
form of another, and assigns some other nature and form to this one. So
then the spirits or vapours of the metals are stirred up by the heat to
operate mutually one upon the other, and transmute from one virtue to another,
until perfection and purity are attained.
<p>But what must be done besides to Mercury in order that its moisture
and heat may be taken away, and in their place such an extreme cold introduced
as to congeal, consolidate, and altogether mortify the Mercury? Do what
follows in the sentence subjoined: Take pure Mercury closely shut up in
a silver pixis. Fill a jar with fragments of lead, in the midst of which
place the pixis. Let it melt for twenty-four hours, that is, for a natural
day. This takes away from Mercury his occult heat, adds an external heat,
and contributes the internal coldness of Saturn and Luna (which are both
planets of a cold nature), whence and whereby the Mercury is compelled
to congeal, consolidate, and harden.
<p>Note also that the coldness (which Mercury needs in its consolidation
and mortification) is not perceptible by the external sense, as the cold
of snow or of ice is, but rather, externally, there is a certain amount
of apparent heat. Just in the same way is it with the heat of Mercury,
which is the cause of its fluidity. It is not an external heat, perceptible
in the same way as one of our qualities. Nay, externally a sort of coldness
is perceptible. Whence the Sophists (a race which has more talk than true
wisdom) falsely assert that Mercury is cold and of a moist nature, so that
they go on and advise us to congeal it by means of heat; whereas heat only
renders it more fluid, as they daily find out to their own loss rather
than gain.
<p>True Alchemy which alone, by its unique Art, teaches how to fabricate
Sol and Luna from the five imperfect metals, allows no other receipt than
this, which well and truly says: Only from metals, in metals, by metals,
and with metals, are perfect metals made, for in some things is Luna and
in other metals is Sol.

<p><b>What Materials and Instruments are Required in Alchemy</b>.</center>

<p>There is need of nothing else but a foundry, bellows, tongs, hammers,
cauldrons, jars, and cupels made from beechen ashes. Afterwards, lay on
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna. Let them operate
finally up to Saturn.

<p><b>The Method of Seeking Minerals</b>.</center>

<p>The hope of finding these in the earth and in stones is most uncertain,
and the labour very great. However, since this is the first mode of getting
them, it is in no way to be despised, but greatly commended. Such a desire
or appetite ought no more to be done away with than the lawful inclination
of young people, and those in the prime of life, to matrimony. As the bees
long for roses and other flowers for the purpose of making honey and wax,
so, too, men – apart from avarice or their own aggrandisement --- should
seek to extract metal from the earth. He who does not seek it is not likely
to find it. God dowers men not only with gold or silver, but also with
poverty, squalor, and misery. He has given to some a singular knowledge
of metals and minerals, whereby they have obtained an easier and shorter
method of fabricating gold and silver, without digging and smelting them,
than they were commonly accustomed to, by extracting them from their primitive
bodies. And this is the case not only with subterranean substances, but
by certain arts and knowledge they have extracted them from the five metals
generally (that is to say, from metals excocted from minerals which are
imperfect and called metals), viz., from Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars
and Venus, from all of which, and from each of them separately, Sol and
Luna can be made, but from one more easily than from another. Note, that
Sol and Luna can be made easily from Mercury, Saturn, and Jupiter, but
from Mars and Venus with difficulty. It is possible to make them, however,
but with the addition of Sol and Luna. Out of Magnesium and Saturn comes
Luna, and out of Jupiter and Cinnabar pure Sol takes its rise. The skilful
artist, however (how well I remember!), will be able by diligent consideration
to prepare metals so that, led by a true method of reasoning, he can promote
the perfection of metallic transformation more than do the courses of the
twelve signs and the seven planets. In such matters it is quite superfluous
to watch these courses, as also their aspects, good or bad days or hours,
the prosperous or unlucky condition of this or that planet, for these matters
can do no good, and much less can they do harm in the art of natural Alchemy.
If otherwise, and you have a feasible process, operate when you please.
If, however, there be anything wanting in you or your mode of working,
or your understanding, the planets and the stars of heaven will fail you
in your work.
<p>If metals remain buried long enough in the earth, not only are they
consumed by rust, but by long continuance they are even transmuted into
natural stones, and there are a great many of these; but this is known
to few. For there is found in the earth old stone money of the heathens,
printed with their different figures. These coins were originally metallic,
but through the transmutation brought about by Nature, they were turned
into stone.

<p><b>What Alchemy Is</b>.</center>

<p>Alchemy is nothing else but the set purpose, intention, and subtle endeavour
to transmute the kinds of the metals from one to another.<sup>10</sup>
According to this, each person, by his own mental grasp, can choose out
for himself a better way and Art, and therein find truth, for the man who
follows a thing up more intently does find the truth. It is highly necessary
to have a correct estimation of stars and of stones, because the star is
the informing spirit of all stones. For the Sol and Luna of all the celestial
stars are nothing but one stone in itself; and the terrestrial stone has
come forth from the celestial stone; through the same fire, coals, ashes,
the same expulsions and repurgations as that celestial stone, it has been
separated and brought, clear and pure in its brightness. The whole ball
of the earth is only something thrown off, concrete, mixed, corrupted,
ground, and again coagulated, and gradually liquefied into one mass, into
a stony work, which has its seat and its rest in the midst of the firmamental
sphere.
<p>Further it is to be remarked that those precious stones which shall
forth-with be set down have the nearest place to the heavenly or sidereal
ones in point of perfection, purity, beauty, brightness, virtue, power
of withstanding fire, and incorruptibility, and they have been fixed with
other stones in the earth.
<p>They have, therefore, the greatest affinity with heavenly stones and
with the stars, because their natures are derived from these. They are
found by men in a rude environment, and the common herd (whose property
it is to take false views of things) believe that they were produced in
the same place where they are found, and that they were afterwards polished,
carried around, and sold, and accounted to be great riches, on account
of their colours, beauty, and other virtues. A brief description of them
follows:
<p><i>The Emerald.</i> This is a green transparent stone. It does good
to the eyes and the memory. It defends chastity; and if this be violated
by him who carries it, the stone itself does not remain perfect.
<p><i>The Adamant</i>. A black crystal called Adamant or else Evax, on
account of the joy which it is effectual in impressing on those who carry
it. It is of an obscure and transparent blackness, the colour of iron.
It is the hardest of all; but is dissolved in the blood of a goat. Its
size at the largest does not exceed that of a hazel nut.
<p><i>The Magnet</i> Is an iron stone, and so attracts iron to itself.
<p><i>The Pearl</i>. The Pearl is not a stone, because it is produced in
sea shells. It is of a white colour. Seeing that it grows in animated beings,
in men or in fishes, it is not properly of a stony nature, but properly
a depraved (otherwise a transmuted) nature supervening upon a perfect work.
<p><i>The Jacinth</i> Is a yellow, transparent stone. There is a flower
of the same name which, according to the fable of the poets, is said to
have been a man.
<p><i>The Sapphire</i> Is a stone of a celestial colour and a heavenly
nature.
<p><i>The Ruby</i> Shines with an intensely red nature.
<p><i>The Carbuncle</i>. A solar stone, shining by its own nature like
the sun.
<p><i>The Coral</i> Is a white or red stone, not transparent. It grows
in the sea, out of the nature of the water and the air, into the form of
wood or a shrub; it hardens in the air, and is not capable of being destroyed
in fire.
<p><i>The Chalcedony</i> Is a stone made up of different colours, occupying
a middle place between obscurity and transparency, mixed also with cloudiness,
and liver coloured. It is the lowest of all the precious stones.
<p><i>The Topaz</i> Is a stone shining by night. It is found among rocks.
<p><i>The Amethyst</i> Is a stone of a purple and blood colour.
<p><i>The Chrysoprasus</i> Is a stone which appears like fire by night,
and like gold by day.
<p><i>The Crystal</i> Is a white stone, transparent, and very like ice.
It is sublimated, extracted, and produced from other stones.
<p>As a pledge and firm foundation of this matter, note the following conclusion.
If anyone intelligently and reasonably takes care to exercise himself in
learning about the metals, what they are, and whence they are produced:
he may know that our metals are nothing else than the best part and the
spirit of common stones, that is, pitch, grease, fat, oil, and stone. But
this is least pure, uncontaminated, and perfect, so long as it remains
hidden or mixed with the stones. It should therefore be sought and found
in the stones, be recognised in them, and extracted from them, that is,
forcibly drawn out and liquefied. For then it is no longer a stone, but
an elaborate and perfect metal, comparable to the stars of heaven, which
are themselves, as it were, stones separated from those of earth.
<p>Whoever, therefore, studies minerals and metals must be furnished with
such reason and intelligence that he shall not regard only those common
and known metals which are found in the depth of the mountains alone. For
there is often found at the very surface of the earth such a metal as is
not met with at all, or not equally good, in the depths. And so every stone
which comes to our view, be it great or small, flint or simple rock, should
be carefully investigated and weighed with a true balance, according to
its nature and properties. Very often a common stone, thrown away and despised,
is worth more than a cow. Regard must not always be had to the place of
digging from which this stone came forth; for here the influence of the
sky prevails. Everywhere there is presented to us earth, or dust, or sand,
which often contain much gold or silver, and this you will mark.
