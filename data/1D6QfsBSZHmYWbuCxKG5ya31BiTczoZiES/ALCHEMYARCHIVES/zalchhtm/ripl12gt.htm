<br><b><font size=+1>Calcination</font></b></center>

<p>Calcination is the purgation of our stone,
<br>And restoration also of its natural heat.
<br>Of radical humidity it looseth none,
<br>Inducing solution into our stone most mete.
<br>Seek after philosophy I you advise
<br>But not after the common guise,
<br>With sulphur and salts prepared in diverse ways.
<p>Neither with corrosives, nor with fire alone,
<br>Nor with vinegar, nor with ardent water,
<br>Neither with the vapour of lead,
<br>Our stone is calcined according to our intent.
<br>All those who to calcining so be bent,
<br>From this hard science withdraw their hand,
<br>Till they our calcining better understand.
<p>For by such calcining, their bodies will be spoiled,
<br>For it diminishes the moisture of our stone.
<br>Therefore when bodies to powder be burnt,
<br>Dry as ashes of tree or bone,
<br>Of such calxes then will we will have none,
<br>For moisture we multiply radical,
<br>In our calcining, diminishing none at all.
<p>And for a sure ground of our true calcination,
<br>Work wisely only kind with kind.
<br>For kind to kind has appetite and inclination.
<br>He who does not know this, in knowledge is blind,
<br>And may wander forth as mist in the wind,
<br>Knowing never with profit where to alight,
<br>Because he conceives not our words aright.
<p>Join kind to kind therefore as reason is,
<br>For as every young shoot answers its own seed,
<br>Man begets man, a beast a beast, likewise,
<br>Further to treat of this there is no need.
<br>But understand this point if you will succeed,
<br>Each thing is first calcined in its own kind,
<br>This well concealed fruit therein shall you find.
<p>And we make calx unctuous both white and red,
<br>Of three degrees or our base be perfect,
<br>Fluxible as wax, else stand they in little stead.
<br>By right long process as philosophers do write,
<br>A year we take or more for our respite.
<br>For in less space our calxes will not be made,
<br>Able to tinge with colour that will not fade.
<p>And for thy proportions you must beware,
<br>For therein may you be beguiled.
<br>Therefore so that your work will not be marred,
<br>Let your body be subtly filled with Mercury,
<br>As much then so subtiled,
<br>One of the Sun, two of the Moon,
<br>Till altogether like pap be done.
<p>Then make the Mercury four to the Sun,
<br>Two to the Moon as it should be,
<br>And thus your work must be begun,
<br>In figure of the Trinity,
<br>Three of the body and of the spirit three,
<br>And for the unity of the substance spiritual,
<br>One more than of the substance corporeal.
<p>By Raymond's repertory this is true Proportion,
<br>There who choose to look.
<br>The same my Doctor did show to me,
<br>But three of the spirit Bacon took,
<br>To one of the body,
<br>For which I lay awake many a night before I knew it.
<br>And both be true, take which you choose.
<p>If the water also be equal in proportion to the earth,
<br>With heat in due measure,
<br>From them shall spring a new young shoot,
<br>Both white and red in pure tincture,
<br>Which in the fire shall ever endure.
<br>Kill you the quick, the dead revive;
<br>Make trinity unity without any strife.
<p>This is the surest and best proportion,
<br>For where is least of the part spiritual,
<br>The better therefore shall be solution,
<br>Than if you did it swell with water,
<br>Your earth overglutting which loses all,
<br>Take heed therefore to the potter's loam,
<br>And make you never too wet your womb.
<p>That loam behold how it is tempered,
<br>The mean also how it is calcinated,
<br>And ever look you bear this in mind,
<br>That never your earth with water be suffocated.
<br>Dry up your moisture with heat most temperate,
<br>Help Dissolution with moisture of the Moon,
<br>And Congelation with the Sun, then you have done.
<p>Four natures into the fifth so shall you turn,
<br>Which is a nature most perfect and temperate,
<br>But hard it is with your bare foot to spurn,
<br>Against a bar of iron, or steel newly sharpened,
<br>For many do so which be infatuated,
<br>When they such high things take in hand,
<br>Which they in no way do understand.
<p>In eggs, in vitriol, or in blood,
<br>What riches they go there to find.
<br>If they Philosophy understood,
<br>They would not in working be so blind,
<br>To seek Gold and Silver out of their kind.
<br>For like as fire is of the burning principle,
<br>So is the principle of gilding likewise.
<p>If you intend therefore to make,
<br>Gold and Silver by craft of our philosophy,
<br>Take neither eggs nor blood,
<br>But Gold and Silver which naturally Calcined,
<br>Wisely and not manually,
<br>A new generation will be brought forth,
<br>Increasing their kind as does everything.
<p>And if it were true that profit might be,
<br>In things which are not metalline,
<br>In which be colours pleasant to see,
<br>As in blood, eggs, hair, urine or wine,
<br>Or in mean minerals dug out of the mine,
<br>Yet must that element be putrefied and separated,
<br>And with elements of perfect bodies be disposed.
<p>But first make rotation of these elements,
<br>And into water your earth turn first of all,
<br>Then of your water make air by levitation,
<br>And air make fire, then I will call you a Master,
<br>Of all our secrets great and small.
<br>The wheel of Elements then you can turn about,
<br>Truly understanding our writings without doubt.
<p>This done, go backwards, turning the wheel again,
<br>And presently turn your fire into water,
<br>Air into earth, else you will labour in vain.
<br>For so to temperament is brought our stone,
<br>And Nature's contractions, four are made one,
<br>After they have three times been circulated,
<br>And also your base is perfectly consummated.
<p>This under the moisture of the Moon,
<br>And under the temperate heat of the Sun,
<br>Your Elements shall be incinerated soon,
<br>And then you have the mastery won.
<br>Thank God your work was then so begun,
<br>For there you have one true token,
<br>Which first in blackness will be shown to you.
<p>That token we call the Head of the Crow,
<br>And some men call it the Crow's bill,
<br>Some call it the ashes of Hermes tree,
<br>And thus they name it after their will,
<br>Our Toad which eats his fill of the earth,
<br>Some name it by that which it is mortified,
<br>The spirit with venom intoxicated.
<p>But it has an infinity of names, I say,
<br>For it is named after each thing that is seen to be black,
<br>Till the time it waxes white,
<br>Then it has names of more delight,
<br>Called after all things that be full white,
<br>And the red likewise after the same,
<br>Of all red things does take the name,
<p>You are now within the first gate,
<br>Of the Castle where the Philosophers dwell.
<br>Proceed wisely that you may win,
<br>And go though more gates of that Castle.
<br>This Castle is round as any bell,
<br>And gates it has yet eleven more,
<br>One is conquered, now to the second go.
<p>The end of the First Gate.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Second Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Solution</font></b></center>

<p>Now I will speak a word or two of Solution,
<br>Which reveals what ere was hid from sight,
<br>And makes thin, things that were thick,
<br>By virtue of our first menstruum clear and bright,
<br>In which our bodies have been eclipsed from light,
<br>And of their hard and dry compaction subtilated,
<br>Into their own first matter kindly retrogradated.
<p>One in gender they be, and in number two,
<br>Whose father is the Sun, the Moon the mother,
<br>Mercury moves between,
<br>These and no more be our Magnesia, our Adrop,
<br>And no other things be here, but only sister and brother,
<br>That is to mean, agent and patient,
<br>Sulphur and Mercury, co-essential to our intent.
<p>Betwixt these two, equally contrary,
<br>Engendered is our mean most marvellous,
<br>Which is our Mercury and unctuous menstrum,
<br>Our secret Sulphur working invisibly,
<br>More fiercely than fire burning the body,
<br>Dissolving the body into mineral water,
<br>Which we do call night or darkness in the North.
<p>But yet I trust, you understand not utterly,
<br>The very secret of the Philosopher's Dissolution.
<br>Therefore understand me, I counsel you wisely,
<br>For the truth I will tell you without delusion,
<br>Our Solution is cause of our Congelation,
<br>For Dissolution on the one side corporeal,
<br>Causes Congelation on the other side spiritual.
<p>And we dissolve into water which wets no hand,
<br>For when the earth is integrally incinerated,
<br>Then is the water congealed; this understand,
<br>For the elements be so together concatenated,
<br>That when the body is from his first form altered,
<br>A new form is induced immediately,
<br>For nothing is without form utterly.
<p>And here a secret I will disclose to you,
<br>Which is the ground unto our secrets all,
<br>Which if you do not know you shall but lose,
<br>Thy labour and costs both great and small.
<br>Take heed therefore that in error you not fall,
<br>The more your earth, and the less your water be,
<br>The rather and better solution shall you see.
<p>Behold how ice to water does relent,
<br>And so it must, for water it was before,
<br>Right so again to water our earth is gone,
<br>And water thereby congealed for evermore.
<br>For after all Philosophers that ever were born,
<br>Each metal was once mineral water,
<br>Therefore with water they turn to water all.
<p>In which water of kind occassionate,
<br>Of qualities been repugnant and diversity.
<br>Things into things must therefore be rotated,
<br>Until diversity be brought to perfect unity.
<br>For Scripture records when the earth shall be troubled,
<br>And into the deep sea shall be cast,
<br>Mountains and bodies likewise at the last.
<p>Our bodies be likened conveniently to mountains,
<br>Which after high Planets we name,
<br>Into the deepness therefore of Mercury,
<br>Turn them, and keep you out of blame,
<br>For then you shall see a noble game,
<br>How all shall become powder as soft as silk,
<br>So does our rennet kindly curd our milk.
<p>Then have the bodies lost their first form,
<br>And others been induced immediately,
<br>Then you have well bestowed your cost,
<br>Whereas others uncunningly must go by,
<br>Not knowing the secrets of our Philosophy.
<br>Yet one point more I must tell thee,
<br>How each body has dimensions three.
<p>Altitude, Latitude and also Profundity,
<br>By which always we must turn our wheel,
<br>Knowing that your entrance in the West shall be,
<br>Your passage forth to the North if you do well,
<br>And there your lights lose their light each deal,
<br>For there you must abide by ninety nights,
<br>In darkness of purgatory without lights.
<p>Then take your course up to the East anon,
<br>By colours variable, passing in manifold ways,
<br>And then be winter and spring nigh overgone,
<br>To the East therefore devise your ascending,
<br>For there the Sun with daylight does uprise in summer,
<br>And there disport you with delight,
<br>For there your work shall become perfect white.
<p>Forth from the East into the South ascend,
<br>And sit you down there in the chair of fire,
<br>For there is harvest, that is to say an end
<br>Of all this work after your own desire,
<br>There shines the Sun up in his Hemisphere,
<br>And after the eclipse is in redness with glory,
<br>To reign as King upon all metals and Mercury.
<p>All in one glass must all this thing be done,
<br>Like to an egg in shape and closed well,
<br>Then you must know the measure of firing,
<br>Which if unknown your work is lost each deal.
<br>Never let your glass be hotter than you may feel,
<br>And suffer still in your bare hand to hold,
<br>For fear of losing, as Philosophers have told.
<p>Yet to my doctrine futhermore attend,
<br>Beware your glass you never open nor move,
<br>From the beginning until you have made an end,
<br>If you do otherwise, your work may never achieve,
<br>Thus in this Chapter, which is but brief,
<br>I have taught you your true Solution,
<br>Now to the third gate go, for this is won.
<p>The end of the second gate
<p>

<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;The Third Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Separation</font></b></center>

<p>Separation does each part from the other divide,
<br>The subtle from the gross, the thick from the thin,
<br>But look you set aside manual Separation,
<br>For that pertains to fools that little good do win,
<br>But in our Separation Nature does not cease,
<br>Making division of qualities elemental,
<br>Into a fifth degree till they be turned all.
<p>Earth is turned into water black and blue,
<br>And water after into air under very white,
<br>Then air into fire, elements there be no more,
<br>Of these is made our stone of great delight,
<br>But of this Separation much more must we write,
<br>And Separation is called by Philosophers definition,
<br>Tetraptative dispersion of the said four elements.
<p>Of this Separation I find a like figure,
<br>Spoken by the prophet in the psalmody,
<br>God brought out of a stone a flood of water pure,
<br>And out of the hardest rock oil abundantly,
<br>So out of our precious stone if you be wise,
<br>Oil incombustible and water you shall draw,
<br>And thereabouts you need not at the coals to blow.
<p>Do this with heat easy and nourishing,
<br>First with moist fire and after that with dry,
<br>Drawing out the phlegm with patience,
<br>And after that the other Natures wisely,
<br>Dry up thine earth till it be thirsty,
<br>By Calcination, else you labour in vain,
<br>And then make it drink up the moisture again.
<p>Thus you must oftentimes make Separation,
<br>Dividing your waters into two parts,
<br>So that the subtle from the gross you take,
<br>Till the earth remain below in colour blue,
<br>That earth is fixed to abide all woe,
<br>The other part is spiritual and flying,
<br>But you must turn them all into one thing.
<p>Then oil and water with water shall distil,
<br>And through its help receive moving,
<br>Keep well these two that you not spoil,
<br>Your work for lack of due closing,
<br>And make your stopple of glass,
<br>Melting the top of your vessel together with it,
<br>Then Philosopher-like it is shut up.
<p>The water wherewith you may revive the stone,
<br>Look you distil before you work with it,
<br>Oftentimes by itself alone,
<br>And by this sight you shall well know,
<br>When it is quit from feculent faeces,
<br>For some men can it with Saturn multiply,
<br>And other substances which we defy.
<p>Distil it therefore till it be clean,
<br>And thin like water as it should be,
<br>As heaven in colour bright and shine,
<br>Keeping both figure and ponderosity,
<br>Therewith did Hermes moisten his tree,
<br>Within his glass he made it grow upright,
<br>With flowers coloured beautiful to sight.
<p>This water is like to the venomous Tyre,
<br>Wherewith the mighty miracle is wrought,
<br>For it is a poison most strong of ire,
<br>A stronger poison cannot be thought,
<br>At apothecaries therefore it is often sought,
<br>But no man shall be intoxicated by it,
<br>From the time it is elixerated into medicine.
<p>For then it is the miracle true,
<br>It is of poison most expulsive,
<br>And in its workings does marvels show,
<br>Preserving many from death to life,
<br>But look you meddle it with no corrosive,
<br>But choose it pure and quick running,
<br>If thou thereby will have winning.
<p>It is a marvellous thing in kind,
<br>And without it nothing can be done,
<br>Therefore did Hermes call it his wind,
<br>For it flies up from Sun and Moon,
<br>And makes our stone to fly with it soon,
<br>Reviving the dead and giving life,
<br>To Sun and Moon, husband and wife.
<p>Which if they were not by craft made quick,
<br>And their fatness with water drawn out,
<br>So the thin was severed from the thick,
<br>You should never bring this work about,
<br>If you will speed therefore without doubt,
<br>Raise up the birds out of their nest,
<br>And after again bring them to rest.
<p>Water with water will accord and ascend,
<br>And spirit with spirit, for they be of one kind,
<br>Which after they be exalted make to descend,
<br>So shall you divide that which Nature formerly did bind,
<br>Mercury essential turning into wind,
<br>Without which natural and subtle Separation,
<br>May never complete profitable generation.
<p>Now to help you in at this gate,
<br>The last secret I will tell to you,
<br>Your water must be sublimated seven times,
<br>Else no kindly Dissolution shall be,
<br>And you shall not see putrefying,
<br>Like liquid pitch, nor colours appearing,
<br>For lack of fire working within your glass.
<p>There are four fires which you must understand,
<br>Natural, unnatural, against Nature also,
<br>And elemental which does burn the brand.
<br>These four fires we use and no more,
<br>Fire against nature must do your bodily woe,
<br>This is our Dragon as I you tell,
<br>Fiercely burning as the fire of hell.
<p>Fire of nature is the third menstrual,
<br>That fire is natural in each thing,
<br>But fire occasional, we call unnatural,
<br>As heat of ashes, and baths for putrefying,
<br>Without these fires you may nought bring to Putrefaction,
<br>For to be separate,
<br>Your matters together proportionate.
<p>Therefore make fire within your glass,
<br>Which burns the body more than fire Elemental,
<br>If you will win our secrets,
<br>According to your desire.
<br>Then shall your seeds both rot and spire,
<br>By help of fire occasional,
<br>That kindly after they may be separated.
<p>Of Separation the Gate must thus be won,
<br>That furthermore yet you may proceed,
<br>Towards the Gate of secret Conjunction,
<br>Into the inner Castle which will you lead,
<br>Do after my counsel if you will speed,
<br>With two strong locks this Gate is shut,
<br>As consequently you shall well know.
<p>The end of the Third Gate.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Fourth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Conjunction</font></b></center>

<p>After the chapter of natural Separation,
<br>By which the elements of our Stone be dissevered,
<br>Here follows the chapter of secret Conjunction,
<br>Which Natures repugnant joins to perfect unity.
<br>And so them knitteth that none from the other may flee,
<br>When they by fire shall be examined,
<br>They be together so surely conjugated.
<p>And therefore Philosophers give this definition,
<br>Saying this Conjunction is nothing else,
<br>But a copulation of dissevered qualities,
<br>Or a co-equation of principles, as others tell,
<br>But some men with Mercury that the Apothecary sells,
<br>Meld bodies which cannot divide their matter,
<br>And therefore they slip aside.
<p>For until the time the soul be separated,
<br>And cleansed from its original sin with the water,
<br>And thoroughly spiritualised,
<br>The true Conjunction you may never begin.
<br>Therefore the soul first from the body twin,
<br>Then of the corporeal part and of the spiritual.
<br>The soul shall cause perpetual conjunction.
<p>Of two conjunctions the philosophers do mention make,
<br>Gross when the body with Mercury is reincrudate,
<br>But let this pass, and to the second take heed,
<br>Which is as I have said, after separation celebrated,
<br>In which the parties be left with least to colligate,
<br>And so promoted unto a most perfect temperance,
<br>That never after amongst them may be repugnance.
<p>Thus Separation causes true Conjunction to be had,
<br>Of water and air, with earth and fire,
<br>But that each element into other may be laid,
<br>And so abide for ever to your desire,
<br>Do as do daubers with clay or mire,
<br>Temper them thick and make them not too thin,
<br>So do updrying, you shall the rather win.
<p>But manners there be of our Conjunction three,
<br>The first is called Diptative by Philosophers,
<br>Which between the agent and patient must be,
<br>Male and female, Mercury and Sulphur vive,
<br>Matter and form, thin and thick to thrive,
<br>This lesson will help thee without any doubt,
<br>And our Conjunction truly to bring about.
<p>The second manner is called Triptative,
<br>Which is Conjunction, made of things three,
<br>Of body, soul and spirit, that they not strive,
<br>Which trinity you must bring to unity,
<br>For as the soul to the spirit must bonded be,
<br>So the body must the soul to him knit,
<br>Out of thy mind let not this lesson flit.
<p>The third manner and also the last of all,
<br>Four Elements together which join to abide,
<br>Tetraptative certainly the Philosophers do call it,
<br>And especially Guido de Montano whose fame goes wide,
<br>And therefore in most laudable manner this tide,
<br>In our Conjunction four elements must aggregate in due proportion,
<br>Which first were separated asunder.
<p>Therefore like as the woman has veins fifteen,
<br>And the man has but five to the act of their fecundity,
<br>Required in our Conjunction first I mean,
<br>So must the man our Sun have of his water three,
<br>And nine his wife, which three to him must be.
<br>Then like with like will joy have for to dwell,
<br>More of Conjunction I needeth not to tell.
<p>This chapter I will conclude right soon,
<br>Therefore gross Conjunction charging thee to make but one,
<br>For seldom have strumpets children of them bore,
<br>And so you shall never come by our stone,
<br>Without you let the woman lie alone,
<br>That after she has once conceived of the man,
<br>Her matrix be shut up from all others then.
<p>For such as add ever more crude to crude,
<br>Opening their vessel letting their matters cool,
<br>The sperm conceived they nourish not but delude themselves,
<br>And spoil their work each time.
<br>If you therefore wish to do well,
<br>Close up your matrix and nourish the seed,
<br>With continual and temperate heat if you will speed.
<p>And when your vessel has stood by five months,
<br>And clouds and eclipses be passed each one,
<br>The light appearing, increase your heat, then believe,
<br>Until bright and shining in whiteness be your Stone.
<br>Then may you open your glass anon,
<br>And feed your child which is born,
<br>With milk and meat, aye more and more.
<p>For now both moist and dry is so contemperated,
<br>That of the water earth has received impression,
<br>Which never after that asunder may be separate,
<br>So water to earth has given ingression,
<br>That both together to dwell have made profession,
<br>And water of earth has purchased a retinue,
<br>They four made one never more to strive.
<p>Thus in two things all our intent does hang,
<br>In dry and moist, which are two contraries.
<br>In dry, that it bring the moist to fixing,
<br>In moist, that it give liquefaction to the earth also,
<br>That of them a temperament may thus go forth,
<br>A temperament not so thick as the body is,
<br>Neither so thin as water without miss.
<p>Loosing and knitting thereof be two principles,
<br>Of this hard science, and poles most principal,
<br>How be it that other principles be many more,
<br>As shining fanes which I shall show,
<br>Proceed therefore unto another wall,
<br>Of this strong Castle of our Wisdom,
<br>That in at the fifth Gate you may come.
<p>The end of the Fourth Gate.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">

<p><b><font size=+1>The Fifth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Putrefaction</font></b></center>

<p>Now we begin the chapter of Putrefaction,
<br>Without which pole no seed may multiply,
<br>Which must be done only by continual action,
<br>Of heat in the body, moist not manually.
<br>For bodies else may not be altered naturally,
<br>Since Christ doth witness, unless the grain of wheat die in the ground,
<br>Increase may thou not get.
<p>And likewise unless the matter putrefy,
<br>It may in no way truly be altered,
<br>Neither may thy elements be divided kindly,
<br>Nor the conjunction of them perfectly celebrated,
<br>That thy labour therefore be not frustrated,
<br>The privitie of our putrefying well understand,
<br>Before ever you take this work in hand.
<p>And Putrefaction may thus be defined, after philosophers sayings,
<br>To be the slaying of bodies,
<br>And in our compound a division of things three,
<br>Leading forth into the corruption of killed bodies,
<br>And after enabling them unto regeneration,
<br>For things being in the earth, without doubt,
<br>Be engendered of rotation in the heavens about.
<p>And therefore as I have said before,
<br>Thine elements commixed and wisely coequate,
<br>Thou keep in temperate heat,
<br>Eschewing evermore that they be not incinerate by violent heat,
<br>To dry powder, unprofitably rubificated,
<br>But into powder black as a crow's bill,
<br>With heat of the Bath or else of our dunghill.
<p>Until the time that ninety nights be passed,
<br>In moist heat keep them for any thing,
<br>Soon after by blackness you shall espy,
<br>That they draw close to putrefying,
<br>Which after many colours you shall bring,
<br>With patience easily to perfect whiteness,
<br>And so thy seed in his nature will multiply.
<p>Make each the other then to hug and kiss,
<br>And like as children to play them up and down,
<br>And when their shirts are filled with piss,
<br>Then let the woman to wash be bound,
<br>Which often for faintness will fall in a swoon,
<br>And die at last with her children all,
<br>And go to purgatory to purge their filth original.
<p>When they be there, by little and little increase,
<br>Their pains with heat, aye, more and more,
<br>Never let the fire from them cease,
<br>And see that thy furnace be apt therefore,
<br>Which wise men call an Athanor,
<br>Conserving heat required most temperately,
<br>By which thy matter doth kindly putrefy.
<p>Of this principle speaks wise Guido,
<br>And sayeth "by rotting dieth the compound corporeal",
<br>And then after Morien and others more,
<br>Upriseth again regenerated, simple and spiritual,
<br>And were not heat and moisture continual,
<br>Sperm in the womb might have no abiding,
<br>And so there should be no fruit thereof upspring.
<p>Therefore at the beginning our stone thou take,
<br>And bury each one in other within their grave,
<br>Then equally between them a marriage make,
<br>To lie together six weeks let them have their seed conceived,
<br>Kindly to nourish and save,
<br>From the ground of their grave not rising that while,
<br>Which secret point doth many a one beguile.
<p>This time of conception with easy heat abide,
<br>The blackness showing shall tell you when they die,
<br>For they together like liquid pitch that tide,
<br>Shall swell and bubble, settle and putrefy,
<br>Shining colours therein you shall espy,
<br>Like to the rainbow marvellous to sight,
<br>The Water then beginneth to dry upright.
<p>For in moist bodies, heat working temperate,
<br>Engenders blackness first of all,
<br>Which is the assigned token of kindly Conjunction,
<br>And of true Putrefaction: remember this,
<br>For then perfectly to alter thou can not miss,
<br>And thus by the gate of blackness thou must come in,
<br>To light of Paradise in whiteness if you wilt win.
<p>For first the Sun in his uprising shall be obscured,
<br>And pass the waters of Noah's flood on earth,
<br>Which was continued a hundred and fifty days,
<br>Ere this water went away,
<br>Right so our waters shall pass (as wise men understood),
<br>That you with David shall say,
<br>"Abierunt in sicco flumina" : bear this away.
<p>Soon after that Noah planted his vineyard,
<br>Which royally flourished and brought forth grapes,
<br>After which space you shall not be afraid,
<br>For it likewise shall follow the nourishing of our stone,
<br>And soon after that 30 days be gone,
<br>You shall have grapes right as ruby red,
<br>Which is our Adrop, our Ucifer, and our red lead.
<p>For like as souls after pains transitory,
<br>Be brought to Paradise, which ever is joyful life,
<br>So shall our stone after his darkness in Purgatory be purged,
<br>And joined in Elements without strife,
<br>Rejoice the whiteness and beauty of his wife,
<br>And pass from darkness of purgatory to light of Paradise,
<br>In whiteness Elixir of great might.
<p>And that you may the rather to putrefaction win,
<br>This example take you for a true conclusion,
<br>For all the secret of Putrefaction rests therein,
<br>The heart of oak that hath of water continual infusion,
<br>Will not soon putrefy, I tell you without delusion,
<br>For though it lay in water a hundred years and more,
<br>Yet should you find it sound as ere it was before.
<p>But if you keep it sometimes wet and sometimes dry,
<br>As thou may see in timber by usual experiment,
<br>By process of time that oak shall utterly putrefy,
<br>And so likewise according to our intent,
<br>Sometimes our tree must with the Sun be burnt,
<br>And then with water we must make it cool,
<br>That by this means to rotting we may bring it well.
<p>For now in wet, and now again in dry,
<br>And now in heat, and now again to be in cold,
<br>Shall cause it soon to putrefy,
<br>And so shall thou bring to rotting your gold,
<br>Treat thy bodies as I have thee told,
<br>And in thy putrefying with heat be not too swift,
<br>Lest in the ashes thou seek after your thrift.
<p>Therefore your water you draw out of the earth,
<br>And make the soul therewith to ascend,
<br>Then down again into the earth it throw,
<br>That they oftentimes so ascend and descend,
<br>From violent heat and sudden cold descend your glass,
<br>And make your fire so temperate,
<br>That by the sides the matter be not vitrified.
<p>And be you wise in choosing of the matter,
<br>Meddle with no salts, sulphurs nor mean minerals,
<br>For whatsoever any worker to thee does clatter,
<br>Our Sulphur and Mercury be only in metals,
<br>Which some men call oils and waters,
<br>Fowls and bird, with many other names,
<br>So that fools should never know our stone.
<p>For of this world our stone is called the ferment,
<br>Which moved by craft as nature does require,
<br>In his increase shall be full opulent,
<br>And multiply his kind after thine own desire,
<br>Therefore is God vouchsafe you to inspire,
<br>To know the truth, and fancies to eschew,
<br>Like unto you in riches shall be but few.
<p>But many men be moved to work after their fantasy,
<br>In many subjects in which be tinctures gay,
<br>Both white and red divided manually to sight,
<br>But in the fire they fly away,
<br>Such break pots and glasses day by day,
<br>Poisoning themselves and losing their sight,
<br>With odours, smokes, and watching up by nights.
<p>Their clothes be bawdy and worn threadbare,
<br>Men may them smell for multipliers where they go,
<br>To file their fingers with corrosives they do not spare,
<br>Their eyes be bleary, their cheeks lean and blue,
<br>And thus I know they suffer loss and woe,
<br>And such when they have lost that was in their purse,
<br>Then do they chide, and Philosophers sore do curse.
<p>To see their houses is a noble sport,
<br>What furnaces, what glasses there be of diverse shapes,
<br>What salts, what powders, what oils, or acids,
<br>How eloquently of Materia Prima their tongues do clap,
<br>And yet to find the truth they have no hope,
<br>Of our Mercury they meddle and of our sulphur vive,
<br>Whereon they dote, and more and more unthrive.
<p>For all the while they have Philosophers been,
<br>Yet could they never know what was our Stone,
<br>Some sought it in dung, in urine, some in wine,
<br>Some in star slime (some thing it is but one),
<br>In blood and eggs : some till their thrift was gone,
<br>Dividing elements, and breaking many a pot,
<br>Shards multiplying, but yet they hit it not.
<p>They talk of the red man and of his white wife,
<br>That is a special thing, and of the Elixirs two,
<br>Of the Quintessence, and of the Elixir of life,
<br>Of honey, Celidonie, and of Secondines also,
<br>These they divide into Elements, with others more,
<br>No multipliers, but will they be called Philosophers,
<br>Which natural Philosophy did never read or see.
<p>This fellowship knows our Stone right well,
<br>They think them richer than is the King,
<br>They will him help, he shall not fail,
<br>To win for France a wondrous thing,
<br>The holy Cross home will they bring,
<br>And if the King were taken prisoner,
<br>Right soon his ransom would they make.
<p>A marvel it is that Westminster Kirk,
<br>Which these Philosophers do much haunt,
<br>Since they can so much riches work,
<br>As they make boast of and avaunt,
<br>Drinking daily at the wine due taunt,
<br>Is not made up perfectly at once,
<br>For truly it lacketh yet many stones.
<p>Fools do follow them at their tail,
<br>Promoted to riches wishing to be,
<br>But will you hear what worship and avail,
<br>They win in London that noble city ?
<br>With silver maces (as you may see),
<br>Sargents awaiteth on them each hour,
<br>So be they men of great honour.
<p>Sargents seek them from street to street,
<br>Merchants and Goldsmiths lay after them to watch,
<br>That well is him that with them may meet,
<br>For the great advantage that they do catch,
<br>They hunt about as does a dog,
<br>Expecting to win so great treasure,
<br>That ever in riches they shall endure.
<p>Some would catch their goods again,
<br>And some more good would adventure,
<br>Some for to have would be full fain,
<br>Of ten pounds one, I you ensure,
<br>Some which have lent their goods without measure,
<br>And are with poverty clad,
<br>To catch a noble, would be full glad.
<p>But when the Sargents do them arrest,
<br>Their pockets be stuffed with Paris balls,
<br>Or with signets of St Martin's at the least,
<br>But as for money it is pissed against the walls,
<br>Then they be led (as well for them befalls),
<br>To Newgate or Ludgate as I you tell,
<br>Because they shall in safeguard dwell.
<p>Where is my money become, saith one ?
<br>And where is mine, saith he and he ?
<br>But will you hear how subtle they be anon,
<br>In answering that they excused be,
<br>Saying of our Elixirs we were robbed,
<br>Else might we have paid you all your gold,
<br>Though it had been more by ten-fold.
<p>And then their creditors they flatter so,
<br>Promising to work for them again,
<br>In right short space the two Elixirs,
<br>Doting the Merchants that they be fain,
<br>To let them go, but ever in vain,
<br>They work so long, till at the last,
<br>They be again in prison cast.
<p>If any them ask why they be not rich ?
<br>They say that they can make fine gold of tin,
<br>But he (say they) may surely swim the ditch,
<br>Which is upholded by the chin,
<br>We have no stock, therefore may we not win,
<br>Which if we had, we would soon work enough,
<br>To finish up Westminster Kirk.
<p>And some of them be so devout,
<br>They will not dwell out of that place,
<br>For they may without doubt,
<br>Do what them list to their solace,
<br>The Archdeacon is so full of grace,
<br>That if they bless him with their cross,
<br>He forceth little of other mens loss.
<p>And when they there sit at the wine,
<br>These monks they say have many a pound,
<br>Would God (saith one) have some were mine,
<br>Yet care away, let the cup go round,
<br>Drink on saith another, the mean is found,
<br>I am a master of that Art,
<br>I warrant us we shall have part
<p>Such causes Monks evil to do,
<br>To waste their wages through their dotage,
<br>Some bringeth a mazer, and some a spoon,
<br>Their Philosophers gives them such comage,
<br>Behighting them winning with domage,
<br>A pound for a penny at the least again,
<br>And so fair promises make fools fain.
<p>A Royal medicine one upon twelve,
<br>They promise them thereof to have,
<br>Which they could never for themselves,
<br>Yet bring about, so God me save,
<br>Beware such Philosophers no man deprave,
<br>Which help these Monks to riches so,
<br>In threadbare coats that they must go.
<p>The Abbot ought well to cherish this company,
<br>For they can teach his Monks to live in poverty,
<br>And to go clothed and monied religiously,
<br>As did Saint Bennet, eschewing superfluity,
<br>Easing them also of the ponderosity of their purses,
<br>With pounds so aggravated,
<br>Which by Philosophy be now alleviated.
<p>Lo who meddles with this rich company,
<br>Great boast of their winning they may make,
<br>For they shall reap as much by their Philosophy,
<br>As they of the tail of an ape can take,
<br>Beware therefore for Jesus' sake,
<br>And meddle with nothing of great cost,
<br>For if thou do, it is but lost.
<p>These Philosophers (of which I spoke before),
<br>Meddle and blunder with many a thing,
<br>Running in errors ever more and more,
<br>For lack of true understanding,
<br>But like must always bring forth like,
<br>So hath God ordained in every kind,
<br>Would Jesus they would bear this is mind.
<p>They expect of a Nettle to have a Rose,
<br>Or of an Elder to have an apple sweet,
<br>Alas, that wisemen their goods should lose,
<br>Trusting such doctrines when they them meet,
<br>Which say our Stone is trodden under foot,
<br>And makes them vile things to distil,
<br>Till all their houses with stench they fill.
<p>Some of them never learned a word in Schools,
<br>Should such by reason understand Philosophy ?
<br>Be they Philosophers ? Nay, they be fools.
<br>For their works prove them without wit,
<br>Meddle not with them, if you would be happy,
<br>Lest with their flattery they so thee till,
<br>That you agree unto their will.
<p>Spend not thy money away in waste,
<br>Give not to every spirit credence,
<br>But first examine, grope and taste,
<br>And as thou provest, so put your confidence,
<br>But ever beware of great expense,
<br>And if the Philosopher do live virtuously,
<br>The better you may trust his Philosophy.
<p>Prove him first, and him appose,
<br>Of all the secrets of our Stone,
<br>Which if he know not, you need not to lose,
<br>Meddle you no further, but let him be gone,
<br>Though he make ever so piteous a moan,
<br>For then the Fox can fagg and faine,
<br>When he would to his prey attain.
<p>If he can answer as a Clerk,
<br>How he has not proved it indeed,
<br>And you then help him to his work,
<br>If he be virtuous I hold it merited,
<br>For he will thee quite if ever he speeds,
<br>And thou shalt know by a little anon,
<br>If he have knowledge of our Stone.
<p>One thing, one glass, one furnace, and no more,
<br>Behold if he does hold this principle,
<br>And if he do not, then let him go,
<br>For he shall never make thee a rich man,
<br>Timely it is better you forsake him,
<br>Than after with loss and variance,
<br>And other manner of unpleasance.
<p>But if God fortune you to have,
<br>This Science by doctrine which I have told,
<br>Reveal it not to whosoever it craves,
<br>For favour, fear, silver or gold.
<br>Be no oppressor, lecher not boaster bold,
<br>Serve thy God and help among the poor,
<br>If you wish this life to continue long.
<p>Unto thyself your secrets ever keep,
<br>From sinners, who have not God in dread,
<br>But will cast you in prison deep,
<br>Till you teach them to do it indeed,
<br>Then slander on you shall spring and spread,
<br>That you do coin then will they say,
<br>And so undo you for ever and aye.
<p>And if you teach them this cunning,
<br>Their sinful living for to maintain,
<br>In hell therefore shall be your winning,
<br>For God will take disdain of you and them,
<br>As thou nought could therefore you faine,
<br>That body and soul you may both save,
<br>And here in peace to have your living.
<p>Now in this Chapter I have taught you,
<br>How you must putrefy your body,
<br>And so to guide you that you be not caught,
<br>And put to durance loss and villany
<br>My doctrine therefore remember wisely,
<br>And pass forth towards the sixth gate,
<br>For thus the fifth is triumphate.
<p>The end of the Fifth Gate
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Sixth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Congelation</font></b></center>

<p>Of Congelation I need not much to write,
<br>But what it is, I will to you declare.
<br>It is the induration of soft things of colour white,
<br>And the fixation together of spirits which are flying,
<br>How to congeal, you need not much to care,
<br>For Elements will knit together soon,
<br>So that Putrefaction be kindly done.
<p>But Congelations be made in divers ways,
<br>Of spirits and bodies dissolved to water clear,
<br>Of salts also dissolved twice or thrice,
<br>And then congealed into a fluxible matter;
<br>Of such congealing, fools fast do clatter,
<br>And some dissolve, dividing the Elements manually,
<br>And congealing them after to a dry powder.
<p>But such congealing is not to our desire,
<br>For unto ours it is contrary,
<br>Our congelation dreads not the fire :
<br>For it must ever stand in it unctuous,
<br>And so it is also a tincture so bounteous,
<br>Which in the air congealed will not relent to water,
<br>For then our work were spoiled.
<p>Moreover congeal not into so hard a stone,
<br>As glass or crystal, which melteth by fusion,
<br>But so that it like wax will melt anon
<br>Without blast: and beware of delusion,
<br>For such congealing accords not to our conclusion,
<br>As will not flow, but run to water again,
<br>Like salt congealed, then labour you in vain.
<p>Which congelation avails us not a deal,
<br>It longeth to multipliers, congealing vulgarly,
<br>If you therefore wish to do well,
<br>(So that the medicine shall never flow kindly,
<br>Neither congeal, without you putrefy it first)
<br>First purge, and then fix the elements of our stone,
<br>Till they together congeal and flow anon.
<p>For when your matter is made perfectly white,
<br>Then will the spirit with the body be congealed,
<br>But of that time you may have long respite,
<br>Or it congeal, like pearls in your sight,
<br>Such congelation be you glad to see,
<br>And after like grains red as blood,
<br>Richer than any worldly good.
<p>The earthly grossness therefore first mortified,
<br>In moisture blackness is engendered;
<br>This principle may not be denied,
<br>For natural philosophers so say, I declare,
<br>Which had, of whiteness you may not miss;
<br>And into whiteness if thou congeal it once,
<br>Then have you a stone most precious of all stones.
<p>And like as the moist did putrefy the dry,
<br>Which caused in colour blackness to appear,
<br>So the moist is congealed by the dry,
<br>Engendering whiteness shining with might full clear,
<br>And dryness proceeding as the matter whitens,
<br>Like as in blackness moisture does him show,
<br>By colours variant always new and new.
<p>The cause of this is heat most temperate,
<br>Working and moving the matter continually,
<br>And thereby also the matter is altered,
<br>Both inward and outward substantially,
<br>Not as do fools to their sophistical sight;
<br>But in every part all fire to endure,
<br>Fluxible, fixed and stable in tincture.
<p>As Physic determines of each digestion,
<br>First done in the stomach in which is dryness,
<br>Causing whiteness without question,
<br>Like as the second digestion causes redness,
<br>Completed in the liver by temperate heat,
<br>Right so our Stone by dryness and by heat,
<br>Is digested to white and red complete.
<p>But here you must another secret know,
<br>How the Philosophers child in the air is born,
<br>Busy you not to blow at the coal too fast,
<br>And take this neither for mockery or scorn,
<br>But trust me truly, else is all your work forlorn,
<br>Without your earth with water be revived,
<br>Our true congealing you shall never see.
<p>A soul it is, being betwixt heaven and earth,
<br>Arising from the earth as air with water pure,
<br>And causing life in every lively thing,
<br>Incessant running upon our four fold nature,
<br>Enforcing to better them with all its cure,
<br>Which air is the fire of our Philosophy,
<br>Named now oil, now water mystically.
<p>And by this means air which we call oil or water,
<br>Our fire, our ointment, our spirit, and our Stone,
<br>In which one thing we ground our wisdoms all,
<br>Goes neither in nor out alone,
<br>Nor the fire but the water anon.
<br>First it leads out, and after it brings in,
<br>As water with water, which will not lightly twin.
<p>And so may water only our water move,
<br>Which moving causes both death and life
<br>And water to water doth kindly cleave,
<br>Without repugnance or any strife,
<br>Which water to fools is nothing rife,
<br>Being without doubt of the kind of the Spirit,
<br>Called water and that which leads out.
<p>And water is the secret and life of every thing
<br>Of substance found in this world,
<br>For of water each thing has its beginning,
<br>As is shown in women, when they are unbound,
<br>Of water called Albumen, which passes before if all be sound,
<br>First from them running,
<br>With grievous throes before their childing.
<p>And truly that is the most principal cause,
<br>Why Philosophers charge us to be patient,
<br>Till in time the water be dried all to powder,
<br>With nourishing heat, continual, not violent;
<br>For qualities be contrary of every element,
<br>Till after black in white be made a union,
<br>Of them for ever, congealed without division.
<p>And furthermore, the preparation of this conversion,
<br>From thing to thing, from one state to another,
<br>Is done only by kindly and discrete operation of Nature,
<br>As is of sperm within the mother;
<br>For sperm and heat, are as sister and brother,
<br>Which be converted in themselves as nature can,
<br>By action and passion at last to perfect man.
<p>For as the bodily part by nature was combined,
<br>Into man, is such as the beginner was,
<br>Which though it thus from thing to thing was altered,
<br>Not out of kind, to mix with other kind did pass,
<br>And so our matter spermatical within our glass,
<br>Within itself must turn from thing to thing,
<br>By most temperate heat only nourishing it.
<p>Another natural example I may tell you,
<br>How the substance of an egg by nature is wrought
<br>Into a chicken without passing out of the shell,
<br>A plainer example I could not have thought,
<br>And their conversions be made till forth be brought,
<br>From state to state, the like by like in kind,
<br>With nourishing heat : only bear this in mind.
<p>Another example here also you may read,
<br>Of vegetable things, taking consideration,
<br>How every thing grows of its own seed,
<br>Through heat and moisture, by natural operation,
<br>And therefore minerals be nourished by the administration
<br>Of radical moisture, which was their beginning,
<br>Not passing their kind within one glass.
<p>There we turn them from thing to thing again,
<br>Into their mother the water when they go,
<br>Which principle unknown, you labourest in vain.
<br>Then all is sperm ; and things there be no more,
<br>But kind with kind in number two,
<br>Male and female, agent and patient,
<br>Within the matrix of the earth most orient.
<p>And these be turned by heat from thing to thing
<br>Within one glass, and so from state to state,
<br>Until the time that nature does bring them,
<br>Into one substance of the water regenerate:
<br>And so the sperm with his kind is altered,
<br>Able in likeness his kind to multiply,
<br>As does in kind all other things naturally.
<p>In the time of this said natural process,
<br>While that the conceived sperm is growing
<br>The substance is nourished with his own menstrual,
<br>Which water only out of the earth did spring,
<br>Whose colour is green in the first showing;
<br>And from that time the Sun hides his light,
<br>Taking his course throughout the North by night.
<p>The said menstrual (I say to you in counsel)
<br>The blood of our green Lion and not of vitriol,
<br>Dame Venus can the truth of this tell to you,
<br>At the beginning, to counsel if you call her,
<br>The secret is hid by Philosophers great and small,
<br>Which blood drawn out of our green Lion,
<br>For lack of heat had not perfect digestion.
<p>But this blood called our secret menstrual,
<br>Wherewith our sperm is nourished temperately,
<br>When it is turned into the corporeal faeces,
<br>And so become perfectly white and very dry,
<br>Congealed and fixed into his own body,
<br>Then decocted blood to sight it may well seem,
<br>Of this work named the milk white diadem.
<p>Understand now that our fiery water thus sharp,
<br>Is called our menstrual water,
<br>Wherein our earth is loosed and naturally calcined,
<br>By congelation that they may never twine,
<br>But yet to congeal more water you may not hesitate,
<br>Into three parts of the acuate water said before,
<br>With the fourth part of the earth congealed and no more.
<p>Unto that substance therefore so congelate,
<br>The fourth part put of crystalline water,
<br>And make them then together to be disposed,
<br>By congelation into a miner metalline,
<br>Which like a new slipped sword will shine,
<br>After the blackness which first will show,
<br>The fourth part then give it of water new.
<p>Many imbibitions it must have yet,
<br>Give it the second, and after the third also,
<br>The said proportion keeping in your wit,
<br>Then to another the fourth time look you go,
<br>Therefore pass not the fifth time and the sixth,
<br>But put two parts at each time of them three,
<br>And at the seventh time five parts must there be.
<p>When you have made imbibition seven times,
<br>Again you must turn your wheel,
<br>And putrefy all that matter without addition,
<br>First abiding blackness if you will do well,
<br>Then into whiteness congeal it up each deal,
<br>And after by redness into the south ascend,
<br>Then have you brought your base to an end.
<p>Thus is your water then divided into two parts,
<br>With the first part the bodies be putrefied,
<br>And to your imbibitions the second part must go,
<br>With which your matter is afterward denigrated,
<br>And soon upon easy decoction albificated,
<br>Then is it named by Philosophers our starry stone,
<br>Bring that to redness, then is the sixth gate won.
<p>The end of the Sixth Gate

<p><b><font size=+1>The Seventh Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Cibation</font></b></center>

<p>Now I turn my pen to write of Cibation,
<br>Since it must here the seventh place occupy:
<br>But in few words it will be expedited,
<br>Take heed therefore, and understand me wisely;
<br>Cibation is called a feeding of our dry matter,
<br>With milk and meat, which moderately you do,
<br>Until it be brought unto the third order.
<p>But give it never so much, that you it glut,
<br>Beware of dropsy, and also of Noah's flood:
<br>By little and little therefore you to it put
<br>Of meat and drink, as seems to do it good,
<br>That watery humours not overgrow the blood,
<br>To drink therefore let it be measured so,
<br>That you never quench it from that kindly appetite.
<p>For if it drink too much, then it must have
<br>A vomit or else it will be sick too long from the dropsy
<br>Therefore thy womb thou save,
<br>And from the flux, or else it will be wrong,
<br>But rather let it thirst for drink along
<br>Than you should give it overmuch at once.
<br>Which must in youth be dieted for the nonce.
<p>And if you diet it (as nature does require) moderately,
<br>Till time that it be grown to age,
<br>Keeping it from cold, and nourishing it with moist fire,
<br>Then it shall grow, and wax full of courage,
<br>And do to you both pleasure and advantage;
<br>For it shall make dark bodies whole and bright,
<br>Cleansing their leprosies through its might.
<p>Three time must you also turn about your wheel,
<br>Still keeping the rule of the said Cibation,
<br>And then as soon as it does feel the fire,
<br>Like wax it will be ready unto liquation:
<br>This chapter needs no longer protestation,
<br>For I have told you the diet most convenient,
<br>After thine elements be made equipolent.
<p>And also how you shall bring thy gold to whiteness,
<br>Most like in figure to leaves of the hawthorn tree,
<br>Called Magnesia, as I have told before,
<br>And our White Sulphur without combustibility,
<br>Which from the fire will never fly away.
<br>And thus the seventh gate (as you desired)
<br>In the uprising of the Sun is conquered.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Eighth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Sublimation</font></b></center>

<p>Here of our Sublimation a word or two
<br>I have to speak, which is the eighth gate.
<br>Fools do sublime, but you do not sublime so,
<br>For we sublime not in the way they do,
<br>To sublime truly therefore you shall not miss,
<br>If you can make they bodies first spiritual,
<br>And then your spirits (as I have taught you) corporeal.
<p>Some do sublime Mercury from vitriol and salt,
<br>And other spirits from scales of iron and steel,
<br>Calcined from egg shells, and from quicklime,
<br>And in their manner yet sublime they right well,
<br>But such subliming accords never a deal,
<br>To our intents, for we sublime not so,
<br>To true subliming therefore, now I will go.
<p>In Sublimation first beware of one thing,
<br>That thou sublime to the top of the vessel;
<br>For without violence you shall not bring it down again,
<br>But there it will abide and dwell.
<br>So I tell you it rejoices with refrigeration,
<br>Keep it down therefore with temperate heat,
<br>Full forty days, till it wax black and brown.
<p>For then the soul begins to come out
<br>From his own veins, for all that is subtle,
<br>Will with the spirit ascend without doubt,
<br>Bear in your mind therefore, and think on this,
<br>How here eclipsed be your bodies,
<br>As they do putrefy subliming more and more into water
<br>Until they be all borne upwards.
<p>And thus when they have spued out their venom,
<br>Into the water then it does appear black,
<br>Becoming spiritual each deal without doubt,
<br>Subliming easily in our manner,
<br>Into the water, which does bear it:
<br>For in the air our child must thus be born
<br>Of the water again, as I have said before.
<p>But when these two by continual Sublimation,
<br>Be laboured so with heat both moist and temperate,
<br>That is all white and purely made spiritual,
<br>Then heaven upon earth must be reiterated,
<br>Until the soul with the body be incorporated,
<br>That earth become all that before was heaven,
<br>Which will be done in seven Sublimations.
<p>And Sublimations we make for three causes,
<br>The first cause is, to make the body spiritual,
<br>The second is, that the spirit may be corporeal ,
<br>And become fixed with it and consubstantial,
<br>The third cause is, that from its filthy original
<br>It may be cleansed, and its saltiness sulphurious,
<br>May be diminished in it, which is infectious.
<p>Then when they thus together be freed from impurities,
<br>They will sublime up whiter than the snow;
<br>That sight will greatly comfort you :
<br>For then anon perfectly you shalt know,
<br>The spirits shall so be thrown down,
<br>That this eighth gate shall to thee be unlocked,
<br>Out of which many are shut and mocked.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Ninth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Fermentation</font></b></center>

<p>True Fermentation few workers understand,
<br>That secret therefore I will expound to you.
<br>I travelled truly through many a land,
<br>Ere ever I might find any that would tell it me :
<br>Yet as God would, evermore blessed be he,
<br>At at last I came to the perfected knowledge thereof,
<br>Take heed therefore what I thereof do write.
<p>Fermentations in divers manners be done,
<br>By which our medicine must be perpetuated,
<br>Into clear water - some looseth Sun and Moon,
<br>And with their medicines make them to be congealed;
<br>Which in the fire when they be examined,
<br>May not abide, nor alter with complement:
<br>For such fermenting is not to our intent.
<p>But yet more kindly some other men do,
<br>Fermenting their medicines in this way -
<br>In Mercury dissolving both Sun and Moon,
<br>Till time with the spirit they will arise,
<br>Subliming them together twice or thrice;
<br>Then Fermentation therewith they make;
<br>That is a way, but yet we it forsake.
<p>Some others there be which have more sense,
<br>To touch the truth in part of fermenting -
<br>They amalgam their bodies with Mercury like pap,
<br>Then thereupon their medicines relenting;
<br>These of our secrets have some hint,
<br>But not the truth with perfect complement
<br>Because they neither putrefy, nor alter their Ferment.
<p>That point therefore I will disclose to you,
<br>Look how you did with your imperfect body -
<br>Do so with thy perfect bodies in each degree,
<br>That is to say, first you putrefy them,
<br>Destroying their former qualities utterly,
<br>For this is wholly to our intent,
<br>That first you alter before you ferment.
<p>To your compound make ferment the fourth part,
<br>Which ferments be only of Sun and Moon,
<br>If you therefore be master of this art,
<br>Your fermentation let thus be done,
<br>Fix water and earth together soon,
<br>And when your medicine as wax do flow,
<br>Then upon amalgams look you it throw.
<p>And when all that together is mixed,
<br>Above the glass well closed make your fire,
<br>And so continue it till all be fixed,
<br>And well fermented to your desire,
<br>Then make Projection after thy pleasure
<br>For that is medicine each deal perfected,
<br>Thus must you ferment both red and white.
<p>For like as flour of wheat made into a paste,
<br>Requires ferment, which we call leaven of bread,
<br>That it may have the kindly taste,
<br>And become cordial food to man and woman,
<br>So you shall ferment your medicine,
<br>That it may taste of the Ferment pure,
<br>At all assays for ever to endure.
<p>And understand that there be Ferments three,
<br>Two be of bodies in nature clean,
<br>Which must be altered as I have told you;
<br>The third most secret of which I mean,
<br>Is the first earth of his water green:
<br>And therefore when the Lion does thirst,
<br>Make him to drink till his belly burst.
<p>Of this a question if I should move,
<br>And ask of workers, what is this thing ?
<br>Anon thereby I should them prove,
<br>If they had knowledge of our fermenting:
<br>For many a man speaks with wondering,
<br>Of Robin Hood and of his bow,
<br>Which never shot therein I trow.
<p>For true Fermentation as I tell you,
<br>Is the incorporation of the soul with the bodies,
<br>Restoring to it the kindly smell,
<br>With taste and colour by natural compacting together,
<br>Of things dissevered, a due re-integration,
<br>Whereby the body of the spirit takes impression.
<br>That either the other may help to have ingression.
<p>For like as bodies in their compaction corporeal,
<br>May not show out their qualities effectually,
<br>Until the time that they become spiritual,
<br>No more may spirits abide with bodies steadfastly,
<br>Till they be fixed together with them proportionally,
<br>For then the body teaches the spirit to suffer fire,
<br>And the spirit the body to enter to your desire.
<p>Therefore you must ferment your gold with gold,
<br>Your earth cleansed with his own water, I mean,
<br>Nought else to say but element with element,
<br>The spirit of life only going between,
<br>For like as an adamant as you have seen
<br>Draws iron to him, so does our earth by kind,
<br>Draw down to him his soul borne up with wind.
<p>With wind therefore the soul lead out and in,
<br>Mingle gold with gold, that is to say,
<br>Make Element with Element together run,
<br>Till time all fire they may suffer,
<br>For earth is Ferment without nay to water,
<br>And water the earth unto,
<br>Our Fermentation in this way must be done.
<p>Earth is gold, and so is the soul also,
<br>Not common, but ours thus elementary,
<br>And yet thereto the Sun must go,
<br>That by our wheel it may be altered:
<br>For so to ferment it must be prepared,
<br>That it profoundly may be joined,
<br>With other natures as I said to you.
<p>And whatsoever I have here said of gold,
<br>The same of silver I will you understand,
<br>That you putrefy them and alter (as I have told)
<br>Ere you take in hand to ferment your medicine.
<br>Forsooth I could never find anyone in England
<br>Who could teach me to ferment in this way ,
<br>Without error, by practice or by speech.
<p>Now of this chapter needs to treat no more,
<br>Such I intend prolixity to eschew;
<br>Remember well my words therefore,
<br>Which you shall prove by practice true,
<br>And Sun and Moon look you renew,
<br>That they may hold of the fifth nature,
<br>Then shall their tincture evermore endure.
<p>And yet a way there is most excellent,
<br>Belonging unto another working,
<br>A water we make most redolent,
<br>All bodies to oil wherewith we bring,
<br>With which our medicine we make flowing,
<br>A quintessence this water we call,
<br>Which heals all diseases in man.
<p>But with my base, after my doctrine prepared,
<br>Which is our calx this must be done,
<br>For when our bodies be so calcined,
<br>That water will to oil dissolve them soon
<br>Make you therefore oil both of the Sun and Moon,
<br>Which is ferment most fragrant for to smell,
<br>And so the ninth gate of this Castle is conquered.
<p>The end of the Ninth Gate.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Tenth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Exaltation</font></b></center>

<p>We proceed now to the chapter of Exaltation,
<br>Of which truly you must have pure knowledge,
<br>But little is different from Sublimation,
<br>If you conceive it right I you ensure,
<br>Hereto accords the holy scripture,
<br>Christ saying thus - "if I exalted be,
<br>Then shall I draw all things unto me".
<p>Our medicine if we exalt so,
<br>It shall be thereby ennobled,
<br>That must be done in two manners,
<br>From time the parties be disposed,
<br>Which must be crucified and examined,
<br>And then bury together both man and wife,
<br>To be after revived by the spirit of life.
<p>Then up to heaven they must be exalted,
<br>There to be in body and soul glorified,
<br>For you must bring them to such subtlety,
<br>That they ascend together to enter,
<br>In clouds of clearness uniting together with Angels,
<br>Then shall they draw as you shall see,
<br>All other bodies to their own dignity.
<p>If you therefore will exalt the bodies,
<br>First you augment them with the spirit of life,
<br>Till in time the earth be well subtilized,
<br>By natural rectifying of every Element,
<br>Exalting them up into the firmament,
<br>Then much more precious shall they be than gold,
<br>Because of the quintessence which they do hold.
<p>For when the cold has overcome the heat,
<br>Then into water the air shall be turned,
<br>And so two contraries together shall meet,
<br>Till either with the other right well agree,
<br>So into air the water as I tell thee,
<br>When heat of cold has got domination,
<br>Shall be converted by craft of our circulation.
<p>And of the air then fire you shall have,
<br>By loosening, putrefying and subliming,
<br>And fire you have of the earth material,
<br>Thus by craft dissevering your elements,
<br>Most especially well calcining your earth,
<br>And when they be each one made pure,
<br>Then do they hold all of the first nature.
<p>In this way therefore make them be circulated,
<br>Each into other exalting by and by,
<br>And all in this one glass surely sigillate,
<br>Not with thine hands, but as I teach you naturally,
<br>Fire into water, then turn first hardly,
<br>For fire is in Air, which is in water existent,
<br>And this conversion accords to our intent.
<p>Then furthermore turn on your wheel,
<br>That into earth the air converted be,
<br>Which will be done also right well,
<br>For Air is in water being earth, trust me,
<br>The water into fire, contrary in her quality,
<br>Soon turn you may, for water is in earth,
<br>Which is in fire, convertion true is this.
<p>The wheel is now near turned about,
<br>Into air turn earth which is the proper nest,
<br>Of other Elements there is no doubt,
<br>For earth is in fire, which in air takes rest,
<br>This circulation begin you in the west,
<br>Then into the south, till they exalted be,
<br>Proceed duly, as I have taught you in the figure *.
<p>In which process clearly you may see,
<br>From one extreme how to another you may not go,
<br>But by a mean, since they in qualities contrary be,
<br>And reason will show that it be so,
<br>As heat into cold, with other contraries more,
<br>Without their means, as moist to heat and and cold,
<br>Examples sufficient before this I have told.
<p>Thus I have taught you how to make,
<br>Of all your Elements a perfect circulation,
<br>And at the figure example to take,
<br>How you shall make this foresaid Exaltation,
<br>And of your medicine in the Elements true graduation,
<br>Till it be brought to a generative temperate,
<br>And then you have conquered the tenth gate.
<p>The end of the tenth gate.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Eleventh Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Multiplication</font></b></center>

<p>Now I proceed to declare Multiplication,
<br>Which is by Philosophers in this way defined,
<br>Augmentation it is of the Elixir indeed,
<br>In goodness and quantity both for white and red,
<br>Multiplication is therefore as they do write,
<br>That thing that does augment medicines in each degree,
<br>In colour, in odour, in virtue, and also in quantity.
<p>And why may you multiply this medicine infinitely,
<br>Forsooth the cause is this,
<br>For it is fire, which kindled will never die,
<br>Dwelling with you, as fire does in houses,
<br>Of which one spark may make more fire this way,
<br>As musk in pigments and other spices more,
<br>In virtue multiplied, and our medicine right so.
<p>So he, who fire has less or more, is rich,
<br>Because he may multiply it so hugely,
<br>And so is he rich, who has in store any part,
<br>Of our Elixir which can be augmented infinitely -
<br>One way if you dissolve our powders dry,
<br>And make often times of them Congelation,
<br>Thereof in goodness then you make Augmentation.
<p>The second way both in goodness and quantity,
<br>It multiplies by iterated Fermentation,
<br>As in that chapter I showed plainly to thee,
<br>By diverse manners of natural operation,
<br>And also in the chapter of our Cibation,
<br>Where you may know how you shall multiply,
<br>Your medicine with Mercury infinitely.
<p>But if you will both loose and eke ferment,
<br>Both more in quantity and better will it be -
<br>And in such ways you may augment it soon,
<br>That in your glass it will grow like a tree,
<br>The tree of Hermes named seemly to see,
<br>Of which one pip in a thousand will multiply,
<br>If you can make your projection wisely.
<p>And just as with Saffron when it is pulverised,
<br>By little and little if it be tempered with liquor,
<br>When with much more liquor dilated,
<br>Tinges much more of liquor in quantity,
<br>That being whole in his gross nature :
<br>So shall you see, that our Elixir, the more it is made thin,
<br>The further in tincture it fastly will run.
<p>Keep in your fire therefore both morning and evening,
<br>So that you do not need to run from house to house,
<br>Among thy neighbours to seek or borrow your fire ,
<br>The more you keep, the more good shall you win,
<br>Multiplying it always more and more within your glass,
<br>By feeding with Mercury unto your lives end,
<br>So shall you have more than you need to spend.
<p>This matter is plain, thereof I will write no more,
<br>Let reason guide you,
<br>Be never the bolder to sin therefore,
<br>But serve thy God the better in each tide,
<br>And while that you shall in this life abide,
<br>Bear this in mind, forget not I thee pray,
<br>As thou shalt appear before God at domesday.
<p>His own great gifts therefore and his treasure,
<br>Dispose you virtuously, helping the poor at need,
<br>That in this world you may procure to yourself,
<br>Mercy and grace with heavenly bliss to merit,
<br>And pray to God devoutly that he lead you,
<br>In at the twelfth gate, as he can best,
<br>Soon after then you shall end your conquest.
<p>The end of the eleventh gate.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Twelfth Gate</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Projection</font></b></center>

<p>In Projection it shall be proved if our practice be profitable,
<br>Of which it behoves me the secrets here to move,
<br>Therefore if your tincture be sure and not variable,
<br>By a little of your medicine thus you may prove,
<br>With Metal, or with Mercury as pitch it will cleave,
<br>And tinge in Projection all fires to abide,
<br>And soon it will enter and spread full wide.
<p>But many by ignorance do mar what they made,
<br>When they make Projection on uncleansed metals,
<br>For because of corruption their tinctures must fade,
<br>Which they would not first take away from the body,
<br>Which after Projection be brittle, blue and black.
<br>That your tincture therefore may evermore last,
<br>First see you cast your medicine upon ferment.
<p>Then brittle as glass will your ferment be,
<br>Upon bodies cleansed and made very pure,
<br>Cast that brittle substance and soon you shall see,
<br>That they shall be curiously coloured with tincture,
<br>With all assays for ever shall endure,
<br>But profitable Projection perfectly to make,
<br>At the Psalms of the Psalter example thou take.
<p>On 'Fundamenta' cast this psalm 'Nunc dimittis',
<br>Upon 'verba mea', then cast 'Fundamenta' believe,
<br>Then 'Verba' upon 'diligam', conceive me with your wits,
<br>And 'diligam' upon 'attendite', if you wish to thrive,
<br>Thus make you Projections, three, four, or five,
<br>Till the tincture of the medicine begin to decrease,
<br>And then it is time for Projection to cease.
<p>By this misty talking I mean nothing else,
<br>But that you must cast first the less on the more,
<br>Increasing ever the number as wise men tell you,
<br>And keep you this secret unto yourself in store,
<br>Be covetous of cunning it is no sore burden,
<br>For he that does not join the Elixir with bodies made clean,
<br>Surely does not know what projection does mean.
<p>Ten if thy multiply first into ten,
<br>One hundred that number will assuredly make,
<br>If one hundred into an hundred be multiplied,
<br>Then ten thousand is that number if you count it wisely,
<br>Then into as much more ten thousand to multiply,
<br>Is a thousand thousand, I say,
<br>Which multiplied into as much more, is a hundred millions.
<p>That hundred millions being multiplied likewise,
<br>Into ten thousand millions, as I do say to you,
<br>Making so great a number I know not what it is,
<br>Your number in Projection thus multiply always.
<br>Now child through your courtesy for me that you pray,
<br>Since I have told you our secrets all and some,
<br>To which I beseech GOD by grace you may come.
<p>Now you have conquered these twelve gates,
<br>And all the Castle you hold at your will,
<br>Keep your secrets in store to yourself,
<br>And the commandments of God look you fulfil,
<br>See you continue your glasses still in fire,
<br>And multiply your medicines always more and more,
<br>For wise men do say, that store is no sore.
