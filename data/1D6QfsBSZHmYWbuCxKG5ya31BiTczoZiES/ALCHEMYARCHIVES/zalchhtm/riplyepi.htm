<center><b><font size=+1>The Epistle to King Edward IV</font></b>
<p><b>by</b>
<br><b>George Ripley</b></center>

<p>O Honorable Lord, and most victorious Knight,
<br>With grace and vertue abundantly endewed,
<br>The safegaurd of England, and the maintainer of right;
<br>That God you loveth, indeed he that well shewed:
<br>Wherefore I trust this land shalbe renewed
<br>With joy and riches, with charitie and peace,
<br>So that olde ranckors new understrewed,
<br>Tempestuous troubles, and wretchednes shall cease.
<p>And therefore sith I see by tokens right evident,
<br>That God you guideth, and how that you be vertuous,
<br>Hating sinne, and all such as be insolent,
<br>How that also manslaughter to you is odious,
<br>Upon the judgement also that you be piteous:
<br>Me seemeth ruthe it were but that you should live long;
<br>For of your great fortune you are not presumptuous,
<br>Nor vengeable of spirit to revenge you of each wrong.
<p>These considered with others in your most noble State,
<br>Like as God knoweth, and people doo witnes beare,
<br>So entirely me mooveth, that I must algate
<br>Record the same, and therein be no flatterer:
<br>And not that only, but also to write here
<br>Unto your Highnes, humbly to present
<br>Great secretts, which in farre countries I did learne,
<br>And which by grace to me most unworthie are lent.
<p>Once to your Lordship such things I did promise,
<br>What time you did command to send unto me,
<br>And sith that I wrote it in secret wise,
<br>Unto your grace from the Universitie
<br>Of Louaine, when God fortuned me by grace to see
<br>Greater secrets and much more perfite,
<br>Which onely to you I will disclosed to be,
<br>That is the great Elixer both red and white.
<p>For like it you to trust that truly I have found,
<br>The perfect was of most secret Alchymie,
<br>Which I will never truly for marke nor for pound
<br>Make common but to you, and that conditionally,
<br>That to youre selfe you shall keepe it full secretly,
<br>And only to use it as may be to Gods pleasure,
<br>Else in time comming to God I should abye,
<br>For my discovering of his secret treasure.
<p>Therefore be you well advised and with good deliberation,
<br>For of this secret shall know no other creature,
<br>But onely you as I make faithfull protestation,
<br>For all the time that herein life I shall endure,
<br>Whereto I will your Lordship me ensure, To my desire in this my oath
for to agree,
<br>Least I to me the wrath of God procure,
<br>For such revealing of his great gift and privitie.
<p>If God fortune you by me to win this treasure,
<br>Serve him devowtly with more lawde and thanking,
<br>Praying his Godhead in life that you may so endure,
<br>His gifts of grace, and fortune to use to his pleasing,
<br>Most especially intending over all thing,
<br>To your power and cunning his precepts ten
<br>So to observe, that into no danger your selfe you bring,
<br>But that you in glory may see him hereafter, Amen.
<p>And yet moreover I will your Lordship to pardon me,
<br>For openly with pen I will it never it write,
<br>But whensoever also this precious secret, most of delight,
<br>By mouth also this precious secret, most of delight,
<br>How may be made perfect Elixers both red and white,
<br>Plaine unto your Lordship it shall declared be,
<br>And if it please you, with easie expences and respite,
<br>I will them worke by grace of the Trinitie.
<p>But notwithstanding for perill that may befall,
<br>If I dare not here plainly the knott unbinde,
<br>Yet in my writing I will not be so misticall,
<br>But that by studie the true knowledge you may finde,
<br>How that each thing is multiplied in his kinde,
<br>And how the likenes of bodies metaline be transmutable
<br>I will declare, that if you feele me in your minde,
<br>My writing you shall finde true and no fained fable.
<p>As Philosophers in the metheors doe write,
<br>The likenes of bodies metaline be not transmutable,
<br>But after he added these wordes of more delight,
<br>Without they be reduced to their beginning materiable,
<br>Wherefore such bodies within nature be liquiable,
<br>Minerall and metaline may be mercrurizate,
<br>Conceive you may this science is not opinionable,
<br>But very true, by Raymond and others determinate,
<p>In the saide booke the Philosophers speake also,
<br>Therein if it please your Highnes for to reade,
<br>Of divers sulphures, and especially of two,
<br>And of two mercuries joyned to them indeed,
<br>Whereby he doth true understanders leade,
<br>To the knowledge of the principle which is onely trew,
<br>Both red, moist, pure, and white, as I have espied,
<br>Which be neverthelesse found but of verie few.
<p>And these two things be best, he added anone
<br>For him that worketh the Alchymie to take:
<br>Our golde and our silver therewith to make all one,
<br>Wherefore I say who will our pearle and Ruby make,
<br>The said principles looke he not forsake:
<br>For at the beginning, if his principles be true,
<br>And if so be by craft he can them also bake,
<br>In th’end truly his worke he shall not rue.
<p>But one great secret right needfull to be knowne,
<br>That though the Philosophers speake plurally,
<br>All is but one thing you may me well trowe,
<br>In kinde which is our base principally,
<br>Whereof doth spring both white and red naturally,
<br>And yet the white must come first out of the red,
<br>Which is not wrought manually,
<br>But natually, craft helping out of our lead.
<p>For all the partes of our most precious stone,
<br>As I can prove, be coessentiall and concrete,
<br>Moreover there is no true principle but one,
<br>Full long is was ere I therewith could meete,
<br>Who can reduce him and knoweth his heate,
<br>And onely kinde with kinde can well redresse,
<br>Till filthie originall be clensed from his seate,
<br>He likely is to finde our secrets more and lesse.
<p>Therefore worke kinde onely with his owne kinde,
<br>And so your Elements joyne that they are not strive.
<br>This poynt also for any beare in minde,
<br>That passive natures you turne into active,
<br>Of water, fire, and wind of earth make blive,
<br>And of the quadrangle make a figure round,
<br>Then have thou the honie of our bee-hive,
<br>One ounce well worth one thousand pound.
<p>The principall secret of secrets all,
<br>Is true proportion which may not be behinde,
<br>Wherein I counsell thee be not superficiall,
<br>The true conclusion if you thinke to finde,
<br>Turne earth into water and water into winde,
<br>Therefore make fire and beware of the flood
<br>Of Noah, wherein many men are so blinde,
<br>That by this science they get liitle good.
<p>I counsell you eate and drink temperately,
<br>And beware well that Iposarche come not in place,
<br>Neshe not your wombe by drinking immoderately,
<br>Least you quench naturall heate in little space,
<br>The colour will tell appearing in your face,
<br>Drinke no more therefore than you may eate,
<br>Walke up and downe after an easie pace,
<br>Chase not your bodie too sore to sweate.
<p>With easie fire after moving when you sweate,
<br>Warme your bodie and make it drie againe,
<br>By rivers and fountaines walke after meate,
<br>At morning time visit the high mountaine,
<br>That Phisick so biddeth I read certaine,
<br>So high the mountaines yet doe you not ascend,
<br>But that you may downwardes your way have plaine,
<br>And with your mantle from colde ye you defend.
<p>Such labour is wholesome your sweate for to drie,
<br>With napkin, and after it see you take no colde,
<br>For grosse humours be purged by sweate kindely,
<br>Used Diacameron then confect with perfect golde,
<br>Hermidocles for watery humors good I holde,
<br>Use spericon perforat with milke of tincturiall,
<br>And sperma Caeti with red wine, and when you wax olde,
<br>And Goats milke sod with wine nourisheth moysture radicall.
<p>But a good Phisitien who so intendeth to be,
<br>Our lower Astronomie needeth well to know,
<br>And after that to learne well urine in a glass to see,
<br>And if it neede to be chafed the fire for to blow,
<br>Then wittily it by divers wayes for to throw
<br>After the cause to make a medicine bliue,
<br>Truly telling the infirmities all on a row,
<br>Who this can doe by his Phisick is like to thrive.
<p>We have our heaven incorruptible of the quintessence,
<br>Ornate with signes, Elements, and starres bright,
<br>Which moysteth our earth by subtill influence,
<br>And of it a secret sulphure hid from sight,
<br>It fetcheth by vertue of his active might,
<br>Like as the Bee fetcheth honey out of the flower,
<br>Which thing could doe no other worldly weight.
<br>Therefore to God be all glory and honour.
<p>And like as yce to water doth relent,
<br>Where it was congealed by violence of colde,
<br>When Phoebus it shineth with his heate influent,
<br>Even so to water minerall reduced is our golde,
<br>As witnesseth plainly, Albert, Raymond, and Arnold,
<br>By heate and moysture and by craft occasionate,
<br>Which congelation of the spirits, loe now I have tolde,
<br>How our materialls together must be proportionate.
<p>At the dyers craft you may learne this science,
<br>Beholding with water how decoction they make
<br>Upon the wad or madder easily and with patience,
<br>Till tinctures doe appeare are which then the cloth doth take,
<br>Therein so fixed that they will never forsake
<br>The cloth, for washing after they joyned be,
<br>Even so our tinctures with the water of our lake,
<br>We draw by boyling with the ashes of Hermes tree.
<p>Which tinctures when they by craft are made perfite,
<br>So dyeth mettles with colours aye permanent,
<br>After the qualitie of the medicine, red or white,
<br>That never away with anie fire wilbe brent:
<br>To this example if you take good tent,
<br>Unto your purpose the rather you shall winne.
<br>And let your fire be easie, and not too fervent,
<br>Where nature did leave what time you did beginne.
<p>First calcine, and after that putrifie,
<br>Dissolve, distill, sublime, discend, and fixe,
<br>With Aqua vitae oft times both wash and drie,
<br>And make a marriage the bodie and spirite betwixt,
<br>Which thus together naturallie if you can mixe,
<br>In loosing of the bodie the water congeald shalbe,
<br>Then shall the bodie die utterlie of the flixe,
<br>Bleeding and changing his colour, as you shall see.
<p>The third day againe to life he shall arise,
<br>And devoure birds, and beasts of the wildernesse,
<br>Crowes, popingaies, pies, peacocks, and mavois,
<br>The Phoenix, with the Eagle, and the Griffin of fearfulnesse,
<br>The greene Lion, with the red Dragon he shall distresse,
<br>With the white Dragon, and the Antelop, Unicorn &amp; Panther,
<br>With other beasts and birds both more and lesse,
<br>The Basiliske also, which almost each one doth feare.
<p>In bus and nibus he shall arise and descend,
<br>Up to the Moone, and sith up to the Sunne,
<br>Through the Ocean sea, which round is withouten end,
<br>Onely shippen within a little glassen tunne;
<br>When he is there come, then is the mastrie wonne:
<br>About which journey, great goods you shall not spend,
<br>And yet you shall be glad that ever it was begunne,
<br>Patiently if you list to your worke attend.
<p>For then both bodie and spirite with oyle and water,
<br>Soule, and tincture, one thing both white and red,
<br>After colours variable it containeth, what souer men clatter;
<br>Which also is called after he hath been dead
<br>And is revived, our Markaside, our Magnet, and our lead,
<br>Our Sulphur, our Arsinike, and our true Calx vive,
<br>Our Sunne, our Moone, our ferment and our bread,
<br>Our toad, our Basiliske, our unknowen bodie, our man, our wife.
<p>Our bodie thus naturally by craft when he is renovate
<br>Of the first order, is medicine called in our Philosophie;
<br>Which oftentimes againe must be propertualicate,
<br>The round wheele turning of our Astronomie,
<br>And so the Elixer of spirits you must come: for why
<br>Till the sonne of the fixed by the sonne of the fixer be overgone,
<br>Elixer of bodies, named it is onely,
<br>And this found secret poynt, deceaveth manie one.
<p>This naturall proces by helpe of craft thus consummate,
<br>Dissolveth Elixer spiritull in our unctuous humiditie,
<br>Then in Balneo Mare together let them be circulate,
<br>Like new honie or oyle, till perfectly they be thickened.
<br>Then will that medicine heal all infirmitie,
<br>And turne all mettals to Sunne and Moone perfectly,
<br>Thus you shall make the great Elixer, and Aurum potabile,
<br>By the grace and will of God, to whom be all honour and glorie.
<p>Amen. quod George Ripley.
