      <br>
      Nowadays, I have also invented the method of purifying gold
      (Golden Dan) and Silver (Platinum Dan), which refers to the field
      of alchemy mineral gold by the water separation method or the fire
      method to purify gold and silver.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pre-national invention patents A method for purifying thousands of
      gold and silver has its technical disadvantages: it extracts gold,
      silver ore and then oxalic acid with strong water to reduce the
      gold content to 0.25% and the silver content to 0.45% to 100%. The
      weight is 0.5 grams of thousands of gold and 0.9 grams of
      milli-silver, but the method is strong water from industrial
      hydrochloric acid HCl: industrial nitric acid HNO3: industrial
      sulfuric acid H2SO4 takes the value of 1 ~ 3: 1: 0.5 ~ 1, or with
      oxalic acid 1 ~ Two parts of the purification of thousands of
      gold, thousands of silver, due to hydrochloric acid, nitric acid
      and sulfuric acid three liquid strong acid can generally be
      purchased in large cities and expensive 35 yuan / bottle, so
      transport is not convenient, and the solution releases a large
      amount of reaction heat during the preparation process, When using
      ceramic pots that are not resistant to sudden changes, it is easy
      to cause accidents and is not safe. Also, because the three acids
      are outdated, the old technology separately purifies gold and
      silver ore. The precious metal products are thousands of gold and
      thousands of silver. In the market, very few users need to
      purchase expensive 580 yuan / gram thousand gold and 35 yuan /
      gram thousand silver.<br>
      <br>
      Many scientists in ancient times and specialized in alchemy
      silversmiths dreamed of making gold and silver. For example, the
      ancient Chinese alchemy fox family has done a detailed study on
      Huang Baizhu: mixing mercury and medicinal herbs, and then mixing
      the hardware into the smelt, but Fox Gang has never succeeded in
      refining the real gold. It is copper gold and silver. For example,
      Li Shizhen, a great medical scientist of the Ming Dynasty, also
      made a careful study on Huang Baishu in his later years. He used
      medicine to make gold, silver and copper. These ancient people
      have been divided into silver furnaces to separate gold, silver
      and copper to produce gold and silver. Another example is that
      ancient Western countries specializing in the use of aqua regia
      and sodium cyanide for alchemy are very fashionable. Many royal
      palaces and nobles are engaged in alchemy. For example, scientists
      Newton gave up scientific research in his later years, specialized
      in alchemy, and finally made copper. In the case of quality gold,
      Western countries will not use silver technology to produce
      silver. They only make gold and silver, and the dreams of
      alchemists who have realized in their later years have created
      alchemy and alchemy. Whether it is ancient alchemy in China or
      alchemy in Western countries, the technical disadvantages of these
      two methods are that the fire water does not produce high-quality
      copper and silver.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the invention:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The purpose of my invention is to provide a high-tech method for
      purifying gold and silver from the alchemy mineral gold by the
      above-mentioned pre-patent and ancient technical defects.<br>
      <br>
      In order to separate and purify pure gold and pure silver from the
      raw materials of alchemy drugs, the inventors conducted industrial
      tests using the following technical solutions:<br>
      <br>
      According to the revelation of ancient alchemy in China, the
      inventors have studied the purification of gold and silver for
      fifteen years, and determined that some alchemy drugs can be
      refined to purify pure gold and silver. The secret recipe of
      alchemy is preferably oxalic acid chemical composition H2C2O4·
      2H2O content is 40%, urea chemical composition (NH2)2CO content is
      99%, strontium sand chemical composition NH4Cl content is 99%, and
      saltpeter chemical composition KNO3 content is 99%. The specific
      formula ratio of the four-flavored alchemy drug in the operation
      is 1: 2:1:1, the reducing drug used consists of iron tablets,
      borax, and the amount of light reaction is 3 times the
      stoichiometric amount. The gold and silver (platinum) are purified
      by water fire.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor of the present invention mines gold ore in the
      alluvial layer of the dry river, and measures 30% of gold, 40% of
      silver, and 30% of impurities such as silica by spectroscopy, and
      after smashing, sieving and mixing, using a pot of pottery Fill
      the water, take the gold ore powder, wash it with a spoonful of
      shovel, and remove the impurities as the water rotates up and
      down. The gold and silver chips sink to the bottom and discard the
      water. Take the gold and silver chips in the solid-liquid ratio of
      8:1, take the alchemy alchemy drug oxalic acid: urea: 硇 sand: salt
      stone value 1: 2: 1:1 total 20g beaker, add 8 times of water, stir
      evenly, adjust PH =7.0, capping, placed on the fire for 35 minutes
      to boil, and then extracted for 15 minutes, the gold is completely
      reacted by the sulphate oxidation to form a solution of urea
      oxalic acid niobium nitrate and nitrate into the solution, and the
      silver dissolved in the prescription reacts with the strontium
      sand. Impurities such as silver chloride and silica precipitate a
      layer of white matter at the bottom of the pot. Filtration of the
      gold oxalic acid urea sand and saltpeter complex solution using a
      stoichiometric 3 times iron sheet to reduce the gold
      precipitation, the silver precipitated silver at the bottom of the
      pot is placed in a coal stove and reduced to pure silver by a
      stoichiometric 3 times iron sheet. In this way, gold and silver
      are purified from the raw gold through the water and fire.<br>
      <br>
      The beneficial effects of my invention:<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the pre-invention patent purifying thousand-foot
      gold and thousand-foot silver, the inventors purify the true gold
      and silver method by adding oxalic acid, ammonium salt, urea sand
      and oxidant saltpeter to form a four-flavor solid alchemy drug,
      which is easy to purchase at a local price of 17 yuan/kg. When it
      is convenient to transport and is prepared in a ceramic pot with
      high temperature resistance, since the four alchemy drugs are
      solid and the reaction heat is not released, the inventor's
      advanced high-tech science and technology can mature and separate
      the gold from the mineral gold. Silver; pure gold and pure silver
      have softer properties. With the continuous advancement of modern
      high-tech, the industry is widely used in artificial flying
      saucers, aerospace, aviation, electronics, telecommunications, and
      gold and silver vessels, so there are more and more users in the
      market. Purchase cheaper 350 yuan / gram of pure gold Au and 10
      yuan / gram of pure silver Ag.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the synthetic gold and symbiotic silver produced by
      ancient Chinese alchemy yellow atractylodes and Western national
      alchemy, the inventors realized high-tech science and technology
      for purifying gold and silver alchemy alchemy drugs when they were
      young, and were able to mature from raw gold minerals. The
      stagnation of water and fire is not only a dream, but also a great
      revolution in the history of high-tech science and technology
      precious metal mining and metallurgy.<br>
      <b><br>

      The mercuryless gold-smelting method is characterized by that the
      gold ore and fluxing agent are mixed, then placed in the cokes of
      gold-smelting furnace, smelted at high temp., then the molten ore
      is fallen into an inverted conical casting mould, and is mixed
      with another portion of fluxing agent being in the bottom of the
      casting mould, so that the heavy and light metals are separated,
      and the metal with small specific weight floats upwards and
      overflows from overflow gate, and the metal with large specific
      weight is settled on the bottom of the casting mould, and after it
      is set-hardened, the tip portion containing gold of the bottom of
      the casting mould is cut out. Said method is simple, has no toxic
      side effect, and is safe in operation and its smelting yield is
      raised to 90%.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional method of alchemy is to dissolve minerals by
      cyanate and then separate them with mercury. Cyanate and mercury
      are toxic substances, which are dangerous to operate. The
      by-products are environmentally polluting and harmful, and the
      gold extraction rate is low.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide a mercury-free
      gold-smelting method and apparatus for avoiding environmental
      pollution, reducing operational risk, and improving the gold
      extraction rate, overcoming the deficiencies of the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      The design idea of the invention is: gold ore is mixed with flux,
      high temperature smelting, using the role of flux, ore component
      begins to melt and fall at 1100 ° C, the role of flux is to
      accelerate heat conduction, accelerate the melting of gold ore,
      and melt More complete, and can dilute the molten metal melt, so
      that various metal melts can be naturally separated according to
      their specific gravity.<br>
      <br>
      The flux used was carbon powder, borax, silica and sodium
      carbonate. The mechanism of action of flux and gold ore is: the
      role of borax is to separate the gold component from the impurity
      component at high temperature, and to form a melt at 600 ° C,
      accelerate heat conduction and suspend impurity components; Alkali
      erosion, so that borax can function more fully; the action of
      carbon powder continues to get heat from the components that are
      not completely melted, forming a sufficient melt; the role of
      silica is to make the flux form a melt of the vitreous to conduct
      heat And suspending impurities.<br>
      <br>
      The technical proposal of the invention is that the gold ore and a
      part of the flux are mixed and placed in a coke oven, the furnace
      temperature is between 1300 and 1400 ° C, and lasts for 20 to 30
      minutes, and the molten ore falls into the inverted conical mold,
      and the mold is molded. Another part of the flux is mixed, further
      action, so that the falling metal solution is more completely
      melted and diluted, utilizing the specific gravity of gold
      compared with other metals, heavy and light metal separation,
      metal with a small specific gravity floating, from the slag The
      mouth overflows, depositing a more significant metal at the bottom
      of the mold, and after solidification, intercepts the
      gold-containing portion of the tip.<br>
      <br>
      The flux composition used is: silica:carbon powder:borax:sodium
      carbonate is 1:5-15:25-3.5:1-4.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of the flux to the gold ore is 1:8-12.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus used for the above-mentioned alchemy is a melting
      furnace, the furnace body is placed on a furnace seat, and an
      inverted conical mold is placed in the middle of the furnace seat,
      and the furnace in the furnace body is aligned with the casting
      mold so that the molten ore falls into the mold. There is a slag
      hole on the furnace seat and the mold side, and a blast hole is
      left on the side wall of the furnace body.<br>
      <br>
      The invention does not need to dissolve ore with cyanate, and does
      not need to be separated by mercury, so there is no danger of
      operation, no toxic side effects, no environmental pollution;
      direct use of high temperature melting simplifies the smelting
      process, due to the action of high temperature and flux The ore
      components are completely dissolved and separated, the refining
      rate can be increased from 78% to 90% of the mercury refining
      process, and the gold ingot can be re-fired multiple times.<br>
      <br>
      The drawings are the alchemy equipment of the present invention.<br>

      deposited in the mold. When the slag port 7 stops the slag, the
      ore is completely melted and the furnace is shut down. After
      cooling, the mold was taken out, the ingot was taken out, and the
      tip portion was taken out according to the calculated gold
      content.<br>
      <br>
      The co-solvent mixed with the ore placed in the upper part of the
      furnace is 50% of the total flux, and the flux at the bottom of
      the mold is 50%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>

      inverted conical mold 4, and the flux 6 is composed of
      silica:carbon powder:borax:sodium carbonate: 1:5:3.5:4, at the
      bottom of the furnace body 1 and The coke is placed in the
      periphery, and a mixture of the crushed ore 2 and the flux 6 is
      placed in the upper middle portion of the furnace body 1, and is
      ignited before the slag hole 7. After the bottom coke is
      completely ignited, the blower is blown and forced to be burned to
      make the furnace temperature Increasing to 1300 ~ 1400 ° C, and
      lasting for 20 ~ 3 minutes, the ore component begins to melt at
      1100 ° C under the action of flux, falling to the inverted conical
      mold 4, further action of the other part of the flux 6 through the
      bottom To make the falling molten metal melt and dilute more
      completely. As the falling melt increases, the metal with a
      smaller specific gravity falls down than the metal, and the molten
      metal rises to the overflow in the inverted conical mold 4. At the
      slag mouth, the light scum overflows from the slag port 7 and the
      heavy metal components are still deposited step by step in the
      inverted conical mold. When the slag port 7 stops the slag, the
      ore is completely melted, the furnace is cooled, the mold is taken
      out, and the ingot is taken out, and the calculated gold content
      is taken from the tip end portion.<br>

      air. The cooling air flow can be closed without any consideration,
      so that the cooling air can be closed in the furnace without
      increasing the exhaust gas emission. The furnace wall can be
      controlled to cool, and the residual heat of the smelting furnace

      melting chamber by the radiation, the airflow continuously blown
      into the melting chamber is carried away, so that the temperature
      of the inner wall of the melting chamber is not high, and the heat
      transfer direction of the heat convection is in the same direction
      as the moving direction of the airflow, and the heat conduction is
      transmitted. The heat rate is much lower than the speed of the
      airflow, so the heat is constantly carried away by the air stream
      blown into the melting chamber and carried into the column to
      maintain a relatively low temperature inside the wall of the
      melting chamber. The cooling of the traditional kiln wall is
      generally cooled by the outer wall, the heat is transferred
      through the furnace wall to achieve heat balance, causing a large
      amount of energy loss, and also causing the burning of the furnace
      wall. Due to material limitation, higher temperatures cannot be
      achieved in the furnace. The embodiment realizes the cooling of
      the inner wall surface of the furnace wall, avoids energy loss,
      avoids burning of the inner surface of the furnace wall, solves
      the problem of creation and control of the high temperature
      environment, and solves the problem of the furnace material.<br>

      coal is sprayed into the upper portion of the melting chamber to
      maintain combustion in the upper portion of the melting chamber,
      and peroxygen combustion is formed to completely burn off the gas
      formed in the melting chamber in the upper portion of the melting
      chamber. At the top of the melting chamber, it is not necessary to
      spray carbon powder, only oxygen is blown in, so that the gas can
      be fully burned out. At the bottom of the melting chamber, fuel
      can be injected or less fuel can be injected, and an appropriate
      amount of smelting furnace exhaust gas can be blown to cool the
      molten metal, thereby preventing the refractory material from
