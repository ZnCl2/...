<i>NOTE.</i>
<p>In presenting the "Virgin of the World" --- which with my "Hargrave
Jennings" Edition of the "<i>Divine Pymander</i>," now so much in repute
and demand, are the text books of Hermetic thought --- it is no act of
supererogation to gratefully acknowledge my appreciation of the valued
services of all associated with me in the privileged task of once again
reviving those priceless writings of that "Master Initiate," "Hermes Mercurius
Trismegistus;" (to be shortly supplemented by the Third Volume, or "<i>Golden
Treatise concerning the Physical Secret of the Philosopher's Stone, in
seven sections</i>," esteemed one of the best and oldest pieces of Alchemical
Philosophy extant; comprising, in epitome, the whole Art, and secret method
of its confection, with corroborative annotations from Fludd, Behmem, Vaughan,
&amp;c.

<br><b><font size=+1>The Hermetic Books.</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>THE Sacred Books of Hermes, says Mrs. Child in her admirable compendium,
[1] containing the laws, science, and theology of Egypt, were declared
by the priests to have been composed during the reign of the Gods, preceding
that of their first king, Menes. Allusions on very ancient monuments prove
their great antiquity. There were four of them, and the sub-divisions of
the whole make forty-two volumes. These numbers correspond exactly to those
of the Vedas, which the Puranas say were carried into Egypt by the Yadavas
at the first emigration to that country from Hindostan. The subjects treated
of in them were likewise similar; but how far the Books of Hermes were
copied from the Vedas remains doubtful. They were deposited in the inmost
holy recesses of the temples, and none but the higher order of priests
were allowed to read them. They were carried reverently in all great religious
processions. The chief priests carried ten volumes relating to the emanations
of the Gods, the formation of the world, the divine annunciation of laws
and rules for the priesthood. The prophets carried four, treating of astronomy
and astrology. The leader of the sacred musicians carried two, containing
hymns to the Gods, and maxims to guide the conduct of the king, which the
chanter was required to know by heart. Such were the reputed antiquity
and sanctity of these Egyptian hymns that Plato says they were ascribed
to Isis, and believed to be ten thousand years old. Servitors of the temple
carried ten volumes more, containing forms of prayer and rules for offerings,
festivals, and processions. The other volumes treated of philosophy and
the sciences, including anatomy and medicine.
<p>These books were very famous, and later were much sought after for alchemical
purposes, especially for that of making gold. The Roman Emperor Severus
collected all writings on the Mysteries and buried them in the tomb of
Alexander the Great; and Diocletian destroyed all their books on alchemy
lest Egypt should become too rich to remain tributary to Rome. The once-renowned
Books of Hermes have been lost these fifteen hundred years.
<p>Thus much concerning the Hermetic Books generally.
<p>The Fragments comprised in this reprint have been the subject of much
learned research. In the early centuries of Christianity --- Dr. Louis
Menard tells us [1] --- they enjoyed a high repute as of undoubted genuineness,
the Fathers invoking their testimony on behalf of the Christian mysteries,
while Lactantius --- the "Christian Cicero" --- said of them, "Hermes,
I know not how, has discovered well-nigh the whole truth." He was regarded
as an inspired revealer, and the writings which bore his name passed for
genuine monuments of that ancient Egyptian theology in which Moses had
been instructed. And this opinion was accepted by Massilius Ficinus, Patricius,
and other learned men of the Renaissance, who regarded them as the source
of the Orphic initiations and of the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato.
Doubts, however, arose. They were ascribed, variously, on the strength
of internal evidence, to a Jew, a Christian, and a Gnostic. And the conclusion
come to by recent critics and accepted by Dr. Menard, is that their place
is among the latest productions of Greek philosophy, but that amid the
Alexandrian ideas, on which they are based, there are some traces of the
religious doctrine of ancient Egypt. It was, he says, from the conjunction
of the religious doctrines of Egypt, with the philosophic doctrines of
Greece, that the Egyptian philosophy sprang which has left no other memorial
than the books of Hermes, in which are to be recognised, under an abstract
form, the ideas and tendencies which had before been presented under a
mythological form.
<p>Another comparison is that which he institutes between some of the Hermetic
writings and the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, especially the Book of
Genesis and the fourth Gospel, and the works of Philo and the Shepherd
of Hernias. [1] "The advent of Christianity presents at first sight the
appearance of a radical revolution in the manners and beliefs of the Western
World. But history knows nothing of sudden changes and unanticipated transformations.
To comprehend the passage from one religion to another, one should not
contrast their two extreme terms--the Homeric mythology and the Nicene
symbology. It is necessary to study their intermediate remains --- the
multiple products of an epoch of transition, when the primitive Hellenism,
under philosophical discussion, changed more and more by admixture with
the religions of the East, which were then confused by advancing upon Europe.
Christianity represents the latest terms of this incursion of Oriental
conceptions into the West. It did not fall like a thunderbolt into the
midst of an old world surprised and aghast. It had its period of incubation;
and while it sought a definitive form for its doctrines, the problems,
the solution of which it sought, equally preoccupied the minds of Greece,
Asia, and Egypt. The ideas were already in the air, which became combined
in every kind of proportion.
<p>"The multiplicity of the sects springing up in our days can give but
a slight notion of that astonishing intellectual chemistry which had established
its chief laboratory at Alexandria. Humanity had put up to competition
vast moral and philosophical issues --- the origin of evil, the destiny
of souls, their fall and their redemption; the prize offered was the dictatorship
of consciences. The Christian solution prevailed."
<p>Our critic proceeds to distinguish in the books of Hermes Trismegistus
between that which, in his view, belonged respectively to Egypt and to
Judea. "When we meet in these books," he remarks, "Platonist or Pythagorean
ideas, we must ask whether the author had recovered them from the ancient
sources whence Pythagoras or Plato had drawn them before him; or whether
they represent an element purely Greek. There is, then, room to discuss
the influence, real or supposed, of the East on the Hellenic philosophy.
One is generally too liable, on the strength of the belief of the Greeks
themselves, to exaggerate this influence, and especially to set back the
date of it. It is only after the foundation of Alexandria that a permanent
and consistent connection was established between the thought of Greece
and that of other peoples; and in these exchanges Greece had much more
to give than to receive. The Orientals --- at least, such of them as came
into contact with the Greeks--appeared never to have had a philosophy properly
so called. Psychic analysis, research for the foundations of knowledge
and of moral laws, and their application to social life, were things absolutely
unknown to the East before the invasion of Alexander. The expression respecting
his countrymen which Plato ascribes to the Egyptian priest, 'You Greeks
are but children; and there are no old men among you,' might be referred
to the East and to Egypt itself. The scientific spirit is as alien to those
peoples as the political instinct. They can endure, through long ages,
but they can never reach their manhood. They are elderly youths, always
in leading strings, and as incapable of searching for truth as of accomplishing
justice.
<p>"Initiated into philosophy by Greece, the East could but give in return
that which it had, --- the exaltation of religious sentiment; Greece accepted
the exchange. Weary of the scepticism produced by the strife of her schools,
she cast herself, by a reaction, into mystic fervours, precursors of a
renewal of faith. The books of Hermes Trismegistus are a bond of union
between the dogmas of the past and those of a future, and it is by this
bond that they attach themselves to questions actual and living. If they
belong still to paganism, it is to paganism in its last hours, always full
of disdain for the new faith, and declining to abdicate in her favour,
because it guards the depository of the old civilisation which will become
extinct with it, already tired of a hopeless struggle, resigned to its
destiny, and returning to sleep for evermore in its first cradle, the old
Egypt, the land of the dead."
<p>Dr. Menard thus concludes: --- "The Hermetic books are the last monuments
of paganism. They belong at once to the Greek philosophy and the Egyptian
religion, and in their mystic exaltation they impinge already upon the
Middle Age. Between a world which is ending and a world which is commencing,
they resemble those animals who by their undecided nature serve as a link
between different orders of organisations. These mixed creations are always
inferior to each of the groups which they connect together. Not to be compared
either with the religion of Homer or Christianity, the Books of Hermes
enable us to comprehend the method of the world's passage from one to the
other. In them the beliefs which were being born, and, the beliefs which
were dying, met and clasped hands."
<p>In contrast to, and also, as we hold, in correction of, the view thus
expressed concerning the relative philosophies of Greece and the East,
we adduce the following passages from Mr. Plumptre's "<i>History of Pantheism</i>":
---&nbsp; [1]
<p>"From our earliest childhood we have generally been taught to regard
the Hebrews as those to whom we owe all our knowledge of theology and religion;
and in a great measure even our knowledge of God Himself. We have been
taught to regard the Greeks as those from whom we have gained all our acquaintance
with the arts and sciences, philosophy, and, to a certain extent, all that
is comprised within the word wisdom. And in like manner it is upon the
Romans we have been told to look as upon those from whom we have gained
all our notions of discipline and law. As regards our relations to the
Hebrews and Romans, the definition is fairly accurate. Not so with the
Greeks. There is, indeed, a certain superficial accuracy about the statement.
We do, of course, owe a good deal of our knowledge and learning to the
Greeks. But where the definition is erroneous is in this: it leads us to
imply from it that the Greeks were the first people who cultivated the
love of learning for its own sake; that they gained their knowledge from
no other nations, but were the authors of it themselves. It might almost
lead us to imply that they were the first people who had ever attained
any degree of civilisation.
<p>"The slightest acquaintance with Egyptian or Hindoo history is sufficient
to make us detect such an obvious fallacy, and lead us readily to discredit
the assertion. The civilisation of Egypt goes so far back in the world's
history that it is almost impossible to say when it began. It is almost
generally acknowledged now that Moses gained the greater portion of his
knowledge from his connection with the Egyptians; and in that case even
our first ideas of religion may be traced to an Egyptian source."
<p>Mr. Plumptre goes on to spew that while the Hindoos and Egyptians had
long been in possession of religio-philosophical systems of the highest
intellectual order, the Greeks were sunk in ignorance and superstition
of the most irrational kind, until the occurrence of an event which revolutionised,
or, rather, which gave the first impulse to Greek thought, so that in a
short time after it Greece sprang from a state of childish ignorance into
one in which she became, both commercially and philosophically, the leading
power of the world. This momentous event was the opening of the Egyptian
ports by Psammetichus, B.C. 670. Previous to that time, the Egyptians had
been shut out from all intercourse with Europe and the Mediterranean by
an exclusion more rigorous than that which until lately was practised in
China and Japan; and Egypt was to the Greeks but a land of mystery and
fable, as witness the allusions to it in Homer and Hesiod. But with the
system of isolation overthrown which had prevailed for so many thousands
of years, the influence of the event upon the progress of Europe was such
as to be incapable of exaggeration. First Greece, then the rest of the
world, owed their civilisation to it. It destroyed the belief in the old
mythologies, and gave birth to Greek philosophy.
<p>There is one respect in which this statement requires modification.
The Greek mythologies may indeed have been but irrational fables as popularly
received and without the key to their interpretation. But in reality they
were symbols denoting, while concealing, profound occult truths. And while
their presence in Greece at so early a period shews that colleges of the
Sacred Mysteries flourished there long before the rise of Greek philosophy,
the identity of the doctrines they symbolised with those of Egypt and the
East shews that there had been religious intercourse between these countries
long before there was any political, commercial, or philosophical intercourse.
Foreign missionary enterprise by no means originated with Christianity.
The Sacred Mysteries were continually migrating and planting themselves
in new ground in advance of secular civilisation. The migration of Abraham
and the flights of Bacchus and of Moses were doubtless all of them events
of this character.
<p>Mr. Plumtre's conclusion that whatever there was of coincidence between
Greek and Egyptian philosophic thought was due to the recognition and adoption
of the latter by the Greeks, is one which it seems to us impossible to
escape. And we regard M. Menard's inferences to the contrary as due to
his failure to combine with his classical knowledge a knowledge of Hermetic
and Kabbalistic methods and traditions. Comprising as do these the world's
spiritual history, it is impossible apart from them to form any sound judgment
on the matters in question. Those who, enamoured of conventional methods,
are unable to recognise any organon of knowledge except the superficial
faculties, or any plane of knowledge transcending the range of those faculties,
are necessarily intolerant of the idea that there has been in the world
from the earliest times a system of esoteric and positive doctrine concerning
the most hidden mysteries of Existence, of such a character, and so obtained
as to fulfil all the conditions requisite to constitute a divine revelation.
Nevertheless, this is the conclusion to which we have found ourselves compelled
by sheer force of evidence, at once exoteric and esoteric. It is in Hindostan
and Egypt that we find its earliest traces; and if, as assuredly is the
case, there are coincidences between the ancient doctrines of those lands,
and those of Greece, Jud&aelig;a, and Christendom, it is because the same
truth has passed from people to people, everywhere finding recognition,
and undergoing re-formulation according to the genius of the time and place
of its sojourn. And this, we may add, is a process which must inevitably
continue until man has become either so far degenerate as to lose all care
for and perception of truth; or so far regenerate as to attain to the full
perception of it, and fix it for evermore as his most precious possession.
<p>But be this as it may, we have seen that even the most destructive criticism
is forced to make these three important admissions
<p>(1) That the doctrine contained in the Hermetic books is in part, at
least, a survival from the times of ancient Egypt, and therein really Hermetic.
<p>(2) That there is a coincidence between the doctrine which has thus
survived and that of Christianity. And,
<p>(3) That this coincidence has been recognised and welcomed by the Church,
to the admission that Christianity, so far from being something wholly
new and unprecedented at the time of its inception, represents a development
from, or re-formulation of; doctrine long pre-existent.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Hermetic System and the Significance of its Present
Revival.</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>TO the philosophical student of humanity the most significant and important
feature of the present remarkable epoch is, unquestionably, the revival
of Occult Science and Mystical, or Esoteric, Philosophy. The significance
is due no less to the character of the period of its occurrence, than to
that of the subject itself. For the moment chosen has been one wherein
the human mind, as represented by the recognised intellect of the age,
had become, to all appearance, irrevocably set in the opposite direction
--- that of materialism. Happily, however, for humanity, such appearance
has proved deceptive, as had already been foreseen would be the case by
those "watchers for the day," who, recognising the unity of nature, and
vitalised on the higher planes of the consciousness, are able to forecast
the processes of the mental world by those of the physical. That it is
always when the sun is at its lowest point that the day and the year are
reborn, is no less true in the world spiritual than in the world material.
And while the prevalence of materialism meant the extinction of man's spiritual
consciousness, the revival of occult and mystical science means the restoration
of that consciousness. History, too, had its lessons of encouragement for
them, by shewing that the passing away of old forms of faith is wont to
be the prognostic and condition of new and higher manifestations. Hence
they had confidence that the Spirit of Humanity, being, as they well knew,
real and divine, would, in its own good time, make effectual protest against
the extinction threatened; and are able to recognise in the present revival
the form which that protest has taken.
<p>The significance of this event is definitely enhanced by the facts,
first, that it has brought the Hermetic philosophy into a prominence which
it has not known for many centuries; and, secondly, that the revival of
that philosophy has been at once the condition and the result of every
great religious renaissance the world has seen. For the system designated
the Hermetic Gnosis--the earliest formulation of which, for the western
world, belongs to the pre-historic times of ancient Egypt --- has constituted
the core of all the religio-philosophical systems of both east and west,
Buddhism and Christianity, among others, being alike intended as vehicles
for and expressions of it, though the fact has been recognised by only
the initiated few. The great school of scholastic mysticism which was the
glory of the church of the Middle Ages, had, although unavowedly, the same
basis. This school represented a strenuous and sustained endeavour to rescue
religion from the exclusive domain of the historical and the ceremonial,
and the control of a sacerdotalism, grossly materialistic and idolatrous,
by restoring its proper intuitional and spiritual character. That the endeavour
failed to secure a lasting success, and the church of the Middle Ages continued
to sink deeper and deeper into superstition, with its usual accompaniment
of religious persecution, was due to no fault of the system itself. This
requires for its reception, that the spiritual consciousness of the many
should have attained a development hitherto possessed only by the few.
And the world was not then ripe for a doctrine which represents reason
in its highest mode. History thus shows that the revival we are witnessing
now, is but one of a series of revivals, all having the same object; and
it may be confidently anticipated, that, under the altered conditions of
society, the success attained will far surpass any yet achieved. For, gloomy
as is the present outlook in every department of human activity, social,
philosophical, moral, and religious alike, there never was a time when
the conditions were so favourable for a radical and widespread improvement;
because there never was a time when new ideas and knowledges found such
facilities for propagation, or when, through the intensity of their suffering
and discontent, mankind were in so high a state of receptivity. Hence the
system has now a chance of recognition surpassing any hitherto enjoyed
by it. Having always in the past found exclusive favour with the most luminous
minds and noblest natures, it can hardly fail, with due formulation and
presentation, to find acceptance with the mankind of the incoming era.
Already are there indications not to be mistaken, that the still powerful
aid of the church will not be wanting in this behalf, and this no less
for its own preservation than for that of religious truth. The world has
yet to discern the significance of the action of Pope Leo XIII., in the
reinstatement of the writings of Aquinas as the basis of ecclesiastical
education. But for the initiates of Hermes this is not doubtful, but affords
sure ground for the loftiest hopes. And similarly with that extraordinary,
if too often grotesque, phenomenon called modern spiritualism.
<p>From these remarks on the circumstances under which the revival has
occurred, of which this series of reprints is at once a product, a token,
and an aid; we will proceed to give a slight general sketch of the nature
of the doctrine which has played so important a part in the past, and bids
fair to do as much, and even more, in the future.
<p>It should be first stated, however, that the materials for our sketch
are not restricted to the so-called Hermetic fragments themselves, which
form the subject of these reprints. Not only are they, as fragments, incomplete;
they are also interpolated and partially corrupt in text, though still
replete with the purest and loftiest teaching. Much, too, of that which
is genuine is mystical and allegorical, referring to a plane, and needing
an interpretation, other than are apparent. Hence, it is necessary for
such a task, to utilise the labours of those various exponents of the system
who have either derived it from sources not now extant, or who, by following
the same method, have discerned it for themselves, [1] giving it, in some
instances, fresh applications, not the less Hermetic because representing
a further development of the doctrine. No learning or industry, however,
can compensate for the absence of that sympathetic insight which alone
can detect the characteristic ring of the true Hermetic metal; and which,
if hearty appreciation be any guarantee, will assuredly not be wholly wanting
on this occasion. At best, however, it is but a slight outline that can
be given here.
<p>Starting from the axiom that from nothing nothing comes, and recognising
Consciousness as the indispensable condition of existence, the Gnosis,
with resistless logic, derives all things from pure and absolute Being,
itself unmanifest and unconditioned, but in the infinity of its plenitude
and energy, possessing and exercising the potentiality of manifestation
and conditionment, and being, rather than having, life, substance, and
mind, comprised in one Divine Selfhood, of which the universe is the manifestation.
<p>Regarding all things as modes of consciousness, the Gnosis necessarily
regards consciousness as subsisting under many modes, and as being definable
as the property whereby whatever is, affects, or is affected in, itself;
or affects, or is affected by, another; which is really to say, as constituting
the things them-selves. There is, thus, a mechanical consciousness, a chemical
consciousness, a magnetic, a mental, a psychic, consciousness, and so on
up to the divine, or absolute, consciousness. And whereas all proceed from
this last, so all return to this last, in that every entity possesses the
potentiality of it. Herein lies the secret of evolution, which is no other
than the expression of the tendency of things to revert, by ascension,
to their original condition--a tendency, and therefore an expression, which
could have no being were the lowest, or material mode of consciousness
to be the original and normal mode.
<p>By thus making matter itself a mode of consciousness, and therein of
spirit --- spirit being absolute consciousness --- the Gnosis escapes at
once the difficulties which stand in the way of the conception of an original
Dualism, consisting of principles inherently antagonistic; and also those
which arise out of the kindred conception of non-consciousness as having
a positive existence. All being modes of the One, no inherent antagonism,
or essential difference, is possible; but that which is regarded as unconsciousness
is but a lower mode of consciousness--consciousness reduced, so to speak,
to a minimum, but still consciousness so long as it is. Total unconsciousness
is thus not-being; and bears to consciousness the relation of darkness
to light, the latter alone of the two being, however reduced, positive
entity, and darkness being non-entity.
<p>However various the manifestations of the universal consciousness, or
being, whether as regards its different planes, or its different modes
on the same plane, they all are according to one and the same law, which,
by its uniformity, demonstrates the unity of the informing spirit, or mind,
which subsists eternally and independently of any manifestation. For, as
said in the "<i>Divine Pymander</i>" (B.V.):---
<p>"He needeth not to be manifested; for He subsisteth eternally.
<p>"But in that He is One, He is not made nor generated; but is unapparent
and unmanifest.
<p>"But by making all things appear, He appeareth in all and by all; but
especially is He manifested to or in those wherein He willeth."
<p>And again:--
<p>"The Essence of all is One."
<p>From the oneness of original Being comes, as a corollary, the law of
correspondence between all planes, or spheres, of existence, in virtue
of which the macrocosm is as the microcosm, the universal as the individual,
the world as man, and man as God. "An earthly man," says "The Key," "is
a mortal God, and the heavenly God is immortal man." The same book, however,
is careful to explain that by man is meant only those men who are possessed
of the higher intelligence, or spiritual consciousness, and that to lack
this is to be not yet man, but only the potentiality of man. It avoids
also the error of anthropomorphism by defining Divinity to be, itself,
neither life, nor mind, nor substance; but the cause of these.
<p>Ignorance of God is pronounced to be the greatest evil, but God is not
to be discerned in phenomena, or with the outer eye. The quest must be
made within oneself. In order to know, man must first be. This is to say,
he must have developed in himself the consciousness of all the planes,
or spheres, of his fourfold nature, and become thereby wholly man. It is
to his inmost and divine part, the spirit, that the mystery of existence
appertains, since that is Pure Being, of which existence is the manifestation.
And, as man can recognise without him, that only which he has within him,
it is essential to his perception of spiritual things that he be himself
spiritual. "The natural man," says the apostle Paul, following at once
the Hermetists and the Kabbalists, who are at one in both doctrine and
method, and differ only in form, "receiveth not the things of the Spirit,
neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned," that is,
by the spiritual part in man. In such degree as man developer this consciousness
he becomes an organon of knowledge, capable of obtaining certitude of truth,
even the highest; and from being "agnostic" and incapable of knowledge,
he becomes "Gnostic," or has the Gnosis, which consists in the knowledge
of himself and of God, and of the substantial identity of the two.
<p>From this it is obvious that what is demonstrated by the agnosticism
of the present age, is simply the immaturity of its professors. This is
to say, the philosophy of the day represents the conclusions of men, who,
how developed soever intellectually, are still rudimentary in respect of
the spiritual consciousness, and fall short, therefore, of their spiritual
and true manhood--the manhood which belongs to the highest plane. Being
to such extent not human but subhuman, and ignorant of the meaning and
potentialities of man, they confound form with substance, and mistake the
exterior and phenomenal part of man for man himself, and imagine accordingly
that to gratify this part is necessarily to benefit the man, no matter
how subversive of the real humanity the practices to which they have recourse.
Out of this condition of spiritual darkness the Gnosis lifts man, and,
giving him the supreme desideratum --- which it is the object of all divine
revelation to supply --- a definition of himself, demonstrates to him,
with scientific certainty, the supremacy of the moral law, and the impossibility
either of getting good by doing evil, or of escaping the penalty of the
latter. The attempt to get good by evil doing only puts him back, making
his fate worse. The doctrine of Karma is no less Hermetic than Hind&ucirc;,
the equivalent term in the former being Adrast&eacute;, a goddess to whom
is committed the administration of justice. In the Greek pantheon she appears
as Nemesis and Hecate. They all represent that inexorable law of cause
and effect in things moral, in virtue of which man's nature and conditions
in the future are the result of the tendencies voluntarily encouraged by
him in the past and present. The Hermetic method to the attainment of perfection,
on whatever plane --- physical, intellectual, moral, or spiritual --- is
purity. Not merely having, but being, consciousness, man is man, and is
percipient, according to the measure in which he is pure; perfect purity
implying full perception, even to the seeing of God, as the gospels have
it. In the same proportion he has also power. The fully initiated Hermetist
is a magian, or man of power, and can work what to the world seem miracles,
and those on all planes --- physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual
--- by force of his own will. But his only secret of over is purity, as
his only motive is love. For the power with which he operates is spirit,
and spirit is keen and mighty in proportion as it is pure. Absolutely pure
spirit is God. Hence the miracles of the magian, as distinguished from
the magician, are really worked by God --- the God in and of the man.
<p>A word on the organon of Hermetic knowledge. This is emphatically the
mode of the mind termed the intuition. Following this in its centripetal
course, man comes into such relations with his own essential and permanent
self --- the soul --- as to be able to receive from her the knowledges
she has acquired of divine things in the long ages of her past. But this
implies no disparagement to the mind's other and centrifugal mode, the
intellect. This also must be developed and trained to the utmost, as the
complement, supplement, and indispensable mate of the intuition --- the
man to its woman. Perfecting and combining these two, and only thus, man
knows all things and perpetuates himself. For he knows God, and to know
God is to have, and to be, God, and "the gift of God is eternal life."
<p>A foremost Hermetic doctrine is that of the soul's multiple re-births
into a physical body. Only when the process of regeneration--an Hermetic
term--is sufficiently advanced to enable the spiritual entity, which constitutes
the true individual, to dispense with further association with the body,
is lie finally freed from the necessity of a return into materiality. The
doctrine of correspondence here finds one of its most striking illustrations,
but one which nevertheless was wholly missed by the chief modern restorer
and exponent of that doctrine, Emmanuel Swedenborg. This is the correspondence
in virtue of which, just as the body uses up and sheds many times its external
covering of integument, plumage, shell, or hair, to say nothing of its
artificial clothing, so the soul wears out and sheds many bodies. The law
of gravitation, moreover, pervades all planes, the spiritual as well as
the physical; and it is according to his spiritual density that the plane
of the individual is determined, and his condition depends. The tendency
which brings a soul once into the body must be exhausted before the soul
is able to dispense with the body. The death of the body is no indication
that the tendency has been overcome, so that the soul will not be again
attracted to earth. But it is only the soul that thus returns; not the
magnetic or "astral" body which constitutes the external personality.
<p>Such is the rationale of the orthodox doctrine of transmigration, according
alike to the Hermetic, the Kabbalistic, and the Hindu systems. It permeates,
occultly, the whole of the Bible, and is implied in the teaching of Jesus
to Nicodemus, the whole of which, as is also the entire Christian presentation,
is, in its interior sense, Hermetic. Not that the new birth insisted on
by Jesus is other than purely spiritual; but it involves a multiplicity
of physical re-births as necessary to afford the requisite space and experiences
for the accomplishment of the spiritual process declared to be essential
to salvation. Seeing that regeneration must --- as admitted by Swedenborg--have
its commencement while in the body, and must also be carried on to a certain
advanced stage before the individual can dispense with the body, and also
that it denotes a degree of spiritual maturity far beyond the possibility
of attainment in a single, or an early, incarnation; it is obvious that
without a multiplicity of re-births to render regeneration possible, the
gospel message would be one, not of salvation, but of perdition, to the
race at large. What is theologically termed the "forgiveness of sins" is
dependent upon the accomplishment in the individual of the process of regeneration,
of which man, as Hermetically expressed, has the seed, or potentiality,
in himself, and in the development of which he must co-operate. Doing this,
he becomes "a new creature," in that he is re-born, not of corruptible
matter, but of "water and the spirit," namely, his own soul and spirit
purified and become divine. Thus re-constituted on the interior and higher
plane of the spirit, he is said to be born of the "Virgin Mary" and the
Holy Ghost."
<p>While purely mystical and spiritual, as opposed to historical and ceremonial,
the Hermetic system is distinguished from other schools of mysticism by
its freedom from their gloomy and churlish manner of regarding nature,
and their contempt and loathing for the body and its functions as inherently
impure and vile; [1] and so far from repudiating the relations of the sexes,
it exalts them as symbolising the loftiest divine mysteries, and enjoins
their exercise as a duty, the fulfilment of which, in some at least of
his incarnations, is essential to the full perfectionment and initiation
of the individual. It is thus pervaded by an appreciation of beauty and
joyousness of tone which at once assimilates it to the Greek, and distinguishes
it from the Oriental, conception of existence, and so redeems mysticism
from the reproach --- too often deserved --- of pessimism. The Hermetist,
like the prophet who found God in the sea's depths and the while's belly,
recognises divinity in every region and department of nature. And seeing
in "ignorance of God the greatest of all evils," [2] he seeks to perfect
himself, not simply in order the sooner to escape from existence as a thing
inherently evil, but to make himself an instrument of perception capable
of "seeing God" in every region of existence in which he may turn his gaze.
The pessimism ascribed to some Hermetic utterances, especially in the "Divine
Pymander," is but apparent, not real, and implies only the comparative
imperfection of existence as contrasted with pure and divine being.
<p>It is to this end that the renunciation of flesh as food is insisted
on, as in the "Asclepios." Belonging neither by his physical nor his moral
constitution to the order of the carnivora, man can be the best that he
has it in him to be only when his system is cleansed and built up anew
of the pure materials derived from the vegetable kingdom, and indicated
by his structure as his natural diet. The organon of the beatific vision
is the intuition. And not only is the system, when flesh-fed, repressive
of this faculty, but the very failure of the individual to recoil from
violence and slaughter as a means of sustenance or gratification, is an
indication of his lack of this faculty.
<p>In no respect does the Hermetic system shew its unapproachable superiority
to the pseudo-mystical systems than in its equal recognition of the sexes.
True it is that the story of the Fall is of Hermetic origin; but it is
no less true that this is an allegory, having a significance wholly removed
from the literal, and in no way implying blame or inferiority, either to
an individual or to a sex. Representing an eternal verity of divine import,
this allegory has been made the justification for doctrines and practices
in regard to women, which are altogether false, unjust, cruel, and monstrous,
and such as could have proceeded only from elementary and sub-human sources.
<p>In conclusion. All history shews that it is to the restoration of the
Hermetic system in both doctrine and practice that the world must look
for the final solution of the various problems concerning the nature and
conduct of existence, which now --- more than at any previous time ---
exercise the human mind. For it represents that to which all enquiry ---
if only it be free enquiry, unlimited by incapacity, and undistorted by
prejudice --- must ultimately lead; inasmuch as it represents the sure,
because experimental, knowledges, concerning the nature of things which,
in whatever age, the soul of man discloses whenever he has attained full
intuition. Representing the triumph of free-thought--a thought, that is,
which has dared to probe the consciousness in all directions, outwards
and downwards to matter and phenomena, and inwards and upwards to spirit
and reality; it represents also the triumph of religious faith, in that
it sees in God the All and in All of Being; in Nature, the vehicle for
the manifestation of God; and in the Soul --- educated and perfected through
the processes of Nature --- the individualisation of God.

<p><font size=+1>An Introduction to the Virgin of the World.</font></center>

<p><br>
<p>THE mystic title of the celebrated Hermetic fragment with which this
volume commences, "Kor&eacute; Kosmou" that is, the "Kosmic Virgin," is
in itself a revelation of the wonderful identity subsisting between the
ancient wisdom-religion of the old world, and the creed of catholic Christendom.
Kor&eacute; is the name by which, in the Eleusinian Mysteries, Persephone
the Daughter, or Maiden, was saluted; and it is also --- perhaps only by
coincidence --- the Greek word for the pupil or apple of the eye. When,
however, we find Isis, the Moon-goddess and Initiatrix, in her discourse
with Horos, mystically identifying the eye with the soul, and comparing
the tunics of the physical organ of vision with the envelopes of the soul;
when, moreover, we reflect that precisely as the eye, by means of its pupil,
is the enlightener and percipient of the body, so is the soul the illuminating
and seeing principle of man, we can hardly regard this analogy of names
as wholly unintentional and uninstructive. For Kor&eacute;, or Persephone,
the Maiden, is the personified soul, whose "apostasy," or "descent," from
the heavenly sphere into earthly generation, is the theme of the following
Hermetic parable. [1 ]The Greek mysteries dealt only with two subjects,
the first being the drama of the "rape" and restoration of Persephone the
second, that of the incarnation, martyrdom, and resuscitation of Dionysos-Zagreus.
By Persephone was intended the Soul; and by Dionysos, the Spirit. Hermetic
doctrine taught a fourfold nature both of the Kosmos and of Man; and of
this fourfold nature two elements were deemed immortal and permanent, and
two mortal and transient. The former were the spirit and the soul; the
latter, the lower mind --- or sense-body --- and the physical organism.
The spirit and soul, respectively male and female, remained throughout
all the changes of metempsychosis the same, indissoluble and incorrupt,
but the body and lower intellect were new in each rebirth, and therefore
changeful and dissoluble. The spirit, or Dionysos, was regarded as of a
specially divine genesis, being the Son of Zeus by the immaculate Maiden
--- Kor&eacute;-Persephoneia, herself the daughter of Demeter, or the parent
and super-mundane Intelligence, addressed in the Mysteries as the "Mother."
[1] But Kor&eacute;, although thus of heavenly origin, participates more
closely than her Son in an earthly and terrestrial nature. "Hence," says
Proclos, "according to the theologians who delivered to us the most holy
Mysteries, Persephone abides on high in those dwellings of the Mother which
she prepared for her in inaccessible places, exempt from the sensible world.
But
she likewise dwells beneath with Pluto, administering terrestrial concerns,
governing the recesses of the earth, and supplying life to the extremities
of the Kosmos."
<p>Wherefore, considered as the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, Kor&eacute;
is immaculate and celestial in character; considered as the captive and
consort of Hades, she belongs to the lower world and to the region of lamentation
and dissolution. And, indeed, the Soul possesses the dual nature thus ascribed
to her, for she is in her interior and proper quality, incorrupt and inviolable
--- ever virgin --- while in her apparent and relative quality, she is
defiled and fallen. In Hermetic fable the constant emblem of the Soul is
Water, or the Sea --- Maria; and one salient reason for this comparison
is that water, however seemingly contaminated, yet remains, in its essence,
always pure. For the defilement of so-called foul water really consists
in sediments held by it in solution, and thereby causing it to appear turbid,
but this defilement cannot enter into its integral constitution. So that
if the foulest or muddiest water be distilled, it will leave behind in
the cucurbite all its earthy impurities, and present itself, without loss,
clear and lucent in the recipient alembic. Not, therefore, without cause
is the Soul designated "ever virgin," because in her essential self-hood
she is absolutely immaculate and without taint of sin. And the whole history
of the world, from end to end, is the history of the generation, lapse,
sorrows, and final assumption of this Kosmic virgin. For the soul has two
modes or conditions of being --- centrifugal and centripetal. The first
is the condition of her outgoing, her immergence in Matter, or her "fall,"
and the grief and subjection which she thereby brings upon herself. This
phase is, in the Jewish Kabbala, represented by Eve. The second condition
is that of her incoming, her emergence from Matter, her restitution, or
glorification in "heaven." This phase is presented to us in the Christian
evangel and Apocalypse under the name of Mary. Hence the Catholic saying
that the "Ave" of Mary reverses the curse of Eva.
<p>In perfect accord with Kabbalistic doctrine, the allegory of the "Kor&eacute;
Kosmou" thus clearly indicates the nature of the Soul's original apostacy;
"she receded from the prescribed limits; not willing to remain in the same
abode, she moved ceaselessly, and repose seemed death." [1]
<p>In this phrase we have the parallel to the scene represented in the
Mysteries, where Persephone, wilfully straying from the mansions of heaven,
falls under the power of the Hadean God. This, perhaps the most occult
part of the whole allegory, is but lightly touched in the fragmentary discourse
of Isis, and we cannot, therefore, do better than to reproduce here the
eloquent exposition of Thomas Taylor on the subject.
<p>"Here, then," he says, "we see the first cause of the Soul's descent,
namely, the abandoning of a life wholly according to the Higher Intellect,
which is occultly signified by the separation of Proserpina from Ceres.
Afterward, we are told that Jupiter instructs Venus to go to her abode,
and betray Proserpina from her retirement, that Pluto may be enabled to
carry her away; and to prevent any suspicion in the virgin's mind, he commands
Diana and Pallas to go in company. The three Goddesses arriving, find Proserpina
at work on a scarf for her mother; in which she had embroidered the primitive
chaos and the formation of the world. Now, by Venus, in this part of the
narration, we must understand desire, which, even in the celestial regions
(for such is the residence of Proserpina till she is ravished by Pluto),
begins silently and stealthily to creep into the recesses of the Soul.
By Minerva we must conceive the rational power of the Soul, and by Diana,
Nature. And, lastly, the web in which Proserpina had displayed all the
fair variety of the material world, beautifully represents the commencement
of the illusive operations through which the Soul becomes ensnared with
the fascination of imaginative forms. After this, Proserpina, forgetful
of the Mother's commands, is represented as venturing from her retreat
through the treacherous persuasions of Venus. Then we behold her issuing
on to the plain with Minerva and Diana, and attended by a beauteous train
of nymphs, who are evident symbols of the world of generation, and are,
therefore, the proper companions of the Soul about to fall into its fluctuating
realms. Moreover, the design of Proserpina, in venturing from her retreat,
is beautifully significant of her approaching descent; for she rambles
from home for the purpose of gathering flowers, and this in a lawn replete
with the most enchanting variety, and exhaling the most delicious odours.
This is a manifest image of the Soul operating principally according to
the natural and external life, and so becoming ensnared by the delusive
attractions of sensible form. Immediately, Pluto, forcing his passage through
the earth, seizes on Proserpina and carries her away with him. Well may
the Soul, in such a situation, pathetically exclaim with Proserpina:
<p>'O male dilecti flores, despectaque Matris
<br>Consilia; O Veneris deprens&aelig; serius artes!' [1]
<p>Pluto hurries Proserpina into the infernal regions: in other words,
the Soul is sunk into the profound depth and darkness of a material nature.
A description of her marriage next succeeds, her union with the dark tenement
of the body."
<p>To this eloquent exposition of Taylor's, it is well to add the description
given in Homer's Hymn to Ceres. Persephone herself speaks:
<p>"We were plucking the pleasant flowers, the beautiful crocus, the iris,
the hyacinth, and the narcissus, which, like the crocus, the wide earth
produced. With joy I was plucking them, when the earth yawned beneath,
and out leaped the strong King, the Many-Receiver, and went bearing me,
deeply sorrowing, under the earth in his golden chariot, and I cried aloud."
<p>Compare with this Hermetic allegory of the lapse of Persephone and the
manner of it, the Kabbalistic story of the "fall" of Eve.
<p>"And she saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and
delightful to behold; and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat...
And to the woman He said: I will multiply thy sorrows and thy conceptions:
in sorrow shalt thou bring forth, and thou shalt be under thy husband's
power, and he shall have dominion over thee."
<p>In a note appended to Taylor's <i>Dissertations</i>, Dr. Wilder quotes
from Cocker's Greek Philosophy the following excellent reflections:
<p>"The allegory of the Chariot and Winged Steeds, in Plato's Ph&aelig;drus,
represents the lower or inferior part of man's nature (Adam or the body)
as dragging the Soul down to the earth, and subjecting it to the slavery
of corporeal conditions. Out of these conditions arise numerous evils that
disorder the mind and becloud the reason, for evil is inherent to the condition
of finite and multiform existence into which we have fallen. The earthly
life is a fall. The soul is now dwelling in the grave which we call the
body We resemble those captives chained in a subterraneous cave,' so poetically
described in the seventh book of 'The Republic'; their backs turned to
the light, so that they see but the shadows of the objects which pass behind
them, and 'to these shadows they attribute a perfect reality.' Their sojourn
upon earth is thus a dark imprisonment in the body, a dreamy exile from
their proper home."
<p>Similarly we read, in the "Kor&eacute; Kosmou," that the souls on learning
that they were about to be imprisoned in material bodies, sighed and lamented,
lilting to heaven glances of sorrow, and crying piteously, "O woe and heartrending
grief to quit these vast splendors, this sacred sphere, and all the glories
of the blessed republic of the Gods to be precipitated into these vile
and miserable abodes! No longer shall we behold the divine and luminous
heavens!"
<p>Who, in reading this, is not reminded of the pathetic lament of Eve
on quitting the fair "ambrosial bowers" of Paradise? [1]
<p>From the sad and woful state into which the Virgin thus falls, she is
finally rescued and restored to the supernal abodes. But not until the
coming of the Saviour, represented in the allegory before us under the
name of Osiris --- the Man Regenerate. This Redeemer, himself of divine
origin, is in other allegories represented under other names, but the idea
is always luminously defined, and the intention obvious. Osiris is the
Iesous of our Christian doctrine, the supreme Initiate or "Captain of Salvation."
He is represented, together with his Spouse, as in all things "instructed"
and directed by HERMES, famed as the celestial conductor of souls from
the "dark abodes;" the wise and ubiquitous God in whom the initiate recognises
the Genius of the Understanding or Divine Reason--the nous of Platonic
doctrine, and the mystic "Spirit of Christ." Therefore, as the understanding
of holy things and the faculty of their interpretation are the gift of
HERMES, the name of this God is given to all science and revelation of
an occult and divine nature. A "Divine" is, in fact, one who knows the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; hence S. John the seer, or the "divine,"
is especially the "beloved" of Christ. HERMES was regarded as the Messenger
or Angel of the Gods, descending alike to the depths of the Hadean world,
to bring up souls from thence, and ascending up beyond all heavens that
he might fill all things. For the Understanding must search alike the deeps
and the heights; there can be nothing hidden from it, nor can it attain
the fulness of supernal and secret knowledge unless it first explore the
phenomenal and terrestrial. "For that he ascended, what is it but because
he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
<p>With the splendid joyousness and light-hearted humour which characterised
the Greeks, mingling laughter and mirth even with the mysteries of Religion,
and making their sacred allegories human and musical as no others of any
nation or time, HERMES, the Diviner and Revealer, was also playfully styled
a Thief, and the patron of thieves. But thereby was secretly indicated
the power and skill of the Understanding in making everything intellectually
its own. Wherefore, in charging HERMES with filching the girdle of Venus,
the tongs of Vulcan, and the thunder of Jove, as well as with stealing
and driving off the cattle of Apollo, it was signified that all good and
noble gifts, even the attributes of the high Gods themselves, are accessible
to the Understanding, and that nothing is withheld from man's intelligence,
if only man have the skill to seek aright.
<p>As the immediate companion of the sun, HERMES is the opener of the gates
of the highest heaven, the revealer of spiritual light and life, the Mediator
between the inner and outer spheres of existence, and the Initiator into
those sacred mysteries, the knowledge of which is life eternal.
<p>The panoply with which Greek art invests HERMES, is symbolical of the
functions of the Understanding. He has four implements--the rod, the wings,
the sword, and the cap, denoting respectively the science of the magian,
the courage of the adventurer, the will of the hero, and the discretion
of the adept. The initiates of HERMES acknowledge no authority but the
Understanding; they call no man king or master upon earth; they are true
Free-Thinkers and Republicans. "For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty." [1] Hence Lactantius, in his "Divine Institutions," says:---
"Hermes affirms that those who know God are safe from the attacks of the
demon, and that they, are not even subjected to Fate." Now, the powers
of Fate reside in the stars --- that is, in the astral sphere, whether
Kosmic or micro-Kosmic. And the astral power was, in Greek fable, typified
by Argos, the hundred-eyed genius of the starry zone, Panoptes, the all-seeing
giant, whom it was the glory of HERMES to have outwitted and slain. Of
which allegory the meaning is, that they who have the Hermetic secret are
not subject to Fate, but have passed beyond the thrall of metempsychosis,
and have freed themselves from "ceaseless whirling on the wheel" of Destiny.
To know God is to have overcome death, and the power of death. To know
the origin and secret of delusion is to transcend delusion. The spheres
of delusion, dominated by the sevenfold astral Powers, lie between the
Soul and God. Beyond these spheres are the celestial "Nine Abodes," wherein,
say the Mysteries, Demeter vainly sought the lost Persephone. For from
these abodes she had lapsed into a mundane and material state, and thereby
had fallen under the power of the planetary rulers; that is, of Fate, personified
by Hekate. On the tenth day, therefore, the divine Drama shows Demeter
meeting the Goddess of Doom and Retribution, the terrible Hekate Triformis
--- personification of Karma --- by whom the "Mother" is told of Persephone's
abduction and detention in the Hadean world. And --- we learn --- Hekate
becomes thereafter the constant attendant of Persephone. All this is, of
course, pregnant with the deepest significance. Until the Soul falls into
Matter, she has no Fate, or Karma. Fate is the appanage and result of Time
and of Manifestation. In the sevenfold astral spheres the Moon is representative
of Fate, and presents two aspects, the benign and the malignant. Under
the benign aspect the Moon is Artemis, reflecting to the Soul the divine
light of Phœbos; under the malignant aspect she is Hekate the Avenger,
dark of countenance; and three beaded, being swift as a horse, sure as
a dog, and as a lion implacable. She it is who, fleet, sagacious, and pitiless,
hunts guilty souls from birth to birth, and outwits death itself with unerring
justice. To the innocent and chaste soul, therefore, the lunar power is
favorable. Artemis is the patron and protectress of virgins --- that is,
of souls undefiled with the traffic of Matter. In this aspect the Moon
is the Initiatrix, Isis the Enlightener, because through a beneficent Karma,
or fate, the soul receives interior illumination, and the dark recesses
of her chamber are lit up by sacred reminiscences. Hence, in subsequent
births, such a soul becomes prophetic and "divine." But to the corrupt
and the evil-hearted the influence of the Moon is malignant, for to such
she assumes the aspect of Hekate, smiting by night, and terrifying with
ghostly omens of misfortune. These souls fear the lunar power, and in this
instinctive dread may be discerned their secret recognition of the evil
fate which they are preparing for themselves in existences to come. The
Tree of Good and Evil, says the Kabbala, has its root in Malchuth --- the
Moon.
<p>It has been sometime asserted that the doctrine of Karma is peculiar
to Hindu theology. On the contrary, it is clearly exhibited alike in the
Hebrew, Hellenic, and Christian Mysteries. The Greeks called it Fate; the
Christians know it as Original Sin. With which sin all mortal men come
into the world, and on account of which all pass under condemnation. Only
the "Mother of God" is exempt from it, the "virgin immaculate," through
whose Seed the world shall be redeemed.
<p>"As the lily among the thorns," sings the Church in the "Office of the
Immaculate Conception," "so is the Beloved among the Daughters of Adam.
Thou art all fair, O Beloved, and the original stain is not in thee: Thy
name, O Mary, is as oil poured out; therefore, the virgins love thee exceedingly."
<p>If, then, by Persephone or Kor&eacute;, the "Virgin of the World," we
are thus plainly taught to understand the Soul, we are no less plainly
taught to see in Isis, the Initiatrix or Enlightener. Herself, equally
with Kor&eacute;, virgin and mother, the Egyptian Isis is, in her philosophical
aspect, identical with the Ephesian Artemis, the Greek personification
of the fructifying and all-nourishing power of Nature. She was regarded
as the "inviolable and perpetual Maid of heaven;" her priests were eunuchs,
and her image in the magnificent temple of Ephesus represented her with
many breasts --- [Greek]. [1] In works of art Artemis appears variously,
as the huntress, accompanied by hounds, and carrying the implements of
the chase; as the Goddess of the Moon, covered with a long veil reaching
to her feet, and her head adorned with a crescent; or as the many-breasted
Mother-Maid, holding a lighted torch in her hand. The Latins worshipped
her under the name of Diana, and it is as Diana that the Ephesian Artemis
is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. Isis had all the attributes ascribed
to the lunar divinity of the Greeks and Romans; and hence, like Artemis
and Diana, she was identified with the occult principle of Nature --- that
is, Fate, which in its various aspects and relations was severally viewed
as Fortune, Retribution, Doom, or Destiny; a principle represented, as
we have already seen, by the Kabbalists, under the figure of Malchuth,
or the Moon; and by the Hindu theosophists under the more abstract conception
of Karma. The hounds of Artemis, or Diana, are the occult powers which
hunt down and pursue the soul from birth to birth; the inevitable, implacable
forces of Nature which, following evermore on the steps of every ego, compel
it into the conditions successively engendered by its actions, as effect
by cause. Hence Act&aelig;on, presuming upon Fate, and oblivious of the
sanctity and inviolability of this unchanging law of Karmic Destiny, is
torn in pieces by his own dogs, to wit, his own deeds, which by the decree
of the implacable Goddess, turn upon and rend him. So also, in accordance
with this philosophical idea, those who were initiated into the mysteries
of Isis, wore in the public processions masks representing the heads of
dogs. So intimately was the abstract conception of the moon associated
by the ancients with that of the secret influence and power of Destiny
in Nature, that Proclos in his <i>Commentary upon the Tim&aelig;us</i>
says of Diana: --- "She presides over the whole of the generation into
natural existence, leads forth into light all natural reasons, and extends
a prolific power from on high even to the subterranean realms." These words
completely describe the Egyptian Isis, and show us how the moon, occultly
viewed as the Karmic power, was regarded as the cause of continued generation
in natural conditions, pursuing souls even into the Hadean or purgatorial
spheres and visiting upon them the fruition of their past. Hence, too,
in the Orphic Hymn to Nature, that Goddess is identified with Fortune,
and represented as standing with her feet upon a wheel which she continually
turns,--"moving with rapid motion on an eternal wheel." [1] And again,
in another Orphic Hymn, Fortune herself is invoked as Diana. Proclos, in
the Commentary to which reference has already been made, declares that
"the moon is the cause of Nature to mortals, and the self-revealing image
of the Fountain of Nature". "If," says Thomas Taylor, "the reader is desirous
of knowing what we are to understand by the fountain of Nature of which
the moon is the image, let him attend to the following information, derived
from a long and deep study of the ancient theology, for from hence I have
learned that there are many divine fountains contained in the essence of
the Demiurgus of the world; and that among these there are three of a very
distinguished rank, namely, the fountain of souls, or Juno (Hera), the
fountain of virtues, or Minerva (Athena), and the fountain of nature, or
Diana (Artemis)... And this information will enable us to explain the meaning
of the following passages in Apuleius, the first of which is in the beginning
of the eleventh book of his Metamorphoses, wherein the divinity of the
moon is represented as addressing him in this sublime manner: --- 'Behold,
Lucius, moved with thy supplications, I am present; I, who am Nature, the
parent of things, mistress of all the elements, initial progeny of the
ages, the highest of the divinities, queen of departed spirits, the first
of the celestials, of Gods and Goddesses the sole likeness of all; who
rule by my nod the luminous heights of the heavens, the salubrious breezes
of the sea, and the woful silences of the infernal regions, and whose divinity,
in itself but one, is venerated by all the earth, in many characters, various
rites, and different appellations.. Those who are enlightened by the emerging
rays of the rising sun, the &AElig;thiopians and Aryans, and likewise the
Egyptians, powerful in ancient learning, who reverence my divinity with
ceremonies perfectly appropriate, call me by my true appellation Queen
Isis.' And again, in another place of the same book, he says of the moon:
--- The supernal Gods reverence thee, and those in the realms beneath do
homage to thy divinity. Thou dost make the world to revolve, and the sun
to illumine, thou rulest the universe and treadest on Tartarus. To thee
the stars respond, the deities rejoice, time returns by thee, the elements
give thee service.' For all this easily follows if we consider it as spoken
of the fountain-deity of Nature subsisting in the Demiurgus, and which
is the exemplar of that nature which flourishes in the lunar orb and throughout
the material world."
<p>Thus enlightened as to the office and functions of Isis, we are at no
loss to understand why she is selected by the writer of the following Hermetic
fragment as the exponent of the origin, history, and destiny of the soul.
For she is, in a peculiar sense, the arbiter of the soul's career in existence,
her guardian and overseer. If Demeter, the Divine Intelligence, be the
Mother of Kor&eacute;, then Isis is her foster-mother, for no sooner does
the soul fall into generation than Isis becomes her directress and the
dispenser of her fate. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that by
some mythologists Isis is identified with Demeter, and the sufferings of
the former modified accordingly, to harmonise with the allegory of the
sorrows of Demeter as set forth in the Eleusinian Mysteries. But the cause
of this confusion is obvious to those who rightly understand the Hermetic
method. Isis, whether as Artemis (Good Fortune), or as Hekate (Evil Fortune),
is the controlling and illuminating influence of the soul while remaining
within the jurisdiction of Nature and Time; Demeter, the Divine Intelligence,
represents the heavenly fountain or super-mundane source, whence the soul
originally draws her being, and as such, is concerned directly, not with
her exile and wanderings in material conditions, but with her final recovery
from generation and return to the celestial abodes. Consistently with this
idea, Isis is represented sometimes as the spouse, sometimes as the mother
of Osiris, the Saviour of men. For Osiris is the microcosmic sun, the counterpart
in the human system of the macrocosmic Dionysos or Son of God. So that
those authors who confound Isis with Demeter, equally and quite comprehensibly
confound Osiris with Dionysos, and regard the former as the central figure
of the Bacchic Mysteries. The Hermetic books admit three expressions of
Deity: first, the supreme, abstract, and infinite God, eternally self-subsistent
and unmanifest; secondly, the only-Begotten, the manifestation of Deity
in the universe; thirdly, God in man, the Redeemer, or Osiris. On one of
the walls of the Temple of the Sun at Philae, and on the gate of that at
Medinet-Abou are inscribed these words: --- "He has made all that is, and
without Him nothing that is hath been made," words which, fourteen centuries
or more afterwards, were applied by the writer of S. John's Gospel to the
Word of God. The microcosmic Sun, or Osiris, was the image and correspondence
of this macrocosmic Sun; the regenerating principle within the man, begotten
by means of the soul's experience in Time and Generation. And hence the
intimate association between this regenerating principle by which the redemption
of the individual was effected, and the divine power in Nature, personified
by Isis, whose function it was to minister to that redemption by the ordination
of events and conditions appropriate to the soul's development. Isis is
thus the secret motive-power of Evolution; Osiris is the ultimate ideal
Humanity towards the realisation of which that Evolution moves.

character and destiny, and the full knowledge of it redeems from Karma
the personality informed of it. Atman is also the all-seeing; and, as the

<p>HAVING thus spoken, Isis first pours out for Horos the sweet draught
of immortality which souls receive from the Gods, and thus begins the most
holy discourse. Heaven, crowned with stars, is placed above universal nature,
O my son Horos, and nothing is wanting to it of that which constitutes
the whole world. It is necessary, then, that all nature should be adorned
and completed by that which is above her, for this Order could not proceed
from below to above. The supremacy of the greater mysteries over the lesser
is imperative. Celestial order reigns over terrestrial order, as being
absolutely determined, and inaccessible to the idea of death. Wherefore,
the things below lament, being filled with fear before the marvellous beauty
and eternal permanence of the heavenly world. For, indeed, a spectacle
worthy of contemplation and desire were these magnificences of heaven,
revelations of the God as yet unknown, and this sumptuous majesty of night
illumined with a penetrating radiance, albeit less than that of the sun,
and all these other mysteries which move above in harmonious cadence, ruling
and maintaining the things below by secret influences. And so long as the
Universal Architect refrained from putting an end to this incessant fear,
to these anxious investigations, ignorance enveloped the universe. But
when He judged good to reveal Himself to the world, He breathed into the
Gods the enthusiasm of love, and poured into their mind the splendour which
His bosom contained, that they might first be inspired with the will to
seek, next with the desire to find, and lastly with the power to readjust.
<p>Now, my wondrous child Horos, all this could not happen among mortals,
for as yet they did not exist; but it took place in the universal Soul
in sympathy with the mysteries of heaven. This was Hermes, the Kosmic Thought.
He beheld the universe of things, and having seen, he understood, and having
understood, he had the power to manifest and to reveal. That which he thought,
he wrote; that which he wrote, he in great part concealed, wisely silent.
and speaking by turns, so that while the world should last, these things
might be sought. And thus, having enjoined upon the Gods, his brethren,
that they should follow in his train, he ascended to the stars. But he
had for successor his son, and the heir of his knowledges, Tat, and a little
later, Asclepios, son of Imouth&egrave;, by the counsels of Pan and Hephaistos,
[1] and all those for whom sovereign Providence reserved an exact knowledge
of heavenly things.
<p>Hermes then justified himself in the presence of those who surrounded
him, in that he had not delivered the integral theory to his son, on account
of his youth. But I, having arisen, beheld with mine eyes, which see the
invisible secrets of the beginnings of things, [2] and at length, but with
certainty, I understood that the sacred symbols of the Kosmic elements
were hidden near the secrets of Osiris. Hermes returned to heaven, having
pronounced an invocatory speech.
<p>It is not fitting, O my Son, that this recital be left incomplete; thou
must be informed of the words of Hermes when he laid down his books. "O
sacred books," he said, "of the Immortals, ye in whose pages my hand has
recorded the remedies by which incorruptibility is conferred, remain for
ever beyond the reach of destruction and of decay, invisible and concealed
from all who frequent these regions, until the day shall come in which
the ancient heaven shall bring forth instruments worthy of you, whom the
Creator shall call souls."
<p>Having pronounced upon his books this invocation, he wrapped them in
their coverings, returned into the sphere which belonged to him, and all
remained hidden for a sufficient space.
<p>And Nature, O my Son, was barren until the hour in which those who are
ordained to survey the heavens, advancing towards God, the King of all
things, deplored the general inertia, and affirmed the necessity of setting
forth the universe. No other than Himself could accomplish this work.
<p>"We pray Thee," said they, "to consider that which already is, and that
which is necessary for the future."
<p>At these words, the God smiled benignant, and commanded Nature to exist.
And, issuing with His voice, the FEMININE came forth in her perfect beauty.
The Gods with amaze beheld this marvel. And the great Ancestor, pouring
out for Nature an elixir, commanded her to be fruitful; and forthwith,
penetrating the universe with His glance, He cried, "Let heaven be the
plenitude of all things, and of the air, and of the ether." God spake,
and it was done. But Nature, communing with herself, understood that she
might not transgress the commandment of the Father, and, uniting herself
to Labour, she produced a most beautiful daughter, whom she called Invention,
and to whom God accorded being.
<p>And having differentiated created forms, He filled them with mysteries,
and gave the command of them to Invention.
<p>Then, not willing that the upper world should be inactive, He saw fit
to fill it with spirits, in order that no region should remain in immobility
and inertia; and in the accomplishment of His work He used His sacred art.
For, taking of Himself such essence as was necessary, and mingling with
it an intellectual flame, He combined with these other materials by unknown
ways. And having achieved by secret formulas the union of these principles,
He endowed with motion the universal combination. Gradually, in the midst
of the protoplasm, glittered a substance more subtle, purer, more limpid,
than the elements from which it was generated. It was transparent, and
the Artist alone perceived it. Soon, it attained its perfection, being
neither melted by the fire, nor chilled by the breath, but possessing the
stability of a special combination, and having its proper type and constitution.
He bestowed on it a happy name, and, according to the similitude of its
energies, He called it Self-Consciousness.
<p>Of this product he formed myriads of Souls, employing the choicest part
of the mixture for the end which He had in view, proceeding with order
and measure, according to His knowledge and His reason. The souls were
not necessarily different, but the choicest part, animated by the Divine
motion, was not identical with the rest. The first layer was superior to
the second, more perfect and pure; the second, inferior truly to the first,
was superior to the third; and thus, until sixty degrees, was completed
the total number. Only, God established this law, that all equally should
be eternal, being of one essence, whose forms He alone determines. He traced
the limits of their sojourn on the heights of nature, so that they might
turn the wheel according to the laws of Order and of wise discretion, for
the joy of their Father.
<p>Then, having summoned to these splendid regions of ether the souls of
every grade, He said to them: "O souls, beautiful children of my breath
and of my care, you whom I have produced with my hands, in order to consecrate
you to my universe, hear my words as a law: --- Quit not the place assigned
to you by my will. The abode which awaits you is heaven, with its galaxy
of stars and its thrones of virtue. If you attempt any transgression against
my decree, I swear by my sacred breath, by that elixir of which I formed
you, and by my creative hands, that I will speedily forge for you chains
and cast you into punishment."
<p>Having thus spoken, God, my Master, mingled together the rest of the
congenial elements, earth and water, and pronouncing certain powerful and
mystic words --- albeit different from the first --- He breathed into the
liquid protoplasm motion and life, rendered it thicker and more plastic,
and formed of it living beings of human shape. That which remained He gave
to the loftiest souls inhabiting the region of the Gods in the neighbourhood
of the stars, who are called the Sacred Genii. "Work," said He, "my children,
offspring of my nature; take the residue of my task, and let each one of
you make beings in his image. I will give you models."
<p>Therewith He took the Zodiac and ordained the world in conformity with
-vital movements, placing the animal signs after those of human form. And
after having given forth the creative forces and generative breath for
the whole range of beings yet to come, He withdrew, promising to unite
to every visible work an invisible breath and a reproductive principle,
so that each being might engender its similar without necessity to create
continually new entities. [1]
<p>And what did the souls do, O my Mother?
<p>And Isis answered: --- They took the mingled material, O my Son Horos,
and began to reflect thereon, and to adore this combination, the work of
the Father. Next, they sought to discover of what it was composed, which,
indeed, it was not easy to find. Then, fearing that this search might excite
the anger of the Father, they set themselves to carry out His commands.
Therefore, taking the upper portion of the protoplasm, that which was lightest,
they created of it the race of birds. The compound having now become more
compact and assuming a denser consistency, they formed of it the quadrupeds;
while of the thickest part which needed a moist vehicle for its support,
they made fishes. The remainder, being cold and heavy, was employed by
the souls in the creation of reptiles.
<p>Forthwith, O my Son, proud of their work, they were not afraid to transgress
the Divine law, and, in spite of the prohibition, they receded from their
appointed limits. Not willing to remain longer in the same abode, they
moved ceaselessly, and repose seemed to them death. [1]
<p>But, O my Son --- (thus Hermes informed me) --- their conduct could
not escape the eye of the Lord God of all things; He minded to punish them,
and to prepare for them hard bonds. The Ruler and Master of the universe
resolved then for the penance of the souls, to mould the human organism,
and having called me to Him, said Hermes, He spoke in this wise:--"O soul
of my soul, holy thought of my thought, how long shall earthly Nature remain
sad? How long shall the creation already produced continue inactive and
without praise? Bring hither before me all the Gods of heaven."
<p>Thus God spake, quoth Hermes, and all obeyed His decree. "Look upon
the earth," He said to them, "and upon all things beneath,"
<p>Straightway they looked, and understood the will of the Lord. And when
He spoke to them of the creation of Man, asking of each what he could bestow
upon the race about to be born, the Sun first replied:--- "I will illumine
mankind." Then the Moon promised enlightenment in her turn, adding that
already she had created Fear, Silence, Sleep, and Memory. Kronos announced
that he had begotten Justice and Necessity. Zeus said, "In order to spare
the future race perpetual wars, I have generated Fortune, Hope, and Peace."
Ares declared himself already father of Conflict, impetuous Zeal, and Emulation,
Aphrodite did not wait to be called upon: "As for me, O Master," she said,
"I will bestow upon mankind Desire, with voluptuous Joy and Laughter, that
the penalty, to which our sister Souls are destined may not weigh on them
too hardly." These words of Aphrodite, O my Son, were welcomed gladly.
"And I," said Hermes, "will endow human nature with Wisdom, Temperance,
Persuasion, and Truth; nor will I cease to ally myself with Invention.
I will ever protect the mortal life of such men as are born under my signs,
seeing that to me the Creator and Father has attributed in the Zodiac,
signs of Knowledge and Intelligence; above all, when the movement which
draws thereto the stars is in harmony with the physical forces of each."
[1]
<p>He Who is Master of the world rejoiced at hearing these things, and
decreed the production of the human race. As for me --- said Hermes ---
I sought what material ought to be employed in the work, and invoked the
Lord. He commanded the Souls to give up the residue of the protoplastic
substance, which having taken, I found it entirely dried up. Therefore,
I used a great excess of water wherewith to renew the combination of the
substance, in such wise that the product might be resolvable, yielding,
and feeble, and that Force should not be added therein to Intelligence.
When I had achieved my work it was beautiful, and I rejoiced in seeing
it. And from below I called upon the Lord to behold what I had done. He
saw it, and approved. Straightway He ordained that the Souls should be
incorporated; and they were seized with horror on learning what should
be their condemnation.
<p>These words, said Isis, struck me. Hearken, my son Horos, for I teach
thee a mystery. Our ancestor Kamephes had it also from Hermes, who inscribes
the recital of all things; I, in turn, received it from the ancient Kamephes
when he admitted me to the initiation of the black veil; [2] and thou,
likewise, O marvellous and illustrious child, receive it from me.
<p>The Souls were about to be imprisoned in bodies, whereat some sighed
and lamented, as when some wild and free animal suddenly enchained, in
the first moment of subjection to hard servitude and of severance from
the beloved habits of the wilderness, struggles and revolts, refusing to
follow its conqueror, and if occasion presents itself, slaying him. Others,
again, hissed like serpents, or gave vent to piercing cries and sorrowful
words, glancing aimlessly from height to depth.
<p>"Great Heaven," said one, "principle of our birth, ether, pure airs,
hands, and sacred breath of the sovereign God, and you, shining Stars,
eyes of the Gods, unwearying light of Sun and Moon, our early brethren,
what grief, what rending is this! Must we quit these vast, effulgent spaces,
this sacred sphere, all these splendors of the empyrean and of the happy
republic of the Gods, to be precipitated into these vile and miserable
abodes? What crime, O wretched ones, have we committed? How can we have
merited, poor sinners that we are, the penalties which await us? Behold
the sad future in store for us--to minister to the wants of a fluctuating
and dissoluble body! No more may our eyes distinguish the souls divine!
Hardly through these watery spheres shall we perceive, with sighs, our
ancestral heaven; at intervals even we shall cease altogether to behold
it. By this disastrous sentence direct vision is denied to us; we can see
only by the aid of the outer light; these are but windows that we possess--not
eyes. Nor will our pain be less when we hear in the air the fraternal breathing
of the winds with which no longer can we mingle our own, since that will
have for its dwelling, instead of the sublime and open world, the narrow
prison of the breast! But Thou, Who drivest us forth, and causest us from
so high a seat to descend so low, assign a limit to our sufferings! O Master
and Father, so quickly become indifferent to Thy handiwork, appoint a term
to our penance, deign to bestow on us some last words, while yet we are
able to behold the expanse of the luminous spheres!"
<p>This prayer of the Souls was granted, my son Horos, for the Lord was
present; and sitting upon the throne of Truth, thus He addressed them:---
<p>"O Souls; you shall be governed by Desire and Necessity; after me, these
shall be your masters and your guides. Souls, subjected to my sceptre which
never fails, know that inasmuch as you remain stainless you shall inhabit
the regions of the skies. If among you any be found to merit reproach,
they shall inhabit abodes destined to them in mortal organisms. If your
faults be light, you shall, delivered from the bond of the flesh, return
to heaven. But if you become guilty of graver crime, if you turn away from
the end for which you have been formed, then indeed you shall dwell neither
in heaven nor in human bodies, but thenceforth you shall pass into those
of animals without reason." [1]
<p>Having thus spoken, O my son Horos, He breathed upon them and said,
"It is not according to chance that I have ordained your destiny; if you
act ill, it will be worse; it will be better if your actions are worthy
of your birth. It is myself and not another who will be your witness and
your judge. Understand that it is because of your past errors that you
are to be punished and shut up in fleshly bodies. In different bodies,
as I have already told you, your re-births will be different. Dissolution
shall be a benefit, restoring your former happy condition. But if your
conduct be unworthy of me, your prudence, becoming blinded and guiding
you backwards, will cause you to take for good fortune that which is really
a chastisement, and to dread a happier lot as though it were a cruel injury.
The most just among you shall, in their future transformations, approximate
to the divine, becoming among men, upright kings, true philosophers, leaders
and legislators, true seers, collectors of salutary plants, cunning musicians,
intelligent astronomers, wise augurs, instructed ministrants: all beautiful
and good offices; as among birds are the eagles which pursue not nor devour
those of their own kind, and do not permit weaker ones to be attacked in
their presence, because justice is in the nature of the eagle; among quadrupeds,
the lion, for he is a strong animal, untamed by slumber, in a mortal body
performing immortal toils, and by nothing tired nor beguiled; among reptiles,
the dragon, because he is powerful, living long, innocent, and a friend
of men, allowing himself to be tamed, having no venom, and, leaving old
age, approximating to the nature of the Gods; among fishes, the dolphin,
for this creature, taking pity on those who fall into the sea, will carry
them to land if they still live, and will abstain from devouring them if
dead, although it is the most voracious of all aquatic animals."
<p>Having spoken these words, God became an Incorruptible Intelligence
(i.e., resumed the unmanifest).
<p>After these things, my son Horos, there arose out of the earth an exceeding
powerful Spirit, unencumbered with any corporeal envelope, strong in wisdom,
but savage and fearful; although he could not be ignorant of the knowledge
he sought, seeing the type of the human body to be beautiful and august
of aspect, and perceiving that the souls were about to enter into their
envelopes:
<p>"What are these," said he, "O Hermes, Secretary of the Gods?" "These
are men," replied Hermes. "It is a rash work," said he, "to make man with
such penetrating eyes, such a subtle tongue, such a delicate hearing that
can hear even those things which concern him not, such a fine scent, and
in. his hands a sense of touch capable of appropriating everything. O generating
Spirit, thinkest thou it is well that he should be free from care--this
future investigator of the fine mysteries of Nature? Wilt thou leave him
exempt from suffering --- he whose thought will search out the limits of
the earth? Mankind will dig up the roots of plants, they will study the
properties of natural juices, they will observe the nature of stones, they
will dissect not only animals but themselves, desiring to know how they
have been formed. They will stretch forth their daring hands over the sea,
and, cutting down the timber of the wild forest, they will pass from shore
to shore seeking one another. They will pursue the inmost secrets of Nature
even into the heights, and will study the motions of heaven. Nor is this
enough; when nothing yet remains to be known than the furthest boundary
of the earth, they will seek even there the last extremities of night.
If they apprehend no obstacle, if they live exempt from trouble, beyond
reach of any fear or of any anxiety, even heaven itself will not arrest
their audacity; they will seek to extend their power over the elements.
Teach them, then, desire and hope, in such wise that they may know likewise
the dread of accident and of difficulty, and the painful sting of expectation
deceived. Let the curiosity of their souls have for balance, desire and
fear, care and vain hope. Let their souls be a prey to mutual love, to
aspirations and varied longings, now satisfied, now deceived, so that even
the sweetness of success may be an allurement to draw them towards misfortune.
Let the weight of fevers oppress them, and break in them all desire."
<p>Thou sufferest, Horos, in hearing this thy mother's recital? Surprise
and wonder seize thee in presence of the evils which now fall upon poor
humanity? That which thou art about to hear is still more sad. The speech
of Momos pleased Hermes; he deemed his advice good, and he followed it.
<p>"O, Momos," said he, "the nature of the divine breath which enwraps
all things shall not be ineffectual! The Master of the universe has charged
me to be His agent and overseer. The Deity of the penetrating eye (Adrastia)
1 will observe and direct all events; and for my part, I will design a
mysterious instrument, a measure inflexible and inviolable, to which everything
shall be subject from birth even to final destruction, and which shall
be the bond of created entities. This instrument shall rule that which
is on the earth, and all the rest."
<p>It is thus--quoth Hermes--that I spoke to Momos; and forthwith the instrument
operated. Straightway the souls were incorporated, and I was praised for
my work.
<p>Then the Lord summoned anew the assembly of the Gods. They gathered
together, and He thus addressed them:
<p>"Gods, who have received a sovereign and imperishable nature, and the
sway of the vast eternity, ye whose office it is to maintain unceasingly
the mutual harmony of things, how long shall we govern an empire unknown?
How long shall creation remain invisible to the sun and moon? Let each
of us undertake his part in the universe. By the exercise of our power
let us put an end to the cohesion of inertia. Let chaos become a fable,
incredible to posterity. Inaugurate your great labours; I will direct you."
<p>He said, and immediately the Kosmic unity, until now obscure, was opened,
and in the heights appeared the heavens with all their mysteries. The earth,
hitherto unstable, grew more solid beneath the brightness of the sun, and
stood forth adorned with enfolding riches. All things are beautiful in
the eyes of God, even that which to mortals appears uncomely, because all
is made according to the divine laws. And God rejoiced in beholding His
works filled with movement; and with outstretched hands grasping the treasures
of nature. "Take these," He said, "O sacred earth, take these, O venerable
one, who art to be the mother of all things, and henceforth let nothing
be lacking to thee!"
<p>With these words, opening His divine hands, He poured His treasures
into the universal font. But yet they were unknown, for the souls newly
embodied and unable to support their opprobrium, sought to enter into rivalry
with the celestial Gods, and, proud of their lofty origin, boasting an
equal creation with these, revolted. Thus men became their instruments,
opposed to one another, and fomenting civil wars. And thus, force oppressing
weakness, the strong burnt and massacred the feeble, and quick and dead
were thrust forth from the sacred places.
<p>Then the elements resolved to complain before the Lord of the savage
condition of mankind. For the evil being already very grievous, the elements
hastened to God the Creator, and pleaded in this wise --- the fire being
suffered to speak first:--- [1]
<p>"O Master," he said, "Maker of this new world, Thou whose name, mysterious
among the Gods, has hitherto been revered among all men; how long, O Divinity,
halt Thou decreed to leave human life without God? Reveal Thyself to the
world which calls for Thee, correct its savage existence by the institution
of peace. Grant unto life, law, grant unto night oracles; fill all things
with happy auguries; let men fear the judgment of the Gods, and no man
shall sin any more. Let crimes receive their just punishment, and men will
abstain from unrighteousness. They will fear to violate oaths, and madness
will have an end. Teach them gratitude for benefits, so shall I devote
my flame to pure offerings and libations, and the altars shall yield Thee
exhalations of sweet savours. For now I am polluted, O Master, because
the impious temerity of men forces me to consume flesh. They will not suffer
me to remain in my nature; they pervert and corrupt my purity!"
<p>The air spoke in its turn: --- "I am defiled by the effluvium of corpses,
O Master; I am becoming pestilent and unwholesome, and from on high I witness
things which I ought not to behold."
<p>Then the water took up the word, and spoke on this wise, O my illustrious
son: ---
<p>"Father and wondrous Creator of all things, Divinity incarnate, Author
of Nature who brings forth all through Thee, command the waters of the
streams to be always pure, for now both rivers and seas are compelled to
bathe the destroyer and to receive his victims!"
<p>Then at the last the earth appeared, O my glorious son, and thus began:
---
<p>"O King, Chief of celestial choirs and Lord of their orbits, Master
and Father of the elements which lend to all things increase and decrease,
and into which all must return; behold how the impious and insensate tribe
of man overspreads me, O venerable One, since by Thy commands I am the
habitation of all beings, bearing them all and receiving into my bosom
all that is slain; such is now my reproach. Thy terrestrial world in which
all creatures are contained is bereft of God. And because they revere nothing,
they transgress every law and overwhelm me with all manner of evil works.
To my shame, O Lord, I admit into myself the product of the corruption
of carcases. But I, who receive all things, would fain also receive God.
Grant to earth this grace, and if Thou comest not Thyself --- for indeed
I cannot contain Thee --- let me at least receive some holy efflux of Thee.
Let the earth become the most glorious of all the elements; and since she
alone gives all things to all, may she revere herself as the recipient
of Thy favours."
<p>Thus the elements discoursed, and forthwith God filled the universe
with His divine voice. "Go," said He, "sacred offspring, worthy of your
Father's greatness, seek not to change anything, nor refuse to my creatures
your ministry. I will send you an efflux of myself, a pure Being who shall
investigate all actions, who shall be the dreadful and incorruptible Judge
of the living; and sovereign justice shall extend its reign even into the
shades beneath the earth. Thus shall every man receive his merited deserts."
<p>Thereupon the elements ceased from their complaints, and each of them
resumed its functions and its sway.
<p>And in what manner, O my mother, said Horos, did the earth afterwards
obtain this efflux of God?
<p>I will not recount this Nativity, said Isis; I dare not, O powerful
Horos, declare the origin of thy race, lest men in the future should learn
the generation of the Gods. I will say only that the Supreme God, Creator
and Architect of the world, at length accorded to earth for a season, thy
father Osiris and the great Goddess Isis, that they might bring the expected
salvation. By them life attained its fulness; savage and bloody wars were
ended; they consecrated temples to the Gods their ancestors, and instituted
oblations. They gave to mortals law, nourishment, and raiment. "They shall
read," Hermes said, "my mystic writings, and dividing them into two parts,
they shall keep certain of them, and inscribe upon columns and obelisks
those which may be useful to man." Institutors of the first tribunals,
they established everywhere the reign of order and justice. With them began
the faith of treaties, and the introduction into human life of the religious
duty of oaths. They taught the rites of sepulture towards those who cease
to live; they interrogated the horrors of death; they shewed that the spirit
from without delights to return into the human body, and that if the way
of entry be shut against it, it brings about a failure of life. Instructed
by Hermes, they engraved upon hidden tables that the air is filled with
genii. Instructed by Hermes in the secret laws of God, they alone were
the teachers and legislators of mankind, initiating them in the arts, the
sciences, and the benefits of civilised life. Instructed by Hermes concerning
the sympathetic affinities which the Creator has established between heaven
and earth, they instituted religious representations and sacred mysteries.
And, considering the corruptible nature of all bodies, they ordained prophetic
initiation, so that the prophet who lifts his hands to the Gods should
be instructed in all things, and that thereby philosophy and magic might
provide nourishment for the soul, and medicine might heal the sufferings
of the flesh.
<p>Having performed all these things, O my son, and seeing the world arrived
at its fulness, Osiris and I were recalled by the inhabitants of heaven;
but we could not return thither without having first praised the Lord,
so that the celestial Vision might fill the expanse, and that the way of
a happy ascension might open before us, since God delights in hymns.

in it.

<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>3:[1] The text of this passage presents great difficulties and uncertainties.
The words in Canter's edition, [Greek], Canter reads Asclepios, Amnion,
and Hephaistobulus. Patrizzi changes [Greek] into [Greek] and renders it
Asclepios Imuthes, Spanos and Heph&aelig;stobulus. Others read [Greek]
in place of [Greek], which is plausible enough, but at the same time they
preserve [Greek], and then [Greek] becomes a surname of Asclepios, who
would thus be son of Pan and Hephaistoboul&egrave;, an absolutely unknown
goddess. But in another fragment we read, a little further on, [Greek]
and [Greek], and the word [Greek] indicates that it refers to the same
Asclepios, and not to two persons of the same name. It may be, then, that
Imouth&egrave; was the name of his mother, as Fabricius supposes. Is it
not likely that it is the Greek form of "Mouth"? The Egyptian Asclepios
was represented bald, according to Syn&eacute;sios; the word [Greek], which
means bald, might then be retained. But in this case, in order that the
phrase may have a meaning, it would be necessary to change [Greek] into
[Greek], and translate:--- Asclepios, the bald Imouth&egrave;s, and counsellor
of Hephaistos.
<p>3:[2] This sentence is very obscure; the participles are in the masculine,
as though the author had forgotten that a goddess was speaking. I believe
the text of the passage must have been altered.
<p>7:[1] This recital of the creation of the souls recalls the Tim&aelig;us
of Plato. After all the Gods were born, the Artificer of the universe thus
addressed them: "Gods of gods, of whom I am the Creator and Father, and
who, formed by me, are by my will indissoluble, learn what I now say to
you... In order that mortal natures may exist, and that the universe may
be indeed universal, turn yourselves according to your nature to the formation
of animals, imitating the power which I employed in the generation of yourselves...
I myself will deliver the seeds and beginnings; and for the rest do you
weave together the mortal and immortal nature, constructing and producing
animals." He said, and into the same cup in which He had mingled and tempered
the soul of the universe, He poured the residue, and mixed it in the same
manner, but in less pure combinations of a second and third order. And
having constituted the universe, He allotted souls to the stars in equal
number, distributing each to each; and causing every one to mount his vehicle,
He displayed to them the nature of the universe, and taught them the laws
of Destiny.
<p>It may be added, also, that this legend, quaint and grotesque as it
is in many of its details, is, likewise, in accord with the Kabbala, which
recounts the pre-mundane history of the souls, their creation, their transgression,
and their punishment, in much the same fashion. The creation of the visible
world by the "working gods," or Titans, as agents for the Supreme God,
is a thoroughly Hermetic idea, recognizable in all religious systems, and
in accord with modern scientific research, which shews us everywhere the
Divine Power operating secretly through natural forces.
<p>8:[1] In reading this allegory, it must be borne in mind that the word
"Soul" is used as a general term for all Egos or Intelligences, whether
Genii or Men. Further, that in these Fragments, as in the Hebrew Scriptures,
the same truths are repeated under different symbols in different passages.
Hence the creation of Nature and of "differentiated forms" has already
been otherwise depicted in a previous paragraph; and the whole process
of the evolution of the Soul has been epitomized in the fable of the making
of the protoplasm. The descent into generation occurs, actually, when the
Titans first begin the manipulation of this protoplasm. The human body,
although last in manifestation, is really the first in the Divine intention,
and is the ultimate cause of all the series of objective forms. Hermetically
speaking, there is nothing in the whole universe, save Man.
<p>10:[1] Heeren sees in these metaphors an allusion to the creation of
Pandora in Hesiod. They recall also a passage in the Pymander, wherein
the Rulers of the Seven Planets cause Man to participate in their nature;
an idea developed likewise by Macrobius in his commentary on the <i>Dream
of Scipio</i>. --- Lib. L., chap. xii.
<p>10:[2] Canter translates this by atramenturn, which would signify initiation
by writing; but it is possible that the heads of the initiated persons
were covered with a black veil, or perhaps the veil of Isis is here intended.
<p>12:[1] It has been questioned whether Hermetic doctrine affirms the
Hindu theory of transmigration, to wit--the possibility of the passage
of the guilty Ego into lower forms than that of man. We must, I hold, admit
the orthodoxy of the doctrine, which, when rightly understood, involves
no paradox. In the Divine Pymander, it is clearly set forth that if a human
soul continue evil "it shall neither taste of immortality nor be partaker
of the good, but being drawn back it returneth into creeping things; and
this is the condemnation of an evil soul." Yet, Trismegistus hastens immediately
to explain and qualify this statement by adding that such a calamity cannot
befall any truly human soul --- that is, a soul possessing the divine Mind,
however fallen from grace, for so long as the soul retains this living
fire --- p. 11, it is the soul of a man, and man "is not to be compared
to any brute beast upon the earth, but to them that are above in heaven,
that are called Gods." But there is a condition so low and lost that at
length the divine flame is quenched, and the soul is left dark and Godless,
a human soul no longer. "And such a soul, O Son," says Hermes, "hath no
Mind; wherefore neither must such an one be called Man." Therefore, while
it is true that "no other body is capable of a human soul, neither is it
lawful for a man's soul to fall into the body of an unreasonable living
thing," so also is it true that a soul, bereft of its Divine Particle which
alone made it human, is human no longer, and, following the universal law
of affinity, straightway gravitates to its proper level, sinking to its
similars, and drawn to its analogues. Nevertheless, when its purgation
is accomplished, such a soul may "come to itself and say, I will arise
and go unto my Father."
<p>There are some Rabbis indeed who have thought such an occult significance
to lie hid in the parable of the prodigal; swine being accounted universally
a figure of lust and sordid desire. The Hermetic doctrine, thus interpreted,
is identical with that of the Kabbala on the same point, as we shall elsewhere
have occasion to shew; and also with the teaching of Apollonius of Tyana.--(v.
<i>Perfect
Way</i>, III., 21, etc.)
<p>16:[1] This name appears to have been a marginal interpolation, inserted
into the text by a copyist. It serves as a key to what follows, Adrastia
(or Nemesis) being the personification of the necessary law (or inflexible
instrument) of which Hermes is about to speak.
<p>18:[1] In the Book of Enoch a similar legend appears--"The Giants turned
themselves upon men to devour them, and began to do evil to birds and beasts
of the field and reptiles and fish; and they devoured with one accord their
flesh and drank their blood. When the earth lifted up her voice against
the unjust,... and because of the perdition of men, a cry arose that came
even unto heaven. Therefore, Michael and Gabriel, and Souryan and Ouryan,
looked forth from the height of heaven, and beheld the abundance of blood
that was shed upon the earth, and all the iniquity that was accomplished,
and they said one to another:--The voice of their cries ascends, the clamour
of the earth is heard even at the gates of heaven, and before you, O holy
ones of the skies, the souls of men complain, saying --- Avenge us in the
presence of the Lord. (VII. 14, 15; VIII. 8, 9; IX. 1, 2, 3.)
<p>See also the first book of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, V., VI., VII.
In all these accounts it appears that mankind is inspired to wickedness
and impiety by the Giants, who are, in Hermetic teaching, explained to
be the lower mundane forces, or "fallen Angels." They are, probably, the
first created "souls" mentioned in an early passage of the allegory, and
are elsewhere spoken of as Demons. Almost all the poets, whether Hebrew,
Hellenic, Hindu, Persian, Norse, or Christian, celebrate the revolt of
the Giants against heaven. It is needless to remind the reader that all
these sacred fables have an esoteric and individual application, related
to the Microcosm within man, as well as to the Macrocosm or world without.
The text is manifestly imperfect.

<br>
<p>O MY illustrious son, if thou wilt know any-thing further, ask it of
me. And Horos said, Revered Mother, I would fain know how royal souls are
born. And Isis answered:--Herein, my son Horos, lies the distinctive character
of royal souls. There are in the universe, four regions, governed by a
fixed and immutable law: heaven, the ether, the air, and the most holy
earth. Above, in heaven, dwell the Gods, ruled as are all the rest, by
the Maker of the universe; in the ether are the stars, governed by the
great fire, the sun; in the air are the souls of the genii, governed by
the moon; upon earth are men and other animals governed by the soul who,
for the time, is their king. For the Gods themselves engender those who
shall be kings befitting the terrestrial race. Princes are the issue of
kings, and he who is most kingly, is a greater king than the rest. [1]
The sun, nearer to God than is the moon, is greater and stronger than she,
and to him she is subject as much by rank as by power. The king is the
last of the Gods and the first of men. So long as he sojourns upon earth,
his divinity is concealed, but he possesses something which distinguishes
him from other men and approximates him to God. The soul in him comes from
a loftier region than that from which descend the souls of common men.
Souls destined to reign upon the earth descend thither for two causes.
There are those who in former lives have lived blameless, and who merit
apotheosis; for such as these royalty is a preparation for the divine state.
Again, there are holy souls who, for some slight infringement of the interior
and divine law, receive in royalty a penance whereby the suffering and
shame of incarnation are mitigated. The condition of these in taking a
body resembles not that of others; they are as blessed as when they were
free. [2]
<p>As to the various characters of these kings, the variety is not in the
souls, for all are royal, but it is due to the nature of the angels and
genii who assist them. For souls destined to such offices are not without
ministers and escort. Heavenly justice, even while exiling them from the
abodes of the Blessed, treats them as their nature befits. When, then,
O my son Horos, the ministering angels and genii appointed are warlike,
the soul in their charge takes that character, forgetting its own, or rather
laying it aside until some future change of condition. If the guardian
angels are of a gentle order, then the soul follows its path in peace;
if they are friends of judgment, the soul loves to judge; if they are musicians,
then the soul sings; if they love truth, the soul is that of a philosopher.
Thus the souls necessarily follow the teaching of their guardians; falling
into human bodies they forego their proper estate, and while exiled from
it they approximate to those intelligences by whom they have been embodied.
<p>Thine explanation is complete, my mother, said Horos, but thou hast
not yet informed me in what manner noble souls are born.
<p>There are upon earth, O my son, different offices. So also is it among
souls; they occupy different stations, and that soul which issues from
a more exalted sphere is nobler than the rest; even as he who is free among
men, is nobler than the slave. Exalted and royal souls are necessarily
the masters of men.
<p>How are souls born male or female?
<p>Souls, my son Horos, are all equal in nature, since they come from one
region wherein the Creator has formed them. There are not among them either
males or females; this distinction exists only between bodies, and not
between incorporeal beings. But some are more energetic, some are gentler;
and this belongs to the air in which all things are formed. For an airy
body envelopes the soul; in it are the elements of earth, water, air, and
fire. Among females this combination contains more of cold and of moisture
than of dryness and heat, and the soul which is enfolded therein is watery
and disposed to softness. The contrary happens among males; their envelope
contains more of dryness and of heat, less of cold and of moisture; hence
in bodies so formed the souls manifest greater vivacity and energy.
<p>And how, O my mother, are born the souls of the wise?
<p>And Isis answered: --- The organ of vision is enveloped in tunics. When
these tunics are thick and dense, the sight is dull; when they are fine
and subtle, the sight is penetrating. Even so is it with the soul; she
likewise has her coverings, incorporeal as herself. These coverings are
the interior airs; when they are subtle, clear, and transparent, then the
soul is perspicuous; when, on the contrary, they are dense, thick, and
turgid, then she cannot see far; and discerns only, as though in cloudy
weather, that which lies immediately before her steps.
<p>And Horos said: --- For what reason, my mother, are the minds of men
who are not of our holy country less open than the minds of those who belong
to it? And Isis replied [1]: --- The earth is set in the midst of the universe
like a man lying on his back and gazing into heaven, and the various regions
of earth correspond to the different members of the man. The earth turns
her gaze towards heaven as towards her father, following in her changes
the changes of the skies. Her head lies to the south, her right shoulder
to the east, her left is turned towards the Lybian wind, her feet are under
the constellation of the Bear, the right beneath the tail, and the left
beneath the head of the Bear; her loins are under the regions of heaven
nearest to the Bear; the midst of her body is beneath the centre of heaven.
Behold as a proof of these things, how they who dwell in the South have
a beautiful countenance and plentiful hair, while the orientals have hands
hardy in conflict and ready with the bow, for they are right-handed; the
westerns are strong and fight with the left hand, attributing to the left
side the functions which belong in others to the right; those who dwell
beneath the Bear are distinguished by the attributes of their feet, and
by the beauty of their legs; those who inhabit beyond the Bear in the climate
of Italy and of Greece are remarkable for the beauty of their loins, and
hence their tendency to prefer males. This part of the body also, being
whiter than the rest, produces men of a whiter hue. The hallowed region
of our ancestors is in the midst of the earth, and since the midst of the
human body is the seat of the heart, and the heart of the soul, this is
why, my son, the men of this land, beside the qualities which all men possess
in common, have also a loftier intelligence and wisdom, because the heart
of the earth brings them forth and nourishes them.
<p>Moreover, my son, the south is the storehouse of the clouds; it is there
they assemble, and thence, it is said, flows our river (Nile), when the
cold becomes abundant. Now, where the clouds descend, the air grows thick
and is filled with vapours which spread themselves as a veil not only over
the sight, but over the intelligence. The east, my son Horos, is continually
disturbed and glowing under the sunrise, as is the west under the sunset;
there-fore, they who dwell in these regions can hardly preserve a clear
perception. The north, by means of its icy temperature, thickens the mind
even as it does the body.
<p>The central land alone, clear and serene, is favoured as are those who
inhabit her. She brings forth in a perpetual tranquillity, she adorns and
completes her offspring, she contends alone against all others, she triumphs,
and like a worthy ruler partakes with the vanquished the fruits of victory.
<p>Explain to me further, my august Mother, what it is that causes in living
men during long maladies, an alteration of discernment, of reason, even
of the soul itself.
<p>And Isis answered: --- Among animals there are those who have affinity
with fire, others with water, others with earth, others with air, others
again with two or three elements, or with all the four. Or, inversely,
some have an antipathy for fire, some for water, some for earth, some for
air, or again for two, three or four elements. Thus, the locust and all
kinds of insects flee from the fire; the eagle, the hawk, and other birds
of flight fear the water; the fish dread the air and earth; the serpent
abhors the open air, and like all crawling creatures loves the ground;
all fishes delight in the deep, the birds in the air where they pass their
lives; those who fly highest delight in the fire (of the sun) and sojourn
in its vicinity. There are even certain creatures who disport themselves
in the fire, such are the salamanders who have their abode in it. The elements
enfold the body, and every soul inhabiting a body is weighed down and enchained
by the four elements; wherefore, it is natural that the soul should have
affinity with certain elements and aversion for others, for which reason
she cannot enjoy perfect happiness. Nevertheless, as the soul is of divine
origin, she struggles and meditates even beneath this bodily covering;
but her thoughts are not what they would be if she were free from the body.
And if the body be disturbed and troubled by sickness or by terror, the
soul herself is tossed about like a man in the midst of tempestuous waves.

<p><b>PART III.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>THOU hast given me admirable instruction, O my most powerful Mother
Isis, concerning the marvellous creation of Souls by God, and I am filled
with wonder; but thou hast not yet shewn me whither souls depart when set
free from bodies. Fain would I contemplate this mystery, and thank only
thee for the initiation.
<p>And Isis said: --- Hearken, my son, for thy most necessary enquiry holds
an important place, and may not be neglected. Hear my reply.
<p>O great and marvellous scion of the illustrious Osiris, think not that
souls on quitting the body mix themselves confusedly in the vague immensity
and become dispersed in the universal and infinite spirit, without power
to return into bodies, to preserve their identity, or to seek again their
primeval abode. Water spilt from a vase returns no more to its place therein,
it has no proper locality, it mingles itself with the mass of waters; but
it is not thus with souls, O most wise Horos. I am initiated into the mysteries
of the immortal nature; I walk in the ways of the truth, and I will reveal
all to thee without the least omission. And first I will tell thee that
water, being a body without reason, composed of myriads of fluid particles,
differs from the soul which is, my son, a personal entity, the royal work
of the hands and of the mind of God, abiding herself in intelligence. That
which proceeds from Unity, and not from multiplicity, cannot mingle with
other things, and in order that the soul may be joined to the body, God
subjects this harmonious union to Necessity.
<p>Souls do not, then, return confusedly, nor by chance, into one and the
same place, but each is despatched into the condition which belongs to
her. And this is deter-mined by that which the soul experiences while yet
she is in the tenement of the body, loaded with a burden contrary to her
nature. Hear: therefore, this comparison, O beloved Horos; suppose that
there should be shut up in the same prison, men, eagles, doves, swans,
hawks, swallows, sparrows, flies, serpents, lions, leopards, wolves, dogs,
hares, oxen, sheep, and certain amphibious animals, such as seals, hydras,
turtles, crocodiles, and that at the same moment all the creatures should
be liberated. All at once would escape; the men would seek cities and the
public places, the eagles the ether, where nature teaches them to live,
the doves the lower air, the hawks the higher expanse; the swallows would
repair to places frequented by men, the sparrows to the orchards, the swans
to districts where they could sing; the flies would haunt the proximity
of the ground as high only as human exhalations extend, for the property
of flies is to live on these and to flit over the surface of the earth;
the lions and leopards would flee to the mountains, the wolves to the solitudes;
the dogs would follow the track of man; the hares would betake themselves
to the woods, the oxen to the fields and meadows, the sheep to the pastures;
the serpents would seek the caves of the earth; the seals and the turtles
would rejoin their kind in the shallows and running waters, in order to
enjoy, conformably to their nature, alike the proximity of the shore and
of the deep. Each creature would return, conducted by its own interior
discernment, into the abode befitting it. Even so every soul, whether human
or inhabiting the earth under other conditions, knows whither she ought
to go; unless, indeed, some son of Typhon should pretend that a bull may
subsist in the waters or a turtle in the air. If, then, even when immersed
in flesh and blood, souls do not infringe the law of order, although under
penance, --- for union with the body is a penance,--how much more shall
they conform thereto when delivered from their bonds and set at liberty!
<p>Now this most holy law, which extends even unto heaven, is on this wise,
O illustrious child: behold the hierarchy of souls! The expanse between
the empyrean and the moon is occupied by the Gods, the stars, and the powers
of providence. Between the moon and ourselves, my son, is the abode of
the souls. The unmeasured air, which we call the wind, has in itself an
appointed way in which it moves to refresh the earth, as I shall by and
by relate. But this movement of the air upon itself impedes not the way
of the souls, nor does it hinder them from ascending and descending without
obstacle; they flow across the air without mingling in it, or confounding
themselves therewith, as water flows over oil. This expanse, my son, is
divided into four provinces, and into sixty regions. The first province
from the earth upwards comprehends four regions, and extends as far as
certain summits or promontories, which it is unable to transcend. The second
province comprises eight regions in which the motions of the winds arise.
Be thou attentive, my son, for thou hearest the ineffable mysteries of
the earth, the heavens, and of the sacred fluid which lies between. [1]
In the province of the winds fly the birds; above this there is no moving
air nor any creature. But the air with all the beings it contains distributes
itself into all boundaries within its reach, and into the four quarters
of the earth, while the earth cannot lift itself into the mansions of the
air. The third province comprehends sixteen regions filled with a pure
and subtle element. The fourth contains thirty-two regions, in which the
air, wholly subtle and diaphanous, allows itself to be penetrated by the
element of fire. Such is the order which, without confusion, reigns from
depth to height; --- to wit, four general divisions, twelve intervals,
sixty regions, and in these dwell the souls, each according to the nature
thereof. They are indeed all of one substance, but they constitute a hierarchy;
and the further any region is removed from the earth, the loftier is the
dignity of the souls which dwell therein.
<p>And now it remains to be explained to thee, O most glorious Horos, what
souls they are who abide in each of these regions, and this I shall set
forth, beginning by the most exalted.
<p>The expanse which stretches between earth and heaven is divided into
regions, my son Horos, according to measure and harmony. To these regions
our ancestors have given various names; some call them zones, others firmaments,
others spheres. Therein dwell the souls who are freed from bodies, and
those who have not yet been incorporated. The stations which they occupy
correspond with their dignity. In the upper region are the divine and royal
souls; the baser souls --- they who float over the surface of the earth
--- are in the lowest sphere, and in the middle regions are the souls of
ordinary degree. Thus, my son, the souls destined to rule descend from
the superior zones, and when they are delivered from the body, thither
they return, or even higher still, unless indeed they have acted contrary
to the dignity of their nature and to the laws of God. For, if they have
transgressed, the Providence on high causes them to descend into the lower
regions according to the measure of their faults; and in like manner also
it conducts other souls, inferior in power and dignity, from the lower
spheres into a more exalted abode. For on high dwell two ministers of the
universal Providence; one is guardian of the souls, the other is their
conductor, who sends them forth and ordains for them bodies. The first
minister guards them, the second releases or binds them, according to the
will of God.
<p>In this wise the law of equity presides over the changes which take
place above, even as upon earth also it moulds and constructs the vessels
in which the souls are immured. This law is supplemented by two energies,
Memory and Experience. Memory directs in Nature the preservation and maintenance
of all the original types appointed in heaven; the function of Experience
is to provide every soul descending into generation with a body appropriate
thereto; so that passionate souls should have vigorous bodies; slothful
souls sluggard bodies; active souls active bodies; gentle souls gentle
bodies; powerful souls powerful bodies; cunning souls dexterous bodies;
--- briefly, that every soul should have a befitting nature. For it is
not without just cause that winged creatures are clothed with feathers;
that intelligent creatures are gifted with finer senses and superior to
others; that beasts of the field are furnished with horns, with tusks,
with claws, or other weapons; that reptiles are endowed with undulating
and flexible bodies, and lest the moisture of their natures should render
them feeble, are armed either with teeth or with pointed scales, so that
they are, even less than others, in peril of death. As for fishes, these
timid souls have allotted to them for a dwelling-place that element in
which light is bereft of its double activity, for in the water, fire neither
illuminates nor burns. Each fish, swimming by the help of his spiny fins,
flies where he wills, and his weakness is protected by the obscurity of
the deep. Thus are souls immured in bodies resembling themselves; in human
shape, those souls who have received reason; in flying creatures, souls
of a wild nature; in beasts, souls without reason, whose only law is force;
in reptiles, deceitful souls, for they attack not their prey face to face,
but by ambush; while fishes enshrine those timid souls who merit not the
enjoyment of other elements.
<p>In every order of animals there are individuals who transgress the laws
of their being.
<p>In what way, my Mother? said Horos.
<p>And Isis answered: In this wise: --- A man who acts against reason,
a beast which eludes necessity, a reptile which forgets its cunning, a
fish which loses its timidity, a bird which renounces freedom. Thou hast
heard what was to be said concerning the hierarchy of souls, their descent,
and the creation of bodies.
<p>O my son, in every order of souls there are found a few royal souls,
and of divers characters: some fiery, some cold, some proud, some gentle,
some crafty, some simple, some contemplative, some active. This diversity
belongs to the regions from whence they descend into bodies. From the royal
zone the royal souls go forth, but there are many royalties; the royalty
of spirit, of the flesh, of art, of science, of the virtues.
<p>And how, said Horos, dost thou name these royalties?
<p>O my son, the king of souls who have hitherto existed is thy father
Osiris; the king of bodies is the prince of each nation, he who governs.
The king of wisdom is the Father of all things; the Initiator is the thrice
great Hermes; over medicine presides Asclepios, the son of Hephaistos;
force and power are under the sway of Osiris, and after him, under thine,
my son. Philosophy depends on Arnebaskenis; poetry, yet again, on Asclepios,
Imouth&egrave;'s son. So that, if thou thinkest thereon, thou wilt perceive
that there are indeed many royalties and many kings.
<p>But the supreme royalty belongs to the highest region; lesser kingships
correspond to the spheres which bring them forth. Those who issue from
the fiery zone handle fire; those who come from the watery zone frequent
liquid spheres; from the region of art and learning those are born who
devote themselves to art and science; from the region of inactivity, those
who live in ease and idleness. All that is done and said upon earth has
its origin in the heights, from whence all essences are dispensed with
measure and equilibrium; nor is there anything which does not emanate from
above and return thither.
<p>Explain to me this that thou sayest, O my Mother.
<p>And Isis answered: --- An evident token of these exchanges has been
stamped on all creatures by most holy Nature. The breath which we indraw
from the upper air we exhale and again inbreathe by means of the lungs
within us which perform this work. And when the way destined to receive
our breath is closed, then no longer do we remain on earth; we depart hence.
Moreover, O my glorious son, there are other accidents by which the balance
of our combination may be destroyed. 1
<p>What is, then, this combination, O my Mother?
<p>It is the union and admixture of the four elements, whence emanates
a vapour which envelops the soul, penetrates into the body and communicates
to both its own character. Thus are produced varieties among souls and
bodies. If in the composition of a body, fire dominates, then the soul
being already of an ardent nature, receives thereby an excess of heat which
renders it the more energetic and furious, and the body the more vivacious
and active. If the air dominates, the body and soul of the creature are
thereby rendered unstable, errant and restless. The domination of the water
causes the soul to be mild, affable, bland, sociable, and easily moulded,
because water blends and mixes itself readily with all other things, dissolves
them if it be abundant, moistens and penetrates them if it be less in quantity.
A body softened by too much humidity offers but a weak resistance, a slight
malady disintegrates it, and little by little dissolves its cohesion. Again,
if the earthy element be dominant, the soul is obtuse, because the body
lacks subtlety, nor can she force a way through the density of its organism.
Therefore, the soul remains indrawn upon herself, borne down by the burden
she supports, and the body is solid, inactive, and heavy, moving only with
effort.
<p>But if the elements be all in just equilibrium, then the whole nature
is ardent in its actions, subtle in its motions, fluent in its sensations,
and of a robust constitution. Of the predominance of air and fire birds
are born, whose nature resembles that of the elements which generate them.
Men are endowed with an abundance of fire united with but a little air,
and of water and earth equal parts. This excess of fire becomes sagacity,
seeing that intelligence is indeed a kind of flame, which consumes not,
but which penetrates. The predominance of water and earth with a sufficient
admixture of air and but little fire engenders beasts; those endued with
more fire than the rest are the more courageous. Water and earth in equal
quantities give birth to reptiles, which, being deprived of fire, have
neither courage nor truthfulness, while the excess of water renders them
cold, that of earth, sordid and heavy, and the lack of air makes all their
movements difficult. Much water with but little earth produces fishes;
the absence of fire and air in them causes their timidity, and disposes
them to lie hidden, while the predominance of water and earth in their
nature approximates them by natural affinity to earth dissolved in water.
Moreover, by means of the proportional increase of the elements composing
the body is the body itself increased, and its development ceases when
the full measure is attained. And so long, my beloved son, as equilibrium
is maintained in the primitive combination and in the vapours arising therefrom,
that is, so long as the normal proportion of fire, air, earth, and water
remains unchanged, the creature continues in health. But if the elements
deviate from the proportion originally determined--(I speak not now of
the growth of activities, nor of that resulting from a change of order,
but of a rupture of equilibrium whether by addition or diminution of fire
or of other elements)--then malady supervenes. And should air and fire,
whose nature is one with that of the soul itself, prevail in the conflict,
then, through the dominance of those elements, destroyers of the flesh,
the creature abandons its proper state. For the earthy element is the pabulum
of the body, and the water wherewith it is permeated contributes to consolidate
it; but it is the aerial element which confers motion, and the fire engenders
all energies. The vapours produced by the union and combination of these
elements blending with the soul, as it were by fusion, bear her along with
them, and clothe her in their own nature, whether good or evil. So long
as she remains in this natural association the soul keeps the rank she
has attained. But if a change should occur either in the combination itself
or in any of its parts or subdivisions, the vapours, altering their condition,
alter likewise the relations between soul and body; the fire and air, aspiring
upward, draw with them the soul, their sister, while the watery and terrestrial
elements, which tend earthwards like the body, weigh it down and overwhelm
it.

<p><b>PART I.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Hermes:
<p>IT is a God who hath brought thee to us, Asclepios, that thou mayst
assist at a divine discourse, and one which will be the most truly religious
of all we have as yet held, or with which we have been inspired from on
high. In understanding it thou wilt be in possession of all blessings,--if
so be indeed there are several, and if it be not more correct to say there
is but one blessing which comprises all. For each one of them is bound
to another; all are derived from one and make but one, so that their mutual
bonds make separation impossible. This is what thou wilt understand by
paying attention to that which we are about to say. But first, Asclepios,
go away for a little while and look for another hearer for our discourse.
<p>[Asclepios proposes to call Ammon.]
<p>There is no objection to Ammon's presence among us, says Trismegistos.
I have not forgotten that I have addressed to him, as to a dear son, several
writings on Nature and other subjects relating to exoteric teaching. But
it is thy name, Asclepios, which I shall inscribe at the head of the present
treatise. And call no other person than Ammon. For a discourse upon the
holiest matters of religion would be profaned by a too numerous audience.
It is an impiety to deliver to the knowledge of a great number, a treatise
full of divine majesty. [1]
<p>[Ammon enters the sanctuary, and completes the holy quartet, 2 filled
with the presence of God. The invitation to devotional silence comes from
the lips of Hermes, and in the presence of the attentive souls who hang
upon his words, the divine Love thus begins:--] [1]
<p>Every human soul, Asclepios, is immortal; but this immortality is not
uniform. It differs both in mode and in duration.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>It is because souls, Trismegistos, are not all of the same quality.
<p>Hermes:
<p>How quickly thou understandest the reason of things, Asclepios! I have
not yet said that all is one and that one is all, since all things were
in the Creator before the creation and we can call Him all since all things
are His members. Wherefore, throughout all this discourse, bear in mind
Him who is One and All, the Creator of all things.
<p>Everything descends from heaven upon the earth, into the water, into
the air: only fire is vivifying, because it tends upwards; that which tends
downwards is subordinate to it. That which descends from above is generative;
that which emanates and rises is nutritive. The earth, alone self-supported,
is the receptacle of all things, and reconstructs the types which she receives.
That Universal Being which contains all and which is all, puts into motion
the soul and the world, all that nature comprises. In the manifold unity
of universal life, the innumerable individualities distinguished by their
variations, are, nevertheless, united in such a manner that the whole is
one, and that everything proceeds from unity.
<p>Now this unity, which constitutes the world, is formed of four elements:
fire, water, earth, and air:--one single world, one single soul, and one
single God. Lend me now all the powers and all the penetration of thy thought;
for the idea of Divinity, which cannot be conceived save by divine assistance,
resembles a rapid stream precipitating itself onwards with impetuosity,
and often, therefore, outstrips the attention of the listeners, and even
of him who teaches.
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>46: [1] It is the indiscriminate disclosure of spiritual mysteries to
those who, by reason of their exclusively fleshly condition, are incapable
of appreciating and reverencing then, that is called by Jesus a casting
of pearls before swine.
<p>46: [2] The fourth being Tatios, the son of Trismegistos. All such discourses
required--for occult reasons--the presence of a minimum number of four.
The four above represented the four great divisions of existence, and constituted
an epitome of the Universe. "The form of the fourth is like the Son of
God," Nabuchodonosor is made to exclaim in the Hermetic allegory in Daniel,
representing the transmutation --- instead of the expected destruction
---of the earthly elements of Man under the fiery alchemic ordeal of suffering.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>HEAVEN --- God manifest --- regulates all bodies.
<p>Their growth and their decline are determined by the sun and the moon.
But He who directs heaven --- the soul itself and all that exists in the
world --- is very God, the Creator.
<p>From the heights where He reigns descend innumerable influences which
spread themselves throughout the world, into all souls both general and
particular, and into the nature of things.
<p>The world has been prepared by God in order to receive all particular
forms. Realising these forms by means of Nature, He has updrawn the world
to heaven through the four elements.
<p>Everything is in accordance with the designs of God; but that which
originates from on high has been separated into individualities in the
following manner. The types of all things follow their (representative)
individualities in such way that the type is a whole; the individual is
a part of the type.
<p>Thus the Gods constitute a type, the genii also. Similarly, men, birds,
and all beings which the world contains, constitute types producing individuals
resembling them.
<p>There is yet another type, without sensation, but not without soul.
It consists of those beings which sustain themselves by means of roots
fixed in the earth. Individualities of this type are found everywhere.
<p>Heaven is full of God. The types of which we have spoken have their
habitation extending up to that of the beings whose individualities are
immortal. For the individuality is a part of the type, as, for instance,
man is a part of humanity; and each one follows the character of its type.
Hence it comes that, while all types are imperishable, individuals are
not all imperishable.
<p>Divinity forms a type of which all the individualisations are as immortal
as itself. Among other beings eternity belongs only to the type; the individual
perishes, and is perpetuated only by reproduction. There are, then, some
mortal individualities. Thus man is mortal, humanity is immortal.
<p>Nevertheless, individuals of all the types mix with all the types. Some
are primitive; others are produced by these, by God, by genii, by men,
and all resemble their respective types.
<p>For bodies can be formed only by the divine will; individualities cannot
be characterised without the aid of the genii; the education and training
of animals cannot be conducted without man.
<p>All those genii who have forsaken their own type, and become joined
in individuality to an individuality of the divine type, are regarded as
neighbours and associates of the Gods.
<p>The genii who preserve the character of their type, and are properly
called genii, love that which relates to mankind. The human type resembles,
or even surpasses, theirs; for the individuality of the human is manifold
and various, and results from the association mentioned above. It is the
indispensable link between nearly all other individualities.
<p>The man who has affinity with the Gods through the intelligence which
he shares with them, and through piety, is the neighbour of God. He who
has affinity with the genii approximates himself to them. They who are
satisfied with human mediocrity remain a part of the human type. Other
human individualities will be neighbours of the types or individualities
with which they shall be in affinity.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">

<p><b>PART III.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>MAN, then, Asclepios, is a great marvel; a creature worthy of respect
and adoration. For amid this divine Nature he moves as if he himself were
a God. He knows the order of the genii, and, aware that he is of the same
origin, he despises the human side of his being in order to attach himself
exclusively to the divine element.
<p>How happily constituted and near to the Gods is humanity! In joining
himself to the divine, man disdains that which he has in him of the earthly;
he connects himself by a bond of love to all other beings, and thereby
feels himself necessary to the universal order. He contemplates heaven;
and in this happy middle sphere in which he is placed, he loves all that
is below him, he is beloved of all that is above. He cultivates the earth;
he borrows the speed of the elements; his piercing thought fathoms the
deeps of the sea. Everything is clear for him. Heaven does not seem to
him too high, for knowledge lifts him to it. The brightness of his mind
is not obscured by the thick mists of the air; the earth's gravitation
is no obstacle to his efforts; the profundity of deep seas does not disturb
him; he includes everything and remains everywhere the same.
<p>All animate beings have as it were roots passing downwards; inanimate
beings, on the contrary, have a single root passing from below upwards,
and supporting a whole forest of branches. Some creatures nourish themselves
upon two elements, others upon one only. There are two kinds of aliment
for the two portions of the creature--one for the soul and another for
the body. The soul of the world sustains itself by perpetual motion. Bodies
develop themselves by means of water and of earth, the aliments of the
inferior world. The spirit which fills everything, mingles with everything,
and vivifies everything, adds consciousness to the intelligence, which,
by a peculiar privilege, man borrows from the fifth element --- the ether.
In man, the consciousness is raised to the knowledge of the divine order.
<p>Since I am led to speak of the consciousness, I will presently expound
to you its function, which is great and holy as that of divinity itself.
But let us first complete the exposition already begun. I was speaking
of union with the Gods --- a privilege which they accord only to humanity.
A few men only have the happiness of rising to that perception of the Divine
which subsists only in God and in the human intelligence.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Are, then, not all men similarly conscient, Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>All, Asclepios, have not the true intelligence. They are deceived when
they suffer themselves to be drawn after the image of things, without seeking
for the true reason of them. It is thus that evil is produced in man; and
that the first of all creatures lowers himself almost to the level of the
brutes. But I will speak to you of the consciousness and all that belongs
to it, when I come to my exposition of the mind. For man alone is a dual
creature. One of the two parts of which he consists is single, and, as
the Greeks say, essential; that is, formed after the divine likeness. The
part which the Greeks call Kosmic --- that is, belonging to the world ---
is quadruple, and constitutes the body, which, in man, serves as an envelope
to the divine principle. This divine principle, and that which belongs
to it, the perceptions of the pure intelligence, conceal themselves behind
the rampart of the body. 1
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>53:[1] "The five elements of the Microcosm are here made to correspond
with the five elements which the Greeks allotted to the Macrocosm; earth,
water, air, fire, and ether. Trismegistos says that man obtains his intelligence
from "the ether--the fifth element." Trismegistos includes in the body
the physical particles, the exterior consciousness, the magnetic forces,
and the sensible or mundane mind. In the fifth element he includes the
immortal part --- soul and spirit; since he speaks of the "divine principle
and that which belongs to it --- the perceptions of the pure intelligence."
The soul, as we have already seen in the "Virgin of the world," is the
percipient principle of man; the spirit is the divine light by means of
which she sees. It is advisable, in this place, to point out, for the sake
of a clear understanding of what follows, that Hermetic doctrine regards
man as having a twofold nature. For he is in one sense a child of the earth,
developed by progressive evolution from below upwards; a true animal, and
therefore bound by strict ties of kinship with the lower races, and of
allegiance to Nature. In the other sense, man descends from above, and
is of celestial origin; because when a certain point in his development
from below is reached, the human soul focuses and fixes the Divine Spirit,
which is peculiarly the attribute of man, and the possession of which constitutes
his sovereignty over all other creatures. And until this vivification of
the soul occurs, man is not truly Man in the Hermetic sense.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Asclepios:
<p>WHY then, O Trismegistos, was it necessary that man should be placed
in the world, instead of where God is, to dwell with Him in supreme beatitude?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Thy question is natural, O Asclepios, and I pray God to assist me in
replying to it, for everything depends upon His will, especially those
great things which are at this moment the subject of our enquiry; listen,
then, to me, Asclepios. The Lord and Author of all things, whom we call
God, brought forth a second God, visible and sensible; I describe him thus,
not because he himself has sensibility, for this is not the place to treat
such a question, but because he is perceptible to the senses. Having then
produced this unique Being who holds the first rank among creatures and
the second after Himself, He found His offspring beautiful and filled with
all manner of good, and He loved it as His own child. [1] He willed, then,
that another should be able to contemplate this Being so great and so perfect
whom He had drawn forth from Himself, and to this end He created man, endowed
with reason and intelligence.
<p>The will of God is absolute accomplishment; to will and to do are for
Him the work of the selfsame instant. And, knowing that the essential could
not apprehend all things unless enveloped by the world, He gave to man
a body for a dwelling-place. He willed that man should have two natures;
He united them intimately and blended them in just proportion.
<p>Thus, He formed man of spirit and of body; of an eternal nature and
of a mortal nature, so that, a creature thus constituted, he might, by
means of his double origin, admire and adore that which is celestial and
eternal; cultivate and govern that which is upon the earth. I speak here
of mortal things, not of the two elements subjected to man, to wit, earth
and water, but of things coming from man, which are in him or depending
on him, such as the culture of the soil, the pastures, the construction
of buildings, of ports, navigation, commerce, and those reciprocal exchanges
which are the strongest bond among men. Earth and water form a part of
the world, and this terrestrial part is sustained by the arts and sciences,
without which the world would be imperfect in the eyes of God. For that
which God wills is necessary, and the effect accompanies His will; nor
can it be believed that anything which has seemed good to Him can cease
to seem good to Him, because from the beginning He knew what should be
and what should please Him.

writings is spoken of as the "Son of God"--"the word made flesh."

<p><b>PART V.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>BUT I perceive, O Asclepios, that thou art anxious to know in what manner
Heaven and those who inhabit it can be the object of the aspiration and
adoration of man; learn, then, O Asclepios, that to aspire after the God
of heaven and all those who are therein is to render them frequent homage;
for alone of all animated beings, divine and human, man is able to render
it. The admiration, adoration, praise, and homage of man rejoice heaven
and the celestial inhabitants; and the choir of the Muses has been sent
among men by the supreme Divinity in order that the terrestrial world might
not be without the sweet science of hymns; or rather that the human voice
might celebrate Him who only is All, since He is the Father of all things,
and that the tender harmonies of earth might ever unite themselves with
the celestial choirs. Only a few men, rarely endowed with a pure intelligence,
are entrusted with this holy function of beholding heaven clearly. Those
in whom the confusion of their two natures holds the intelligence captive
under the weight of the body, are appointed to have communion with the
inferior elements. Man is not, then, debased because he has a mortal part;
on the contrary, this mortality augments his aptitudes and his power; his
double functions are possible to him only by his double nature; he is constituted
in such a manner that he can embrace alike the terrestrial and the divine.
I desire, O Asclepios, that thou mayest bring to this exposition all the
attention and all the ardour of thy mind; for many are wanting in faith
concerning these things. And now I am about to unfold true principles for
the instruction of the holiest intelligences.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b>PART VI.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>THE Master of Eternity is the first God, the world is the second, man
is the third. God, Creator of the world and of all that it contains, governs
all this universe and subjects it to the rule of man. And man makes of
it the object of his special activity. So that the world and man become
the appendage one of the other, and it is with reason that in Greek the
world is called Kosmos. Man knows himself and knows the world; he should,
therefore, distinguish that which is in accord with himself, that which
is for his use and that which has a right to his worship. While addressing
to God his praises and his acts of grace, he should venerate the world
which is the image of God; remembering that he is himself the second image
of God. For God has two similitudes: the world and man. The nature of man
being complex, that part of him which is composed of soul, of consciousness,
of mind, and of reason is divine, and from the superior elements seems
able to mount to heaven; while his cosmic and mundane part, formed of fire,
water, earth, and air, is mortal and remains upon the earth; so that what
is borrowed from the world may be restored to it.
<p>It is thus that mankind is composed of a divine part and of a mortal
part, to wit, the body. The law of this dual being, man, is religion, whose
effect is goodness. Perfection is attained when the virtue of man preserves
him from desire, and causes him to despise all that is foreign to himself.
For terrestrial things, of which the body desires the possession, are foreign
to all parts of the divine Thought. Such things may indeed be called possessions,
for they are not born with us, they are acquired later. They are then foreign
to man, and even the body itself is foreign to man, in such wise that man
ought to disdain both the object of desire, and that whereby he is made
accessible to desire.
<p>It is the duty of man to direct his soul by reason, so that- the contemplation
of the divine may lead him to take but small account of that mortal part
which has been joined to him for the sake of the preservation of the lower
world. In order that man should be complete in both his parts, observe
that each of these possesses four binary subdivisions--to wit, the two
hands and the two feet, which, with the other organs of the body, place
him in relation with the inferior and terrestrial world. And, on the other
hand, he possesses four faculties: sensibility, soul, memory, and foresight,
which permit him to know and perceive divine things. He is able, therefore,
to include in his investigations, differences, qualities, effects, and
quantities. But if he be too much hindered by the weight of the body, he
will be unable to penetrate into the true reason of things.
<p>When man, thus formed and constituted, having received for his function
from the supreme God, the government of the world and the worship of Divinity,
acquits himself well of this double duty, and obeys the holy Will, what
should be his recompense? For, if the world is the work of God, he who
by his care sustains and augments its beauty, is the auxiliary of the divine
Will, employing his body and his daily labour in the service of the work
produced by the hands of God. What should be his recompense, if not that
which our ancestors have obtained? May it please divine goodness to accord
this recompense also to us; all our aspirations and all our prayers tend
towards its attainment; may we, delivered from the prison of the body,
and from our mortal bonds, return, sanctified and pure, to the divine heritage
of our nature!
<p>Asclepios:
<p>What thou sayest is just and true, O Trismegistos! Such indeed is the
price of piety towards God, and of care bestowed on the maintenance of
the world. But return to the heavens is denied to those who have lived
impiously; upon them is imposed a penance which holy souls escape, to wit,
migration into other bodies. The end of this discourse, O Trismegistos,
brings us to the hope of an eternal future for the soul, as the result
of her life in the world. But this future is for some difficult to believe;
for others it is a fable; for others, again, perhaps a subject of derision.
For it is a sweet thing to enjoy what one possesses in the corporeal life.
Therein lies the evil, which, as one may say, turns the soul's head, attaches
her to her mortal part, hinders her from knowing her divine part, and is
envious of immortality. For I say unto thee, by a prophetic inspiration,
no man after us will choose the simple way of philosophy, which lies wholly
in application to the study of divine things, and in holy religion. The
majority of men obscure philosophy with diverse questions. How come they
to encumber it with sciences which ought not to be comprehended in it,
or after what manner do they mingle in it diverse questions?
<p>Hermes:
<p>O Asclepios, they mingle in it, by means of subtleties, a diversity
of sciences which belong not to it --- arithmetic, music, geometry. But
pure, philosophy, whose proper object is holy religion, ought to occupy
itself with other sciences only in so far as to admire the regular phases
of the stars, their positions and their courses, determined by calculation;
the dimensions of the earth, its qualities and quantities; the depth of
the sea; the power of fire; and to know the effects of all these things,
and Nature; to adore Art, the artist, and his divine intelligence. As for
music, that is apprehended when one apprehends reason and the divine order
of things. For this order by which everything is ranged singly in the unity
of the whole, is indeed an admirable harmony and a divine melody.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>What then, after us, will men become?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Misled by the subtleties of the sophists, they will turn aside from
the true, pure and holy philosophy. To adore God in the simplicity of thought
and of the soul, to venerate His works, to bless His will, which alone
is the fulness of good --- this is the only philosophy which is not profaned
by the idle curiosity of the mind. But enough on this matter.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b>PART VII.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>LET us begin to speak of Mind and of other similar things. In the beginning
were God and Hyl&egrave; --- it is thus that the Greeks term the first
matter or substance of the universe. The Spirit was with the universe,
but not in the same manner as with God. The things which constitute the
universe are not God, therefore before their birth they were not in existence,
but they were already contained in that from which they were produced.
For besides and without created things is not only that which is not yet
born, but that also which has no generative fecundity, and which can bring
forth nothing. Everything which has the power of generating contains in
germ all that can be born of it, for it is easy to that which is brought
forth to bear that which shall bring forth. But the eternal God cannot
and never could be born; He is, He has been, He will be always. The nature
of God is to be His own Principle. But matter, or the nature of the world,
and mind, although appearing to be brought forth from the beginning, possess
the power of birth and of procreation --- fecundative energy. For the beginning
is in the quality of Nature, who possesses in herself the potentiality
of conception and of production. She is then, without any foreign intervention,
the principle of creation. It is otherwise with that which possesses only
the power of conception by means of mixing with a second nature. The matrix
of the universe and of all that it contains appears not to have been itself
born, holding however, within it, potentially, all Nature. I call that
the matrix which contains all things, for they could not have been without
a vehicle to contain them. Everything which exists must exist in some place
(or vehicle), neither qualities nor quantities, nor positions, nor effects
could be distinguished in things having no place and being nowhere. Thus
the world, although not having been born, has in it the principle of all
birth; since it affords all things a fitting matrix for conception. It
is, then, the sum-total of qualities and of matter susceptible of creation,
although not yet created.
<p>Matter, being fecund in all attributes, is able also to engender evil.
I put aside, therefore, O Asclepios and Ammon, the question asked by many:---
"Could not God hinder evil in the nature of things?" There is absolutely
nothing to say to them; but for you I will pursue the discourse begun,
and I will give the explanation. They affirm that God ought to have preserved
the world from evil; now, evil is in the world as an integral part of it.
The sovereign God indeed provided against it inasmuch as was reasonable
and possible, when He bestowed upon humanity sentiment, knowledge, and
intelligence. By these faculties solely, which place us above other animals,
we may escape the snares of evil and vice. The man who is wise and protected
by divine intelligence, knows how to preserve himself from such immediately
he beholds them, and before he has been entrapped thereby. The foundation
of knowledge is supreme goodness. Spirit governs and gives life to all
that is in the world; it is an instrument employed by the will of the sovereign
God. Thus we ought to comprehend, by intelligence alone, the supreme Intelligible
called God. By Him is directed that secondary sensible God (the universe),
who contains all spaces, all substances, the matter of all that engenders
and produces, --- in a word, all that is.
<p>As for the spirit (or Mind), it moves and governs all individual beings
in the world according to the nature which God has assigned to them. Matter
--- Hyl&egrave;, or the Kosmos --- is the receptacle, the motion, the replication
of everything which God directs, dispensing to each of them that which
is necessary to it, and filling them with spirit according to their qualities.
<p>The form of the universe is that of a hollow sphere, having in itself
the cause of its quality or of its figure, wholly invisible; if, choosing
any given point of its surface, one should seek to behold its depths, one
would be unable to see anything. It appears visible only by means of those
special forms whose images appear graven upon it, it shows itself only
in effigy; but in reality it is always invisible in itself. Therefore,
the centre, the depths of this sphere --- if indeed one may call it a place
--- is in Greek named Hades, the invisible, from eidein, to see, because
the centre of a sphere, cannot be seen from without. Moreover, the types
or formative appearances were called Ideas, because they are the forms
of the Invisible. This interior of the sphere which the Greeks call Hades,
because it is invisible, the Latins name Hell (Inferno), on account of
its profound position. These are the primordial principles, the first sources,
of all things. Everything is in them, or by them, or comes forth from them.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>These principles are, then, O Trismegistos, the universal substance
of all individual appearances?
<p>Hermes:
<p>The world nourishes bodies, the spirit nourishes souls. Thought, the
heavenly gift which is the happy privilege of humanity, nourishes intelligence,
but few men only have an intelligence capable of receiving such a benefit.
Thought is a light which illuminates the intelligence, as the sun illuminates
the world. And even more, for the light of the sun may be intercepted by
the moon, or by the earth when night comes; but when thought has once penetrated
into the human soul, it mingles intimately with her nature, and the intelligence
can never again be obscured by any cloud. Therefore, with reason, it has
been said that the souls of the Gods are intelligences. As for me, I say
not this of all of them, but of the great supernal Gods.

<br>
<p>Asclepios:
<p>WHAT, O Trismegistos, are the primordial principles of things?
<p>Hermes:
<p>I reveal to thee great and divine mysteries, and in beginning this initiation
I implore the favour of heaven. There are many orders of the Gods; and
in all there is an intelligible part. It is not to be supposed that they
do not come within the range of our senses; on the contrary, we perceive
them, better even than those which are called visible, as this discussion
will inform thee.&nbsp; Thou wilt apprehend this fact if thou lendest all
thine attention to our discourse; for this order of ideas, so sublime,
so divine, so elevated above the intelligence of man, demands an uninterrupted
attention without which speech merely flits across the mind and flees away,
or rather, returns to its source and is lost therein.
<p>There are, then, Gods superior to all appearances; after them come the
Gods whose principle is spiritual; these Gods being sensible, in conformity
with their double origin, manifest all things by a sensible nature, each
of them illuminating his works one by another. 1 The supreme Being of heaven,
or of all that is comprehended under this name, is Zeus, for it is by heaven
that Zeus gives life to all things. The supreme Being of the sun is light,
for it is by the disk of the sun that we receive the benefit of the light.
The thirty-six horoscopes of the fixed stars have for supreme Being or
prince, him whose name is Pantomorphos, or having all forms, because he
gives divine forms to divers types. The seven planets, or wandering spheres,
have for supreme Spirits Fortune and Destiny, who uphold the eternal stability
of the laws of Nature throughout incessant transformation and perpetual
agitation. The ether is the instrument or medium by which all is produced.
<p>Thus, from the centre to the uttermost parts, everything moves, and
relations are established according to natural analogies. That which is
mortal approximates to that which is mortal, that which is sensible to
that which is sensible. The supreme direction belongs to the supreme Master,
in such wise that diversity is resolved into unity. For all things depend
from unity or developeD from it, and because they appear distant from one
another it is believed that they are many, whereas, in their collectivity
they form but one, or rather two, Principles. These two Principles, whence
all things proceed, and by which all exist, are the substance of which
things are formed, and the Will of Him who differentiates them.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>What is the reason of this, O Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>It is this, Asclepios. God is the Father, the universal Ruler --- or
whatever other name yet more holy and religious may be given to Him ---
and which, because of our intelligence, ought to be held sacred between
us; but, in considering His divinity, we cannot define Him by any such
name. For the voice is a sound resulting from the concussion of the air,
and declaring the will of man, or the impression that his mind has received
through the senses. This name, composed of a determined number of syllables,
serving as a token between the voice and the ear, and, moreover, sensation,
breath, air, all that is concerned with, and belonging to its expression
--- these convey this name of God, and I do not think that a name, however
complex it may be, is able to designate the Principle of all majesty, the
Father and Lord of all things. Nevertheless, it is necessary to give Him
a name, or rather every name, since He is one and all; therefore we must
say either that All is His name, or we must call Him by the names of all
things. He, then, who is one and all, possessing the full and entire fecundity
of both sexes, ever impregnated by His own Will, brings forth all that
He has willed to beget. His Will is universal goodness, the selfsame goodness
that exists in all things. Nature is born of His divinity, in such wise
that all things should be as they are, and as they have been, and that
Nature may suffice to generate of herself all that in the future is to
be born. This, O Asclepios, is why and how all things are of two sexes.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Sayest thou this also of God, O Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Not only of God, but of all beings, whether animated or inanimate. For
it is impossible that anything which exists should be barren. Were we to
suppress the fecundity of existing things, it would be impossible for them
to remain what they are. For I say that this law of generation is contained
in Nature, in intellect, in the universe, and preserves all that is brought
forth. The two sexes are full of procreation, and their union, or rather
their incomprehensible at-one-ment, may be known as Eros, or as Aphrodite,
or by both names at once. If the mind can perceive any one truth more certainly
and clearly than another, it is this duty of procreation, which God of
universal Nature has imposed for ever upon all beings, and to which He
has attached the supremest charity, joy, delight, longing, and divinest
love. It would be needful to demonstrate the power and necessity of this
law, if everyone were not able to recognise and perceive it by interior
sentiment. Behold, indeed, how at the moment when from the brain the tide
of life descends, the two natures lose themselves each in each, and one
eagerly seizes and hides within itself the seed of the other! At this moment,
by means of this mutual enchainment, the feminine nature receives the virtue
of the male, and the male reposes on the bosom of its mate. This mystery,
so sweet and so necessary, is enacted in secret, lest the divinity of the
two natures should be constrained to blush before the railleries of the
ignorant, were the union of the sexes exposed to irreligious observation.
For pious men are not numerous in the world; they are, even, rare, and
one might easily count them. In the majority of men malice abides, for
lack of prudence and of knowledge of things of the universe.
<p>The understanding of divine religion, the basis of all things, leads
to the contempt of all vices in the world, and supplies the remedy against
them; but when ignorance asserts itself, then vices develope and inflict
upon the soul an incurable hurt. Infected by vices, the soul is, as it
were, swollen with poison, and can be healed only by knowledge and understanding.
Let us then continue this teaching, even though but a small number should
profit by it; and learn thou, O Asclepios, why to man only God has given
a part of His intelligence and of His knowledge. Wherefore, hearken.
<p>God the Father and the Ruler, after the Gods, 1 formed men by the union
in equal proportions of the corruptible part of the universe and of its
divine part, and thus it happened that the imperfections of the universe
remained mingled in the flesh. The need of nourishment which we have in
common with all creatures, subjects us to desire and to all other vices
of the soul. The Gods, constituted of the purest part of Nature, have no
need of the aid of reasoning or of study; immortality and eternal youth
are for them wisdom and know-ledge. Nevertheless, seeing the unity of Order,
and that they might not be strangers to these things, God bestowed on them
for their reason and their intelligence, the eternal law of Necessity.
<p>Alone, among all creatures, whether to avoid or to overcome the evils
of the flesh, man has the aid of reason and of intelligence, and the hope
of immortality. Man, created good, and capable of immortal life, has been
formed of two natures: one divine, the other mortal; and in thus forming
him, the Divine Will rendered him superior to the Gods, who have an immortal
nature only, as well as to all mortal beings. For this reason, man, united
in close affinity with the Gods, pays them religious service, and the Gods,
in their turn, watch with a tender affection over human affairs. But I
speak here only of pious men; as for the wicked, I will say nothing concerning
them, in order that I may not, by pausing to talk about them, sully the
holiness of this discourse.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>AND since we are brought to speak of the relationship and of the resemblance
between men and Gods, behold, O Asclepios, the power and capacity of man!
Even as the Ruler and Father, or to give Him the loftiest name --- God
is the creator of the firmamental Gods, so is man the creator of the Gods
who dwell in temples, pleased with human proximity, and not only themselves
illumined, but illuminating. And this both profits man and strengthens
the Gods. Dost thou marvel, Asclepios? Dost thou lack faith as do many?
<p>Asclepios:
<p>I am confounded, O Trismegistos; but yielding myself willingly to thy
words, I judge man to be happy in that he has obtained such felicity.
<p>Hermes:
<p>Certes, he deserves admiration, being the greatest of all the Gods!
For the race of the Gods is formed of the purest part of Nature, without
admixture of other elements, and their visible signs are, as it were, only
heads. [1] But the Gods which mankind makes, possess two natures --- one
divine, which is the first and by far the purest, the other belonging to
humanity, which is the matter of which these Gods are composed, so that
they have not only heads, but entire bodies, with all their limbs. Thus
mankind, remembering its nature and its origin, persists in this matter,
in the imitation of Deity, for even as the Father and Lord has made the
eternal Gods after the similitude of Himself, so also has humanity made
its Gods in its own image.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Dost thou speak of the statues, Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Yes, of the statues, Asclepios. See how wanting thou art in faith! Of
what else should I speak but of the statues, so full of life, of feeling,
and of aspiration, which do so many wonderful things; the prophetic statues
which predict the future by bestowing dreams and by all manner of other
ways; which strike us with maladies, or heal our pains according to our
deserts? Art thou not aware, O Asclepios, that Egypt is the image of heaven,
or rather, that it is the projection below of the order of things above?
If the truth must be told, this land is indeed the temple of the world.
Nevertheless --- since sages ought to foresee all things --- there is one
thing thou must know; a time will come when it will seem that the Egyptians
have adored the Gods so piously in vain, and that all their holy invocations
have been barren and unheeded. Divinity will quit the earth and return
to heaven, forsaking Egypt, its ancient abode, and leaving the land widowed
of religion and bereft of the presence of the Gods. Strangers will fill
the earth, and not only will sacred things be neglected, but--more dreadful
still--religion, piety, and the adoration of the Gods will be forbidden
and punished by the laws. Then, this earth, hallowed by so many shrines
and temples, will be filled with sepulchres and with the dead. O Egypt!
Egypt! there will remain of thy religions only vague legends which posterity
will refuse to believe; only words graven upon stones will witness to thy
devotion! The Scythian, the Indian, or some other neighbouring barbarian
will possess Egypt! Divinity will return to heaven; humanity, thus abandoned,
will wholly perish, and Egypt will be left deserted, forsaken of men and
of Gods!
<p>To thee I cry, O most sacred River, to thee I announce the coming doom!
waves of blood, polluting thy divine waters, shall overflow thy banks;
the number of the dead shall surpass that of the living; and if, indeed,
a few inhabitants of the land remain, Egyptians by speech, they will in
manners be aliens! Thou weepest, O Asclepios! But yet sadder things than
these will come to pass. Egypt will fall into apostacy, the worst of all
evils. Egypt, once the holy land beloved of the Gods and full of devotion
for their worship, will become the instrument of perversion, the school
of impiety, the type of all violence. Then, filled with disgust for everything,
man will no longer feel either admiration or love for the world. He will
turn away from this beautiful work, the most perfect alike in the present,
the past, and the future. Nor will the languor and weariness of souls permit
anything to remain save disdain of the whole universe, this immutable work
of God, this glorious and perfect edifice, this manifold synthesis of forms
and images, wherein the will of the Lord, lavish of marvels, has united
all things in a harmonious and single whole, worthy for ever of veneration,
of praise and love! Then darkness will be preferred to light, and death
will be deemed better than life, nor will any man lift his eyes to heaven.
<p>In those days the religious man will be thought mad; the impious man
will be hailed as a sage; savage men will be deemed valiant; the evil-hearted
will be applauded as the best of men. The Soul, and all that belongs thereto
--- whether born mortal or able to attain eternal life --- all those things
which I have herein expounded to thee, will be but matters for ridicule,
and will be esteemed foolishness. There will even be peril of death, believe
me, for those who remain faithful to religion and intelligence. New rights
will be instituted, new laws, nor will there be left one holy word, one
sacred belief, religious and worthy of heaven and of celestial things.
O lamentable separation between the Gods and men! Then there will remain
only evil demons who will mingle themselves with the miserable human race,
their hand will be upon it impelling to all kinds of wicked enterprise;
to war, to rapine, to falsehood, to everything contrary to the nature of
the soul. The earth will no longer be in equilibrium, the sea will no longer
be navigable, in the heavens the regular course of the stars will be troubled.
Every holy voice will be condemned to silence; the fruits of the earth
will become corrupt, and she will be no more fertile; the very air will
sink into lugubrious torpor. Such will be the old age of the world; irreligion
and disorder, lawlessness, and the confusion of good men.
<p>When all these things shall be accomplished, O Asclepios, then the Lord
and Father, the sovereign God who rules the wide world, beholding the evil
ways and actions of men, will arrest these misfortunes by the exercise
of His divine will and goodness. And, in order to put an end to error and
to the general corruption, He will drown the world with a deluge or consume
it by fire, or destroy it by wars and epidemics, and thereafter He will
restore to it its primitive beauty; so that once more it shall appear worthy
of admiration and worship, and again a chorus of praise and of blessing
shall celebrate Him Who has created and redeemed so beautiful a work. This
re-birth of the world, this restoration of all good things, this holy and
sacred rehabilitation of Nature will take place when the time shall come
which is appointed by the divine and ever-eternal will of God, without
beginning and always the same.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Indeed, Trismegistos, the nature of God is Will reflected; that is,
absolute goodness and wisdom.
<p>Hermes:
<p>O Asclepios, Will is the result of reflection, and to will is itself
an act of willing. For He Who is the fulness of all things and Who possesses
all that He will, wills nothing by caprice. But everything He wills is
good, and He has all that He wills; all that is good He thinks and wills.
Such is God, and the World is the image of His righteousness.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Is the world then good, O Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Yes, the world is good, Asclepios, as I will inform thee. Even as God
accords to all beings and to all orders in the world benefits of divers
kinds, such as thought, soul, and life, so likewise the world itself divides
and distributes good things among mortals, changing seasons, the fruits
of the earth, birth, increase, maturity, and other similar gifts. And thus
God is above the summit of heaven, yet everywhere present and beholding
all things. For beyond the heavens is a sphere without stars, transcending
all corporeal things. Between heaven and earth he reigns who is the dispenser
of life, and whom we call Zeus (Jupiter). Over the earth and the sea he
reigns who nourishes all mortal creatures, the plants and fruit-bearing
trees, and whose name is Zeus Sarapis (Jupiter Plutonius). And those to
whom it shall be given to dominate the earth shall be sent forth and established
at the extremity of Egypt, in a city built towards the west, whither, by
sea and by land, shall flow all the race of mortals.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>But where are they now, Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>They are established in a great city, upon the mountain of Lybia. Enough
of this. [1]

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Hermes:
<p>LET us speak now of that which is immortal and of that which is mortal.
The multitude, ignorant of the reason of things, is troubled by the approach
and the fear of death. Death occurs by the dissolution of the body, wearied
with its toil. When the number which maintains unity is complete --- for
the binding-power of the body is a number --- the body dies. And this happens
when it can no longer support the burdens of life. Such, then, is death;
the dissolution of the body, and the end of corporeal sensations. It is
superfluous to trouble oneself about such a matter. But there remains another
necessary law which human ignorance and unbelief despise.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>What law is this which is thus ignored or unregarded?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Hearken, O Asclepios. When the soul is separated from the body, she
passes under the supreme power of Deity, to be judged according to her
merits. If found pious and just she is allowed to dwell in the divine abodes,
but if she appears defiled with vice she is precipitated from height to
depth, and delivered over to the tempests and adverse hurricanes of the
air, the fire, and the water. Ceaselessly tossed about between heaven and
earth by the billows of the universe, she is driven from side to side in
eternal penance, her immortal nature gives endless duration to the judgment
pronounced against her. 1 How greatly must we fear so dreadful a fate!
They who now refuse to believe in such things will then be convinced against
their will, not by words, but by beholding; not by menaces, but by the
pains they will endure.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>The faults of men, O Trismegistos, are not then punished only by human
laws?
<p>Hermes:
<p>O Asclepios, all that is terrestrial is mortal. Those who live according
to the corporeal state, and who fall short during their life of the laws
imposed on this condition, are subjected after death to chastisement so
much the more severe as the faults committed by them have remained hidden;
for the universal prescience of God will render the punishment proportional
to the transgression. 2
<p>Asclepios:
<p>Who are they who deserve the greatest penalties, O Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Those who, condemned by human laws, die a violent death, in such wise
that they appear not to have paid the debt they owe to Nature, but to have
received only the reward of their actions. 1 The just man, on the contrary,
finds in religion and in piety a great help, and God protects him against
all evils. The Father and Lord of all things, Who alone is all, manifests
Himself willingly to all; not that He shows any man His abode, nor His
splendour, nor His greatness, but He enlightens man by intelligence alone,
whereby the darkness of error is dissipated, and the glories of the truth
revealed. By such means man is united to the Divine Intelligence; aspiring
thither he is delivered from the mortal part of his nature, and conceives
the hope of everlasting life. Herein is the difference between the good
and the wicked. He who is illumined by piety, religion, wisdom, the service
and veneration of God, sees, as with open eyes, the true reason of things;
and, through the confidence of this faith, surpasses other men even as
the sun the other fires of heaven. For if the sun enlightens the rest of
the stars, it is not so much by his greatness and power as by his divinity
and sanctity. Thou must see in him, O Asclepios, a secondary God, who rules
the rest of the world, and illumines all its inhabitants, animate and inanimate.
<p>If the world is an animated being which is, which has been, and which
will be always living, nothing in it is mortal. Each of its parts is alive,
for in a single creature always living there is no room for death. Thus
is God the plenitude of life and of eternity, for He necessarily lives
eternally; the sun is lasting as the universe, and governs perpetually
all living creatures, being the fount and distributor of all vitality.
God is, then, the ever-lasting Ruler of all things which receive life,
and of all that give it, the eternal dispenser of the being of the universe.
Now, He has once for all bestowed life on all living creatures by an immutable
law which I will expound to thee. The movement of the universe is the life
of eternity; the sphere of this motion is the eternity of life. The universe
will never cease from movement, nor will it ever become corrupt; the permanence
of eternal life surrounds it and protects it as a rampart. It dispenses
life to all that is in its bosom; it is the bond of all things ordained
under the sun. The effect of its motion is double; it is vivified by the
eternity which encompasses it, and, in its turn, it vivifies all that it
contains, diversifying everything according to certain fixed and determined
numbers and seasons. All things are ordained in time by the action of the
sun and the stars, according to a Divine law. Terrestrial periods are distinguished
by the condition of the atmosphere, by the alternatives of heat and cold;
celestial periods by the revolutions of the constellations, which return
at fixed intervals of time to the same places in the heavens. The universe
is the stage of time, the course and movement of which maintain Life. Order
and time produce the renewal of all things in the world by recurring seasons.

<p>77: [1] This passage resembles a fragment of Empedocles, cited by Plutarch:--"The
etherial force pursues them towards the sea, the sea vomits them forth
upon its shores, the earth in turn flings them upward to the untiring sun,
and the sun again drives them back into the whirl-wind of space. Thus all
the elements toss them from one to another, and all hold them in horror."
[It is needless to add that the whole of this passage is allegorical, and
that the penance referred to is that of Purgatory, or Kama Loka--the intermediate
state of purification.]
<p>77: [2] This passage qualifies the previous statement in Sect. IX.,
concerning the duration of the purgatorial state, and shows that it is
not --- p. 78, to be regarded as eternal, but as proportional to the faults
committed. Moreover, it supplies a reason for the Catholic custom of shriving
the dying, seeing that unconfessed sin entails heavier penalty than sin
confessed, and therefore no longer "hidden."
<p>78:[1] An obscure passage. Probably its meaning is that great sinners,
cut off by violent means in the midst of their iniquity, have no time to
work out their penance in life, and, being thus deprived of the opportunity
of restitution and amendment, suffer the more acutely in purgatory. For
since they cannot discharge their debt on earth, they are delivered to
torment after death until the "uttermost farthing" is paid. --- a.k.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>SINCE such is the state of the universe, there is nothing immutable,
nothing stable, nothing unchanging in nature, either in the heavens or
on the earth. God alone, and rightly alone, is wholly full and perfect
in Himself, of Himself, and around Himself. He is His own firm stability,
nor can He be moved by any impulsion, since all things are in Him, and
He alone is all. Unless, indeed, we should dare to say, that His movement
is in eternity, but this eternity itself is motionless, since all the motion
of time revolves in eternity and takes its form therein. God, then, has
ever been and is for ever immutable; with Him likewise is the immutable
eternity, bearing within it, as the image of God, the uncreated universe
not yet manifest. Hence, the created universe constitutes the imitation
of this eternal universe. Time, despite its perpetual movement, possesses,
by means of its necessary revolutions on itself, the force and nature of
stability. Thus, although eternity is fixed and immutable, nevertheless,
since the motion of time unfolds itself in eternity, and this mobility
is the very condition of time, it appears that eternity, immutable in itself,
yet revolves by means of the time which is within it, and which contains
all motion. Thence it results that the stability of eternity appears mobile,
and the mobility of time, stable, by the fixed law of their course. And
thus it might seem even that God moves in His own immutability. For there
is in the immensity of the equilibrium an unchangeable movement; the law
of His immensity is unchangeable.
<p>That, therefore, which is not subject to sense --- the Infinite, the
Incomprehensible, the Immeasureable--can not be sustained, nor carried,
nor sought out; neither can we know whence it comes, whither it goes, where
it is, how it is, nor what it is. It is contained in its own supreme stability,
and its stability in it; whether God be in eternity, or eternity in God,
or both one and the other in the two. Eternity is undefinable by time;
and time, which may be defined by number, by alternative, or by periodical
revolutions, is eternal. Thus both appear equally infinite and eternal.
Stability being the fixed point which serves as the basis of Movement,
must, because of this stability, hold the principal place. God and Eternity
are, therefore, the principle of all things; but the world, which is mutable,
cannot be considered the principle. The mutability of the world takes precedence
of its stability, by means of the law of eternal movement in equilibrium.
The whole consciousness of Divinity is then immutable, and moves only in
equilibrium; it is holy, incorruptible, eternal; or to define it better,
it is eternity, consisting in the very truth of the Supreme God, the plenitude
of all feeling and knowledge, or indeed, so to speak, in God Himself. The
consciousness of the natural universe includes all sensible things and
species; the consciousness of humanity involves memory, by which man remembers
his acts performed.
<p>Now, the consciousness of Divinity descends even to the human creature.
God has not seen fit to extend to all beings this supreme and divine consciousness,
lest, were it common to all animals, the glory of it should be diminished.
The intelligence of the human mind, --- whatever may be its quality and
quantity,--lies wholly in the memory, and it is by means of this tenacity
of memory that man has become the lord of the earth. The intelligence of
nature, the quality and consciousness of the universe, may be understood
by means of the sensible things it contains. Eternity, in the next place,
is understood as to its consciousness and its quality, according to the
sensible world.
<p>But the intelligence of the Divine Being, the consciousness of the Supreme
God, is the only truth, and this truth cannot be discovered,--no, nor so
much as its shadow,--in this world full of illusion, of changeful appearances,
and of error, where things are known only in the dimension of time.
<p>Thou seest, O Asclepios, what lofty matters we dare to treat! I thank
Thee, O most high God, Who hast illumined me with the light of Thy Grace!
As for you, O Tat, Asclepios, and Ammon, keep these Divine mysteries in
the secret place of your hearts, and conceal them in silence. Intellect
differs from perception in this --- that intellect, by means of study,
is competent to understand and to know the nature of the universe.
<p>The intellect of the universe penetrates to the consciousness of eternity,
and of the super-mundane Gods. And as for us who are men, we perceive heavenly
things as it were darkly through a mist, for thus only does the condition
of our human sense permit us to behold them. Feeble, indeed, is our strength
to penetrate things so Divine; but, when at last we attain to them, we
are indeed blessed by the joy of our inward consciousness.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>CONCERNING the Void, to which so much importance is attached, my judgment
is that it does not exist, that it never has existed, and that it never
will exist. For all the various parts of the universe are filled, as the
earth also is complete and full of bodies, differing in quality and in
form, having their species and their magnitude, one larger, one smaller,
one solid, one tenuous. The larger and more solid are easily perceived;
the smaller and more tenuous are difficult to apprehend, or altogether
invisible. We know only of their existence by the sensation of feeling,
wherefore many persons deny such entities to be bodies, and regard them
as simply spaces, but it is impossible there should be such spaces. For
if indeed there should be anything outside the universe, which I do not
believe, then it would be a space occupied by intelligible beings analogous
to its Divinity, in such wise that the world, which we call the sensible
world, would be filled with bodies and creatures appropriate to its nature
and quality. We do not behold all the aspects of the world; some of these
indeed are very vast, others very small, or else they appear small to us
by reason of their remoteness, or the imperfection of our sight; their
extreme tenuity may even cause us to be wholly ignorant of their existence.
I speak of the genii, for I hold they dwell with us, and of the heroes
who dwell above us, between the earth and the higher airs; wherein are
neither clouds nor any tempest.
<p>For in truth, O Asclepios, it cannot be said that there is anywhere
a void, unless care be taken to define what is signified by void; as, for
instance, void of fire, or water, or of some other such thing. And even
if this or that space, small or great, be empty of these elements, nothing
can be empty of the spirit and aerial fluid. The same thing may be said
of place; this word alone cannot be understood, unless it is applied to
something. By omitting the chief term, the sense intended is lost; thus,
it is correct to say, "the place of water," "the place of fire," or of
any other similar thing. For as it is impossible that there should be space
void of everything, so also it is impossible there should be place by itself.
If a place is supposed without its contents, then it is an empty place,
and, in my judgment, such a place does not exist in the universe. But if
nothing be void, then there can be no such thing as place in itself, unless
it be qualified by length, breadth, and depth, even as human bodies have
distinguishing signs.
<p>If, then, these things be so, O Asclepios and you who are also present,
know that the Intelligible World, that is to say, God, Who is perceived
only by the eye of intelligence, is incorporeal, and that nothing corporeal
can be mingled with His nature, nor anything that can be defined by quality,
quantity, or numeration, for there is nothing of such a kind in Him. This
world, which is called the sensible world, is the receptacle of all sensible
appearances, qualities, and bodies, nor can this universe exist without
God. For God is all, and all come forth from Him, and depend on His Will;
He contains everything that is good, orderly, wise, perfect, perceptible
for Him alone, and intelligible for Him alone. Apart from Him nothing has
been, nothing is, nothing will be; for all proceed from Him, are in Him,
and by Him; whether manifold qualities, vast quantities, magnitudes exceeding
measurement, species of all forms. If thou understandest these things,
Asclepios, render thanks to God; and, observing the universe, comprehend
clearly that this sensible world, and all that it contains, is enfolded,
as in a garment, by the supernal world. O Asclepios, beings of every kind,
whether mortals, immortals, reasonable, animate, inanimate, to whatever
class they may belong, bear the impress of that class, and although each
of them has the general appearance of its kind, there are yet among them
special differences. Even so, the human kind is uniform, and man may be
defined by his type; nevertheless, under this general likeness, men present
many dissimilarities. For the character which proceeds from God is incorporeal,
as is all that is comprehended in intelligence. Since the two principles
which determine form are corporeal and incorporeal, it is impossible that
they should generate a form wholly resembling something else, at whatever
distance of time or of place. Forms, nevertheless, are as changeful as
the moments in an hour's space, in the moveable circle wherein is that
omniform God of whom we have spoken. Therefore the type persists, producing
as many images of itself as the revolution of the world has instants of
time. The world has changes in its revolution, but species (individuality)
has neither period nor change. Thus the forms of every species are permanent,
and yet various in the same species.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>And does the world also vary in its species, Trismegistos?
<p>Hermes:
<p>Why then, Asclepios, hast thou been asleep all the while we have been
discoursing? What is the world, or of what is it composed, if not of all
that is generated in it? Or dost thou speak of heaven, of the earth, and
of the elements, for other beings continually change in appearance? But
even so the heaven, now rainy, now dry, now hot, now cold, now clear, now
covered with clouds, has many successive changes of aspect beneath its
apparent uniformity. So also the earth constantly changes its aspect, for
now it brings forth its fruits, now it hides them in its bosom, bearing
products of diverse quality and quantity; here is repose, there is movement,
and every variety of trees, flowers, seeds, properties, odours, savours,
forms. Fire, likewise, has its manifold and divine transformations, for
the sun and the moon have all manner of aspects comparable to the multitude
of images beheld in mirrors. And now we have discoursed enough of these
things.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>LET us return to man, and enquire concerning the divine gift of reason
which entitles him to be called a reasonable creature. Among all the wonders
we have noted in man, that which above all commands admiration is this:
--- that man has discovered the divinity of nature, and has made it efficient
to his designs. [1]
<p>Our ancestors, wandering astray in matters of faith concerning the Gods,
and unable to lift their minds to the Divine knowledge and religion, discovered
the art of making Gods; and, having discovered it, they invested their
products with appropriate virtues drawn from the nature of the world. And,
as they could not make souls, they evoked the spirits of genii and angels,
and endowed with them the holy images and sacraments, thus enabling their
idols to exercise powers for good or ill. In such wise thine ancestor,
O Asclepios, the inventor of medicine, has a temple on the Lybian mountain
by the shores of the crocodile-frequented river, where also lies enshrined
all of him which belonged to the earth --- that is, his body. For the rest
of him--his better part, or rather, indeed, himself --- because the principle
of consciousness and of life is the whole man--is restored to heaven. And
now, by his divinity, he lends help to men in their sicknesses, who once
instructed them in the art of healing. So also, Hermes, my own ancestor,
whose name I bear, now enshrined in the country which is called after him,
hears the prayers of those who come thither from all parts of the land
to obtain of him assistance and health. Behold, again, what blessings Isis,
the spouse of Osiris, confers upon men when she is favourable to them,
and what ills she inflicts when she is angered! For these mundane and earthly
Gods are accessible to wrath, being formed and composed by men out of Nature.
Of, such sort in Egypt is the adoration paid to animals; and thus also
do cities honour the souls of those men who, in their lifetime, gave them
laws and whose names they preserve. And for this reason, O Asclepios, those
deities which are adored in some places, receive in others no worship;
whence arise many wars between the cities of Egypt.
<p>Asclepios:
<p>And of what kind, O Trismegistos, is the divinity of these Gods who
inhabit the earth?
<p>Hermes:
<p>It consists in the divine virtue, which naturally subsists in herbs,
rocks, and aromatic principles, wherefore these deities love frequent sacrifices,
hymns, and praises, and sweet music resembling the celestial harmony, which
heaven-like rite, attractive to their sacred nature, draws them and retains
them in their shrines, so that they patiently endure their long sojourn
among men. It is thus that men make Gods. Neither must thou suppose, O
Asclepios, that the acts of these terrestrial deities are controlled by
hazard. For while the supernal Gods abide in the heights of heaven, keeping
each the order which belongs to him, these Gods of ours have also their
special functions. Some predict by means of lots and divination the events
of the future; others preside, in various ways, over things depending on
their care, or come to our assistance as allies, as kinsmen, or as friends.
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>87: [1] This section continues and elucidates the argument of section
IX. An acquaintance with occult doctrine regarding the Nature-spirits,
or mundane Gods, will, I think, enable the reader to follow intelligently
the observations of Hermes in regard to the sacred images. Precisely the
same virtues as those attributed by the ancients to the idols of their
various deities, are in our day attributed by Catholics to the idols of
their saints. We hear of the "Virgin" of this or that town being propitious
to a petition which the "Virgin" of some other place has refused to grant.
Sacred images still heal the sick, avert pestilences, discover hidden springs,
and confer blessings upon devotees. --- p. 88, Hermes points out that the
powers by which these things are accomplished belong to the divinity of
Nature, individualised and differentiated by human intervention; and that
mankind necessarily passes through the stage of nature-worship before becoming
competent to realise the celestial order and the being of the heavenly
Gods. For before the empyrean can be reached by the human intelligence,
it must traverse the spheres intermediate between earth and heaven. Thus
the images of the Gods are worshipped before the Gods themselves are known;
nor are these images necessarily of wood or stone. All personalities are
eidola (idols) reflecting the true essentials, and having, as it were,
a portion of Divinity attached to them and resident in their forms, but
none the less are they images, and however powerful and adorable they may
appear to the multitude who know not divine religion, they are to the Hermetist
but types and persona of essentials which are eternally independent of
manifestation and unaffected by it. The signs of the truly Divine are three:
transcendency of form, transcendency of time, transcendency of personality.
Instead of form is Essence; instead of time, Eternity; instead of persons,
Principles. Events become Processes, and phenomena, Noumena. So long as
the conception of any divine idea remains associated with, or dependent
on, any physical or historical circumstance, so long it is certain that
the heavenly plane has not been reached. Symbols, when they are recognised
as symbols, are no longer either deceptive or dangerous; they are merely
veils of light rendering visible the "Divine Dark," towards which the true
Hermetist aspires. Even the most refined, the subtlest and most metaphysical
expression of the supreme Truth is still symbol and metaphor, for the Truth
itself is unutterable, save by God to God. It is Essence, Silence, Darkness.

<p><b>PART XIV.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Asclepios:
<p>O TRISMEGISTOS, what is the part taken in the order of things by Destiny
or Fate? If the heavenly Gods rule the universe, and the mundane deities
control special events, where is the part of Destiny?
<p>Hermes:
<p>O Asclepios, Destiny is the necessity which compels all things that
happen, the chain which binds together all events. It is thus the cause
of things, the supreme deity, or rather the second God created by God,
that is the law of all things in heaven and earth established upon divine
ordinances. Destiny and Necessity are bound together indissolubly: Destiny
produces the beginning of all things, Necessity enforces the effect which
ensues from these beginnings. And hence arises Order --- that is, the sequence
and disposition of things accomplished in Time; for nothing is performed
without Order. And thus the world is perfected; for the world is founded
on Order, and in Order the universe consists. Therefore these three, Destiny
(which is Fate), Necessity, and Order, depend absolutely on the will of
God Who governs the world by His divine law and reason. These three principles
have no will in themselves; inflexible and inaccessible to favour as to
anger, they are but the instruments of the eternal Reason, which is immutable,
invariable, unalterable, indissoluble. First comes Destiny, containing,
like newly-sown soil, the germs of future events. Necessity follows, urging
them to their consummation. Lastly, Order maintains the fabric of things
established by Destiny and Necessity. For all this is an ever-lasting sequence
without beginning or end, sustained by its immutable law in the continuity
of eternity. It rises and falls alternately, and as time rolls onward,
that which had disappeared, again rises uppermost. For such is the condition
of the circular movement; all things are interchained in such wise that
neither beginning nor end can be distinguished, and they appear to precede
and follow each other unceasingly. But as for accident and chance, they
pervade all mundane affairs.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>AND now, inasmuch as it is given to man, and inasmuch as God has permitted,
we have spoken concerning everything; it remains only, therefore, that
we should bless and pray to God and return to our mortal cares, having
satisfied our minds by treating of sacred things which are the food of
the mind.
<p>Therewith, coming forth from the Sanctuary, they addressed to God their
oraisons, turning themselves to the south, because when the sun begins
to decline, he who would praise the God should direct his gaze thither,
as in like manner, at sunrise, he should look towards the orient. And even
while they pronounced their invocations, Asclepios, in a low voice, spoke
thus:
<p>O Tatius, let us ask our father that our prayers may be accompanied
with odours of incense and perfumes.
<p>Trismegistos heard, and was moved.
<p>May the omen be favourable, O Asclepios, he said. It is almost a sacrilege
to burn incense or any other perfume during prayer; He Who is all and Who
contains all, desires nothing. Let us give Him praise and adoration only;
the divinest odours are acts of grace which mortals render to God.
<p>We give Thee thanks, O Lord Most High, for by Thy grace we have received
the light of Thy knowledge; may Thy Name be adored and venerated, only
Name by which Deity is praised according to the religion of our fathers!
For Thou dost vouchsafe to accord to all of us the ancestral faith, piety,
love, and the most worthy and gracious gifts, in that Thou bestowest upon
us consciousness, reason, and intelligence. By consciousness we discern
Thee, by reason we seek Thee, and intelligence endows us with the joy of
understanding Thee. Saved by Thy divine power, let us be glad in beholding
the manifestation of Thyself; let us be glad that, from the hour of our
sojourn in the body, Thou dost deign to consecrate us to eternity. The
only joy of Man is the knowledge of Thy majesty. We have known Thee, O
magnificent Light, who art apprehended by Intelligence alone! We have known
Thee, O true Way of Life, inexhaustible Source of all births! We have known
Thee, O generative Plenitude of all Nature, Eternal Permanence! And in
this our oraison, adoring the sanctity of Thy holiness, we ask of Thee
only to grant that we may persevere in the love of Thy knowledge, in such
wise that we may never separate ourselves from this manner of life. With
which hope being filled, we go forth to take a pure repast without animal
flesh. 1

<p><i>End of the Treatise on Initiations</i></center>

<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>94: [1 ]The words with which this Discourse on Initiation ends are full
of significance. The key to the Hermetic Secret is found when the aspirant
adopts the Edenic Life: the life of purity and charity which all mystics
--- Hebrew, Egyptian, Buddhist, Greek, Latin, Vedic, with one consent,
ascribe to man in the golden age of his primeval perfection. The first
outcome of the Fall, or Degeneracy, is the shedding of blood and eating
of flesh. The license to kill is the sign-manual of "Paradise Lost." And
the first step towards "Paradise Regained" is taken when man voluntarily
returns to the manner of life indicated by his organism as that alone befitting
him, and thus reunites himself to the harmony of Nature and the Will of
God. No man who follows this path and faithfully keeps to it will fail
to find at length the Gate of Paradise. Not necessarily in a single life-time,
for the process of purification is a long one, and the past experiences
of some men may be such as to shut them out for many lives from the attainment
of the promised land. But, nevertheless, every step faithfully and firmly
trodden, brings them nearer to the goal, every year of pure life increasingly
strengthens the spirit, purges the mind, liberates the will, and augments
their human royalty. On the other hand, it is idle to seek union with God
in the Spirit, while the physical and magnetic organism remains insurgent
against Nature. Harmony must be established between man and Nature before
union can be accomplished between man and God. For Nature is the manifest
God; and if man be not in perfect charity with that which is visible, how
shall he love that which is invisible? Hermetic doctrine teaches the kinship
and solidarity of all beings, redeemed and glorified in man. For man does
not stand aloof and apart from other creatures, as though he were a fallen
angel dropped from some supernal world upon the earth, but he is the child
of earth, the product of evolution, the elder brother of all conscient
things; their lord and king, but not their tyrant. It is his part to be
to all creatures a Good Destiny; he is the keeper, the redeemer, the regenerator
of the earth. If need be, he may call on his subjects to serve him as their
king, but he may never, without forfeiting his kingship, maltreat and afflict
them. All the children of God, in every land and age, have abstained from
blood, in obedience to an occult law which asserts itself in the breast
of all regenerate men. The mundane Gods are not averse to blood, for by
means of it they are invigorated and enabled to manifest. For the mundane
Gods are the forces of the astral element in man, which element dominates
in the unregenerate. Therefore, the unregenerate are under the power of
the stars, and subject to illusion. Inasmuch as a man is clean from the
defilement of blood, insomuch he is less liable to be beguiled by the deceptions
of the astral serpent. Therefore, let all who seek the Hermetic secret,
do their utmost to attain to the Hermetic life. If entire abstinence from
all forms of animal food be impossible, let a lower degree be adopted,
admitting the use of the least bloody meats only--milk, fish, eggs, and
the flesh of birds. But in such a case, let the intention of the aspirant
be continually united with that of Nature, willing with firm desire to
lead, whenever possible, a yet more perfect life; so that in a future birth
he may be enabled to attain to it. --- A.K.

<p><b>PART I.</b>
<p><img SRC="definitn.jpg" height=494 width=274></center>

<p>Asclepios to the King Ammon.
<p>I ADDRESS to thee, O King, a comprehensive discourse, 1 which is, as
it were, the sum and epitome of all others. Far from being in accordance
with the opinion of the vulgar, it is wholly adverse thereto. Even to thee,
it may seem inconsistent with certain of my discourses. My master, Hermes,
who frequently conversed with me, either alone, or in the presence of Tatios,
was wont to say that those who should read my writings would affirm their
doctrine to be quite simple and clear, while indeed, on the contrary, it
is truly occult and contains a hidden sense. And it has become yet more
obscure since the Greeks undertook to translate it from our language into
theirs. This has been a source of difficulty and perversion of sense. The
character of the Egyptian language, and the energy of the words it uses,
enforce the meaning on the mind. As much then as thou canst, O King, and
indeed thou art all-powerful, prevent this discourse from being translated,
lest these mysteries should reach the Greeks, and their manner of speech,
adorned and elegant in expression, should, perchance, weaken the vigour
and diminish the solemn gravity and force of these words. The Greeks, O
King, have new forms of language for producing argument, and their philosophy
is prodigal of speech. We, on the other hand, employ not words so much
as the great language of facts.
<p>I will begin this discourse by invoking God, the Master of the Universe,
the Creator and the Father, Who contains all, Who is All in One, and One
in All. For the plenitude of all things is Unity, and in Unity; nor is
the one term inferior to the other, since the two are one. Bear in mind
this thought, O King, during the whole of my exposition. Vain is it to
seek to distinguish the All and the One by designating the multitude of
things the All, and not their Plenitude. Such a distinction is impossible,
for the All exists no longer if separated from Unity; and if Unity exists,
it is in the Totality; now it indeed exists and never ceases to be One,
otherwise the Plenitude would be dissolved.
<p>In the bosom of the earth there are impetuous springs of water and of
fire; such are the three natures of fire, water, and earth, proceeding
from a common origin. Whereby it may be thought that there is one general
fountain of matter, bringing forth all abundantly and receiving existence
from on high. It is thus that heaven and earth are governed by their creator,
that is, by the sun, who causes essence to stream downwards, and matter
to rise upwards, and who draws to himself the universe, giving all to everything,
lavish of the benefits of his radiance. It is he who distributes beneficent
energies not only in heaven and throughout the air, but upon earth also,
and even in the depths of the abyss. If there be an intelligible substance,
it must be the very substance of the sun, whose light is the vehicle thereof.
But what may be its constitution and primal fount, he only knows. That
by induction we may understand that which is hidden from our sight, it
would be necessary to be near him and analogous to his nature. But that
which he permits us to behold is no conjecture; it is the splendid vision
which illuminates the universal and supernal world.
<p>In the midst of the universe is the sun established, like the bearer
of the crowns; and even as a skilful driver, he directs and maintains the
chariot of the world, holding it to its course. He keeps fast the reins
of it, even life, soul, spirit, immortality, and birth. He drives it before
him, or, rather, with him. And after this manner he forms all things, dispensing
to immortals eternal permanence. The light, which from his outer part streams
towards heaven, nourishes the immortal spaces of the universe. The rest,
encircling and illuminating the entirety of the waters, the earth, and
the air, becomes the matrix wherein life germinates, wherein are initiated
all births and metamorphoses, transforming creatures, as by a spiral motion,
and causing them to pass from one portion of the world to another, from
one species to another, and from one appearance to another; maintaining
the equilibrium of their mutual metamorphoses, as in the creation of greater
entities. For the permanence of bodies consists in transmutation. But immortal
forms are indissoluble, and mortal bodies decompose; such is the difference
between the immortal and the mortal.
<p>This creation of life by the sun is as continuous as his light; nothing
arrests or limits it. Around him, like an army of satellites, are innumerable
choirs of Genii. These dwell in the neighbourhood of the Immortals, and
thence watch over human things. They fulfil the will of the Gods by means
of storms, tempests, transitions of fire, and earthquakes; likewise by
famines and wars, for the punishment of impiety. For the greatest crime
of men is impiety towards the Gods. The nature of the Gods is to do good,
the duty of men is to be pious, the function of the Genii is to chastise.
The Gods do not hold men responsible for faults committed through mistake
or boldness, by that necessity which belongs to fate, or by ignorance;
only iniquity falls under the weight of their justice.
<p>It is the sun who preserves and nourishes all creatures; and even as
the Ideal World which environs the sensible world fills this last with
the plenitude and universal variety of forms, so also the sun enfolding
all in his light accomplishes everywhere the birth and development of creatures,
and when they fall wearied in the race, gathers them again to his bosom.
Under his orders is the choir of the Genii, or rather the choirs, for there
are many and diverse, and their number corresponds to that of the stars.
Every star has its genii, good and evil by nature, or rather by their operation,
for operation is the essence of the genii. In some there is both good and
evil operation. All these Genii preside over mundane affairs, they shake
and overthrow the constitution of States and of individuals; they imprint
their likeness on our souls, they are present in our nerves, our marrow,
our veins, our arteries, and our very brain-substance, and in the recesses
of our viscera. At the moment when each of us receives life and being,
he is taken in charge by the genii who preside over births, and who are
classed beneath the astral powers. Perpetually they change, not always
identical, but revolving in circles. They permeate by the body two parts
of the soul, that it may receive from each the impress of his own energy.
But the reasonable part of the soul is not subject to the genii; it is
designed for the reception of God, who enlightens it with a sunny ray.
Those who are thus illumined are few in number, and from them the genii
abstain; for neither genii nor gods have any power in the presence of a
single ray of God. But all other men, both soul and body, are directed
by genii, to whom they cleave, and whose operations they affect. But reason
is not like desire, which deceives and misleads. The genii, then, have
the control of mundane things, and our bodies serve them as instruments.
Now, it is this control which Hermes calls Destiny. [1]
<p>The Intelligible World is attached to God, the Sensible World to the
Intelligible World, and through these two worlds, the sun conducts the
effluence of God, that is, the creative energy. Around him are the eight
spheres which are bound to him --- the sphere of the fixed stars, the six
spheres of the planets, and that which surrounds the earth. To these spheres
the genii are bound, and to the genii, men; and thus are all beings bound
to God, who is the universal Father. The sun is the creator; the world
is the crucible of creation. The Intelligible Essence rules heaven, heaven
directs the gods, under these are classed the genii, who guide mankind.
Such is the divine hierarchy, and such is the operation which God accomplishes
by gods and genii for Himself. Everything is a part of God, thus God is
all. In creating all, He perpetuates Himself without any intermission,
for the energy of God has no past, and since God is without limits, His
creation is without beginning or end. [2]

<p>106: [1] Asclepios, throughout this discourse, preaches pure Hermetic
doctrine, which discourages all traffic with elementals, astrals, and other
d&aelig;monic influences, whether beneficent or the reverse, and instructs
man rather to seek the grace of the Holy Spirit, by aspiring evermore inwards
and upwards, and abiding in the reasonable and divine part of his nature.

or Mount of Energies, emits a continuous river of Generation, or "Becoming."
And the equilibrium of Nature is continually maintained by a corresponding
process of perpetual return from Matter to p. 107 Essence; from Existence
to Being. With the right hand ADONAI projects; with the left He indraws.

<p>IF thou reflectest, O King, thou wilt perceive that there are incorporeal
corporealites. Which are they? says the King. Corporealites which appear
in mirrors; are they not incorporeal?
<p>It is true, Tat, says the King; thou hast a marvellous fancy!
<p>There are yet other incorporealities; for instance, abstract forms,
what say you to them? Are they not in themselves incorporeal? yet they
are manifest in animated and inanimated corporealities.
<p>True again, Tat.
<p>So then there is a reflexion of incorporealities upon corporealities,
and of corporealities on incorporealities. In other words, the Sensible
World and the Ideal World reflect each other. Adore, then, the sacred images,
O King, for they also are reflective forms of the Sensible World.

<p><b>PART III.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>WHEN a musician, desiring to conduct a melody, is hindered in his design
by the want of accord in the instruments employed, his efforts end in ridicule,
and provoke the laughter of the auditors. In vain he expends the resources
of his art, or accuses of falseness the instrument which reduces him to
impotence.
<p>The great musician of Nature, the God who presides over the harmony
of song, and who controls the resonance of the instruments according to
the rhythm of the melody, is unwearying, for weariness reaches not the
gods. And if an artist conducts a concert of music, and the trumpeters
blow according to their ability, the flute-players express the delicate
modulations of the melody, and the lyre and violin accompany the song,
who would think of accusing the inspiration of the composer, or withhold
from him the esteem his work deserves, if some instrument should trouble
the melody with discord and hinder the auditors from seizing its purity?
Even so, not without impiety can we impeach Humanity, on account of the
impotence of our own body. For know that God is an Artist of untiring Spirit,
always Master of His science, always successful in His operations, and
everywhere bestowing equal benefits. If Phidias, the creative artisan,
should find the material on which it is necessary for him to work, refractory
to his skill, let us not blame him who has laboured to the utmost of his
power; neither let us accuse the musician of the faults of the instrument,
but rather complain of the defective chord, which, by lowering or raising
a note, has destroyed the concord; and the worse this is, the more does
he merit praise who succeeds in drawing from such a chord an accurate tone.
Far from reproaching him, the auditors will be all the better pleased with
him. It is thus, O most illustrious hearers, that our inward lyre must
be attuned to the intention of the musician.
<p>I can even imagine that a musician, deprived of the aid of his lyre,
and being called upon to produce some great musical effect, might, by untried
means, supply the place of the accustomed instrument, and arouse thereby
the enthusiasm of his auditors. It is related of a cithara player, to whom
Apollo was favourable, that, being once suddenly checked in his performance
of a melody by the snapping of a string, the kindness of the God supplied
the want and magnified the talent of the artist; for by providential help,
a cicada interposed his song and executed the missing notes which the broken
cord should have sounded. The musician, reassured, and no more troubled
by the accident, obtained a triumph. I feel in myself, O most noble hearers,
something similar; for, but now, being convinced of my incapacity and weakness,
the power of the Supreme Being has supplied in my stead the melody wherewith
to praise the king. For the design of this discourse is to declare the
glory of royalties and their achievements. Forward, then! the musician
wills it, and for this the lyre is tuned! May the grandeur and sweetness
of the melody respond to the purpose of our song!
<p>And since we have tuned our lyre to hymn the praise of kings, and to
celebrate their renown, let us first praise the good God, the supreme King
of the universe. After Him we will glorify those who reflect His image,
and hold the sceptre of royalty. Kings themselves are glad that the song
should descend from above, degree after degree, that aspiration should
draw nigh to Heaven whence victory comes to them. Let, then, the singer
praise the mighty God of the universe, ever immortal, whose power is eternal
as Himself, the first of Victors, from Whom all triumphs come, succeeding
one another. Let us hasten to close our discourse, that we may offer praise
to kings, even to those who are the guardians of peace and of general security;
who hold from the Lord supreme their ancient power, and receive victory
from His hand; those whose sceptres shine resplendent to herald the hardships
of war, whose triumphs anticipate the conflict; and to whom it is given
not only to reign, but to overcome; whose very advance to battle strikes
the barbarian enemy with fear.

<br>
<p>THIS discourse ends where it began, with the praise of the Supreme Being,
and afterwards of the most holy kings by whom we obtain peace. So that
having commenced by celebrating the Almighty greatness, it is to this greatness
that we return in terminating our speech. Even as the sun nourishes all
germs, and receives the promise of the fruits which his rays, like divine
hands, gather for the God; even as these shining hands collect likewise
the sweet odours of plants, so also we, after having begun by the adoration
of the Most High and the effluence of His Wisdom, after having gathered
into our souls the fragrance of these heavenly flowers, must now collect
the sweetness of this sacred harvest which He, with fruitful rains, will
bless. But even if we had ten thousand mouths and ten thousand voices wherewith
to glorify the God of all purity, the Father of Souls, we should yet be
powerless to celebrate Him worthily; for new-born babes cannot, indeed,
rightly extol their father, yet since they do their utmost, they obtain
indulgence. Or rather, the glory of God is seen in this, that He is superior
to all creatures; He is the Beginning, He is the End, the Midst, and the
Continuance of their Praise; in Him they acknowledge their Parent, all-powerful
and infinite.
<p>It is the same also with our king. We, who are his children, love to
extol him; and we ask indulgence of our father, even when, before we asked,
it was granted to us. A father, far from turning away from his little ones,
and from his new-born infants, because of their feebleness, rejoices to
see himself recognised by them. The universal gnosis which communicates
life to all, and enables us to bless God, is itself a gift of God. For
God, being good, has in Himself the fulness of all perfection; being immortal,
He contains in Himself immortal tranquillity, and His eternal power sends
forth into this world a salutary benediction. In the hierarchy which He
contains there are no differences nor variations; all the beings in Him
are wise, the same providence is in all, the same intelligence governs
them, the same sentiment impels them to mutual goodness, and the same love
produces among them universal harmony.
<p>Therefore, let us bless God and after Him the kings who from Him receive
the sceptre. And having inaugurated the praises of the kings, let us also
glorify piety towards the Supreme. May He instruct us how to bless Him,
and may His aid assist us in this study. May our first and chief endeavour
be to celebrate the fear of God and the praise of the Kings. For to them
is due our gratitude for the fruitful peace which by their means we enjoy.
It is the virtue of the King, and his name only which obtains peace; he
is called King because he advances chief in royalty and power, and because
he reigns by reason and peace. He is above all barbarian royalties, his
very name is a symbol of peace. The name alone of the King suffices often
to repel the foe. His images are as beacons of safety in the tempest. For
the very image of our King procures victory, confers security, and renders
us invulnerable.
<p>[Patrizzi hesitates to ascribe the fragment entitled "Asclepios to King
Ammon" to the disciple of Hermes, thinking it unworthy of one who had enjoyed
the instructions of so great a man. Dr. Menard points out that despite
the tirade against the Greeks and the Greek tongue in the first section
of this fragment, it was undoubtedly originally written in that very language,
as is proved by the reference made in the third section to [Greek] (the
king), and the etymological derivation of the word from [Greek] (to advance),
and also by the allusions to Phidias, and to Eunomios, a musician of Locris,
in the second section. The description of the sun as a charioteer, and
the passing reference to "him who bears the crowns," are also both suggested
by Greek usages. In Egypt the sun was always represented as carried on
a barge or floating raft along the waters of the Nile. Dr. Menard inclines,
therefore, to believe that the depreciatory remarks concerning the Greeks
must have been introduced by a fraudulent hand, in order to mislead the
reader in regard to the true origin of the fragment. Dr. Menard is, moreover,
of opinion that the king, or kings spoken of in the fragment, are the imperial
brothers Valens and Valentinian. I venture to differ from this view, and
believe, rather, that the writer, whether indeed the true Asclepios or
not, certainly uses the words "king," "kings," and "royalties" in an occult
sense. For if he intended, as Dr. Menard supposes, a mere commonplace eulogium
on a reigning monarch or monarchs--whether Ammon, or Valens and his brother--to
what purpose should he set out by declaring his writings to be "truly occult
and containing a hidden sense"? All that is said in the fragment concerning
kingship is perfectly applicable to the mystic Osiris, the nature of whose
royalty has been elsewhere explained. Osiris is the reflection and counterpart
in Man, of the supreme Lord of the Universe, the ideal type of humanity;
hence the soul, or essential ego, presenting itself for judgment in the
spiritual world, is in the Egyptian Ritual of the Dead, described as "an
Osiris." It is to this Osiris, or king within us, our higher Reason, the
true Word of God, that we owe perpetual reverence, service, and faithful
allegiance. --- A.K.]

<p>Trismegistos.
<p>IT is for the love of men and for the veneration of God, O my son, that
I begin to write this. For there is no other true religion than to meditate
on the universe and give thanks to the Creator; and these things I shall
not cease to do.
<p>Tatios.
<p>O father, if nothing here below be real, how can one wisely employ one's
life?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Be religious, my son; religion is lofty philosophy; without philosophy
there is no lofty religion. He who instructs himself concerning the universe,
its law, its principle, and its end, gives thanks for all things to the
Creator as to a gracious father, a good protector, a faithful teacher.
This is religion, and by means of it we know where truth is and what it
is. Knowledge increases religion. For when once the soul, imprisoned within
the body, has lifted herself to the perception of the real Good and of
Truth, she cannot again fall back. The might of Love, and the oblivion
of all evil things, forbid the soul who knows her Maker to separate herself
from the Good. Herein, my son, is the aim of religion; if thou canst attain
thereunto, thy life will be pure, thy death happy; thy soul will know whither
she ought to direct her flight. Herein is the only way which leads to Truth,
which, indeed, our ancestors trod, and by which they arrived at the attainment
of the Good. This way is beautiful and even; nevertheless, it is difficult
for the soul to walk therein so long as she is immured within the prison
of the body. For, first, she must contend against herself, and having accomplished
a division of herself, she must submit to that part of herself which is
first in dignity. For the one struggles against the two, that would fain
rise, but these would drag it downwards. 1 Nor is victory the same to both
sides; for the one tends towards the Good, and the two towards Evil; the
one would be free, the two cling to servitude. If the two be overcome,
there remains a bulwark of defence for them and for their master; but if
the one be the weaker, it is drawn away by the two, and punished in this
life here below. It is this one, my son, which ought to be thy guide. See
that thou anoint thyself with oil for the struggle, maintain the fight
for life, and remain victorious.
<p>And now, my son, I am about to sum up our principles; thou wilt understand
my words by remembering that which thou hast learnt.
<p>All beings are endowed with motion; non-being alone is motionless. All
bodies transform themselves some only decompose. All creatures are not
mortal nor are all immortal. That which is dissoluble is corruptible; that
which is permanent is immutable; that which is immutable is eternal; that
which is continually generated is continually corrupted, but that which
is born but once is not corrupted and is not changed into any other thing.
First God, then the Universe, and thirdly Man; the Universe for Man, and
Man for God. The emotional part of the Soul is mortal; her rational part
is immortal; all substance is immortal, all substance is subjected to change.
All being is dual; no being is permanent. All things are not animated by
soul, but all that is being is animated by soul. All that is passive is
sentient; all that is sentient is transient. Everything that suffers and
enjoys is a mortal creature; all that enjoys and suffers not is a being
immortal. Not every body is subject to disease, but every body so subject
is destructible. In God is Intelligence; in Man is Reason. Reason is in
Intelligence, Intelligence is intransient. There is nothing real in the
corporeal; nothing false in the incorporeal. Everything that is born changes,
but not everything born corrupts. There is nothing perfect upon earth,
nor anything evil in heaven. God is perfect; man is evil. The good comes
by will; evil against will. The Gods chose the good as good. Time is divine;
law is human. Evil is the pabulum of the world; Time is the destruction
of man. All things in heaven are immutable; nothing is immutable on earth.
In heaven, then, is no servitude; on earth there is no freedom. Nothing
in heaven is unknown; on earth nothing is known. There is nothing in common
between celestial things and things terrestrial. All is irreproachable
in heaven; on earth nothing is without reproach. The immortal knows no
mortality; nor does the mortal know immortality. That which is sown does
not always come up; but that which comes up has always been sown. Corruptible
bodies have two periods of existence: from conception to birth, and from
birth to death; but the eternal entity has one period only from the moment
of being. Dissoluble bodies increase and diminish. Dissoluble matter divides
itself according to two contrary terms--destruction and birth; immortal
substance divides itself either into itself or into its similars. The birth
of man is a destruction; the destruction of man is an element of birth.
That which ends begins; that which begins ends. Among beings, some are
in bodies, some in forms, some in energies. The body is in forms; form
and energy are in bodies. The immortal receives nothing from the mortal;
but the mortal receives from the immortal. The mortal enters not into an
immortal form; but the immortal enters into a mortal body. Energies tend
not upward, but downward. That which is on earth profits not that which
is in heaven; but all that is in heaven profits that which is on earth.
Heaven contains immortal entities; earth contains perishable bodies. Earth
is irrational; heaven is reasonable. Celestial things are under the power
of heaven; terrestrial things are upon earth. Heaven is the primordial
element. Divine providence is order; necessity is the instrument with which
providence works. Fortuity is the vehicle of disorder, the false image
of energy, a delusive seeming. What is God but immutable Good, or man but
continual evil?
<p>In remembering these principles, thou wilt easily recollect the things
I have explained to thee more at length, and which are therein resumed.
But
avoid speaking of them to the multitude; not that I desire to prohibit
the multitude from knowing these things, but that I would not have thee
exposed to the mockeries of the vulgar. Like attracts like; but between
dissimilars there is no fellowship. These discourses ought to have but
a small number of auditors, else before long they will have none at all.
There is, moreover, a special peril attaching to them, for by means of
them the wicked may be instigated to do worse. Keep thyself, therefore,
from the crowd, which cannot understand the virtue of these discourses.
<p>Tatios.
<p>What meanest thou, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Hearken, my son. The human race is drawn to-wards evil. Evil is its
nature, and pleases it. If men should learn that the world is created,
that all is done according to providence and necessity, and that by necessity
and destiny all things are governed, they would readily begin to despise
all things because they are created; to attribute vice to destiny, and
to give the rein to all manner of iniquity. Therefore, abstain from the
crowd, so that by means of ignorance the vulgar may be kept within bounds,
even through fear of the unknown.
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>121: [1] With Plato, says Dr. Menard, Trismegistos here opposes Intelligence,
the first part of the Soul, to the two other parts, Passion and Desire.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Tatios.
<p>THOU hast well explained to me these things, my father, but instruct
me yet again concerning this. Thou hast told me that know-ledge and art
are activities of the reason; and now thou sayest that brute animals are
so called because they have no reason. Whence it must necessarily follow
that they have neither knowledge nor art.
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>It necessarily so follows, my son.
<p>Tatios.
<p>How then is it, father, that we behold certain animals making use of
scientific and constructive knowledge; as, for instance, the ants who store
up provisions for the winter, the birds who devise nests, the cattle who
know their stables and return thither?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>It is neither science nor art that directs them, my son, but nature.
Science and art are acquired, but these creatures have acquired nothing.
That which is naturally performed is the product of the universal activity;
science and art belong only to those who have acquired them. Functions
which are the common heritage are natural functions. Thus, all men can
make use of their eyes, but not all are musicians, archers, hunters, and
so forth. Some only among the many learn a science or an art, and exercise
it. If in like manner certain ants only did what other ants do not, then
thou mightest say with reason that they possess the science or the art
of storing provisions. But all act in the same way under the impulsion
of Nature and without deliberate intent; whence it is evident that neither
science nor art directs them.
<p>Activities, O Tatios, are incorporeal, and are exercised in the body
and by the body. Insomuch as they are incorporeal, thou mayest indeed call
them immortal; insomuch as they cannot be exercised but by means of a body,
I say that they are always in a body. That of which the end and cause are
determined by providence and necessity cannot remain inactive. That which
is shall still be, therein is its body and its life. For which reason there
will always be bodies; wherefore the creation of bodies is an eternal function.
For terrestrial bodies are corruptible; nevertheless, bodies are necessary
as abodes and as instruments for the energies. Now, the energies are immortal,
and that which is immortal is always active. The creation of bodies is,
then, a function, and an eternal function.
<p>The energies or faculties of the soul are not all at once manifest;
certain of them are manifest from the time of the birth of man, in the
non-rational part of his soul; and as the reasonable part develops itself
with age, the loftier faculties also lend their assistance. The faculties
are attached to bodies. They descend from divine forms into mortal forms,
and by them bodies are created. Each of the faculties exercises a function
either of the body or of the soul, but they subsist in the soul independently
of the body. For the energies are eternal, but the soul is not always imprisoned
in a mortal body. She can live without it, yet the faculties cannot manifest
themselves unless in a body. This, my son, is an arcane discourse. The
body cannot remain without the soul, but being can.
<p>Tatios.
<p>What meanest thou, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Understand me, O Tatios. When the soul is separated from the body, the
body indeed remains, but it is undermined by interior dissolution, and
ends by disintegrating. Such an effect cannot be produced without an active
cause; therefore, there remains some energy in the body after the withdrawal
of the soul. Between an immortal entity and a mortal entity there is this
difference: that the first is formed of simple substance, but not so the
second. One is active, the other passive. All active being dominates, all
passive being obeys; one is free, and governs; the other is in servitude,
and subject to impulsion.
<p>Now, the energies are not only in animate bodies, but in inanimate,
such as wood, stone, and other like things. By means of the energies these
things increase, fructify, ripen, decompose, dissolve, putrefy, disintegrate,
and undergo all those changes of which inanimate bodies are susceptible.
For energy is that which produces change, or becoming. And becoming is
multiple, or rather universal. Never will anything capable of birth be
wanting to the universe, because beings are continually brought forth by
it and continually destroyed. All energy is then indestructible, no matter
of what nature or in what body it is manifest. But among the energies,
some are exerted in divine entities, some in mortal entities; some are
universal, others special; some act upon species, others on individuals
pertaining to these. Divine energies are exerted in eternal entities, and
are perfect as these. Partial energies act by means of living beings; special
energies in everything which exists. Whence it results, my son, that the
whole universe is full of energies. For since energies necessarily manifest
in bodies, there are many bodies in the universe. Nevertheless, the energies
are more numerous than the bodies, for often there exist one, two, three
energies in a body, without counting those which are universally distributed.
I call those universal energies which are inseparable from bodies and which
manifest themselves by sensations and movements, and without which no body
could exist. Far otherwise are those special energies which manifest themselves
in human minds by art, science, and labour. The sensations accompany the
energies, or rather are the consequence of these last.
<p>Understand, O my son, the difference there is between the energies and
the sensations. Energy comes from above; sensation is of the body, and
from the body has its being. It is the seat of the energy, which manifests
by means of it, and from which it obtains, as it were, a vehicle. For this
reason I say that sensations are corporeal and mortal; their existence
is bound up with that of the body, they are born therewith, and therewith
they die. Immortal energies have not sensation, precisely because of the
nature of their essence; for there can be no other sensation than that
of some good or some evil which happens to a body or which departs therefrom,
and immortal entities are not subject to these accidents.
<p>Tatios.
<p>Sensation, then, is experienced by all bodies?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Yes, my son, and in all bodies the energies act.
<p>Tatios.
<p>Even in inanimate bodies, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Even in inanimate bodies. Sensations are of different kinds; those of
reasonable beings are accompanied by reason; those of beings without reason
are purely corporeal; those of inanimate beings are passive, and consist
only in growth and decay. Starting from one principle and arriving at one
end, passion and sensation are alike the product of the energies. In animate
beings, there are two other energies which accompany the passions and the
sensations--to wit, joy and sorrow. Without these, the animated being,
and, above all, the reasonable being, would feel nothing; they may then
be considered as modes of the affections in reasonable beings, or indeed
in all living beings. They are activities manifested by the sensations,
corporeal movements produced by the irrational parts of the soul. Joy and
sorrow are alike evil; for joy --- that is, the sensation accompanied by
pleasure --- draws after it great evils; sorrow, likewise, involves penalties
and suffering, yet more severe. Both joy and sorrow, then, are evil.
<p>Tatios.
<p>Is sensation the same thing in the soul and in the body, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>What meanest thou, my child, by the sensation of the soul?
<p>Tatios.
<p>The soul is truly incorporeal. But sensation is as a body, my father,
for it exists in a body.
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>If we place it in the body, my son, we indeed assimilate it either to
the soul or to the energies, which, although in the body, are incorporeal.
But sensation is neither an energy nor a soul, nor anything distinct from
the body; it is not, therefore, incorporeal. If it be not incorporeal,
it must necessarily be corporeal, for there is nothing which is neither
corporeal nor incorporeal.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b>PART III.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>THE Lord, the Creator of immortal forms, O Tatios, after having accomplished
His work, made nothing further, nor does He now make anything. Once consigned
to themselves and united to one another, these eternal forms move without
having need of anything; or if, indeed, they are necessary one to another,
they have at least no need of any extraneous impulsion, since they are
immortal. Such ought, indeed, to be the nature of the creations of the
supreme God. But our (immediate) maker has a body; he has brought us forth,
and unceasingly he brings forth, and will bring forth dissoluble and mortal
bodies, for he ought not to imitate his own Creator, and, moreover, he
cannot. For the first has evolved His creations from His own essence, primordial
and incorporeal; the second has formed us of that which is corporeal and
engendered. Whence it follows naturally, that heavenly forms born of incorporeal
essence are imperishable, while our bodies, being constituted of corporeal
matter, are consequently weak in themselves, and need extraneous assistance.
<p>For how, indeed, could the combination which composes our bodies be
sustained, if it were not continually fed and supported by elements of
the same nature? The earth, the water, the fire, and the air flow into
us and renew our covering. We are so weak that we cannot even endure a
single day of movement. Thou knowest well, my son, that without the repose
of the night our bodies would not resist the day's toil. For this reason
our good creator, in his universal providence, has ensured the continual
life of his creatures by devising sleep, the restorer of movement, and
by assigning to repose an equal or even longer time (than to labour). Meditate,
my son, on this virtue of sleep, opposed to that of the soul, and not less
energetic. For if the function of the soul be movement, bodies cannot live
without slumber, which loosens and unbinds the yoke of the organism, and
by its restoring action dispenses to it the matter which it needs, giving
water to the blood, earth to the bones, air to the nerves and vessels,
fire to the eyes. And hence the great pleasure which the body finds in
sleep.
<p>[NOTE.--The opening passage of this fragmentary discourse will not lead
the reader into error if he bears in mind the pantheistic character of
all Hermetic teaching. The influx of the divine substance into the universe
is perpetual, but the channels or forms through which&nbsp; it flows are
immutable, unchangeable, and self-sustaining. The method of nature is determined
from the beginning, and is incapable of variation or of intermittance.
But the descent of soul into generation is a continual process, and will
not cease until the creative period or "Day of Manifestation" closes. There
has never been any suspension of the divine energies since the commencement
of their primordial operation. The outflow of Being into Existence is unending,
otherwise natural generation would cease, and evolution be arrested. The
secondary creator mentioned in this fragment is the Demiourgos, the fabricator
of the material universe. --- A.K.]

<p><b>PART IV.</b></center>

<p>GREAT and divine power is established, O my son, in the midst of the
universe, beholding all that is done by men upon earth. In the divine order
all is governed by providential Necessity; among men the same function
belongs to Justice. The first of these governments includes celestial things,
for the Gods neither will, nor can, transgress; not being subject to error,
which is the source of sin, they are sinless. The second, Justice, is charged
to correct, upon earth, the evil which happens among men. The human race,
being mortal, and formed of corruptible matter, is subject to fall away
when the sight of divine things does not sustain it (in virtue). Herein
Justice exerts its action. By means of the energies which he draws from
Nature, man is subject to Destiny; by the errors of his life, to Justice.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b>PART VI.</b></center>

<p>O MY son, matter becomes; formerly it was, for matter is the vehicle
of becoming. 1 Becoming is the mode of activity of the uncreate and foreseeing
God. Having been endowed with the germ of becoming, matter is brought into
birth, for the creative force fashions it according to the ideal forms.
Matter not yet engendered, had no form; it becomes when it is put into
operation.
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>133:[1] Dr. Menard observes that in Greek, the same word signifies p.
134 to be born and to become. The idea here is that the material of the
world is in its essence eternal, but that before creation or "becoming,"
it is in a passive and motionless condition. Thus it "was" before being
"put into operation;" now, it "becomes," that is, it is mobile and progressive.
Creation is thus the period of activity of God, who, according to Hermetic
thought, has two modes--Activity, or existence, God evolved (Deus explicitus);
and Passivity of Being--God involved (Deus implicitus). Both modes are
perfect and complete, as are the waking and sleeping states of man. Fichte,
the German philosopher, distinguished Being (Seyn) as One, which we know
only through existence (Daseyn) as the Manifold. This view is thoroughly
Hermetic. The "Ideal Forms," mentioned in the above fragment, are the archetypal
or formative ideas of the Neo-Platonists; the eternal and subjective concepts
of things subsisting in the Divine Mind prior to "creation" or "becoming."

<p><b>PART VII.</b></center>

<p>TO speak of the Real with certainty, O Tatios, is an impossible thing
to man, himself an imperfect creature, composed of imperfect parts, and
constituted of an assemblage of foreign particles; nevertheless, as much
as it is possible and permissible to me, I affirm that Reality is only
in eternal beings, the forms of which also are real. Fire is but fire and
no more; earth is nothing else than earth; air is only air. Put our bodies
are compounded of all these; we have in us fire, earth, water, and air,
which yet are neither fire, nor earth, nor water, nor air, nor anything
truly. If, then, from the beginning Reality is foreign to our constitution,
how shall we behold Reality, or speak thereof, or even understand it, unless
indeed by the Will of God? Mundane things, O Tatios, are not then themselves
real, but the simulacra of Reality, and not all are even such; some are
but illusion and error, O Tatios, fantastic appearances, mere phantoms.
When
such an appearance receives an influx from above, then, indeed, it becomes
a similitude of the Real, but without this superior influence it remains
an illusion. In the same way a portrait is a painted image of a body, but
not the body it represents. It appears to have eyes, but sees nothing;
ears, but hears nothing; and so on of the rest of it. It is an image which
deceives the sight; it appears a reality, and is but a shadow. Those who
behold not the False behold the True; if, then, we understand and see everything
as it truly is, we see the Real; but if we see that which is not, we can
neither understand nor know anything of the Real.
<p>Tatios.
<p>There is, then, my father, a Real even upon earth?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>Reality is not upon the earth, my son, and it cannot be thereon, but
it can be comprehended by a few men to whom God vouchsafes the divine vision.
Nothing on earth is real, there are only appearances and opinions on earth;
yet all is real for intelligence and reason. Wherefore to think and to
speak the truth this indeed may be called real.
<p>Tatios.
<p>What sayest thou? It is right to think and speak that which truly is,
and yet nothing is true upon earth?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>This certainly is true, that we know nothing of Truth. How should it
be otherwise, my son? Truth is the supreme virtue, the sovereign Good which
is not obscured by matter, nor circumscribed by the body; the naked Good,
evident, unalterable, august, immutable. Now, the things which are here
below thou seest, my son, are incompatible with the Good; they are perishable,
changing, various, passing from form to form. That which is not even identical
with itself, how can it be real? All that transforms itself is illusive,
not only in itself, but by the appearances which it presents to us one
after another.
<p>Tatios.
<p>Is not even man real, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>He is not real, my son, as man. The real consists solely in itself,
and remains what it is. Man is composed of manifold elements, and does
not continue identical with himself. So long as he inhabits a body he passes
from one age to another, and from one form to another. Often, after but
a short interval of time, parents no longer are able to recognize their
children, nor children their parents. That which changes in such wise as
to be no longer recognizable as itself, can it be a real thing, Tatios?
Should we not rather think this succession of diverse appearances an illusion?
Look only on the eternal and the Good as the Real. Man is transient, therefore
he is not real; he is but appearance, and appearance is the supreme illusion.
<p>Tatios.
<p>Then the celestial bodies themselves are not real, my father, since
they also vary.
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>That which is subject to birth and to change is not real, but the works
of the great Father may receive from Him a real substance. Nevertheless,
there is in them a certain falsity, seeing that they too are variable,
for nothing is real save that which is identical with itself.
<p>Tatios.
<p>What, then, may we call indeed real, my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>The sun, the only one of all creatures that changes not, and which remains
the same. For this reason is confided to him alone the ordinance of the
universe; he is the chief and the maker of everything; I venerate him and
prostrate myself before his truth, and, after the first Unity, I recognize
in him the creator.
<p>Tatios.
<p>And what, then, is the primordial Reality, O my father?
<p>Trismegistos.
<p>He Who is One and alone, O Tatios; He Who is not made of matter, nor
in any body, Who has neither colour nor form, Who changes not, nor is transmuted,
but who always Is.
<p>That which is illusion is perishable, my son. The providence of the
Real has limited and will limit by dissolution all mundane things, for
dissolution is the condition of all births; all that is brought forth dissolves
in order to be again brought forth. It is necessary that out of dissolution
life should come into existence, and that life in its turn should decay,
in order that the generation of creatures should never cease. Behold, then,
in this perpetual birth, the Creator before all! Creatures born of dissolution
are but shadows, they become at one time this, at another that; for they
cannot be the same, and how is it possible for that which is not identical
with itself, to be a real thing? Such must then, my son, be called appearances,
and man must be regarded as an appearance of Humanity; as, also, a child
is an appearance of childhood, a young man of adolescence, an adult of
manhood, an old man of senility. For how shall it be said that a man is
a man, a child a child, a youth a youth, a grown man a grown man, an old
man an old man, since by incessant transformations they deceive us both
as to what they were, and what they have become? Behold, then, in all these
things, my son, only the illusive appearances of a superior Reality; and
since, indeed, this is the case, I define Illusion as the expression of
the Real.

<p>TO understand God is difficult; to speak of God, impossible. For the
corporeal cannot express the incorporeal; the imperfect cannot comprehend
the perfect. How is the eternal to be associated with the transient? The
first abides for ever, the other is fleeting; the first is the Real, the
other is a reflected shadow. As much as weakness differs from strength,
or smallness from greatness, so much the mortal differs from the divine.
The distance which divides them one from the other obscures the vision
of the beautiful. Bodies are visible to sight, and that which the eye beholds
the tongue is able to express. But that which has not any body, nor appearance,
nor form, nor matter, cannot be apprehended by sense.
<p>I understand, O Tatios, I understand that which it is impossible to
define--that is God.

<p><b>FRAGMENTS of the WRITINGS</b>
<br><b>of</b>
<br><b>HERMES to AMMON.</b>
<p><b>PART I.</b></center>

<p>THAT which rules the universe is Providence; that which contains the
universe and limits it is Necessity; Destiny impels and enfolds all things
by the compulsory force which belongs thereto. It is Destiny which is the
cause of birth and of the dissolution of Life. The universe, then, first
receives Providence, the first ordained. Providence extends to the skies,
about which the Gods revolve, in perpetual and untiring motion. There is
Destiny because there is Necessity. Providence foresees, Destiny determines,
the position of the stars. Such is the universal law.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<center>
<p><b>PART II.</b></center>

<p>ALL things are produced by Nature and Destiny, nor is any place void
of Providence. Providence is the Free Will of the Supreme God; whence two
spontaneous forces, Necessity and Destiny. Destiny is subject to Providence
and to Necessity; and to Destiny are subject the stars. Therefore, no man
can escape from Destiny, nor arm himself against the action of the stars.
For they are the instruments of Destiny; by their means the will of Destiny
is accomplished throughout all Nature and in human existence. [1]
<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>142:[1] I commend the above fragments to the careful consideration of
Hermetists. Many persons find it difficult to reconcile belief in the "ruling
of the stars" with belief in free will. At first sight it appears unjust
and arbitrary that certain lines of life --- even vicious ones --- should
be indicated by the "rulers of nativities" as the only lines in which the
"native" will prosper; and they ask incredulously whether it can be rationally
supposed that the "accident" of the day and hour of birth, is, by Divine
Providence, permitted to direct and dominate the whole career of an intelligent
and responsible being. But this objection is superficial, and the result
of incomplete knowledge. For the difficulties of astrological science,
if viewed in the light of Karmic Predestination or Fate, not only disappear,
but give place to the unfoldment of a most lucid and admirable system of
responsible causation. There is but one hypothesis capable of solving the
enigma of Fate, and that hypothesis is a doctrine common to all the greater
schools of thought --- Vedic, Buddhist, Kabbalistic, Hermetic, Platonic,
--- the hypothesis, to wit, of multiple existences, or the doctrine of
the Metempsychosis. Destiny, in the view of these philosophies, is not
arbitrary, but acquired. Every man makes his own Fate; and nothing is truer
than the saying that "Character is Destiny." For that which in one existence
is Will, becomes in the next Fate. By the hands of men themselves, then,
are their natal lines cast, whether in pleasant and virtuous, or in painful
and p. 143 vicious paths. For in what manner soever an ego conducts itself
in one existence, by that conduct, by that order of thought and habit it
builds for itself its destiny in a future existence. And the ego is enchained
by these pre-natal influences, and by them irresistibly compelled into
a new nativity at the time of such conjunction of planets and signs as
oblige it into certain courses, or incline it strongly thereto. Hence "Destiny,"
or Karma, is said by Hermes to "determine the position of the stars." And
if the course so defined be evil, and the ruling such as to favour chiefly
vicious propensities, the afflicted ego, even though assuredly reaping
the just effects of its own demerit, is not left without a remedy. For
the ego may oppose its will to the stellar ruling, and heroically adopt
a course opposed to the direction of the natal influences. Thereby, indeed,
the ego may bring itself under a curse for such period as those influences
have power, for, as Hermes tells us, "no man can escape from Destiny, nor
preserve himself from the action of the stars;" but at the same time, the
will thus exerted will reverse the planetary affinities acquired, and give
a new "set" to the current of the Karmic predestination, so that the ruling
signs of the next nativity will be favourable to virtue and to a loftier
state. But the "stars" and "stellar influences" which are thus the "instruments
of Destiny" are immediately microcosmic, and only mediately macrocosmic.

<p><b>PART III.</b></center>

<p>THE soul is, then, an incorporeal essence, and even when she is in a
body, she does not wholly lose her manner of being. Her essence is that
of perpetual movement, the spontaneous movement of thought; yet is she
not moved in any thing else, nor towards any thing else, nor for any thing
else. For she is a primordial force, and that which is primal needs not
that which is secondary. The expression "in any thing" is applicable to
place, to time, to nature; "towards any thing" is applicable to a harmony,
to a form, to a figure; "for any thing" is applicable to the body, because
time, place, nature, and form are related to the body. All these terms
are conjoined by reciprocal bonds. The body requires place, for it is not
possible to conceive of a body unless also of a place occupied by it; a
body changes its nature, such change is not possible unless in time, and
by means of movement in nature; nor can the component parts of a body be
united unless by harmony of form. Space exists on account of corporeity,
it contains the changes thereof and suffers it not to be annihilated in
these changes. The body passes from one condition to another, but in quitting
its first condition it ceases not to be body, it takes only another condition.
It was body, it remains body, its state alone varies; wherefore, that which
changes in corporeity is quality and mode of being. Place, time, and natural
movement, themselves bodiless, have each their special property. The property
of space is to contain; the property of time is interval and number; the
property of nature is movement; the property of harmony is affinity; the
property of body is change; the property of soul is thought.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">

<p><b>PART IV.</b></center>

<p>THE soul is then an incorporeal essence; if she had a body she would
be unable to preserve herself, for every body has need of breath and of
life which consists in order. Wherever there is birth there is fluxion.
To "become" presupposes magnitude, that is augmentation; augmentation involves
diminution, which, in turn, brings about destruction. That which receives
the form of life participates in being by means of the soul. In order to
produce existence, it is necessary to exist; existence I define to be a
reasonable becoming and participation in intelligent life. Life constitutes
the creature, intelligence renders it reasonable, the body makes it mortal.
The soul is then incorporeal, and possesses an immutable force. Can an
intelligent creature exist without a living essence? Can he be rational
if an intelligent essence does not maintain in him rational life? If intelligence
does not manifest itself in all creatures, it is on account of the constitution
of the body in regard to harmony. If heat dominates in the constitution
thereof, the creature is volatile and ardent; if cold dominates, it is
heavy and slow. Nature distributes the elements of the body according to
a law of harmony. This harmonic combination has three forms:--the hot,
the cold, and the temperate. Conjunction is established according to stellar
influence. The soul appropriates the body destined to her, and causes it
to live by the operation of nature. Nature assimilates the harmony of bodies
to the disposition of the stars, and the combination of their elements
to the harmony of the stars; so that there may be reciprocal sympathy.
For the purpose of stellar harmony is to engender sympathies in agreement
with Destiny.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">

<p><b>PART V.</b></center>

<p>THE soul is then, O Ammon, an essence having its end in itself, receiving
from the beginning the life prepared for her, and attracting to herself,
as a material, a certain reason endowed with passion and desire. Passion
is a matter; if it enters into accord with the intelligent part of the
soul, it becomes courage, and does not yield to fear. Desire also is a
matter; in association with the rational part of the soul, it becomes aspiration
and yields not to voluptuousness. For reason enlightens the blindness of
desire. When the faculties of the soul are thus coordinated under the supremacy
of reason, they produce justice. The government of the faculties of the
soul belongs to the Intellectual Principle which subsists in itself in
its provident reason, having for authority its own reason. It governs all
like a magistrate; its provident reason serves it as counsellor. The reason
of this Principle is the cognizance of the reasons which furnish the image
of rationality to the irrational; an image relatively obscure when compared
with reason, but rational when compared to the irrational, as an echo compared
to a voice, or the light of the moon compared to that of the sun. Passion
and desire are ordained according to a certain reason; they mutually attract
each other, and establish between them a circulatory current of thought.
Every soul is immortal, and always in movement. For we have seen that movements
proceed either from energies or from bodies. We have seen, also, that the
soul, being incorporeal, proceeds not from any matter, but from an essence
incorporeal itself. Everything that is born is necessarily produced by
some other thing. Two movements necessarily accompany everything the generation
of which involves decay; that of the soul which moves it, and that of the
body which augments, diminishes, and decomposes it, in decomposing itself.
It is thus that I define the movement of perishable bodies. But the soul
is perpetually in motion, without cessation she moves and produces movement.
Thus every soul is immortal and always in motion, moved by her own activity.
There are three species in souls: divine, human, and irrational. The divine
soul abides in a divine form, it is therein that she has her energy; therein
she moves and acts. When this soul separates herself from mortal creatures,
she forsakes her irrational parts and enters into the divine form; and,
as she is always in motion, she is borne along in the universal movement.
The human soul has also something divine, but she is bound to irrational
elements desire and passion; these elements are undying, because they are
energies; but they are energies of mortal bodies, therefore they are removed
from the divine part of the soul, which inhabits the divine form. When
this divine part enters into a mortal body and meets therein these irrational
elements, she becomes, by means of their presence, a human soul. The soul
of animals is composed of passion and desire, therefore the animals are
called brutes, because their soul is deprived of reason. The fourth species
in soul, that possessed by inanimate creatures, is placed outside the bodies
actuated. This soul moves in the divine form, and impels it passively.

<p><b>PART VI.</b></center>

<p>THE soul is, then, an eternal and intelligent essence; having for thought
her own reason. She enters into association with the concept of harmony.
Separated from the physical body, she endures in herself, she is independent
in the Ideal world. She controls her reason, and confers on the entity
emerging into life a movement analogous to her own thought, that is being;
for the property of the soul is to assimilate other things to her own character.
There are two kinds of vital movement: the one conform-able to the essence
of the soul, the other to the nature of the body. The first is general,
the second particular; the first is independent, the second is subject
to necessity. For everything moved is subject to the necessary law of the
mover. But the motor movement is united by affinity to the intelligent
principle. It behoves the soul to be incorporeal, and to be essentially
different from the physical body, for if she had a body she would have
neither reason nor thought. All bodies are unintelligent, but in receiving
the spirit they become animated and breathe. The breath belongs to the
body, but reason contemplates the beauty of the essential. The sensible
spirit discerns appearances. It is distributed into organic sensations;
mental perception is a part of it, as also is the acoustic, olfactive,
gustative, and tactile sense. This spirit, attracted by thought, discerns
sensations, otherwise it creates only phantoms, for it belongs to the body,
and receives all things. The reason of the essential is the judgment. To
the reason belongs the cognizance of lofty things; but to the sensible
spirit, opinion. This last receives its energy from the external world;
but the former from within itself.

<p><br>
<br>
<p>THERE are, then, essential spirit, reason, intelligence, perception.
Opinion and sensation tend towards perception, reason towards the essential
spirit; thought advances independently. Thought is associated with perception.
Conjoined, all these become a single form, which is that of the soul. Opinion
and sensation tend also towards perfection, but they do not continue in
the same condition, they exhibit excess, failure, or variation. Separated
from perception, they deteriorate; approximating to and following it, they
participate in the intellectual reason through the sciences. We have the
power of choice; it depends on us to choose either the best or the worst
by our will. The choice of evil approximates us to the corporeal nature,
and subjects us to Destiny. The intellectual spirit which is in us, being
free, the intellectual reason is free also, always identical with itself,
and independent of Destiny. Therefore, in following this higher and intelligent
reason, ordained by the supreme God, the spirit is superior to the order
of Nature over creatures; but the soul which attaches herself to these
creatures participates in their destiny, though foreign to their nature.

<p><i>Footnotes</i>
<p>150:[1] In the above fragment the power of the human will is clearly
asserted as the only instrument by which Destiny may be controlled. By
continued and ardent striving towards the purely spiritual and intelligent,
the soul frees herself from the power of Destiny (Karma), and at length
passes into beatitude. She transcends natural order, and enters into the
divine. This is Saintship. Inversely, by attaching herself to sensible
things, and by suffering herself to be borne away by passion and desire
towards illusory existence, she becomes caught on the ever-rolling wheel
of Destiny, and made subject to the order of Nature, which is that of Metamorphosis.
Whereas her true duty and happiness are to aspire continually upwards,
addressing herself by means of purified passion and desire towards the
One, and away from the Manifold. --- A.K.

<p>THERE is, then, a state of Being superior to all beings, and to all
that actually is. Being is that by which universal essentiality is common
to all intelligible entities actually existing. . . Nature is sensible
essentiality, including in itself all sensible objects. Midway are the
intellectual and sensible gods. The concepts of intelligence are related
to the intellectual gods, the concepts of opinion to the sensible gods,
which are reflexions of the intelligences; as, for instance, the sun is
the image of the creative and celestial God. For as God has created the
universe, so the sun creates animals, produces plants, and governs fluid
things.

<p>WHEREFORE the incorporeal vision comes forth from the body to contemplate
beauty, lifting itself up and adoring, not the form, nor the body, nor

<p>IF thou understandest this one and only Good, thou wilt find nothing
impossible, for all virtue is therein. Think not that this Good is in anyone,
nor that it is outside of anyone. It is without limit, being the limit
of all. Nothing contains it, it contains all in itself. For what distinction
is there between the corporeal and the incorporeal, the create and the
uncreate; that which is subject to necessity and that which is free; between
terrestrial things and things celestial, corruptible things and things
eternal?&nbsp; Is it not that these subsist freely, and that those are
subject to the bondage of necessity? That which is below is imperfect and
perishable.

<p>BENEATH nature and the ideal world is placed the pyramid. Its corner
stone, placed on its summit, is the Creative Word of the universal Lord,
which, after Him, is the first Power, uncreate, infinite, begotten of Him
and antecedent to all His creations. He is the offspring of the Most Perfect,
the fruitful and true Son. The nature of this intelligent Word is a generating
and productive nature. Call it as thou wilt--generation, or nature, or
character. But think this only, that he is perfect in the Perfect, and
issued from the Perfect, that all his works are perfectly good, and that
he is the source of creation and of life. Since such is his nature, he
is well named.
<p>But for the providence of the Lord of the universe Who causes me to
reveal these words, you would not have so great a desire to seek out such
matters. Now, therefore, hear the end of this discourse. This Spirit of
whom I have so often spoken is necessary to all; for he maintains all,
he gives life to all, he nourishes all. He outflows from the holy Source,
and without ceasing comes to the aid of spirits and to all living creatures.

rendered the water fruitful."
