      <p><b><font size="+1">Commentary by Adam McLean:</font></b> </p>
      <p><i> </i>The <i>Pretiosissimum Donum Dei</i>, 'the most
        precious gift of God', is an important early alchemical work,
        with a famous series of 12 illustrations. I have identified over
        60 manuscripts of the <i>Donum Dei</i>, the earliest dating
        from the 15th century. Some of these versions ascribe the work
        to Georgius Aurach de Argentina [sometimes 'Anrach'] and date it
        to 1475. There are versions in Latin, German, French and
        Italian, and one in English in the British Library MS. Harley
        6453, which I have transcribed and show here. I have added the
        engravings from J.D. Mylius' Anatomia Auri, 1628. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had the science of this Art only from
        the Inspiration of God, who to this servant has vouchsafed to
        declare the true reasons to judge and discern, giving strength
        hath less occasion to no man, nor any excusation from him.
        Forsooth if I feared not the day of Judgment I would never open
        anything of this science or publish it to any man. But I am
        willed to render my duty to faithful men as their Anchor of
        faith hath given it unto me. He that knoweth not the principles
        in himself is very far from the art of philosophy for he hath
        not the true book whereupon he should ground his intent. But if
        he do chiefly and principally know the natural causes of himself
        and know not the other, yet hath he the way to the way of the
        principles of the Art. And although a man know the Matter, yet
        there remaineth many things to the completement of the same. And
        it is necessary that our stone be drawn out of the natures of
        two bodies before the Elixir may be made complete, therefore it
        is worthily said: O water in form Pontic, or bitter which
        dissolves the Elements, O most greatest Nature, the creature of
        Nature which containeth Nature, and overcometh the nature of the
        meanys what cometh with light and with light it is engendered
        and she that is mother of all, how black a cloud hath she
        brought out. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Chapter of the Green Lion and of what
              Colour it is.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First in our green Lion is had the true
        matter and of what colour it is, and is called Adrop or Azocke,
        [<i>clopum</i>], Duenech. If thou will well understand this
        work, read it from part to part and thou shall see miracles
        wrought in our days, and unless I had seen them and touched them
        I could not so particularly have written them and painted them.
        I have not shown all the appearances and things necessary in
        this work, for there be some that be not lawful to be spoken of
        man, that I have set it out in pictures to the end or
        completement. And there was never no sure work so described and
        with authorities to the purpose. For it is impossible to be
        known without it be known of God or of a master which may fear
        him. Understand that it is a very long way, therefore patience
        and tarrying be very necessary. For in our Magistery there be
        some foolish and blind which saith they can make Aurum potable
        of common Gold or else they believe that it is most best to heal
        all infirmities. Also there are some Physicians which causeth
        ducats to be boiled in water saying this thing is most best for
        the health, but it is rather evil and not to be drunk. For it is
        clean contrary, saving their reverence, that that was Aurum
        Potabile or if that it was good for the health. For neither
        common gold or other metals be good to heal with, but they [are]
        rather evil as I have said and not able to be drunk. But I will
        grant they be good and most best to buy confections with and to
        pay the physician. Also they be good to be had basins full of
        ducats or fine gold and so show them to the sick man for it is a
        great comfort to see the gold, but the true aurum potabile of
        the philosophers is the Elixir complete. And this is Aurum
        potabile not visible but in power, which is the great medicine,
        which removeth all superfluities as well of many bodies and of
        metals, for it converteth all metals imperfect from Leprosy and
        from Infirmity, and likewise the bodies of man. And this is most
        certain. Note this is the intent of all philosophers, but these
        which doth understand it to be of common gold be blind and more
        than blind and deceivers. For if common gold should give of this
        perfection to another, then should he himself remain imperfect.
        Wherefore would you have this science reading only one book or
        finding the first regiment? Now following, the philosophers have
        said that the truth is not discerned without error, and nothing
        converteth more sorrow to the heart than error in this art.
        Therefore when I spared not my life in so great age to practice,
        lest peradventure because of the chiding's of this wisdom I
        might be dampened. First I shall praise God who is the beholder
        of all things nor any thing that is hid from him, to whom be
        honour and glory by all the world of worlds. Amen. </p>

        come to thee, and am most ready to conceive a form, to whom is

        Trismegistus, he varieth not from him in any text for that you

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Stone is a body without sound mortifying
        and quickening, so that nothing contrary enter with our stone,
        but put himself only conjoin the servant to his odoriferous
        sister and between them the art shall be engendered. For if the
        white woman be married to the red man anon they do embrace and
        so [hawsinge] be coupled together, by themselves they be
        dissolved, and by themselves they be made, that they that were
        two is made as it were one body. And know that there be three
        perfect colours from the which all the others take there
        beginning. The first is black, the second white, and the third
        red, there be many other colours, but they be not to be cared
        for, for they vanish away oftentimes before the whiteness, Then
        is made the commixtion of two bodies, and it is necessary in our
        Magistery, and if there were but one only body of the two, in
        our Stone, it should now go be tincture by any manner of means,
        and therefore it is necessary the conjunction of these two
        bodies, which two when they be conjoined, and received in the
        commixtion of the Stone, the Stone is engendered in the belly of
        the wind, and that is that which the philosopher saith. The wind
        hath born him in his belly, it is plain that the wind is Air,
        and Air is life, and the life is the Soul, that is oil, and
        water. I that am exalted above all the circles of the world have
        four faces having one father, whereof one is in the mountains,

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convert the natures of the Elements and thou
        shalt find what thou seekest. To convert the natures is to make
        a body a spirit in our Magistery, first we make of gross thin,
        and of a body water, and by consequent we make that which is
        beneath as that which is above, and the contrary, for the bodies
        dissolved are reduced to the nature of spirits, and they be
        never separated asunder, like as water is mixed with water, and
        truly all the regiment and work is none other, but water

        once, but that a little, and a little may come out every day
        until it may be made complete in a long time. I am black of

        from his back pure water. Understand the gift of God, receive it
        and hide it from all unwise philosophers, for it is not hidden
        from the caverns of the metals, which stone is mineral, and
        animal, shining colours, or high hill, and an open sea. Behold I
        have expound it to you, truly when it is first black, we call it
        the cave of the science which is not without blackness, for it
        is the tincture which we seek, for in every body we give or put
        colour, which thing was hidden in his brass, as the Soul in
        man's body. Therefore dear Son, when thou art in thy work, see
        first thou have the black colour, and then art thou sure thou
        dost putrefy and proceedest the right way, patience and tarrying
        be necessary in our work. O Blessed Nature and blessed is thine

        that all the matter be dissolved into water. Afterwards govern

        the saying of the philosophers. And as we have seen and touched

        then it behoveth to continue an easy fire upon it, until such

        dissolveth into black powder, may enter into this water and all

        water and fire be sufficient to thee. For they wash the body,

        calcine it by his manner of calcining and flying, for so have
        you sufficiently governed the Earth of the Stone in
        administration. To calcine is no other thing then to dry and to
        turn in to ashes. Therefore burn it without fear, until it be
        ashes, which when it is so thou hast mixed it well. Despise not
        these ashes but give it them the sweat that they have cast out,
        and when the water is all drank up and turned into earth within
        certain days will be done. In this vessel shall appear all ye

        Therefore let it stand certain days upon easy fire until it be

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take white laton and break your books to
        pieces lest your hearts be broken. For our Art is easy and a
        little help will serve. He that maketh me white shall make me
        red, for white and red proceedeth from one Root, that which is
        in the white is in the red, therefore work philosophically, and
        if thou make white and pass the limits, or end thereof, thou art
        blessed, this thing if thou shalt see it suddenly, admiration or
        marvel, fear and dread, shall come upon thee. Decant therefore,
        grind, and reiterate, though the work be tedious and long, for
        it is done with long decoction, know ye that the flower of the
        stone is the stone of the Stone, roast it therefore by certain
        days until it be shining as Marble, and know when it is so, that
        it is the most greatest secret. For the stone is mixed to the
        stone. Now most dear friend thou hast learned to make the white.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is to speak of the red, but if thou
        first make not white, never can there be made true red, for no
        man may come from the first to the third but by the second, So
        canst thou not come from black to the citrine but by the white,
        because that the citrine is made one compound of much white and
        a little black. Therefore make white the black, and make red the
        white and you have the art. For the year is divided into four
        parts, and so is our blessed work. The first is winter cold and
        moist, the second is ver, hot and moist, and flourishing. The
        third is the summer time, hot and dry, and red. The fourth is
        the harvest cold and dry, which is the time of gathering of
        fruit. This disposition colouring nature govern until such time
        it bring forth ripe fruit at pleasure. But now the winter is
        past, the showers be gone away. For the flowers hath appeared in
        our earth in the time of ver. But we go about the white rose for
        they made every imperfect or sick body to be turned into true
        silver. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore when thou seest the whiteness
        appearing above in all parts be sure, that in that whiteness is
        there hidden redness. Therefore then you must draw out all the
        whiteness and decoct it until such time it be made red
        thoroughly. </p>
