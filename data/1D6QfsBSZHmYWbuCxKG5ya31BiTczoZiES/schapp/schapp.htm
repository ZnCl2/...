      </center>
      <p>In a book titled <i>The Physics of the Primary State of Matter</i>,
        published in the 1930s, Karl Schappeller described his Prime
        Mover, a 10-inch steel sphere with quarter-inch copper tubing
        coils. These were filled with a material not named specifically,
        but which is said to have hardened under the influence of direct
        current and a magnetic field [electro-rheological fluid]. With
        such polarization, it might be guessed to act like a dielectric
        capacitor and as a diode. </p>
      <p>The same material is inside the rotor. The transfer of
        electrons upward, and the magnetic field of the sphere combine
        to turn the rotor. No direct conversion of this energy to
        electricity is described, but the rotor could be attached to a
        generator... </p>
      <p>According to Schappeller, the amount of this sustaining
        rotation of the device would be termed ‘glowing magnetism’ and
        be located at the center of the sphere. Present day terminology
        might be ‘plasma’. </p>

                Matter</font></i></b> </p>

          1955</p>

      <p><b>The New Technique ~</b> </p>
      <p>The important fact from the point of view of the New Technique
        is that the only source of primary magnetism is glowing core of
        hydrogen energy, or the primary magnetism as force is magnetism
        in the glowing state, or glowing magnetism, which is the Primary
        Force, or if we must use the present terms, the atomic force,
        the chemical composition of which is a hydrogen energy core
        interacting through mobility with its complementary cold oxygen
        energy stress field, the physics of which has already been
        explained. </p>
      <p>The fulcrum or basis of the New Technique based on the physics
        of the Primary State is thus the production of a core of glowing
        magnetism, the greatest available force within the reach of man,
        and in the Cosmos the great creative origin-force in all Nature.
      </p>
      <p>In the cosmos we learned that the essential factor to the
        formation of a glowing core was the establishment of a magnetic
        point of inequality in the otherwise latent homogenous stress
        field. </p>
      <p>Obviously, we have not the same faculties as are available in
        the cosmos, and so the crux of the whole problem in the New
        Technique is this forming of a point of inequality in the ether,
        under such conditions that a glowing hydrogen core, or glowing
        magnetism, will form as a space-form impression entity and be
        maintained as such. </p>
      <p>Primary magnetism, or a glowing hydrogen core of energy, is
        always spherical, because it forms radially concentrically on
        the point of inequality. </p>
      <p>It is therefore clear that the first technical problem we have
        to solve is: what form of technical appliance is there which
        will put a spherical stress on any given point in the ether? The
        stress must, of course, be magnetic or electromagnetic in
        quality and thereby exert a suction on the ether on and to this
        point so that the surrounding ether will be drawn in, catalyzed,
        and finally radiated out as a stimulated stressfield which can
        be made to perform work of all kinds, just as the electric
        current is now used to produce mechanical power, light, heat and
        electrolysis for all forms of industrial purposes. There is a
        similar medical application to healing, radiology, diathermy and
        electrotherapy through ionization of the particular salts or
        drugs required by any given condition of the body, and
        multifarious other applications (See Part III). </p>
      <p>So we now have as our guide the fact that the appliance must be
        capable of continually receiving and holding an electromagnetic
        charge, the form of which must be spherical. </p>
      <p>The appliance nearest to this at present available is perhaps
        the solenoid, which is simply a coil of wire through which an
        electric current is passed. The electric current produces a
        magnetic field round the wire coil on which the ether exerts a
        force of attraction or a suction force, because the ether itself
        is latent magnetism; and we know that if through the center of
        this coil or solenoid we insert a bar of steel the magnetic
        stress from the solenoid will be induced into the steel bar, and
        the bar will be said the be magnetized. </p>
      <p>Suppose, therefore, we produce a magnetic field of spherical
        form, that is, wind our wire in the form of a sphere, and
        provide it with a suitable support and covering. This would
        hardly satisfy our requirements, </p>
      <p>(1) because an electric current will always have to be supplied
        from an exterior source; </p>
      <p>(2) because this type or quality of magnetic field would only
        magnetize a piece of iron or steel placed in the center of the
        spherical solenoid and the Ether would not react to this type of
        gauss field; </p>
      <p>(3) the current in the solenoid is held adhesively to the
        cohesive force of the wire and cannot therefore put a stress on
        a point in the geometric center of the spherical solenoid, as
        its complementary stressfield in this case is the cohesive force
        of the wire itself and it has thus no complementary stressfield
        or contra-pole external to its Space-form. </p>
      <p>It will thus be perfectly clear that a field produced as at
        present through the medium of passing a current through a copper
        wire would not fulfill the purpose, and that we require some
        form of field which will spring out on to its geometrical center
        and thus draw with it the surrounding Ether, until finally the
        pressure on the point from the ether compression on the
        constantly inrushing ether brings it to the glowing state and a
        physical point of origin is formed on the geometrical center of
        the Sphere, or, as Schappeller terms this apparatus, the Stator.
      </p>
      <p><b>The Electret ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have seen that the numerous so-called "effects" in Physics
        owe their origin to the crossing of two stressfields, e.g.,
        Nernst, Ettinghaus, Hall, Leduc, Peltier and Thompson effects;
        these may be said to ring the charges between, say, heat and
        electricity, electricity and magnetism, and so forth; others
        have been cited, producing different effects, but all are caused
        by the same principle or law -- <i>that energy can neither be
          produced nor transformed without the crossing of two
          stressfields</i>. </p>
      <p>An experimental physicist once declared that he had nothing to
        do with the "crossing of stressfields". Neither has the
        housewife anything to do with the "boiling of water"; she merely
        places the kettle on the fire, then Nature crosses the
        stressfields, i.e., the heat stress crosses the cohesive force
        or stressfield of the water. This is the case in all the effects
        cited above; but the components, and thus the products, differ
        in each case. </p>
      <p>The deeper the study of present Physics, the more this law is
        firmly established. </p>
      <p>We are now about to examine another effect, which plays an
        important part in the New Technique, viz., the Permanent
        Electret, named by the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan in
        1920. </p>
      <p>Prof. Mototaro Eguchi (Prof. Of Physics, naval College, Tokyo)
        produced his own special electret, which constitutes really <i>the






          permanent magnet of the electrostatic sphere</i>. </p>
      <p>He used as the dielectric, carnauba wax and resin with or
        without a percentage of beeswax and kept it in a strong electric
        field whilst slowly baking until solidification set in. Once
        again we have the crossing of the two stressfields, the cohesive
        force of the dielectric, but this time with an electric field,
        aided by heat stress. </p>
      <p>The heat stress was in a plastic condition as a slowly
        solidifying dielectric, and the resulting effect was the
        permanent electrisation of the dielectric, effecting a kind of
        dielectric polarization. </p>
      <p>The nature of the electric charge produced in the dielectric is
        a permanent internal electrisation entirely different from the
        superficial electrification. </p>
      <p>For example, the electrisation cannot be destroyed by different
        treatment applied to the surface, e.g., a Bunsen flame, x-ray
        exposure washing with solvents, planning with a knife, or by
        applying electric force in any sense. </p>
      <p>Electrisation, as opposed to mere electrification, is really
        therefore the electrification of the whole bound stressfield of
        the dielectric in question. </p>
      <p>Heaviside coined this new term "electrisation" to signify an
        internal electrical change of a material, which is quite
        different from superficial electrification. </p>
      <p>The PP [Primary Physics] explanation of this phenomenon is that
        the electric fielding H and Of energy, the stressfield of the
        dielectric, that is, its cohesive force or energy structure, is
        likewise H and Of energy, and the crossing of the two
        stressfields brings about permanent and complete electrification
        of the whole mass under treatment. </p>
      <p>It is what might be termed "occlusion", not as with gases and
        porous material, but "energy occlusion" made possible only by
        the plastic state in a slowly solidifying condition. </p>
      <p>Eguchi declares that such an electret shows so great an
        intensity of electrisation that the electric force exerted in
        front of the surface of the electret may attain the greatest
        sustainable value in the atmosphere -- the permanency being also
        so good that no sensible decay was detected for three or four
        years after its preparation. </p>
      <p>The maximum attainable surface densities by mechanical friction
        are: </p>

        Glass&nbsp; 2.65&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.90 </p>
      <p>Whereas the Permanent Electret has densities of the order of 6
        to 6.2 ESU and in air in front of the surface, 7 to 7.8 </p>
      <p>The actual surface density (d) of the free charge of an
        electret may be calculated from observed numbers as follows: </p>
      <p>C = Capacity of the condenser system, <br>
        V = Potential read on electrometer <br>
        R = effective radius of surface induction plate, i.e., radius of
        plate plus ½ of air gap; </p>
      <p>D = CV/ 3.14 r<sup>2</sup> </p>
      <p>For full details of the Eguchi Electret see, <i>Phil. Mag</i>.,
1925,
1,






        Vol. 49) </p>
      <p>Enough has been said to show that the electret is a fact
        established by actual experimentation, although here we are not
        concerned with the Eguchi electret, but merely with the
        principle involved and its significance, viz. the production of
        a <i>permanent magnet in the electrostatic sphere</i>. </p>
      <p>This principle forms the basis or nucleus for our spherical
        field. Schappeller has not used either Eguchi’s or any other
        form of known electret, and the purpose of citing Eguchi’s
        experiments is merely to establish beyond all doubt that this
        principle is a practical and proven fact. The composition and
        preparation of Schappeller’s electret or what he calls his
        "sublimate", requires a special plant and involves a continuous
        process of perhaps six weeks’ duration. Suffice it to say that
        the principle in the design of this new plant is "transpiration"
        or drawing energy from the ground by producing a stressfield
        above the ground and then binding it as an energy sublimate to a
        suitable "electret material" to form the permanent magnet for
        our new form of field. </p>
      <p>This plant, although worked out in detail, is entirely new and
        has no parallel in present Science; it is as important in the
        New technique as the cyclotron, or equivalent apparatus is in
        the attempt to obtain atomic force by the "splitting up" instead
        of the building up, of the atom from atomic potential in the
        free, unbound state, but with this difference, that once it has
        performed its part of producing the sublimate, it will never be
        required again, because the products can then be reproduced
        anywhere and everywhere as desired. </p>
      <p><b>Magnetism ~</b> </p>
      <p>We have already dealt with the origin of magnetism in the
        latent form, then polarized as vacuum or atomic force in the
        cosmos, and finally functioning as a sun or other variant. </p>
      <p>We have also examined the method by which magnetism is produced
        and utilized in electric generators of the present day, that is
        the solenoid and its core; the core is then said to be
        polarized, and each unit of such an apparatus is termed an
        electromagnet. If we place a small piece of steel in the
        neighborhood of the poles of such a magnet, when the solenoid is
        carrying the current, the steel will be attracted because the
        field around the end of the pole will be induced into the
        cohesive force of the steel and it will finally be held against
        the face of the core or magnet. </p>
      <p>Or we may consider a bar magnet which as only residual
        magnetism, the shape of the field being so well known that it
        need not be shown here. The bar is then said to be magnetized;
        the magnetism in the bar is polarized magnetism, the one pole,
        as we have seen previously, is hydrogen and the other oxygen
        energy; the neutral center is carbon energy, and the polarizer
        is carbon energy in the steel. </p>
      <p>Now there is a law in this kind of magnetism that <i>"magnetic
          lines of force are always closed"</i>. </p>
      <p>This means that each line of force has N and S, or H and O
        energy, and that the pull exerted is through a form of
        restricted mobile interchange; in other words, the field itself
        as such is neutral. But place a piece of steel in the field and
        the magnetism or static (mobile) interchange will cease and the
        N and S, or H and O energy, the two components of all magnetism,
        will once again be separated out as a polarization. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The shape of the field shows that due to compression in
        the metal it exerts a pressure outwards and also an attraction
        or pressure inwards, but only as a static field, not in the free
        form with true mobility. </p>
      <p>Suppose we could bring this magnetic field to the "glowing
        state"; we should then have mobility, breathing, transpiration,
        the Primary Force. But this is not possible. We require for this
        an entirely new form, and an entirely new condition of
        magnetism, and obviously therefore a new form of magnet. </p>
      <p>It will be clear at once that steel will not fulfill the
        required conditions for our new magnet. </p>
      <p>We can even venture on a further assertion and say that no
        substance exists which will satisfy the required conditions for
        the new form of magnet or magnetic field which is an essential
        of the New Technique, the purpose of which is to produce the
        Primary Force. </p>
      <p>Now there is polar and impolar magnetism, and we appear to
        require a modification, or perhaps more accurately expressed, a
        combination of the two. </p>
      <p>The three essentials to any magnet are two poles and a neutral.
        We require a uniform, coherent and concentrated magnetism and we
        refer now to the magnetism itself and not to the field producing
        it. This is the reason that no substance of any form could
        fulfill these conditions, which means that our magnet must
        therefore be throughout of magnetism; the two poles and the
        neutral must be centralized, united, in the form of the basic
        sign of all life force, the "trinity in unity". </p>
      <p>But to accomplish this artificially, that is, through
        apparatus, the form of apparatus must be polar and <i>the
          electric current must be polarized</i>. The electric current
        is self-produced in the Stator without the aid of any external
        generator, and is only required at all for stimulating a
        specially designed Rotor, not for driving it, and even then only
        when the Stator is required for the purpose of generating
        mechanical power in combination with the Rotor. </p>
      <p>The figures show the new form of magnetic field. </p>

      <p>Both are, of course, purely diagrammatic and only show the
        principle. Drawings are available at the end of this Part II,
        i.e.: </p>

        (2) A Scale sectional drawing through the whole Stator <br>
        (3) A Force diagram. </p>
      <p>There is no such thing as magnetism without the characteristic
        N, S and neutral, and here they meet... the trinity in unity </p>
      <p>So the Stator is a sphere formed in two parts --&nbsp; a top
        and bottom half or a north and south pole, both of which project
        into the interior of a free, hollow, central space; the diagrams
        represent the central hollow space of the Stator only, and not
        the outer covering. </p>
      <p>The whole of the space in <b><a href="#fig1-13">Figure 13</a></b>
        is filled with glowing magnetism when the Stator is in operation
        -- the glowing magnetism being simply the induced, highly
        compressed energy-material, exactly as is the case with a sun or
        other newly formed variant. </p>
      <p>We know from the PP that the origin of all heavenly bodies must
        be the Ether, being the one and only material available out of
        which cosmic bodies can be formed. The ether does not form a
        cosmic body; the cosmic body is formed out of the ether,
        technically perhaps a distinction without a difference, but
        basically one of great importance, because we are dealing here
        not with the dead or rather devitalized force of the electric
        current, but with the great biomagnetic static Primary Force. </p>
      <p>It is the conscious sense energy in the Ether which causes
        cosmic bodies to form and gives each of them their
        characteristic destiny to perform. </p>
      <p>It was explained in the earlier part of this book that the
        Ether is latent conscious energy; the core of a sun which is out
        of the Ether (being merely polarized highly compressed hydrogen
        component, but complete with its complementary oxygen
        stressfield) must also be "conscious" -- i.e., a living entity
        but not yet organic. </p>
      <p>There is only one ether material; it must therefore be the same
        ether which is finally formed to the glowing state as glowing
        magnetism; only the method by which this is brought about
        artificially differs. </p>
      <p>The northern half of the spherical glowing magnetism is
        stimulated as one pole and the southern half likewise as the
        other pole, therefore the diametric central surface is neutral.
        This trinity in unity can only exist in the pure energy state. </p>
      <p>Three candle flames can be merged into one, but the products of
        combustion would be externally ejected; only their energies
        remain within, separate, yet united. It may be said that ten
        candle flames can thus be merged into one, so why call it a
        "trinity"? </p>
      <p>Exactly so, but this is merely an additive process, not a basic
        law; the separate candle flames are in no way essential
        components of the whole. A single candle flame was just as
        complete, singly. Whereas the N and S poles and the neutral
        constitute the three basic components of magnetism, without
        which no polarized magnetism can exist. </p>
      <p>It may be asked, then, where is the neutral in thelatent
        magnetism of the ether? It has, however, previously been
        explained that the N and S poles are the H and Of components and
        that the neutral is the carbon before polarization and this is
        the unity in the trinity. </p>
      <p>Exactly the same exists here from this artificial polarization,
        the carbon neutral being, however, merely in this case a
        Euclidian diametric surface as homogeneity exists throughout. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that innumerable questions arise, which require
        an answer, but let us clear them up one by one without haste and
        thus without confusion. </p>
      <p>The study of "origin" requires not only immense patience and a
        restful mind cleared of prejudice, but also great tolerance,
        before it can be intelligently assimilated! </p>

      <hr width="62%">
      <p>The bare statement has been made that the glowing magnetism
        forms in the central hollow space of the Stator, which merely
        explains what this central space is for, and that in being the
        seat of the glowing magnetism it is the purpose for which the
        whole Stator is designed. </p>
      <p>The purpose for which a gun is designed, complex mechanism as
        it is, is nevertheless merely to fire a shell; and the purpose
        for which this new apparatus, the Stator, is designed is solely
        for the production and maintenance of a glowing magnetic core,
        which we now see is formed and maintained in this central hollow
        space. </p>
      <p>The questions arise, how and when is the glowing magnetism
        formed and maintained? We now know where this takes place. </p>
      <p>As we already know, the first essential to its formation is <i>to
produce
a






          point of inequality in the homogenous ether, in the geometric
          center of the hollow space, in order that a physical center
          may be formed.</i> </p>
      <p>But we have not the facilities of the Cosmos, and so we can
        only accomplish this by setting up a magnetic field which will
        concentrate a pressure on the center of the hollow space; but
        this must not, as we have seen, be a gauss field. </p>
      <p>The coils instead of being wires must be tubes, or if we prefer
        the term, tubular wires, as they are of very small diameter --
        perhaps of the order of ¼ inch. </p>
      <p>Of what substance should these coils of tubular wire or tubes
        be made? </p>
      <p>In this form of electromagnetism it may be said that a
        conductor is an insulator and that a dielectric field holds a
        charge, and in one sense for static electricity it is thus, as
        it were, a static conductor. So our wires or tubes would be made
        of copper... </p>
      <p>The drawings for the Rotor have also been worked out and the
        author is able to state that no further mechanical or electrical
        difficulty presented itself in the design of either of these two
        entirely separate units, which together constitute the complete
        Prime Mover for the production of mechanical power in the New
        Technique. Furthermore, the Stator, when suitably designed, can
        be used for the production of light and heat, of course without
        a Rotor (which later would obviously only be required when the
        purpose was the production of power), and likewise for many
        other purposes including radiology in the treatment of diseases,
        etc., etc. </p>
      <p>But hollow copper wires or tubes alone will not enable a
        suitable magnetic field to be produced. The purpose of hollow
        tubes is to fill them with a suitably chosen and suitably
        prepared combination of substances, the actual composition and
        preparation of which is Schappeller’s secret. It is the
        equivalent of Eguchi’s Electret, but whereas Eguchi’s Electret
        was in the nature merely of an experiment in Physics to
        establish a phenomenon or "effect", Schappeller’s sublimate is
        the outcome of experiment guided by immense original research
        relevant to the various specific purposes for which this
        sublimate is to be produced. </p>
      <p>The new plant for the production of his sublimate is entirely
        of his own design, based on a deep knowledge of the application
        of the laws of the Primary Physics, but presents no constructive
        or mechanical difficulties, and brings the production of the
        sublimate to a fine art. The general principles of the design of
        this plant and apparatus are known to the author, but it would
        not be legitimate for him to reveal them here, and it is
        furthermore unnecessary at this juncture. </p>
      <p>That a sublimate can be produced is a proven fact from the
        Eguchi experiments. </p>
      <p><b>Quality of Energy</b> </p>
      <p>Now before we leave the subject of the sublimate an important
        question arises: why will not any sublimate serve the purpose?
        This, in the New Technique opens up a large new field as yet
        entirely hidden from Science -- "quality of energy". </p>
      <p>Some scientists are trying to being to think in terms of
        quality of energy, but for them at present no such thing as
        quality of energy exists. </p>
      <p>As was pointed out in an earlier Chapter, the transformation of
        the sun’s electromagnetic radiation into light and heat on this
        earth does not mean that light and heat are different qualities
        of energy. How could they be, since they are from the same
        source. They are merely different conditions of electromagnetic
        radiation, the quality of which was characterized by the sun. </p>
      <p>We can have different qualities of coal gas, because it is
        merely a mechanical mixture suitable adjusted for various
        purposes -- light or heat; but there is no such thing as
        different qualities of steam -- saturated and superheated steam
        are different conditions, not different qualities, as both owe
        their origin to water. </p>
      <p>In the case of the electric current or a magnetic field derived
        fro it there is neither a change in quality nor of condition,
        only of form, e.g., DC or AC current and various forms of
        fields. </p>
      <p>To produce magnetic fields of different qualities we require a
        sublimate and the quality is, therefore, characterized by its
        specific composition; herein lies the immense importance of the
        sublimate, and that is why Schappeller has reduced this portion
        of the work to a highly developed art. In view of the evidence
        given of the Electret, there appears to be little reason to
        doubt that he can produce this in special forms to suit the
        innumerable conditions demanded in he application of his New
        Technique. </p>
      <p>The quality of energy required for mechanical power is
        obviously different from that required for specific purposes in
        radiology, although the radiation even from a power Stator would
        be generally beneficial to the human body, as both the Stator’s
        energy and that of the human body are biomagnetic. </p>
      <p>We are, however, at present simply concerned with the design of
        a Stator for the production of mechanical power. We will now
        assume that the correct composition of sublimate has been
        prepared; it is then forced into the two cols of tubing (that
        is, the tubing which is to constitute the N and S poles, or two
        halves of the Sphere or Stator) until the tubes are completely
        filled throughout. </p>
      <p>These tubes are now embedded in a suitable material of ceramic
        composition which, when it cools and solidifies, holds the two
        coils firmly in position. This ceramic material performs various
        functions; it holds the tubes in position, protects them,
        refines the ether radiation or induction into the center, and
        its inner periphery or surface presents a heat-resisting face to
        the glowing magnetism. It is also electrically an insulator. </p>
      <p><b>The Charging of the Sublimate</b> </p>
      <p>The sublimate must be charged with electric current, after
        which, provided no power is taken from it, it will retain its
        charge as we saw in the case of the Electret; the Sublimate in
        this case is an energy sublimate (produced by the new plant
        referred to above), but this sublimate is bound to a composition
        of substances in the solid form with which the tubular coils are
        tightly filled. </p>
      <p>The charging plant required is merely that necessary to give
        the required number of amperes, the plant being composed of the
        requisite generators and units, according to whether the grid
        current is available or an entirely different supply is
        required, or both as a "standby". Such plants will, of course,
        supply direct current. </p>
      <p><b>The Stator</b> </p>
      <p>A ceramic lining or casing is fixed on the inside of a steel
        casing, the whole being on two journals supported on trunnions.
      </p>
      <p>A lever with handle is connected to one side of the trunnion
        outside the journal, by means of which the Stator’s sphere can
        be tilted from the position of N-S vertical to the limiting
        angle required for the directional magnetic concentration of the
        Rotor, as we shall see later </p>
      <p><b>The Circuit</b> </p>
      <p>Starting from the top half of the Stator, the coil of tube
        containing the sublimate is fixed to the North Pole, finally
        emerging through the hollow axle on which the Sphere of the
        Stator is supported, the bottom half of the Sphere being
        similarly provided with a coil of tube attached to the South
        pole and emerging on the other side through the hollow axle. </p>
      <p>Wires (ordinary copper conducting wires) are connected to the
        two ends of the nests of tubes, after which they emerge through
        the hollow axle and are brought down to two terminals
        conveniently situated. These wires complete the circuit through
        the Rotor, which is mechanically an entirely separate unit,
        standing on its own base and at a specific calculated distance
        from the Stator; the Rotor is fixed to the shaft to be driven. </p>
      <p>The central terminal is for the "earthing connection" through a
        battery (needless to say, of special design and having no
        relation to any form of battery at present known to the SP
        [Secondary Physics]), and the Sphere is earthed through the
        battery -- the whole of this connection from the center terminal
        to the "earthing disc" itself being a tube filled with sublimate
        exactly similar to the tubes forming the Stator field. </p>
      <p>The disc or earthing plate is also of special design, according
        to the purpose to be served. </p>
      <p>The battery is not essential where the Stator is merely for the
        production of power, as it is really a refining apparatus --
        that is, for refining or qualifying the energy for each specific
        purpose to be served. </p>
      <p>A study of the <b>Schematic Diagram</b> and <b>Scale Drawing</b>
        of the Stator should now make this clear. </p>
      <p><b>The Rotor</b> </p>
      <p>This is really a steel wheel of special design fixed actually
        on the shaft to be driven... </p>
      <p>[The construction of the Rotor] consists of a steel wheel of
        special design with short spokes, and, finally, a periphery or
        rim in which in which there are magnets -- always an odd number,
        five or seven and so forth, to avoid the possibility of a dead
        center. </p>
      <p>This has been worked out in detail just like the Stator, but
        the author regrets that he has no drawing of the Rotor available
        at present. </p>
      <p>The body, spokes and part of the periphery, including of course
        the magnets, which later are also hollow, are entirely filled
        with sublimate and energized through the electric current, as
        shown in the <b>Schematic Diagram</b>. The moment the Stator is
        switched on. </p>
      <p><b>Switching On</b> </p>
      <p>What actually does "switching on" mean? </p>
      <p>It means "earthing" the Stator. In the "off" position the
        earthing connection D<sub>1</sub> is broken, the Stator or
        Sphere of the Stator being exactly n the N-S vertical. So
        switching on means pulling the lever provided on the Stator
        spindle and thereby taking the Sphere of the Stator off the
        neutral stud; the Sphere is then earthed through the connections
        shown and aired through the N pole at the top, which may even
        accumulate outside the Sphere in a cross filled with electret or
        sublimate material, or in a Sphere, in place of an ordinary
        screwed plug (See drawing of Stator). </p>
      <p>The complete theoretical energy cycle is shown in the <b>Schematic






          Diagram</b>. The dotted line represents the return to the
        earth, really a theoretical consideration. </p>
      <p>The position of the Rotor relatively to the Stator is the
        position of the reader when studying the drawing. If the reader
        pulled the lever towards him the N pole would finally point
        exactly to his eyes. Imagine that his eyes are a magnet just
        appearing over the top of the Rotor periphery. The Stator in
        this position will be exerting its maximum force on the Rotor,
        because half the core is concentrated on the Rotor. </p>
      <p>The Rotor will be set with its axis, that is, the axis of the
        shaft to be driven, parallel to the axis of the Stator shaft
        through the trunnion, and at any convenient distance within the
        Stator’s amplitude’ Schappeller declares that a suitable
        distance between the shaft of the Stator and that of the Rotor
        is seven times the outside diameter of the Stator (7d). </p>

      <p><b>Force Exerted by Stator on Rotor</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the <b>Force Diagram</b>, the dot and dash
        line XX represents the center line (in a horizontal plane) of
        the Sphere of the Stator through the journals and trunnion. The
        line (dot and dash) YY is the center line through the Stator
        Sphere and the center line of the peripheral circle of magnets,
        tangential to the radius of the Rotor at this circle. </p>
      <p>The distance between center of Sphere and center of magnet
        appearing on periphery will bar a definite proportion to the
        angle at which the lever is placed with relationship to the YY
        axis. </p>
      <p>Line A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> represents pull for lever at 10
        degrees <br>
        Line A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub> represents pull for lever at 30
        degrees <br>
        Line AB represents pull for lever for maximum position </p>
      <p>The above, of course, are the rectangular projections of the N
        pole, or a graphic representation of the useful component of
        force directionally available for exerting a pull on the Rotor.
      </p>
      <p>The Z line is the position of the lever for maximum force. </p>
      <p>The Rotor for the first demonstration has been designed for 15
        HP only, but with the present Stator dimensions, so that
        enormous surplus power is available. </p>
      <p>There will be a demagnetizing or "braking" effect on that
        portion of the pole not in mobile exchange with the Rotor, which
        at AB max. will be zero, at A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>
        (corresponding to a lever position in the diagram of 30 degrees)
        is represented by the smaller area and sloping section lines,
        and at A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> (for lever at 10 degrees) is
        represented by the larger area shown by vertical section lines.
        The value of these two braking effects is represented by the
        projection of B<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>
        respectively, to the limiting lines A<sub>0</sub>. </p>
      <p>This theoretical diagram would be modified when set out for any
        actual Prime Mover: </p>
      <p>(a) by the relative positions of the Stator and Rotor; <br>
        (b) by the diameter of the Rotor magnet, represented here as a
        point. </p>
      <p>Let us now obtain through calculation some impression of the
        maximum directional force exerted by the Stator. We must
        remember that this is not "steel magnetism", but magnetism from
        a glowing core in the primary state, for which the laws of
        magnetism will be modified. </p>
      <p>Coulomb’s law F = k (m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup>)
        is not a convenient form to make the first calculation; we will
        therefore use the form F = B<sup>2</sup>A/8 pi. </p>
      <p>Now, if we are, with this form of primary magnetism, within the
        amplitude at 7d, it is legitimate to make a preliminary
        calculation based on this formula, if only to demonstrate the
        principle on which the force is exerted. </p>
      <p>Remember, in this connection, that here it is the electricity
        that is stationary and magnetism that is radiated, as we shall
        see shortly when we examine the functioning of the whole Stator
        and Rotor. </p>
      <p>The next consideration is the introduction of the Schappeller
        constant. </p>
      <p>He derives this on the principle that water is to air as 1000:1
        (as weight or density), and that air is to atmosphere (as
        stressfield) as at lest the same, 1000:1. Therefore the
        expansive power of the ether is at least 1000 times that of air
        and likewise of a present gauss field, whose expansive power as
        a field is negligible, relatively. In other words, the capacity
        of the ether for stimulation as a stressfield, for all practical
        purposes, is infinite, and the force inducing ether stimulation
        has its seat or origin in the magnetic-heat potential, e.g., the
        sun’s magnetic-heat potential and its infinite stressfield. </p>
      <p>So Schappeller takes as his constant that this primary
        magnetism is 1000 times more powerful than a magnetic field of
        present magnetism -- a gauss field -- which, when the full
        significance of a primary stressfield and its origin-force has
        been assimilated, may be regarded as quite a moderate figure. </p>
      <p>It may be said that the field from the earth’s core, which is,
        of course, also glowing magnetism, is only 981 -- yes, but I we
        take the present estimate of the core at 2000 miles radius, this
        flux of 981 is for a distance of 2000 miles. </p>
      <p><b>Calculations on the Stator</b> </p>
      <p>Given a Stator Sphere of 15 cm diameter, what HP is available?
      </p>
      <p>Take B for steel at a flux density of 15,000 gauss (Maxwells
        per cm2). <br>
        A = surface area of Sphere = say, 600 cm<sup>2</sup>. Then: </p>
      <p>F = B<sup>2</sup>A/8 pi = 15000<sup>2</sup> x 600/8 pi = 225 x
        10<sup>6</sup> dynes x 600 cm<sup>2</sup>/25 x 981 x 1000 = 5400
        kilos pull exerted just outside the surface of the Sphere. </p>
      <p>But we must now introduce Schappeller’s constant 1000. The
        author halves this again and calls it 500 -- a very low figure.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, Pull = 2,700,000 kilos, but only half of the Sphere
        is directly or directionally active. Therefore, Pull = 1,300,000
        kilos, says, 50% efficiency between field of Stator and field of
        Rotor -- loss due to slip, not heat (See Chap. XXIV, p. 172,
        para. 2). Thus, Pull = 675,000 kilos </p>
      <p>Take this as operating at 1 meter/second, and we have 67500/75
        = 9000 HP, which is the same figure as that which we obtained
        from the Mathias value of lightning-material (See Chapter on
        Lightning). </p>
      <p>Now, Physics tells us that the earth’s field varies as the
        square of the distance from the center of the earth, but that
        the earth’s core probably has a radius of 2000 miles. Therefore
        the crust is 2000 miles thick. </p>
      <p>The PP establishes the earth’s core as glowing magnetism;
        therefore this 981 is at 2000 miles. </p>
      <p>But 77 miles is about the 26th part of 2000 miles, and the
        square of 26 is approximately: </p>
      <p>680 x 981 = 675,000 approx. </p>
      <p>Therefore, on this calculation the earth’s field would have an
        equivalent or exert an equivalent pull to that exerted by our
        Stator at 77 miles from its core periphery. </p>
      <p>If we make the calculation from the geometric center of the
        earth on a radius of 4000 miles, instead of 77 miles we should
        have, say, 150 as the equivalent distance for the earth’s core
        to exert 675,000 dynes per square cm., which, as the core itself
        is 2000 miles radius, is reductio ad absurdum. This shows that
        we are well within the estimate for the force exerted by primary
        magnetism from a glowing core. </p>
      <p>The earth’s field is, of course, vastly greater than that of
        our Stator, so much greater that on this calculation it has a
        magnetic field at 77 miles from its core periphery equivalent to
        the field produced by our little Sphere at a distance of, say,
        one meter from the Stator core. </p>
      <p>The actual pull exerted on a magnet on the Rotor periphery
        depends on the intensity of stimulation given to the Rotor
        magnets, and may, for the examination of the principles, be
        represented by </p>
      <p>F = k (m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup>) </p>
      <p>Where m<sub>1</sub> is the Stator field and m2 the field of any
        given Rotor magnet. </p>
      <p>As regards the actual power transferred to the Rotor, we have
        three adjustments available: </p>
      <p>(1) The strength of the Stator field, which must have a minimum
        strength sufficient to bring the Ether concentration to the
        glowing state. </p>
      <p>(2) The resulting pull exerted on the Rotor, according to the
        position of the lever as shown in the Force Diagram. </p>
      <p>(3) The stimulation given to the Rotor magnets through the
        electric current generated in the Stator. This will be direct
        current, the strength of which can, of course, be entirely
        controlled through the present known means. </p>
      <p>It will be obvious that more data is required to make the
        actual calculation, e.g., a "constant of stimulation" will have
        to be introduced depending on the composition of the secret
        sublimates, and there are other considerations. </p>
      <p>But let us now again make a calculation of the available HP
        from the Stator, but on quite a different basis. We mentioned in
        one of the earlier chapters that this might bear some
        relationship to Electrochemical Equivalents. </p>
      <p>Now with electrolytic action: </p>
      <p>1 amp deposits 0.329 mgm of copper per second <br>
        3 amps deposit 1.00 mg copper/sec. <br>
        Now each 8.9 gm copper occupies 1 cm<sup>3</sup> <br>
        But 1 liter -- 1 dcm<sup>3</sup> = 1000 cm<sup>3</sup> <br>
        There are thus, say, 9000 gm Cu in 1 liter. So in a1 liter
        Stator we have 9000 gm Cu or 3 x 1000 x 9000 = 27 x 10<sup>6</sup>
        amps. </p>
      <p>Assume 1 volt and 27 x 10<sup>6</sup> / 746 = 36000 HP </p>
      <p>But maximum available at 50% for half the Sphere is 9000 HP, as
        was obtained in the last case by the Mathias figure (See Chapter
        on Lightning). This must be regarded as taking place within a
        second, because the deposition figure is per second per ampere;
        this energy is, however, instantly available. </p>
      <p>It should nevertheless be realized that this is an
        energy-capacity measurement, whereas the resulting stressfield
        is per unit surface, a surface measurement. The capacity
        measurement is "indication" and thus we cannot multiply by the
        Schappeller factor here. </p>
      <p>Now, it may be said that 1volt would not bring the Ether to a
        glowing state, which is perfectly true, although this will be
        made clearer shortly. </p>
      <p>In the energy form or state we may assume a high "transference
        or conversion efficiency". The commercial efficiency is, of
        course, about 100%, because the fuel costs nothing and is
        inexhaustible. </p>
      <p>The earth, a has been previously explained, is the storehouse
        of energy, which energy is available to replenish continuously
        the Stator Field as and when the Rotor draws energy from the
        Stator through the medium of the energy cycle. </p>
      <p>Electropy then ensues promoting continuous induction of the
        Ether towards the center, just as it takes place in the sun
        through the induction of its complementary stressfield; but
        here, through the pressure exerted on the hollow center of the
        Stator due to the intensity of the Electret or sublimate field.
      </p>
      <p>It was explained in the Chapter on the Electric Current that
        amps are merely densified volts, and this must be so because an
        inspection of the basic formula or Ohm’s law sows that power is
        obtainable from any given electric current in direct proportion
        to the product of volts and amps, volts representing the stress
        or energy potential, and amps per unit of time being the
        quantity -- the actual unit being the Coulomb. </p>
      <p>The best illustration of this in the electrotechnique of the
        present day is perhaps the transformer, which actually converts
        volts into amps, or vice versa. It follows that what we are
        doing here is merely to convert volts into amps. </p>
      <p>The volts in the sublimate through electrization constitute the
        static electric field, which field is constantly concentrating
        its energy onto the center point of the Sphere and densifiying,
        or sublimating, because amps are really a sublimation out of an
        electric stressfield produced artificially by compression of the
        cohesive force in the space-form of a wire. </p>
      <p>In the present electrotechnique volts are densified to amps
        through compression in a wire, the denser amps requiring a
        larger section for their accommodation, that is, the sublimate,
        being energy-material, requires more space than the stressfield
        from which it originated, hence the larger section required in
        the secondary winding of a transformer in "stepping down". </p>
      <p>In the New Technique all this takes place in the free state,
        through compression on a center, till densification and ignition
        and we then really have amps as the glowing core surrounded by
        its complementary volt-stressfield which together, in this form,
        constitute the true atomic or Vacuum Force. </p>
      <p>But we saw in our previous calculations that the Stator had a
        calculated capacity of 36,000 HP or an effective maximum
        capacity of 9000 HP. </p>
      <p>Let us now work backwards; assuming that the full capacity of
        the Sphere is used, which it never would be, because of
        engineering considerations, the Stator must be capable of 36,000
        HP continuously. </p>
      <p>The primary static charge on the field must be only of such
        capacity that it will occasion induction of the Ether and in the
        initial stage cause implosion, and afterward sustain this
        densified Ether in the glowing state to the capacity of the load
        when connected between the PD earth-atmospheric stressfield. </p>
      <p>But if the Stator is to be loaded to its full capacity, which
        we have seen is calculated for practical purposes as 9000 HP
        (effective), then 36000 HP of energy must be drawn from the
        earth. </p>
      <p>Now let X = the amps charge required by the field; then </p>
      <p>500 x X x 100 / 746 x 9000 = 135 amps at 100 volts, </p>
      <p>or let us say 13,500 watts, which is converted into glowing
        energy 500 times as powerful (taking a value of half of
        Schappeller’s constant). </p>
      <p>This really signifies that the Stator field must be able to
        hold and transfer 13,500 watts per minute, which, as has been
        explained, is actually supplied or drawn up from the earth
        through the earthing connection shown in the drawing and
        diagram. The voltage required for the charge is only that
        necessary to impress the charge into the sublimate. </p>
      <p>After electropy has taken place there are, speaking the
        language of the present elelctrotechnique, no volts in the
        actual core, as they are densified to amps. Hence we say 1 volt
        for purposes of calculation. </p>
      <p>Thus the capacity of the field in any given design depends on:
      </p>
      <p>(1) The rate at which power is to be drawn; <br>
        (2) The total effective area of the nest of tubes, which may
        have three or four rows, arranged concentrically as one
        continuous field. </p>
      <p>The designs and drawings which have already been prepared are
        actually for a 15 HP Prime Mover, the Stator being odthe
        dimensions given in the calculation. So that instead of
        supplying 9000 HP it has in the first demonstration only to
        supply 15 HP. </p>
      <p>The above calculations are thus only intended to show the
        function which this type of field has to perform. </p>
      <p>The 15 cm Stator is about the smallest that is mechanically
        practical to produce. </p>
      <p>Here, it should perhaps be made clear that the cost of a
        complete Prime Mover (Stator and Rotor) is negligible. The main
        cost of demonstrating the application to mechanical power lies
        in the purchase of the charging plants and standby sets, which
        later are absolutely necessary for certain reasons, and also
        Schappeller’s special plant for the production of the initial
        sublimate by occasioning transpiration, followed by condensation
        and sublimation, all in the energy form. </p>
      <p>Let it therefore be clearly understood that any suggestion of
        small laboratory models or the like is out of the question or
        they would obviously have been used and the application of the
        Primary Force to mechanical power would long since have been
        tested out. The transpiration could not be produced by models
        and the essential sublimate could not therefore be produced
        except by a plant of certain minimum dimensions capable of
        producing transpiration, and this also applies to the Stator and
        Rotor which is obvious here when the design of the Stator is
        carefully examined. </p>
      <p><b>The Functioning of the New Prime Mover</b> </p>
      <p>From a careful study of the Force Diagram it may be said that a
        very small initial movement of the lever represents an
        inconceivably large "available force", but the diagram also
        shows, in relation to this, that the "braking effect" at small
        angles of movement of the lever is much greater than at larger
        angles, as shown by the cross-hatched and hatched areas; and if
        the two units (Stator and Rotor) of the Prime Mover are
        carefully designed, and set for the average and maximum loads
        required in each case where such Prime Movers&nbsp; are to be
        installed, the "graduation curve of force" relative to lever
        angles can be favorable, within the ranges of power required in
        each particular case. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It will thus be seen that there is a characteristic curve
        for this, just as there is for every motor or generator in the
        present electrotechnique; or it is perhaps the equivalent of the
        Zeuner diagrams for reciprocating steam engines. </p>
      <p>For the moment, however, we are not concerned here so much with
        the design as with the actual functioning of the Prime Mover. </p>
      <p>We have seen that whichever way we make our preliminary
        calculations for estimating the power available, the power
        exerted on the Rotor is in the form of a pull as between the
        poles of two magnets. It is, however, from the mechanical
        engineer’s standpoint, somewhat doubtful whether this force
        exerted as described here would prove to be an entirely
        satisfactory method of producing mechanical power, but happily
        this point is of little or no importance, as it is not the way
        in which the rotary motion is produced. The pull exerted on the
        Rotor magnets gives the Rotor periphery its directional motion,
        but the motion is afterwards sustained or maintained by the
        crossing of two stressfields, i.e., the Stator stressfield
        crossing the stressfield of the Rotor -- the means by which the
        earth gives the sun its rotation on its axis. In other words, it
        sets up a condition of dynamic balance, or an equilibrium which
        can only be satisfied by producing the requisite motion. </p>
      <p>The sun is a product of the earth’s stressfield and is thus
        biomagnetically characterized by it and to it. </p>
      <p>Likewise, in the case of the Stator and Rotor, the Rotor being
        energized entirely -- both qualitatively and quantitatively --
        by the Stator, rotary motion is imparted and maintained in the
        Rotor provided always that directional pull has been given, and
        here it is also sustained, i.e., the direct pull on the magnet.
      </p>
      <p>In the case of the earth and sun we have motion imparted and
        sustained in the latter’s core of glowing magnetism, which is
        crossed -- and thus energized and characterized -- by the
        earth’s stressfield, whereas with the Stator and the Rotor we
        have artificially not exactly a similar, but an equivalent
        condition, viz., we have set up in a Rotor an energized field
        stimulated and characterized for a given Stator, but here, since
        the Rotor field is in the cold condition and the Stator field,
        although exactly similar in quality, is in the glowing or hot
        condition (energy form), a magnetic-heat potential exists
        between the two units of the Prime Mover. </p>
      <p>This is a striking example of the Schappeller discovery shown
        graphically in the first of his symbols in Chapter VII, viz.,
        magnetism and heat as one, which does not exist in the present
        Physics, that is, magnetism with heat-potential, the source of
        the greatest force which exists in Nature. </p>

      <p>It is for this reason that the whole body of the Rotor with its
        spokes, in addition to the actual magnets, is filled with
        sublimate and energized through an electric current generated
        directly in the Stator itself. Directional pull is then given
        directly on the peripheral magnets and the whole energized Rotor
        is then cutting lines of force at a speed determined by the
        magnetic-heat potential and the load, adjustable as follows: </p>
      <p>(1) By the strength of the current supplied to the Rotor
        sublimate being variable as in the present electrotechnique. </p>
      <p>(2) By the Stator field heat-potential which, according to
        Schappeller, may be of the order of 50-300° C, whereas the Ether
        or cold latent magnetism will always be constant, probably as
        low as -270° (more or less) even near the earth’ surface. The
        intensity of the field and heat-potential will vary with the
        initial charge given to the sublimate. </p>
      <p>(3) By moving the Stator lever and thus altering the angle of
        the N-S poles in the Stator Sphere with relation to the rotary
        periphery. </p>
      <p>(4) By adjusting the relative positions of the Stator and
        Rotor. Stator N-S line need not be vertical when on the neutral
        position. </p>
      <p>The Rotor is laminated to prevent eddying and the magnets do
        not project; the Rotor periphery is thus entirely equiradial.
        The Rotor is fixed to the shaft to be driven and the Stator is
        fixed about a meter above the earth’s surface. This latter is,
        of course, flexible because the earth can include the sea or
        even the floor of an ether-ship. </p>
      <p>From one standpoint the Stator may be regarded as a body in
        Space. The concentration of the ether or latent magnetism takes
        place over the entire surface of the Sphere, in the same way as
        in the case of the Earth itself. It represents as it were a
        "power-field" concentrating on the central point of the Sphere.
        But actual concentration will take place only if and when a
        potential difference exists between the density in the latent
        magnetism outside and inside the Sphere cavity, which again will
        depend on the existence of a heat potential. </p>
      <p>When the Sphere cavity is full of air the ether density will be
        balanced, and this is, of course, the position when the lever is
        first pushed off the stop or neutral position. </p>
      <p>A power field therefore exists outside the cavity (or hollow
        center of the Stator Sphere) which is ever ready to concentrate
        with tremendous energy or atomic pressure at the center point of
        the cavity the moment a heat-potential exists or is produced. </p>
      <p>Now the instant the lever is pushed off the neutral point the
        Stator Sphere is polarized, or possesses an N and S pole
        although the N and S line may only be a few degrees out of the
        vertical neutral position. The Force Diagram s set out for the
        vertical at the "neutral position" but it need not be. </p>
      <p>The field is energized the moment the Stator is switched on.
        The ether balance inside and outside is no longer stable;
        pressure due to the field is exerted on the center of the
        cavity, and&nbsp; stream of cold latent magnetism (or ether)
        flows from the N to the S pole, the only pathway at present
        available as the air is still in the cavity. </p>
      <p>An aver-increasing pressure from the field concentrates on the
        center and the air (which is merely a sublimate out of the
        ether) is disintegrated; that is, the nitrogen and residue (the
        noble gases) are reconverted into the energy form as hydrogen,
        and the oxygen to oxygen energy; in other words, the whole is
        reconverted into ether and concentrated. </p>
      <p>The now powerful concentration of the field on the center of
        the cavity, after removing the air, induces an inrush of ether
        through the entire surface of the Sphere, resulting in a
        tremendous concentration of ether in the cavity. The pressure
        increases until finally the whole ether mass reaches a density
        corresponding to a critical temperature above which this
        densified ether enters into the glowing state and a powerful
        heat-potential is established. </p>
      <p>But it will be clearly understood by now that this is not
        merely heat-potential such as operates a thermodynamic cycle,
        but a magnetic heat-potential due to magnetism as densified in
        the glowing state. </p>
      <p>In the Chapter on the Electric Current the formula Current =
        gauss/0 was given as being the equivalent of Ohm’s law for the
        production of electromagnetism by the new Primary Technique, and
        the significance of the factors in this formula can now be
        understood. </p>
      <p>C = gauss (vacuum)/0 </p>
      <p>C = current, but current as such does not exist in the Primary
        technique because, as we know, here the electricity is static
        and the magnetism moves -- hence the term <i>dynomagnetism</i>.
      </p>
      <p>C in the Primary Technique thus signifies not current as such,
        but its static potential, viz. densified volts or amps. </p>
      <p>As has been explained, the BEMF is lifted and becomes the
        surrounding stress designated in the formula as the field under
        the term gauss. Here, however, this does not mean merely the
        field produced by the sublimate as such, but rather the
        complementary other half of the glowing magnetic core or ether
        concentration as volts. The two, i.e., glowing core (amps) and
        complementary stressfield (volts) constitute (as in the case of
        the sun and its complementary stressfield) a primary vacuum --
        hence the word vacuum in brackets next to gauss. </p>
      <p>Now this concentration of the stressfield is virtually on one
        point, which produces and sustains a physical center. </p>
      <p>The Euclidian definition of a point is that it has no
        magnitude, so mathematically its dimensions are zero or 0, and C
        is therefore (theoretically) infinity. </p>
      <p>The reason that it is not actually infinity is because of the
        limitations of "form" due to the construction of the apparatus.
        The sun’s resultant magnetic field is so vast that it may be
        termed for all practical purposes infinite in extent. </p>
      <p>We have thus constructed artificially an apparatus which will
        set up the conditions in which Primary vacuum will form and be
        maintained, or, speaking technically, an artificial sun and its
        surrounding stressfield. This is the biomagnetic static force,
        the atomic force, for which scientists are researching, but in
        its free original state as a potential difference by the
        building up of the atom, instead of endeavoring to obtain this
        force in its secondary form, where it appears as Cohesive Force
        in material, and then attempting to split it up, when it is
        neither collectible nor biomagnetic but devitalized. </p>
      <p>It should be clearly understood that it is impossible for any
        apparatus to produce glowing magnetism, just as it is impossible
        for any kettle or boiler to produce steam; such apparatus can
        only be constructed to bring about the conditions in which these
        phenomena will obtain. In purely colloquial language it is, of
        course, exactly the same thing, but speaking strictly
        scientifically it is very important to keep this clearly in our
        minds. </p>
      <p>But to continue with the Technique. This glowing magnetism in
        the central cavity has not merely enormous suction force, in
        that the surrounding ether concentration is induced into it
        through and by the powerful field concentration on the center
        point, but it acts as a catalyst, that is, it catalyzes the
        carbon energy static (the Ether) and compresses it; the reaction
        must therefore be the opposite -- expansion -- and it is thus
        radiating it out as a stimulated (instead of latent) H and Of
        power field, or true bioelectromagnetic radiation or stress. </p>
      <p>It draws between the potential difference earth-atmosphere (as
        a stressfield) -- this is the PD -- but the reservoir of energy
        from which it draws is the biomagnetic saturation of the earth
        (H and O energy) which the earth derives from its central core,
        hence the imaginary doted line in the <b>Schematic Diagram</b>
        showing the return of the fundamental energy cycle to the
        earth’s central core, in principle. </p>
      <p>The actual suction exerted is to supply the energy taken from
        the Sphere by whatever load is being carried (the load need not
        necessarily be mechanical power -- it may be reproduction of
        primary light or heat, curative radiation, or the production of
        one of the essential elements, or for various other purposes) is
        drawn up through the earthing tube as dynomagnetism, and this
        energy travels up this tube into the Stator field on the
        "energized sublimate" and is then projected out of the spherical
        field by Electropy, due to the central pull exerted on the
        spherical field by the physical center or core caused by the
        load. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The suction exerted by the glowing magnetism through the
        field could only draw energy up on energy, that is, on an
        energized sublimate, and then only if the Stator constitutes a
        physical link between the magnetic potential difference
        occasioned by magnetism bound (as in the earth’s crust) and in
        the free state as ether or the surrounding earth’s atmosphere --
        thus operating the Primary Cycle. </p>
      <p>Bu this action, followed by the reverse, this
        "energy-breathing" or transpiration occasioned by mobility (as
        we saw in the case of the sun) does not happen simply because it
        does. </p>
      <p>It is ordered, disciplined, and in fact occasioned by entropy.
      </p>
      <p>In that instant when the concentration of magnetism is brought
        to the glowing state the energy spiral or entropy spiral starts
        functioning up and down the Stator windings, and, of course,
        always in one sense and with a high frequency which Schappeller
        declares is probably of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> cycles per
        second. </p>
      <p>This entropy spiral is always present in that instant when
        mobility obtains sue to a glowing core functioning in a
        fundamental PD -- and here we have produced these essential
        conditions artificially through apparatus, the classic example
        previously given being the sun or any cosmic variant. </p>
      <p>It may be said that frequencies in the radio technique of today
        are far higher, but the work performed in one cycle is very much
        less. In the Primary Technique the concentrated stressfield is
        drawn in, catalyzed, and forced out in one cycle as a
        stressfield. </p>
      <p>This stressfield, or radiating magnetic stressfield, is
        available as an attractive or repulsive force for the production
        of mechanical power if a complementary unit of the Stator, that
        is, a suitably designed Rotor or mechanical appliance (to be
        driven) itself contains a like substance, upon which magnetism
        produced in this atomic state, or energy form, can react -- the
        whole, that is the two separate and complementary units, viz.,
        Stator and Rotor, constituting a single Prime Mover, as has
        already been explained. </p>
      <p><b>The Force Exerted on the Stator</b> </p>
      <p>Let us now consider what reaction must be supported or
        sustained by the Stator where mechanical power is being produced
        in its complementary unit, the Rotor. </p>
      <p>The figure for directional pull, according to our calculations,
        was 675,000 kilos -- the maximum effective power obtainable from
        a Prime Mover of this size, but which would never be used in
        practice. </p>
      <p>Obviously, as can be seen from the drawing, the Stator would be
        bolted down and presumably these bolts would have to take the
        reaction arising from the attraction exerted on the peripheral
        Rotor magnets of 675,000 kilos. But mysterious as it may sound,
        the casting and bolts of the Stator would experience no reaction
        whatever although the same law holds here, viz., that wherever
        there is an action there must be an equal and opposite reaction.
        In this case, however, the action arises not between magnetism
        bound to two opposing pieces of steel, in which the two pieces
        of steel will experience the action and reaction, that is, for
        example, the Stator of an induction motor of the field magnets
        and yoke of a DC motor which take the torque reaction exerted on
        the Rotor, or armature, respectively. </p>
      <p>Here the action arises from the force of attraction exerted by
        a free mass of glowing magnetic energy bound to no material
        whatever; the reaction therefore will be upon the glowing
        magnetic core as such, which in its turn will be taken by the
        complementary stressfield. In other words, the reaction of the
        pull exerted on the Rotor magnets will be taken on the ether
        concentration arising from the Stator core. </p>
      <p>Now consider the reaction on the Rotor. Here, as regards this
        force, we have similar conditions to those in electric motors of
        the present day, because the energized sublimate on which the
        pull is exerted is within or embedded in the steel Rotor casting
        and the pull will thus be transferred to the casting and thence
        to the shaft to be driven, and of course will be proportional to
        the speed and load. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that in every case the Stator would be firmly
        bolted down for stability, but not in order to take the
        reaction. The important engineering consideration here is that
        the casting would not have to be designed to take this stress. </p>
      <p><b>Fatigue of Metal</b> </p>
      <p>The steel casting of the Stator would, however, experience
        fatigue with time, due to the primary flux and, allowing a
        suitable factor of safety, warship engines, for example, might
        be renewed say every eight to ten years -- not a serious
        consideration, since engines or propelling machinery would then
        consist merely of Stators and Rotors, and the Rotors would not
        experience anything like the same fatigue. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, with the introduction of the Primary Force new
        forms of instruments would be available for every kind of
        measurement, including this form of "metal fatigue". </p>
      <p><b>Temperature of the Stator</b> </p>
      <p>At first sight it might be thought that the production of an
        "artificial sun" or glowing magnetism core would involve with it
        the inevitable production of enormous temperatures, and although
        this has already been dealt with, a few words here in the
        Technique may not be out of place. </p>
      <p>Temperature is a word that we are accustomed to use when we
        wish to express the intensity of heat, whereas a calorie is a
        unit expressing quantity of heat, rather perhaps the equivalent
        in electrotechnique of volts and amps. But heat expressing both
        the above measurements is a phenomenon which is associated with
        air.&nbsp; There is no air in the Stator. If the stem of a
        thermoelectric pyrometer were allowed to project into the Sphere
        cavity, the terrific compression and densification brought about
        when the Stator was switched on would cause it to disintegrate
        and disappear; no material of any kind could exist, as such, in
        a glowing core. So, the light-material produced in the Stator
        (as in the sun) is the product, not of temperature, but of
        compression through densification. </p>
      <p>This glowing core is the densest material that can exist, for
        two definite reasons: </p>
      <p>(a) because it is all energy-material and there are no
        interstices; </p>
      <p>(b) because this primary magnetic material is not merely under
        exterior compression but is itself the cause of this
        compression, since every particle of this energy exerts
        attraction on every other particle and towards a common center.
      </p>
      <p>In compressing or exerting compression upon itself it is "doing
        work" only upon itself; there is neither air nor a material
        (gaseous, liquid or solid) within the core which could absorb,
        transmit, reflect or convert this energy into heat. </p>
      <p>But the periphery of the core contacts with the special inner
        lining -- a suitable ceramic -- of the Stator Sphere, and this
        peripheral or surface energy will be converted into heat, but on
        a relatively very moderate scale. Schappeller gives this figure
        at between 50-300° C., according to the density required,
        whereas the periphery of the steel Sphere casing would be much
        less than this (See Chapter XXIV, p. 172, para. 2). </p>
      <p><b>The Arrangement of the Plant for Power Production</b> </p>
      <p>Let us first consider the problem as applied to marine
        propulsion. Given a single propeller shaft to transmit, say 8000
        HP, we should not use one Sphere but perhaps eight, distributed
        on each side of the shaft, or any convenient number to give a
        rational compromise between a good characteristic curve and a
        well-distributed torque on the shaft, the propeller shaft being
        provided with an equal number of Rotors. </p>
      <p><b>The Universal Transmission of Electromagnetic Power</b> </p>
      <p>This title expresses the dream or final goal of the great
        physicist Nikola Tesla (about 1905). In his British Patent No.
        8200, he claims to have devised apparatus capable of generating
        "electrical disturbances" not only approximating to, but even
        surpassing those of lightning; and he further claims to have
        reproduced by the aid of such apparatus the phenomenon of
        "stationary waves" on the earth. Or World-waves. By means of
        such waves he professed to transmit electrical power without the
        employment of cables. </p>
      <p>This dream is now within the reach of Science through the new
        Primary Technique. </p>
      <p>Let us compare the principles of Nikola Tesla and the present
        radio-technique with that of the work of Karl Schappeller. </p>
      <p>The whole of modern radio-technique depends on making a
        disturbance in the ether through the generation of electrical
        resonance. </p>
      <p>During a thunderstorm Tesla noted that the earth appeared to
        behave, despite its vast extent, like a conductor of limited
        dimensions. </p>
      <p>He suggested that the wholesale distribution of electrical
        energy might be possible by means of stationary waves on the
        earth’s surface, using the entire world as a conductor. </p>
      <p>So whilst Tesla regarded the earth merely as a conductor,
        Schappeller discovered that it was the obvious source and
        storehouse of all available energy, in addition to being a
        conductor. </p>
      <p>Tesla’s discovery was of a secondary nature and led him to
        produce and transmit power by causing a disturbance in the ether
        through wave propagation by resonance, in which the earth
        functioned merely as a conductor. </p>
      <p>Nearly 40 years have elapsed but it is still not feasible to
        transmit power as such on the Tesla system [ed.: only because of
        industrial politics], although the radio-technique has been
        developed with great success. </p>
      <p>Schappeller has always regarded the "causing of a disturbance
        in the Ether" for the purpose of transmitting power on a large
        scale as neither feasible nor desirable, and even for small
        powers, such a are used in the radio-technique, he regarded it
        as an "invert method". </p>
      <p>The Cosmos itself functions, as we have seen, by stressfield on
        stressfield or vacuum on vacuum. </p>
      <p>The secret for the transmission of power on a large scale over
        considerable distances lies in the rhythmical stimulation of the
        Ether membrane, of like kind, rather than a disturbance produced
        by an entirely artificial propagation of what, at present, is
        termed "wave formation". </p>
      <p>The production of a spark is a disruption, whereas the
        formation of a sun or other variant is not, because the latter
        is the orderly or disciplined formation of a sublimate out of
        one of the ether components itself, through polarization --
        Nature’s universal method. </p>
      <p>Again, resonance is a disturbance; a power or biomagnetic
        stressfield is not. On the contrary, it is a stimulation which
        can be utilized through the New Technique for power
        transmission, telegraphy, telephony, television, production of
        light and heat, sublimation in place of transmutation of metals,
        and in the curative applications already cited -- and all these
        in a manner far in advance of that made possible by the highest
        and latest developments of the techniques based on the Secondary
        Physics. </p>
      <p>Schappeller, in principle, cannot be wrong in this because it
        is the method by which Nature herself operates in the Cosmos,
        and the only method available to her. </p>
      <p>So magnetism is radiated which, from the physiological point of
        view, is not merely harmless but actually beneficial and
        stimulating to desirable forms of life (a subject dealt with in
        the medical Section). </p>
      <p>The transmission of great power is accomplished by the
        installation of Power Centrals, that is, Stators of larger
        dimensions designed for transmission of energy to the thousands
        of power or telephone (new form) Stators throughout a given
        district -- the equivalent of the present transformers or
        boosters, which will in fact constitute the "new grid". But this
        dynamic or "energy grid" is free, mobile, unbound to material or
        wires, and in its turn is supplied from a Central Station of
        powerful Stators. </p>
      <p>This is the ultimate application of the Primary technique as a
        whole; in the earlier stages, the present generating stations
        and grid could be utilized, substituting for turbo- or
        hydro-electric Prime Movers the new Stators and Rotors, the
        Prime Mover set of the New Technique. </p>
      <p>The distributing Central Spheres of "Centrals" or mobile grid
        boosters, Schappeller declares, will have an effective range of
        up to 10 kilometers. </p>
      <p>It will probably by now be obvious that since this is
        "biomagnetism" there will be technical and other applications of
        the Primary Force of a fundamental character, the nature of
        which cannot yet be either conceived or visualized. </p>
