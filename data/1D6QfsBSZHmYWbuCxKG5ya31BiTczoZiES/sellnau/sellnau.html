      <br>
      Trial run: Delphi researchers tested a new combustion strategy in
      this single-cylinder test engine.<br>
      <br>
      Delphi, a major parts supplier to automakers, is developing an
      engine technology that could improve the fuel economy of
      gas-powered cars by 50 percent, potentially rivaling the
      performance of hybrid vehicles while costing less. A test engine
      based on the technology is similar in some ways to a highly
      efficient diesel engine, but runs on gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      The company has demonstrated the technology in a single-piston
      test engine under a wide range of operating conditions. It is
      beginning tests on a multicylinder engine that will more closely
      approximate a production engine. Its fuel economy estimates
      suggest that engines based on the technology could be far more
      efficient than even diesel engines. Those estimates are based on
      simulations of how a midsized vehicle would perform with a
      multicylinder version of the new engine.<br>
      <br>
      The Delphi technology is the latest attempt by researchers to
      combine the best qualities of diesel and gasoline engines. Diesel
      engines are 40 to 45 percent efficient in using the energy in fuel
      to propel a vehicle, compared to roughly 30 percent efficiency for
      gasoline engines. But diesel engines are dirty and require
      expensive exhaust-treatment technology to meet emissions
      regulations.<br>
      <br>
      For decades, researchers have attempted to run diesel-like engines
      on gasoline to achieve high efficiency with low emissions. Such
      engines might be cheaper than hybrid technology, since they don’t
      require a large battery and electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      In conventional gasoline-powered engines, a spark ignites a
      mixture of fuel and air. Diesel engines don’t use a spark.
      Instead, they compress air until it’s so hot that fuel injected
      into the combustion chamber soon ignites. Several researchers have
      attempted to use compression ignition with gasoline, but it’s
      proved challenging to control such engines, especially under the
      wide range of loads put on them as a car idles, accelerates, and
      cruises at various speeds.<br>
      <br>
      Delphi’s approach, which is called gasoline-direct-injection
      compression ignition, aims to overcome the problem by combining a
      collection of engine-operating strategies that make use of
      advanced fuel injection and air intake and exhaust controls, many
      of which are available on advanced engines today.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the researchers found that if they injected the
      gasoline in three precisely timed bursts, they could avoid the
      too-rapid combustion that’s made some previous experimental
      engines too noisy. At the same time, they could burn the fuel
      faster than in conventional gasoline engines, which is necessary
      for getting the most out of the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      They used other strategies to help the engine perform well at
      extreme loads. For example, when the engine has just been started
      or is running at very low speeds, the temperatures in the
      combustion chamber can be too low to achieve combustion ignition.
      Under these conditions, the researchers directed exhaust gases
      into the combustion chamber to warm it up and facilitate
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Mark Sellnau, engineering manager of advanced powertrain
      technology at Delphi Powertrain, says the engine could be paired
      with a battery pack and electric motor, as in hybrid cars, to
      improve efficiency still more, although he notes that it’s not
      clear whether doing that would be worth the added cost.<br>

      </b>An engine control system, a controller for the engine control
      system, and a method of controlling a combustion process in an
      internal combustion engine operating at an engine operating
      condition. The engine control is based on closed-loop control of

      difference between an end of fuel injection (EOI), or some other
      aspect of an injection control signal, and a start of combustion
      (SOC), or some other aspect of an internal combustion event. One
      or more engine control devices, such as a fuel injector or an

      present in the combustion chamber at the moment combustion starts
      may be controlled.; Advanced combustion systems utilizing premixed
      compression ignition (PCI) offer the benefit of low temperature

      engine is commanded to operate the engine intake valves according
      to the selected one of the plurality of predetermined valve lift
      profiles to thereby optimize fuel economy and reduce emissions at

      <b> </b><br>
      A method is disclosed for detecting misfire or partial burn and
      for controlling spark retard in the cylinders of an internal
      combustion engine operated under the control of a microprocessor
      and utilizing signals indicative of the pressure in said cylinder
      at crank angle positions before and after initiation of
      combustion. A ratio of the actual pressure to the motored pressure
      in the cylinder at one or more predetermined crank angles is used
      to estimate the fraction of fuel burned which, in turn, enables a
      determination of combustion failure in said cylinder cycle.
      Confirmation of said misfire or unacceptable partial burn leads to
      correction of engine operation by said controller and/or to a
      diagnosis of possible damage to the vehicle's catalytic converter.
      This method also permits better engine operation under conditions
      of high spark retard.<br>

      </b>This invention is an annular sensor that measures combustion
      chamber pressure in an internal combustion engine. The sensor is
      located in an engine component opening, such as a spark plug well,
      and is engaged with first and second walls that define the ends of
      the opening. The first wall is located near the combustion chamber
      and flexes in response to varying combustion chamber pressure. The
      second wall is located away from the combustion chamber and
      remains relatively rigid. Movement of the first wall relative to
      the second wall due to varying combustion chamber pressure
      transmits a load to the sensor. The sensor generates an output
      signal that corresponds to that load which may subsequently be
      used to control engine functions.<br>

      is also provided at the second end of the capacitor, and a number
      of diodes are preferably included for providing for amplifier
      input protection, electrostatic discharge protection and output DC
      overvoltage protection. When the amplifying circuit of the present
