      like radiating and receiving conductors. Energy in the form of
      electromagnetic waves, or electrostatic charges in the ether, is
      absorbed by or radiated from a network of metallic conductors
      utilized in combination with an impinging stream of Roentgen rays.
      The aerial network consists of a rhomboid of fine wires a
      supported by a central conductor b, which is earthed at m. A motor
      or other receiving apparatus is connected between the points d, e.
      Roentgen rays from a discharge tube c are stated to form an
      ionized beam of air which increases the absorption of energy by
      the network a. A magnet m deflects any electron emission away from
      the path of the rays.<br>

        font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I, SERAFINO ORLANDO, O.D.C., - subject of the king of Great
      Britain, of Birchircara, Malta, do hereby declare the nature of
      this invention to be as a follows: We were accustomed to combine
      the idea of electricity with that of wire conductors, and
      everybody knew that for the transmission of electrical energy it
      was necessary to make an exclusive use of metallic wires. But at
      the present time it is no longer thought necessary to use these
      means for the transmission of electrical energy, so much so that
      both electrostatic and electro-magnetic inductions are actions
      which are transmitted through the air, and although their fields
      of action are very limited, nevertheless they are clear proof that
      electricity can be transmitted not only through wires, but also
      through the ether, which is to be found in the air, and, as a
      proof of this, we may adduce the phenomenon of wireless
      telegraphy.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that this phenomenon is due to electrical current most
      rapidly alternated produced by apparatuses in which oscillatory
      electrical discharges are produced.<br>
      <br>
      These oscillatory discharges, which are the reciprocating motions
      of electricity, are not onlv limited to the system of the
      apparatuses in which they are produced, but, as the electrical
      spark causing them explodes in the air, they are a phenomenon
      which occurs in the ether met with in the air, consequently,
      wherever the spark occurs, it produces in the ether periodical
      motions which get spread spherically all round in all directions
      so far as they are not obstructed by some obstacle, and,
      therefore, it is inferred that the electrical waves are nothing
      but an electromotive force transmitted from one point to another
      by means of the ether.<br>
      <br>
      Above all, it is clear that the action of these oscillations at a
      distance is bound to be greater, the greater the energy employed
      in this oscillatory motion happens to be.<br>
      <br>
      We know that the quantity of electrical energy which can be
      communicated to a conductor or to a system of conductors depends
      on its capacity. The smaller the conductor is, the less is its
      capacity, and, therefore, the smaller is the energy of the
      oscillations which are produced in it when, after having been
      charged, it is discharged through the medium of the spark.<br>
      <br>
      In fact the period ot these electrical oscillations increases
      proportionately to the square root of the capacity of the
      oscillatory system.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently the above consideration warns us to use a system of
      conductors of great capacity in order to obtain extremely long
      waves, for the latter set in motion a quantity of energy greatly
      superior to that induced by short waves.<br>
      <br>
      Now as these waves are propagated spherically all round in space
      in all directions, however much one tries to render the
      apparatuses powerful, it always remains true that the electrical
      energy transmitted in space is an electromotive force dispersed in
      all directions, in a sirmilar way to the luminous waves issuing
      from a lighted splinter, which spread through the ether in all
      directions, and in the same way as these, their intensity
      decreases as the distance inereases, and, however great the energy
      sent forth by the generating station of wireless telegraphy to the
      receiving station may be, only a very slight fraction of the
      transmitted energy reaches it; first on account of the loss of
      intensity due to the distance from the source, and, secondly,
      because the electrical energy employed in these apparatuses is due
      to a pure phenomenon of resonance.<br>
      \<br>
      The same thing happens here as when a tuning fork, tuned to A (1a)
      pitch, is sounded in the vicinity of a pianoforte note having the
      same A sound, when the latter in its turn is caused to vibrate and
      emit sound.<br>
      <br>
      Nobody, of course, refuses to recognize the great difference
      existing between the intensity of sound emitted by the tuning fork
      and that felt by vibration.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore in order to succeed in solving the problem of wireless
      traction, setting aside the apparatuses in which the phenomena of
      resonance are produced, it is necessary to have recourse to other
      contrivances, having the property opf intercepting, or of better
      absorbing, in great quantities, the electrical energy dispersed in
      space, causing it to flow in a desired direction or to flow
      towards a required point, which amounts to saying that it is
      necessary to construct an invisible conductor in space which may
      serve as a path to these waves, and to concetrate them at any
      point that may be required. The possibility of constructing such
      an apparatus results from the scientific proofs I am about to
      submit whilst unfolding my ideas.<br>
      <br>
      Roentgen rays, among other marvelous properties, possess one which
      is of greatr physical interest, that is, these rays discharge very
      rapidly the electrified bodies they meet with.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prove in a simple way this fact it will suffice to use
      a gold-leaf electroscope whose leaves are electrified with an
      ebonite rod, or with rubbed glass. As soon as the Roentgen rays
      are produced in its vicinity, the gold leaves, at first ready to
      diverge and retain this position, now instantaneously fall down,
      which is a sure proof that the air loses its insulation properties
      and becomes a conductor.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the air traversed by these rays becomes a conductor,
      says Prof. Graetz, is explained by admitting that owing to them,
      the molecules of air split up, giving origin to very small
      particles, some of which are charged positively, and others
      negatively. It is therefore asserted that the air is ionized by
      these rays; the free ions in the vicinity of a charged body can
      become united to this electricity, and, therefore, can discharge
      it, and consequen tly this ionized air possesses a certain
      conductivity in such a way that if from any cause there is a
      difference of potential existing between two points in the air, an
      electric current is bound to pass, same as happens in a saline
      solution. Another property of great importance was observed when
      it was rendered possible to conduct to the outer side of a
      Crookes' tube cathodal rays, the negative electrons, which in
      electrolytic phenomena are inseparable from matter, are freed from
      the latter and subsist free, from which reason, owing to the high
      tension obtained in Crookes' tubes, they depart from the cathode
      with a velocity of about 1/3 that of light, and they act as if
      they carried away with them negative electricity, and consequently
      every body met with by the cathodal rays becomes electrified
      negatively.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus proposed by me to intercept, or rather absorb in
      great quantities, the electric waves and to profit by it in its
      application to electrical power generation, will consist of an
      assemblage of fine copper wires, in several layers, one inside the
      other, laid out in the form of a flat rhombus, of which one
      diagonal is remarkably greater than the other. The wires of the
      several layers are relatively staggered. The two extremities of
      all these wires are paced in communication with the central main
      wire the latter to have such a section as to allow of a resistance
      which may correspond exactly to the one offered by all the wires,
      taken as a whole. Underneath in the center of this apparatus, is
      placed a Crookes' tube capable of producing rays in great
      quantities. The position of this tube is determined so as to allow
      of the copper wires being traversed by the rays throughout all
      their extension. The superficies of the apparatus will be
      proportioned to the extent to which the rays are projected, which
      extension will depend on the form and size of the platinum cone
      existing at the center of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      The above-mentioned tube if of the Thomson model, would be highly
      suited to the predetermined object; here the negative charge is
      transmitted to two diametrically opposed points, adn in the inner
      part, the cathodes are represented by two specular and concave
      aluminum conductors, whilst in the center of the tube is to be
      found the anode formed by the platinum cone receiving the positive
      charge.<br>
      <br>
      When the current is discharging towards the tube, the cathodal
      rays strike the platinum cone at their focus respectively on each
      side, and thus large quantitites of rays are projected in straight
      lines perpendicularly to the superficies of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomena to be verified in this apparatus are the following
      :--<br>
      <br>
      The rays emanating from the tube, when it is placed in the
      above-mentioned position, whilst they strike the surrounding air
      rendering it ionized and consequently conductive, must at the same
      time traverse the copper wires impregnating them with negative
      electricity. The extent of the layer of ionized air and the
      intensity of the negative charge will undoubtedly depend on the
      greater or lesser power of the apparatus in which the Roentgen and
      cathodal rays are generated.<br>
      <br>
      The electric waves sent continually by the generating station with
      the rapidity of light in all directions, must on their way through
      space meet with the obstacle, so to say, wherever it may be,
      formed by the conductivity of the ionized air through the action
      of the Roentgen rays projected by the tube, and attracted and
      absorbed by this conductivity of the air, they produce in the
      space struck by the rays a true aerial conductor, which gets
      charged without interruption with electricity, for as the air is a
      non-conductor, only the layer struck by the rays becomes charged
      with electricity, and the air which surrounds it must retain its
      insulating properties. With respect to electric waves absorbed by
      the ionized air, Prof. Wimbledon Hill says:<br>
      <br>
      "Electric waves suffer the least absorption when travelling
      through a non-conductive medium like ether. Marconi observed in
      1902 that signals that carried 1500 or more miles at night-time,
      would not carry for about 700 miles in the day. The action of
      daylight is responsible for the greater absorption; sulight
      produces partial ionization of the atmosphere, and renders it
      conductive".<br>
      <br>
      From what we have said before, it is inferred that the air ionized
      by the Rentgen rays should absorb electric waves in a greater
      quantity, as its conductivity is extraordinarily greater than when
      it is ionized through the action of solar rays. In fact it has
      been proved above that electrified bodies when discharged in the
      vicinity of the Roentgen rays, whilst this never happens through
      the action of solar rays, for if such a thing could occur, as the
      sun's rays strike all day long the atmosphere, the properties of
      the static electricity would not have been discovered, because we
      should never have been able to have a body charged with
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The rays projected by the tube in lines perpendicular to the
      superficies of the tube, present to our sight the form and size of
      the inviisble conductor produced by the ionization of the air
      which attracts and absorbs continually the electric energy; this
      electric energy, being bound to follwo the course formed in the
      air by the projection of the rays, must necessarily come into
      contact with the wires charged negatively through the action of
      the rays themselves, and here then takes place the meeting of the
      two conductors charged with two kinds of electricity, for it is
      laid down as a law that two different conductors have always
      different potentials, namely a positive and a negative potential.
      The difference of potential causes the negative electrons of the
      ionized air to be urged on towards the positive conductor, whilst
      the positive ions are attracted by the negative conductor. In
      contact with the two conductors they give up their charegs, thus
      originating the electric current.<br>
      <br>
      The magnitude of this current will depend on the greater or lesser
      ionization of the air. The greater the difference of potential
      between the two conductors, the quicker the electrons and ions
      will be displaced, this communicating for each unit of time
      greater charges to the two conductors.<br>
      <br>
      The magnitude of this current will depend on the greater or lesser
      ionisation of the air. The greater the difference of potential
      between the two conductors, the quicker the electrons and ions
      will be displaced, thus communicating for each unit of time
      greater charges to the two conductors.<br>
      <br>
      In the apparatus, the positive or highest potential corresponding
      to an excess of electricity ought to be found in the invisible
      conductor formed by the ionised air, because the poteintial of a
      conductor is inferred from the relation between the capacity of
      the conductor and the quantity of electricity it possesses, and
      therefore it follows as a consequence that the negative or lower
      potential corresponding to a deficiency of electricity ought to be
      found in the bundle of wires.<br>
      <br>
      A difference of potential between two charged conductors has as a
      consequence that when these two conductors are put into
      communication a flow of electricity is produced through the bodies
      joining together the two points of different potential, that is,
      an electric current is produced, or rather, an electromotive force
      from the higher potential to the lower; therefore, according to
      this other law, the electricity found in the conducting air, which
      is at the highest potential, should pass over the metallic
      conductors of the apparatus, which are at the lower potential.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been said that the current is produced through the
      wires uniting together the two points at different potentials. In
      this apparatus, owing to the nature of one of the conductors, such
      as the ionized air, because the air by itself, as can very easily
      be understood, supplies this defect, as the electricity which it
      possesses is in continuous contact with the other electricity
      produced continually in the wire; therefore, as electricity flows
      with greater ease through metallic conductors. than through any
      other conductor, then the recombining of the two electricities,
      one of the ionized air, and the other of the wire, cannot occur
      through the medium of the air, but runs over the bundle of the
      metallic wires, and generates in these an electric current; the
      greater the difference of potentials, the greater will be also the
      flow of electricity from one point to the other. So long as the
      difference of potentials is maintained always constant, a true
      electric current is produced in the conductors, as can be
      experimented with an electrostatic machine.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, through the rotation of the machine, to one fo the
      conductors is commiunicated positive electricity, and the other
      negative electricity, that is, a difference of potential is
      constantly maintained between them, whence the two electricities
      flow continuously in the wire, or in the wires, and an electric
      current is produced.<br>
      <br>
      In the apparatus the two electricities, namely that of the air and
      that of the wires, both produced without interruption through the
      action of the rays projected by the tube, finding themselves in
      continual contact with each other, the difference of potential is
      maintained constatn, and provokes, as already proved above, the
      passage of electricity through the wires, or else the electric
      current.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY</span><br>
      <br>
      In addition besides the electric waves, also atmospheric
      electricity, for the same reason ought to take part in the
      phenomenon, and be absorbed by the apapratus. In fact the
      atmosphere is in an electric state always and everywhere, so much
      so that the differences of potential even between localities not
      very far from one another is sometimes considerable. When it is
      fine weather, the air is usually electrified positively, and the
      earth naturally is negatively electrified by induction. The free
      electricity of the atmosphere is in greater quantity in high
      regions. It undergoes vaariations of a relative periodicity during
      daytime, and the seasons.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to what I state, what is asserted by an American
      science journal. Science adn Invnetion ( May 1921) is quite to the
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      "It is said that Dr Plauson, a german scientist, has sucessfully
      demonstrated that if we send up metal surfaced balloons and tap
      the electrical energy from the atmosphere at a level of 1000 feet
      or more, we shall be able to realize an average of 200 hp per
      square meter, an area equivalent to 3.28 square feet. It is even
      claimed that in his latest experiments, as great a quantity of
      electrical energy as 400 to 500 hp has been realized per square
      meter. Under normal conditions, the potential gradient, as it is
      called, of the atmosphere increases with comparative regularity as
      we rise above the surface of the ground, the&nbsp; atmospheric
      potential per foot or per meter varies also, as may be well
      imagined, with the season of the year, and the potential&nbsp; or
      voltage has been found to average 100 volts per meter (3.28 square
      feet) in the summer months, while during the cold winter seasons
      the potential gradient rises to as high as 300 volts per meter..."<br>
      <br>
      The same scientific journal (March 1922) makes the following
      remarks : --<br>
      <br>
      "The amount of electrical power that resides in our atmosphere is
      astounding. Herr Plauson found in hsi experiments that a single
      balloon sent aloft at a height of 300 yards gave a constant
      current of 400 volts of 1.8 amperes, or in 24 hours, 17-1/4
      kilowatts ! By using two balloons in connection with a special
      condenser battery, the power obtained was 81-1/2 kilowatts in 24
      hours ! The actual current delivered was 6.8 amperes at 500
      volts..."<br>
      <br>
      Now it is well known that x-rays are effective at a distance of
      almost 30 feet according to a statement by the French Academy of
      Arts and Sciences with the following words: --<br>
      <br>
      "X-rays produce electrons on their passage through the air; these
      electrons are definite entities, and as they leave atoms, they may
      traverse matter or pass through teh air in a stright path, and by
      their coming in collision with the atoms of the air, they render
      it a conductor of electricity. it is true that screens of lead
      suffice to protect the operators from the evil effects of x-rays,
      but operators are sometimes careless, and then the rays are
      effective at a distance of almost 30 feet."<br>
      <br>
      Supposing therefore the air ionized by the rays to be 5 square
      meters, such an area at an altitude of 1000 feet, according to the
      latest experiments by Dr Plauson, should effect a force equivalent
      to 5 x 200 = 100 up to 5 x 500 - 2500 hp. Therefore whenever the
      apparatus at an altitude of several meters from the ground is
      capable of absorbing from an area of 5 square meters as much
      electricity as is required to realize a force of 1% in comparison
      to that obtaiend at an altitude of 1000 feet from the earth, it

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      All physicists, among whom may be included Hertz and Faraday,
      admit that electric and luminous waves are identical, that is,
      oscillations of the ether of varying length. The luminous waves
      acting on sight, have a length varying from 4 to 7 ten thousandth
      of a millimetre, according to the various colours, whilst the
      longer wave of 40-50 ten thousands of millimetres show themselves
      only for technical properties in apparatuses suited to this
      object:<br>
      <br>
      Electric waves are much longer, for they measure from several
      centimetres, to thousands of metres, but the difference between
      these two kinds of waves is only in length.<br>
      <br>
      Taking this for granted, we may state that electric waves before a
      very short duration of oscillation appear to us as light; while
      electric waves of a great duration of oscillation do not manifest
      themselves to us as light, but owing to their effects of induction
      show themselves as electric waves. If all this be true, (and all
      consequences therefrom can be verified) it can surely be possible
      to obtain by means of electric waves the same phenomena as with
      luminous waves, and the laws ruling the latter can be applied to
      the former.<br>
      <br>
      And this Hertz proved by experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Now physics teach us that the intensity of light is inversely
      proportional to the square of the distance from the source, that
      is to say, it decreases with the square of the distance from the
      source, that is from the distances.... 1, 2, 3, the intensity of
      light is proportional to the numbers.... 1, l/, etc., and this
      occurs because light gets spread in all directions over spherical
      surfaces of a radius increasing with the distance. Spherical
      surfaces with rays .... 1, 2, 3 etc. have a magnitude proportional
      to the numbers.... 1, 4, 9 etc., that is, spherical surfaces
      increase with the square of the rays.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore as the intensity of the light has to be communicated to
      ether waves whose superficies increase at the square of the
      distance, each of them receives a part of the former (that is of
      light) whose magnitude decreases in the same measure.<br>
      <br>
      Since luminous and electric waves, according to the above adduced
      proofs, are identical, the enunciated law of the intensity of
      light may be applied (taking into consideration the multiform
      variations of the atmosphere) to the intensity of electric waves.<br>

      Improvements in and relating to Improved Means for Utilizing
      Electro-magnetic Radiation and Atmospheric Electricity for
      Transmitting and Generating Power.<br>
      <br>
      I, Serafino ORLANDO, of 47, Church Street, Kensington, W. 8,
      British subject, late of Birchircara, Malta, do hereby declare the
      nature of this invention and in what manner the same is to be
      performed, to be particularly described and ascertained in and by
      the following statement: -<br>
      <br>
      My invention relates to an improved means of absorbing
      electro-magnetic energy from the ether. The electro-magnetic
      energy may be of the form of electromagnetic waves radiated from
      some radio transmitting station or from the electrostatic charge
      in the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      According to my invention I provide an arrangement of metallic
      conductors, preferably in the forum of a network beneath which I
      introduce a source of X-rays and from this source I project the
      rays upwards through the conductors. It is known that a beam of
      X-rays causes the air penetrated by such rays to become ionised
      and consequently conducting for a distance dependent on the
      strength of the rays. I am aware that in conjunction with the
      X-rays emitted by the X-ray tube are certain other rays called
      cathodal rays which carry with them negatively charged electrons
      which cause all bodies they meet to become charged with negative
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      According to my invnetion I find that when electromagnetic waves
      strike th region of the ionized air enveloping the network of
      conductors, produced by the x-rays projected into the network, the
      arrangement is fouind to be equivalent to a conductor of great
      height, but when the source of ionization is removed practically
      no absorption of energy takes place in the conductors.<br>
      <br>
      The function of the ionisation being to increase the small
      superficial area of metal exposed for the purpose of absorbing
      electromagnetic energy by rendering the air surrounding the
      conductors conductive to the passage of electromagnetic energy
      from a source of X-rays or other rays capable of producing
      ionisaztion.<br>
      <br>
      In this invention it is found desirable to arrange the size of
      network to suit the strength of the source of ionisation or
      conversely to arrange the strength of the source of ionisation to
      suit the size of network; it being desirahble to fill the field of
      ionisation with conductors up to an intensity of ionisation which
      may be determined by experiment.<br>
      <br>
      It is also found desirable in the case of X-rays to prevent the
      rays from scattering by shaping the electrode and surrounding the
      tube by a metal vessel with an adjustable aperture.<br>
      <br>
      Should it be found desirable, the cathodal rays previously
      referred to may be prevented from striking the network of
      conductors by deflecting them by the aid of a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is illustrated by way of an example in the
      accompanying drawing in which: Fig. (1) shows the network of
      conductors in plan and elevation.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2 shows the electrical circuit.<br>
      <br>
      In carrying my invnetion into effect according to the apparatus
      illustrated, the nmetwork of conductors shown in Fig. 1 consists
      of a number of fine copper wires (a) communicating with a central
      conductor (b).<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 2 a source of x-rays (c) is shown beneath the arrangement
      of conductors (a) the details of which are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
      <br>
      These conductors 9a) may for convenience be connected to a
      terminal (d) to which the apparatus to be actuated may be
      connected through another terminal (c) to the earth.<br>
      <br>
      The magnet (m) may be introduced for the purpose of deflecting the
      cathodal rays (f) previously referred to.<br>
