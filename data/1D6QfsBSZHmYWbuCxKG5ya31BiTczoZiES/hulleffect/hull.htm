      HE FOUND THAT BY CHARGING THE OIL (OR REMOVING CHARGE FROM THE
      OIL, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE CARBON PARTICLES IN THE OIL) IN AN
      INTERNAL COMBUSTION MOTOR, THE BLOCK BECOMES MAGNETIZED&nbsp; AND
      THE SPARK MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT, SUCH THAT THE MOTOR CAN BE WEANED
      OFF OF FUEL. (THE ADDED SPARK SEEMS TO SUBSTITUTE FOR FUEL.) THE
      EFFECT SEEMS TO GO AWAY IF THE OIL STOPS MOVING, WHICH WOULD MAKE
      SENSE AS THE ENGINE BLOCK GALLERIES DRAIN BACK TO PAN, MAGNETIC
      SURFACE AREA IS LOST. <br>
      <br>
      TIMING MUST BE READJUSTED AS THE MOTOR SEEMS TO RUN OFF AN

      DISTRIBUTE THE KNOW-HOW VIA AUTO REPAIR FRANCHISES. <br>

      IT SEEMS THE CHARGE ASPECTS CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFECT WERE
      DESCRIBED BY VAN DEGRAFF IN HIS EARLY PATENTS COVERING THE ADDING

      <br>
      Hello all, I am a new member...I am Robert W
      Hull...inventor/co-inventor of The Hull Effect.<br>
      <br>
      In July of 2009 a member scouted out my forum. For all those
      people who are skeptics, the historical patent search performed
      has the US Patent office decalring this as a new field of study
      for the internal combustion engines. By improving the
      thermodynamic heat exchange by several times, greatly reducing the
      "drag" of all fluids, improving the viscocities of all fluids,
      decreasing the aero-dynamic drag by creating and maintaining a
      "static electrical field"... via the manipulations of the
      frequencies created by the alternator. For these reasons...only
      carbureted engines will allow for the many adjustments for
      re-tuning.<br>
      <br>
      Recent dyno testing proved over 200 foot punds of torque out of a
      134 cubic inch (2200 cc) at 1300 rpm's....using 6.67 to one
      compression ratio. The oddity...when the engine stalled with
      dynometer hooked up...it re-started without removing the torque
      load of the friction brake dynometer...using just the 12V standard
      starter....and one 12V battery.<br>
      <br>
      That is 130 foot pounds of torque at start-up...almost
      instantly...at 900 rpm ...a high idle. More than enough torque to
      cruise at 60 mph in a 4000 pound vehicle. additional 70 foot
      pounds of torque in the next 400 rpm's. Ergo the higher the
      rpm's...the more torque...so no need for hypermilling. Fuel
      consumption for moving a 12,500 pound machine...is less than 48
      ounces per hour...no matter what the terrain...or altitude.<br>
      <br>
      My point...for all the wonderful mpg.. posted on this
      forum...great achievements... The Hull Effect is the next phase of
      technology for the internal combustion engine. Many skeptics can
      be secure in the fact....this is not snake oil or a scam. The 2
      best patent attornies in the world have stated so.<br>
      <br>
      Why do I post??? The Hull Effect, being a new field of study has
      little to compare to...no existing authorities with PHD's. As it
      stands, only three of us know the adjustments to make. I can state
      that I have passed the 100 mpg marker in a full sized GMC pick-up
      truck....with many modifications....3 years ago....using a
      V-8...automatic transmission...lock out converter.<br>
      <br>
      Best to all,<br>

      Hello All<br>
      This is FrznWtr and I have been asked to start a thread on this
      topic on this Forum by one of the very Prominent members (who
      shall remain anonymous) Sooooo I'm Here to tell you about a group
      I've had success with. Below is a synopses of what I've done with
      a Honda Civic.<br>
      <br>
      My car without anything done to it was getting 30-32 mpg a HHO
      unit and EFIE took that to 40 mpg I took the HHO unit off for this
      test of the Hull Effect<br>
      <br>
      Go here if you would like to take a look after reading below
      thehulleffect : ran ice cold plasma<br>
      <br>
      I travel 50mi to work on the freeway - speed locked at 70. I have
      about 5mi on both ends that are some stop &amp; go but generally
      travel about 35 with sincronized lights - so I'd say 90% highway
      10% stop &amp; go. Tach average just under 3k<br>
      FrznWtr<br>
      <br>
      &gt; hi froze<br>
      &gt; how many miles have you done on the civic since the switch
      and when did the switch start to take affect?<br>
      <br>
      Immediate I think but very mellow or subtle. I didn't notice
      anything till I thought it wasn't running in the parking lot.
      Still consider the power thing odd - yaknow hard to say BUT Here's
      my actual data so far.<br>
      <br>
      Date Odometer= Milage Gallons MPG<br>
      4-30-09 - 227129 - 548 - 7.755 ----Full Tank<br>

      6-11-09 - 229974 - 392.1 - 5.252 - 74.65<br>
      6-13-09 - 230276 - 302.1 - 8.01 - 37.71<br>
      <br>
      These figures are from the actual receipts (Not just done in my
      head then reported by memory) Don't know what's up w/6-11-09 -
      Hadn't notices till siting down to do this.<br>
      <br>
      Latest fill figured at 43.5 mpg But I don't have the receipt in
      front of me. I don't beleave the Effect has fully occured and is
      still building. Time will tell. But for about $75 and 4 hr work -
      Big Smile<br>
      <br>
      This is on a Fuel Infected car. (Which does not work well - We
      need to figure out Why!) Need help :') Prob because of the
      magnetic pulse from the fuel injectors. {A carberated engine is
      found to do much better and has been replicated.}<br>
      <br>
      The one who found this effect says Car-berated engine Is best and
      dose Much Better. 200mpg+ ???? cool. I am working on one now.
      Should be done in couple weeks.<br>
      <br>
      I'm hoping for 1/4 the fuel usage w/twice the power.<br>
      <br>
      6-16-09<br>
      Earlier today I pulled out onto the highway in a tight spot and
      after looking at the rearview mirror, thought I'd speed up so I
      wouldn't hamper the truck behind me. 2nd gear and she wound up to
      about 4k and woosh 6-7k shift 3rd and man I'm doin 55mph shift to
      5th and brake slightly so as to not gain on the car in frount, try
      to act like Nothings Happening. HaHa. Cruse to town. Very
      interesting.<br>

      <br>
      &gt; I'm trying to find out if I can get something to convert my
      92 honda Fuel infected to a carb.&nbsp; By the way my civic has
      increased to 37 mpg and I subjectively feel the power is
      increasing?<br>
      &gt; FrznWtr<br>
      <br>
      June5-09 Re: Effort<br>
      OK two tanks of gas. 2nd read was 27MPG - Found leak in fitting
      when Engine running. Soon as shut off (As checked previous) would
      evaporate off rather quick. so fixed that. 3rd read<br>
      (w/say 1/4 run with leak) was 34MPG. I think their is a slight and
      I mean slight bit of power increase but this might be subjective.
      NO other Positive attributes noticed. BUT it dose smell like its
      running very rich. Sometimes when its running hot after long drive
      it is very hard to start. Like its flooded. Have to sit and wait
      5-10min. or it loads up agine and will run down the battery. I
      have no idea how I might reduce the fuel delivered. Will wait till
      I get the Holden done to mess with it any more. then want to try a
      vapor can and HHO to see if i can get it to run with the injectors
      shut off (Disconnected).<br>

      May26-09<br>
      I wonder if my 300 to 400 guess is as accurate as I want. might be
      to low maybe 5-600 but definitely lower. Need to get one of those
      Diagnostic Tachometers. Will start looking. I filled up on the way
      home this morning in the early hours. 345 miles 7.64 gallons =
      44.67 mpg I think. But need to check Total miles to make sure I
      Zeroed Odomiter last time I filled. Have to go through all the
      reciepts - 2<br>
      hour job. Got to sleep more first. Normal milage w/out HHO or EFIE
      is 30-32 mpg with HHO &amp; EFIE 40-43 mpg. This run is w/out HHO
      but EFIE for oxy sensor on. (EFIE fools Computer that full burn is
      occurring so it wont dump more fuel in to burn up the excess Oxy
      if their is any) I will add the HHO with Dry Cell soon - After
      confirming MPG. Just for info pourpose. I intend to fully convert
      this rig later. But this is with the fuel injection as is. OH had
      to take my fuel regulator out of fuel line to get it to run day
      befor yesterday. Teed it off and will add "Y" valve for later
      conversion to carb type input. Need to put injector switch in so I
      can shut it off.&nbsp; Important to be able to convert it back for
      inspections.<br>
      Till later FrznWtr<br>
      <br>
      May26-09 Re: Effort<br>
      HI KP<br>
      Still have the injectors working. This is said to hamper the
      effect reaching full efect. IT'S NOT A FULL CONVERSION. Just want
      to make that clear. I put a remote Oil filter kit on and put the
      signal in the returne hose. Thats it so far. The idle went down
      and I'm still cking milage but I think it is better. I had a EFIE
      on the Oxygen sensor already from HHO experiments. I also have a
      "T" in the fuel line I'm tempted to put the signal to but, want to
      CK MPG this way first.<br>

      <br>
      May24-09 Re: Effort<br>
      OK install on Civic done. Yippie Took it for 20mile run. Dident
      notice anything till I came out of post office. Normal Idle has
      always been around 1000rpm maybe 900. It was down to 600 and<br>
      just purring along. Brought it home and set Idle down to between
      300 and 400 cant tell as tack is original and not segmented at
      that point. 0100 tomorrow to work.<br>

      Just finished reading the document at the groups's files section.
      From what I learn the method to get the hull effect is: To use the
      wire from alternator that go to battery positive as light dimmer
      input and wire the combined light dimmer output to the streaming
      engine oil.<br>
      <br>
      My opinion of what happen is: The alternator create spike which
      being transfered to the oil, which create HV bubble inside it.
      When the egnine is running, charged oil will rotate at the same
      speed as the engine rotation. This rotation of charged fluid will
      create magnetic field maybe the same way as homopolar motor. The
      magnetic force will be created perpendicullar with the rotation.
      The magnetic force make the whole car body act like a huge magnet.
      This magnetic force influence people, fuel, oil or even
      surrounding environment.<br>
      <br>
      According to local academic here, fuel or hydro carbon that
      exposed to magnet will be more aligned and will combust more
      easily. If three small magnet extracted from computer speaker can
      noticably change the power on 100cc motor, a magnetic at the size
      of a car should allow much more change to the fuel or the oil. The
      fuel should burn more easily and may make the engine fuel ratio
      too rich when the magnetic field increased. The oil may also burn
      which translate to darker oil color and an increase of engine
      temperature. The magnetic effect on people should be felt more
      than any magnetic device sold. If water is placed on top of the
      engine the water should now have the healing properties like what
      anyone experience with a glass on top of small magnet.<br>

      If this effect caused by rotating HV magnetic force, I think we
      should try wrapping rubber fuel line of the car with coil powered
      by:<br>
      - HV from car coil to the distributor or spark plug<br>
      - radiant oscillator HV secondary.<br>
      <br>
      It would be dangerous if the increased engine heating of the hull
      effects is caused by burning oil. It would be best to isolate the
      effect. Thought I'd add another effort for you all to ponder. This
      is what someone else on the group has done<br>
      FrznWtr<br>
      <br>
      &gt; After experimenting for a few months I have finally managed
      to install a stainless steel probe to the high pressure oil sensor
      side of engine that yields improved MPG on this 85 Nissan 720
      pickup with 2.0 liter engine, electronic carburetor, conventional
      distributor. In place, was the Lutron switch mounted close to the
      coil, an on/off switch in the engine compartment, one 1/8" hole in<br>
      thermostat, grounds to head and alternator, disconnected
      distributer advance, no PCV valve with line into filter housing,
      probe is a stainless steel needle inside an insulated wire cover
      JB welded inside a brass fitting. Have photo of probe/fitting if
      anyone is interested.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Recent short trips (20-40 miles) letting the engine warm up
      for five minutes before filling up and re-filling at the same pump
      have yielded 39.8, 36.5, 46.2, 42.7 mpg. Probably need to take
      longer road trips for a more reliable MPG tests. Also, need to get
      a compass to check for changes in and around engine. Engine seems
      to run more smoothly, with more power, and starts easily. Have not
      noticed any reduced air noise slip stream effect yet.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Previously this truck has been getting somewhere between
      26-30 mpg before and during earlier testing.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Before the successful probe to the high pressure oil I tried
      various probes that I feel were not extended deeply into the
      engine and oil flow or not insulated well enough or used copper
      probe, and also experimented with dip stick probes with no
      improvement.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; With recent mileage improvements I am tempted to get a
      Edelbrock carburetor and try for the rest of the HE !<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Anyone else have any encouraging responses.<br>

      Originally my intention was to create a standard magnet driven
      tube device, and study its effects on auto engine materials such
      as oil.<br>
      <br>
      I used the 7X GL only to make the device feel right. I wanted the

      the oil cell effect on a running engine.<br>

      Adding this frequency over the top of everything would allow all
      parts of the system to communicate, as the cells of a body, as
      one.<br>
      <br>
      I call this a coherent vibrational field, and gives the machine
      the sense of life force or being alive.<br>
      <br>
      It also brings all the vibrations into a harmony, energy can move
      between them and become synchronous at the nuclear mass vibration
      level.<br>
      <br>
      I soon discovered the magnets were not needed.<br>
      <br>
      Also that the most interactive location for the bismuth slugs is
      not the center but the ends.<br>
      <br>
      While the opposing magnet strings do produce an expansive
      vibrational effect on a central bismuth core, this is a different
      effect then what happens on the ends of the tubes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tape Migration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Noticing unusual effects when the electrical tape I was using for
      spacing materials started to move on its own, in a rather
      geometric pattern. The tape was not randomly repelled, it was
      repelled with an order, and perfect pattern. The following is a
      record of the first few days. [The tape was wrapped to over
      thickness and then 1/2 layer cut off until the tubes slid together
      easily with little drag.]<br>
      <br>
      The tape stacks were wrapped perfectly straight.<br>
      <br>
      It would seem the length of the tubes and materials are the active
      element. The gap between the inner copper and middle iron layer is
      generating the strongest torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first time I have witnessed a torsion field actually
      moving something.<br>
      <br>
      I believe the stress on the tape, is a direct result of the 7X GL
      length, in vibration, between dissimilar metals, with a proper gap
      width.<br>
      <br>
      There appears to be an ability of torsion fields to move
      dielectric materials, or Carbon based materials like all plastics,
      and electric insulators.<br>
      <br>
      This creates a field that feels hot to the touch, like fire on the
      finger tips. Touching the tape while the device is assembled can
      produce a surprise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Oil cell experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Static effects on the bench.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A voltage on the Joe Cell filled with motor oil creates a large
      hot field at approx 155 vdc. Either polarity of voltage will
      generate a field, and the oil seems to be reactive, not holding a
      normal JC type charge as water does. The oil will not sustain a
      field over time and as soon as voltage is removed the fields
      slowly dies.<br>
      <br>
      The field has the basic geometry of a water field and manifests in
      very accurately spaced rings around the cell. Layers go from hot
      to neutral to hot on the compressed sections of the density rings.<br>
      <br>
      The field gets stronger over time if the voltage is on, and weaker
      over time when the voltage is removed. It build to a maximum
      pressure if left with voltage for several hours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cross Coupling</b><br>
      <br>
      To get the tube device to energize the oil, without using voltage,
      I cross couple them. Connect one end of the tube device inner tube
      to the outer tube of the Joe cell, connect the outer section of
      the tube device to the inner Joe Cell tube. This cross coupling
      causes each cell to raise the other vibrationally. This pattern is
      present in many devices we have studied, from Sweets inner coil
      arrangement, to the strange long electrical coils of old patents.<br>
      <br>
      Cross coupling inner and outer copper layers of two tube devices
      is a Torsion field effect and easily understood when one actually
      feels it.<br>
      In this case the field goes cold rather then hot as with electric
      field. <br>

      For reference purposes the fuel flow meter will read about 4.2
      when cruising at 50 MPH without any devices installed., and the
      sweet spot for economy feels to be around 50 MPH.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hull Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      In general it feels like the HE setup provides maximum boost at
      the minimum rate of fuel flow. For example, the car at idle will
      run approximately 25 Miles per hour.<br>
      <br>
      When cruising at highway speeds of around 50 MPH, the fuel flow is
      reduced to 3.8 but when starting up a hill, the flow needs to be
      increased significantly before a power increase actually kicks in
      – up to about 6 on the gauge.<br>
      <br>
      The sweet spot felt to be closer to 55 MPH. With the gauge
      indication 3.8.<br>
      <br>
      Very little difference could be felt between the Lutron Skylark
      device, and a standard lamp dimmer device.<br>
      <br>
      Both devices had performance peaks at a couple locations in their
      adjustment range, which could be felt in the engine performance,
      provided the engine was not in an accelerating mode. IOW, the
      lower the throttle setting, the more noticeable the peaks were.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Joe Cell</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Joe Cell connected with the cathode to the chassis, and the
      anode connected to plus through the cigarette lighter seemed to
      provide a similar increase in idle RPM, but gave a more consistent
      boost across the throttle range. There was a cleaner transition
      from cruising on level road to increasing power to climb a slight
      grade. Probably only about a change from 4 to 5 on the gauge to
      get increased power.<br>
      <br>
      The sweet spot for cruising speed was also about 55 MPH with a
      gauge reading of 3.8.<br>
      <br>
      The dimmer and JC were tested together by inserting the JC between
      the dimmer and the oil. In this mode the effects appeared to be
      somewhat additive. The smoother transition from minimum cruising
      fuel flow to increased power for a grade was maintained, as was
      the more consistent boost across different throttle settings. It
      was possible with careful adjustment of the dimmer setting to get
      the sweet spot up to 60 MPH.<br>
      <br>
      The gauge reading at 55MPH on level stretches dropped down closer

      Apparatuses and methods related to an internal combustion engine
      are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the apparatuses and
      methods include modifying a conventional internal combustion
      engine to enhance an operating efficiency. In other embodiments,
      an internal combustion engine of enhanced operating efficiency is
      disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] Embodiments of this invention relate generally to internal
      combustion engines and, more particularly, to mechanisms and
      methods for improving the overall performance and efficiency of
      such engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] An internal combustion engine (ICE) converts energy into
      work. Indeed, these engines are used to power many of the devices
      we benefit from every day, including, but not limited to,
      automobiles, airplanes, and electric generators. In other words,
      the internal combustion engine quite literally drives the world's
      economy.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] As used herein, the terms "engine" or "internal combustion
      engine" include, for example, without limitation, any device that
      converts energy, released by the combustion of a fuel, into
      mechanical energy in an output shaft or the like of the engine,
      regardless of size, application, or type of fuel. As also used
      herein, the terms "fuel" or "hydrocarbon fuel" include, for
      example, without limitation, any substance or material, organic or
      inorganic, which may be burned to release energy. Such substances
      or materials include, but are not limited to, crude oil, gasoline,
      diesel, kerosene, bio-diesel, heavy oil, or other fuel oil or any
      mixture thereof in any form. Although many of these fuels are
      considered to be nonrenewable natural resources, the principles of
      the present disclosure may be utilized with internal combustion
      engines running on fuels derived from renewable resources.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In today's society, it has become increasingly important to
      conserve energy and, in particular, hydrocarbon fuels. Societal
      and governmental pressure is causing many automobile and other
      manufacturers to rethink and redefine the definition of fuel
      economy. Even with improvements in fuel economy, however, many of
      the automobiles being manufactured and in use today continue to be
      powered by internal combustion engines. In addition, the average
      individual is driving more frequently and longer distances, which
      in itself tends to offset the gains achieved by improved fuel
      economies. Thus, because of the enormous amount of fuel converted
      into energy by internal combustion engines, even a small
      improvement in fuel efficiency can be a significant step towards
      energy conservation goals.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Improved fuel efficiency can also provide substantial
      environmental benefits. Since less fuel is being converted into
      energy, a proportionately smaller amount of harmful emissions is
      being produced. Again, because of the sheer number of internal
      combustion engines in use, this can create a significant overall
      improvement. Additional benefits may be obtained if the process of
      converting fuel into energy itself may be improved to produce
      cleaner exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Of course, the use of the internal combustion engine is not
      restricted to the automotive field. Diesel engines, for example,
      power many of the world's trains, and turbine engines power a
      majority of the world's commercial airplanes and electric power
      generating stations. In many cases, internal combustion engines
      are also used to power agricultural and construction equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, there exists a need for an apparatus and
      methodology for improving the overall performance and efficiency
      of internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0034] Reference will now be made in detail to the present
      exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are
      illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the
      same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to
      refer to the same or like parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] To facilitate an understanding of the principles of the
      present disclosure, the following discussion of a conventional
      automobile internal combustion engine and a selection of its
      various components is provided. Although automobile engines are
      discussed in detail below, the various embodiments disclosed
      herein are not limited to these exemplary uses. As a non-limiting
      example, the principles of the present disclosure may be also
      utilized in, among other things, the engine of a watercraft, a jet
      engine of an aircraft, an engine of a lawn mower or other
      agricultural equipment, and in fuel-powered generators, just to
      name a few.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Referring to FIG. 1, there is depicted an automobile
      internal combustion engine 100. Although it is recognized that
      automobile engines, and internal combustion engines in general,
      may vary greatly in design, engine 100 depicted in FIG. 1 is
      utilized for discussion purposes only. Engine 100 includes, among
      other things, an engine block 102, which houses a number of
      cylinders (not shown) and corresponding pistons (not shown).
      Although many of today's engines include four, six, or eight
      cylinders (and pistons), the principles of the present disclosure
      may be utilized with engines having any number of cylinders and
      corresponding pistons.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] With continued reference to FIG. 1, engine 100 further
      includes an oil pan 104 extending from engine block 102. Oil pan
      104 typically includes a removable chamber or bowl that is secured
      to a lower portion of engine block 102. As one having ordinary
      skill in the art will recognize, oil pan 104 functions to collect
      and store the oil used to lubricate the moving parts of engine
      100. In addition to lubricating the moving parts of engine 100,
      the oil within engine block 102 facilitates the removal of heat
      from within engine block 102. Engine 100 may also include an oil
      filter (not shown), which generally functions to remove
      particulates and debris from the circulating oil, and an oil
      pressure sensor 106, which functions to measure the pressure of
      the circulating oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Engine 100 may also include a thermostat 108, a fan 110, a
      water pump 112, and a radiator 114. Together, these components
      function as a cooling system 103 for engine 100 so as to regulate
      the temperature of engine 100. Specifically, water pump 112
      functions to circulate a cooling fluid between engine block 102
      and radiator 114. The cooling fluid may include water, a mixture
      of water and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), which is also known as
      antifreeze, or any other suitable cooling fluid known in the art.
      Radiator 114 functions as a heat exchanger and transfers heat from
      the cooling fluid flowing from engine block 102 to the air blowing
      through radiator 114 by fan 110. Thermostat 108 functions to
      regulate the rate of cooling fluid flowing from engine block 102
      to radiator 114. The cooling fluid is circulated between engine
      block 102 and radiator 114 by an upper hose 116 and a lower hose
      118.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Engine 100 further includes an alternator 120. Alternator
      120 may include any conventional alternator, such as, for example,
      three-phase alternators. As those having ordinary skill in the art
      will recognize, alternator 120 converts mechanical energy produced
      by engine 100 into electrical energy, which may be used to power
      an automobile's various electrical components, such as, for
      example, the headlights or radio, and/or recharge a portable power
      source, such as, for example, a battery. Like many power
      generation devices, alternator 120 includes both positive and
      negative poles. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the positive pole is
      indicated by a "+" symbol and the negative pole is indicated by a
      "-" symbol.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Engine 100 also includes a carburetor 122. As readily
      recognized in the art, carburetor 122 includes a device that
      combines air and fuel to produce an air/fuel combustion mixture
      for engine 100. Although the principles of the present disclosure
      will be largely discussed in connection with engines utilizing
      carburetors, those of ordinary skill of art will readily recognize
      that the embodiments described herein may be utilized with any
      internal combustion engine, regardless of the fuel delivery
      mechanism utilized. Indeed, the principles of the present
      disclosure may be utilized with automobile engines utilizing fuel
      injection technology, as will be discussed in greater detail below
      and in connection with FIG. 3. Carburetor 122 may be secured to
      engine block 102 by a plurality of suitable fasteners 190, 192
      known in the art. Fasteners 190, 192 may include, but are not
      limited to, bolts and/or screws. Although the illustrated
      embodiments depict the use of two fasteners 190, 192 to secure
      carburetor 122 to engine block 102, those of ordinary skill in the
      art will readily recognize that a greater or lesser number of
      fasteners may be used. Carburetor 122 may include a throttle plate
      138, which serves to regulate the flow of air into carburetor 122.
      In a conventional automobile internal combustion engine, the air
      flowing into a carburetor, such as, for example, carburetor 122,
      is approximately 600 cubic feet per minute (cfm). The air flowing
      into carburetor 122 mixes with fuel supplied to carburetor 122 to
      create an air/fuel combustion mixture, which is then supplied to
      engine block 102 for combustion purposes. The air/fuel combustion
      mixture is ignited with a cylinder by a spark provided by a spark
      plug (not shown). Carburetor 122 may also include a lower plate
      140, which serves to regulate the flow of the air/fuel mixture
      into engine block 102. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary
      skill in the art, both throttle plate 138 and lower plate 140 may
      be selectively adjusted to increase the flow of air and air/fuel
      combustion mixture, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] With continuing reference to FIG. 1, carburetor 122
      receives fuel 124 from fuel tank 126 via fuel line 128. Fuel line
      128 may be any suitable fuel line known in the art. Generally,
      fuel tank 126 may be spaced from engine block 102 and a mechanism
      for transporting fuel 124 from fuel tank 126 to carburetor 122 may
      be required. In these instances, fuel pump 130 transports fuel 124
      from fuel tank 126 to carburetor 122 by increasing the pressure of
      fuel 124, as readily known in the art. As already alluded to
      above, fuel 124 may include, for example, any substance or
      material, organic or inorganic, renewable or non-renewable, which
      may be burned in a combustion process to release energy. In some
      embodiments, fuel tank 126 may include a tank cap 134. Tank cap
      134 may be removably secured to fuel tank 126 and may be removed
      to replenish the fuel 124 within fuel tank 126 as necessary. Tank
      cap 134 may include a plurality of openings or vents 136. Vents
      136 may be configured to permit fuel vapors and/or atmospheric air
      to traverse tank cap 134.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Once fuel 124 reaches carburetor 122, it is mixed with a
      predetermined amount of air and delivered to engine block 102 to
      form an air/fuel combustion mixture. This combustion mixture is
      then supplied to engine block 102, which typically maintains a
      vacuum of approximately 18 Hg, for combustion purposes. Once the
      combustion process is complete, combustion exhaust gases are
      evacuated from within engine block 102 by an exhaust 132.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In a conventional automobile internal combustion engine,
      such as, for example, engine 100, the temperature of the exhaust
      gases leaving engine block 102 is typically in the range of
      400[deg.] F.-1400[deg.] F. These exhaust gases can be highly toxic
      and typically contain carbon monoxide, unburned fuel, unburned
      carbon, soot, and oil vapor. These toxic compounds are commonly a
      result of incomplete combustion, which may be caused by a fuel
      quality being incompatible with the required combustion process,
      incomplete mixing of the fuel and air, or insufficient heat to
      provide fuel decomposition, etc. Most fuels contain a wide variety
      of dissimilar hydrocarbon compounds with corresponding variable
      rates of vaporization, decomposition, and combustion reaction
      intensities. Some fuels vaporize quickly, decomposing easily and
      burning smoothly, while others vaporize very slowly, decomposing
      incompletely to form unstable compounds that burn very fast and
      even detonate. Still others simply polymerize into clusters,
      absorb heat energy, and simply escape out the exhaust as
      pollution.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Ideally then, for an internal combustion engine, or
      combustion equipment, to function at its optimum potential with
      minimum toxic emissions and the greatest possible efficiency with
      lower maintenance, vibration, and operating temperatures, the fuel
      must be able to vaporize and decompose easily and to propagate
      combustion reactions with controlled, stable velocities with an
      absolute minimum of shock waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Fuels, such as aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel,
      propane, and natural gas are all made up of the same building
      blocks, hydrogen and carbon. The difference between natural gas
      and diesel, for example, is simply how many carbon and hydrogen
      atoms are attached to each other in each molecule of fuel. The
      molecules of natural gas, for example, are very small and light
      since they contain only one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. This
      means that each molecular cluster of natural gas contains only one
      atom of carbon and only four atoms of hydrogen. It is so light
      that it is a gas at room temperature. When it burns, it
      essentially decomposes into carbon and hydrogen, which in turn
      bond to oxygen separately to form carbon dioxide gas, CO2, and
      water vapor, H2O. Every molecule of fuel produces one carbon
      dioxide molecule and two water molecules during combustion, which
      are the ultimate exhaust products of clean-burning natural gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In contrast, diesel fuel has many more atoms of carbon and
      hydrogen stuck together, for example, C15H32. This means, in this
      example, that every molecule contains fifteen carbon atoms and
      thirty-two hydrogen atoms bonded into one molecular cluster. These
      molecules are so heavy that they form dense liquids at room
      temperatures. In order to burn (i.e., chemically combine with
      oxygen to produce heat), each of the fifteen carbon atoms and
      thirty-two hydrogen atoms must break apart from each other so that
      the carbon atoms can combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide,
      CO2, and the hydrogen atoms can combine with oxygen to form water
      vapor, H2O. This is exactly the same process as burning natural
      gas, CH4, but because there are so many more atoms clustered into
      each molecule, it is a lot more difficult to break all of the
      atoms apart from each other. When the atoms do not break apart
      cleanly and easily, they do not all form CO2 and H2O. Instead, a
      lot of carbon atoms form their own clusters, without oxygen, to
      form soot, which is usually seen as black smoke coming from the
      exhaust system on many large diesel engines. In addition, many
      molecules of partially decomposed fuel leave the exhaust
      completely unburned, accounting for the acrid smell typically
      associated with diesel engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Natural gas burns clean because it is composed of lighter
      molecules having only one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms
      stuck together, and diesel fuel burns poorly because it is
      composed of heavier molecules of, for example, fifteen carbon
      atoms and thirty-two hydrogen atoms stuck together. The burning
      process itself does not change, disregarding the speed and
      reaction time of combustion in this example-only the complexity of
      molecular disintegration into atoms makes it more difficult to
      completely burn all of the atoms. In order to burn all of the
      atoms in any given fuel, therefore, the heavier molecules of
      typical fuels, such as, for example, gasoline, diesel, and
      kerosene, must be shattered.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Clean-burning, high-performance liquid fuels, such as
      high-octane aviation fuel, are made of the same components as
      diesel fuel and natural gas. However, the molecular structures of
      these fuels are refined in such a way as to have weak molecular
      bonds, which allows the fuels to decompose easily and quickly. The
      refining process can be very simple or increasingly complex,
      depending on the desired molecular bonding structure. To refine
      fuel, it helps to understand that crude oil contains every type of
      hydrocarbon cluster imaginable, from very light liquids to heavy
      oils and even tar all mixed together. Refiners ideally want to
      separate each group out so that the light liquids can be used for
      aviation (high-octane properties) and the middle groups, which are
      heavier, can be used as diesel fuel, etc. Distillation practices
      help separate some of these fuels into their similar molecular
      weight categories, but it is relatively slow and not an exact
      science. The distillation process basically relies on the
      principle that when heated at low temperatures, the lighter weight
      molecules, because they are bonded with only a few carbon and
      hydrogen atoms, become gases and subsequently rise to the top of
      the distillation tower and are extracted. When the temperature is
      raised slightly higher, the next heavier group of hydrocarbon
      clusters rise to the top for extraction and so on. As the
      hydrocarbon clusters become bigger, however, they do not easily
      separate or break apart from each other. The bigger the molecule,
      the stronger the forces of attraction hold them together.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Refiners soon learned that if they ran hydrocarbon fluids
      through metal catalysts, the electro-chemical reactions between
      the hydrocarbon clusters and the metal catalysts caused the
      hydrocarbon molecules to break apart into smaller clusters. This
      is because the electron orbits that are shared between the
      clusters of atoms are drawn, or rather, detached from each other,
      effectively breaking the links holding them together. These links
      break apart randomly, forming smaller and lighter molecular
      clusters, each of which may contain any random number of atoms.
      Such processes are generally referred to as hydrocarbon "cracking"
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The combustion of hydrocarbon-based fuels does not have to
      produce toxic pollution. The chemical reactions involved in the
      combustion process produces heat energy. Although this heat energy
      is the desired product of combusting fuel, it is difficult to
      manipulate and convert into controlled energy. The burning or
      combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in an internal combustion engine
      produces a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, of which
      only a portion can be converted into useable heat, or rather,
      pressure. The rest is usually wasted because the gaseous molecules
      in the combustion chamber are unable to absorb some of the intense
      radiation produced during combustion reactions. Some of the energy
      that is absorbed effectively accelerates the vibration levels of
      the gaseous molecules, allowing them to apply greater pressure on
      their surroundings. In an internal combustion engine, this
      pressure is converted into mechanical movement or power. Only
      about one third of the heat energy produced during combustion,
      however, is converted into useable pressure. The remainder of this
      energy is not entirely lost, but unfortunately can be responsible
      for the production of nitrous oxide (NO-x) emissions, excessive
      vibration, excessive heat in other parts of the combustion
      apparatus, and even excessive noise. As well, spontaneous,
      incomplete combustion reactions produce other types of unwanted,
      toxic emissions, such as carbon monoxide and soot.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] NO-x emissions can also be a result of a fuel's poor
      combustion characteristics, assuming properly functioning
      equipment and correct air/fuel ratios for complete combustion.
      When the fuel does not vaporize and decompose easily, the reaction
      time, once combustion is initiated, is delayed with a
      corresponding increase in combustion intensity. The combustion
      zone may accelerate from a relatively slow speed to an extremely
      high speed almost instantaneously. This extreme imbalance in
      velocity may produce significantly higher energy levels and
      actinic radiation with shorter photon emissions. Photolysis is a
      term used to describe chemical decomposition by electromagnetic
      radiation. It can occur when combustion reactions accelerate to a
      range where the photon emissions released contribute to further
      chemical reactions rather than normal thermal decomposition
      reactions of regular, controlled combustion. The actinic radiation
      produced during non-uniform, intense combustion reactions tends to
      decompose not only the fuel's molecular clusters but also the
      otherwise inert nitrogen molecules, ultimately contributing to
      undesirable chemical reactions and the production of unwanted
      toxic NO-x emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] As alluded to already, combustion is a chemical process
      involving the transfer of electrons between atoms known as
      oxidation reduction. In this process, liquid fuels must be
      vaporized and dissociated into atoms or free radicals before they
      can combine with oxygen to form new substances. Under ideal
      conditions, a great deal of energy is released and carbon dioxide
      and water are formed. Combustion is a process that is not
      completely understood. It seems, however, that free radicals may
      be the key elements to promote and propagate controlled chemical
      reactions. Radicals are the reactive intermediates responsible for
      dissociating the large clusters making up the fuel's molecular
      compounds into individual atoms when they only then can be
      oxidized to produce heat. This is a chain branch disintegration
      process that progresses throughout the combustion chamber until
      the fuel is consumed. Under ideal conditions, the reaction rate
      and chemical reactivity of high-quality fuels is rapid and the
      combustion zone proceeds progressively but smoothly throughout the
      combustion chamber. The intensity of the reaction zone, which
      ultimately determines the intensity of electromagnetic energy
      released, has a significant effect on the vibrational energies
      imparted on the molecules in the combustion chamber, which
      significantly affects their heat release potential. The
      vibrational energies obtained by the gaseous molecules in the
      combustion chamber, under ideal combustion reactions, are
      transformed into organized molecular motion that in turn produces
      maximum momentum, or rather maximum potential mechanical energy.
      Organized molecular motion of a working fluid, namely, the
      nitrogen and products of combustion in the combustion chamber,
      enables the electromagnetic energy produced during combustion to
      be transformed into controlled pressure with minimum entropy.
      Entropy, or wasted heat energy, is largely a result of random,
      chaotic vibration energies released during uncontrolled,
      excessively rapid combustion reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Ideally, therefore, for an engine to function at its
      maximum potential with minimum toxic emissions and greatest
      efficiency with lower maintenance, vibration, and operating
      temperatures (minimum entropy), the fuel must be able to decompose
      easily and to propagate combustion reactions with controlled,
      stable velocities with an absolute minimum of shock waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Turning now to FIG. 2, the principles of the present
      disclosure will be described in detail. In FIG. 2, there is
      depicted an internal combustion engine 200 in accordance with the
      present disclosure. Like engine 100, engine 200 may include an
      engine block 202, which may house a number of cylinders (not
      shown) and corresponding pistons (not shown), and an oil pan 204.
      Engine 200 may further include many of the components discussed
      relative to engine 100, including oil pressure sensor 206,
      thermostat 208, fan 210, water pump 212, radiator 214, and
      alternator 220. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that one
      or more of the aforementioned components may be excluded or
      duplicated as necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In accordance with the present disclosure, engine 200 may
      be provided with a mechanism 300 for delivering energy to engine
      200. The energy delivered to engine 200 may include, but is not
      limited to, mechanical energy, acoustic energy, electrical energy,
      radiant energy, thermal energy, chemical energy, or any
      combination thereof. Mechanism 300 may include any suitable
      mechanism known in the art. As a non-limiting example, in some
      embodiments, mechanism 300 may include a conductive element,
      including, but not limited to, a conductive wire or rod. For the
      purposes of this disclosure, it is contemplated that the
      conductive element of mechanism 300 may be conductive to one or
      more of the energies delivered to engine 200. As alluded to above,
      such energy may include, but is not limited to, mechanical energy,
      acoustic energy, electrical energy, radiant energy, thermal
      energy, chemical energy, or any combination thereof. Further, it
      is contemplated that mechanism 300, according to some embodiments,
      may be constructed of a suitable material, which does not diminish
      or retard in any way the quantity, quality, or intensity of energy
      being conducted through mechanism 300. In some other embodiments,
      mechanism 300 may be provided with an apparatus for amplifying the
      energy delivered through mechanism 300. In still other
      embodiments, mechanism 300 may include one or more components for
      regulating the flow of energy through mechanism 300, as will be
      discussed below in greater detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Mechanism 300 may be configured to deliver energy to engine
      200, or any portion thereof, from any suitable source. As a
      non-limiting example, in some embodiments, energy may be delivered
      to engine 200 from an electrical source, including, but not
      limited to, a battery (not shown) or an electrical energy
      generator, such as, for example, without limitation, alternator
      220. As alluded to above, alternator 220 may include, but is not
      limited to, a three-phase alternator. In other embodiments, energy
      may be delivered to engine 200 from any electrical field of
      suitable frequencies. Such electrical fields may be generated by,
      including, but not limited to, conventional generators, Muller
      dynamometers, magnetos, and/or static electricity. Further, those
      of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that energy
      may be delivered to a portion or all of engine 200 from a source
      disposed proximate to engine 200, spaced apart from engine 200, or
      from another part of engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In the illustrated non-limiting example, mechanism 300 may
      include a conductive wire 302 for delivering energy from
      alternator 220 to the oil circulating within engine block 202.
      Although those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that
      alternator 220 may be supplying electrical energy to wire 302, the
      principles of the present disclosure account for wire 302
      transmitting any of the aforementioned types of energy from
      alternator 220. As alluded to above, wire 302 may be conductive to
      one or more of mechanical energy, acoustic energy, electrical
      energy, radiant energy, thermal energy, chemical energy, or any
      combination thereof. Wire 302 may include any suitable conductive
      wire known in the art. As a non-limiting example, in some
      embodiments, wire 302 may include a conductive core surrounded by
      an insulating sheath. The conductive core may be metallic. In
      other embodiments, wire 302 may include, but is not limited to, a
      cable such as a fiber optic cable and/or coaxial cable.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Wire 302 may include any desired cross-sectional shape
      and/or configuration. As a non-limiting example, wire 302 may have
      a substantially circular cross-sectional shape. Wire 302 may also
      have one or more cross-sectional shapes and/or configurations
      along its length, and any desired dimensions suitable for
      transmitting energy to engine 200. As will be readily apparent to
      those of ordinary skill in the art, the overall dimensions of wire
      302 may be dependent upon application, engine size, and the type
      and quantity of energy being transmitted through wire 302.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Wire 302 may include a first end 302a and a second end
      302b. Although the depicted embodiment illustrates that first end
      302a may be connected to alternator 220, those having ordinary
      skill in art will readily recognize that first end 302a may be
      connected to any suitable energy source. Further, it is
      contemplated that first end 302a may be connected to a positive
      output terminal or port of alternator 220. First end 302b, in some
      embodiments, may be connected to a component 304 for regulating or
      controlling the flow of energy from alternator 220 to engine block
      202. In particular, it is contemplated that second end 302b may be
      connected to an input terminal of component 304. In other
      embodiments, however, second end 302b may be directly connected to
      the oil or other fluids within engine block 202 via a probe 308,
      which will be discussed below in greater detail. Regardless of how
      second end 302b may be connected to engine block 202, second end
      302b may be electrically isolated from engine block 202. Second
      end 302b may be electrically isolated from engine block 202 by any
      suitable means. As a non-limiting example, second end 302b may be
      insulated from engine block 202 by disposing an insulating
      material between second end 302b and engine block 202. Such
      insulating materials may include, but are not limited to, rubber
      or any other suitable material.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Component 304 may include any suitable apparatus for
      regulating, modulating, and/or controlling the flow of energy from
      alternator 220 to engine block 220. Component 304 may regulate
      and/or control the flow of energy by any suitable means known in
      the art. Of course, the specific means chosen to regulate and/or
      control the flow of energy may depend on, among other things, the
      characteristics and type of the energy being transmitted. Further,
      the inclusion of component 304 within mechanism 300 may depend on,
      for example, without limitation, the type, quantity, and
      characteristics of energy being transmitted through mechanism 300,
      and the energy source for a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In some embodiments, component 304 may regulate the flow of
      energy through mechanism 300 by introducing a resistance,
      filtering, amplifying, or otherwise altering the energy flowing
      from alternator 220 so as to, for example, adjust or control the
      amount of energy flowing through component 304. The resistance
      introduced by component 304 may include a single fixed resistance
      and/or a variable resistance. In instances where the resistance
      introduced by component 304 is variable, a suitable mechanism for
      selectively controlling the magnitude of resistance introduced by
      component 304 may be provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In other embodiments, component 304 may serve to amplify
      the energy being transmitted through mechanism 300. Component 304
      may serve to amplify the energy being transmitted through
      mechanism 300 by any suitable means known in the art. As a
      non-limiting example, component 304 may include an amplifier (not
      shown) that amplifies the energy input from alternator 220. Again,
      the specific amplifier required to amplify the energy flowing from
      alternator 220 may depend on, among other things, the
      characteristics of the energy transmitted and the particular
      application, such as, for example, engine type.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Component 304 may include, but is not limited to, any
      suitable electrical dimmer switch, which, for example, without
      limitation, may be configured to introduce a resistance to a flow
      of current. As a non-limiting example, the Model No. GLS03-B16681
      dimmer switch commercially available from Lutron Electronics, Inc.
      may be used to adjust or control the amount of energy flowing from
      alternator 220 to engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As another non-limiting example, component 304 may comprise
      one or more electrical circuits or components electrically linked
      together. Such electrical components may include, but are not
      limited to, diodes, resistors, and/or transistors. These
      electrical components may be electrically connected to one another
      in any suitable manner. As a non-limiting example, such electrical
      components may be connected together either in parallel or in
      series. In particular, in some embodiments, component 304 may
      include a plurality of diodes connected together in series. In
      other embodiments, component 304 may include a central processing
      unit and any suitable software or computer-controlled program for
      controlling the aforementioned electrical components.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In embodiments where second end 302b of wire 302 is not
      directly connected to engine block 202, mechanism 300 may further
      include a second conductive wire 306. Wire 306 may be configured
      to transmit energy from component 304 to engine block 202. To
      avoid duplication, wire 306 may be substantially similar to wire
      302, and may include many of the features and characteristics of
      wire 302 described above. As a non-limiting example, wire 306 may
      include a metallic core surrounded by an insulating sheath. Wire
      306 may further include a first end 306a and a second end 306b.
      The first end 306a may be connected to an output terminal or port
      of component 304, and the second end 306b may be connected to the
      oil or other fluids (e.g., engine coolant, hydraulic fluids, and
      transmission fluids) within engine block 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Second end 306b of wire 306 may be connected to engine
      block 202 at any suitable, desired location. As a non-limiting
      example, second end 306b may be operably secured to a dipstick
      (not shown) received in engine block 202. In other embodiments,
      second end 306b may be connected to an exterior housing of engine
      block 202. In still other embodiments, second end 306b may be
      connected to a probe 308, as shown in FIG. 6, which depicts an
      exploded illustration of oil pressure sensor 206 and its
      connection to engine block 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Referring now to FIG. 6, probe 308 may include any suitable
      apparatus for transmitting energy from wire 306 to the oil or
      other fluids within engine block 202 with minimal losses or
      resistances. In some embodiments, probe 308 may include a
      generally elongate member configured to be suitably isolated from
      engine block 202. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will
      readily recognize that the physical characteristics and properties
      of probe 308 may be dependent upon, among other things, the type
      and quantity of energy being transmitted to the oil or other
      fluids within engine block 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In the illustrated non-limiting example, probe 308 may
      include a rigid metal rod. Probe 308 may be made from any suitable
      material configured to transmit energy at rapid rates. As a
      non-limiting example, probe 308 may be made of a metal, such as,
      for example, without limitation, iron, stainless steel, nickel,
      silver, gold, or any other suitable conductive material. In
      another non-limiting example, probe 308 may also be made of
      silicone or any other suitable composite material. Further, probe
      308 may include any desired cross-sectional shape and/or
      configuration. As a non-limiting example, probe 308 may have a
      substantially circular cross-section. In addition, probe 308 may
      have one or more cross-sectional shapes and/or configurations
      along its length, and may have any desired dimensions. As a
      non-limiting example, probe 308 may include a portion 308b having
      an enlarged cross-sectional area.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Second end 306b of wire 306 may be secured to probe 308 in
      any suitable manner known in the art for transmitting energy from
      wire 306 to probe 308 with minimal losses. As a non-limiting
      example, the metallic core (not shown) of wire 306 may be
      soldered, welded, bonded, adhered, and/or mechanically fastened to
      probe 308.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Although the illustrated embodiment contemplates that wire
      306 and probe 308 may be manufactured as separate components,
      those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that
      wire 306 and probe 308 may be of a one-piece construction, so long
      as probe 308 may be electrically isolated from engine block 202.
      As a non-limiting example, probe 308 may be integrally formed with
      second end 306b of wire 306.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] As alluded to above, FIG. 6 illustrates the connection
      between oil pressure sensor 206 and engine block 202. In
      particular, oil pressure sensor 206 may be fluidly connected to
      engine block 202 by a hose 310, which extends between a port 312
      in engine block 202 and oil pressure sensor 206. Hose 310 allows
      oil to flow from within engine block 202 to oil pressure sensor
      206 and back.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some embodiments, probe 308 may be connected to engine
      block 202 via hose 310 and/or any other source so that probe 308
      is in fluid communication with the oil or other fluids circulating
      within engine block 202. Probe 308 may be in either direct or
      indirect contact with the oil or other fluids circulating within
      engine block 202. As a non-limiting example, a portion of hose 310
      may be cut to allow the introduction of probe 308 into the fluid
      (i.e., oil) pathway within hose 310. In one embodiment, hose 310
      may be cut to permit the introduction of a fitting 314. Fitting
      314 may include any suitable fitting, including, but not limited
      to, a T-shaped connector. As readily known to those of ordinary
      skill in the art, a T-shaped connector is an apparatus that
      includes three openings and may be used to connect a first fluid
      pathway to a second fluid pathway at a right angle to the first
      fluid pathway. Fitting 314 may be secured to hose 310 in any
      suitable manner known in the art. Once fitting 314 is secured to
      hose 310, probe 308 may be inserted into one of the openings of
      fitting 314 so that probe 308 is in contact with the oil flowing
      within hose 310. Although probe 308 may be connected to hose 310
      by any suitable means, it is contemplated that the use of fitting
      314 may facilitate selective insertion and removal of probe 308.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Those of ordinary skill in the art, however, will readily
      recognize that probe 308 may be placed in contact with the oil
      and/or other fluids within engine block 202 in any of a number
      ways, and that inserting probe 308 into a portion of hose 310 is
      but one non-limiting example of exposing the oil and/or other
      fluids within engine block 202 to probe 308. As another
      non-limiting example, an opening or port (not shown) may be
      created in engine block 202 and probe 308 may be inserted into
      engine block 202 through this opening so as to be placed in
      contact with the oil within engine block 202.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that the energy generated by alternator 220 is
      transmitted through mechanism 300 to the oil circulating within
      engine block 202. It is further believed that the energy
      transmitted to the oil conditions the oil, changing one or more
      characteristics or properties of the oil. These characteristics or
      properties may be physical and/or chemical, and may include, but
      are not limited to, viscosity, pour point, and flash point. While
      not being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that
      conditioning the oil within engine block 202 compresses the oil's
      molecules and creates an energy field about the oil, which leads
      to magnetizing engine 200. Once magnetized, engine 200 may be
      surrounded by a magnetic field 280, which may extend to fuel tank
      226 and, in some embodiments, surround all metallic components
      associated with engine 200. It is also believed that conditioning
      the oil results in the oil circulating through engine 200 at an
      increased rate, which in turn facilitates increased removal of
      heat from engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] It is known that an engine 200 becomes magnetized because a
      magnetic field has been detected at an engine constructed in
      accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. In
      particular, both a compass and a gauss meter were used to detect
      the presence of a magnetic field at an engine constructed in
      accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. The
      gauss meter detected a magnetic field of approximately -8 to 15
      gauss at the engine constructed in accordance with the principles
      of the present disclosure. However, those of ordinary skill in the
      art will readily recognize that an engine 200 having a magnetic
      field of greater or lesser intensity than the field measured may
      enhance the benefits afforded by the principles of the present
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] With renewed reference to FIG. 2, an engine 200 in
      accordance with the present disclosure further includes a fuel
      tank 226. Fuel tank 226 may be substantially similar to fuel tank
      126. Unlike fuel tank 126, however, fuel tank 226 may be
      positioned in a plane disposed above a plane of carburetor 222, as
      shown, so that fuel 224 may flow to carburetor 222 under the
      influences of gravity, magnetic field 280, and/or the
      aforementioned vacuum typically maintained within engine 200,
      eliminating the need to pump fuel 224 to carburetor 222 by
      increasing the pressure of fuel 224. In other words, fuel 224 may
      be gravity fed to carburetor 222.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Carburetor 222 may include any suitable up-draft,
      side-draft, down-draft, or fuel injection body. As a non-limiting
      example, carburetor 222 may include, but is not limited to, the
      Performer Series(R) Carburetors manufactured by Edelbrock
      Corporation. Specifically, such Edelbrock carburetors may include
      any of the 1403-1407 and 1408-1413 Performer Series(R)
      Carburetors. As further non-limiting examples, carburetor 222 may
      include any suitable carburetor manufactured by Zenith Fuel
      Systems LLC or Stomberg.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Fuel 224 may travel to carburetor 222 via a fuel line 228.
      Fuel line 228 may be substantially similar to fuel line 128
      discussed above. In some embodiments, however, fuel line 228 may
      include nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, known silver alloys,
      or any combination thereof. As a non-limiting example, an exterior
      and/or interior of fuel line 228 may be coated with nickel,
      silver, known nickel alloys, known silver alloys, or any
      combination thereof. As another non-limiting example, embodiments
      of fuel line 228 may be constructed with embedded particulates of
      nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, known silver alloys, or any
      combination thereof. As a further non-limiting example,
      embodiments of fuel line 228 may include one or more inserts (not
      shown) having nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, known silver
      alloys, or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 5, the flow of fuel 224 within
      fuel line 228 may be controlled or regulated by any suitable means
      known in the art, so that a constant flow, rather than a pulsed or
      otherwise irregular flow, of fuel 224 may be supplied to
      carburetor 222. As a non-limiting example, fuel line 228 may be
      provided with one or more valves 160. Valves 160 may include any
      suitable valves known in the art. In some embodiments, valves 160
      may include needle valves. In the illustrated embodiment, it is
      contemplated that fuel line 228 may be provided with at least two
      needle valves 160, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Since the use and operation of a needle valve is widely
      known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a detailed
      description of needle valves 160 is omitted in the interests of
      brevity. For the purposes of discussion, however, needle valves
      160 may control the flow of fuel 224 within fuel line 228 by
      moving a lower portion 162 of needle 161 in the directions
      indicated by arrow 164. Specifically, when portion 162 is in the
      shown lowered position, portion 162 may impede the flow of fuel
      224 past valve 160. When portion 162 is raised, however, the fuel
      flow pathway within fuel line 228 may be unimpeded.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Needle valves 160 may include any suitable needle valves
      known in the art, such as, for example, without limitation,
      commercially available stainless steel needle valves. In
      accordance with the principles of the present disclosure, however,
      each of needle valves 160 may include a core insert 166. Insert
      166 may be fabricated by any known processes, such as, for
      example, without limitation, casting or extrusion. Further, insert
      166 may have any desired cross-sectional shape and/or
      configuration. As a non-limiting example, insert 166 may have a
      substantially circular cross-section. In addition, insert 166 may
      also have one or more cross-sectional shapes and/or configurations
      along its length, and may have any desired dimension suitable for
      insertion into needle 161. As a non-limiting example, insert 166
      may be configured to extend longitudinally within needle 161, such
      that insert 166 may be disposed within the portion of lower
      portion 162 closest to fuel 224 within fuel line 228. Insert 166
      may have a material composition different from the material
      composition of valve 160. As a non-limiting example, in the
      illustrated embodiments, insert 166 may be fabricated from one of
      nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, known silver alloys, or any
      combination thereof. In addition, various configurations of wired
      grids of nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, known silver alloys,
      or any combination thereof may be secured to various surfaces of
      engine block 202, radiator 214, and/or any fluid reservoir or
      line. Such grids may be secured by any suitable means, including,
      but not limited to, soldering, welding, and/or mechanical
      fastening.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that allowing fuel 224 to be gravity fed to carburetor
      222, without the pressure increases provided by a fuel pump,
      facilitates complete exposure of fuel 224 to magnetic field 280 of
      engine 200, so as to promote magnetization of fuel 224 before it
      is supplied to carburetor 222. It is further believed that
      magnetization of fuel 224 alters the combustion characteristics of
      fuel 224, so as to increase fuel economy as well as reduce the
      pollutants introduced into the atmosphere as a result of exhaust
      gas emissions. In general, it is believed that these advantageous
      results are obtained by changes in fuel 224, including, but not
      limited to, changes in viscosity, boiling points, magnetic
      susceptibility, electrical conductivity, volatility, atomization,
      flammability, rate of oxidation, and surface tension.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As used herein, the term "combustion characteristics"
      includes, but is not limited to, the expansion produced by the
      fuel in the combustion chambers of an engine; the revolutions per
      minute (RPM) of the engine produced by the combustion of a fuel;
      the parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and
      other combustion by-products in the exhaust of the engine; the
      miles per gallon achieved using the fuel; and the temperature of
      the exhaust stream from the engine. The combustion characteristics
      of a fuel indicate the efficiency and completeness with which a
      fuel burns and indicate the power produced or work achieved by the
      engine using the fuel. The combustion characteristics of a fuel
      are considered to be improved when, among other things, the fuel
      produces small quantities of carbon dioxide and other exhaustion
      products, when the miles per gallon achieved with the fuel
      increases, when the temperature of the engine exhaust decreases,
      and when the engine efficiency, torque, and RPM increase.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] While not being bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that fuel 224 may be polarized by exposure to magnetism.
      The effect of such exposure is believed to be the production of a
      moment created by the movement of the outer electrons of a
      hydrocarbon chain to states of higher principal quantum number.
      This movement, it is believed, breaks down the fixed valence
      electrons that partake in the bonding process of fuel compounds,
      thereby creating the condition for freer association of fuel
      particulates. In doing so, fuel 224 becomes directionalized or
      aligned, which does not necessarily create new hydrocarbon chains
      within fuel 224, but aligns the conduced magnetic moment into a
      dipole relationship within itself. This magnetic alignment then
      permits rapid bonding with respective oxidizing media, such as,
      for example, air. The result of which is, of course, an
      improvement in the combustion characteristics of fuel 224 and more
      complete and efficient burning of fuel 224.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Increased oxidation of fuel 224 is believed to cause
      several effects. In particular, faster and more complete oxidation
      of fuel 224 may result in more rapid and more complete combustion
      of fuel 224. More efficient combustion may create a more
      concentrated and more forceful driving force on the pistons (not
      shown) of engine 200, which results in the desirable effect of
      increasing the RPM of engine 200 for the same amount of fuel
      burned. The net effect is believed to be increased power and/or a
      corresponding decrease in fuel consumption for a given power
      output.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Another effect of increased oxidation is believed to be a
      reduction in the toxic compounds, such as, for example, NO-x,
      produced during combustion of fuel 224. Although an increase in
      combustion temperature is generally associated with an increase in
      the formation of NO-x, production of NO-x is believed to be
      reduced because of a reduction in combustion burn time. In
      addition, the increased heat produced during the combustion
      process is more rapidly dissipated by increased gas expansion and
      heat transfer through conductance to a greater available surface
      area.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] As alluded to above, magnetization of fuel 224 is believed
      to condition fuel 224 so as to permit entry of energy into fuel
      224. Further, it is believed to break down the bonds between the
      hydrocarbon chains of fuel 224. This results in decreased density
      and, thus, smaller particulars and droplets during atomization or
      injection within an internal combustion engine. Smaller particles
      and droplets cause changes in evaporation rate, improved mixing of
      fuel 224 and air, and improved promotion of oxidation. The net
      effect is believed to be an increase in the rate of combustion, an
      increase in power, and reduced pollutant formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that the combustion characteristics of fuel 224 are
      further improved by an electrochemical, quasi-catalytic reaction
      promoted by the presence of nickel, silver, known nickel alloys,
      or known silver alloys within needle valves 160. Specifically, it
      is believed that exposing fuel 224 to magnetic field 280 saturates
      fuel 224 with negative ions, effectively converting fuel 224 into
      a plasma fuel, as discussed below. Thus, since the net charges of
      the hydrocarbon molecules of fuel 224 and oxygen may be both
      negative, repulsive forces instead of attractive forces may exist
      between molecules of fuel and air. These repulsive forces tend to
      keep the hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules separated. It is
      therefore believed that the presence of nickel, silver, known
      nickel alloys, or known silver alloys within needle valves 160
      serves to promote ionization of fuel 224 as it flows past needle
      valves 160. The ionization of fuel 224 is believed to (1)
      facilitate the cracking of the complex hydrocarbon molecules in
      fuel 224, and/or (2) create a hydrocarbon fuel with a net positive
      charge. It is further believed that the effect of ionizing the
      hydrocarbons within fuel 224 causes them to aggressively attract
      and bond with available oxygen, thereby increasing the
      combustibility of fuel 224.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In tested embodiments, it was observed that the fuel 224
      being supplied to carburetor 222 was at a temperature of
      approximately -40[deg.] F. This temperature was measured in fuel
      line 228 at a location proximal to carburetor 222 by a digital
      thermometer. Further, it was observed that the fuel mixture within
      carburetor 222 was at a temperature of at least -100[deg.] F. This
      temperature was also measured with a digital thermometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The resultant fuel supplied to carburetor 222 appears to
      have characteristics of an ion saturated fuel, and thus will be
      referred to herein as "ionized fuel." As discussed below, it is
      further believed that the ionized fuel being supplied to
      carburetor 222 may combine with air to create a plasma because a
      bluish or whitish plume or glow, which is typically associated
      with plasma, such as, for example, cold plasma, has been observed
      in one of carburetor 222 and engine block 102, in embodiments that
      have been tested. However, since the chemical and/or other
      characteristics of the ionized fuel have not been completely
      characterized, the term "ionized fuel" as used herein is simply
      used as a title to refer to fuel conditioned as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In tested embodiments, it was observed that an engine
      constructed in accordance with the principles of the present
      disclosure maintains a vacuum of approximately 26-30 Hg, which is
      significantly higher than the aforementioned 18 Hg typically
      maintained by conventional internal combustion engines. In some
      embodiments, this increased vacuum may be maintained by any
      suitable means, including, for example, without limitation,
      adjusting the positioning of one or both of throttle plate 238 and
      lower plate 240. Without wishing to be bound by any particular
      theory, it is believed that the increased vacuum maintained by
      engine 200 may not only facilitate improved mixing of ionized fuel
      and air but also facilitate faster introduction of the air/plasma
      fuel mixture into engine block 202 from carburetor 222.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] As those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize,
      engine 200 may include a plurality of fasteners 290, 292, such as,
      for example, without limitation, bolts or screws. These fasteners
      290, 292 may serve to secure various components of engine 200 to
      one another. In the illustrated embodiment, fasteners 290, 292 may
      be used to secure carburetor 222 to engine block 202. To further
      promote ionization of fuel 224, it is contemplated that one or
      more of fasteners 290, 292 may include a core insert made of
      nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, or known silver alloys. As
      with needle valves 160, it is believed that increasing the
      exposure of fuel 224 to nickel or silver components may serve to
      further improve the combustion characteristics of fuel 224 through
      the electrochemical, quasi-catalytic reaction discussed above.
      Indeed, the principles of the present disclosure account for
      providing engine 200 with any suitable number of fasteners with
      inserts made of nickel, silver, known nickel alloys, or known
      silver alloys.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] As alluded to above, delivering ionized fuel to carburetor
      222 results in either a decrease in fuel combustion for a given
      output or a corresponding increase in power output for a given
      rate of fuel consumption. For certain internal combustion engine
      applications, such as, for example, applications in vehicles, an
      increase in power output may be undesirable. Instead, it may be
      preferred to maintain a given power output while reducing fuel
      consumption. In such cases, it may become necessary to selectively
      limit the flow of fuel 224 to carburetor 222, since excess fuel
      may flood carburetor 222 and cause engine 200 to stall. As alluded
      to above, the flow of fuel 224 from fuel tank 226 to carburetor
      222 may be selectively controlled by needle valves 160. Of course,
      however, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize
      that any suitable means of controlling the flow of fuel 224 within
      fuel line 228 may be utilized with the principles of the present
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] As a consequence of reducing the flow of fuel 224 to
      carburetor 222, less air may be needed to combust the ionized fuel
      being supplied to carburetor 222. As those of ordinary skill in
      the art will recognize, providing carburetor 222 with more air
      than necessary may result in choking engine 200. Therefore, it may
      be necessary to limit the quantity of air being supplied to
      carburetor 222. The flow of air to carburetor 222 may be
      controlled by any suitable manner known in the art. As a
      non-limiting example, air flow into carburetor 222 may be
      controlled by adjusting throttle plate 238. In addition, or
      alternatively, the flow of air into engine 200 may be controlled
      by adjusting the dimensions of the air intake mechanism (not
      shown) of engine 200. As a non-limiting example, an opening into
      which atmospheric air flows may be reduced in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In some embodiments, the ionized fuel introduced into
      carburetor 222 may be so potent that it may not be necessary to
      mix the ion saturated fuel with air to create a suitable
      combustion mixture. Instead, the principles of the present
      disclosure contemplate combining air entering into carburetor 222
      with ion saturated fuel vapors to create a plasma fuel/air mixture
      suitable for combustion. It is believed that conditioning the fuel
      as described above and exposing the ionized fuel to air
      facilitates a phase change of the ion saturated fuel vapors and
      the creation of plasma, such as, for example, cold plasma. The air
      entering carburetor 222 may be combined with ion saturated fuel
      vapors in any suitable manner. In the illustrated embodiment, it
      is contemplated that the ionized fuel level within the float
      chamber (not shown) of carburetor 222 may be reduced so that the
      fuel-side opening of the mixing tube (not shown) of carburetor 222
      is not submerged in liquid ion saturated fuel. Reducing the liquid
      ionized fuel level within the float chamber of carburetor 222 may
      be accomplished by any suitable means known in the art. As a
      non-limiting example, one or more characteristics of the float of
      carburetor 222 may be modified to permit the float chamber to
      maintain a reduced level of liquid ionized fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that reducing the ionized fuel level below the fuel-side
      opening of the mixing tube of carburetor 222 allows the air
      entering carburetor 222 to draw only ion saturated fuel vapors
      into the throat of carburetor 222 from its float chamber. The ion
      saturated fuel vapors drawn into the throat then combine with the
      air flowing in the throat to form a plasma fuel/air mixture
      according to the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] As alluded to above, engine 200 may include a cooling
      system 203 made up of a thermostat 208 (which will be discussed in
      greater detail below), a fan 210, a water pump 212, and a radiator
      214. Water pump 212 functions to circulate a cooling fluid (not
      shown) between engine block 202 and radiator 214. As noted above,
      the cooling fluid may include water, a mixture of water and
      ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), which is also known as antifreeze, or
      any other suitable cooling fluid known in the art. Radiator 214
      may function as a heat exchanger and transfer heat from the
      cooling fluid flowing from engine block 202 to the air blowing
      through radiator 214 by fan 210. Thermostat 208 may function to
      regulate the rate of cooling fluid flowing from engine 202 to
      radiator 214. The cooling fluid is circulated between engine block
      202 and radiator 214 by an upper hose 216 and a lower hose 218.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is
      believed that the exposure of the cooling fluid circulating within
      engine block 202 to magnetic field 280 and/or fasteners having
      inserts containing nickel or silver, such as, for example,
      fasteners 290, 292, conditions the cooling fluid circulating
      between engine block 202 and radiator 214. In particular, it is
      believed that exposing the cooling fluid to magnetic field 280 may
      induce many physicochemical changes in the cooling fluid. These
      changes include, but are not limited to, changes in viscosity,
      solubility, boiling point, magnetic susceptibility, electrical
      conductivity, and surface tension. It is further believed that the
      changes induced in the cooling fluid circulating between engine
      block 202 and radiator 214 may serve to condition cooling fluid in
      a manner so as to increase the overall efficiency of cooling
      system 203. Stated differently, it is believed that cooling fluid
      conditioned in this manner is capable of removing heat from within
      engine block 202 at a faster rate than cooling fluid that has not
      been conditioned by magnetic field 280 and/or exposure to nickel,
      silver, or alloys thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In some embodiments, however, it may be desirable to cool
      engine block 202 at a rate faster than that possible with
      conditioned cooling fluid, given that commonly employed
      thermostats may not be capable of opening at the lower operating
      temperatures of an engine in accordance with the principles of the
      present disclosure. To accommodate faster cooling of engine block
      202 in some embodiments, it may be desirable to replace the
      existing cooling fluid with a cooling fluid having greater heat
      capacity. In other embodiments, however, it may be desirable to
      increase the flow rate of the cooling fluid. The cooling fluid
      flow rate may be increased by modifying thermostat 208 in a manner
      that allows a greater volume of cooling fluid to flow through
      thermostat 208. As a non-limiting example, the area of thermostat
      208 through which cooling fluid flows may be made larger, or one
      or more bypass pathways may be provided. In the embodiments
      tested, a plurality of additional cooling fluid flow pathways were
      created to, for example, without limitation, facilitate a greater
      flow rate of cooling fluid between engine block 202 and radiator
      214. The plurality of fluid flow pathways may also facilitate
      cooling fluid flow through thermostat 208 even if thermostat 208
      inhibits normal cooling fluid flow by remaining in the closed
      position. Stated differently, in some embodiments, the plurality
      of fluid flow pathways may allow the cooling fluid to bypass the
      closed thermostat 208. Such pathways may be created by any
      suitable measures known in the art, including drilling, and may be
      of any suitable dimension and configuration. In the tested
      embodiment, four holes were drilled around the normal cooling
      fluid flow pathway in a thermostat 208. Each of the drilled holes
      included a dimension of 0.125 inches. Of course, those of ordinary
      skill in the art will recognize that thermostat 208 may also be
      replaced with another thermostat that provides not only
      appropriate rate of coolant flow but also appropriate resistances
      of the cooling fluid flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Again, without wishing to be bound by any particular
      theory, it is believed that faster cooling of engine 200, along
      with the improved combustion characteristics of the plasma fuel
      being delivered to engine 200, allows engine 200 to operate more
      efficiently by consuming less fuel for a given power output and/or
      producing more power for a given consumption of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In some embodiments, the benefits realized as a result of
      the principles of the present disclosure may be enhanced by one or
      more modifications to the designs of conventional internal
      combustion engines. In particular, one or more components of a
      conventional internal combustion engine may be added, removed,
      and/or combined to create an engine in accordance with the present
      disclosure. As a non-limiting example, it is contemplated that the
      various fluid-containing devices in an engine (e.g., 200) may be
      combined to enhance the benefits realized as a result of the
      principles of the present disclosure. As a non-limiting example, a
      radiator, transmission cooler, engine oil cooler, and a power
      steering fluid reservoir may be combined to achieve enhanced
      benefits. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it
      is believed that locating fluid-containing devices close to one
      another may serve to enhance the benefits described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] As discussed above, the principles of the present
      disclosure provide for altering the combustion characteristics,
      such as, for example, without limitation, flammability of fuel
      224. As a result of supplying plasma fuel to carburetor 222, the
      intensity of the spark required to ignite the final plasma
      fuel/air mixture introduced into engine block 202 may be dependent
      on the combustion characteristics of the mixture. Therefore, it
      may be necessary to selectively control the intensity of the spark
      provided to ignite the plasma fuel/air mixture. The intensity of
      the spark provided may be controlled by any suitable manner known
      in the art. In some embodiments, the intensity of the spark
      provided may be controlled by limiting the electrical current
      supplied to the spark plugs (not shown) of engine 200. The
      electrical current supplied to the spark plugs may be limited by
      any suitable means known in the art. As a non-limiting example, it
      is contemplated that a resistance, including, but not limited to,
      the resistance provided by a commercially available rheostat, may
      be used to reduce the current provided to the spark plugs of
      engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In embodiments where engine 200 may include a gasoline
      spark-fired internal combustion engine utilizing an ignition
      mechanism to ignite the fuel, it is believed that the current
      provided to the ignition mechanism (not shown) of engine 200 may
      be reduced by up to approximately 1,000,000 percent, in order to
      produce a spark that will ignite the plasma fuel/air mixture
      completely. By way of a non-limiting example, it is known that
      some automobiles provide a current of approximately 3 to 5 amps to
      the ignition mechanism of the automobile's conventional internal
      combustion engine. Providing 3 to 5 amps to the ignition mechanism
      generates a spark large enough to ignite gasoline, for example.
      Should the engine be configured in accordance with the present
      disclosure, however, it is believed that the current supplied to
      the ignition mechanism may be reduced to approximately 0.003 mA to
      result in an ignition mechanism still able to produce a spark that
      will ignite the plasma fuel/air mixture completely. The
      aforementioned ignition mechanism may include any suitable
      ignition mechanism known in the art. As a non-limiting example,
      the ignition mechanism of some gasoline engine embodiments may
      include, among other things, a coil and a plurality of spark
      plugs. In other embodiments, the ignition mechanism may simply
      include, among other things, an elongate conductive wire, or any
      other suitable means of providing a spark to the plasma fuel/air
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is
      believed that the exhaust gases 251 leaving engine block 202 may
      include, for example, carbon monoxide, unburned fuel, unburned
      carbon, soot, and/or oil vapor. To, among other things, reduce the
      quantity of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, and
      potentially further increase the efficiency of engine 200, the
      present disclosure contemplates processing the exhaust gases 251
      leaving engine block 202 before they may be released into the
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In accordance with the present disclosure, therefore,
      engine 200 may be provided with a mechanism 250/250a for
      processing the exhaust gases 251 leaving engine block 202, as
      shown in FIGS. 4A-4C. Mechanism 250/250a may include any suitable
      mechanism for removing fuel particulates, unburned hydrocarbon
      molecules, and other harmful compounds from the exhaust gases 251
      leaving engine block 202. In the illustrated non-limiting
      examples, mechanism 250/250a may include an exhaust hose or pipe
      232a extending from an exhaust manifold (not shown) of engine
      block 202. Pipe 232a may be used to transport exhaust gases 251
      away from engine block 202 and into reclamation device 252.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Reclamation device 252 may include any suitable device for
      reclaiming and/or recycling particulates from exhaust gases 251.
      Reclamation device 252 may be made of any suitable material, such
      as, for example, stainless steel. Further, reclamation device 252
      may be fabricated by any known process, such as, for example,
      extrusion and/or welding. Additionally, it is contemplated that
      reclamation device 252 may include any suitable, desired shape
      and/or dimensions. In one non-limiting example, reclamation device
      252 may include a diameter of 16.5 inches. In addition, as shown
      in FIG. 4A, reclamation device 252 may include an upper depth
      dimension B of approximately 4.25 inches, and a lower depth
      dimension A of approximately 3 inches. With specific reference to
      FIG. 4B, in some embodiments, pipe 232a may include a length C of
      approximately 4.5 inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] With renewed reference to FIGS. 4A-4B, exhaust gases 251
      leaving engine block 202 may enter reclamation device 252 via pipe
      232a. Exhaust gases 251 may be directed to the outer peripheries
      of reclamation device 252 by any suitable geometrical structures
      within reclamation device 252. In one non-limiting example,
      reclamation device 252 may include internal structures 232a' and
      232a'' for directing gases 251 towards an outer wall of
      reclamation device 252. Structure 232a' may include an elongated
      plate extending from an end of pipe 232a. In addition, structure
      232a'' may include a curved plate extending from structure 232a'.
      Structures 232a' and 232a'' may include any shape and/or
      dimensions suitable for directing exhaust gases 251. For example,
      structure 232a'' may include a curvature similar to that of an
      outer wall of reclamation device 252. Furthermore, structure 232a'
      may include a length dimension C of approximately 3 inches, and
      structure 232a'' may include a length dimension D of approximately
      1 inch. Still further, structures 232a' and 232a'' may be made of
      any suitable material, such as, for example, stainless steel.
      Moreover, structures 232a' and 232a'' may be fabricated by any
      suitable process known in the art, including, but not limited to,
      welding and/or extrusion. Reclamation device 252 may further
      include an exhaust outlet 232c for allowing exhaust gases 251
      within reclamation device 252 to exit reclamation device 252.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Reclamation device 252 may further include a plurality of
      exhaust transmission lines 234, 235, and 236. Each of lines 234,
      235, and 236 may include any hose or piping configuration suitable
      for transporting exhaust particulates leaving the exhaust gases
      251 away from reclamation device 252. As a non-limiting example,
      lines 234, 235, and 236 may have substantially circular
      cross-sectional configurations. Further, lines 234, 235, and 236
      may be made of any material suitable for transporting the exhaust
      particulates. In some embodiments, lines 234, 235, and 236 may
      share one or more physical or geometric characteristics with
      exhaust pipe 232a and/or exhaust outlet 232c. Further, although
      the illustrated embodiments depict each of lines 234, 235, and 236
      as being substantially similar to one another, those of ordinary
      skill in the art will readily recognize that lines 234, 235, and
      236 may differ from each other in, for example, without
      limitation, geometry and/or composition. Moreover, each of lines
      234, 235, and 236 may include any suitable dimensions. As a
      non-limiting example, in some embodiments, lines 234, 235, and 236
      may include a diameter of 0.0625 inches. Lines 234, 235, and 236
      may be connected to reclamation device 252 by any suitable manner
      known in the art. As a non-limiting example, lines 234, 235, and
      236 may be connected to reclamation device 252 through openings or
      ports (not shown) provided in reclamation device 252. Regardless
      of the means of connection to reclamation device 252, it is
      contemplated that the connection between each of lines 234, 235,
      and 236 and reclamation device 252 may be substantially airtight
      so as to avoid any undesired leakage of exhaust gases 251 and/or
      particulates removed from the exhaust gases 251.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Lines 234, 235, and 236 may be used to recycle particulates
      (e.g., unburned hydrocarbon molecules) removed from exhaust gases
      251 by reclamation device 252. In particular, it is contemplated
      that the particulates removed from exhaust gases 251 may be
      returned to engine 200 to further improve the overall fuel
      efficiency of engine 200. The particulates removed through lines
      234, 235, and 236 may be returned to any suitable portion of
      engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] With renewed reference to FIG. 2, it is contemplated that
      the particulates removed by line 234 may be returned to, for
      example, without limitation, fuel tank 226; the particulates
      removed by line 235 may be returned to engine 200 through, for
      example, without limitation, intake manifold 202a; and the
      particulates removed by line 236 may be returned to engine 200
      through, for example, without limitation, an air intake of
      carburetor 222.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The exit pressure of exhaust gases 251 may be sufficient,
      in some embodiments, to push the removed particulates through
      lines 234, 235, and 236 and back to engine 200. In other
      embodiments, however, a motive force, such as, for example,
      without limitation, a vacuum, may be needed to assist in the
      transportation of particulates through lines 234, 235, and 236. A
      vacuum may be generated in lines 234, 235, and 236 by any
      suitable, conventional means. As a non-limiting example, a vacuum
      pump (not shown) may be utilized to facilitate the transmission of
      particulates through lines 234, 235, and 236. Alternatively, the
      aforementioned increased vacuum pressure generated within engine
      200 may be harnessed to facilitate the transmission of
      particulates through lines 234, 235, and 236.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In the embodiments tested, the temperature of the exhaust
      gases 251 leaving engine 200 and entering reclamation device 252
      was measured to be between approximately 285[deg.] F. to 350[deg.]
      F. Further, it was observed that the exhaust gases 251 cooled as
      they traveled through reclamation device 252 to exhaust outlet
      232c. In some embodiments, the temperature of exhaust gases 251 as
      they approached line 235 were measured to be between approximately
      165[deg.] F. to 212[deg.] F. Further, as the exhaust gases 251
      approached line 236, the temperature of the exhaust gases 251 was
      measured to be between approximately 118[deg.] F. to 122[deg.] F.
      Finally, the temperature of the exhaust gases 251 leaving exhaust
      outlet 232c was measured to be approximately 95[deg.] F. The
      temperatures noted in this paragraph were measured with a digital
      thermometer on embodiments constructed in accordance with the
      principles of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] While not being bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that reclamation device 252 functions as a distilling or
      refining apparatus for exhaust gases 251. In particular, the
      construction of reclamation device 252, and the strategic
      placement of lines 234, 235, and 236, may help to remove
      hydrocarbon molecules of differing molecular weights from exhaust
      gases 251. Specifically, it is believed that as exhaust gases 251
      at ~310[deg.] F. enter reclamation device 252, the heavier
      hydrocarbon molecules within exhaust gases 251 are still in a
      gaseous state and therefore light enough to be extracted into line
      234. As the exhaust gases 251 travel to the location of line 235,
      it is believed that the temperature of exhaust gases 251 may cool
      to ~200[deg.] F. At this temperature, it is believed that the
      heavier hydrocarbon molecules may no longer be light enough to be
      extracted from exhaust gases 251, but that the next lighter group
      of hydrocarbon clusters may still be in a completely gaseous state
      and therefore light enough to be extracted into line 235.
      Similarly, as the exhaust gases 251 travel to the location of line
      236, it is believed that the temperature of exhaust gases 251 is
      reduced to ~118[deg.] F. At this temperature, the middle (and
      heaviest) group of hydrocarbon molecules may no longer be light
      enough to be extracted from exhaust gases 251, but that the next
      lighter group of hydrocarbon clusters may still be in a completely
      gaseous state and therefore light enough to be extracted into line
      236.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] It is believed that processing exhaust gases 251 in this
      manner facilitates the removal of, among other things, unused
      hydrocarbon molecules, unburned fuel, and other harmful pollutants
      from exhaust gases 251. The unused hydrocarbon molecules and fuel
      may be returned to engine 200 as discussed above. Further, it is
      believed that processing exhaust gases 251 in the manner discussed
      above may serve to reduce the quantities of toxic compounds
      ultimately leaving engine 200. In some embodiments, reclamation
      device 252 may completely cleanse exhaust gases 251 so that only
      ionized air at approximately 95[deg.] F. may be ultimately
      discharged as exhaust from engine 200 via exhaust outlet 232c.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Referring to FIG. 4C, another embodiment of an exhaust
      reclamation device is depicted as reclamation device 252a.
      Reclamation device 252a may be substantially similar to
      reclamation device 252 of FIGS. 4A-4B. Reclamation device 252a,
      however, may include one or more internal geometrical structures
      for assisting in the removal of particulates from exhaust gases
      251. In the depicted embodiment, reclamation device 252 may
      include a conduit or pipe 232b connecting an outlet of pipe 232a
      to an inlet of exhaust outlet 232c. Pipe 232b may also serve to
      direct exhaust gases 251 from pipe 232a to exhaust outlet 232c and
      past lines 234-236, as shown in FIG. 4C. As also shown in FIG. 4C,
      pipe 232b may include a plurality of openings 233. Openings 233
      may be of any suitable configuration. As a non-limiting example,
      openings 233 may be substantially circular. Further, openings 233
      may have any suitable dimension for facilitating the removal of
      particulates from exhaust gases 251. The particulates leaving
      exhaust gases 251 may enter one or more of lines 234, 235, and
      236, as discussed above in connection with FIGS. 4A-4B.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Although the principles of the present disclosure have been
      discussed relative to engine 200 having a carburetor 222, those of
      ordinary skill will readily recognize that the benefits of the
      principles described herein may be also realized by engines that
      do not include carburetors. Such engines may include, but are not
      limited to, engines utilizing alternative fuel delivery
      mechanisms. As a non-limiting example, as shown in FIG. 3, engine
      200a may be substantially similar to engine 200, but may include a
      fuel injection system 201 instead of a carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] As alluded to above, the principles of the present
      disclosure contemplate selectively controlling a number of
      differing parameters within engine 200. These parameters may
      include, but are not limited to, the flow of fuel from fuel tank
      226 to carburetor 222, the flow of energy from alternator 220 to
      the oil within engine block 202, the flow of air entering engine
      200, the flow of exhaust gases 251 through mechanism 250, and the
      flow of cooling fluid between radiator 214 and engine block 202.
      While these various parameters may be controlled in any number of
      different manners, those of ordinary skill will readily recognize
      that engine 200 may be provided with a plurality of suitable
      sensors (not shown) and a central processing unit (CPU) (not
      shown) so as to automate the control of these exemplary
      parameters. Further, one or more of the aforementioned parameters
      may be selectively programmable by an external console, which may
      be maintained at, for example, a gas station, mechanic, and/or an
      automobile dealership. The external console may include any
      suitable CPU or microprocessor known in the art. In embodiments
      where an internal combustion engine according to the principles of
      the present disclosure is utilized in non-vehicular applications,
      the external console may be portable for transport to the engine's
      location. In addition to programming the control of engine 200, an
      external console according to the principles of the present
      disclosure may be utilized for, among other things, diagnostics
      and/or tuning of an engine 200. Those of ordinary skill will also
      recognize that engine 200 may include a plurality of sensors (not
      shown) to facilitate in the diagnosis of engine 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Those of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that
      the principles of the present disclosure and the embodiments
      described herein may be incorporated into any suitable internal
      combustion engine. As a non-limiting example, it is contemplated
      that the principles of the present disclosure may be used to
      modify or retrofit existing engines to improve the overall
      performance and efficiency of such engines. The principles of the
      present disclosure may also be incorporated into new engines to
      produce engines of increased efficiency and performance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0119] In order to verify the principles of the present
      disclosure, the embodiments described herein were implemented as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0120] A 1988, 305 cubic inch, V8 engine installed in a 1979 GMC
      pickup truck was retrofitted in accordance with the principles of
      the present disclosure. The engine was supplied with gasoline
      having an octane rating of 87, and included a Quadrajet carburetor
      having an electric choke. Prior to modifying the engine with the
      principles of the present disclosure, an average gas mileage of
      16-18 mpg was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In accordance with some of the aforementioned embodiments,
      the engine of this truck was modified in the following manner.
      First, energies were delivered from the alternator of the truck's
      engine to the oil circulating within the truck's engine block. A
      Lutron switch was utilized to control the flow of energies to the
      engine's oil, as discussed above. The energies were delivered to
      the engine's oil via a stainless steel probe connected to a wire
      made of 12 gauge copper. Second, a rheostat was installed to limit
      the current supplied to the coil of the engine's ignition system.
      Third, the main gas lines were rerouted so that there was a first
      supply line to the carburetor and a second supply line from the
      fill neck of the gasoline tank to the carburetor. The flow within
      these supply lines was controlled by needle valves. Fourth, the
      flow of air into the carburetor was regulated by adjusting the
      position of the choke plate. Fifth, the fuel level in the
      carburetor was lowered to approximately [1/8] inch, so that the
      fuel-side opening of the mixing tube was not submerged in liquid
      fuel, as also discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] During testing of the engine with the first through third
      modifications noted above, it was observed that, among other
      things, fuel consumption decreased by approximately 25% when the
      engine was operating at approximately 1800 to 2100 rpm, and the
      truck was driving at speeds of approximately 60-70 mph. In
      particular, it was observed that the truck was achieving an
      average gas mileage of approximately 22-24 mpg when traveling
      distances of approximately 100 miles. These data were verified by
      four additional 100 mile tests and the results of each test were
      within 2% of each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] During testing of the engine with each of the modifications
      noted above, it was observed that fuel consumption was greatly
      reduced. In particular, it was observed that the truck was
      achieving an average gas mileage of approximately 60 mpg when the
      engine was operating at approximately 1800-2600 rpm and at speeds
      of approximately 60-80 mph. These data were verified by four
      additional 100 mile tests, and the results of each test were
      within 3% of each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Further, a measurement of the magnetic fields in and around
      the engine revealed that the fuel tank possessed a magnetic field
      of approximately +2.0 to +3.0 gauss at the top of the fuel tank
      and -5.0 gauss at the bottom of the tank. In addition, the engine
      was examined after 500 hours of use and no signs of wear were
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0125] A 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 Quadcab diesel truck having a weight
      of 9826 lbs was retrofitted in accordance with embodiments of the
      present disclosure. The truck included a four wheel drive
      configuration and a six (6) cylinder, 5.7 liter engine. Prior to
      modifying the engine with the principles of the present
      disclosure, an average gas mileage of 13 mpg was observed for this
      truck. Further, black smoke was observed from the exhaust upon
      acceleration. In addition, during normal operation, an average
      approximate radiator temperature of 195[deg.] F. was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In accordance with some of the aforementioned embodiments,
      energies were delivered from the alternator of the truck's engine
      to the oil circulating within the truck's engine block. In
      particular, one end of a 10 gauge, 19 strand, THNN copper wire was
      connected to the positive pole of the alternator. The other end of
      this wire was connected to a Lutron switch, as described above. A
      second 10 gauge, 19 strand, THNN copper wire connected the Lutron
      switch to the engine's oil sending unit. The second wire was
      secured to the oil sending unit with a conventional alligator
      clip.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Once the truck's engine was modified in the manner
      described above, it was observed that the radiator operated at
      much cooler temperatures. In particular, an average radiator
      operating temperature of approximately 100[deg.] F.-110[deg.] F.
      was observed. Further, driving tests of the truck revealed an
      observable diesel mileage of approximately 30-32 mpg. In addition,
      the exhaust of the truck no longer emitted the black smoke
      previously observed upon acceleration, indicating a significant
      reduction in exhaust particulates. Moreover, it was observed that
      engine sound had diminished considerably. In particular, it was
      noted that the diesel engine was emitting sounds comparable to
      those of a conventional gasoline engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] Further, from a stopped position, the truck was able to
      travel 0.25 miles in 14.5 seconds. According to routine
      calculations based on the truck's weight and the time the truck
      took to travel 0.25 miles, it is estimated that the truck's engine
      was producing approximately 825-875 hp and 1100-1200 ft/lbs of
      torque. During this test, improved acceleration response was also
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0129] A 1965 Ford Mustang having a 4.7 L, 289 cubic inch, V8
      engine was also retrofitted in accordance with the present
      disclosure. The engine included an Edelbrock Performance
      carburetor having a manual choke. Prior to modifying the engine
      with the principles of the present disclosure, an average gas
      mileage of 14 mpg was observed for this car.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] In accordance with some of the aforementioned embodiments,
      the engine of this car was modified in the following manner.
      First, a fuel line from the fill neck of the car's gasoline tank
      was connected to the driver's side of the carburetor. Flow through
      this fill line was controlled by a [1/8] inch needle valve.
      Second, energies were delivered from the alternator of the truck's
      engine to the oil circulating within the truck's engine block. A
      Lutron switch was utilized to control the flow of energies to the
      engine's oil. The energies were delivered to the engine's oil via
      a probe connected to a wire made of 316 stainless steel. This wire
      was insulated by electrical tape wrapped about the wire. In this
      modification, the oil probe was installed in the external oil
      cooler. Third, the engine's thermostat was provided with two
      additional [1/8] inch coolant passageways, as discussed above.
      Fourth, the pressure of the fuel being supplied to the engine's
      carburetor was reduced to approximately 0.5 PSI.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] During road testing, improved fuel mileage of approximately
      22 mpg was observed during drives of approximately 100 miles.
      Further, improved torque and acceleration by the truck's engine
      were noted by operators. Moreover, a reduction in exhaust noise
      was also observed. In addition, a magnetic field was detected in
      oil samples removed from the car's engine. In particular, a
      military grade compass was disposed approximately 8 inches away
      from the oil samples, and the north designated needle of the
      compass pointed to the oil container, regardless of the location
      of the compass.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0132] A 1995 Ford F150, 4-wheel-drive, pickup truck having over
      150,000 driven miles was also modified in accordance with the
      principles of the present disclosure. This truck included a 351
      cubic inch engine with electronic fuel injection. Prior to
      modification of the truck's engine, this truck was achieving
      approximately 8-10 mpg.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] In accordance with the embodiments described herein, this
      truck's engine was modified in the following manner. First, a
      vapor recovery line was installed from the gas tank to the
      passenger side of an Edelbrock Performance carburetor having a
      manual choke. Flow through this line was controlled with a [1/8]
      inch needle valve. Second, a rheostat was installed to limit the
      current provided to the coil of the ignition system. Third, the
      choke and throttle plates of the carburetor were adjusted to
      control the flow of air into the carburetor. Fourth, energies were
      delivered from the alternator of the truck's engine to the oil
      circulating within the truck's engine block. Fifth, the engine's
      thermostat was provided with two additional [1/8] inch coolant
      passageways.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] During testing, the truck was fueled with gasoline having
      an octane rating of 87 and improved gas mileage was observed. In
      particular, it was observed that the truck was achieving
      approximately 20-22 mpg during a particular test drive of
      approximately 1000 miles. During a second test drive of
      approximately 1000 miles, the truck was loaded with approximately
      8600 lbs of payload. During this test, an improved gas mileage of
      approximately 16 mpg was observed. In both tests, the truck was
      driven at approximately 70-75 mph. During these tests, improved
      power production by the truck's engine was noted by operators.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0135] A 1973 Case 580CK excavator having a rating of 55 hp was
      also retrofitted in accordance with the principles of the present
      disclosure. The excavator included a gravity-fed fuel system and a
      Zenith carburetor having a manual choke. The excavator was running
      on gasoline having a fuel rating of 87 octane. Prior to
      modification, it was noted that between 1.25 to 1.75 US gallons of
      fuel were being consumed when operating the excavator at [1/2] to
      full capacity per hour. In general, the excavator's capacity is
      approximately one (1) cubic yard of material in the front bucket.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] In accordance with the embodiments described herein, this
      excavator was modified in the following manner. First, energies
      were delivered from the alternator of the truck's engine to the
      oil circulating within the truck's engine block. In particular, a
      12 gauge copper THNN wire was used to transfer energies from the
      engine's alternator to the oil circulating within the engine. The
      flow of energy through the copper wire was regulated by a Lutron
      switch, as discussed above. Further, the energies were delivered
      to the engine's oil via a 316 stainless steel probe between the
      engine's oil sending unit and engine block. Next, a total of six
      (6) periodic adjustments were made to the engine's fuel and air
      supplies, with each adjustment further reducing the supplies of
      air and fuel. The observations made during each of the six (6)
      periodic adjustments are discussed below in greater detail. For
      each adjustment, however, it was noted that the temperature of the
      exhaust at the manifold was approximately 350[deg.] F. to
      450[deg.] F. Within 28 inches of the exhaust manifold, the
      temperature of the exhaust had cooled to approximately 80[deg.] F.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] During operation, and after the first adjustment, it was
      observed that the excavator consumed 1.25 gallons of fuel to move
      a given load for one (1) hr. After the second adjustment, the
      excavator consumed 1.10 gallons to move a similar load for the
      same amount of time. After the third adjustment, the excavator
      consumed 1.0 gallon to move a similar load for the same amount of
      time. After the fourth adjustment, the excavator consumed 0.74
      gallons to move a similar load for the same amount of time. After
      the fifth adjustment, the excavator consumed 0.5 gallons to move a
      similar load for the same amount of time. After the sixth
      adjustment, the excavator consumed 0.35 gallons to move a similar
      load for the same amount of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to
      those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification
      and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended
      that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary
