        <p><b><i>Invention could solve resistant disease dilemma; MRSA
              to dust mites tremble</i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ed Neister's been working to clean up people and the
        environment for over 30 years. </p>
      <p>Five startup companies and numerous inventions later, the New
        Durham resident's newest venture arguably has the most potential
        yet for business success. More importantly, it could help health
        care professionals tackle the increasing scourge of
        drug-resistant infections, saving billions of dollars and
        countless lives. </p>
      <p>Tucked away for the last few years in his backyard workshop off
        Brackett Road, Neister has developed the technology to kill
        Noroviruses, C. diff, MRSA and other problem viruses and
        bacteria using a section of the ultraviolet light, or UV,
        spectrum to bombard them with killing high-energy photons. </p>
      <p>With the help of his brother John, he is ready to begin
        producing mobile disinfection units that will be marketed under
        the Sterilray name. </p>
      <p>Several of the units have been sold and are being tested in
        this country and abroad. </p>
      <p>The Neisters say their own research shows Sterilray is
        astoundingly effective, up to 10,000 times more deadly than
        chemical cleaners. But they are waiting for results from
        government and private industry now trying out the new units,
        and for word to spread that Sterilray performs as advertised. </p>
      <p>Then the market for their hand-held disinfection wands could be
        worldwide — and huge. </p>
      <p>"In the medical area, everybody wants to see results first,"
        said Ed Neister, who formed Healthy Environment Innovations LLC
        four years ago to produce Sterilray. He first called it
        GermBuster but since has changed the name. </p>
      <p>The physicist left his fifth startup, Powerspan, to devote
        himself to finding a solution to so-called "superbugs" using
        light waves. </p>
      <p>Powerspan develops environmental control technology for
        electric power plants and is headquartered just down the road
        from Neister's home and workshop. Before that, his other
        ventures have included a laser device that removes tattoos. </p>
      <p>Light has been a specialty of his since his doctoral studies at
        Brandeis University, and he did research with lasers at AVCO and
        later Honeywell. </p>
      <p><b>The problem</b> </p>
      <p>The problem Sterilray targets has been quietly growing in
        hospitals worldwide as overuse of antibiotics has created
        strains of resistant microorganisms that cause everything from
        annoying intestinal distress in the case of the Norwalk virus to
        staph infections that can kill weakened patients. </p>
      <p>Several years ago, health officials began to see infections
        occurring outside hospitals. There is new awareness that
        adequate cleaning is needed not just in hospitals but also
        hotels, workplaces and public gathering places such as cruise
        ships. </p>
      <p>In recent testimony before the congressional House Committee on
        Government Oversight and Reform, Dr. Betsy McCaughey, chairman
        of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths, urged the
        government to do more to halt the spread of hospital infections.
      </p>
      <p>She said in 1993, there were fewer than 2,000 reported MRSA
        infections in U.S. hospitals. By 2007, 880,000 cases or 2.4
        percent of all patients, were infected. MRSA stands for
        methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a staph superbug. </p>
      <p>McCaughey said MRSA and other resistant bacteria increasingly
        are present in hospitals and the government is not adequately
        monitoring infection rates. </p>
      <p>"As long as hospitals are inadequately cleaned, doctors' and
        nurses' hands will become recontaminated seconds after they wash
        and glove, as soon as they touch a keyboard, or a privacy
        curtain or a bedrail. How dirty are hospitals? A recent survey
        of 49 operating rooms in four New England hospitals found that
        over half the surfaces in the operating room that were supposed
        to be disinfected by hospital cleaners were left uncleaned,"
        said McCaughey. <br>
        Even with awareness, thoroughly cleaning an infected surface is
        difficult. </p>
      <p>The most common method has been to use a solution of various
        disinfecting chemicals and water, often a 10 percent bleach
        solution. </p>
      <p>In other applications, such as sewer plants, ultraviolet light
        has been used for years to incapacitate germs by exposing water
        to UV rays in what is known as the "germicidal" spectrum. This
        works by interfering with the germ's DNA so it cannot reproduce.
        This can come undone, however. </p>
      <p>Neister became interested in light as a disinfectant after news
        of a persistent problem with the Norwalk virus on cruise ships.
        After research in conjunction the University of New Hampshire,
        he found that by directing photons from the "far" UV spectrum he
        not only inactivated the germs' DNA but actually broke it up,
        killing them. </p>
      <p>Excited by his findings, Neister began working on manufacturing
        a small device that could generate far UV in a mobile
        disinfecting unit. He has applied for and has had 22 patents
        accepted related to the Sterilray light wand. </p>
      <p>Once he had a viable device, Neister sought out a laboratory to
        do further testing on a range of problem germs. </p>
      <p>Jim Barbato, president, of Microbiology Research Associates, in
        Acton, Mass., said his lab put various problem microorganisms in
        petri dishes and briefly exposed them to Neister's device. The
        results were very promising. </p>
      <p>"As microbiologists we don't get too excited about things, and
        it was rather astounding to see how it killed microorganisms so
        quickly. We got excited about this," said Barbato. "They were
        able to kill almost 100 percent." </p>
      <p>Infectious microorganisms now are dealt with using chemicals,
        heat or radiation. These have to be handled properly and can be
        toxic, said Barbato. He said Neister's device has an advantage
        in that it's dry and fast. It also avoids the resistance cycle
        that has created superbugs. </p>
      <p>"It's almost equivalent to hitting them with a bomb. They're
        not going to develop a resistance," said Barbato. </p>
      <p><b>Small and light</b> </p>
      <p>Once Neister knew he'd found the right UV frequency, he focused
        on designing a functional device that could be carried from room
        to room and easily used by a cleaning worker. </p>
      <p>The first prototype of his light wand weighed 11 pounds.
        Neister since has reduced it to 4 pounds. </p>
      <p>It looks like a clothes iron with a thin light bulb tucked into
        its hot iron end. </p>
      <p>The wand emits a purplish light that is shined 2 to 6 inches
        above a surface to disinfect it. Results take less than a
        second. Its power comes from the larger power pack the wand is
        stored in. </p>
      <p>So far, Neister plans to produce two styles of the Sterilray. </p>
      <p>One power pack is the size of a heart monitor machine and can
        be wheeled around a facility. Another is the size of a vacuum
        and can be strapped on like a backpack. <br>
        Each style has its accompanying hand-held wand. </p>
      <p>They will not be cheap, costing roughly $26,000 each. But the
        cost should come down as more units are produced. </p>
      <p>Younger brother John, 58, is retired from publishing sales, and
        has joined Ed in the venture as executive vice president. He
        comes up from his home in Lincoln, Mass., several days a week to
        help market Sterilray. </p>
      <p>One unit is being tried by a Veterans Affairs hospital in
        California, and several more have been sold to a sales
        representative in England. </p>
      <p>John leaves soon for Mexico to deliver another Sterilray to a
        potential distributor. Once results start coming in from these
        first units, he believes sales will follow. Here in the U.S.,
        there has been more interest among food establishments than from
        hospitals, which frustrates John. </p>
      <p>"They seem to feel that infection in hospitals is inevitable,
        and we think it is preventable," he said. "The surfaces are
        dirty and people are getting sick." </p>
      <p>Wound cleaning is another potential application for the device.
        The Neisters have other plans to market Sterilray for cleaning
        homes and offices and are working on a version that will treat
        air ducts. They are looking for distributors and may consider
        franchising. </p>
      <p>Ed believes his far UV frequency also will kill dust mites and
        allergens. Soon he plans to begin offering a home disinfection
        service for $100. Information about this will be available at
        www.sterilray.com. </p>
      <p>After years out of the limelight in his workshop, Ed is ready
        to launch his latest business. With enormous potential rewards.
      </p>
      <p>"We've been flying under the radar on this," said Ed. "It's got
        a great potential. If it gets huge it can keep me busy for a
        while." </p>

      <p>Brandishing WPI’s legacy of innovation and entrepreneurial
        spirit, Edward Neister ’65 and Timothy McGreal ’04 (MS) have
        proven that with determination, passion, and hard work you can
        see a great idea to fruition. Both have formed their own
        companies and invented products that could ultimately save
        lives. On the other end of the invention spectrum is Michael
        Feely&nbsp; '93, who is responsible for reviewing many of the
        400,000 patent applications filed each year in the United
        States. </p>
      <p>Ed Neister’s invention looks like a prop from the 1984 movie
        Ghost Busters. But instead of trapping pesky ghosts, Neister’s
        gadget zaps something real and much more threatening— germs. </p>
      <p>His GermBuster Sanitation Wand, which uses Sterilray, a new
        type of ultraviolet lamp developed by Neister, could
        revolutionize the way people disinfect surfaces. By killing
        stubborn bacteria and viruses instantly, it could prove
        invaluable to health care facilities, food processing centers,
        germ testing laboratories, and hospitality centers, including
        cruise ships. </p>
      <p>Consider this: A typical surface can have a million CFUs
        (coliform units) of bacteria per square centimeter, but a
        typical surface cleaner kills only a small percentage of those
        bacteria. It can take as little as 10 viral units of a norovirus
        to make a person sick. “What we’re saying is, there’s no better
        way to disinfect a surface than to use this far UV light,”
        Neister explains. </p>
      <p>After graduating from WPI in 1965 with a BS in physics, Neister
        went on to become one of the earliest developers of products
        using laser technology. He has started six companies, including
        his current enterprise, Healthy Environment Innovations, in New
        Durham, N.H., and has invented several products, including a
        tattoo removal laser. His latest idea has turned into the
        GermBuster. </p>
      <p>Neister chose to attend WPI because he “wanted a school where a
        student was not just a theorist but an experimentalist.” It was
        important for him to be able to grasp “the physics of nature,
        not just the calculations.” </p>
      <p>When he began his doctoral studies at Brandeis, the potential
        of laser technology (still in its infancy) was too tempting for
        Neister’s entrepreneurial side. “It wasn’t long before I
        realized I didn’t want to be a nuclear physicist,” he admits. “I
        said, ‘It’s new technology and I’m there.’ I took a leave of
        absence [from Brandeis] and never went back.” </p>
      <p>He eventually earned his MS in physics from Northeastern
        University, while continuing to work at AVCO and later at
        Honeywell in laser research. Yet, as exciting as the research
        was, Neister became disillusioned with the field’s lack of job
        security. “In 1970 I said, ‘Enough!’ and started my own
        company.” </p>
      <p>Several years (and companies) later, Neister began exploring
        wastewater treatment using UV rays and looking for ways to apply
        the same process to kill surface bacteria. </p>
      <p>Used commonly in the treatment of wastewater, rays in the UVC,
        or “germicidal” band, cause base pairs in the DNA molecule to
        bond tightly, rendering the molecule unable to replicate and
        microorganisms unable to reproduce. But under certain
        circumstances, light with longer wavelengths can weaken the base
        pair bonds, enabling the organisms to start reproducing again.
        Neister discovered that light in the far UV spectrum, with a
        much stronger photon energy than light from standard UV lamps,
        killed significantly more pathogens and actually damaged other
        parts of the DNA molecule. It virtually destroys all types of
        pathogens in less than one second. Hence, the birth of
        Sterilray. </p>
      <p>“We made a simple lamp at different wavelengths, tested it at
        the University of New Hampshire, and saw improvement [in the
        destruction of a phage virus],” says Neister. At that point, he
        knew he had a “significant method for killing viruses on a
        surface.” </p>
      <p>Though it has taken almost five years to develop fully, there’s
        still more testing to be done. Neister is looking at the
        possibility of doing bacterial and virus testing at WPI’s new
        Life Sciences and Bioengineering Center at Gateway Park, part of
        an 11-acre life sciences and bioengineering district the
        university is developing with the city of Worcester. He says
        that a partnership with WPI is likely sometime within the next
        year. </p>
      <p>Neister is excited at the prospect of working with WPI again.
        After all, he notes, it was a great foundation for his career as
        scientist, inventor, and entrepreneur. “The most important thing
        is WPI’s ability to teach students to think for themselves,” he
        says. “Doing all those experiments gave you a sense that you
        have a bunch of doors that you must figure out how to open. You
        won’t get that out of books. You have to think your way through
        problems.” </p>

      </center>
      <p>Healthy Environment Innovations has filed patents for an
        exciting, innovative approach to destroying life-threatening
        organisms on all types of surfaces and in the air. Sterilray™
        Technology is 10,000 times more effective in killing pathogens
        like MRSA, Acinetobacter, C-diff, and the norovirus than any
        other disinfecting or sterilizing method. It is capable of
        destroying many of the pathogenic bacteria and viruses in less
        than one second. Other methods and chemical cleaners require
        contact times of 30 seconds to 5 minutes to be effective. </p>
      <p>The Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand (formally known as the
        GermBuster Sanitation Wand) does this by targeting two critical
        bonds that make up the proteins in the DNA structure. Recent
        electron micrographs show for the first time rupture of the cell
        wall and segmentation of a Bacillus Atrophaeus spore (first on
        the list of hardest to kill) after irradiation. Thus Sterilray™
        is much more effective than any other method for destroying
        bacteria, viruses, spores, and cists, as well as toxic
        substances that have similar bond energies. This new technology
        will radically change the manner in which the spread of
        contagious agents are contained, controlled, and eliminated in
        confined populations. It reduces treatment time, as well as
        cost, and improves the quality of the disinfection and
        sterilization process. For the first time, the ability to
        isolate the source of contamination and prevent its spread will
        be available 24/7. </p>
      <p>The Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand will revolutionize the way
        people disinfect surfaces. This site will be continually updated
        as our product line, applications and test results of Sterilray™
        Technology expand, so please visit us often. Please send us an
        email or call if you would like more information. We, at HEI,
        welcome your interest and would be pleased to help you control
        pathogens in your workplace where people gather and are

      </center>
      <p><b>Inactivation vs Kill</b> </p>
      <p>Before the development of Sterilray™, all UVC lamps produce a
        specific wavelength of 253.7 nanometers (commonly called 254nm).
        The UVC band contains wavelengths called “Germicidal” because
        they alter or flip a microorganism’s DNA so that it can no
        longer reproduce. The photon energy penetrates the outer
        structure of the cell and alters the DNA molecule to form
        dimers. This process of DNA modification is called deactivation.
        However, under certain conditions, dimers produced by 254
        wavelengths can flip back and the pathogens can start to
        replicate. </p>
      <p>Sterilray produces a wavelength in the FUV band with much more
        photon energy. This additional energy breaks either the protein
        peptide bonds or the disulfide bonds of the DNA totally killing
        the microorganism. </p>
      <p><b>Action Time</b> </p>
      <p>254nm output of photon energy is measured in microwatt seconds.
        New 254nm lamps will produce UV energy in the range of 500
        microwatts per square centimeter. A 254nm lamp close to a
        surface would need more than 100 seconds to “deactivate”
        pathogens. This output will slowly deteriorate over a one year
        period and is affected by the number of start cycles. </p>
      <p>Sterilray’s photon effectiveness is nearly 10,000 times
        greater. This increase in effectiveness translates to faster
        action times making it possible to kill pathogens in less than
        one second! The Sterilray™ lamp remains efficient for more than
        one year. </p>
      <p><b>Performance</b> </p>
      <p>Moving air, especially below 77°F (25°C) has an adverse effect
        on the 254nm light tubes performance. To compensate, additional
        lamps are installed and change out cycles are accelerated. The
        output and stability of standard UVC lamps are drastically
        reduced in the presence of cold and/or moving air. </p>
      <p>Sterilray’s does not use cathodes and is therefore not affected
        by temperature or humidity. Sterilray™ is RF excited so it can
        be turned instantly on and off hundreds of times without
        affecting the lamp life. </p>
      <p><b>Power</b> </p>
      <p>Even the so called high-output ultraviolet germicidal devices
        produce relatively low amounts of photon energy. Standard 254nm
        lamps only have one power setting and can not be changed. </p>
      <p>Sterilray’s ability to change power is a major benefit. The
        Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand has three power settings: </p>
      <p><i>Smooth</i> —&nbsp; for sanitizing smooth hard surfaces or
        low level disinfection. </p>
      <p><i>Textured</i> —&nbsp; for sanitizing textured surfaces such
        as bedspreads or where a higher level of disinfection is
        required. </p>
      <p><i>Deodorize</i> — will produce a low level of activated oxygen
        directly to the surface to deodorize that specific area and
        produce the highest level of disinfection when required. </p>
      <p>Sterilray’s high power is primarily used for oxidation of
        surfaces. This is the power setting of the lamp that will
        destroy chemicals and odors such as cigarette smoke, VOC’s,
        diesel fumes and formaldehyde. activated oxygen (O3) is a
        colorless gas with a distinct, pungent odor. It is a molecule
        made up of 3 atoms of oxygen. It is three thousand times more
        potent than chlorine in destroying bacteria and viruses. </p>
      <p><b>Benefits of Activated Oxygen</b> </p>
      <p>Once generated, activated oxygen is quite unstable, one of the
        three oxygen atoms eagerly splits off the molecule and attaches
        itself to any particle or pollutant with which it comes in
        contact. That single oxygen atom from the activated oxygen air
        purifier proceeds to “oxidize” that particle. As a result, the
        particle will no longer be toxic, and will no longer be able to
        reproduce, if it is biological. When the single oxygen (O1)
        molecule oxidizes the particle, it too is destroyed. The Food
        and Drug Administration (FDA) requires activated oxygen output
        of indoor medical devices to be no more than 0.05 ppm (parts per
        million). Sterilray™ applies activated oxygen directly to the
        surface—only the area directly below the Disinfection Wand has
        any measurable activated oxygen. This dissipates within seconds
        so no residual activated oxygen remains present in the room or
        treated area and is always well below the .05 ppm requirement. </p>
