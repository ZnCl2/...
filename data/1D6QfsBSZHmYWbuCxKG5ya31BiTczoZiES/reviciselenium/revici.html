      <br>
      Emanuel Revici, MD transformed medicine in the 1930's during the
      laboratory and clinical research he conducted in Paris. By
      observing the quantum or energetic properties of lipids in health
      and disease, Dr. Revici discovered non-toxic lipids that treat
      pain and cancer. Thereafter he pursued his research at the
      Institute of Applied Biology in Mexico and NYC until his death in
      1998 at 101.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici was always 50-100 years ahead of his time. While
      physicians and scientists have confirmed some of his discoveries
      in the last sixty years, many remain unrecognized. Once tapped
      however they stand to transform medicine in the 21st century.<br>

      <b>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This is the story of Emanuel Revici M.D., his groundbreaking
      medical discoveries and his success in treating pain, cancer and
      other illnesses with his non-toxic "chemotherapy". It is a true
      story of a physician whose work was published by the prestigious
      Pasteur Institute, yet who was subsequently persecuted and
      prosecuted by the medical establishment. Kelley Eidem captures a
      genuine feeling of this extraordinary physician often told through
      the experiences of Dr. Revici's patients. This story will melt
      your heart.<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;Dr. Emanuel Revici has developed an original approach to the
      treatment of cancer. His nontoxic chemotherapy uses lipids,
      lipid-based substances, and essential elements to correct an
      underlying imbalance in the patient's chemistry. Lipids-organic
      compounds such as fatty acids and sterols-are important
      constituents of all living cells. They are a separate, critical
      system in the body's defenses against illness, according to
      research conducted by Dr. Revici early in his career.<br>
      <br>
      The Romanian-born physician, who practices in New York City, has
      applied his wide-ranging discoveries for over sixty years to the
      treatment of cancer as well as many other disorders, including
      AIDS, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, drug
      addiction, schizophrenia, allergies, shock, and burns. The great
      majority of his cancer patients are in advanced stages of the
      illness. Five, ten, sometimes twenty years after receiving
      treatment, some of these patients are in remission with no signs
      of active disease.<br>
      <br>
      Revici, in his mid-nineties, is fiercely dedicated, still makes
      occasional house calls, and has patients call him at home. To
      critics, his approach is far too complex, too theoretical, and
      inconsistent in its results. Even friendly critics within the
      alternative health field say he cures very few cancer patients.
      But to admirers, he is a man who has saved the lives of cancer
      patients pronounced hopeless by orthodox doctors, a scientific
      genius who has opened up whole new vistas and whose theories and
      discoveries may serve as a principal basis for future medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on Revici's 1961 book, Research in Physiopathology as a
      Basis of Guided Chemotherapy With Special Applications to Cancer,
      Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer a leading authority on selenium, wrote, "I
      came to the conclusion that Dr. Revici is an innovative medical
      genius, outstanding chemist and a highly creative thinker. I also
      realized that few of his medical colleagues would be able to
      follow his train of thought and thus would be all too willing to
      dismiss his work."1<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici views health as a dynamic balance between two opposing
      kinds of activity that occur in all living systems. One process,
      the anabolic, or constructive, fosters the growth and build-up of
      natural patterns. The other process is catabolic, or destructive,
      involving the breakdown of structure, the liberation of energy,
      and the utilization of stored resources. According to Dr. Revici,
      a long-term predominance of either activity leads to abnormality
      and disease.<br>
      <br>
      In his "guided 1ipid" therapy with cancer patients, Revici has
      found two basic patterns of 1ipid imbalance-one, the result of an
      excess of sterols, and the other, the result of an excess of fatty
      acids. Sterols are solid unsaturated alcohols such as cholesterol.
      In treating cancer, Revici first determines whether the anabolic
      or catabolic phase of activity is currently progressing unchecked.
      Then he administers lipidbased compounds to renormalize the
      balance between the body's opposing forces.<br>
      <br>
      Revici describes the body's overall defense system as consisting
      of four successive phases. When an antigen, or foreign substance,
      such as a virus or microbe, enters an organism, it activates the
      defense system. In the first phase, the antigen is broken down by
      enzymes. This is followed by the lipidic phase, followed in turn
      by the coagulant antibody phase, and succeeded finally by a phase
      mediated by globulinic antibodies able to fully neutralize the
      antigen. <br>
      <br>
      he key point about this defense system is that a new phase does
      not start until the previous phase has been successfully
      completed. At any point where the agents available are
      qualitatively insufficient to defend against the noxious
      influence, the sequence breaks down. Then the body overcompensates
      by manufacturing excessive amounts of the defense agents from the
      breakdown point, and it does not progress to the next phase.
      Revici found that most chronic diseases, including cancer, are
      characterized by such abnormal conditions. When the body's defense
      is arrested in the lipidic phase, either fatty acids or sterols
      are produced in abnormally large quantities, leading to a variety
      of disorders, including cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Patients diagnosed with an excess of sterols are treated with
      fatty acids to correct the imbalance. Conversely, patients found
      to have a predominance of fatty acids are treated with sterols and
      other agents.<br>
      <br>
      This "biologically guided chemotherapy," as Dr. Revici calls it,
      is highly individualized to suit each person's specific metabolic
      character and condition. "There are simply no two cancers which
      are alike, just as no two individuals are alike," he has said.2
      The substances and dosages used are unique for each patient and
      can be changed if analytical tests reveal a change in the body's
      balance. Through regular tests, such as the urine pH, specific
      gravity, surface tension, and chloride index, Dr. Revici can
      detect systemic changes in the body produced by lipid imbalances.<br>
      <br>
      Revici's research has demonstrated that lipids have an affinity
      for tumors and other abnormal tissues. Because of this, the lipids
      or lipid-like synthetic compounds administered to the patient,
      either by mouth or injection, travel directly to the tumor or
      lesion. Cancerous tissue is abnormally rich in free lipids, and
      the lipidic agents introduced into the bloodstream are readily
      taken up by the tumor.<br>
      <br>
      Revici's nontoxic cancer therapy has been denied both fair testing
      and funding in the United States, though it has been studied and
      put into practice in France, Italy, and Austria. A distinguished
      physician and research scientist who graduated first in his class
      at the University of Bucharest, Dr. Revici has been
      stereotypically portrayed by the American media as a quack who
      should have been put out of business a long time ago. The American
      Cancer Society put Revici's therapy on its Unproven Methods
      blacklist in 1961, and in 1984, the State of New York tried to
      revoke his medical license permanently on grounds of deviation
      from standard medicine, negligence, incompetence, fraud, the use
      of unapproved experimental drugs, and similar charges. After four
      years of struggle, Revici triumphed in duly 1988 with a decision
      that placed him on probation but allows him to continue treating
      cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      To save his license, Revici's patients and several medical
      civil-liberties groups undertook intensive lobbying at the state
      capitol. At the federal level, New York Congressman Guy Molinari
      held an all-day hearing in March 1988 to address the Revici matter
      and the whole field of alternative cancer therapies. Dr. Seymour
      Brenner, a respected radiation oncologist in private practice in
      New York, testified on Revici's behalf He had investigated a
      number of patients in very advanced stages of cancer, incurable by
      orthodox means, whom Revici had put into long remissions. Dr.
      Brenner had an independent panel of pathologists confirm the
      diagnosis and stage of illness prior to each patient's initial
      visit to Revici. He testified that his personal findings strongly
      suggest Revici has a cancer treatment deserving further study, and
      he proposed that such an evaluation be conducted by the FDA.<br>
      <br>
      …In a letter to Congressman Molinari, Brenner outlined a protocol
      in which a panel of doctors would monitor cancer patients placed
      on alternative therapies after their conditions had been deemed
      unamenable to the standard forms of treatment. The letter
      contained the detailed case histories of ten advanced cancer
      patients whom Revici had healed.<br>
      <br>
      One patient, a forty-three-year-old man, was diagnosed with an
      invasive, high-grade cancer of the bladder at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in September 1980. "They said, 'The
      only way you can be treated is if we take your bladder out and
      give you a colostomy on the side.' He said no.", The patient
      visited Dr. Revici in October and went on the therapy. He has had
      no other treatment. In 1987, he returned to Sloan-Kettering for a
      cystoscopy, which revealed him to be cancer-free.<br>
      <br>
      Another patient, a twenty-nine-year-old woman, was operated on at
      Memorial Sloan-Kettering in October 1983 for a chordoma, a brain
      tumor. The tumor was incompletely resected, and the patient was
      given a course of radiation therapy. The young woman's condition
      progressively worsened during the twelve months following surgery.
      She was seen by Dr. Revici in May 1984, at which time she was
      confined to a wheelchair, with limited function. Since she started
      the Revici program, she has had two babies and functions well. Her
      only problem is that she walks with a cane.<br>
      <br>
      Marianne Dimetres achieved remission from preterminal uterine
      cancer through a combination of Revici's nontoxic medications,
      wheatgrass therapy, diet, and psychological support. See her story
      on page 157.<br>
      <br>
      Revici, who holds patents for his numerous chemical compounds,
      claims to have devised a novel technique to open double bonds in
      molecules of unsaturated fatty acids in order to incorporate
      different metallic elements at precise points in the molecules.
      The result is an entirely new series of therapeutic compounds,
      exceedingly low in toxicity and incorporating selenium, copper,
      sulfur, zinc, calcium, nickel, beryllium, mercury, lead, and other
      elements. In general, these compounds reportedly have a toxicity
      less than one-thousandth of that of the elements in the forms
      normally available. The technique converts toxic substances into
      safe anticancer agents. "Through this method, Revici has opened up
      an entirely new field for the therapeutic use of these elements,"
      according to Dr. Dwight McKee, one of Revici's medical
      associates.4<br>
      <br>
      Revici's use of selenium in the treatment of cancer predates
      mainstream interest in this mineral by more than twenty years.
      Selenium is one of the major trace elements always found deficient
      in cancer-prone populations. Research has shown that it is of
      value not only in preventing cancer but also in treating it.
      Revici uses a special molecular form of selenium
      (bivalent-negative selenium) incorporated in a molecule of fatty
      acid. In this form, he can administer up to 1 gram of selenium per
      day, which corresponds to 1 million micrograms per day, reportedly
      with no toxic side effects. In contrast, too much selenite
      (hexavalent-positive selenium) has toxic effects on animals, so
      human intake of commercial selenite is limited to a dosage of only
      100 to 150 micrograms by mouth. Dr. Revici often administers his
      nontoxic form of selenium by injection, usually considered to be
      four times more powerful than the form given orally.<br>
      <br>
      Extra selenium in the diet drastically reduces the spontaneous
      occurrence of cancer in mice. In human populations, high selenium
      intake correlates with low cancer rates. In a 140-~patient study
      of cancer victims treated with selenium, Dr. R. Donaldson of the
      St. Louis Veterans' Administration Hospital reported in 1983 that
      some patients deemed terminal with only weeks to live were
      completely free of all signs of cancer after four years; all the
      patients showed a reduction in tumor size and in pain.5<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici uses the Periodic Table of Elements as one of several
      guides when choosing the best course of treatment for a patient.
      This ties in with his view that cancer is part of a hierarchical
      organization found throughout Nature, from the precellular level
      to the entire organism. All the known elements, in his view, can
      be classified as supporting either anabolic or catabolic activity,
      and each element's biological activity correlates with its
      position in the Periodic Table. Revici maintains that the vertical
      rows in the table all share either anabolic or catabolic activity,
      whereas the horizontal rows indicate at which level of biological
      organization a particular element acts-whether at the level of a
      subnuclear particle (nucleoprotein), nucleus, cell, tissue, organ,
      or whole body. By this means, Dr. Revici determines the body level
      (or levels) most affected by the illness and therefore most in
      need of therapeutic intervention. This information is correlated
      with diagnostic tests indicating which imbalance is present at
      which level.<br>
      <br>
      Harassed for decades by the American medical monopoly, Revici,
      ironically, had originally come to the United States seeking
      freedom to do his work. A scientific prodigy, he had written his
      first research manuscript at the age of twelve and entered the
      University of Bucharest at seventeen. In 1936, after serving as an
      assistant professor on the Faculty of Medicine, he moved with his
      family to Paris, where he spent three years investigating the
      biochemistry of cancer. When World War II erupted, the Revicis
      fled to Nice, where the doctor joined the French Resistance and
      gave medical aid to wounded Resistance fighters sought by the
      Nazis. His anti-fascist activities so endangered him and his wife
      and daughter that the leaders of the French Underground had to
      arrange for the family's passage out of Europe.6 The Revicis
      settled m Mexico, where Dr. Revici founded the first Institute of
      Applied Biology, in Mexico City.<br>
      <br>
      Eager to advance his research in the United States, Dr. Revici was
      granted three special visas through the intercession of Sumner
      Welles, a special aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.7 Revici
      moved to Chicago, then to New York, establishing the institute
      anew in Brooklyn in 1947. Today, his office is located in a
      two-story building in Manhattan, where he treats patients aided by
      a small support staff.<br>
      <br>
      By 1948, Revici had begun exploring the use of selenium in
      treating cancer and as a means for rendering radiation less
      harmful. His promising findings on radiation came to the attention
      of United States Navy scientists testing A-bombs in the Pacific.
      Twice, the scientists invited him to join them in studying
      radiation's harmful effects.<br>
      <br>
      In 1954, Revici's fund-raising organization financed the purchase
      of Beth David Hospital in Manhattan. Renamed Trafalgar Hospital,
      this general-care facility employing over 200 resident and
      visiting physicians enabled Revici, as the chief of oncology, to
      provide round-the-clock care for critically ill patients. Its
      animal research laboratories were staffed by 35 scientists and
      technicians, all involved in projects related to Revici's theories
      and therapeutic approach. Revici served as chief of Trafalgar's
      oncology department for over twenty years. The hospital dosed in
      1978 due to financial difficulties.<br>
      <br>
      Revici's treatment agents were used in Belgium with favorable
      results by Professor Joseph Maisin, president of the International
      Union Against Cancer and director of the Cancer Institute of the
      University of Louvain. Between 1965 and his death from a car
      accident in 1971, Maisin corresponded with Revici to describe how
      he treated patients with advanced metastatic cancer who had failed
      conventional therapies. Maisin used several Revici preparations,
      at times coupled with low-dose radiation. He reported that in nine
      of the twelve terminal-cancer patients on the Revici medicines,
      significant improvements occurred, including regression of tumors,
      disappearance of metastases, and cessation of hemorrhage.
      Incredibly, paralyzed patients were able to walk again. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici developed successful treatments for heroin and alcohol
      addiction. His detoxification agent for heroin addicts, called
      Perse, was almost chosen over methadone as the nation's treatment
      of choice. Perse, which incorporated selenium in a lipid base,
      physically detoxified addicts within five to eight days. At the
      request of Congress, Revici presented over 2,000 case histories of
      successful uses of this nontoxic and nonaddictive agent. The idea
      for Perse had arisen from Revici's cancer practice after he
      observed that patients previously on addictive narcotic analgesics
      exhibited no withdrawal symptoms when placed on his lipid
      analgesics.<br>
      <br>
      At a 1971 congressional subcommittee hearing that took testimony
      about Perse for a full day, Congressman Charles Rangel of New York
      said, "The results and what we witnessed with patients was so
      unbelievable that the doctor from Municipal Hospital has now gone
      back on a daily basis in order to continue with this chance to see
      the miraculous results that have taken place."<br>
      <br>
      Barron's ran a full-page feature on Revici's treatments for
      narcotic and alcohol addiction in 1972. Both Congress and the FDA
      promised Dr. Revici full support for large-scale clinical testing,
      signaling that Perse could be the most important breakthrough in
      drug treatment. Because selenium is normally toxic in high doses,
      Revici reformulated the medication to eliminate it. The new
      substance, called Bionar, worked just as well-in the same amount
      of time, with no withdrawal symptoms. (The selenium incorporated
      in Perse was a bivalent-negative form, very active and virtually
      nontoxic.)<br>
      <br>
      The stage seemed set for a major advance in the war on drugs. But
      less than one month after the congressional hearing, the FDA
      reversed its position and recommended methadone, an addictive and
      toxic drug, as the treatment of choice. Why?<br>
      <br>
      One possible answer is provided by Marcus Cohen, who helped
      coordinate the campaign to save Revici's license. He suggests,
      "Hospitalization was required for treatment with Perse, and
      because many of the patients were poor, Medicaid was asked to pick
      up the tab. As in the case of most drug addicts, they presented
      with other conditions besides addiction which needed medical
      attention.... Methadone, addicting in itself, nevertheless was
      favored by State and City officials as a means of controlling the
      mostly black and Hispanic drug population.... The drug companies
      and health care professionals that profited from exclusive use of
      methadone did not welcome competition, least of all from a
      treatment which did not cause a lifelong dependency."8<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici's nontoxic treatment for AIDS applies his findings on
      the antiviral and immune-enhancing properties of certain lipids.
      He views AIDS as a "quadruple pathological condition," consisting
      of:<br>
      <br>
      1. a primary viral infection, inducing<br>
      2. a deficiency in the body's natural lipidic defense, followed by<br>
      3. secondary opportunistic infections or specific neoplasms
      (cancers)<br>
      due to the lack of certain lipids, resulting in<br>
      4. an exaggerated imbalance, usually catabolic.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the four conditions is addressed with a specific
      therapeutic approach. Antiviral agents are given to inactivate, or
      kill, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To counteract the
      patient's nonspecific loss of defense against opportunistic
      infections, Dr. Revici administers, via injection, a group of
      phospholipids that he calls refractoriness lipids. These compounds
      appear to induce a generalized resistance (refractoriness) toward
      many different antigens. The doctor claims impressive results with
      these preparations in the clinical manifestations of AIDS and AIDS
      Related Complex (ARC). Antibiotics are also given to combat the
      secondary opportunistic infections. To redress bodily imbalances,
      the appropriate anticatabolic or antianabolic agents are used. <br>
      <br>
      Two of Revici's therapeutic compounds for cancer, amyl selenide
      and tri-thioformaldehyde (TT), tested positive in trials conducted
      in the late 1970s by the National Cancer Institute and Roswell
      Park Memorial Institute.9 Another selenium compound that Revici
      developed showed activity against four tumor systems in tests
      conducted in England. However, the dose at which antitumor
      activity was found was "fairly close to the toxic dose," and
      further studies of the compound were recommended.<br>
      <br>
      An unpublished study of the 1,047 cancer patients treated with the
      Revici regimen between 1946 and 1955 was made by Robert Ravich,
      M.D., who worked closely with Revici. Most of the patients were
      far advanced or terminal, and most had prior conventional
      treatment. Of the 1,047 cases, Ravich found that 100 had favorable
      response (objective and subjective); 11 had objective response
      only; 95 had subjective response only; 296 showed no response; and
      545 had equivocal or undetermined response (380 of this last group
      were treated for less than three months).10<br>
      <br>
      The only published clinical study of Revici's treatment for cancer
      appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA)
      in 1965. It was written by a panel of nine New York physicians
      after Revici himself requested that a scientific panel review his
      cancer-management program. After two years of observation, the
      panel concluded that the Revici therapy was "without value." The
      authors reported that 22 of the 33 patients in the study died of
      cancer or its complications while on the Revici treatment and 4
      more died after discontinuing the regimen. None of the 33 showed
      signs of objective tumor regression, according to the authors.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici wrote a detailed rebuttal in which he stated that the
      panel had ignored evidence indicating several tumor remissions,
      multiple reductions in tumor size, and relief of pain in many
      advanced patients. He noted that of the nine physicians on the
      panel, only two had actually seen the patients during the entire
      two-year study. He further commented that he had requested the
      study in the "hope that the demonstration of positive results in
      even a few of these advanced cases would excite sufficient
      interest to lead to a large-scale study of our approach.... To
      conclude from a limited study, such as this, that the method
      should be discontinued, in all cancers, is to say that since
      surgery and radiation have failed in these same terminal patients,
      these 'recognized' methods should also be discontinued, not only
      in these types of cancer but in all cancers in general." Although
      Dr. Revici submitted substantiating pathological data in his
      lengthy rebuttal,JAMA refused to publish it.<br>
      <br>
      It is now more than forty years since Revici developed his
      nontoxic chemotherapy. An open-minded, unbiased evaluation of it
      is long overdue.<br>

      The Revici Method is an unconventional therapy for the treatment
      of cancer developed by Emanuel Revici, MD. Dr. Revici believed
      that pathologic conditions were due to a chemical imbalance within
      the body that could be modified. The method is a blending of
      clinical observations, laboratory analyses, and chemotherapy.
      Basically, Dr. Revici would analyze the urine, blood, and body
      temperature and place patients in specific categories based on the
      "imbalance" that was discovered from these tests. The method was
      analyzed by a Clinical Appraisal Group consisting of a number of
      prominent physicians in the 1965. Thirty-three patients treated by
      Dr. Revici were analyzed by the group of physicians. No instance
      of objective tumor regression was observed in any of the 33 cases
      studies. In fact, 15 patients had autopsies after their deaths and
      there was no evidence of tumor alteration as a consequence of
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Revici remained embattled with the New York State health
      authorities for years and had his medical license was revoked in
      1993 at the age of 96. Although Dr. Revici has died, his method
      remains highly touted in unconventional medical therapy books and
      on the Internet. In fact, a number of therapies that closely
      resemble the Revici Method are now being touted by unconventional
      medical practitioners.<br>
      <br>
      Biologic Terrain Assessment (BTA) is a therapy that is remarkably
      similar to the Revici Method and promoted by some alternative
      medicine practitioners. It utilizes an analysis of the saliva,
      urine, and blood to isolate "imbalances". Herbal therapies are
      then prescribed to counteract these imbalances. In fact,
      practitioners of BTA claim that the herbal treatment can be
      directed to the organ containing the cancer to make it more
      effective. There is no objective evidence that BTA has any impact
      on cancer. There are no scientific studies evaluating its
      effectiveness. Some unconventional practitioners continue to claim
      effectiveness has been proven based on case reports and
      testimonials, which are not valid scientific endpoints.<br>
      <br>
      OncoLink does not recommend patients utilize the Revici Method or
      Biologic Terrain Assessment. Any patient considering an
      unconventional medical therapy should discuss this with their
      conventional medical physician. There can be important
      interactions with conventional cancer therapy or side effects of
      the therapy that you may not be aware. For more information on
      unconventional medical therapies and cancer see OncoLink's

      The controversial Emanuel Revici, M.D., made the bones grow back
      in cancer patients, and restored health to AIDS patients as well
      as drug addicts and alcoholics. His medicines lifted debilitating
      migraines in as little as 3 minutes. Revici's reward? He was
      attacked and ostracized by the best. JAMA published false reports
      about his work. The American Cancer Society blasted him time and
      again. Meanwhile, word of mouth brought new patients to see him
      for decades. The smears didn't work, so something more needed to
      be done. This is the true story of the greatest medical scientist
      who has ever lived. Find out what happened to Dr. Revici and find
      out how you can use the principles of his discoveries to reverse
      even advanced cancers and many other illnesses.<br>

          ANTINEOPLASTIC ACTIVITY</b><br>
        <b>ZA8401714</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>SPECIFICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutical compositions having antineoplastic activity The
      present invention refers to pharmaceutical composition having
      antineoplastic activity, containing as 5 active principle a
      combination of the following compounds:<br>
      <br>
      a) bivalent negative selenium in form of selenium incorporated in
      "tung oil" or of diselenide of formula R-Se-Se-R, wherein R is an
      alkyl or alkenyl group having an odd number of carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      b) an allphatic carboxylic acid, aldehyde or ketone having an odd
      number of carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is provided by pharmaceutical
      compositions containing, in addition to said 10 compounds and to
      suitable excipients, also other agents endowed with complementary
      activities, synergistic or able to decrease the side effects.<br>
      <br>
      The antitumoral and antineoplastic activity of selenium
      derivatives has been already described in the european patent
      application n. 83104923.4 of May 19,1983 (publication number
      0095663).<br>
      <br>
      From a clinical and pharmacological point of view, the compound
      obtained by reaction of elementary selenium and eleostearic acid
      (main constituent of tung oil), whose action can be enhanced by
      the contemporaneous administration of extracts of Bixa orellana
      seeds, proved to be particularly active.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been found that the contemporaneous administration of
      carboxylic acids, aldehydes or ketones having odd number of carbon
      atoms is able to decrease the side effects induced by selenium and
      allows therefore to increase the dosage.<br>
      <br>
      Also substances such as alcohols or polyalcohols, some amine
      compounds and corticosteroids which turned out to be active in
      decreasing the side effects, can be optionally present in the
      compositions according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The odd number of carbon atoms is preferably from 5 to 9. The
      aliphatic group or groups present preferably comprise alkyl
      groups. Ketones are preferred, especially those in which the keto
      group is between 25 alkyl groups each of which has an even number
      of carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, 3-heptanone, 3-pentanone, 3 or 5-nonanone, in
      combination with propyl, penty], heptyl, nonyl or undecyl
      diselenide, are used.<br>
      <br>
      The composition according to the invention can also comprise
      lipophilic vehicles, such as sesame oil or the like. The relative
      proportions of the a) and b) constituents in the pharmaceutical
      compositions according 30 to the invention may range from 1: 10 to
      1:50.<br>
      <br>
      Other substances which can be present according to the invention
      are polyalcohols or alcohols having odd number of carbon atoms,
      preferably glycerol, aminoalcohols, nicotinic acid, aminobenzoic
      acids, cortisone.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred composition comprise constituent a) (diselenide) and
      ketone b) (3-heptanone) in the weight proportions of 1:25 for the
      parenteral administration and of 1:40 forthe oral one.<br>
      <br>
      The diselenides according to the invention are prepared with known
      methods while for the preparation of the reaction product of
      elementary selenium and eleostearic acid or tung oil, reference is
      made to the previously cited european patent application.<br>
      <br>
      As far as the compositions of the invention are concerned, the
      following, non limiting examples are reported.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1 </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vials for intramuscular injection Dipentyl diselenide 3-Heptanone
      Sesame oil 2% 50% 48% The above composition is distributed into 1
      mi vials to be administered by intramuscular route.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2 </b><br>
      <br>
      Gelatine capsules or drop for oral route Dipentyl diselenide 55
      3-Heptanone Sesame oil 2% 80% 18% 0,5-2 MI of the above
      composition are dosed in gelatine capsules. Alternatively, the
      same composition can be directiv administered as drops.<br>
      <br>
      The acute and subacute toxicity of the composition of the Example
      1 have been determined by the 60 subcutaneous and intraperitoneal
      route in mice, rats and dogs.<br>
      <br>
      2 GB 2 135 885 A 2 Acute toxicity The LD50 of the composition of
      the Example 1, after administration both by subcutaneous and
      intraperitoneal route, in FC, mice (28-32 g) and in Carworth rats
      (150-170 g) proved always to be higher than 350 mg Selkg or than
      100 milkg.<br>
      <br>
      Subacute toxicity The su bacute toxicity has been studied by
      administering the composition of the Example 1 by subcutaneous
      route to Carworth rats (150-170 g) for six weeks (5 days a week)
      at doses ranging from 10.5 to 350 mg/Se/kg or 3- 100 ml/kg. No
      death was noticed in any group during treatment.<br>
      <br>
      After the animals' sacrifice, 20 or 40 days after treatment, the
      microscoptic, hematologic and hematochemical exams did not show
      any pathological change.<br>
      <br>
      Subacute toxicity in dogs Two groups of 6 Beagle dogs were treated
      with 0.60 and 1.26 mi/kg of the composition of Example 1 five days
      a week for five weeks. No death occurred. After sacrifice at the
      end of the treatment, the pathological 15 and biochemical exams
      did not show any pathological change.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions according to the invention exert an
      antineoplastic activity similar to those of the already mentioned
      european application, such activities being sometimes enhanced
      because of the high elenium dosages attainable with the
      compositions of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention can be used in clinical medicine
      in a variety of neoplastic conditions, at 20 dosages ranging from
      5-20 g by oral route and from 0.5 to 2 mi by intramuscular route,
      2 to 4times daily.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment is based on the concept of a primary subnuclear
      anomaly and of an abnormal lipidic dualism: the number of
      eosinophils in blood, the pH, the specific gravity and the surface
      tension are the most important guide parameters for the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      (The concept of anabolic-catabolic dualism, and relative
      definitions, are widely illustrated - also from an 25 experimental
      point of view (in animal and in human field) - in E. Revici,
      Research in Physiopathology, ediz.<br>
      <br>
      Van Nostrand, Princeton 1961). Nevertheless, the validity of the
      invention should not be considered as based on the actual
      verification of the theoretical considerations discussed in said
      treatise.<br>

      Various tung oil or tung oil fatty acid compositions and use
      thereof for treating at least some symptoms of body defense
      deficiencies in patients having said symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention concerns various tung oil compositions and
      their use in methods for treating and preventing the symptoms of
      different body deficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have found that the abnormal in general results from the
      incapacity, qualitative or quantitative, of the body to resolve
      the problem resulting from the intervention of a noxious action. I
      have found that this deficiency concerns the incapacity of the
      body defense to fight successfully the occuring condition related
      to the intervention of lipids, and for certain conditions, more
      specifically of agents having in their molecules a trienic
      conjugated formation.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that the naturally very efficient defense agents
      concern fatty acids which have in their molecule three trienic
      conjugated double bonds formation, respectively three double bonds
      separated by single bonds. The parallel position of these
      conjugated trienes especially when part of a fatty acid gives the
      agent a marked efficient defense activity.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that a such fatty acid represented by the eleostearic
      acid, is naturally present in tung oil (china wood oil) obtained
      from the seeds of Aleuritis Cordata. I have found that the use of
      the tung oil itself, with esters of this acid and also with other
      fatty acids present represents an active, and in the same time, an
      especially favorable accepted form to be administered.<br>
      <br>
      The study of the pathological conditions has shown that a fatty
      acid defense deficiency is exhibited by a large number of them.
      They are specifically indicated for the administration of the tung
      oil. The following pathological conditions and their symptoms
      represent conditions with such a trienic fatty acids deficiency
      that can be treated accordingly to the invention: neoplastic
      diseases such as cancer, sarcoma, lymphoma and leukemia;
      infections, microbial, fungal and especially viral as in Ebstein -
      Barr, AIDS, the common cold, influenza and herpes; pain,
      especially acid pain; aging; arteriosclerosis; hypertension; organ
      inflammatory conditions convulsions and epilepsy; certain
      allergies; constipation; manic manifestations and schizophrenia.
      This enumeration is not limitative, any pathological condition
      with an anabolic-constructive imbalance representing a special
      indication for this treatment. In view of the nature of the
      treatment, according to the invention, the addition of other fats
      or fatty acids, especially those from polyunsaturated oils,
      enhances the activity of the tung oil.<br>
      <br>
      The association of these polyunsaturated oils or their fatty acids
      with the tung oil or its ester compounds, through a common
      activity represents a progress in their use. Safflower oil, corn
      oil, cod liver oil, sardine and salmon oils, their fatty acids or
      other unsaturated fatty acids added to the tung oil enhances its
      defense activity The eleostearic acid or its salts or esters and
      the tung oil fatty acids obtained from the tung oil through any
      procedure are other forms of returning to the body the missing
      defense lipids which cause the deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The basic nature of the intervention through an induced natural
      defense has led to the administration of the agents of this
      invention also for the general prevention of a diversity of
      conditions resulting from their deficiency. Cancer,
      arteriosclerosis and aging represent the main conditions
      considered to be prevented by the agents of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The main defect of the use of tung oil, its compounds, its fatty
      acids, or the eleostearic acid is the induction of diarrhea. The
      administration by injection reduces this problem, but does not
      prevent it, especially at higher dosages. The addition of commonly
      available antidiarrhea preparations, especially those limited to a
      local intestinal action, may permit the use of higher doses,
      especially for the administration by injection. The addition of
      the tung oil of other antianabolic compounds especially indicated
      for the condition treated, is manifestly enhancing its favorable
      action. Such compounds comprise mainly bivalent negative selenium,
      bivalent negative sulfur, 3-ketones, fatty acids, fatty aldehydes,
      with or without copper, barium and magnesium incorporated therein.
      This enumeration is not limitative.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the relationship between defense and the agents of the
      invention, good effects were seen also in conditions with opposite
      catabolic imbalance, especially when treated together with
      anticatabolic agents, especially non sterolic. The oxidation of
      the tung oil may even enhance its activity<br>
      <br>
      The toxicity studies - acute, subacute and chronic in mice, rats,
      guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits has shown an acceptance of doses
      between 500 and and 2000 times higher than those respectively
      taken by humans, which represents a fairly good condition. No
      pathological changes and no carcinogenic action were seen.<br>
      <br>
      The usual doses for the different conditions vary according to the
      condition, with usual daily doses orally and by injection, from 50
      mg of the oil to more than 500 mg. These doses are generally
      administered twice a day or more frequently, if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The administration of these formulations are in general limited by
      the appearance of diarrhea. Due to the unique mechanism of
      intervention, through the induction of the main natural defense,
      the inventions opens a new, very broad way in prevention and
      therapy.<br>

      A method for treating a host for inducing relief of pain or
      anesthesia which comprises administering hydrolyzed
      epichlorohydrin, magnesium thiosulfate, or a butanol at the site
      of the painful area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to methods and preparations for relieving
      pain or producing analgesia.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      A number of methods exist for treating pain: an example being U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,898,325. The applicant has found a new method is
      particularly effective for this purpose in compositions which are
      relatively simple to prepare and administer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has now been found that by administering various agents, such
      as hydroyzed epichlorohydrin (i.e., 1-chloro 2,3-epoxy propane),
      magnesium thiosulfate, or n-butanol directly to the painful area
      of a host will relieve the pain or produce analgesia therein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is known that the manifestation of pain is observed at the
      so-called trigger points. To successfully treat such pain, the
      administration of the compounds of the invention, preferably by
      injection, is found to control the pain in the immediate area as
      well as in the entire affected region.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the invention relates to the injection of from 1
      to 10 ml of a solution of between 0.1 and 1.5 weight percent
      hydrolyzed epichlorohydrin at the trigger point or immediate
      painful area. The epichlorohydrin can be hydrolyzed by heating it
      in water. These amounts have been found to be advantageous, but
      can be higher or lower if desired. For example, up to 50 ml of a
      0.5 weight percent solution can been used for exceptionally severe
      cases.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the pain is relieved in minutes following the
      injection. If necessary, the injections may be repeated,
      preferably 1-2 days later. If a stronger pain is present the next
      day at the site of the injection, this may be the result of an
      local inflammatory reaction. When this occurs, the pain usually
      disappears the day after, and the long term results are generally
      better.<br>
      <br>
      Another approach for relieving pain is based upon the fact that
      pain generally has either an acid or alkaline pattern. This
      character is recognized through a relationship with the urinary
      pH: the acid pain being stronger with a lower pH and being weaker
      with a higher pH. The alkaline pains is just the opposite.<br>
      <br>
      The acid pain corresponds to an anabolic imbalance with the
      predominant pathogenic action caused by steroids, while the
      alkaline pain corresponds to a catabolic action, with the
      predominant pathogenic action caused by fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      Many different agents can be used to counteract these imbalances.
      For the anabolic imbalances which are evidenced by acid pain, the
      injection of a solution of magnesium thiosulfate is utilized. The
      amount of this solution includes between about 10 and 50 ml of a
      water solution containing between about 10 and 50 weight percent
      magnesium thiosulfate.<br>
      <br>
      For alkaline pain, which indicates a catabolic imbalance, a
      solution of butanol in water is used. The amount of this solution
      ranges from 5 to 25 ml of a solution of between about 5 and 10
      weight percent butanol in water. Either n-butanol or sec-butanol
      can be used, with n-butanol preferred for best results. It is
      preferable to add to the butanol solutions about 25 to 50 percent
      by weight (based on the amount of butanol) of coramine
      (niketamide) for even better results.<br>
      <br>
      As with the hydrolyzed epichlorohydrin solution, these solutions
      are preferably administered by injection. If the type of pain
      cannot be characterized as acid or alkaline, then the
      epichlorohydrin solution should be administered. It is also
      possible to use mixtures of these solutions.<br>
      <br>
      When the nature of the disease which is causing the pain is known,
      more special agents, which can treat the disease or the symptoms
      of the disease, can be added to these solutions. Also, the number
      of injections can be repeated to enhance the pain reducing effect.<br>
      <br>
      The preparations of the invention have practically no toxicity in
      the doses used.<br>

      <br>
      A method for treating the symptoms of a neoplastic disease without
      treating the disease itself which includes administering by
      injection an effective amount of a composition which includes the
      combination of two or more ketones, aldehydes, alcohols or amines
      having certain twin formation in a vegetable oil solution to a
      patient who is suffering from the symptoms of a neoplastic disease
      to alleviate at least some of such symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the
      treatment of symptoms of neoplastic diseases without treating the
      disease itself.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      I have found the existence of a dualism in the pathological
      conditions, corresponding to an anabolic-constructive or a
      catabolic-destructive imbalance. Symptoms and analytical data
      serve to recognize the type of imbalance present. Somnolence;
      hypothermia; constipation; polyuria; slow absorption of a skin
      wheel; blood eosinophilia; low serum potassium; low red cells
      sedimentation rates; no C reactive protein and urinary high
      surface tension; high pH; chloride and calcium excretion and low
      specific gravity characterize the anabolic imbalance. The opposite
      symptoms indicate a catabolic imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      I found also the existence of a dualism in the activity of
      different agents. In general the ketones and aldehydes have an
      antianabolic action, while the positively charged alcohols and
      amines have an anticatabolic action. A method of treatment has
      resulted by using anabolic agents for the catabolic conditions and
      catabolic agents against anabolic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that the presence in a molecule of a twin formation,
      that is, of two atoms with the same positive or negative
      electrical charge bound together, confers the molecule a high
      energetic activity. This is exerted especially upon the polar
      group near the twin formation.<br>
      <br>
      I have found a special such activity for the molecules having two
      twin formations. The presence of a polar group bound to an odd
      numbered carbon of an aliphatic hydrocarbon having an odd number
      of carbons results in the presence of two twin formations. The
      same results have been found in aliphatic molecules having an even
      number of carbons with the polar group located on an even numbered
      carbon. The nature of the polar group determines the anabolic or
      catabolic character of the agent. The presence of a 3 or 5 ketone
      that is, of an oxygen atom bound to the carbons 3 or 5 of an
      aliphatic hydrocarbon having an odd number of carbons, or of a 2
      or 4 ketone, where an oxygen atom is bound to the carbons 2 or 4
      of an aliphatic hydrocarbon having an even number of carbons,
      confers to the compound a catabolic action, while a hydroxyl or
      amine group at the same position provides an anabolic character to
      the compound. The same catabolic action is found for other polar
      groups bound to the carbon atoms specified above, such as, for
      example the 3 or 5 aldehydes, and the 2 or 4 aldehydes.<br>
      <br>
      Specific compounds which have been found to be useful include
      3-pentanone; 3-heptanone; and 3 or 5 nonanone. These compounds,
      when two or more are used in combination, have provided very good
      action upon the symptoms of neoplastic disease without treating
      the diseases themselves. Propionic aldehyde in combination with a
      3 or 5 ketone has also been found to be particularly effective.
      Combinations of 2-sec-butanone; 2-hexanone; 2 or 4 octanone; with
      any of the previously mentioned compounds which provide a
      catabolic action have been found effective. These compounds have
      been found effective in general for treatment of symptoms of any
      neoplastic diseases without treating the disease itself (i.e.,
      whether such symptoms caused by either an anabolic or catabolic
      imbalance), but are even more effective for treating the symptoms
      caused solely by an anabolic imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, combinations of 3-pentanol; 3-heptanol; 3 or 5 nonanol;
      3-penthylanone; 3-heptylanone; 3 or 5 nonylanone; 3-pentylamine;
      3-heptylamine; and 3 and 5-nonylamines; 2-butanol; 2-hexanol; 2-
      or 4-octanol; 2-butylamine; 2-hexylamine; and 2 or 4 octylamine
      have a good action upon the symptoms of neoplastic diseases caused
      by a catabolic imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      Especially favorable objective and subjective changes are found in
      suffering from the symptoms of neoplastic diseases without
      treating the diseases themselves when these compounds are
      administered. This indicates the important value of the
      combination of two agents each having the two twin formations
      described previously.<br>
      <br>
      The use of two or more of these compounds, in combination,
      provides a much higher level of effectiveness for treatment of
      anabolic or catabolic symptoms of neoplastic diseases without
      treating the diseases themselves than the administration of a
      single agent. Preferred combinations are illustrated in the
      examples. The daily dosages vary according to the degree of the
      imbalance, but generally range from about 1/2 to 10 grams. No
      toxic effects have been encountered in patients which have
      received these compounds, even at the higher daily dosages.<br>
      <br>
      All the formulations to be administered were prepared in dosages
      of approximately 600 mg, with the number of dosages to be taken
      per day depending upon the specific condition to be treated. 1 ml
      of a composition containing 60% of the compounds and 40% of a
      vegetable oil provides 600 mg of the active ingredient. Similarly,
      a 70% compounds/30% vegetable oil mixture, provides 700 mg for
      each 1 ml dose. The dosages can range from 1 ml given once a day
      to 4 ml administered twice a day. Preferably, such mixtures are
      administered by injection.<br>
      <br>
      Solutions and suspensions of these agents in oils are preferred
      for administration by injection. While sesame oil, tung oil, and
      soybean oil are preferred, any vegetable oil can be used. It is
      also possible to use the oil extract from the seeds of a bixa or
      elana plant, and the term vegetable oil is used herein to include
      such extracts.<br>
      <br>
      It is necessary to use at least 10% vegetable oil in the
      formulations to avoid causing pain to the patient upon
      administration. Thus, the oil is primarily used as a carrier. It
      is important that each administered dose contain at least 600 mg
      (60%) of the compounds having the twin formation. Thus, the
      overall dosage, per day, will vary from about 0.5 to 10 grams of
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Injection at the site a tumor, or at another appropriate location
      (such as a painful area) is the preferred method of
      administration. Oral administration should be avoided because the
      liver tends to decrease the effectiveness of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      An indication of neoplastic conditions is found especially in
      anabolic constructive imbalances, characterized by urines with a
      high surface tension, high pH and low specific gravity. The
      clinical results are indicated by a marked action upon the
      different manifestations especially pain, and the presence of
      tumors.<br>
      <br>
      Predilectly the ketones and aldehydes are used to generally treat
      the symptoms of any neoplastic conditions without treating the
      conditions themselves, even independent of the nature of the
      imbalance present. As such, it represents a very important, and
      efficient new treatment for these diseases without treating the
      disease themselves.<br>
      <br>
      The scheme of the treatment is the following: Urine analyses are
      made, preferably several times a day if the condition needs
      stronger treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As basis agents, the ketones and/or aldehyde combinations are
      administered by injection. When an alkaline urine is found (i.e. a
      pH above 7), the higher dosages of these agents can be given. For
      a neutral urine (pH 6-7), the alcohol compounds are administered.
      For acid urine (pH below 6), the amine compounds are given.<br>
      <br>
      With these compositions, especially good results, both subjective
      and objective, were obtained in the treatment of symptoms of
      various neoplastic diseases without treating the diseases
      themselves. One or more of the symptoms which may be alleviated
      include pain, weakness, anemia, loss of appetite and nausea.<br>

      <br>
      The compositions of Examples 1, 2, and 5 provide a catabolic
      action and thus are preferably used to treat an anabolic
      imbalance. Such catabolic agents can also be used to generally
      treat symptoms of neoplastic diseases when the type of imbalance
      cannot be determined. Conversely, the compositions of Examples 3,
      4 and 6 provide an anabolic action, such that they are
      administered to patients exhibiting a catabolic imbalance.<br>

      <br>
      A method for making a composition containing a fatty acid or fatty
      ester compound and potassium. The compositions produced by the
      method. Administration of these compositions to a patient to
      increase the potassium content of cells or tissue having a
      potassium deficiency or to treat at least some of the symptoms of
      diseases or adverse effects caused by this potassium deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present disclosure concerns a method to treat various
      conditions resulting from potassium deficiency and preparations
      for same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is known that the abnormal cells in general and the neoplastic
      cells in particular are poor in potassium, a fact which is
      considered as including and enhancing their abnormal character. It
      is also known that the blood plasma of subjects with such abnormal
      conditions is especially rich in potassium, apparently due to the
      body's attempt to correct the cellular potassium deficiency. The
      form under which the potassium is circulating in the blood, that
      is, mainly as ceruloplasmin, however, is not the proper form from
      which the potassium can be taken by the abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises novel compositions of fatty acids, ester,
      or oils which include potassium incorporated therein. These
      composition are made by heating the oil component to a temperature
      of at least above 230 DEG C. for a sufficient time to incorporate
      a predetermined amount of potassium into the oil. At least about
      0.1% can be used, although between 1 and 10% is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      These compositions of the invention may be administered to a
      patient who has cells or tissue which are deficient in potassium
      to increase the potassium content as well as to treat the symptoms
      of diseases or adverse effects caused by the potassium deficient
      cells or tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      I have found that in general, the abnormal cells and tissues in
      the body have free lipids. Thus, a lipid or compound having a
      lipidic character introduced into the body can be selectively
      taken by the abnormal cells. Accordingly, it is believed that a
      potassium compound having lipidic properties is useful as a
      therapeutic agent for patients who have such abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that potassium can be incorporated in the molecule of
      a fatty acid by heating together an organic or inorganic salt of
      potassium with a fatty acid or its oil. Preferably, the fatty acid
      or oil is previously oxidized by being heated and mixed with air
      or oxygen. The mixtures of potassium and fatty acids or oil are
      heated at a temperature above about 230 DEG C. for a time until an
      exothermic reaction is observed, which reaction indicates that the
      incorporation is taking place.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of the potassium/fatty acid or oil compositions that can
      be used according to the invention include the reaction products
      of allylic unsaturated fatty acids or esters and a potassium salt.
      These reaction products are produced by heating a liquid
      composition containing a fatty acid or fatty ester, structurally
      characterized by allylic unsaturation with a potassium salt.
      Applicant believes that any potassium salt may be used in this
      invention. Preferably, the potassium salt is an organic potassium
      salt such as potassium acetate or potassium carbonate, and the
      liquid is preferably oxidized for example, by bubbling air or
      oxygen through the reaction mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil containing polyunsaturated fatty esters, such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated
      vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date
      in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage
      of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the
      compositions useful according to the invention. Such moieties are
      indicated by the following partial structures --CH.dbd.CH--CH2
      --CH.dbd.CH-- and/or --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --. As indicated,
      the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the
      composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions may initially be oxidized or heated in the
      presence of air or oxygen at the temperature range between about
      100 DEG C. and about 150 DEG C. The oxygen can be obtained by
      merely heating the composition in a vessel which is open to the
      atmosphere, but preferably and advantageously, the source of
      oxygen is a gas such as air which is injected into the heated oil.
      Introduction of air also provides a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      The heating step is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. The temperature should be maintained
      at an upper limit within the range of about 230 DEG C. to 250 DEG
      C., and preferably about 235 DEG C. to 240 DEG C. These
      temperature limitations are based on a heating time of about
      one-half hour. The temperatures can be altered within limits
      depending on the time of heating. For example, when the
      temperature is about 235 DEG C., the time is about one-half hour,
      while temperatures as high as 250 DEG C. require a shorter period
      of time for heating. Higher temperatures for a prolonged period of
      time tend to degrade the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Agitation, by stirring for example, aids in the reaction, and
      experiments to date indicate that a fairly violent stirring is
      advantageous. The introduction of air into the mixture during the
      heating is also very advantageous, particularly when the mixture
      is not subjected to prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred
      method. The mixing or stirring can be accomplished with the
      introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, the mixture is cooled. The
      remaining fluid is ready for use after appropriate sterilization
      for injection or incorporated into capsules, such as gelatin, for
      oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the compositions which result from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known. It is known,
      however, that these compositions do include potassium and that a
      proportion of potassium in the range of about 1 to 10 weight
      percent has been found to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, although any potassium salt may be used, an
      organic salt of potassium, such as potassium carbonate or
      potassium acetate, is preferred, with the potassium bonding the
      eleostearic acid present in this oil. Although any amount above
      0.1% of potassium incorporated into the composition is useful, the
      preferred amount ranges between about 1 to 10 weight percent.<br>
      <br>
      The products obtained have the potassium incorporated in general
      at the level of the double bonds of the different unsaturated
      fatty acids, this causes their toxicity to be exceptionally low.
      The injection of 1 ml of a product having 5% potassium to a mouse
      does not kill it.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated potassium composition may be administered orally,
      by injections, sublingually or rectally in the appropriate
      formulation.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated potassium is believed to be absorbed by the
      abnormal cells, thus compensating for their low potassium content.
      This treatment produces objective and subjective improvement in
      the conditions, of patients having a variety of diseases based
      upon such abnormal cells. The neoplastic diseases are examples of
      diseased in which low cellular potassium abnormal cells are found.<br>
      <br>
      Such low cellular potassium abnormal cells are believed to cause
      an catabolic imbalance in the body. This catabolic imbalance can
      be analyzed and diagnosed by blood and urine analyses. A low
      eosinophilia (below 100/cmm), a high red cell sedimentation rate
      (above 15 ml/1 hour), a high serum potassium (above 4.5 mEq), a
      urinary acid pH (below 7), high specific gravity (above 1.016),
      low surface tension (below 89 dynes/cm), and low calcium or
      chloride excretion are indications of an catabolic imbalance. (The
      opposite analyses would indicate a anabolic imbalance.)<br>
      <br>
      These analyses and clinical manifestations have to be changed by
      the administration of the incorporated potassium compound. In a 5%
      potassium incorporated preparation, amounts from about 1/10 to 2
      ml daily are predilectly used for the treatment of this catabolic
      imbalance. For other conditions with anabolic imbalances, doses
      from about 2 to 10 ml daily are predilectly used. In general the
      higher the dose used, the better are the clinical results.<br>
      <br>
      Interesting results are those concerning pain, the changes induced
      in the lesions manifesting first an action upon pain. Manifest
      changes in the tumors and in the subjective manifestations of the
      neoplastic diseases are obtained even in a very short time. Thus,
      the incorporated potassium appears as a predilect treatment of the
      symptoms of neoplastic conditions, and possibly to the treatment
      of such condition themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Good results were also obtained in the use of the incorporated
      potassium compounds for the different manifestations of AIDS
      (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) as well as for the ARC (AIDS
      related complex).<br>
      <br>
      Interesting also are the results in almost all the different
      conditions, such as neurological conditions, epilepsy and others,
      the problem of cellular potassium deficiency being a general
      pathological occurrence. Interesting is the action of the lipidic
      potassium products on the viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated potassium composition may be administered
      together with different other agents.<br>

      A method for making a composition containing a fatty acid or fatty
      ester compound and copper. The compositions produced by the
      method. Administration of these compositions to a patient to
      increase the copper content of cells or tissue having a copper
      deficiency or to treat at least some of the symptoms of diseases
      or adverse effects caused by this copper deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present disclosure concerns a method to treat various
      conditions resulting from copper deficiency and preparations for
      same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      It is known that the abnormal cells in general and the neoplastic
      cells in particular are poor in copper, a fact which is considered
      as including and enhancing their abnormal character. It is also
      known that the blood plasma of subjects with such abnormal
      conditions is especially rich in copper, apparently due to the
      body's attempt to correct the cellular copper deficiency. The form
      under which the copper is circulating in the blood, that is,
      mainly as ceruloplasmin, however, is not the proper form from
      which the copper can be taken by the abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises novel compositions of fatty acids, ester,
      or oils which include copper incorporated therein. These
      composition are made by heating the oil component to a temperature
      of at least above 230 DEG C. for a sufficient time to incorporate
      a predetermined amount of copper into the oil. At least about 0.1%
      can be used, although between 1 and 10% is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      These compositions of the invention may be administered to a
      patient who has cells or tissue which are deficient in copper to
      increase tthe copper content as well as to treat the symptoms of
      diseases or adverse effects caused by the copper deficient cells
      or tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have found that in general, the abnormal cells and tissues in
      the body have free lipids. Thus, a lipid or compound having a
      lipidic character introduced into the body can be selectively
      taken by the abnormal cells. Accordingly, it is believed that a
      copper compound having lipidic properties is useful as a
      therapeutic agent for patients who have such abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that copper can be incorporated in the molecule of a
      fatty acid by heating together an organic or inorganic salt of
      copper with a fatty acid or its oil. Preferably, the fatty acid or
      oil is previously oxidized by being heated and mixed with air of
      oxygen. The mixtures of copper and fatty acids or oil are heated
      at a temperature above about 230 DEG C. for a time until an
      exothermic reaction is observed, which reaction indicates that the
      incorporation is taking place.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of the copper/fatty acid or oil compositions that can be
      used according to the invention include the reaction products of
      allylic unsaturated fatty acids or esters and a copper salt. These
      reaction products are produced by heating a liquid composition
      containing a fatty acid or fatty ester, structurally characterized
      by allylic unsaturation with a copper salt. Applicant believes
      that any copper salt is suitable for this invention. Preferably,
      the copper salt is an organic copper salt such as cupric acetate,
      and the liquid is preferably oxidized for example, by bubbling air
      or oxygen through the reaction mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil containing polyunsturated fatty esters, such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated
      vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date
      in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage
      of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the
      compositions useful according to the invention. Such moieties are
      indicated by the following partial structures --CH.dbd.CH--CH2
      --CH.dbd.CH-- and/or --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --. As indicated,
      the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the
      composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions may initially be oxidized or heated in the
      presence of air or oxygen at the temperature range between about
      100 DEG C. and about 150 DEG C. The oxygen can be obtained by
      merely heating the composition in a vessel which is open to the
      atmosphere, but preferably and advantageously, the source of
      oxygen is a gas such as air which is injected into the heated oil.
      Introduction of air also provides a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      The heating step is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. The temperature should be maintained
      at an upper limit within the range of about 230 DEG C. to 250 DEG
      C., and preferably about 235 DEG C. to 240 DEG C. These
      temperature limitations are based on a heating time of about
      one-half hour. The temperatures can be altered within limits
      depending on the time of heating For example, when the temperature
      is about 235 DEG C., the time is about one-half hour, while
      temperatures as high as 250 DEG C. require a shorter period of
      time for heating. Higher temperatures for a prolonged period of
      time tend to degrade the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Agitation, by stirring for example, aids in the reaction, and
      experiments to date indicate that a fairly violent stirring is
      advantageous. The introduction of air into the mixture during the
      heating is also very advantageous, particularly when the mixture
      is not subjected to prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred
      method. The mixing or stirring can be accomplished with the
      introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, the mixture is cooled. The
      remaining fluid is ready for use after appropriate sterilization
      for injection or incorporated into capsules, such as gelatin, for
      oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the compositions which result from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known. It is known,
      however, that these compositions do include copper and that a
      proportion of copper in the range of about 1 to 10 weight percent
      has been found to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, although any copper salt may be used, an
      organic salt of copper, such as cupric acetate, is preferred, with
      the copper bonding the eleostearic acid present in this oil.
      Although any amount above 0.1% of copper incorporated into the
      composition is useful, the preferred amount ranges between about 1
      to 10 weight percent.<br>
      <br>
      The products obtained have the copper incorporated in general at
      the level of the double bonds of the different unsaturated fatty
      acids, this causes their toxicity to be exceptionally low. The
      injection of 1 ml of a product having 5% copper to a mouse does
      not kill it.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper composition may be administered orally, by
      injections, sublingually or rectally in the appropriate
      formulation.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper is believed to be absorbed by the abnormal
      cells, thus compensating for their low copper content. This
      treatment produces objective and subjective improvement in the
      conditions, of patients having a variety of diseases based upon
      such abnormal cells. The neoplastic diseases are examples of
      diseased in which low cellular copper abnormal cells are found.<br>
      <br>
      Such low cellular copper abnormal cells are believed to cause an
      anabolic imbalance in the body. This anabolic imbalance can be
      analyzed and diagnosed by blood and urine analyses. An
      eosinophilia (above 100/cmm), a low red cell sedimentation rate
      (below 15 ml/1 hour), a low serum potassium (below 4.5 mEq), a
      urinary alkaline pH (above 7), low specific gravity (below 1.016),
      high surface tension (above 89 dynes/cm), and high calcium or
      chloride excretion are indications of an anabolic imbalance. (The
      opposite analyses would indicate a catabolic imbalance.)<br>
      <br>
      These analyses and clinical manifestations have to be changed by
      the administration of the incorporated copper compound. In a 5%
      copper incorporated preparation, amounts from about 2 to 10 ml
      daily are predilectly used for the treatment of this anabolic
      imbalance. For the neoplastic conditions wwith catabolic
      imbalances, low doses from 1/10 to 2 ml daily are predilectly
      used. In general the higher the dose used, the better are the
      clinical results.<br>
      <br>
      Interesting results are those concerning pain, the changes induced
      in the lesions manifesting first an action upon pain. Manifest
      changes in the tumors and in the subjective manifestations of the
      neoplastic diseases are obtained even in a very short time. Thus,
      the incorporated copper appears as a predilect treatment of the
      symptoms of neoplastic conditions, and possibly to the treatment
      of such condition themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Good results were also obtained in the use of the incorporated
      copper compounds for the different manifestations of AIDS
      (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) as well as for thee ARC
      (AIDS related complex).<br>
      <br>
      Interesting also are the results in almost all the different
      conditions, such as neurological conditions, epilepsy and others,
      the problem of cellular copper deficiency being a general
      pathological occurrence. Interesting is the action of the lipidic
      copper products on the viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper composition may be administered together
      with different other agents.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The histones are body constituents which are presently considered
      to be of secondary importance in the protection of the body's
      nucleic acids.<br>
      <br>
      I found that the histones are playing a capital role in biology.
      The body hierarchic organization is made up of successive entities
      at various levels. Each basic entity comprises an electropositive
      principal part bonded to an electropositive secondary part. The
      principal part remains unchanged, protected by the secondary parts
      through its adequate changes.<br>
      <br>
      I found the histones to be formed by a series of histosomes, round
      formations bonded consecutively in a sequence. Each histosome is
      surrounded by its self-manufactured nucleoproteic material. The
      histosomes and the nucleoproteic material together form the
      nucleosomes. The nucleosomes bonded in a row make up the genes.
      The electropositive histones represent the principal part, with
      the electronegative nucleoprotein as the secondary part bonded
      thereto. Together they form the next level in the hierarchy, the
      genes.<br>
      <br>
      The nucleoproteic material as the active part of the gene is
      manufactured by the histones as principal part. As the secondary
      constituent, the nucleoproteic material has the capacity to
      change. Due to this capacity, nucleoproteic material may be
      changed through proper external intervention.<br>
      <br>
      Any abnormal body condition corresponds to abnormal nucleoproteic
      materials, usually with also abnormal histosomes forming together
      abnormal nucleosomes.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic abnormal conditions, such as neoplastic conditions, can
      result from the intervention of specific abnormal histones. I have
      found the histones in general and from the neoplastic material in
      special to have a specific capacity to possess carcinogenic
      properties. The histones from the neoplastic material have a
      specific capacity to possess carcinogenic properties. The repeated
      injections of these histones into mice have induced the appearance
      of different tumors at the site of the injections as well as in
      other parts of the body.<br>
      <br>
      The abnormal conditions which result from the presence of abnormal
      histones and nucleoproteins give rise to a foreign formation known
      as isoparasite. The abnormal neoplastic cells are essentially a
      parasite on the host tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the nucleoproteic material's ability to change, it may
      be changed by injecting the proper substance. The administration
      of foreign nucleoproteic material may act as antiabnormal nucleic
      material and indirectly as antiabnormal histones. The presence of
      an abnormal entity in a body with its own foreign nucleoproteic
      material enables this nucleoproteic material to be changed when a
      new nucleoproteic material is introduced into the body. This has
      led to the use of such foreign nucleoproteic materials in order to
      the change the abnormal nucleoproteic material present in lesions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a process for preparing nucleoproteic
      material which comprises immersing organic materials into a
      suitable solvent for a sufficient time to extract the
      nucleoproteins from these materials, adding a sufficient amount of
      an acid to form a precipitate of nucleoproteic material, and
      recovering said nucleoproteic material precipitate. This
      precipitate may be washed with distilled water and separated again
      by centrifugation or filtration.<br>
      <br>
      In this process, a preferred solvent system is water which is
      slightly alkaline. The material used as a source of nucleoproteins
      is an organic material, especially full animals or their organs,
      including at least liver, spleen, intestines, thymus or testes.
      Microbes, fungi or plants may also be used to obtain
      nucleoproteins.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the solvent may further comprise an alkaline component, such
      that the solvent system has a pH between about 7 and 8. The
      solvent can be heated to boiling to increase the extraction of the
      desired material. A preferred acid for precipitating
      nucleoproteins is acetic acid. The resulting precipitate can be
      recovered by filtration or centrifugation.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the invention relates to compositions of
      nucleoproteic material produced according to the above-described
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, an effective formulation comprises water or alkaline
      containing about 5-50% of the nucleoproteic composition in
      suspension. The pH of the formulation may be adjusted with the
      addition of an alkaline material to a pH range of preferably
      between 5.5 and 6.5.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also contemplates a method for alleviating symptoms
      of neoplastic diseases which comprises preparing a formulation
      comprising an effective amount of the nucleoprotein precipitate,
      sterilizing this formulation, and administering the formulation to
      a patient having symptoms of a neoplastic disease. The symptoms of
      the neoplastic diseases to be alleviated include at least one of
      pain, anemia, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and the presence
      of characteristic abnormal cells and lesions. These formulations
      are preferably administered by intramuscular injections.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Foreign nucleoproteic material is obtained from a chosen material
      through extraction by cold, or preferably, by boiling water. The
      water should preferably be slightly alkaline. This water solution
      may be then acidified by adding acetic acid or other acids. A
      precipitate results, which is then separated by centrifugation or
      filtration. If necessary, this precipitate is treated with sodium
      hydroxide (NaOH) or another alkaline agent to reach a desired pH
      of between approximately 5.0 and 6.5. An adequate portion of the
      product is suspended in water, saline, or other injectable media.
      The so obtained product is then sterilized for injections. This
      material is equivalent to nucleoproteins or nucleoproteins which
      partially may be in the form of salts or esters. Nucleoproteins of
      any biological material may thus be obtained, each product having
      a specific capacity to effectively act on a specific pathogenic
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      An observation of the in vitro (experimentally induced biological
      processes outside the organism) action upon the cultures of cells,
      especially the neoplastic cells, will lead to a determination of
      the most active agents. An observation of in vivo (experimentally
      induced biological processes in the organism) action upon specific
      abnormal conditions, especially neoplastic conditions or diseases,
      is the last means of determining the effectiveness of specific
      agents upon specific pathological conditions. Neoplastic diseases
      is used to mean cancers, sarcomas, leukemias, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The nucleoprotein compounds obtained from the entire body or from
      organs such as the thymus, intestines, liver, spleen and testes of
      various animals have revealed interesting results against various
      symptoms. In an attempt to use more specific agents, nucleoprotein
      compounds obtained from the organs directly involved in the
      pathological condition are employed. The same may be said for the
      neutralizing agent if used in obtaining the respective salts or
      esters of these materials.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred material, carp, is used to provide the nucleoproteins
      because it is known for its longevity, thus indicating a special
      ability to resist disease. The thymus, spleen and intestines, in
      particular, have this special defense capacity. Nucleoproteins
      obtained from the thymus, spleen, or intestines of carp have
      resulted in effective action upon different conditions. In
      general, suspensions from 5% to 50%, preferably approximately 35%,
      in water or saline are used. This concentration has been
      determined through experimental and clinical applications in a
      large variety of acute and chronic abnormal conditions. These
      conditions include pain, anemia, weakness, loss of appetite and
      lesions of a neoplastic nature. Good objective and subjective
      results were obtained in treating neoplastic diseases, such as
      cancers, sarcomas and leukemia, even after a short treatment by
      the use of preparations from carp intestines. Pig organs, such as
      the intestines, are another preferred source of such
      nucleoproteins.<br>
      <br>
      Especially interesting is the use of the nucleoproteins obtained
      from microbes, fungi or plants in the treatment of neoplastic
      conditions in accordance with this invention.<br>
      <br>
      An entire series of pathological conditions has responded within a
      short time of the administration of different preparations of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases of cancer treated with these preparations, effects on
      the existing lesions were objectively and subjectively very
      favorable. In most of the cases, there was a decrease in pain and
      the other associated symptoms following the injections. In a few
      cases, favorable local effects were obtained with only one
      injection. The changes in the lesions that took place within a
      short time are indicative of the effective action of these agents
      upon the lesions themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the precipitated nucleoproteins themselves may be
      used, instead of their salts or esters. Another alternative that
      may be utilized is the product obtained by the water extraction,
      as the material directly extracted through boiling.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that almost all of the subjective and objective results
      obtained in the different cases of cancer treated were favorable
      indicates the value of this specific approach in the fight against
      this disease.<br>
      <br>
      The basic concept of the pathogenic role of specific histones and
      nucleic material, with the consequent therapeutic use of specific
      nucleoprotein compounds, is opening an entirely new field in the
      treatment of general abnormal conditions and specifically in the
      treatment of various neoplastic conditions.<br>

      <br>
      A method for terminating pregnancy which comprises internally
      administering to the body a sufficient amount of a bivalent
      negative sulfur composition to induce menstruation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method for terminating pregnancy by
      administering to the body an amount of elemental sulfur or a
      non-toxic bivalent negative sulfur composition sufficient to
      terminate the pregnancy by inducing menstruation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Examples of non-toxic bivalent negative sulfur compositions that
      can be used according to the invention include the reaction
      products of allylic unsaturated fatty acids or esters and sulfur.
      As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,368,206, such reaction products
      are produced by oxidizing a liquid composition containing a fatty
      acid or fatty ester, structurally characterized by allylic
      unsaturation, for example, by bubbling air through the reaction
      mixture. The fatty acid or ester advantageously includes elemental
      sulfur and/or a conventional free radical initiator such as
      tertiary-butyl peroxide during the heating step.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil containing polyunsatuarated fatty esters, such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated
      vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date
      in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage
      of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the
      compositions useful according to the invention. Such moieties are
      indicated by the following partial structures --CH.dbd.CH--CH2
      --CH.dbd.CH--and/or --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2. As indicated, the
      unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the
      composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions should be oxidized or heated in the presence of
      oxygen at a temperature range between about 110 DEG C. and about
      150 DEG C. The oxygen can be obtained by merely heating the
      composition in a vessel which is open to the atmosphere, but
      preferably and advantageously, the source of oxygen is a gas such
      as air which is injected into the heated oil. Introduction of air
      also provides a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      As previously stated, it is most advantageous to add elemental
      sulfur such as sublimed, precipitated, or washed sulfur to the
      compositions so that the sulfur is present with oxygen during at
      least a portion of the heating period and the sulfur becomes
      incorporated into the composition. Additionally, a previous batch
      of the oxidized oil with or without sulfur or any commonly known
      and available free radical initiator, such as terbutyl peroxide,
      may advantageously be present during at least a portion of the
      heating period.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is added to the selected composition, for example,
      sesame oil, the temperature should be maintained at an upper limit
      within the range of about 120 DEG C. to about 130 DEG C., and
      preferably about 125 DEG C. to 127 DEG C. These temperature
      limitations are based on a heating time of about one-half hour.
      The temperatures can be altered within limits depending on the
      time of heating. For example, the temperature can be 129 DEG-130
      DEG C. if the time is shorter, or at temperatures as high as 150
      DEG C. for brief periods of time. High temperatures for a
      prolonged period of time tend to degrade the composition and
      should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is not present during the heating period, the
      temperature should be maintained in the range between about 110
      DEG C. and about 150 DEG C. and preferably in the range between
      about 120 DEG C. and about 140 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The heat treatment is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. If sulfur is present, optimal results
      are obtained if the heat treatment is conducted for a period of
      time between about 30 minutes and about 1 hour. If a free radical
      initiator is present, or if a selected composition inherently
      contains a significant amount of initiator, the heat treatment
      period may be conducted for a much shorter period of time.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the compositions which result from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known. Also, it appears
      that a correlation exists between a composition useful for the
      purpose of the invnetion and its presumed perioxide or
      hydroperoxide content. By adhering to the process according to
      this invention, it has been found that efficacious compositions
      are produced which yield a significant peroxide titer when
      monitored by conventional iodometric analysis, the results being
      expressed for example, in terms of microequivalents per gram or
      milliequivalents per kilogram. By significant peroxide titer is
      meant a value obtained which is greater than that which inherently
      may be present in the initial untreated compound.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of triglycerides which contain the allylic type
      unsaturation as described above, the resulting oxidized species is
      thought to be a hydroperoxide represented by the following partial
      structure ##STR1## as interpreted via UV spectroscopic analysis,
      inter alia.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the nature of the oxidized species (with or without the
      addition of sulfur), it appears amenable to monitoring by
      conventional iodometric analysis.<br>
      <br>
      Although it appears that the activity of the composition is
      coincident with the presence of perioxides or hydroperoxides, the
      efficacious agent need not necessarily be directly derived from
      these classes. It may be in fact be those species derived from
      radicals resulting from decomposition of compounds of this class
      and may involve reaction with other molecules of, for example,
      triglyceride oils or sulfur including olefinic polymerization
      products and/or lower molecular weight decomposition products of
      the oils or additional products with sulfur such as sulfides,
      disulfides, hydropersulfides, etc.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to a preferred embodiment, it appears that the
      presence of elemental sulfur (approximately 1% by weight based on
      sesame seed oil) during the oxidation of sesame seed oil acts to
      increase the amounts of oxidation products (conjugated
      hydroperoxides, diene, triene, unsaturated carbonyl) and that this
      increase appears optimal near 127 DEG C. as evidenced by UV
      spectroscopic analysis studies. In the absence of sulfur, it
      appears that the region near 137 DEG C. is optimal for the
      production of oxidation products.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, it appears that the most effective
      compositions are those which have a relatively high peroxide
      titer. Such trend of effectiveness agrees in general with the
      results of a peroxide analysis involving the above-identified oils
      in their untreated state and when oxidized in the presence of
      elemental sulfur under similar conditions as shown in Table I.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the lower peroxide titer of cottonseed oil is
      due to the presence of natural antioxidants. The elimination of
      the anti-oxidants from oils such as corn and cottonseed oil or the
      use of the relatively pure allylically unsaturated compounds or
      mixtures thereof will result in a substantially increased peroxide
      titer when treated according to this invention.<br>

      **Within experimental error.<br>
      <br>
      Triolein contains only oleic acid moieties which are characterized
      by the allylically unsaturated group --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --and hence
      is quite difficult to oxidize, * particularly when compared to the
      preferred sesame seed oil or other polyunsaturated oils. A
      peroxide titer value of 35.7 meq/kg has been attained for the
      sesame seed oil-sulfur-oxygen treated composition whle sesame seed
      oil oxidized alone at 137 DEG C. yields a value of 63.3 meq/kg.<br>
      <br>
      J. Sci. Fd. Agric. 1975, 26, 1353-1356. A peroxide titer value of
      35.7 meq/kg [.DELTA.=(35.7-18.8)=16.9] has been attained for the
      sesame seed oil-sulfur-oxygen treated composition while sesame
      seed oil without sulfur oxidized at 137 DEG C. yields a value of
      63.3 meq/kg [.DELTA.=(63.3-10.2)=53.1 ].<br>
      <br>
      Generally a substantial increase in the peroxide titer value can
      be defined as .DELTA.3 to about .DELTA.100 in cases where sulfur
      is incorporated into the composition and as from about .DELTA.3 to
      about .DELTA.400 when the oil is oxidized alone, or in the absence
      of sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      The process used for determining the peroxide titer values
      discussed and reported herein are determined by placing a 2 gram
      sample of the composition in a flask purged with nitrogen, and
      adding thereto 2 ml of concentrated acetic acid and 0.5 grams of
      potassium iodide. The mixture is capped to exclude air and allowed
      to remain in the dark for 30 minutes to complete the reaction. The
      side walls are then wet with a minimum amount of water and
      approximately 1-2 ml of a 2% starch added thereto. The solution is
      then immediately titrated to the end point with 0.007 normal Na2
      S2 O3 solution. The end point is white when small amounts of
      peroxides are present and slightly yellow when larger amounts are
      present.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions as prepared according to the process of this
      invention should be used relatively soon after preparation as
      there is indication that the peroxide titer values and
      effectiveness of the compositions decrease upon aging.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred compositions according to this invention can be prepared
      by adding the sulfur to the oil, such as sesame oil, and heating
      the mixture with agitation at a temperatures of about 130 DEG C.
      For clear solutions, the mixture can be heated between about 120
      DEG C. and 127 DEG C. Heating the mixture above about 130 DEG C.
      for a sufficient time causes a progressive color change in the
      mixture which otherwise does not appear to be detrimental. The
      temperatures given above relate to the use of sulfur with sesame
      oil. Ranges of temperatures which can be used to produce the
      compositions made according to this invention may vary with the
      particular oil being used, but generally temperatures between
      about 120 DEG C. and 150 DEG C. are sufficient for most oils when
      sulfur is added.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred to heat the oil and sulfur at about 150 DEG C. for
      15 minutes to a half hour or until the compositions turn to a
      fairly deep black color. The oil used, together with sublimed or
      precipitated sulfur, is preferably rich in conjugated and
      polyunsaturated acids, such as safflower, corn, cod liver,
      sardine, salmon or tung oil or an oil extract from Bixa orellana
      seeds. The polunsaturated fatty acids can be treated with 50% KOH
      before incorporation of the sulfur therein. The oils having the
      sulfur incorporated therein and the crystals which are separated
      therefrom after cooling can be administered separately but
      preferably together. These compositions heated to about 150 DEG C.
      are presently preferable.<br>
      <br>
      If the oil and sulfur is heated below about 90 DEG C., it is
      difficult to incorporate the sulfur into the oil by heating and
      stirring alone. The best results have been obtained to date by
      maintaining the temperature used in forming the compositions over
      a prolonged period of time from about 30 minutes to one hour.
      Stirring aids in the reaction, and experiments to date indicate
      that a fairly violent stirring is advantageous. The introduction
      of air into the mixture during the heating is also very
      advantageous, particularly when the mixture is not subjected to
      prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred method. The mixing or
      stirring can be accomplished with the introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, the mixture is cooled. The
      remaining fluid is ready for use after appropriate sterilization
      for injection or incorporated into capsules, such as gelatin, for
      oral administration. As mentioned above the sulfur crystals
      remaining in the bottom of the reaction vessel may also be used
      with or without the oil.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of sulfur incorporated into the oil is advantageously
      between about 0.1% to 2.5% by weight, based on the oil. If higher
      amounts of sulfur are used, it will generally precipitate. There
      appears to be no advantage to using higher amounts of sulfur in
      any event since the ultimate dosage given to the patient is the
      criterion, rather than the amount of sulfur content in the oil.<br>
      <br>
      As can be observed from Example 2 below, the incorporation of the
      sulfur into the oil also seems to be limited to about 1% by the
      process presently described and utilized for producing these
      sulfurized unsaturated oils.<br>
      <br>
      The sulfur content can be much less than about 1% if desired and
      smaller sulfur content is advantageous when administered by
      injection. Varying the amount of sulfur below about 1%
      incorporated in the polyunsaturated oils for oral administration
      only affects the number of capsules to be taken at a given time by
      a particular patient.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments to date indicate that the optimum sulfur content for
      oral administrations is about 1% and by injection about 0.1% to
      0.3% by weight of the sulfur based on the weight of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      Further examples of non-toxic bivalent negative sulfur compounds
      that can be used include thiosulfates, thiosinamine, thio or thiol
      compounds, such as thioacids and their non-toxic salts or esters,
      thioglycerol, thioglycol, thiopropanediol, dithiopropanol, ethyl
      sulfide and ethylene sulfide. Colloidal sulfur can also be used.
      Colloidal sulfur has been found to form sulfides in the
      intestines.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also includes the use of selenium in place of
      elemental sulfur and for the same use. When using selenium it is
      combined with the allylic moiety in the same manner as sulfur but
      heated to a temperature in the range of 230 DEG to 250 DEG C.,
      preferably about 240 DEG C. from 15 minutes to an hour or more
      until the peroxide titer value is substantially greater than that
      of the untreated allylic moiety in the same manner as disclosed
      herein with respect to the use of sulfur. These compositions into
      which selenium is incorporated have to date not indicated as good
      an effect as those compositions into which sulfur is incorporated.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of bivalent negative sulfur compound that is
      administered to terminate the pregnancy by including a
      menstruation period will, of course, vary depending upon the
      particular compound being employed, since the activity of the
      sulfur and percentage found therein will be somewhat variable. The
      body weight is also a factor as is well known in the art.
      Generally, for the average size human, a dose of about 1 gram 3 to
      5 times a day is sufficient to terminate the pregnancy by inducing
      menstruation. Therapy can be continued from day to day until
      menstruation reappears. Usually this occurs within 1 to 2 days of
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The inducement of the menstruation and the corresponding
      termination of the pregnancy is effected by a catabolic local
      process, with a lytic action upon the uterine mucuous membrane.
      The administration of these compounds causes predirectly uterine
      catabolic changes which restores the menstruation.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is useful for the treatment of lower animals as well
      as humans.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions are preferably administered orally, but can be
      administered by injection, as suppositories or even vaginally.<br>
      <br>
      An advantageous oral dose has been found to be about 20 drops in a
      gelatine capsule. Patients are generally advised to take one
      capsule twice a day, for two days after which menstruation should
      begin.<br>
      <br>
      When the sulfurized oil is used by injection, such as
      intramuscularly or intraperitoneally, it is advantageous to have
      the sulfur contained in the sulfurized oil below about 0.5% by
      weight, preferably between about 0.1% to 0.3% by weight, and to
      inject for 1/2 to 3 ml of this solution into the patient.
      Experiments to date indicate that the injection of sulfurized oil
      is somewhat painful when it contains above about 0.5% sulfur.
      Administration by injection is, of course, not necessary but it
      may act faster initially. Generally if a person is given the
      initial injection of the sulfurized oil, he can also be given a
      supply of the oral capsules and directed to take 3 to 4 capsules a
      day following the injection for one week.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A sulfurized oil was prepared by mixing 50 grams of sublimed
      sulfur, obtained from Fisher Scientific, with one liter of sesame
      oil. The mixture was heated under fairly rapid agitation by air to
      a temperature of about 127 DEG C. until all of the sulfur was
      incorporated into the sesame oil. The reaction mixture was then
      cooled to room temperature, producing at the bottom of the
      reaction vessel a small amount of sulfur crystals. The crystals
      were then separated from the liquid by filtration and about half
      of the crystals replaced in the resulting liquid, wherein they
      slowly dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting sulfurized oil was then incorporated into gelatin
      capsules in the amount of (about 20 drops) per capsule.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For women of average size, these recommended dosage of such
      capsules is one capsules, twice a day for 2 days, and this has
      been found sufficient in most cases to induce menstruation and
      terminate the pregnancy. One skilled in the art would be able to
      vary the dosage according to the size of the person to be treated;
      4 g. of sulfur were weighed out and placed in an Erlenmeyer flask.
      200 ml of sesame oil were added; the contents were heated to 125
      DEG C. with stirring until the sulfur dissolved. The flask was
      removed from heat and allowed to cool to room temperature (5
      hours). Sulfur crystals were filtered into a Buchner funnel,
      washed thoroughly with hexane to remove residual oil, and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      The above example was repeated three times. The washed sulfur
      precipitate was weighed in each trial and the amount of sulfur in
      the sesame oil calculated by difference as follows:<br>
      Initial weight of sulfur: 4.00 g<br>
      Weight of sulfur ppt.:<br>
      Trial 1 2.05 g<br>
      Trial 2 2.00 g<br>
      Trial 3 1.92 g<br>
      % (w/v) sulfur in sesame oil:<br>
      Trial 1 1.02%<br>
      Trial 2 1.00%<br>
      Trial 3 0.96%<br>
      Average 0.99%<br>
      <br>
      From this it was concluded that the solutions contained
      approximately 1% sulfur after filtration. These formulations were
      substituted into the capsules of Example 1 and were found to
      produce similar results.<br>

      A composition comprising at least one compound containing a cation

      previously described compounds along with a method for
      counteracting the adverse effects of sodium chloride on a human
      body by administering to the body between about 0.5 and 10% of one
      of the disclosed compositions, preferably in a water solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to new and useful improvements in a method
      for counteracting the deleterious effects of sodium chloride on
      the human body. More particularly, the invention relates to the
      administration of specific compositions or mixtures of compounds
      which are antagonists for sodium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has become apparent in recent years that the ingestion of
      sodium chloride, especially at the higher levels to which humans
      have become accustomed, has deleterious effects, mainly related to
      the cardiovascular system, e.g., high blood pressure and
      arteriosclerosis. Such ingestion has also been shown to also
      encourage the growth of tumors. Efforts to restrict the ingestion
      of salt by eating low or unsalted food or substitute alternate
      condiments for salt has not been very successful. Therefore, it is
      preferred to develop non-toxic compounds which counteract the
      effects of salt and which can be ingested separately or along with
      the salt.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,078 suggests one method for achieving this
      result. The patent discloses that the anabolic effects of salt on
      a human body can be reduced by ingesting a compound which has an
      catabolic action. Specifically, the patent discloses that a
      magnesium compound containing bivalent negative sulfur may be
      taken with the salt or separately to offset the effects of the
      salt on the body. The content of that patent is expressly
      incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an improvement in such compounds
      for more effective counteraction of the deleterious effects of
      sodium chloride on the body, particularly with regard to the
      effect of sodium chloride on neoplastic diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a composition comprising the combination
      of at least one compound containing a cation of magnesium,
      calcium, or strontium and an anion of bivalent negative sulfur or
      selenium, and at least one compound containing a cation of lithium
      or potassium and an anion of bivalent negative sulfur or selenium.
      A preferred bivalent negative sulfur is a thiosulfate or
      thiocyanate anion, and these compositions may also contain a
      compound containing a fluoride, silicon or oxygen anion.
      Advantageously, the magnesium, calcium or strontium compounds are
      present in an amount of about 2:1 to 20:1 of the lithium or
      potassium compounds.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to a composition comprising the
      combination of at least one of magnesium, calcium or strontium
      thiosulfate, at least one of magnesium, calcium, or strontium
      thiocyanate, and at least one of lithium or potassium thiosulfate.
      In this composition, the relative amounts of magnesium, calcium
      and strontium thiosulfate to magnesium calcium, and strontium
      thiocyanate to lithium or potassium thiosulfate ranges from about
      2:1:1 to about 20:3:1. The composition can also include lithium or
      potassium fluoride.<br>
      <br>
      An other embodiment of the invention includes compositions of
      sodium chloride along with the compounds described hereinabove. In
      these mixtures, the sodium chloride is present in an amount of
      about 66 to 90 weight percent and preferably between about 75 and
      85 weight percent of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also contemplates a method for counteracting the
      adverse effects of sodium chloride on the human body which
      comprises administering to the body one of the compositions
      described above. These compositions may or may not contain salt.<br>
      <br>
      In this method, the amount of composition to be administered
      ranges from between 0.5 and 10% by weight, and preferably about
      2%, in a water solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,078, it was established that the biological
      activity of various compounds with the body can be classified as
      either anabolic (constructive) or catabolic (destructive). It was
      also shown that sodium chloride has an anabolic effect, whereas
      compounds containing bivalent negative sulfur have a catabolic
      effect. Thus, the anabolic effect of the sulfur counteracts the
      anabolic effect of the sodium chloride. The manifest action of
      sodium chloride upon the appearance and growth of cancers has been
      established through several experiments. Tumors were produced by a
      transplant into the hind leg of rats and mice. These tumors were
      found to grow larger and more rapidly when the animals also
      received sodium chloride in their drinking water. The size and
      growth of the resultant tumors caused the animals to die earlier
      than those who did not ingest the salt.<br>
      <br>
      In groups of 100 exbreeder mice of the strain FC1, the number of
      spontaneous mammary tumors and the death from other conditions was
      recorded, during a one year observation. Spontaneous cancer was
      shown to be increased by the salt intake. In untreated animals,
      considered as controls, the average for 100 animals in one year
      observation was around 44% of spontaneous mammary cancers and of
      15% death from other conditions than cancer. The addition of 2%
      salt in drinking water increased the spontaneous cancer to 65% for
      one year and a mortality of 20% from other conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In animals injected intramuscularly with the carcinogens
      methylcholanthrene or benzyprene, the number of positive results
      was not only markedly increased but the tumors appeared earlier
      when the animals also ingested salt.<br>
      <br>
      All these experiments are indicative of a marked enhancement upon
      the appearance, growth and malignant evolution of cancer by the
      action of ingested sodium chloride<br>
      <br>
      Statistical studies have also shown a relationship between the
      high intake of salt and arteriosclerosis. U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,078
      showed that, in New Zealand rabbits, the intake of 2 g of
      cholesterol daily induced the appearance of aortic atheromatosis,
      and that the addition of salt in the drinking water increases the
      appearance of such atheromas.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is that the diet of people in civilized countries
      includes an amount of salt which is about ten times higher than
      the amount considered to be necessary physiologically. Thus,
      applicant believes that the high occurrence of arteriosclerosis
      and even cancer may be at least partially attributed to this high
      sodium chloride intake.<br>
      <br>
      A study of the biological action of the elements has shown the
      existence of antagonistic actions according to their reciprocal
      characters and position in the periodic table.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the antagonism between the anabolic and catabolic elements
      which is related to the different series to which they belong,
      other antagonistic actions occur between elements in following
      positions in the same series. In the specific case of sodium, the
      first antagonism is seen for the catabolic elements, while the
      second for potassium and lithium, as immediately inferior and
      superior elements in the same A-1 series. Thus, in such a case a
      biological antagonistic action is found to correspond to the
      following cations: magnesium, calcium, strontium, potassium and
      lithium. Chlorine antagonists include the bivalent negative
      sulfur, bivalent negative selenium, silicon, fluorine and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Especially active antagonists of the sodium chloride are the
      thiosulfates, thiocyanates, fluorides and chlorates of magnesium,
      calcium, strontium, potassium and lithium. To these, sodium or
      potassium chlorate may also be added due to their available
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that each of these preparations has a salutary
      effect upon the noxious manifestations of the sodium chloride in
      cancer and arteriosclerosis.<br>
      <br>
      While each one of these products has shown favorable effects by
      itself in the different experiments for counteracting the noxious
      effect of the administration of salt in cancer and
      arteriosclerosis, the concommitant use of two or more of these
      agents have shown improved results through what is believe to be
      synergistic action.<br>
      <br>
      The antisodium agents are used as such or added to the salt
      preparations, and used together. Taste, smell and water solubility
      are the main criteria for choosing from the different compounds,
      those which are not changing the qualities of the salt when added
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that at least two of these agents in combination
      are very effective for counteracting the effects of salt. While
      any combination of bivalent negative sulfur containing compounds
      can be used, the most advantageous compounds to date are those
      containing a combination of nontoxic thiosulfates and
      thiocyanates. Preferably, at least one Group II thiosulfate or
      thiocyanate should be combined with at least one Group I
      thiosulfate or thiocyanate.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the combination of magnesium or calcium thiosulfate
      or thiocyanate with either strontium, potassium or lithium
      thiosulfate or thiocyanate has been found to be suitable for
      preparing formulations of this additive. Also combinations of
      these components can be varied or mixed to provide additional
      formulations which would be suitable.<br>
      <br>
      The following formulas were seen to give particularly good
      results:<br>
      <br>
      Proportion (percent)<br>
      Component Agent A Agent B<br>
      Magnesium thiosulfate<br>
      6 10<br>
      Magnesium thiocyanate<br>
      3 3<br>
      Calcium thiosulfate<br>
      3 3<br>
      Strontium thiosulfate<br>
      1 1<br>
      Potassium thiosulfate<br>
      2 2<br>
      Lithium fluoride 0.03 0.05<br>
      Sodium chloride balance balance<br>
      <br>
      In experiments using rats with Furth tumors transplanted in the
      hind leg, the administration of 2% salt in drinking water has
      increased the tumors (with an average, for 10 rats), to 30% more
      than in the untreated control rats. The use of a 2% mixture of the
      salt plus the antisodium chloride agents -- has induced a manifest
      reduction of the tumor even with 10% below the controls without
      salt and of more than 35% for those having received sodium
      chloride alone. This action was markedly more manifest with the
      administration of the complex than with any compound alone, when
      added to the salt. From these experiments it has appeared
      advisable to use the modified salt to replace ordinary salt.<br>
      <br>
      Mice and rats which received either of the specific complex salts
      listed above in drinking water for over 6 months did not exhibit
      any side effects. When these solutions were given to young
      animals, their growth was not observed to be different from that
      of the control group (i.e. -- those which received no solution).<br>
      <br>
      Based upon these experiments in animals, the continuous use of the
      corrected salt may have a basic influence upon both cancer and
      arteriosclerosis in humans as well.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sulfurized polyunsaturated oils, or sulfurized oils are disclosed
      in a book entitled RESEARCH IN PHYSIOPATHOLOGY AS BASIS OF GUIDED
      CHEMOTHERAPY by Emanual Revici, M.D., published by D. Van Nostrand
      Co., Inc., 1961, pages 334 and 335. A method of preparing
      sulfurized polyunsaturated oils referred to in the book as hydro
      persulfides is set forth in Note 7, page 711 of the book. This
      book does not disclose however, the use of these sulfurized
      compounds for preventing or reducing the desire for smoking
      tobacco as claimed herein. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,869
      discloses a method for preventing or reducing the desire for
      smoking tobacco in humans by the internal administration of a
      composition produced by heating certain allylically unsaturated
      compounds which are sufficient to substantially increase the
      peroxide titer. The incorporation of sulfur into the composition
      during this heating process has been found to be particularly
      advantageous. This patent is expressly incorporated herein by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant has now discovered that a number of additional compounds
      are effective for eliminating or reducing the desire for smoking.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a method for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of a tobacco habit or addiction in a human by
      controlling the craving for tobacco or by controlling tobacco
      withdrawal symptoms by internally administering a compound with an
      active ingredient containing at least one bivalent negative sulfur
      in an amount effective to control the craving or the withdrawal
      symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      The most clinically effective anti-smoking compounds for use as an
      active ingredient are hydropersulfides, alkyl sulfides, colloidal
      sulfur, organic thio compounds or their pharmaceutically
      acceptable salts. The most effective thio compounds have proven to
      be thioglycerols, thioglycols or their pharmaceutically acceptable
      salts.<br>
      <br>
      These compounds are amenable to oral administration into the human
      body by mixing the active ingredient with suitable binders and
      bulking materials and placing an amount of the active material
      which is equal to a therapeutic dosage level into a pharmaceutical
      capsule.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred theraputic dosage level is 100 milligrams of the
      active ingredient and the subject should be instructed to ingest a
      sufficient number of capsules so as to effect a cessation or
      reduction in his desire to smoke. The active ingredient may also
      be administered however, by means of an injection, which allows
      the sulfur compound to work faster initally. The most clinically
      effective active ingredient is ethylene trithiocarbonate,
      thioglycerols, and thioglycol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to have a technique for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of the tobacco habit or addiction in a human by means of
      a method for controlling the craving for tobacco and/or by
      reducing or controlling the symptoms of withdrawal. The invention
      disclosed herein relates to such methods of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Testing of the products produced by tobacco smoking shows them to
      possess, in general, a manifest anabolic action. These studies
      have concerned the fluorescence of the products found in the
      tobacco smoke and have disclosed the presence of carcinogenic
      agents which emit energy. Applicant has discovered that the
      administration of catabolic agents to a human subject, which
      agents are antagonistic to the anabolic effects of tobacco
      by-products, is an extremely satisfactory technique for
      counteracting the subject's desire to smoke.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has also discovered that certain catabolic agents,
      especially active at higher levels of the body organization, are
      more specifically active than others against the physiological
      changes induced by smoking tobacco. The preferred catabolic agents
      for performing this function are bivalent negative sulfur
      compounds which experimentation has shown to be most efficacious.
      The following specific compounds have been found to be
      particularly effective in clinical tests for eliminating or
      reducing the desire for smoking: hydropersulfides, alkyl sulfides,
      colloidal sulfur and organic thio products, which include but is
      not limited to thioglycerols and thioglycols, or other
      pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Applicant has found that the
      best results are obtained through the use of the thioglycols
      thisglycerols and, specifically, ethylene trithiocarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the compounds
      disclosed herein, may also be mixed with the compounds disclosed
      in U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,869.<br>
      <br>
      The method of administration for these compounds may be either
      oral or parenteral and the intended effect, that of diminishing
      the subject's desire to smoke, may be obtained even after only one
      of two administrations of these agents. For purpose of the
      preferred oral note of administration, the active material may be
      mixed with binders and bulking agents and therapeutic dosages such
      as 100 milligrams, may be placed in pharmaceutical capsule for
      dispensing to a subject.<br>
      <br>
      The dosage prescribed to a patient will, of course, vary depending
      upon the particular patient and the number of cigarettes being
      smoked per day. In general a daily dosage should consist of about
      3-5 capsules containing 100 mg. each of the active ingredient for
      the first three days after which the dosage level should be
      progressively reduced in accordance with the subject's reduced
      desire to smoke. As noted, however, smoking patterns vary and a
      heavy smoker may require as many as eight capsules per day for the
      first three days which could then be reduced to 3-4 capsules per
      day for the next four days. This is generally sufficient to
      eliminate or reduce a smoker's desire or need for tobacco. A
      single course of treatment may retain its effect for months but
      the smoker may also be provided with a supply of the capsules in
      case the desire for tobacco returns.<br>

      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of the manifestations of alcoholism or alcohol addiction
      by aiding in the control of the craving for alcohol or by aiding
      in the control of alcohol withdrawal symptoms or by aiding in the
      control of alcohol intoxification in a human by internally
      administering a compound with an active ingredient containing at
      least one bivalent negative sulfur in an amount sufficient to
      control the craving for alcohol or the symptoms caused by
      abstaining from it.<br>
      <br>
      The most clinically effective compounds for this purpose are the
      hydropersulfides, alkyl sulfides, colloidal sulfur and organic
      thio compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The
      most effective thio compounds to date are the thioglycerols and
      ethylenetrithio carbonate or their pharmaceutically acceptable
      salts.<br>
      <br>
      These compounds are amenable to oral administration into the human
      body by mixing it with suitable binders or bulking materials, and
      placing an amount of the active material which is equal to a
      therapeutic dosage level into a pharmaceutical capsule.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred therapeutic dosage level is about 100 milligrams of
      the active ingredient and the subject should be instructed to
      ingest a sufficient number of capsules to reduce or eliminate the
      desire to drink or to reduce or eliminate the affects of alcohol.
      The active ingredient may also be administered, however, by means
      of an injection, which allows the active ingredient to work more
      quickly, initially. The most clinically effective active
      ingredient is ethylene trithio carbonate and thioglycerols.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAIILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is desirable to have a method for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of alcoholism in a human by controlling the craving for
      alcohol, by controlling withdrawal symptons, or by aiding in the
      control of alcohol intoxication by humans. It is further desirable
      to have a method for aiding the control of alcohol intoxication of
      a non-alcoholic person by reducing or eliminating the effects
      alcohol intoxication upon him as well.<br>
      <br>
      A series of tests run on alcoholic compounds by the applicant has
      shown them to possess a manifest anabolic action, due to the
      presence of a positively charged hydroxyl (OH) group. This
      anabolic action is also due to the solubility of the alcohols in
      lipids, which are fatty substances found in the human body. Due to
      the small number of carbon atoms which form the organic structure
      of ethyl alcohol (CH3 CH2 OH) and of other alcohols present in
      alcoholic beverages, the anabolic action referred to hereinabove
      is manifested at the higher levels of the body's hierarchic
      organization, i.e., mainly the organic and systemic levels.<br>
      <br>
      Alcoholic compounds induce the typical anabolic manifestations,
      which include a preliminary excitation stage followed by a
      relaxant stage. The applicant has discovered that the
      adminstration of catabolic agent to a human subject, which is
      antigonistic to the anobolic effect of alcohol, is an extremely
      satisfactory technique for counteracting the subject's desire to
      drink. These agents therefore are indicated for the treatment of
      all of the manifestations following the intake of alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has discovered that certain catabolic agents,
      especially those active at higher levels of the body organization,
      are more specifically active than others against the physcological
      changes which occur in a human subject subsequent to the
      consumption of alcohol. The preferred catabolic agents for
      performing this function are bivalent negative sulfur compounds
      which clinical testing has shown to be the most efficacious
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      The following specific compounds have been found to be
      particularly effective in clinical tests for eliminating or
      reducing the effects of alcohol consumption: hydropersulfides,
      alkyl sulfides, colloidal sulfur and organic thio products, mainly
      thioglycerols and ethylene trithio carbonate. The applicant's
      invention should not, however, be limited solely to the compounds
      listed above. The applicant has found that the most favorable
      results occur with the use of ethylene trithiocarbonate. The
      method for administration of these compounds may be through either
      the oral or parenteral route and it is important to note that the
      antianabolic action of these compounds is also manifested by an
      actual reduction in the amount of alcohol present in the blood of
      the subject. The dosage prescribed to a patient will, of course,
      vary depending upon the physical size and physiological
      characteristics of a particular patient and, since drinking
      patterns vary, the amount of alcohol consumed must also be taken
      into account in determining the correct dosage.<br>
      <br>
      Generally speaking, however, for purposes of the preferred oral
      route of administration, the active material may be mixed with
      acceptable binders and bulking agents and therapeutic dosages of
      100 milligrams, may then be placed in phamaceutical capsules for
      dispensing to a subject. For the average individual, a daily
      dosage of about 3-5 capsules containing 100 milligrams each of the
      active ingredient for the first 3 days after which the dosage
      level would be progressively lowered in accordance with the
      subject's reduced desire to drink. A heavy drinker may require as
      many as 8 capsules per day for the first 3-4 days, which could
      then be reduced to 3-4 capsules per day for the next four days.
      This should be a sufficient dosage to eliminate or reduce the
      subject's need for alcohol or to reduce or eliminate its effects
      after consumption.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the compounds
      disclosed hrein may also be mixed with the compounds disclosed in
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,368,206. Therefore, the teachings of this patent
      are expressly incorporated herein.<br>

      <br>
      A method for treating drug addiction from compounds which cause a
      catabolic effect on the human body, which comprises administering
      to said body, a sufficient amount of an anabolic agent containing
      bivalent negative selenium or sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to methods and compositions for treating
      drug addiction, particularly for the treatment of the symptoms of
      withdrawal when the patient terminates using drugs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      In treating patients for drug addiction, the most common method
      employed is that of allowing the patient to "dry out" or eliminate
      the drug from their system. This period, called withdrawal, is a
      very difficult time for the patient, since the body is in need of
      the drug due to its previous habitual use and dependence thereon.<br>
      <br>
      It was previously not recognized that the effect of the drug on
      the body would be counteracted by administering a compound which
      produces an opposite effect on the body so as to offset and
      neutralize the detrimental defense effects of the body. The
      present invention provides one such solution for this problem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for treating drug addiction from
      compounds which cause a catabolic fatty acids defense effect on
      the human body, which comprises administering to said body, a
      sufficient amount of antifatty acids agents, preferred antifatty
      acid agents includes a variety of agents comprised of selenium and
      sulfur compounds. The active ingredient of these agents can be
      administered orally or by injection. Preferred dosages include
      about 10 ml of the oil (about 0.5 to 1 gram).%<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to a method for treating drug addiction
      from compounds which cause a catabolic noxious effect on the human
      body, which comprises admistering to said body, a sufficient
      amount of antifatty acid agents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      My study concerning drug addiction and the symptoms of withdrawal
      is based on the recognition of a dualism, in the pathogenisis of
      the condition and the action of such agents on the human body.
      This dualism is shown in the antagonistics of the
      anabolic-constructive and catabolic-destructive conditions, of
      such agents. In the pathogenesis of the anabolic condition,
      abnormal sterols intervene while in the pathogenisis of the
      catabolic condition, abnormal fatty acids having as characteristic
      the presence of trienic conjugated formations intervene.
      Clinically, these catabolic conditions are observed as insomnia,
      diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, generalized are localized pair,
      particularly in the bones and joints, horiplations and tremors in
      the patent. The stronger the catabolic condition of the drug agent
      the more intensive the clinic manifestations.<br>
      <br>
      In order to determine whether the agents are either anabolic or
      catabolic in effect, an entire series of tests must be conducted.
      In the test of pH of second day wound crust, an anabolic agent
      induces a lower pH, while a catabolic agent produces a higher pH.
      In the study of the curve of healing wounds, an anabolic agent
      makes any peaks disappear, while the catabolic agent increases a
      leukocytosis, eosinophilia, a lowering of the serum potassium and
      more free water, while the catabolic agent causes directly
      opposite changes. In higher specific gravity, a lowering of the
      chlorides and of calcium excretion.<br>
      <br>
      By applying this research to the problem of any addiction it was
      found that the agents which induce an addiction have typical
      anabolic characters, and their action induces a typical anabolic
      imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      By applying the influence exerted by these various agents upon the
      oxygen uptake of cancer cells, suspension or yeast, using the YST
      oxygen monitor, it was found that, over a period of time, the
      anabolic agents reduced the uptake of oxygen, while the catabolic
      agents increased it. However, for the anabolic agents, their
      initial action caused an increase in the oxygen uptake was taking
      place. This paradoxical action was induced in fact by the action
      of low amounts of the active agent. This paradoxical action seen
      in the oxygen uptake test also explains the clinical action with
      two phases for the addictive drugs studied. The first phase
      corresponds to a cerebral excitration, followed by the second, of
      deep sleep, corresponding to a typical anabolic action. This is
      seen for the narcotics with a primary excitation, followed by deep
      sleep.<br>
      <br>
      The recognition of the typical anabolic character for the
      addicting drugs, represents the first fundamental discovery for
      the treatment of this problem.<br>
      <br>
      In a study of body defenses, I found that the body defends itself
      against an anabolic agent which is repeatedly introduced, by
      manufacturing antagonistic lipids having a catabolic
      character--i.e., fatty acids. The abnormal nature of these fatty
      acids is due to the presence of trienic conjugated formations. The
      defense character of these fatty acids appears in two ways. First,
      in their relationship with the anabolic drug, which corresponds to
      a reciprocal neutralization whereby the fatty acids neutralize the
      anabolic drug, while the anabolic drug neutralizes the noxious
      action of the abnormal fatty acids. Also, due to its defense
      character, the body has a tendency to increase its manufacture of
      the necessary neutralization agents. Due to this reciprocal
      neutralization, the presence of an excess of the defensive fatty
      acids requires the need for the drug in order to neutralize it.
      The more drugs introduced, the more fatty acids are manufactured
      in a defense action; the more fatty acids are present, the more
      the need for the drug to neutralize them. This explains the two
      manifest characters of addiction, the appearance of the need for
      the drug, and the progressive increase of this need.<br>
      <br>
      In withdrawal, the high amount of the catabolic defense fatty
      acids remains in the body, since they do not have the anabolic
      drug to neutralize them. It is the presence of these fatty acids
      which induce the manifestations of withdrawal. The symptoms are
      typically catabolic as occur due to the action of the abnormal
      fatty acids; i.e., insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting, cramps,
      perspiration, pain in the bones, and horipilations. Dienic and
      trienic conjugated formations are found through spectral analysis
      present in the urines. Analytical data of blood and urine show the
      presence of such catabolic conditions. The presence of an urinary
      strong alkalosis indicates the presence of this catabolic
      imbalance directly affecting the systemic level.<br>
      <br>
      The recognition of a catabolic imbalance, due to the presence of
      high amounts of noncompensated abnormal fatty acids, constitutes
      the main character of the drug withdrawal condition. An action
      upon these fatty acids represents the consequent therapeutic
      intervention.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous means to act upon these abnormal trienic conjugated fatty
      acids have now been discovered. In one, an oxidation of the
      abnormal fatty acids was considered. In the study of the actions
      upon such fatty acids, it appears interesting to note their
      oxidating change under specific conditions. Several specific
      characters have been found to effect this change. In one, the
      agent has a lipidic character. This appeared to be effective due
      to the affinity between lipids and the primary character of the
      fatty acids which are lipids.<br>
      <br>
      The action of selenium was also found to work well when used in
      the bivalent negative state. I found a fundamental difference
      between bivalent negative and tetra and hexavalent positive
      selenium. The bivalent negative selenium has an oxidation
      character similar to that of the minus 2 of oxygen, and has
      different effectiveness than the tetra or hexavalent positive
      oxidation states.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, preparations having bivalent negative selenium and
      lipidic characters are preferred. For this aim, a method for
      introducing these elements into unsaturated fatty acids was
      developed.<br>
      <br>
      By heating an oil, such as an unsaturated fatty acid or a mixture
      of them, at a critical temperature, the double bonds open. At this
      place, therefor, an element can be attached. For a bivalent
      negative selenium the result of this attachment of one atom
      corresponds to an epoxy, while two atoms correspond to a peroxy,
      depending upon the exact temperatures used.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, a mixture of a vegetable oil and gray
      or red selenium is heated until the selenium is incorporated. This
      occurs around 215 DEG C., when the solution becomes clear.
      Polyunsatured vegetable oils have been found to be the most
      advantageous for use in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred polyunsatured vegetable oil is sesame seed oil,
      although any naturally occurring vegetable, animal or fish oil can
      be utilized. Alternately, the same mixture can be heated to above
      240 DEG C. until foaming has ceased. Either of these two
      preparations can be used separately or preferably mixed together.
      The preferred route of administration is by intramuscular
      injection. These preparation whether used separately or in
      combination, have been shown to possess an extemely low toxicity
      in both animals and humans.<br>
      <br>
      In very severe cases of withdrawal, from methadone for example, a
      number of doses of from 0.5 to 1 gram % selenium in this oil were
      injected per day, and this without any subjective or objective
      side effects. In general, much lower doses are preferred in order
      to induce an efficient detoxification. The doses are indicated by
      the clinical response of the patient, and they may be increased if
      any withdrawal symptoms remain. It is preferable to prevent any
      withdrawal symptoms from occurring in the patient.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in the patient were evident in the blood analyses. The
      original withdrawal symptoms were unusually controlled by a single
      injection of about 10 ml, the effect is being seen within 45
      minutes. A treatment of several days is necessary to obtain a good
      detoxification which would continue as long as the subject did not
      again take the addicting drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Members of the following groups of agents represent other
      compositions to treat or intervene in the treatment of drug
      withdrawal by acting upon these abnormal fatty acids. They may be
      used alone or preferably in combination with the selenium-oil
      mixture. The agents are lipoidal in character, i.e., they are more
      soluble in neutral solvents than in water so that they act
      directly upon the fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      Such groups include: selenium as a bivalent negative liposoluble
      compounds, such as organic selenides and selenium incorporated in
      fatty acids; sulfur as colloidal sulfur; crystals from sulfurized
      or selenized oil; thiosulfates; thioglycerols; thioglycols;
      ethylene trithio carbonate; organic lipidic bivalent negative
      sulfides, disulfides, mercaptans; lipidic compounds or
      incorporated in oils or fatty acids; lipsoluble ethers, preferably
      butyl ether and butyl-oxy-phenyl ether; fatty alcohols and also
      these obtained as mixtures, by treating the fatty acids of animal
      or vegetable oils with lithium-aluminum-hydride.<br>
      <br>
      Sterols obtained especially as unsaponifiable fractions from fats,
      oils, organs, organism or other biological material, i.e., more
      soluble in neutral solvents than in water. Other groups are the
      lipidic alcohols, i.e., those which are more soluble in neutral
      solvents than in water, such as pentanol, heptanol, 3-pentanol and
      3-heptanol, pentyl and heptylamines and especially 3-heptylamine.
      Lipidic aminoalcohols, liposoluble epoxide and peroxides; the
      anabolic elements of the 1A, 111 A, VA, V11 A, 11 B, 1V B, V1 B,
      and iron and nickel series, and liposoluble corticoids are also
      useful according to the invention. With adequate or sufficient
      amounts, favorable action was obtained with members of each group.<br>
      <br>
      It has appeared advantageous to use combinations of members of
      more than one group, and this reduced the inherent side effects of
      each agent. Most advantageously, these combinations should be used
      together with the selenium incorporated in oil.<br>
      <br>
      The clinical applications show the need to have the treatment
      continued for several days after all the symptoms of withdrawal
      have fully disappeared. This is done in order to control the
      natural body tendency to continue to manufacture the abnormal
      fatty acids as a defensive action.<br>

      fluorine containing acids can also be employed. The ammonia (NH3)
      salts are at present perferred. The organic fluorine containing
      acid can contain various amounts of fluorine atoms, however, a
      significant decrease in activity appears to result when these
      acids contain 20 or more fluorine atoms. It is thus advantageous
      to employ fluorine containing organic acids having less fluorine
      atoms. Best results to date are obtained with perfluorooctanoic
      acid and hexafluorophosphoric acid, particularly their ammonium
      salts. The fluorine containing acids can also be used in
      admixtures with each other.<br>
      <br>
      The fluorine containing acids can be water soluble or water
      insoluble and either can be used directly in solution, e.g., water
      or alcohol, or in conventional therapeutic emulsion form.<br>
      <br>
      The required dosage will, of course, depend upon the particular
      fluorine containing acid being employed as well as the extent of
      the neoplasm in the patient. Generally, especially with
      hexafluorophosphoric acid, from about 100 mcg. to 50 milligrams is
      sufficient. The appearance of a slight dizziness is a factor
      limiting the use of progressively increasing dosages. The
      treatment can be continued at various intervals, preferably daily,
      until maximum effect is obtained. Administration can be orally or
      by injection.<br>
      <br>
      No claim is made that the use of fluorine containing acids will
      cure neoplasms but subjective improvements result in various
      symptoms of neoplastic conditions, such as cancers, sarcomas,
      lymphomas, leukemias as well as in benign tumors. The use of the
      fluorine containing acids is noted to reduce pain and alleviate
      other known symptoms of neoplastic conditions. The invention is
      useful for treating symptoms of neoplasms in the lower animals as
      well as in humans.<br>

          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      A method and composition for the treatment of a patient with AIDS.
      The composition comprises an AIDS-symptom alleviating effective
      amount of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having an odd number of
      carbon atoms and containing at least 5 and not more than 10 carbon
      atoms. The composition may be administered in a pharmaceutically
      acceptable oily carrier and is administered orally and/or by
      intramuscular injection.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The study of the pathogenic factors of diseases caused by the HIV
      virus, e.g., the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has
      shown that, in addition to the presence of the virus, parasitated
      lymphocytes which have been infected by the virus are present
      which represent the detectable lesions of the of the disease.
      Accordingly, in a therapeutic approach to this disease, an attempt
      to destroy the parasitated lymphocytes must be considered, in
      addition to treatment having a direct antiviral action.<br>
      <br>
      Studies of the parasitated or infected lymphocytes has shown that
      they, like other lesions in the body, contain free lipids. They
      are especially sensitive to the action of agents having a lipidic
      character when introduced into the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      I have discovered that certain lipidic agents have a specific
      capacity to act upon the pathogenic factor of AIDS. These agents
      act upon the virus itself, as well as the infected or parasitated
      lymphocytes. In particular, I have discovered that aliphatic
      organic compounds having five or more carbons and a lipidic
      character, i.e., are soluble in unpolarized or organic solvents
      rather than water, provide an effective procedure for the
      treatment of AIDS. These compounds appear to be bound by the
      viruses and the parasitated lymphocytes through the free lipids of
      the virus and lymphocytes.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, I have found that compounds having a negative
      polar group and, especially, an acidic polar group, exhibit a
      characteristic antiviral activity and effect in decreasing the
      number of parasitated lymphocytes.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the invention comprises administering to a patient
      with AIDS, an anti-AIDS symptom reducing effective amount of an
      organic aliphatic acid having at least 5 carbon atoms and an odd
      number of carbon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Organic acids particularly suitable for use with the present
      invention are pentanoic, nonanoic and heptanoic acid. Most
      preferred is heptanoic acid. Each of these compounds exhibit not
      only anti-HIV virus effects, but also affect the parasitated or
      infected lymphocytes, killing them.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds are administered intramuscularly or orally from oily
      solutions. Conventional organic oils which are pharmaceutically
      acceptable may be used as the oily carrier. Typically, for
      example, vegetable oils, and most preferably, polyunsaturated oil,
      such as, safflower oil, are suitable. For oral administration, a
      solution having a concentration from about 20 to 60%, and
      preferably, about 50% and in amounts of from about 1 to 5 ml per
      dosage, two to four times a day, are effective. For intramuscular
      injection, oily solutions having concentrations up to 30% acid may
      be used with injection volumes being from about 2 to 10 ml per
      injection, one to four times per day. (All concentrations are
      expressed as volume/volume percent.) I have found that these
      administrations are well tolerated. The inventive method may be
      utilized with oral or intramuscular injection alone or in
      combination. The administration of the medicament may be continued
      for as long as necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Toxicity studies with these acids have shown that they are
      essentially non-toxic in mice after repeated injections of 0.5 ml
      of a 10% volume/volume solution for more than two months. No toxic
      effects were observed in rats with daily injections of 1 ml of a
      10% volume/volume solution.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, for all of the patients described hereinafter, no
      complaints of any side effects were received, even when relatively
      large amounts of medication were administered.<br>
      <br>
      A group of forty AIDS patients was treated utilizing heptanoic
      acid. The patients were diagnosed as having AIDS by conventional
      analysis. These patients were each treated orally with heptanoic
      acid in safflower oil, in 50% oily solution, in doses from 2-5 ml,
      two to four times a day for more than one month. Impressive
      subjective changes and improvements in the condition of each of
      the patients were seen, even beginning after the first
      administration. No toxic effects after prolonged treatment with
      higher amounts were observed.<br>
      <br>
      Ten patients diagnosed with AIDS and having chronic diarrhea were
      treated. These patients had chronic diarrhea for more than month
      which did not respond to any conventional treatment. They received
      from 2-5 ml of the 50% heptanoic acid orally in safflower oil,
      three to four times a day. Using this inventive method, this
      symptom was fully controlled within a period of less than one week
      in each of these patients.<br>
      <br>
      This treatment has also produced significant changes in the ratio
      of helper to suppressor lymphocytes. Generally, the normal ratio
      of helper to suppressor lympho cytes should be about 1.2. With
      patients having AIDS, this ratio is as low as 0.1. With the
      inventive treatment, improvements in increasing this ratio are
      seen beginning with the initial treatment and continuous
      improvement has been seen after treatments for a period of one
      month.<br>
      <br>
      The following are details of two of the forty clinical treatments
      referred to above.<br>
      <br>
      J. D., 38 years old, with a T4 /T8 ratio of 0.14, exhibited severe
      manifestations of AIDS, including diarrhea and fever. Within one
      week of treatment with 3 ml of a 50% volume/volume heptanoic acid
      in safflower oil, these symptoms were fully controlled. After a
      two-month treatment of 2 ml of this medication three times a day
      orally, he remained symptom free for six months without any
      further treatment. His T4 /R8 ratio remained at a level of about
      1.0.<br>
      <br>
      L. S., 24 years old, diagnosed with AIDS. He was rapidly
      deteriorating for the month prior to his beginning treatment. The
      manifested symptoms were primarily fatigue, loss of weight, loss
      of appetite, fever and multiple lymphatic gland involvement. The
      T4 /T8 ratio was 0.2. Within one week of treatment with 3 ml of
      50% volume/volume heptanoic acid in safflower oil, orally four
      times a day, these symptoms were controlled.<br>
      <br>
      After two months of treatment, the patient has remained in
      exceptional good clinical condition for the last six months,
      continuing with the treatment of 1 ml administered once a day. His
      T4 /T8 ratio remain above 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      In another variant of the present invention, a mixture of 30%
      heptanoic acid, 15% pentanoic acid, and 15% nonanoic acid
      (volume/volume percentage) in safflower oil were used orally with
      from 1 to 3 ml dosages four times a day. Clinical results in 12
      patients with varying pathological AIDS manifestations all
      resulted in substantial improvements of their symptoms.<br>
      <br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Selenium compounds having
            antineoplastic activity, process for the preparation thereof
            and pharmaceutical compositions therefrom</b><b><br>
          </b><b>US4564634</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      Organic compounds of selenium are prepared by reaction of metallic
      selenium with eleostearic acid under warming. Tung oil may be
      used. The compounds contain between 0.1 and 5% by weight of
      selenium. Pharmaceutical compositions having antineoplastic
      activity are prepared, which contain as the active component, the
      organic compound of selenium. The method of treatment of animals
      and humans affected by neoplastic conditions is described.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to new organic compounds of
      selenium, which exhibit a substantial antineoplastic activity.
      More specifically, the invention covers compounds prepared by
      addition of selenium to eleostearic acid. This substance is
      9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid of formula<br>
      <br>
      CH3 --(CH2)3 --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--(CH2)7 --COOH<br>
      <br>
      This acid is a fatty acid and is the chief component (about 80%)
      in "tung oil", also called "china wood oil". According to a
      preferred method for the preparation of the compounds according to
      the present invention, "tung oil" is used as a source of
      eleostearic acid. By warming metallic selenium with eleostearic
      acid, or more appropriately with "tung oil", at a temperature in
      the range of 200 DEG-250 DEG C., one notices the disappearance of
      selenium itself with formation of an addition product in which
      selenium is bound to the chain of the fatty acid with bonds of
      various nature (for instance a perselenide, or hydroperselenide,
      or episelenide bond or others).<br>
      <br>
      The percentage of selenium in the compounds prepared in this
      manner may vary within a very broad range, for instance between
      0.1% up to 5%. However, for the therapeutical use, compounds
      containing 1-2% by weight of selenium are particularly useful.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to the method of preparation of the
      novel compounds of the invention which comprises warming selenium
      with "tung oil" up to the point when the mixture becomes clear,
      that is when the elementary selenium disappears. The following
      example illustrates the method of preparation according to the
      invention without, however, limiting the invention in any way.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><br>
      <br>
      Selenium, either in the gray or red form, three grams finely
      powdered, is warmed gradually in 100 grams of tung oil under
      efficient stirring in a bath of dowtherm. At a temperature of
      about 230 DEG C., the mixture begins to become clear and becomes
      completely clear at a temperature of about 248 DEG C. This
      requires about 2-3 hours of heating. After an additional one
      half-hour of heating while under efficient stirring, the mixture
      is allowed to cool and the selenium which has not reacted and
      which has collected as a single clot, is decanted.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid which is obtained contains 2.03% of selenium, the
      determination being made by atomic absorption. The ultraviolet
      spectrum of the compound which will be referred to hereinbelow by
      the symbol "TSel" exhibits absorption maxima typical of conjugated
      trienes and conjugated dienes. This fact coupled with the
      determination of the iodine number, which is carried out with
      sodium thiosulfate and determining the amount of iodine set free
      in the reaction between TSel and potassium iodide in acetic acid,
      shows the presence of selenium bound to carbon atoms adjacent the
      double bond of a triene in the form of a hydroperselenide group
      (.dbd.C--C--Se--Se--H), and selenium added to a double bond in the
      form of a perselenide ##STR1## It should be clarified, however,
      that the novelty of the invention is not in any way limited to the
      manner of how the selenium is bound in TSel, or more generally, in
      the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The substance TSel thus obtained may be administered as such in
      the form of drops of 50% diluted with sesame oil and administered
      in unit dosage form in capsules of gelatine or in phthials for
      injection. The substance in a 2% concentration of selenium
      prepared as described hereinabove, has been investigated to
      determine the acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, chronic toxicity
      and carcinogenic activity. The results are reported hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Acute Toxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      The acute toxicity of TSel has been tested in mice and rats of
      both sexes, treated with increasing doses of TSel administered
      subcutaneously, intraperitoneally and intragastrically.<br>
      <br>
      By the subcutaneous route, no death has been observed when the
      substance is administered up to 1 cc of TSel in mice (26-32 g
      .female. and 28-34 .male.) and up to 2 cc in rats (150-220 g
      .female. and 170-230 g.male.). By the intraperitoneal route, the
      maximum doses which have not caused death, are 0.2 cc for female
      mice, 0.5 cc for male mice and 0.8 cc for rats of both sexes. The
      maximum doses which have been tested, 1 cc for mice and 1.5 cc for
      rats, have caused death in at least 50% of the animals with the
      exception of female mice which have shown to be more sensitive.
      The autopsy has shown an atrophization of the suprarenal glands
      with almost a total disappearance of sudanophilic material.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the administration by the intragastric route of
      the material up to 1 cc in mice and 2 cc in rats of both sexes has
      not caused toxic symptoms worth mentioning with the exception of
      the reduction of the sudanophilic material in the suprarenal
      glands at the higher dosage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Subacute Toxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      Subacute toxicity has been studied by administration of increasing
      doses of TSel for six consecutive days to mice and rats of both
      sexes by the subcutaneous route and by the intragastric route and
      in guinea pigs by the intragastric route.<br>
      <br>
      By the subcutaneous route, only at the highest dose of 0.3 cc,
      there is observed the death in the treated mice, (1/10 in the
      female and 2/10 in the male) while no pathological symptoms have
      been observed in rats treated up to 0.3 cc per 100 grams.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment by the intragastric route has caused no toxic
      symptoms worth mentioning, with the exception of a slight
      gastritis at the highest doses in the case of mice (0.3 cc) and
      rats (0.5 cc). The treatment was, on the other hand, tolerated
      very well by guinea pigs also at the highest dosage of 0.4 cc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chronic Toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mice weighing 30 grams were subjected to a subcutaneous injection
      in the amount of 0.1 cc per day, three times a week for a period
      of three consecutive months. The animal presented no abnormal
      reaction with respect to the controls, nor was any pathological
      change noted in the animals after they had been killed. An equal
      result was obtained in the rats treated with 0.2 cc per 100 grams.
      No toxic reaction was observed by administration of TSel to rats
      and mice by the oral route by means of a catheter in the dose of 1
      cc per day for a prolonged period of time and even after adding 1%
      of TSel to the feed of the same animals.<br>
      <br>
      On the basis of what has been described hereinabove, the compounds
      according to the invention are practically non-toxic. This is even
      more surprising if one considers that compounds of selenium are
      known to be toxic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Carcinogenic Activity</b><br>
      <br>
      Thirty male mice of 23-27 grams weight and 30 female mice weighing
      28-31 grams were fed for one year a feed in the form of pellets,
      each one of them contains 0.1 cc of TSel.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the period of treatment, no case of neoplastic
      condition was noted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pharmacological Properties</b><br>
      <br>
      The concept of anabolic-catabolic dualism and relative
      definitions, as described hereinbelow, is amply illustrated also
      from an experimental point of view, in the case of lower animals
      by E. Revici, Research in Physiopathology, Van Nostrand, Ed.,
      Princeton, 1961.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted, however, that the invention is not based on
      the correctness of the theoretical considerations discussed in the
      work by E. Revici.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds according to the present invention exhibit a marked
      catabolic effect, as shown by a series of tests. The
      administration of the substances by the oral route or parenteral
      route to rats, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits, induces a leukopenia
      below 6000 per cubic millimeter, with an eosinopenia, the value of
      which is below 60 per cubic millimeter, corresponding to a
      catabolic action. In addition, in the lower animals one notes an
      increase of potassium in the serum with a decrease of the same
      potassium in eritrocytes, always corresponding to a catabolic
      action.<br>
      <br>
      The substance TSel and the other compounds according to the
      present invention cause changes in the urine, which may be
      summarized as follows: lowering of surface tension to below 66
      dynes per centimeter; an increase in specific gravity to a point
      above 1016; lowering of pH to a point below 6, thus always
      exhibiting a catabolic action.<br>
      <br>
      By means of analyses of atomic absorption, one notes that selenium
      is uniformly divided in the organism and is reduced in drastic
      measure in the period of 48 hours following the administration,
      selenium itself being transported by the erythrocytes mainly and
      being eliminated through the feces and urine. If the substance
      TSel is administered to animals having tumors, the analyses of
      atomic absorption show that 75% of selenium is fixed on the tumors
      themselves. In addition, about the same amount of selenium is
      found again in tumors of animals after they have been killed, one
      or two weeks after administration.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found by the cytochemical analyses that selenium is
      present almost exclusively in the cytoplasm of cancerous cells.
      Histological studies have shown a substantial increase in pyknosis
      and cellular carrhiorexi of cancerous cells with necrotic zones.<br>
      <br>
      In the study of oxygen absorption by ascitic cells of mice
      suffering from cancer, and oxygen absorption by yeast, the
      compounds according to the present invention cause an increase in
      the absorption itself corresponding to a catabolic action. When
      administered orally or administered in rats by injection, the
      compounds according to the present invention, cause a change
      towards higher pH values in the scab of wounds one day old.
      Control animals have shown a pH between 7.62 and 7.64, while in
      other treated animals, the pH reaches 7.80 showing a substantial
      catabolic action. The study of the effect exerted by the products
      according to the present invention on the curve of recovery of an
      epidermic wound in mice and in rats shows also a substantial
      catabolic action, which is manifested by the substantial increase
      in peaks and by the prolonged period of recovery.<br>
      <br>
      The oral administration of the compounds according to the present
      invention, in selected mice of FC1 origin, which in the controls
      exhibit 45% spontaneous cancer during one year of observation, has
      shown a reduction of spontaneous cancer to about 8%.<br>
      <br>
      In another group of experiments, the oral administration of TSel
      for one year, in the dose of 0.2 cc per "pellet" of Purina feed,
      has been capable of achieving a reduction in the incidence of
      spontaneous cancer from 40.6% in the controls to 3.3%.<br>
      <br>
      The administration to mice and rats which had undergone a
      transplant of various tumors has shown a substantial decrease in
      the percentage of positive results from 100% in the controls to an
      average of 4% in the treated animals. The administration to
      animals having transplanted tumors has induced constantly the
      reduction in growth, and in the case of intramuscular transplant,
      it has caused the disappearance of tumors administered with
      compounds to an extent more than 60%.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, the results obtained in mice in which ascitic
      cancerous Ehrlich cells had been transplanted, by the
      intramuscular route are reported hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      The animals were treated for six days with an injection of TSel in
      the dosage indicated hereinbelow.<br>

      ingested sodium chloride and, more particularly, relates to a
      composition or mixture including sodium chloride and a magnesium
      compound containing bivalent negative sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has become apparent in recent years that the ingestion of
      sodium chloride, especially at the higher levels to which humans
      have become accustomed, has deleterious effects, mainly related to
      the cardiovascular system, e.g., high blood pressure and
      arteriosclerosis, but also encourages growth of tumors. Efforts to
      restrict the ingestion of salt by eating low or unsalted food or
      substituting condiments has not been very successful.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A study of the biological activity of compounds has shown that
      they include either destructive-catabolic or constructive-anabolic
      actions in the human body. The manifestations of an abnormal
      condition, as symptoms, signs, pathology analyses and response to
      therapy are related to this dualism. Hypertension,
      arteriosclerosis and the growth of tumors are recognized as
      typical constructive anabolic manifestations. On the other hand, I
      have shown that the action of compounds upon the body has either
      an anabolic or a catabolic action. Thus, compounds can be
      classified as anabolic or catabolic by a series of tests.<br>
      <br>
      By tests, such as of the effect on the second day wound crust pH,
      or on the curve of the healing of a wound, or on the bloor
      eosinophile leukocytes and potassium, or on the urine pH, surface
      tension, specific gravity and chloride excretion, compounds can be
      established as either anabolic constructive or catabolic
      destructive.<br>
      <br>
      Through the study from this point of view of the biological
      actions of the elements, I have shown that the members of the
      different series (vertical grouping) of the periodic table have
      either anabolic or catabolic actions. The IA series, to which the
      sodium belongs, has anabolic actions. The same for the IIIA, VA
      and VIIA, to which the chloride element belongs. Sodium chloride
      consequently produces high anabolic effects. Oppositely, I have
      shown that the series IIA, IVA and VIA have antagonistic catabolic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      I have further found that the elements of the same period
      (horizontal grouping) act at the same level of the body
      organization, such as subnuclear, nuclear, cellular, metazoic or
      systemic, and that the sodium and the chloride act at the same
      metazoic level (tissues and organs). The biological effect of
      sodium chloride is thus a strong anabolic action at the metazoic
      level. This explains the noxious action upon the blood pressure
      and arteries, leading to the anabolic-constructive
      arteriosclerosis.<br>
      <br>
      Following the same systematization of the elements acting at the
      same metazoic level as the sodium and chloride but having an
      opposite catabolic action, it appeared that the use of one or more
      of the catabolic metazoic elements would produce the opposite
      action of this biological effect of the sodium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      This was shown to be true experimentally. Magnesium was seen to be
      opposite biologically to sodium, while the sulfur biologically
      opposite chlorine. In the case of sulfur, it was found that the
      bivalent negative was more active than the tetra- and hexa-valent
      positive.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these primary considerations, compounds having magnesium
      and sulfur were used, in order to show this antagonism as set
      forth in the following experiments.<br>
      <br>
      The bilateral adrenalectomy in young rats, of below 150 g, was
      seen to have almost 100% mortality. The administration of 1%
      solutions of sodium chloride as drinking water was seen to protect
      the adrenalectomized animals and, if administered for a sufficient
      length of time, to prevent the death. The administration together
      with the sodium chloride of magnesium sulfate, the last in
      subcutaneous repeated injections of 0.5 ml of a 10% solution for
      100 g of animal or orally as 1% in drinking water, was seen to be
      antagonistic to the action of the sodium chloride. In the
      adrenalectomized animals treated with sodium chloride and
      magnesium sulfate the mortality was over 80% instead of almost
      zero for the adrenalectomized animals receiving only the sodium
      chloride. The same for the older animals, to which the
      administration of magnesium sulfate (1% in drinking water) was
      seen to increase the mortality from 20% in controls to 75% in the
      animals receiving the magnesium sulfate. The use of the magnesium
      thiosulfate was still more effective than the magnesium sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between sodium chloride, magnesium sulfates and
      arteriosclerosis was seen in the following experiments.<br>
      <br>
      New Zealand rabbits were given 2 grams of cholesterol a day,
      orally, together with their food. Sacrificed after one month, they
      showed atheromatous lesions of the aorta. The animals sacrificed
      after only two weeks of receiving the cholesterol showed only few
      minimal lesions or none at all. The addition of sodium chloride
      (3% to the drinking water) to the animals receiving 2 g of
      cholesterol daily was seen to induce manifest aorta lesions and
      this after only two weeks of treatment with cholesterol.<br>
      <br>
      The administration of magnesium thiosulfate at 3%, together with
      the 3% sodium chloride in the drinking water, was seen to prevent
      the appearance of the aorta lesions, not only after two weeks as
      in the controls with NaCl alone, but even after one month.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, antagonism exists between magnesium and sodium
      which counteracts the biological action of sodium and that the
      same antagonism exists between the chlorine and sulfur, especially
      in the bivalent negative state.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus possible to overcome the adverse effects of sodium
      chloride by adding various magnesium compounds, such as magnesium
      oxide or magnesium acetylsalicylate and the sulfur compounds
      separately. Various sulfur compounds or even colloidal sulfur can
      be used for this purpose. The ingestation of colloidal sulfur has
      been found to produce sulfides in the intestines of animals. The
      bond of magnesium to catabolic sulfur enhances this antisodium
      action. It has been found that the best results are obtained by
      utilizing a magnesium compound containing bivalent negative sulfur
      and especially magnesium thiosulfate.<br>
      <br>
      The composition is prepared by merely mixing sodium chloride with
      magnesium thiosulfate, preferably previously heated around 170 DEG
      C. in order to eliminate or reduce its hydrated water. The
      crystals of magnesium thiosulfate are preferably ground to a fine
      powder before mixing with sodium chloride. The sodium chloride
      crystals can also be ground to a fine powder if desired. In this
      manner the taste of magnesium thiosulfate in the composition is
      substantially reduced. The amount of magnesium thiosulfate should
      be at least about 1% by weight of the total composition in order
      to subsequently antagonize the adverse effects of sodium chloride.
      Amounts as high as 10% by weight of magnesium thiosulfate can be
      employed without substantially affecting the taste of the sodium
      chloride. Amounts as high as 25% by weight could be used where
      taste is not a factor.<br>
      <br>
      Other catabolic agents, of a lower organizational level of the
      cells, such as Ca, Sc, V, Mn, Co, Cu, Ge and Se may be added
      together with the magnesium and sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      Other antianabolic agents, such as vitamins A, D, B6 and B12,
      fatty acids, aldehydes, and the special group of agents having a
      twin formation (2 atoms with the same electrical charge bound
      together) can also be added to the magnesium-sulfur agents if
      desired.<br>

      A method of inactivating enveloped virus comprises contacting said
      virus with a virucidally effective amount of a C20-24 linear
      polyunsaturated acid, aldehyde or primary alcohol having 5-7
      double bonds, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said acid, or
      a mixture thereof. Topical administration of the virucide is
      preferred and is effective in treating lesions associated with
      herpes infections. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the
      present method are provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to virucides and in particular to a method
      of inactivating enveloped virus. In a composition of matter
      aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for
      use in the present method.<br>
      <br>
      Viral infections have in the past been largely resistant to
      antibiotic therapy. In particular, herpes infections have proven
      to be especially refractory. Herpes virus belongs to the class
      known as 'enveloped virus", by which is meant those DNA or RNA
      virus having a lipoprotein envelope. Normally, the virus envelope
      is derived from host membrane components under the direction of
      viral protein. The class of enveloped virus includes herpes virus,
      e.g., herpes simplex 1 and 2; myxovirus, e.g., influenza virus;
      paramyxovirus, e.g., virus responsible for measles and mumps, and
      respiratory syncitial virus responsible for croup; corona virus,
      which is also implicated in the common cold; and toga virus, e.g.,
      rubella virus and virus responsible for encephalitis and
      hemorrhagic fever.<br>
      <br>
      Many compounds have antiviral or virustatic activity, i.e., they
      inhibit the spread of viral infection by inhibiting the
      replication of virus particles. However, they do not inactivate
      the virus. Acyclovir, 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, an
      antiviral drug which has recently been cleared by the FDA for use
      in treating herpes infections in humans, is a virustatic agent,
      but not a virucide.<br>
      <br>
      Recent research has shown that certain lipophilic compounds
      inhibit replication of some enveloped virus in vitro. Sands,
      Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 12, 523-528 (1977),
      discloses that various fatty acids can inhibit viral replication
      in bacteriophage, and that at least two modes of fatty acid
      inhibition can be involved. The first mode involves inactivation
      of the virus, i.e., virucidal activity. Oleic acid, a
      monounsaturated C18 fatty acid, was the most effective fatty acid
      tested for this property, but a C18 acid having two double bonds
      was essentially inactive. The second method is inhibition of
      replication, without killing the virus, i.e., anti-viral or
      virustatic activity. This phenomenon is related to the stage in
      the infectious cycle in which the fatty acid is added.<br>
      <br>
      Reinhardt et al., J. Virology, 25, 479-485 (1978) disclose that
      unsaturated fatty acids can inhibit the viral replication of PR4
      bacteriophage in vitro. The most effective acids were oleic acid
      and palmitoleic acid. Arachidonic acid (C20 tetraene) was
      moderately effective, but less effective than linolenic acid (C18
      triene).<br>
      <br>
      Kabara et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 2, 23-28
      (1972) disclose that certain fatty acids inhibit the growth of
      gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, but no virus
      species were tested. Some saturated fatty acids had antibacterial
      activity, mono-unsaturated acids were more effective and dienoic
      acids were even more active, for C18 fatty acids. However,
      arachidonic acid was not inhibitory at the concentrations tested.<br>
      <br>
      Sands et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 15, 67-73
      (1979) disclose antiviral activity in vitro of C14-20 unsaturated
      alcohols having 1-4 double bonds, the most active being
      gamma-linolenyl alcohol (6,9,12-octadecatrien-1-ol), while a C20
      tetraenyl alcohol had low activity. Lower antiviral activity in
      vitro was disclosed for saturated alcohols by Snipes et al.,
      Ibid., 11, 98-104 (1977); and Snipes et al., Symp. Pharm. Effects
      Lipids (AOCS Monograph No. 5), 63-74 (1978).<br>
      <br>
      A need continues to exist for a virucidal agent which is active
      against enveloped virus and which has very low toxicity,
      especially one that is a potent topical virucide against herpes
      virus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      One object of the present invention is to provide a method for
      inactivating enveloped virus using an agent of low human
      cytotoxicity.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a topical
      virucidal agent which is effective to prevent and/or reduce
      lesions which accompany herpes infections in animals and humans.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide a
      pharmaceutical composition for use in the foregoing methods.<br>
      <br>
      Upon further study of the specification and appended claims,
      further objects and advantages of this invention will become
      apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In a method aspect, the present invention provides a method of
      inactivating enveloped virus, which comprises contacting the situs
      of said virus or the virus itself with a virucidally effective
      amount of a C20-24 linear polyunsaturated acid, aldehyde or
      primary alcohol having 5-7 double bonds, a pharmaceutically
      acceptable salt of said acid, or a mixture thereof.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred method of use aspect, the present invention
      provides a method of treating lesions associated with a herpes
      infection in an animal or human subject, which comprises applying
      to the inflamed area an amount of the foregoing virucidal agent
      effective for reducing or arresting said lesions.<br>
      <br>
      In a composition of matter aspect, the present invention provides
      a pharmaceutical composition comprising a virucidally effective
      amount of the foregoing virucidal agent, and a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier. Preferred such compositions suitable for
      topical application are also provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The C20-24 linear polyunsaturated acids suitable for use in the
      present method and composition include eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA), eicosahexaenoic acid, eicosaheptaenoic acid,
      heneicosapentaneoic acid, heneicosahexaenoic acid,
      heneicosaheptaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA), docosaheptaenoic acid, tricosapentaenoic acid,
      tricosahexaenoic acid, tricosaheptaenoic acid, tetracosapentaenoic
      acid, tetracosahexaenoic acid, tetracosaheptaenoic acid and
      mixtures thereof. Preferred acids are EPA, DHA and mixtures
      thereof, including both non-conjugated and conjugated double bond
      isomers. Especially preferred are 5,8,11,14,17-EPA and
      4,7,10,13,16,19-DHA and mixtures thereof. It will be appreciated
      that the foregoing polyunsaturated acids can exist in a variety of
      geometric isomers, all of which are included in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The polyunsaturated acids may be employed as pure compounds or
      mixtures of pure compounds, or they may be employed as
      concentrates derived from natural vegetable and/or animal sources.
      Important natural sources of the polyunsaturated acids suitable
      for use in the invention are fish liver oils and concentrates
      and/or extracts thereof. It is known that EPA and DHA are present
      in significant quantities in oils such as cod liver oil, halibut
      liver oil, tuna liver oil and the like. Saponification and/or
      solvent extraction of fish liver oils can increase the percentage
      of free polyunsaturated fatty acids available therefrom by
      subsequent concentration and/or further extraction.<br>
      <br>
      The C20-24 linear polyunsaturated acids which are not available
      from natural sources may be synthesized by conventional techniques
      for producing long-chain polyolefins having either cis or trans
      double bonds. Such olefin syntheses are disclosed generally in the
      chapters on olefin synthesis in Harrison et al., "Compendium of
      Organic Synthetic Methods" (Wiley 1971); and Carruthers, "Some
      Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis" (Cambridge 1971); and with
      respect to the closely related carotene systems, in Anand et al.,
      "Art in Organic Synthesis" (Holden-Day 1970), the foregoing being
      illustrative and not inclusive of all such general references. The
      carboxyl group can be introduced early, as a protected, e.g.,
      esterified, function, or at the end of the synthetic pathway, by
      conventional means, as illustrated in the foregoing references.
      The longer chain acids may also be obtained by homologation of
      acids having fewer atoms in the carbon chain, by conventional
      reaction sequences, e.g., Arndt-Eistert homologation, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      The various geometric and position isomers of the polyunsaturated
      acids and/or the alcohols and aldehydes related thereto may be
      obtained by one or more conventional separation techniques well
      known in the art, e.g., column chromatography, thin layer
      chromatography, vapor phase chromatography, high performance
      liquid chromatography, fractional crystallization, and the like.
      Partial separations, e.g., solvent extraction, molecular
      distillation, for the purpose of producing more highly active
      virucidal fractions are also included within the separation
      methods envisioned for the production of virucidal agents for use
      in the present method and composition.<br>
      <br>
      The polyunsaturated acids of the invention may be administered in
      the form of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts with
      inorganic or organic bases, where the salts possess comparable
      and/or otherwise advantageous virucidal activity and which are
      otherwise physiologically compatible. Suitable inorganic bases to
      form these salts include, e.g., the hydroxides, carbonates,
      bicarbonates or alkoxides of the alkali metals or alkaline earth
      metals, e.g., sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like.
      Suitable organic bases include the following amines; lower mono-,
      di-, and trialkylamines, the alkyl radicals of which contain up to
      three carbon atoms, e.g., methylamine, dimethylamine,
      trimethylamine, ethylamine, di- and triethylamine,
      N-methyl-N-ethylamine, and the like; mono-, di- and
      trialkanolamines, the alkano radicals of which contain up to three
      carbon atoms, e.g., mono-, di- and triethanolamine,
      alkylene-diamines which contain up to six carbon atoms, e.g.,
      hexamethylenediamine; phenylalkylamines, e.g., benzylamine,
      phenylethylamine and N-methylphenylethylamine; cyclic saturated or
      unsaturated bases containing up to six carbon atoms, e.g.,
      pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, piperazine and their N-alkyl
      and N-hydroxyalkyl derivatives, e.g., N-methylmorpholine and
      N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidine, as well as pyridine.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, there may be mentioned the corresponding quaternary
      salts, e.g., the tetraalkyl, e.g., tetramethyl, alkylalkanol,
      e.g., methyltrimethanol and trimethylmonoethanol, and cyclic
      ammonium salts, e.g., the N-methylpyridinium,
      N-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)morpholinium, N,N-dimethylmorpholinium,
      N-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)morpholinium, N,N-dimethylpiperidinium
      salts, which are characterized by having good water-solubility. In
      principle, however, there can be used all the ammonium salts which
      are physiologically compatible.<br>
      <br>
      The transformations to the salts can be carried out by a variety
      of methods known in the art. For example, in the case of the
      inorganic salts, it is preferred to dissolve the acid in water
      containing at least one equivalent amount of a hydroxide,
      carbonate, or bicarbonate corresponding to the inorganic salt
      desired. Advantageously, the reaction is performed in a
      water-miscible, inert organic solent for example, methanol,
      ethanol, dioxane, and the like in the presence of water. For
      example, such use of sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium
      bicarbonate gives a solution of the sodium salt. Evaporation of
      the solution or addition of a water-miscible solvent of a more
      moderate polarity, e.g., a lower alkanol, e.g., butanol, or a
      lower alkanone, e.g., ethyl methyl ketone, gives the solid
      inorganic salt if that form is desired.<br>
      <br>
      To produce an amine salt, the acid is dissolved in a suitable
      solvent of either moderate or lower polarity, for example,
      ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and benzene. At
      least an equivalent amount of the amine corresponding to the
      desired cation is then added to that solution. If the resulting
      salt does not precipitate, it can usually be obtained in solid
      form by addition of a miscible diluent of low polarity, for
      example, benzene or petroleum ether, or by evaporation. If the
      amine is relatively volatile, any excess can easily be removed by
      evaporation. It is preferred to use substantially equivalent
      amounts of the less volatile amines.<br>
      <br>
      Salts wherein the cation is quaternary ammonium are produced by
      mixing the acid with an equivalent amount of the corresponding
      quaternary ammonium hydroxide in water solution, followed by
      evaporation of the water.<br>
      <br>
      The C20-24 aldehydes and primary alcohols suitable for use in the
      method and composition of the invention correspond to the acids
      set forth above, except that the carboxyl group of the acids is
      replaced by a formyl group or a hydroxymethylene group,
      respectively. The aldehydes and alcohols similarly exist as
      various geometric isomers which are included in the scope of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The primary alcohols and aldehydes may be readily prepared, e.g.,
      by reduction of the corresponding acids, or by other conventional
      methods. Typically, an acid will be converted to, e.g., a methyl
      ester, and the ester will be reduced to the corresponding alcohol
      with a hydride reducing agent, e.g., LiAlH4. The ester, optionally
      a triglyceride, is converted to the corresponding aldehyde by the
      method of Gauglitz, Jr. et al., J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc., 37, 425
      (1960).<br>
      <br>
      Other conventional techniques for producing an aldehyde or alcohol
      having the same carbon chain length or having fewer or greater
      numbers of carbons in the chain are also well known to the art,
      and are also illustrated inter alia in the aforementioned Harrison
      et al. reference. The alcohols may be converted to halides,
      sulfonate esters and the like and used as intermediates for the
      production of higher homolog alcohols, aldehydes and acids, e.g.,
      by reaction with cyanide, followed by hydrolysis or hydride
      reduction, or by other conventional synthetic pathways. It may be
      convenient and/or advantageous to use mixtures of reactants and
      products from the foregoing synthetic pathways, without further
      separation, as virucidal agents.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing examples of virucidal compounds useful in the
      present invention are intended to be illustrative of the scope of
      the invention, but not limitative thereof, and the invention
      includes equivalents of the illustrated compounds that also
      achieve the disclosed virucidal effects. Contemplated equivalents
      include mono or polysubstitution of moieties on the
      polyunsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and salts that will not
      interfere with their virucidal activity. Suitable such
      substituents would include halogen atoms, lower alkyl, lower
      alkoxy, hydroxy and the like, which can be introduced by
      conventional means.<br>
      <br>
      Isomerization of the double bonds in the polyunsaturated alcohols,
      aldehydes and acids of the invention may be effected by treatment
      with various basic catalysts. The aldehyde function should be
      protected in the form of a base-stable derivative, e.g., an
      acetal, or should be introduced after isomerization. Typically, a
      polyunsaturated acid, e.g., a pure acid or a mixture of acids from
      e.g., a natural marine oil, which usually has an arrangement of
      double bonds in allylic relation to one another, is treated with a
      concentrated solution of alkali and heated to promote double bond
      isomerization. Concentrated aqueous alkali, e.g., 50% KOH, or
      alkali metal alkoxides in polar solvents, are effective for
      isomerizing such allylic double bonds. The resultant acids contain
      double bonds which are partially or fully conjugated, i.e., they
      form alternating single and double bonds. Accordingly, the
      progress of the isomerization reaction may be monitored with
      ultraviolet spectroscopy, which reveals the presence of conjugated
      double bond systems by the appearance of absorption peaks in the
      long wavelength end of the ultraviolet spectrum. Isomerization
      preferably is effected under an inert gas atmosphere to avoid
      oxidation of the polyene systems.<br>
      <br>
      The polyunsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and salts of the
      invention, in contrast to the majority of drugs on the market for
      use in treating viral infections, are unusual in that they have
      virucidal activity, i.e., they disrupt the virus particles
      themselves and render them inactive and permanently
      non-infectious. Is is especially noteworthy that the present
      compounds are potent topical virucides against enveloped virus,
      both in vitro and in vivo. They are especially effective for the
      treatment of lesions produced as a result of herpes virus
      infections, e.g., oral, genital, ocular and the like. In fact, the
      topical activity of at least the preferred species against herpes
      simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is at least comparable to, and in
      some preparations superior to, that of Acyclovir (ACV).<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of the invention appear to prolong the survival time
      of animals infected with herpes virus, as well as being effective
      in reducing the formation of lesions. This suggests that the
      compounds of the invention have systemic activity.<br>
      <br>
      The virucidal properties of the compounds of the invention suggest
      their use to prevent the spread of infection by enveloped virus,
      e.g., by incorporating them in a hand cream or lotion for use by
      physicians both before and after the examination of patients with
      suspected virus infections. Furthermore, the compounds may be used
      in fluids used to kill virus on examining tables, instruments,
      gloves, towels and other surfaces which might come in contact with
      virus particles during the course of medical examinations. The low
      toxicity of the compounds of the invention further enhances their
      attractiveness for such prophylactic use.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence of the efficacy of the virucides of the invention in
      vitro has been obtained from bioassay using HSV-2, using a
      standard assay procedure. Serial dilutions of the compounds were
      tested for their ability to prevent plaque formation by a stock
      virus suspension. Reduction of plaque titer by test compounds as
      compared to mock treated controls was indicative of virucidal
      activity. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the test
      compounds, defined as the lowest concentration of the test
      compound capable of producing a 3-log (1,000 fold) reduction in
      virus titer, were determined. These represent the upper limit for
      the drug concentration, since dilutions were not carried beyond
      1:6400 and in some cases 1:12800. At a dilution of 1:12800, EPA
      had an MIC of 0.37 .mu.g/ml and DHA had an MIC of 0.47 .mu.g/ml. A
      purified fraction isolated from cod liver oil hydrolysate had an
      MIC of 0.42 .mu.g/ml, while a less highly purified hydrolysate
      fraction had an MIC of 1.00 .mu.g/ml. Cod liver oil itself was
      inactive.<br>
      <br>
      As evidence of the excellent topical activity of the virucides of
      the invention against enveloped virus, in vivo tests were carried
      out in mice and in guinea pigs. These tests were effected using
      substantially the same procedures as those reported by Pancic et
      al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 19, 470-476 (1981). In
      both studies, DHA was compared with ACV in a controlled study for
      effectiveness in reducing the occurrence and the severity of
      lesions resulting from infection by HSV-2 and in reducing
      mortality resulting from the virus infection. Surprisingly and
      unexpectedly, a low dose of DHA in an ointment base was highly
      effective in comparison with ACV in reducing lesions and in
      reducing mortality rates in mice. In fact, a low dose of DHA in
      the particular ointment vehicle used for test purposes appeared to
      have a higher activity than a high dose of the same material in
      the same vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular explanation of
      this phenomenon, it may be related to the action of fluid micelles
      formed by the fatty acid upon viral envelope proteins, which
      destabilize the viral membrane and inactivate the virus particle.
      It is known that lipid micelle formation and structure is
      sensitive to lipid concentration and to the composition of the
      suspending medium. Thus, it is possible that micelles with
      significantly different properties could be formed at higher
      concentrations or in different vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of this invention can be employed in mixture with
      conventional excipients, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic
      or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral or enteral
      application which do not deleteriously react with the active
      compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include
      but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohols, vegetable
      oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium
      stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty
      acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid
      esters, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the
      like. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if
      desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants,
      preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for
      influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring, flavoring and/or
      aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react
      with the active compounds.<br>
      <br>
      For parenteral application, particularly suitable are solutions,
      preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions,
      emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. Ampoules are
      convenient unit dosages.<br>
      <br>
      For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets,
      dragees, or capsules having talc and/or a carbohydrate carrier or
      binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and/or
      corn starch and/or wheat starch and/or potato starch. A syrup,
      elixir or the like can be used wherein a sweetened vehicle is
      employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated
      including those wherein the active compound is protected with
      differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation,
      multiple coatings, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred mode of application of the virucides of the invention
      is as a topical agent, either in nonsprayable or sprayable form.
      Non-sprayable forms can be semi-solid or solid forms comprising a
      carrier indigenous to topical application and having a dynamic
      viscosity preferably greater than that of water. Suitable
      formulations include, but are not limited to, solutions,
      suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments,
      salves and the like. If desired, these may be sterilized or mixed
      with auxiliary agents, e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting
      agents, buffers or salts for influencing osmotic pressure and the
      like. Preferred vehicles for non-sprayable topical preparations
      include ointment bases, e.g., polyethylene glycol-1000 (PEG-1000);
      conventional ophthalmic vehicles; creams, e.g., HEB cream; and
      gels, e.g., K-Y gel; as well as petroleum jelly and the like.
      These topical preparations may also contain emollients, perfumes
      and/or pigments to enhance their acceptability for various usages.<br>
      <br>
      Also suitable for topical application are sprayable aerosol
      preparations wherein the virucidal compound, preferably in
      combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier material, is
      packaged in a squeeze bottle or in admixture with a pressurized
      volatile, normally gaseous propellant, e.g., a
      Freon(Chlorofluorocarbon) or environmentally acceptable volatile
      propellant. Such compositions can be used for application to
      environmental surfaces, e.g., examining tables, toilet seats and
      the like, and/or for application to the skin or to mucous
      membranes. The aerosol or spray preparations can contain solvents,
      buffers, surfactants, perfumes and/or antioxidants in addition to
      the virucidal compounds of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      For the preferred topical applications, especially for treatment
      of humans and animals suffering from the symptoms of herpes virus
      infections, it is preferred to use the polyunsaturated acids of
      the invention, although the unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes are
      also suitable. Salts of the acids appear to be less effective for
      topical applications. It will be appreciated that salts can be
      used to prepare compositions for topical applications, in
      combination with suitable buffers and/or acids to lower the pH of
      the final preparation.<br>
      <br>
      The virucides of the invention are generally administered to
      animals, especially mammals, in virucidally effective amounts, and
      in dosage unit form. The dose can be administered singly or as
      divided dosages throughout the day.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred topical form of administration used to effect the
      present method, application of a virucidally effective amount of a
      virucide according to the invention to an infected area, e.g.,
      skin surfaces, mucous membranes, eyes, of an animal or human
      subject suffering from a viral infection, especially a herpes
      infection, will generally range from about 0.001 mg to about 1 g
      per application, depending upon the area to be treated, the
      severity of the symptoms and the nature of the virucidal agent and
      the topical vehicle employed. Preferably, dosages in the range
      0.01-100 mg will be used. A preferred topical preparation is an
      ointment wherein about 0.01-50 mg of virucide is used per cc of
      ointment base, the latter being preferably PEG-1000, and more
      preferably an ointment containing about 0.1-10 mg/cc of a C20-24
      acid according to the invention, preferably DHA and/or EPA, in
      PEG-1000.<br>
      <br>
      In preparing virucidal compositions according to the present
      invention, particularly topical preparations using polyunsaturated
      acids, it is preferable to use acids which are as pure as possible
      and/or which are substantially free, or have at least a
      significantly reduced content, of esters, e.g., triglycerides.
      Thus, where a fish liver oil is used as the source of the
      polyunsaturated acids, reduction of the natural triglyceride
      content, e.g., by saponification of the oil and recovery of the
      saponified acids fraction, will be advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, molecular distillation, solvent extraction,
      fractional crystallization, liquid chromatography and the like are
      advantageously used to produce more concentrated and more active
      fractions. Combinations of the foregoing techniques can be used to
      achieve still more virucidally effective compositions.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutical preparations wherein substantially pure C20-24
      polyunsaturated acids having 5-7 double bonds are used are
      preferred, especially those which are substantially free of
      esters, e.g., triglycerides, and most preferably those having
      substantially pure EPA and/or DHA as substantially the only fatty
      acids therein. Where a concentrate of polyunsaturated acids is
      used to prepare the pharmaceutical composition, the content of
      C20-24 fatty acids having 5-7 double bonds is advantageously at
      least about 20% by weight, 30% being preferred, and 40%, 50%, 60%,
      70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 99% being even more preferable the higher
      the percentage of the virucides. Conversely, the lower the
      triglyceride content, e.g., less than 50%, preferably less than
      40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% and most preferably less than 1%, the more
      preferred is the composition.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that formulations and dosages may be varied
      and may fall outside of the preferred ranges for various uses,
      e.g., applications to environmental surfaces for prophylactic use
      and/or veterinary and disinfectant applications.<br>
      <br>
      Aerosols for topical medicinal applications will have similar
      concentrations and dosages to the creams, lotions and ointments
      described above, but may have higher or lower concentrations for
      other applications, e.g., prophylactic and/or disinfectant use,
      veterinary applications and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Dosage levels for enteral and/or parenteral administration to
      achieve systemic activity will generally fall in the range of
      0.001 mg-5 g daily, preferably in solid or liquid unit dosages of
      about 0.01 mg-1 g of virucide together with about 0.1-10 g of a
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The precise dosages and
      frequencies of administration will vary in relation to the
      severity of the clinical symptoms and the nature of the virucide
      and of the virus species being treated, as well as the nature and
      size of the subject, in a manner well known to veterinary and
      clinical practitioners.<br>
      <br>
      Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in
      the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present
      invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred specific
      embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely
      illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the
      disclosure in any way whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of cod Liver Oil Hydrolysate</b><br>
      <br>
      A 100 ml quantity of medicinal grade cod liver oil (CLO), obtained
      from Humco Laboratories, was combined with 100 ml of 10% aqueous
      sodium hydroxide and refluxed for two hours. After cooling, the
      mixture was acidified with 50% sulfuric acid. The acidified
      reaction mixture was extracted with ether and the ether layer was
      washed with water until the wash water was neutral. The ether
      extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the
      ether removed on a rotatory evaporator, to yield 87 ml of a yellow
      oil. The oil was then combined with an equal volume of 50%
      potassium hydroxide and heated at reflux for two hours. The
      resultant reaction mixture was acidified with 50% sulfuric acid
      and extracted three times with 250 ml portions of ether. The
      combined ether extracts were washed with water until the wash
      water was neutral. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
      filtering and removing the ether, 56.3 g of CLO hydrolysate (CLOH)
      was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      An ultraviolet spectrum of the product showed long wavelength
      absorption, indicating that at least partial conjugation of the
      double bonds had occurred. The yellow oil obtained prior to the
      50% KOH treatment, consisting mainly of unconjugated fatty acids,
      can also be used as a source of virucide according to the
      invention, either as such or after further purification, e.g., as
      shown in Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to obtain a virucidally active concentrate by
      extracting a fish liver oil, e.g., cod liver oil, with an alcohol,
      e.g., methanol, and evaporating the alcohol, and optionally
      saponifying as above and recovering the resultant hydrolysate,
      which can be further purified, e.g., as in Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Fractionation of Cod Liver Oil Hydrolysate</b><br>
      <br>
      A 1 g sample of the CLOH prepared in Example 1, dissolved in 1 ml
      of acetonitrile, was chromatographed using reverse phase high
      performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a Chrompack
      Lichrosorb 10 RP 18 column, 25 cm in length, with 100%
      acetonitrile mobile phase. The collected fractions were stripped
      of acetronitrile and weighed. A fraction having a retention time
      of 2.3 min. and weighing 78.7 mg was produced, and labelled
      CLOH-2.3.<br>
      <br>
      A portion of the CLOH-2.3 material weighing 63.0 mg was dissolved
      in 400 .mu.l of mobile phase and rechromatographed using 90%
      acetonitrile/10% water. Three major peaks resulted, which were
      separately collected and the solvent stripped. The amounts
      obtained after vacuum stripping were: Peak 1, 7.9 mg; Peak 2, 6.2
      mg; and Peak 3, 16.0 mg. The peaks were labelled CLOH-2.3-1,
      CLOH-2.3-2 and CLOH-2.3-3, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In a separate experiment, it was found that extraction of CLO with
      methanol, followed by evaporation of the methanol and further
      extraction of the residual extract with acetonitrile produced a
      solution which, upon RP-HPLC chromatography, was shown to contain
      major quantities of materials having the same retention times as
      the major components in the CLOH-2.3 material. By judicious
      isolation of RP-HPLC fractions, it was possible to produce a
      concentrate having very similar chromatographic behavior on
      RP-HPLC to the CLOH-2.3 material, although the yield of such
      fractions was substantially lower than the yield of concentrate
      from fractionation of CLOH.<br>
      <br>
      In a further experiment, enrichment of the CLOH material in the
      CLOH-2.3 fraction components was effected by extracting a 37.4 g
      sample of CLOH with three equal volumes of about 15 ml each of
      acetonitrile. The combined extracts were stripped and weighed,
      producing 15.1 g of residue, which was redissolved in acetonitrile
      to a concentration of 1 g/3 ml. RP-HPLC of this material using
      100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase showed that the major peak
      had a retention time of 2.3 minutes, and represented a
      sustantially greater percentage of the total material in the
      sample than was the case in the CLOH itself. Accordingly,
      repetitive injections of this material were made and an additional
      stock of the CLOH-2.3 fraction was prepared. Further fractionation
      of the CLOH-2.3 material using 90/10 acetonitrile/water was
      effected as described above, and material corresponding to
      CLOH-2.3-3 was collected and vacuum stripped.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>In Vitro Bioassays</b><br>
      <br>
      Assays were performed using herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Production of Virus Test Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      Cell Culture. Cell cultures used for the propagation and titration
      of HSV-2 were the human diploid lung embryonic line MRC-5 and the
      human malignant epitheloid cell line HEP-2 respectively. Stock
      monolayer cultures of both cell lines were propagated in
      Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DME) supplemented with 10%
      (V/V) calf serum. Spinner cultures for mass production of HEP-2
      cells were grown in Joklik's medium supplemented with 10% (V/V)
      calf serum and 1% (W/V) pluronic acid. Monolayer cultures of HEP-2
      cells for plaque or virucidal assay were seeded into 60 mm dishes
      in DME supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Stock
      cultures were maintained in antibiotic free medium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of HSV-2 Stock and Titration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2) strain 333 was obtained from
      Dr. John Hughes of the Dept. of Medical Microbiology, College of
      Medicine, The Ohio State University. Stocks of HSV-2 were prepared
      in the human diploid embryonic lung cell line, MRC-5. Confluent
      MRC-5 monolayer cultures in T-75 plastic flasks were washed one
      time with Hank's and Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) and infected
      with 0.5 ml of HSV-2, strain 333 stock. Virus was adsorbed for 1
      hour at 37 DEG C. Then the culture was refed with 15 ml of DME
      supplemented with 1% (V/V) calf serum. Virus was harvested 48
      hours later when cytopathology was complete. Cultures were frozen
      and thawed rapidly three times to release cell associated virus,
      clarified by centrifugation at 10,000.times.g for 15 minutes at 4
      DEG C., aliquoted into 5 ml lots and frozen at -70 DEG C. One lot
      was taken for virus titration.<br>
      <br>
      HSV-2 was titrated by plaque assay in HEP-2 cells under a
      semi-solid methyl cellulose overlay. Tenfold serial dilutions of
      virus were prepared in HBSS and 0.3 ml aliquots of each dilution
      inoculated onto triplicate HEP-2 cell monolayers in 60 mm plastic
      petri dishes. Adsorption of virus was for 1 hour at 37 DEG C.
      Plates were then overlayed with 5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of
      2.times.DME supplemented with 2% (V/V) calf serum and 3% (W/V)
      methyl cellulose to give a final 1.times.DME supplemented with 1%
      calf serum and 1.5% methylcellulose. Infected plates were
      incubated at 37 DEG C. in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere for 48
      hours. Virus plaques were visualized by staining with crystal
      violet and counted under a dissecting microscope. Virus titers
      were calculated from the plaque numbers by averaging the plaque
      count and multiplying by 3.3 (0.3 ml plates).<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Technique for Virus Assays</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following procedure was employed to assay virucidal activity
      in various test samples. Compounds were received as a solution in
      DMSO and were serially diluted in HBSS as described for each
      experiment. For the test, 1 ml of each dilution was mixed with 1
      ml of a stock virus suspension diluted to approximately
      9.times.10@3 plaque forming units (P.F.U.)/ml. This test mixture
      was incubated at 25 DEG C. for 30 minutes, then inoculated onto a
      cell culture (HEP-2) for plaque assay as described previously.
      Mock treated (virus plus HBSS) controls were included with each
      test. Any reduction of plaque titer by test compounds as compared
      to the mock treated control was indicative of virucidal activity.
      Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of test compounds were
      defined as the lowest concentration of a compound capable of
      producing a 3-log (1000-fold) reduction in virus titer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bioassay of CLOH and Fractionation Products</b><br>
      <br>
      Samples from RP-HPLC fractionation of the CLOH, produced according
      to Example 2, as well as purified samples of palmitic, myristic
      and oleic acids and Vitamin D2, were tested for HSV-2 bioactivity.
      The results of this bioassay are listed in Table 1. The CLOH-2.3
      sample was shown to have an MIC value at least as low as 2.45
      .mu.g/ml; the breakpoint was not reached at dilutions of 1:6400.
      MIC values are shown in Table 2. The CLOH-2.3-3 sample had an MIC
      of 2.5 .mu.g/ml. Pure oleic acid was not active in this assay, nor
      were palmitic and myristic acids and Vitamin D2.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral data indicated that the CLOH-2.3-3 material was likely to
      be a mixture of EPA and DHA. Accordingly, authentic samples of EPA
      and DHA were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company and their
      presence was confirmed as major components, together with
      impurities in the CLOH-2.3-3 fraction. Authentic EPA and DHA and
      their methyl esters were submitted for bioassay. The samples were
      prepared with DMSO/HBSS (50:50) to a concentration of 8 mg/ml and
      assayed at several dilutions. Results of the bioassay are shown in
      Table 3 and the MIC values for the samples are shown in Table 4.<br>

      The in vitro bioassays demonstrated that the polyunsaturated
      acids, exemplified by EPA and DHA, both in their unconjugated and
      at least partially conjugated forms, are potent and fast-acting
      virucides. Separate experiments showed that DHA inhibits more than
      98% of the virus within 30 seconds of contact, and better than
      99.99% of the virus within 30 minutes of contact.<br>
      <br>
      Comparable results are expected for in vitro activity of the
      polyunsaturated alcohols, aldehydes and acid salts of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>In Vivo Bioassays</b><br>
      <br>
      Using substantially the procedures of Pancic et al., loc. cit.,
      the topical activity of DHA, a representative and preferred
      virucide for use in the present method, was evaluated in mice and
      in guinea pigs. Both evaluations included comparative testing
      against ACV and the mouse tests included a comparison of two
      different vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mouse Bioassay</b><br>
      <br>
      The antiherpetic activity of DHA and ACV was compared using two
      evaluation criteria; (1) duration and severity of genital lesions,
      and (2) increased or decreased survival time.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental groups were:<br>
      A. HSV-2 infected DHA treated<br>
      (1) Two doses: 1 mg/ml Low and 10 mg/ml High<br>
      (2) Two vehicles per dose: ointment and soluble form of the drug<br>
      B. HSV-2 infected, Acyclovir treated<br>
      (1) One dose of the drug<br>
      (2) Two vehicles (as above)<br>
      C. HSV-2 infected (infected controls)<br>
      (1) Vehicle control (two vehicles)<br>
      (2) No treatment<br>
      D. Uninfected mice<br>
      (1) Vehicle alone<br>
      (2) Vehicles and drug (high dose only)<br>
      (3) Untreated<br>
      <br>
      This experimental approach provided an indication of whether or
      not DHA exhibited antiherpetic activity in vivo, as compared to a
      known active drug Acyclovir. Protocols and treatment regimens are
      shown below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Animals</b><br>
      <br>
      Female Swiss Webster mice were received from Charles River
      Breeding Laboratories, Inc. at 5 weeks of age and were held in
      quarantine for two weeks. Pooled sera from selected mice was
      tested for Pneumonia Virus of Mice, Mouse Hepatitis Virus, Sendai
      Virus, and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus. No significant
      titers were found.<br>
      <br>
      Mice were 7 weeks of age at the beginning of the experiment, were
      housed 5 per cage, and allowed food and water ad libitum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HSV-2 Stock Virus Preparation and Titration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      HSV-2 strain 333 passaged in MRC-5 cells was inoculated onto
      confluent HEP-2 monolayers and harvested 48 hours later when 100%
      of the cells exhibited cytopathology. The cells were disrupted by
      freezing and thawing three times and the supernatant clarified by
      centrifuging at 1000.times.g for 10 minutes and by centrifuging
      again at 8,000.times.g rpm for 10 minutes at 40 DEG C. Virus
      containing supernatant was aliquoted and frozen at -70 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The virus was titrated on confluent HEP-2 monolayers seeded from
      Spinner culture 24 hours earlier at 2.times.10@6 cells per 60 mm
      tissue culture dish. Serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus stock
      were prepared in HBSS and each dilution was inoculated in
      triplicate onto HEP2 cell monolayers and allowed to adsorb for 60
      minutes at 37 DEG C., 10% CO2. Following adsorption the plates
      were overlayed with a 3% methylcellulose overlay in Dulbecco's
      Modified Eagle's Medium +20% calf serum and incubated at 37 DEG
      C., 10% CO2 for 48 hours and subsequently stained with crystal
      violet. Plaques were counted with the aid of a microscope, and the
      titer of the stock virus preparation was 4.4.times.10@8 p.f.u./ml.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Virus Infection of Mice</b><br>
      <br>
      Pre-Treatment with 0.1N NaOH. 24 hours before inoculation with
      HSV-2 virus, mice were washed intravaginally with sterile 0.1N
      NaOH to irritate the vaginal tissue. 0.15 ml 0.1N NaOH was
      introduced intravaginally with a sterile eye dropper and the area
      flushed three times. Two hours prior to virus inoculation mice
      were swabbed intravaginally with 0.1N NaOH, using a sterile cotton
      swab.<br>
      <br>
      Virus Inoculation. An aliquot of HSV-2 suspension in HBSS was
      thawed quickly and diluted 1:10 in HBSS. 0.020 ml of the diluted
      virus suspension was introduced intravaginally using an Eppendorf
      pipet with separate, sterile Eppendorf pipet tips for each mouse.
      The inoculation was done in a biohazard hood. Each infected mouse
      received 1.times.10@7 p.f.u. of HSV-2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Drug Preparation</b><br>
      <br>
      Vehicles. A 70% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)--30% HBSS solution or
      polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG) served as carriers for the
      Acyclovir or DHA and were also administered alone, as controls.
      The DMSO-HBSS vehicle was selected based on the observed
      (visually) solubility of DHA in various DMSO-HBSS solutions. 1 mg
      DHA was soluble in 1 ml of 70% DMSO-30% HBSS.<br>
      <br>
      Acyclovir. A 5% weight/volume mixture of unionized Acyclovir or
      the sodium salt of Acyclovir was prepared in 70% DMSO-30% HBSS and
      in PEG 1000. The PEG 1000 was warmed to facilitate uniform
      suspension of the drugs. The use of the sodium salt of Acyclovir
      in either carrier required the addition of 1N HCL to neutralize
      the mixtures.<br>
      <br>
      4,7,10,13,16,19 Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). A weight/volume
      mixture of 1 mg DHA per ml carrier or 10 mg per ml carrier
      constitute the low and high doses of test drug prepared. The PEG
      1000 was warmed to facilitate mixing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Drug Administration and Animal Observations</b><br>
      <br>
      Control and infected mice were treated in a biohazard hood with
      carrier plus drug or carrier alone twice daily Monday through
      Friday and once daily Saturdays and Sundays. The treatment regimen
      was initiated three hours post HSV-2 intravaginal inoculation and
      was continued for 14 days thereafter. DMSO-HBSS alone or DMSO-HBSS
      plus drug was delivered at 0.15 to 0.2 ml per mouse, using
      separate, sterile eye droppers. PEG 1000 alone or PEG 1000 plus
      drug was warmed and delivered at approximately 0.15 ml per mouse,
      using separate, sterile swabs.<br>
      <br>
      Infected and control mice were allowed food and water ad libitum
      and were observed once daily for clinical signs of virus infection
      for 14-21 days following HSV-2 innoculation. Vaginal HSV-2
      infection was scored according to the following description. A
      score of 0 indicated no clinical signs of vaginal infection. A
      score of.±.indicated slight perivaginal redness. A score of 1
      indicated perivaginal redness and swelling of 1-2 mm. A score of 2
      indicated perivaginal redness and swelling of 2-3 mm. A score of 3
      indicated perivaginal and perianal redness and swelling of 3-4 mm.
      A score of 4 indicated perivaginal and perianal redness and
      swelling of 4 mm or more, with exudate.<br>
      <br>
      The results are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. It is seen that DHA
      showed effective virucidal activity against HSV-2, especially the
      low dose ointment preparation. The validity of this test procedure
      is shown by the fact that ACV was effective in minimizing the
      clinical signs of infection in either carrier vehicle and in
      achieving a survival rate of 100% in both groups within the
      observed 14 day period. It should also be noted that neither
      carrier or any of the preparations showed signs of toxicity in the
      tested animals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Guinea Pig Bioassay</b><br>
      <br>
      A blind comparative test was carried out on guinea pigs using
      coded substances labeled A through D. The testers were told only
      that one of the four substances was ACV, that the other three
      coded samples were the same material, in concentrations of 0.1,
      1.0 and 10 mg/ml, and that all four samples were formulated in a
      polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG-1000) vehicle. A separate sample of
      the PEG-1000 was also submitted to serve as a placebo for treating
      virus control animals. The materials and experimental protocol is
      shown below.<br>
      <br>
      Animals. Female Hartley strain albino guinea pigs weighing about
      450-500 g were used. The animals were quarantined 24 hr prior to
      use in this study, and maintained 5 to a 32".times.32".times.9"
      stainless steel cage on Wayne guinea pig diet and water ad
      libitum.<br>
      <br>
      Virus. Strain E194 of herpes virus type 2 was used. The virus was
      initially obtained from Dr. M. Fiala, Harbor General Hospital,
      (Torrance, CA), and an MA-104 culture pool was prepared and
      pretitered in guinea pigs. The virus was held at -90 DEG C. until
      used.<br>

      Drugs. The substances tested consisted of four bottles labelled
      "A", "B", "C", and "D" with no identifying key. The samples were:
      A, 0.1 mg/ml DHA (0.003 mmol/ml); B, 5% w/w ACV (0.22 mmol/ml); C,
      1 mg/ml DHA (0.03 mmol/ml); and D, 10 mg/ml DHA (0.3 mmol/mg).
      Each substance, at room temperature, had a hard wax consistency,
      so was warmed to 45 DEG C. in a water bath and gently mixed
      immediately prior to use in treatment. All were treated as
      light-sensitive compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental Protocol. The guinea pigs were infected by applying a
      virus-soaked swab intravaginally, with agitation, for 20 seconds.
      Toxicity control animals were similar pretreated using swabs
      soaked in sterile Puck's balanced salt solution. Treatment began
      20 hr later, with the compound or placebo applied topically
      intravaginally, perivaginally, and perianally using cotton swabs
      soaked in the respective substance. Treatment continued three
      times daily (8 a.m., noon, 4 p.m.) for 7 days. Ten infected
      animals were used for each coded substance, with twenty used for
      virus controls. Five sham-infected animals were concomitantly
      treated with each coded substance to serve as toxicity controls.
      Two guinea pigs were held separately to serve as normal untreated
      controls.<br>
      <br>
      Each animal was observed daily for survival for a total of 28
      days. On days 5 through 8 post-virus inoculation, the genital area
      was carefully examined and signs of irritation in the toxicity
      controls and lesion severity in injected animals was scored on a 0
      to 4 scale using the same scale as in the mouse bioassay. The
      results were scored as average daily lesion (ADL) scores for each
      group, and as mean vaginal lesion (MVL) scores, calculated as the
      mean of the ADL scores for days 5-8. The maximum mean score for
      the toxicity control animals was also determined.<br>
      <br>
      On day 6 prior to the 8 a.m. treatment, intravaginal and
      perivaginal areas of each infected guinea pig were uniformly
      swabbed with sterile cotton swabs. The swab for each animal was
      placed in 1.0 ml of sterile Eagles minimum essential medium and
      immediately frozen at -90 DEG C.; several days later all were
      thawed and each swab-containing sample vortexed for 15 seconds and
      then the sample was diluted through a series of 10-fold dilutions
      in sterile medium. Each dilution was assayed for virus in
      triplicate by adding 0.1 ml to an established monolayer of MA-104
      cells in 96-well disposable plastic microplates. The plates were
      sealed, incubated at 72 hr at 37 DEG C., and virus-induced
      cytopathic effect noted microscopically.<br>
      <br>
      Data Analysis. Increases in survivors were analyzed using chi
      squareanalysis with Yate's correction. Mean survival times (MST)
      of animals dying on or before day 29 were determined for each
      group, and evaluated using the t test. Titers of virus recovered
      from vaginal areas were expressed as 50% cell culture infectious
      dosages calculated using the Reed-Muench procedure, and titer
      decreases evaluated by t test.<br>
      <br>
      The results are summarized in Table 7. This experiment used a high
      level of virus to infect the animals, which was selected to induce
      eventual deaths in all of the infected animals. As a consequence,
      the total survival and mean survival time data were of
      considerably less significance than the effect on the severity of
      lesions and on the vaginal virus titer. In this experiment,
      neither ACV nor the lowest dosage of DHA were able to achieve a
      statistically significant reduction in lesion scores. Animals
      receiving the higher dosages of DHA of samples "C" and "D" had
      statistically significant reductions in lesion scores. Significant
      decreases in vaginal virus titer were seen in all the treated
      groups compared to the placebo treated group.<br>

      indicated for acupuncture for the painful site.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention:</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method and preparations for relieving
      pain and producing analgesia.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A great deal of research has been performed on the effect of
      histamine and related compounds, both in vivo and in vitro. The
      literature on this subject is so vast and conflicting that it is
      simply not practical to set forth any meaningful discussion on the
      subject. For example, Rosenthal et al. have reported in Am. J.
      Physiol. 155, 186- 90 (1948) that painful sensations are produced
      by the injection of histamine and in the Proc. Soc. Ecptl. Biol.
      Med. 74, 167- 70 (1950) that histamine introduced into the
      superficial layers of human skin causes an immediate as well as
      latent painful sensation. Jacob et al., Am. inst. Pasteur 81, 128-
      92 (1951), have reported that histamine diHCl given to rats
      subcutaneously or intraperitoneally for 6 to 30 days decreased
      their sensitivity to thermal induced pain, but which returned
      after cessation of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly a great deal of research has been performed with
      spreading agents such as the hyaluronidase enzyme. Hyaluronidase
      has been used alone and in combination with various drugs. The use
      of hyaluronidase and histamine has also been studied. For example,
      it has been reported by Seelich et al., Nature 168, 1125 (1951),
      that histamine does not neutralize heparin inhibitian of
      hyaluronidase and by Mathies et al., in Z. ges. exptel. Med. 133,
      32- 37 (1960), that the inhibitary action of phenylbutazone
      against hyaluronidase could be blocked by the simultaneous
      administration of an antihistaminic agent. A vast amount of
      additional publications exist, both with respect to histamine and
      hyaluronidase, none of which, to applicant's knowledge, disclose
      or teach the invention disclosed and claimed herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been found that administering histamine, its salts,
      compounds inducing histamine release, and dispersing agent such as
      hyaluronidase, or derivatives of histamine, having substantially
      the same pharmacological activity of histamine, directly to the
      painful area or at the sites indicated for acupuncture for that
      painful area, will relieve the pain and produce analgesia at the
      painful area.<br>
      <br>
      The term, histamine, is used herein in its generic sense, to
      include histamine, its non-toxic salts, compounds which induce
      histamine release in the body and histamine derivatives which
      produce a similar pharmacological activity within the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Histamine, its non-toxic salts, compounds inducing histamine
      release, and histamine derivatives having a similar
      pharmacological activity in the body are well known and their
      properties and pharmacological action well documented in the
      literature. All such compounds are operable so long as they are
      capable of depositing directly or indirectly a sufficient amount
      of histamine in combination with hyaluronidase to induce analgesia
      or relief of pain. The main object is to impart by injection to
      the painful area or at the acupuncture sites histamine or a
      related compound having the same pharmacological action as
      histamine in combination with hyaluronidase. Whether this is
      accomplished by use of histamine itself or its non-toxic salts, or
      in any other manner, is not material and is to be considered
      within the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersing or spreading factor can be a hyaluronidase of
      different origins, for example, from honey-bee venom, snake venom,
      etc. z-N-acetylglucosamidase has been found to be most efficient.
      These dispersing agents or factors and the methods by which they
      may be obtained are well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The pain relieving or analgesic compositions of this invention can
      be prepared for injection by placing the histamine compound and
      hyaluronidase in a suitable medium, such as water, saline
      solution, isotonic solution, etc., with proper sterilization, as
      will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The histamine compound and the hyaluronidase can be separately
      injected into the painful area or the acupuncture site for that
      painful area, but it is, of course, more convenient to combine the
      histamine compound and the hyaluronidase in a convenient solution.<br>
      <br>
      The concentration of the hyaluronidase enzyme, because of its
      variable activity, depending upon its source and other well known
      factors, is given in units as set by the National Formulary. The
      unit concentration is given on each package as units NF (TR) per
      volume of weight.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of histamine and/or hyaluronidase that can be injected
      will depend upon the particular patient being treated, the extent
      of the painful area, and the degree of pain. A sufficient amount
      of the histamine compound and the hyaluronidase should, of course,
      be injected to overcome the pain as will be apparent to any
      physician.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the histamine compound, the minimum amount has so
      far been determined to be about 0.01 mg., and with respect to the
      hyaluronidase about 10 units NF (TR), [hereinafter referred to as
      units or units per ml.]. Lower amounts could be used if conditions
      so indicate.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum amount of the histamine compound that can be used will
      depend somewhat upon the patient and his tolerance to "flushes"
      due to histamine reaction. Generally, amounts up to 0.5 mg. can be
      tolerated.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum amount of hyaluronidase that can be used will again
      depend upon the particular patient to be treated as well as the
      amount of histamine being injected. Investigation to date
      indicated that one would not require more than 50 units of
      hyalurondase.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the preparations of this invention can be prepared in such a
      manner so that the patient can receive between about 0.01 mg. and
      0.05 mg. of histamine and between about 10 and about 50 units of
      hyaluronidase. Experiments to date have shown that an injection of
      0.02 mg. of histamine and 10 units of hyaluronidase is
      advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions can be made up in varying concentrations and the
      total volume injected will, of course, depend upon the
      concentration of the solution. For example, if a solution is made
      up to contain 0.02 mg. of histamine per ml. and 10 units of
      hyaluronidase per ml., an injection of 1 ml. of this solution into
      the painful area or the acupuncture site should be sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions can be injected into the painful area by any means
      sufficient to relieve the pain, such as, subcataneously, or deeper
      into the tissues, periaticular, or even in the articulations, or
      in the sites used for acupuncture. Depending upon the area of
      pain, one injection may suffice or, if the painful area is larger,
      the composition or preparation may be injected into a plurality of
      places in the painful area, such as in Example 1, set forth below.
      Such a procedure is referred to herein as infiltration of the
      painful area. For example, in bursitis, at times, no burt can be
      located and in which case the entire painful area, the shoulder
      for example, may be infiltrated, injecting the total amount of
      desired histamine and hyaluronidase into the shoulder at a
      plurality of sites. In this case it may be, at times, desirable to
      have a more diluted solution, so that a larger area can be
      infiltrated and, at the same time, decrease the chance of any
      histamine reaction by the patient. Thus, the two main defects of
      the method, the missing of the painful spots and the "flushes" due
      to histaminic action, are controlled by this infiltration
      technique using more diluted solutions of histamine.<br>
      <br>
      As previously mentioned the method of this invention can also be
      practiced by injecting the preparations at the acupuncture sites
      for the areas in which it is desired to relieve pain or produce
      analgesia. These sites are well known and are described for
      example, in ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY, CURRENT CHINESE PRACTICE, by T.
      Tan, Y-C. Tan and Veith, Temple University Press, Philadelphia,
      1973.<br>
      <br>
      One advantage of this acupuncture technique is the fact that the
      results are not the function of the capacity of the individual to
      respond to the needle insertion with the liberation of histamine,
      and the use of this invention results in increased responses in
      the patient. Another advantage is the fact that the injection of
      the preparations, according to this invention, will affect the
      entire area or acupuncture site rather than just a single point,
      and the chances of having the necessary acupuncture site
      influenced is thus highly increased. The preparations of this
      invention can thus be used for the treatment of different
      conditions for which acupuncture is presently used, such as for
      the induction of anesthesia for surgical interventions.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been noted that together with the suppression of the
      pain, the evolution of lesions also appears to be influenced.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases where a patient is treated, as a precautionary
      measure, an anthistamine injection or adrenaline for injection was
      kept available in case of hypersensitivity to histamine. It is
      interesting to note, however, that in over 100 cases treated so
      far there was no need to use either the histaminic preparation or
      adrenaline, even in a case (Example 10) of the patient who had a
      history of servere histamininc reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples illustrate the practise of the invention:<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 60 year old male with severe pain and totally immobilized by a
      "frozen shoulder" due to bursitis. The condition had gotten
      progressively worse over the last two months and did not respond
      to various treatments. From a solution containing 0.2 mg. of
      histamine phosphate and 10 units of hyaluronidase per ml., 2 ml.
      divided in 4 injections were injected in the painful spots. The
      pain disappeared in less than 6 minutes, with recovery of
      movement. Seen after 2 weeks, the good effects were persistent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      A 58 year old female with severe arthritis pain in the coccidial
      region for several months. The pain could not be controlled by
      various treatments. From a solution containing 0.05 mg. of
      histamine phosphate and 10 units of hyaluronidase per ml. - 1 ml.
      was injected in the painful area. The pain disappeared in 4
      minutes and remained as such at an examination one month later.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><br>
      <br>
      A 50 year old male with pain due to a sciatica of the left leg,
      not responding to treatments for the last month. A total of 3 ml.
      of a preparation containing 0.05 mg. of histamine and 10 units of
      hyaluronidase per ml. was injected deep subcutaneously in 5
      different painful spots. The pain disappeared and remained as such
      after 2 months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><br>
      <br>
      A 38 year old female with lower abdominal pains due to an
      inflamation of both ovaries, lasting for months. (Three) 3 ml. of
      a solution containing 0.04 mg. per ml. of histamine phosphate and
      10 units of hyaluronidase per ml. were injected subcutaneously in
      the right side painful area. The pain disappeared in 5 minutes and
      did not reappear. The pain in the left side was not influenced and
      was treated 4 days later with the same dose. The patient remained
      without pain for at least 6 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><br>
      <br>
      A 70 year old female with pains in the left knee, and unable to
      localize the pain otherwise than the entire anterior area of the
      knee. A subcutaneous infiltration of this region with 10 ml. of a
      solution containing 0.01 mg. per ml. of histamine phosphate and 10
      units of hyaluronidase per ml. was followed by the disappearance
      and without recurrence of the pain after 12 days.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><br>
      <br>
      A 62 year old female with severe pain in the left sacroiliac
      articulation, persisting for months. A subcataneous injection of
      0.5 ml. of a solution containing 0.2 mg. per ml. of histamine and
      10 units of hyaluronidase per ml. at the painful area did not
      completely suppress the pain after 15 minutes. A same amount of
      the solution injected deep into the articulation fully controlled
      the pain, with the effect still persisting after 3 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><br>
      <br>
      A 50 year old male with a cancer of the spine, at the 10-12 D and
      1 D for which a decompressioin intervention was performed. The
      patient had very severe pain, on both sides of the lesion, only
      insufficiently controlled by opiates. From a solution containing
      0.2 mg. of histamine phosphate per ml. and 10 units of
      hyaluronidase per ml., several injections totalling 1.5 ml. were
      made only at the right side of the spine. The pain disappeared
      after 6 minutes and still did not reappear after one week, while
      the pain persisted unchanged in the left side of the spine. The
      same injection in left side had the same good effect.<br>
      <br>

      A 40 year old male with severe backache. The painful area was
      injected with 2 ml. of a 0.1 percent by weight solution of
      compound 48/80 and 10 units of hyaluronidase per ml. in a saline
      (sterilized by filtration). The pain was controlled in about 15
      minutes and the effect still persisted after one week.<br>

      <br>
      A 63 year old male with pains in the elbow after playing tennis.
      The pain persisted for weeks, in spite of treatment. A local
      infiltration of 7.5 ml. of a solution containing 0.02 mg. per ml.
      of histamine and 20 units of hyaluronidase per ml. was injected
      locally. The pain disappeared in 5 minutes. The patient did not

      a solution containing 0.1 mg. of histamine per ml. and 10 units of
      hyaluronidase was made. The pain was controlled in less than 10
      minutes. The patient remained without pain 6 weeks after the
      infiltration. The patient, who had a severe histaminic reaction
      because of a prior use of histamine for a gastric test, with
      headache, itching and vision troubles did not have any adverse
      reaction after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from the above examples, abdominal pain from ovary
      inflammation and gallbladder colics wee controlled by deep
      subcataneous injections in the painful areas. Even cancer pains
      responded well to the injections. Good results were obtained for
      different neuralgias, such as sciatica, tic douloureux, post Zonz
      Zoster neuralgia, with injections made "locus dolendi" (painful
      spots). The effects were good also in fractures and especially in
      residual pains after trauma. In general, with only very few
      exemptions, the results in more than 100 cases treated are
      exceptionally good, with not only the pain immediately controlled
      and with functional recovery, but with the results lasting for a
      long period of time, weeks or even months after the injections.
      The pain entirely disappears in less than about 15 minutes in most
      cases. In some cases the pain was felt after one or two days, but
      in these cases the pain was felt in areas other than those
      injected. No local numbness was noted.<br>

      The invention relates to a method of preventing or reducing the
      desire for smoking tobacco in humans by the internal
      administration of a composition produced by heating certain
      allylically unsaturated compounds sufficient to substantially
      increase the peroxide titer. The incorporation of sulfur in the
      composition during the heating has been found to be particularly
      advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Sulfurized polyunsaturated oils, or sulfurized oils, are disclosed
      in a book entitled RESEARCH IN PHYSIOPATHOLOGY AS BASIS OF GUIDED
      CHEMOTHERAPY by Emanual Revici, M.D., published by D. Van Nostrand
      Company, Inc., 1961, pages 334 and 335. A method of preparing
      sulfurized polyunsaturated oils referred to in the book as
      hydropersulfides is set forth in Note 7, page 711 of the book.
      This book does not disclose the use of the sulfurized compounds
      for preventing or reducing the desire for smoking tobacco claimed
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a method of eliminating or reducing the
      desire for smoking tobacco in humans by the internal
      administration of a composition produced by heating certain
      allylically unsaturated compounds in the presence of oxygen
      sufficient to substantially increase the peroxide titer. The
      incorporation of sulfur into the composition during or before the
      heating of the compositions has been found to be particularly
      advantageous and represents the most effective composition found
      to date. The compositions can be administered to the patient by
      the various accepted methods such as by injection or preferably
      orally in capsule form.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is desirable to have a method for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of the tobacco habit or addiction in a human by
      controlling the craving for tobacco and/or by controlling
      withdrawal symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to such methods of treatment involving the
      internal administration to a human host of a composition produced
      by oxidizing a fatty acid or fatty ester, for example, by bubbling
      air through the reaction mixture, structurally characterized by
      allylic unsaturation alone. The fatty acid or ester advantageously
      includes elemental sulfur and/or a conventional free radical
      initiator such as tertiarybutyl peroxide during the heating step.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring fatty ester such as an animal, vegetable, or fish oil.
      Sesame oil is a vegetable oil consisting largely of triglycerides
      and is the most advantageous composition found to date in the
      practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized preferably should contain a significant
      percentage of allylic moieties (to render the compositions useful
      according to the invention) indicated by the following partial
      structures<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --CH.dbd.CH--<br>
      <br>
      and/or<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2<br>
      <br>
      As indicated, the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated
      but the composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions, as the case may be, should be oxidized or
      heated in the presence of oxygen at a temperature in the range
      between about 110 DEG C. and about 150 DEG C. The oxygen can be
      obtained by merely heating the composition open to the atmosphere
      but preferably and advantageously, the source of oxygen is a gas
      such as air injected into a heated oil such as sesame oil. The
      injected air also serves as a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      As previously stated it is most advantageous to add elemental
      sulfur such as sublimed, precipitated, or washed sulfur to the
      compositions so that the sulfur is present with oxygen during at
      least a portion of the heating period and the sulfur incorporated
      into the composition. Additionally, a previous batch of the
      oxidized oil with or without sulfur or tert-butyl peroxide may
      advantageously be present during at least a portion of the heating
      period.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is added to the selected composition, for example,
      sesame oil, the temperature should be maintained at an upper limit
      within the range of about 120 DEG C. to about 130 DEG C., and
      preferably 125 DEG C. and 127 DEG C. These temperature limitations
      are based on a heating time of about one-half hour. The
      temperatures can be altered within limits depending on the time of
      heating. For example, the temperature can be 129 DEG-130 DEG C. if
      the time is shorter or even at 140 DEG C. for very short period of
      time. High temperatures for a prolonged period of time tend to
      degrade the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is not present during the heating period, the
      temperature should be maintained in the range between about 110
      DEG C. and about 150 DEG C., and preferably in the range between
      about 120 DEG C. and about 140 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The heat treatment is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. If sulfur is present, optimal results
      are obtained if the heat treatment is conducted for a period of
      time between about 30 minutes to about 1 hour. If a free radical
      initiator is present, or if a selected composition inherently
      contains a significant amount of initiator, the heat treatment
      period may be conducted for a relatively shorter period of time.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the composition which results from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known to the applicant.
      However, while applicant does not wish his invention limited by
      the following theory or fact, or mixed theory and fact as the case
      may be, certain evidence in available which indicates that an
      efficacious composition for the preventing or reducing the desire
      for tobacco in a human can be produced according to this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, it appears that a correlation exists between a
      composition useful for the subject purpose and its presumed
      peroxide or hydroperoxide content. By adhering to the process
      according to this invention, it has been found that efficacious
      compositions are produced which yield a significant peroxide titer
      when monitored by conventional iodometric analysis, the results
      being expressed, for example, in terms of micro-equivalents per
      gram. By significant peroxide titer is meant a value obtained
      which is greater than that which inherently may be present in the
      initial untreated compound.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of triglycerides which contain the allylic type
      unsaturation as described above, the resulting oxidized species is
      thought to be a hydroperoxide represented by the following partial
      structure ##STR1## as interpreted via UV spectroscopic analysis,
      inter alia.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the nature of the oxidized species, it appears amenable
      to monitoring by conventional iodometric analysis with or without
      the addition of sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      Although it appears that the activity of the composition is
      coincident with the presence of peroxides or hydroperoxides, the
      efficacious agent need not necessarily be directly derived from
      these classes. It may in fact be those species derived from
      radicals resulting from decomposition of compounds of, for
      example, triglyceride oils or sulfur including olefinic
      polymerization products and/or lower molecular weight
      decomposition products of the oils or additional products with
      sulfur such as sulfides, disulfides, hydropersulfides, etc.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to a preferred embodiment, it appears that the
      presence of elemental sulfur (approximately 1% by weight based on
      sesame seed oil) during the oxidation of sesame oil increase the
      amounts of oxidation products (conjugated hydroperoxides, diene,
      triene, unsaturated carbonyl) and that this increase appears
      optimal near 127 DEG C. as evidenced by UV spectroscopic analysis
      studies. In the absence of sulfur, it appears that the region near
      127 DEG C. is optimal for the production of oxidation products.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, it appears that the most effective
      compositions are those which have a relatively high peroxide
      titer. Comparisons of a preferred composition, namely sesame seed
      oil oxidized or treated with air in the presence of sulfur, with
      other triglycerides, or triglyceride containing oils, including
      corn oil, cottonseed oil, and triolein with regard to their
      respective peroxide titers indicates a trend in peroxide levels
      concordant with observed bioactivity in those having an addiction
      to tobacco. Such trend of bioactivity agrees in general with the
      results of a peroxide analysis involving the above-identified oils
      in their untreated state and when oxidized in the presence of
      elemental sulfur under similar conditions as follows:<br>

      **Within experimental error.<br>
      <br>
      It is thought that a lower bioactivity and a lower peroxide titer
      of cottonseed oil is due to the presence of natural anti-oxidants.
      The elimination of the anti-oxidants from oils such as corn and
      cottonseed oil or the use of the relatively pure allylically
      unsaturated compounds or mixtures thereof will produce a
      substantially increased peroxide titer when treated according to
      this invention. Triolein contains only oleic acid moieties which
      are characterized by the allylically unsaturated group
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 -- and hence is quite difficult to oxidize,*
      particularly when compared to the preferred sesame seed oil. A
      peroxide titer value of 35.7 meq/kg. has been attained for the
      sesame seed oil-sulfur-oxygen treated composition while sesame
      seed oil oxidized alone at 137 DEG C. yields a value of 63.3
      meq/kg. a peroxide titer value of 35.7 meq/kg
      [.DELTA.=(35.7-18.8)=16.91] has been attained for the sesame seed
      oil--sulfur--oxygen treated composition while sesame seed oil
      without sulfur oxidized at 137 DEG C. yields a value of 63.3
      meq/kg [.DELTA.=(63.3-10.2)=53.1].<br>
      <br>
      *J. Sci Fd. Agric. 1975, 26, 1353-1356.<br>
      <br>
      Generally a substantial increase in the peroxide titer value can
      be defined as .DELTA.3 to about .DELTA.100 in cases where sulfur
      is incorporated into the composition and an from about .DELTA.3 to
      about .DELTA.400 when the oil is oxidized alone, or in the absence
      of sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      The process used for determining the peroxide titer values
      discussed and reported herein are determined by placing a 2 gr.
      sample of the composition in a flask purged with nitrogen, and
      adding thereto 2 ml. of concentrated acetic acid and 0.5 grams of
      KI. The mixture is capped to exclude air and allowed to remain in
      the dark for 30 minutes to complete the reaction. The side walls
      are then wet down with a minimum of water and approximately 1-2 ml
      of a 2% starch added thereto. The solution is then immediately
      titrated to the end point with 0.007 normal Na2 S2 O2 solution.
      The end point is white when small amounts of peroxides are present
      and slightly when larger amounts are present.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions as prepared according to the process of this
      invention should be used soon after preparation as there is
      indication that the peroxide titer values and effectiveness of the
      compositions decrease upon aging.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred compositions according to this invention can be prepared
      by adding the sulfur to the oil, such as sesame oil, and heating
      the mixture with agitation at a temperature not to exceed about
      130 DEG C. It is preferable or advantageous to heat the mixture
      between 120 DEG and 127 DEG C. Heating the mixture above about 130
      DEG C. for a sufficient time causes a progressive color change in
      the mixture and otherwise appears to be detrimental. The
      temperatures given above relate to the use of sulfur with sesame
      oil. The ranges of temperatures which can be used to produce the
      compositions made according to this invention may vary with the
      particular oil being used, but generally a temperature of 120 DEG
      C., preferably 125 DEG C. to 127 DEG C., will be sufficient for
      most oils when sulfur is added.<br>
      <br>
      If the oil and sulfur is heated below about 90 DEG C., it is
      difficult to incorporate the sulfur into the oil by heating and
      stirring means. The best results have been obtained to date by
      maintaining the temperature used in forming the compositions over
      a prolonged period of time from about 30 minutes to one hour.
      Stirring aids in the reaction, and experiments to date indicate
      that a fairly violent stirring is advantageous. The introduction
      of air into the mixture during the heating is also very
      advantageous, particularly when the mixture is not subjected to
      prolonged heating and is the preferred method. The stirring can be
      accomplished with the introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, it is cooled. Sulfur crystals
      remaining in the bottom of the reaction vessel can easily be
      removed by filtration. The remaining fluid is ready for use after
      appropriate sterilization for injection or incorporated into
      capsules, such as gelatin, for oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of sulfur incorporated into the oil is advantageously
      between about 0.1% to 2.5% by weight, based on the oil. If higher
      amounts of sulfur are used they generally precipitate out. There
      appears to be no advantage to using higher amounts of sulfur in
      any event since the ultimate dosage given to the patient is the
      criteria rather than the amount of sulfur content in the oil.<br>
      <br>
      As can be observed from Example 2 below, the incorporation of the
      sulfur into the oil seems to be limited to about 1% by the process
      presently being used to produce the sulfurized unsaturated oils.<br>
      <br>
      The sulfur content can be much less than about 1% if desired and
      smaller sulfur content is advantageous when administered by
      injection. Varying the amount of sulfur below about 1%
      incorporated in the polyunsaturated oils for oral administration
      only affects the number of capsules to be taken at a given time by
      a particular patient.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments to date indicate that the optimum sulfur content for
      oral administrations is about 1% and by injection about 0.1% to
      0.3% by weight of the sulfur based on the weight of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      The dosage prescribed to a patient will, of course, vary depending
      upon theparticular patient and the number of cigarettes being
      smoked a day. In general, a daily dose of 3-5 capsules containing
      1 ml of the sulfurized oil for the first three days after which
      the dose is progressively reduced. For example, for a heavy smoker
      it is advantageous for the patient to take about 8 capsules
      containing 1 ml of the sulfurized oil containing about 1% sulfur
      for the first three days and take 3 or 4 capsules a day for the
      next four days. This is generally sufficient to eliminate or
      reduce the desire or need for tobacco. The desire or need for
      tobacco generally disappears from the patient within 2-3 days.
      This single treatment may last for months. However, the patient
      can be given an additional supply of the encapsulated sulfurized
      oil and directed to take additional capsules if he feeds any
      desire or need for tobacco.<br>
      <br>
      When the sulfurized oil is used by injection, such as
      intramuscularly or intraperitoneally, it is advantageous to have
      the sulfur contained in the sulfurized oil below about 0.5% by
      weight, preferably between about 0.1% to 0.3% by weight, and to
      inject from 1/2 to 3 ml of this solution into the patient.
      Experiments to date indicate that the injection of sulfurized oil
      is somewhat painful when it contains above about 0.3% sulfur.
      Administration by injection is, of course, not necessary, but it
      may act faster initially. Generally if a person is given the
      injection of the sulfurized oil, he can also be given a supply of
      the oral capsules and directed to take 3 to 4 capsules a day
      following the injection for one week.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A sulfurized oil was prepared by mixing 50 grams of sublimed
      sulfur, obtained from Fisher Scientific, with one liter of sesame
      oil. The mixture was heated under fairly rapid agitation by air to
      a temperature of about 127 DEG C. until all of the sulfur was
      incorporated into the sesame oil. The reaction mixture was then
      cooled to room temperature, producing at the bottom of the
      reaction vessel a small amount of sulfur crystals. The crystals
      were then separated from the liquid by filtration and about half
      of the crystals replaced in the resulting liquid, wherein they
      slowly dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting sulfurized oil was then incorporated into gelatin
      capsules in the amount of 1 ml per capsule.<br>
      <br>
      Four patients reported that they had been smoking three to four
      packs of cigarettes a day. The patients were given 5 of the above
      capsules the first day and directed to take 5 capsules on the
      second and third days and 3 capsules for each of the four days
      remaining in the week. The patients reported no strong desire for
      tobacco after the third day and reduced their smoking habits to
      three to four cigarettes a day without nervousness or withdrawal
      symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Another patient who was smoking 60-80 cigarettes a day for the
      last 20 years was given 8 capsules of 1 ml of 1% sulfur in oil for
      three days. She remained without discomfort during this period.
      The treatment lasted 10 days with progressive reduced doses. The
      patient did not smoke for four months without the need for desire
      for smoking tobacco.<br>
      <br>
      A number of other persons who were chronic smokers of varying
      degrees were also given the same dosage. Over all, based on the
      total number of persons so treated about 80% had an almost
      immediate loss of the desire to smoke while about 50% of the
      remaining persons felt a considerable loss of the desire to smoke
      after some time had passed while continuing the treatment. The
      remaining persons apparently did not lose their desire to smoke.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      4 g. of sulfur were weighed out and placed in an Erlenmeyer flask.
      200 ml of sesame oil were added; the contents were heated to 125
      DEG C. with stirring until the sulfur dissolved. The flask was
      removed from heat and allowed to cool to room temperature (5
      hours). Sulfur crystals were filtered into a Buchner funnel,
      washed thoroughly with hexane to remove residual oil, and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      The above example was repeated three times. The washed sulfur
      recipitated was weighed in each trial and the amount of sulfur in
      the sesame oil calculated by difference as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Initial weight of sulfur: 4.00 g<br>
      Weight of sulfur ppt.:<br>
      Trial 1 2.05 g<br>
      Trial 2 2.00 g<br>
      Trial 3 1.92 g<br>
      % (w/v) sulfur in sesame oil:<br>
      Trial 1 1.02%<br>
      Trial 2 1.00%<br>
      Trial 3 0.99%<br>
      Average 0.99%<br>
      <br>
      From this it was concluded that the solutions contained
      approximately 1% sulfur after filtration.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also includes the use of selenium in place of
      elemental sulfur and for the same use. When using selenium it is
      combined with the allylic moiety in the same manner as sulfur but

      This invention relates to a method of treating alcoholism and for
      eliminating, reducing or preventing alcohol intoxication or the
      manifestations of alcohol intoxication in humans by administering
      thereto a therapeutic composition comprising an ammonium compound
      or compounds, said compounds and each of said compounds having a
      pH greater than 5.0 when in aqueous solution at a concentration of
      5 grams per 100 grams of solution (5 weight percent), and
      particularly ammonium salt compounds containing ammonium cations
      and sulfur anions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Various pharmaceutical uses of ammonium compounds have long been
      recognized. For example, the following ammonium compounds (as
      listed in Hackh's Chemical Dictionary, 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New
      York pages 37-40) have the following medicinal uses as indicated
      therein. Ammonium acetate is used as an antipyretic and
      diaphoretic antidote in formaldehyde poisoning; ammonium benzoate
      has been used as an antipyretic, diuretic and alternative;
      ammonium bromide is used to treat neuralgia; ammonium carbamate is
      used as a stimulant; ammonium carbonate carbamate (Hartshorn salt)
      is used as a heart stimulant; ammonium chloride is used as an
      expectorant, stimulant diuretic or disphoretic, as well as
      externally; ammonium formate is used as an antiseptic; ammonium
      hypophosphite is a nerve tonic; ammonium thiosulfate can be used
      as an antiseptic, ammonium iodide is used to treat syphilis and
      leprosy; ammonium persulfate is used as a disinfectant; ammonium
      phosphate can be used as an antirheumatic; ammonium salicylate is
      used as an antirheumatic, antipyretic, expectorant, and
      bactericide; and ammonium valerate is a hypnotic, sedative, and
      tonic. Ammonium thiosulfate has long been a standard industrial
      commodity, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,350,168 to Ziegler indicates that
      U.S. consumption of ammonium thiosulfate totaled 30,000 tons per
      year at the time of such patent. U.S. Pat. No. 3,890,428 to
      Jayawant and U.S. Pat. No. 3,973,793 to Netzger et al. indicates
      that ammonium thiosulfate has long been employed as a photographic
      fixer.<br>
      <br>
      A publication entitled "Testing for a `Sobering Pill`," DOT HS-801
      208 (1974), available from National Technical Information Service,
      Springfield, Va. 22151, discloses that a number of compounds,
      including ammonium chloride, were investigated to determine their
      potential for blocking or neutralizing the effect of alcohol on a
      human brain. While the most effective amethystic agent (a
      preventive antidote of drunkenness) found was L-dopa, with respect
      to ammonium chloride, which has a relatively low molar pH in
      aqueous solution, the publication concludes that ammonium chloride
      does not appear to act as an amethystic agent.<br>
      <br>
      None of the reference teaches the use of the compositions of the
      present invention as a treatment for alcoholism or eliminating and
      preventing alcohol intoxication or the manifestations of alcohol
      intoxication.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a method of treating alcoholism and for
      eliminating, reducing or preventing alcohol intoxication or the
      manifestations of alcohol intoxication in humans by administering
      thereto an ammonium compound or compounds, said compounds and each
      of said compounds having a pH greater than 5.0 moles when in
      aqueous solution at a concentration of 5 weight percent.
      Especially preferred embodiments are the salt compounds containing
      ammonium cations and sulfur anions. The ammonium compound can be
      administered to the patient by various known methods of injection
      or orally as by capsule form.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is to be especially noted that applicant is not claiming a cure
      for alcoholism; rather, this invention encompasses a method to
      treat acute and chronic effects of alcoholism or its
      manifestations or to prevent or reduce alcohol intoxication in
      which are used therapeutic compositions comprising any non-toxic
      compound having ammonium cations or substituted ammonium in its
      molecule, or mixtures or more than one such compound wherein said
      compound and each of said compounds have a pH greater than 5.0
      when in aqueous solution at a concentration of 5 weight percent.
      Such preparations administered to humans may also help in
      detoxification of patients addicted to alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the aforesaid pH requirement, it is to be observed
      that, for example, within a series of ammonium salts of a
      polybasic acid the most preferred therapeutic agent is that
      molecule with no acidic hydrogen ion; the next most preferred is
      that molecule with one acidic hydrogen ion, and the least
      preferred is that with only one ammonium ion. For example,
      triammonium phosphate is preferred over diammonium monohydrogen
      phosphate, which in turn is preferred over monoammonium dihydrogen
      phosphate.<br>
      <br>
      Also comprising a class of preferred embodiments are those agents
      containing sulfur in the anion portion of the molecule. Exemplary
      of effective agents containing sulfur are ammonium thiosulfate,
      ammonium sulfate, ammonium sulfamate and ammonium tetrathionate.
      The most effective of these is ammonium thiosulfate, with ammonium
      sulfate for treatment of the effects of alcohol in humans being
      somewhat less effective.<br>
      <br>
      Ammonium acetate has likewise been shown to be a preferred
      embodiment of the instant invention.<br>
      <br>
      Especially preferred are those ammonium salts of weaker acids and
      the most basic ammonium salts of polyprotic acids, that is, salts
      with comparatively basic aqueous solutions. To exemplify the
      preferred anions, namely those forming aqueous solutions with a pH
      greater than 5.0 at a concentration of 5 weight percent (5 grams
      of salt per 100 grams of solution), the following table gives
      measured pH values for certain salt species mentioned in this
      application.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE I</b><b><br>
      </b><b>pH of 5 Weight Salt Percent Solution</b><b><br>
      </b>Ammonium thiosulfate<br>
      5.966<br>
      Ammonium sulfamate<br>
      5.335<br>
      Ammonium acetate 6.790<br>
      Ammonium sulfate 5.263<br>
      Ammonium chloride<br>
      4.761<br>
      <br>
      For each salt, 5.000 grams of reagent grade material was weighed
      and added to 95.00 grams of water. An Orion Ionalyzer Model
      digital 801 pH meter with glass electrode measured against a
      saturated calomel electrode was standardized by a pH 7.00 buffer.
      The instrument was allowed to equilibrate for three minutes
      between each sample, and the electrodes were rinsed with
      carbonate-free deionized water. Manual temperature control was set
      at 25 DEG C. After the last sample was measured, the instrument
      was checked by measuring the pH 7.00 buffer solution and the first
      sample, and consistent readings were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Also contemplated within the scope of this invention are cations
      containing substituted ammonium, where one or more of the four
      hydrogen atmos attached to the nitrogen is substituted with, for
      example, an alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl. Such compounds
      are well recognized in the art, and the same preferred anions
      outlined above are preferred when combined to form salts of
      substituted ammonium cations. Only those anions which form
      nontoxic compounds with substituted ammonium cations are
      contemplated as within the scope of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that the dosage of the compound or compounds
      encompassed within the scope of this invention would be limited to
      that dosage normally toxic to a human subject, as determined by
      both body weight and the particular physiological constitution of
      the human subject. Furthermore, it is contemplated to limit the
      dosage of the compound or compounds of the invention to that
      dosage which, when given with alcohol, constitutes a non-toxic
      amount.<br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding the requirement that compositions falling within
      the scope of the instant invention be nontoxic, studies of acute
      subacute and chronic toxicity of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium
      sulfate and ammonium acetate in mice and rats have shown a low
      toxicity for their administration through gastric catheter.
      Studies in humans have demonstrated likewise the nontoxicity of
      ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium sulfate and ammonium acetate to the
      extent that even repeated administration of up to 20 capsules per
      day (1 gram/capsule) for a period of 10 days produced no clinical
      or analytic noxious effects.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the present invention can be prepared and
      suitably administered in any of a number of conventional ways,
      such as by incorporating the compound or compounds into gelatin
      capsules or any other conventional soluble capsule, in an amount
      up to about 1.2 grams of the compound or compounds per capsule;
      preferably the capsules should contain either about 0.5 grams or
      about 1.0 gram. The compound or compounds may also be administered
      in any conventional tablet form which may contain the same amount
      of the compound or compounds as the capsule. Likewise, the
      composition may be consumed orally in a non-capsule or non-tablet
      form, i.e., in a solution comprised of the compound or compounds
      of the invention, and, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier, or diluent, such as sterile water, wherein the solution
      may contain up to about 70% by weight of the compound or compounds
      of the invention. It may thus be administered in dropwise form
      until the desired equivalent amount of the compound or compounds
      is administered.<br>
      <br>
      The compound or compounds of the invention may also be
      administered by injection, such as intramuscularly or
      intraperitoneally, wherein the solution to be injected comprises
      the compound or compounds of the invention and any conventional
      inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or diluent, such as
      sterile water, and wherein the solution may contain up to about
      10% by weight of the compound or compounds of the invention. The
      amount to be injected will depend on the equivalent amount of the
      compound or compounds that one desires to administer.<br>
      <br>
      Although, as noted, the agents of the present invention can be
      injected in aqueous solution into the body, it is preferred that
      they be administered orally encapsulated in a conventional soluble
      capsule containing in solid form the prescribed dosage of
      preparation.<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the specific amounts of the compound or compounds to be
      administered, this will be easily determinable by those skilled in
      the art and will depend, to a certain extent, upon the particular
      compound or compounds to be administered (for instance, it has
      been found that twice as much of ammonium sulfate and ammonium
      acetate as compared to ammonium thiosulfate is required to achieve
      the same result), whether one is treating those already subject to
      the effects of alcohol and exhibiting the manifestations of
      alcohol, or whether one is treating individuals so as to prevent
      the manifestations of alcohol from occurring in the first
      instance. It has been found to be an advantageous mode of
      preventing intoxication to administer to a patient one capsule
      containing approximately 1 gram of ammonium thiosulfate (twice the
      dosage for ammonium sulfate or ammonium acetate) approximately 40
      minutes before consumption of the first intoxicating alcoholic
      drink and a second capsule after the third drink. In this manner,
      it was shown that approximately 5 to 7 alcoholic drinks may be
      consumed without any outward evidence of inebriation.<br>
      <br>
      Another preferred mode for the application of the instant
      invention in the treatment of persons already partially subject to
      the effects of alcohol and exhibiting the manifestations of
      alcohol intoxication (i.e., after one or two alcoholic drinks) is
      to administer either one or two capsules, each containing
      approximately 1 gram of ammonium thiosulfate (or approximately 2
      to 4 capsules, each containing 1 gram of ammonium sulfate or
      ammonium acetate).<br>
      <br>
      For the treatment of those habitually addicted to alcohol, it has
      been found preferable to administer about 4 to 6 grams/day, i.e.,
      4 to 6 capsules, each containing 1 gram of ammonium thiosulfate
      (or approximately twice the dosage as in the case of ammonium
      sulfate or ammonium acetate) for two days and thereafter to reduce
      the dosage to approximately 1 to 2 grams/day as required.<br>
      <br>
      A possible explanation for the activity of the ammonium salts of
      this invention is that such compositions counteract the effects in
      the body of fatty acids, and prevents conjugation of substances
      with positive polar groups. Any suggested mode of operation or
      explanation of the mechanism of activity of the present invention
      is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, and
      an understanding of such mode or mechanism is not necessary for
      the successful practice of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Tests of some of the compounds encompassed within the scope of
      this invention were carried out with mice to determine efficacy in
      altering the effects of alcohol administered to the test animals.
      Good results on the mice were also obtained with the use of
      ammonium acetate. A series of tests comparing the effects on mice
      of ammonium thiosulfate and ammonium sulfate indicate that both
      are approximately equally effective. It is expected, however, that
      the effect of ammonium thiosulfate in altering the effects of
      alcohol ingestion in humans is substantially greater than the
      effects of ammonium sulfate. Tests of some of the compounds
      encompassed within the scope of this invention were carried out
      with humans, and likewise, good results were obtained which
      demonstrate the efficacy of the instant invention.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the specification and claims reference to an alcoholic
      drink means reference to an aqueous mixture of ethanol containing
      about 15-25 grams of ethanol per drink.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      Procedure--The following procedure was carried out for determining
      the ED50 (effective dose which produces the desired effect in 50%
      of the test animals) of 30% (v/v) ethanol for neurological
      deficiency in fasted mice which had been previously pretreated
      with an aqueous solution of ammonium thiosulfate: Food, but not
      water, was removed from the cages of 50 adult male albino mice
      (Charles River) on the day of the test. Five hours later the
      fasted animals were pretreated orally with 0.6 ml/mouse of a 10%
      aqueous solution of ammonium thiosulfate. Thirty minutes later a
      freshly prepared solution of 30% (v/v) ethanol was administered
      orally to the animals in groups of 10, at doses ranging from 0.5
      to 1.0 ml per mouse. Ten minutes after administering the ethanol
      the mice were placed individually on a rod rotating at 6 rpm.
      Neurological deficit was recorded if the animal was unable to
      remain on the rod for at least 10 seconds. A group of 10 fasted
      but non-pretreated mice all exhibited neurological deficit
      following a dose of 0.5 ml, thereby serving as controls on the
      activity of the freshly prepared ethanol solution.<br>
      <br>
      Findings for individual animals (+)=neurological deficit, and
      (-)=no neurological deficit are shown below in Table II with the
      summary of results set forth in Table III. The oral ED50 of
      ethanol in the ammonium thiosulfate solution pretreated animals is
      shown to be 0.76 ml, with 95% fiducial limits of 0.65 to 0.90 ml
      (determined graphically by a Litchfield and Wilcoxon plot).<br>
      <br>
      The identical procedure was carried out for determining the oral
      ED50 of 30% (v/v) ethanol for neurological deficit for
      non-pretreated mice: Freshly prepared 30% (v/v) ethanol was
      administered orally to adult male albino mice (fasted for 5
      hours), in groups of 5 to 10, at doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.50
      ml per mouse. Ten minutes later the animals were placed,
      individually, on a rotored, rotating at 6 rpm. Neurological
      deficit was again recorded (+) if the animal fell from the
      rod--i.e., did not possess the motor coordination required to
      `logroll`--in less than 10 seconds. Absence of neurological
      deficit was similarly recorded (+) if the animal had sufficient
      coordination and muscular power to remain on the rotating rod for
      10 seconds or more. The results are depicted in Table IV and
      summarized in Table V wherefrom it is seen that the dose of
      ethanol required to induce neurological deficit in 50% of the
      untreated animals (i.e., in this test the mice were in no way
      pretreated by the composition of the instant invention) is 0.17
      ml/mouse, and the 95% fiducial limits (Litchfield and Wilcoxon
      graphic method used) was 0.13 to 0.22 ml/mouse.<br>
      <br>
      Further, and in order to avoid physio-chemical problems that
      might, albeit remotely, arise if ethanol is administered orally,
      applicant also determined the intraperitoneal ED50 of ethanol in
      fasted mice. The procedural details are identical to those
      followed in the case of the oral ED50 except that the ethanol (30%
      v/v) was injected intraperitoneally. These results reveal that the
      intraperitoneal ED50 of 30% ethanol is 0.15 ml/mouse (0.12-0.19 at
      95% confidence limit) which is effectively the same as that
      obtained when ethanol was given orally. This latter finding
      confirms what has long been known, that ethanol is rapidly and
      fairly completely absorbed in the fasting state.<br>
      <br>
      By so determining the ED50 in non-pretreated mice, one could
      obtain statistically meaningful relative results in respect to the
      efficacy for the pretreatment of mice with ammonium thiosulfate.<br>
      <br>
      Results--The ED50 of 30% ethanol in non-pretreated mice was 0.17
      ml/mouse; the comparable value for pretreated mice shown in the
      tables below is 0.76 ml/mouse. This establishes that following
      pretreatment with ammonium thiosulfate nearly five times as much
      ethanol was required to induce neurological deficit.<br>

      <br>
      This Example compares the effectiveness of ammonium thiosulfate
      and ammonium sulfate as inhibitors of ethanol-induced neurological
      deficit in fasted mice. Each composition was prepared freshly as a
      10% aqueous solution from the crystalline preparation. A dose of
      0.6 ml/mouse was administered orally to 10 mice for each compound.
      Thirty minutes later 0.5 ml/mouse of 30% (v/v) ethanol was given
      orally to each mouse and, 10 minutes later, the animals were
      tested for the presence or absence of neurological deficit in the
      usual manner as described in Example 1. A group of 10 untreated
      mice were used as controls. The results are shown in Table VI with
      the summary of the results in Table VII.<br>
      <br>
      Results--It is clear that both ammonium thiosulfate and ammonium
      sulfate were highly effective as inhibitors of ethanol-induced
      neurological deficit at the dose used. It is equally clear that
      the two compounds were essentially equipotent on the basis of this
      single test.<br>

      This Example sets forth the oral Ed50 of ammonium thiosulfate vs.
      ethanol-induced neurological deficit in fasted mice. The mice used
      in this study appeared to be in good health. They were deprived of
      food, but not water, for a period of five hours preceding the
      test. A 10% aqueous solution of ammonium thiosulfate was prepared
      from the crystalline material and appropriate amounts of distilled
      water were added to provide solutions containing 7.5, 5.0, 2.5,
      and 1.25% ammonium thiosulfate. A dose of 0.6 ml/mouse of all five
      ammonium thiosulfate solutions was administered orally. Ten
      minutes later the animals were tested for neurological deficit or
      its absence in the usual manner as described in Example 1. A
      separate group of fasted by non-pretreated mice served as ethanol
      controls. The results are set forth in Table VIII and summarized

      The invention relates to a method of treating alcoholism and for
      aiding in controlling alcohol intoxication in humans by the
      internal administration of a composition produced by heating
      certain allylically unsaturated compounds sufficient to
      substantially increase the peroxide titer. The incorporation of
      sulfur in the composition during the heating has been found to be
      particularly advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      There has been much recent interest in the study of alcoholism
      involving biological, psychological, and sociological
      investigations. Publications such as the various "Proceedings of
      the . . . Annual Alcoholism Conference" and "Recent Advances in
      Studies of Alcoholism", obtainable from the Superintendent of
      Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.
      20402, indicate the rather intensive scientific investigations in
      this area. Some of these studies are concerned with the effect on
      a host produced by certain chemicals in combination with alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      An article by E. B. Truitt and M. J. Walsh appearing at p. 100 et
      sequa of "Proceedings of the First Annual Alcoholism Conference of
      the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism", DHEW
      Publication No. (NIH) 74-675 (1973) discloses a number of
      chemicals and drugs which have been reported to have anti-alcohol
      effects. Included in this list are disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram
      disulfide--see also U.S. Pat. No. 2,567,814 Jacobsen et al),
      calcium carbimide (see also U.S. Pat. No. 2,998,350 de Grunigen et
      al), and thiocyanates which are used specifically for their
      anti-alcohol properties.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,719 Marshall discloses the use of
      2-[(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)methyl]-2-imidazoline hydrochloride
      (fenmetozole HCl) for combating ethanol intoxication in mammals.<br>
      <br>
      However, an article by H. B. McNamee et al "Fenmetozole in Acute
      Alcohol Intoxication in Man", Clinical Pharmacology and
      Therapeutics Vol. 17, Number 6, pp. 735-737 concludes that, within
      the scope of the subject study, fenmetozole does not antagonize or
      significantly modify acute effects of alcohol intoxication in
      humans.<br>
      <br>
      Another publication entitled "Testing For a `Sobering Pill`" DOT
      HS-801 288 (1974) available from National Technical Information
      Service, Springfield, Va. 22151 discloses that nikethamide,
      propranolol, L-dopa, pipradrol, aminophylline, ephedrine,
      sted-eze, and ammonium chloride were investigated to determine
      their potential for blocking or neutralizing the effect of alcohol
      on a human brain; the most effective amethystic agent found was
      L-dopa.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for treating the manifestations
      of alcoholism or alcohol intoxication by aiding in the control of
      the craving for alcohol, or by aiding in the control of alcohol
      withdrawal symptoms, or by aiding in the control of alcohol
      intoxication in a human, which comprises internally administering
      to a human in need thereof an oxidized composition produced by the
      process comprising oxidizing, at a temperature of between about
      110 DEG C. and about 150 DEG C., a liquid composition containing
      at least one fatty acid or fatty ester having allylic unsaturation
      of the type<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --CH.dbd.CH--<br>
      <br>
      and/or<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --<br>
      <br>
      for a period of time sufficient to produce a peroxide titer
      substantially greater than that of the untreated compound, in a
      non-toxic amount sufficient to aid in the control of the craving
      for alcohol, or to aid in the control of alcohol withdrawal
      symptoms, or to aid in the control of alcohol intoxication in said
      person. The incorporation of sulfur into the composition during or
      before the heating of the compositions has been found to be
      particularly advantageous and represents the most effective
      composition found to date. The compositions can be administered to
      the patient by the various accepted methods of injection or orally
      in tablet or capsule form.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is desirable to have a method for treating or aiding in the
      treatment of alcoholism in a human by controlling the craving for
      alcohol, by controlling withdrawal symptoms, or by aiding in the
      control of alcohol intoxication in humans. It is further desirable
      to have a method for aiding the control of alcohol intoxication of
      a non-alcoholic person by reducing or eliminating the alcohol
      intoxication either before or after the intake of alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to such methods of treatment involving the
      internal administration to a human host of a composition produced
      by oxidizing a liquid composition containing a fatty acid or fatty
      ester, structurally characterized by allylic unsaturation, for
      example, by bubbling air through the reaction mixture. The fatty
      acid or ester advantageously includes elemental sulfur and/or a
      conventional free radical initiator such as tertiary-butyl
      peroxide during the heating step.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil, containing polyunsaturated fatty esters such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, especially a polyunsaturated
      vegetable oil. Sesame oil is a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides and is the most advantageous composition found to
      date in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized preferably should contain a significant
      percentage of molecular species having allylic moieties to render
      the compositions useful according to the invention indicated by
      the following partial structures<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --CH.dbd.CH--<br>
      <br>
      and/or<br>
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2<br>
      <br>
      As indicated, the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated
      but the composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions, as the case may be, should be oxidized or
      heated in the presence of oxygen at a temperature in the range
      between about 110 DEG C. and about 150 DEG C. The oxygen can be
      obtained by merely heating the composition open to the atmosphere
      but preferably and advantageously, the source of oxygen is a gas
      such as air injected into a heated oil such as sesame oil. The
      injected air also serves as a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      As previously stated it is most advantageous to add elemental
      sulfur such as sublimed, precipitated, or washed sulfur to the
      compositions so that the sulfur is present with oxygen during at
      least a portion of the heating period and the sulfur incorporated
      into the composition. Additionally, a previous batch of the
      oxidized oil with or without sulfur or any commonly known and
      available free radical initiator, such as tert-butyl peroxide, may
      advantageously be present during at least a portion of the heating
      period.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is added to the selected composition, for example,
      sesame oil, the temperature should be maintained at an upper limit
      within the range of about 120 DEG C. to about 130 DEG C., and
      preferably 125 DEG C. and 127 DEG C. These temperature limitations
      are based on a heating time of about one-half hour. The
      temperatures can be altered within limits depending on the time of
      heating. For example, the temperature can be 129 DEG-130 DEG C. if
      the time is shorter or even at 140 DEG C. for very short period of
      time. High temperatures for a prolonged period of time tend to
      degrade the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      If sulfur is not present during the heating period, the
      temperature should be maintained in the range between about 110
      DEG C. and about 150 DEG C., and preferably in the range between
      about 120 DEG C. and about 140 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The heat treatment is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. If sulfur is present, optimal results
      are obtained if the heat treatment is conducted for a period of
      time between about 30 minutes to about 1 hour. If a free radical
      initiator is present, or if a selected composition inherently
      contains a significant amount of initiator, the heat treatment
      period may be conducted for a relatively shorter period of time.<br>

      The precise nature of the composition which results from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known to the Applicant.
      However, while Applicant does not wish his invention limited by
      the following theory or fact, or mixed theory and fact as the case
      may be, certain evidence is available which indicates that an
      efficacious composition for the treatment of alcoholism or the
      control of intoxication in a human can be produced according to
      this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, it appears that a correlation exists between a
      composition useful for the subject purpose and its presumed
      peroxide or hydroperoxide content. By adhering to the process
      according to this invention, it has been found that efficacious
      compositions are produced which yield a significant peroxide titer
      when monitored by conventional iodometric analysis, the results
      being expressed, for example, in terms of microequivalents per
      gram or milliequivalents per kilogram. By significant peroxide
      titer is meant a value obtained which is greater than that which
      inherently may be present in the initial untreated compound.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of triglycerides which contain the allylic type
      unsaturation as described above, the resulting oxidized species is
      thought to be a hydroperoxide represented by the following partial
      structure ##STR1## as interpreted via UV spectroscopic analysis,
      inter alia.<br>
      <br>
      The data of Examples 3 and 4 below are consistent with the
      foregoing hypothesis. Trilinolein, the triglyceride of linoleic
      acid (9,12-octadecadienoic acid), the principal diunsaturated
      fatty ester in sesame oil, is subjected to the preferred treatment
      with air and sulfur. The resultant product has a number of
      properties characteristic of comparably treated sesame oil.
      Furthermore, its action mimics that of the treated sesame oil
      product in a primate model. Trilinolein is typical of a
      polyunsaturated oil, as is sesame oil, which contains about 35-47%
      linoleic acid residues in the total triglycerides.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the nature of the oxidized species, it appears amenable
      to monitoring by conventional iodometric analysis with or without
      the addition of sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      Although it appears that the activity of the composition is
      coincident with the presence of peroxides or hydroperoxides, the
      efficacious agent need not necessarily be directly derived from
      these classes. It may in fact be those species derived from
      radicals resulting from decomposition of compounds of this class
      and may involve reaction with other molecules of, for example,
      triglyceride oils or sulfur including olefinic polymerization
      products and/or lower molecular weight decomposition products of
      the oils or additional products with sulfur such as sulfides,
      disulfides, hydropersulfides, etc.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to a preferred embodiment, it appears that the
      presence of elemental sulfur (approximately 1% by weight based on
      sesame seed oil) during the oxidation of sesame seed oil acts to
      increase the amounts of oxidation products (conjugated
      hydroperoxides, diene, triene, unsaturated carbonyl) and that this
      increase appears optimal near 127 DEG C. as evidenced by UV
      spectroscopic analysis studies. In the absence of sulfur, it
      appears that the region near 137 DEG C. is optimal for the
      production of oxidation products.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, it appears that the most effective
      compositions are those which have a relatively high peroxide
      titer. Comparisons of preferred compositions, namely sesame seed
      oil or other polyunsaturated oils treated with air in the presence
      of sulfur, with other triglycerides, or triglyceride containing
      oils, including corn oil, cottonseed oil, and triolein with regard
      to their respective peroxide titers indicates a trend in peroxide
      levels concordant with observed bioactivity in alcoholics. Such
      trend of bioactivity agrees in general with the results of a
      peroxide analysis involving the above-identified oils in their
      untreated state and when oxidized in the presence of elemental
      sulfur under similar conditions as follows:<br>

      **Within experimental error.<br>
      <br>
      It is thought that a lower bioactivity and a lower peroxide titer
      of cottonseed oil is due to the presence of natural anti-oxidants.
      The elimination of the anti-oxidants from oils such as corn and
      cottonseed oil or the use of the relatively pure allylically
      unsaturated compounds or mixtures thereof will result in a
      substantially increased peroxide titer when treated according to
      this invention. Triolein contains only oleic acid moieties which
      are characterized by the allylically unsaturated group
      --CH.dbd.CH--CH2 -- and hence is quite difficult to oxidize,*
      particularly when compared to the preferred sesame seed oil or
      other polyunsaturated oils. A peroxide titer value of 35.7 meq/kg.
      has been attained for the sesame seed oil-sulfur-oxygen treated
      composition while sesame seed oil oxidized alone at 137 DEG C.
      yields a value of 63.3 meq/kg. A peroxide titer value of 35.7
      meq/kg [.DELTA.=(35.7-18.8)=16.9] has been attained for the sesame
      seed oil-sulfur-oxygen treated composition while sesame seed oil
      without sulfur oxidized at 137 DEG C. yields a value of 63.3
      meq/kg [.DELTA.=( 63.3-10.2)=53.1].<br>
      <br>
      *J.Sci. Fd Agric. 1975, 26, 1353-1356.<br>
      <br>
      Generally a substantial increase in the peroxide titer value can
      be defined as .DELTA.3 to about .DELTA.100 in cases where sulfur
      is incorporated into the composition and as from about .DELTA.3 to
      about .DELTA.400 when the oil is oxidized alone, or in the absence
      of sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      The process used for determining the peroxide titer values
      discussed and reported herein are determined by placing a 2 gr.
      sample of the composition in a flask purged with nitrogen, and
      adding thereto 2 ml. of concentrated acetic acid and 0.5 grams of
      KI. The mixture is capped to exclude air and allowed to remain in
      the dark for 30 minutes to complete the reaction. The side walls
      are then wet down with a minimum of water and approximately 1-2 ml
      of a 2% starch added thereto. The solution is then immediately
      titrated to the end point with 0.007 normal Na2 S2 O3 solution.
      The end point is white when small amounts of peroxides are present
      and slightly yellow when larger amounts are present.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions as prepared according to the process of this
      invention should be used soon after preparation as there is
      indication that the peroxide titer values and effectiveness of the
      compositions decrease upon aging.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred compositions according to this invention can be prepared
      by adding the sulfur to the oil, such as sesame oil, and heating
      the mixture with agitation at a temperature not to exceed about
      130 DEG C. It is preferable or advantageous to heat the mixture
      between 120 DEG and 127 DEG C. Heating the mixture above about 130
      DEG C. for a sufficient time causes a progressive color change in
      the mixture and otherwise appears to be detrimental. The
      temperatures given above relate to the use of sulfur with sesame
      oil. The ranges of temperatures which can be used to produce the
      compositions made according to this invention may vary with the
      particular oil being used, but generally a temperature of 120 DEG
      C., preferably 125 DEG C. to 127 DEG C., will be sufficient for
      most oils when sulfur is added.<br>
      <br>
      If the oil and sulfur is heated below about 90 DEG C., it is
      difficult to incorporate the sulfur into the oil by heating and
      stirring alone. The best results have been obtained to date by
      maintaining the temperature used in forming the compositions over
      a prolonged period of time from about 30 minutes to one hour.
      Stirring aids in the reaction, and experiments to date indicate
      that a fairly violent stirring is advantageous. The introduction
      of air into the mixture during the heating is also very
      advantageous, particularly when the mixture is not subjected to
      prolonged heating and is the preferred method. The stirring can be
      accomplished with the introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, it is cooled. Sulfur crystals
      remaining in the bottom of the reaction vessel can easily be
      removed by filtration. The remaining fluid is ready for use after
      appropriate sterilization for injection or incorporated into
      capsules, such as gelatin, for oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of sulfur incorporated into the oil is advantageously
      between about 0.1% to 2.5% by weight, based on the oil. If higher
      amounts of sulfur are used they generally precipitate out. There
      appears to be no advantage to using higher amounts of sulfur in
      any event since the ultimate dosage given to the patient is the
      criterion rather than the amount of sulfur content in the oil.<br>
      <br>
      As can be observed from Example 2 below, the incorporation of the
      sulfur into the oil seems to be limited to about 1% by the process
      presently being used to produce the sulfurized unsaturated oils.<br>
      <br>
      The sulfur content can be much less than about 1% if desired and
      smaller sulfur content is advantageous when administered by
      injection. Varying the amount of sulfur below about 1%
      incorporated in the polyunsaturated oils for oral administration
      only affects the number of capsules to be taken at a given time by
      a particular patient.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments to date indicate that the optimum sulfur content for
      oral administrations is about 1% and by injection about 0.1% to
      0.3% by weight of the sulfur based on the weight of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      The dosage prescribed to a patient will, of course, vary depending
      upon the particular patient and the purpose for which he is being
      treated. For an alcoholic, for example, it is advantageous for the
      patient to take 5 capsules containing 1 ml of the sulfurized oil
      containing about 1 to 2% sulfur for the first 3 days and to take 3
      to 4 capsules a day for the next 4 days. It is preferred that the
      patient be relatively sober when initiating the treatment. This is
      generally sufficient to eliminate or reduce the desire or need for
      alcohol. The desire or need for alcohol generally disappears from
      the patient within 24 hours. This single treatment may last for
      months. However, the patient can be given an additional supply of
      the encapsulated sulfur containing oil and directed to take a
      capsule if he feels any desire or need for alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      When the sulfurized oil is used by injection, such as
      intramuscularly or intraperitoneally, it is advantageous to have
      the sulfur contained in the sulfurized oil below about 0.5% by
      weight, preferably between about 0.1% to 0.3% by weight, and to
      inject from 1/2 to 3 ml of this solution into the patient.
      Experiments to date indicate that the injection of sulfurized oil
      is somewhat painful when it contains above about 0.5% sulfur.
      Administration by injection is, of course, not necessary but it
      may act faster initially. Generally if a person is given the
      injection of the sulfurized oil, he can also be given a supply of
      the oral capsules and directed to take 3 to 4 capsules a day
      following the injection for one week.<br>
      <br>
      To reduce alcohol intoxication, the patient is directed to take 2
      to 5 capsules (containing 1 ml oil at 1% sulfur). The alcohol
      intoxication should generally disappear within about one hour.<br>
      <br>
      To prevent alcohol intoxication 1 or 2 capsules (containing 1 ml
      oil at 1% sulfur) can be taken prior to beginning consumption of
      the alcohol or with the first drink.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A sulfurized oil was prepared by mixing 50 grams of sublimed
      sulfur, obtained from Fisher Scientific, with one liter of sesame
      oil. The mixture was heated under fairly rapid agitation by air to
      a temperature of about 127 DEG C. until all of the sulfur was
      incorporated into the sesame oil. The reaction mixture was then
      cooled to room temperature, producing at the bottom of the
      reaction vessel a small amount of sulfur crystals. The crystals
      were then separated from the liquid by filtration and about half
      of the crystals replaced in the resulting liquid, wherein they
      slowly dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting sulfurized oil was then incorporated into geletin
      capsules in the amount of 1 ml per capsule.<br>
      <br>
      A 50-year old patient, B. G., reported that he had been an
      alcoholic for 20 years consuming up to 1/5 to 1/2 gallon of hard
      liquor a day. The patient reported that he had tried
      hospitalization and different treatments without success. The
      patient was given 5 of the above capsules the first day and
      directed to take 5 capsules on the second and third days and 3
      capsules for each of the 4 days remaining in the week. The patient
      reported no desire for alcohol after the first day and felt no
      need or desire for alcohol thereafter. The patient reported that
      he was feeling exceptionally fine.<br>
      <br>
      Approximately 100 human patients have been treated to date
      according to this invention, including alcoholics, the social
      drinker when inebriated as well as to patients prior to the intake
      of alcohol. Significant results in controlling the craving for
      alcohol or controlling withdrawal symptoms or aiding in the
      control of intoxication were observed in approximately 80 percent
      of the patients treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      4 g. of sulfur were weighed out and placed in an Erlenmeyer flask.
      200 ml of sesame oil were added; the contents were heated to 125
      DEG C. with stirring until the sulfur dissolved. The flask was
      removed from heat and allowed to cool to room temperature (5
      hours). Sulfur crystals were filtered into a Buchner funnel,
      washed thoroughly with hexane to remove residual oil, and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      The above example was repeated three times. The washed sulfur
      precipitate was weighed in each trial and the amount of sulfur in
      the sesame oil calculated by difference as follows:<br>
      Initial weight of sulfur: 4.00 g<br>
      Weight of sulfur ppt.:<br>
      Trial 1 2.05 g<br>
      Trial 2 2.00 g<br>
      Trial 3 1.92 g<br>
      % (w/v) sulfur in sesame oil:<br>
      Trial 1 1.02%<br>
      Trial 2 1.00%<br>
      Trial 3 0.96%<br>
      Average 0.99%<br>
      <br>
      From this it was concluded that the solutions contained
      approximately 1% sulfur after filtration.<br>

      </b><b>EXAMPLE 3</b><br>
      <br>
      The preparation of Example 1 was repeated, except that trilinolein
      was substituted for sesame oil. The resultant product was
      significantly darker than the product of Example 1. A comparison
      of various properties of the oxidized, sulfurized trilinolein
      (OSTL) of this example with the oxidized, sulfurized sesame oil

      The oxidized, sulfurized sesame oil (OSSO) of Example 1 and the

      tested for their efficacy in alleviating alcohol withdrawal
      symptoms in an alcohol-addicted monkey, using untreated sesame oil
      as a placebo. In each case, a monkey was addicted to ethyl alcohol
      by infusion of 5 ml/hr for 28 days of a solution ranging between
      15 and 30% ethyl alcohol in normal saline. The ethyl alcohol
      solution was administered via an indwelling silastic catheter
      implanted into the jugular vein. The presence of and severity of
      withdrawal was evaluated according to the presence and severity of
      specific symptoms, which are known to be exhibited by rhesus
      monkeys upon removal of alcohol in a dependent animal. Evaluation
      was based on a scale of 0: symptom not present, 1: mild presence
      of symptom, 2: moderate presence of symptom, and 3: severe
      presence of symptom. The symptoms evaluated were: generalized
      tremors, muscle fasciculations, elicited hyperreflexia,
      spasticity, rigidity, spontaneous hyperreflexia, fright,
      salivation, mydriasis, retching-vomiting, convulsive poses,
      convulsions, aggression, nervousness, excitability, and evoked
      threat.<br>
      <br>
      During the 5-day placebo withdrawal period, which immediately
      followed the 28-day addiction period, the monkey received 5 ml of
      sesame oil injected into orange slices. The withdrawal symptoms
      were evaluated daily during this period. At the conclusion of the
      placebo withdrawal period, the animal was re-addicted to the ethyl
      alcohol over a 14-day period as described above. This was
      immediately followed by a 5-day drug withdrawal period. During
      this period, the animal received a daily dose of 5 ml of either
      OSTL or OSSO injected into orange slices and the daily withdrawal
      symptoms were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 2, where
      the lower the score, the less severe the symptoms and the more
      efficacious the therapeutic effect compared to placebo
      administration.<br>

      The invention relates to a method for making a composition which
      comprises selecting at least one fatty acid or fatty ester
      compound having an allylic unsaturation of the type
      -CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH- or -CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2-, adding to said compound a
      salt of an element having a rhombohedral crystal structure, such
      as Bi, Hg, As, B, Sb or Sm, to form a mixture, heating said
      mixture above about 260 DEG C. for a sufficient period of time to
      incorporate at least about 0.1% by weight of the element into the
      compound, cooling the mixture, and recovering the incorporated
      compound as the remaining fluid of the mixture. The invention also
      relates to the reaction products thus produced along with methods
      of administering these compositions to a subject to treat abnormal
      conditions caused mainly by a catabolic imbalance.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure relates to anabolic agents of new lipidic
      compositions which have incorporated therein Bi or a similar
      element having a rhombohedral crystal structure, a method for
      preparing these compositions, and a method of use thereof to treat
      various conditions in a subject due mainly to a catabolic
      abnormality or imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises novel compositions of lipidic materials,
      such as fatty acids, esters, or oils which include a group of
      elements having a rhombohedral crystal structure, such as Hg, Bi,
      As, Sb, B and Sm, incorporated therein. These compositions are
      made by heating the lipidic material to a temperature of at least
      about 260 DEG C. for a sufficient time to incorporate a
      predetermined amount of the element into the oil. At least about
      0.1% can be used, although amounts between about 0.5 and 10%,
      preferably about 5%, are preferred.<br>
      <br>
      These compositions of the invention are anabolic or anti-catabolic
      agents and may be administered to a patient who has a catabolic
      imbalance as evidenced by symptoms of certain diseases or adverse
      effects, to correct such imbalance, to treat the symptoms of
      diseases or adverse effects caused by the imbalance, as well as to
      have an antiviral action.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Inspite of the most intensive research efforts, practically little
      progress has been obtained in the treatment of most diseases, and
      especially in the treatment of AIDS--today the modern lethal
      plague. The following represents the basis for an approach
      important also for the results of its clinical applications.<br>
      <br>
      My research has shown the capital importance of the recognition of
      different pathogenic occurrences with direct application for the
      therapeutic approach. I have thus shown the existence of a
      dualistic pathogenesis, anabolic--constructive or
      catabolic--destructive state which governs the biology in all its
      aspects. The normal state results from a dynamic balance between
      alternating anabolic and catabolic processes, while the abnormal
      state corresponds to imbalances due to the abnormal processes.<br>
      <br>
      My new concept that the anabolic or catabolic character represents
      the fundamental aspect of a disease has put the problems of the
      pathological conditions from their pathogenesis to therapy
      entirely on a new basis.<br>
      <br>
      Symptoms and analyses are serving to recognize the imbalance
      present and consequently to guide the choice and necessary amounts
      of appropriate agents to be administered. Fever, diarrhea,
      vomiting, nausea, perspiration, pain with an alkaline pattern, and
      insomnia represent the main symptoms of the catabolic imbalance.
      In blood analyses, the catabolic imbalance is evidenced by a high
      red cell sedimentation rate, eosinopenia, and leukopenia with high
      serum potassium. In the urinary system, characteristic analyses
      show a high oxyreduction potential, high specific gravity, low
      surface tension, low pH, and a low chloride excretion. The
      opposite symptoms and analyses correspond to an anabolic
      imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      The further study of the cyto-histological changes have shown the
      anabolic imbalance to correspond to cells with manifest youth
      character, while the catabolic to correspond to old cells with
      pyknosis and kariorhetic changes. The study of these analyses has
      shown that while the oxyreduction is indicating a basic imbalance
      as related to the subnuclear level, other analyses, mainly the pH
      and the surface tension, are corresponding to superior level, and
      are consequently subject to more rapid and less general changes.
      While the oxyreduction provides information of a general more
      fixed basic imbalance, the pH and the surface tension are subject
      to more rapid and less basic changes. These considerations have
      special importance for the guided therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Parallel to the recognition of the anabolic and catabolic
      imbalance, I studied the factors inducing them, to find the
      special role of the lipids. The study of the lipids in general has
      led to a new definition of these agents, as polar-nonpolar
      substances with the nonpolar group predominant. According to this
      research, the lipids represent the principal constituents, while
      the water-soluble fractions represent the secondary ones. The fact
      that the polar groups have electrostatic forces results in the
      existence of positively and negatively charged lipids. The most
      important positive lipids are the sterols, while the negative are
      the fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that the anabolic imbalances are directly related to
      the intervention of the lipids with positive polar groups,
      respectively, the sterols, while the catabolic imbalances result
      from the intervention of abnormal fatty acids, respectively,
      trienic conjugated compounds.<br>
      <br>
      All the lipids of the body have their polar groups bound except
      for the brain and the red cells, which have free lipids. I have
      found that the lipids of the abnormal lesions are free, not
      combined, a fact which explains their special activity in the
      pathological conditions. As a direct consequence of this
      occurrence, I found that a lipid introduced in the body acts more
      directly upon the lesions.<br>
      <br>
      I applied the dualistic concept for the study of the agents used
      therapeutically to find them to have either an anabolic or a
      catabolic character. I used an entire series of very concordant
      tests to determine this character. The study of the second day
      wound crust pH has shown a change toward more alkaline values for
      the agents with a catabolic action and more acid values for those
      with anabolic properties. The study of the curve of the surface of
      a healing wound has shown the presence of several peaks of the
      curve. An anabolic agent makes these peaks disappear, while a
      catabolic agent increases their value or numbers.<br>
      <br>
      The study of the influence exerted by agents upon the oxygen
      intake by cancer cells or of yeast has shown a reduction of oxygen
      intake for the anabolic agents and an increase for the catabolic
      agents. The anabolic agents also induce a leukocytosis with
      eosinophilia, a lower sedimentation rate, a lower serum potassium,
      as well as marked urine analyses - such as higher surface tension,
      lower specific gravity and higher pH. The catabolic agents provide
      opposite changes, in these blood and urine analyses. In general,
      the alcohols and amines induce anabolic changes while the acids,
      aldehydes and ketones induce catabolic changes.<br>
      <br>
      I have studied under this specific dualistic aspect many different
      elements, and have found several important characters. The members
      of the same series (i.e., those in vertical rows) of the periodic
      table have all been found to have the same anabolic or catabolic
      character. The members of the odd A series and of even B series
      are anabolic, while those of the A even and B odd series,
      catabolic.<br>
      <br>
      The study of the periodic table has shown another important
      character. All the members of the same period, i.e., those in
      horizontal rows, are predilectly working at the same level of the
      organization, with the lowest periods at the more primary or basic
      level. The 6th period (starting with cesium) is thus acting
      predilectly to the lowest organizational level of the subnuclear
      entities. The elements of the 5th period (of rubidium) are acting
      predilectly upon the nuclear level, while those of the 4th period
      (of potassium) upon the cellular level. The elements of the 3rd
      period (of sodium) act upon the tissue and organ levels, while
      those of the second period (of lithium) upon the general systemic
      level.<br>
      <br>
      It was this special systemization of the elements which has its
      main application in the study of their biological actions. Of
      special interest are the elements of the 6th period, which are
      acting predilectly at the subnuclear level.<br>
      <br>
      I have also shown that different biological independent entities
      correspond to different levels of the organization. For example,
      the viruses are thus recognized as subnuclear entities, while the
      microbes as nuclear entities and not as cells as erroneously
      considered.<br>
      <br>
      As a direct consequence, it was recognized that the elements of
      the 6th period would have special action upon the subnuclear level
      formations of the complex individual and at the same time on the
      viruses as being entities corresponding to this special level. It
      was under this aspect that these elements were further studied.
      Cs, Hb, W, Os, Pt, Hg, Tl and Bi are members of the subnuclear
      level and were found to be anabolic agents having anticatabolic
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      I have applied other findings to this study of the elements. I
      have shown that there are the forces present in the atoms, which
      represent the factor which determine the kind of crystals they
      form. Elements forming the same kind of crystals, having similar
      forces, appear to have similar biological properties. By applying
      this view, I have found that, in general, from all the previously
      mentioned elements, only Hg, Bi, As, B, Sb and Sm have the same
      rhombohedral crystal form. In fact, all these rhombohedral
      elements, although of different series and periods have common
      biological properties: they are all anabolic. More importantly,
      the Hg, Bi, As and B have special antiseptic properties. Hg, Bi
      and As were the only elements which, for years, were used for the
      treatment of spirochetoses and more specifically, for treatment of
      syphilis. Also, As, Sb and Bi are members of the same very active
      anabolic series, the 6A. Furthermore, Bi represents also the
      anabolic element with the highest atomic weight, respectively
      acting at the lowest level of the organization. All these are
      making from the elements of the rhombohedral group of Bi, Hg, As,
      B, Sb and Sm, very highly interesting elements for special
      activities, such as antiviral and especially as anabolic agents at
      the lowest subnuclear level.<br>
      <br>
      In the therapeutic study of these agents, I have found as a
      capital character that they should have lipidic properties, that
      is, to be more soluble in neutral organic solvents than in water.
      This allows the agents to be specifically taken up by the abnormal
      formation in the subject, which formation is rich in free lipids.
      The study of the activity of the different compounds of these
      important elements has shown the capital importance of this
      fundamental lipidic character. Some salts of the elements having a
      lipidic fatty acid component, such as, for example, oleate,
      palmitate, or the like, have not shown the desired effects. I
      explained this through the fact that the element as a cation in
      the compound is easily separated and bound to other nonlipidic
      anions. I resolved this problem by having the element directly
      incorporated into the nonpolar group of a lipidic substance. I
      made this especially by incorporating the element in the nonpolar
      part of the fatty acids at their double bonds.<br>
      <br>
      In the following method, the element as such or in the form of a
      salt which is easily dissociated, is mixed with an oil or with its
      fatty acids or other unsaturated lipids, especially the
      polyunsaturated lipids. The mixture is heated to a temperature at
      which the dissociated element is attached to the lipid at their
      double bonds which, were previously bound to oxygen and which I
      found to open at this high temperature. The combination between
      the element and the double bond corresponds to an exothermic
      reaction. The heating is stopped at this moment with the result of
      the element incorporated in the nonpolar part of the fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      I have incorporated the elements of this rhombohedral group
      predilectly in vegetable oils such as sesame or safflower oil or
      its fatty acids. The problem of what compound has to be used has
      appeared capital for a good and sufficient incorporation of the
      element. The use of the element as such or other compounds has
      given insufficient results. I found that organic acid salts of
      these elements provide the best results. Thus, 5% by weight of
      bismuth oleate mixed with sesame oil is heated at around 300 DEG
      C. under constant stirring for a sufficient time in order to
      obtain a good incorporation.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil containing polyunsaturated fatty ester, such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated
      vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date
      in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage
      of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the
      compositions useful according to the invention. Such moieties are
      indicated by the following partial structures --CH.dbd.CH--CH2
      --CH.dbd.CH--and/or --CH.dbd.CH--CH.dbd.CH--CH2 --. As indicated,
      the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the
      composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions may initially be oxidized or heated in the
      presence of air or oxygen at the temperature range between about
      100 and about 150 DEG C. The oxygen can be obtained by merely
      heating the composition in a vessel which is open to the
      atmosphere, but preferably and advantageously, the source of
      oxygen is a gas such as air which is injected into the heated oil.
      Introduction of air also provides a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      The heating step is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about three hours. The temperature should be maintained
      at an upper limit within the range of above about 260 DEG to 325
      DEG C. and preferably about 280 DEG to 300 DEG C. These
      temperature limitations are based on a heating time of about
      one-half hour. The temperatures can be altered within limits
      depending on the time of heating. For example, when the
      temperature is about 265 DEG C., the time is about one-half hour,
      while temperature as high as 300 DEG C. require a shorter period
      of time for heating. Higher temperatures for a prolonged period of
      time tend to degrade the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Agitation, by stirring for example, aids in the reaction, and
      experiments to date indicate that a fairly vigorous stirring is
      advantageous. The introduction of air into the mixture during the
      heating is also very advantageous, particularly when the mixture
      is not subjected to prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred
      method. The mixing or stirring can be accomplished with the
      introduction of the air. After the reaction has taken place, the
      mixture is cooled. The remaining fluid is ready for use after
      appropriate sterilization for injection or incorporated into
      capsules, such as gelatin, for oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the compositions which result from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known. It is known,
      however, that these compositions do include the range of about 0.1
      to 10% weight percent has been found to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, although any organic salt can be used,
      including carbonate, acetate, or the like with the element bonding
      the fatty acids present in the oil. Although any amount above 0.1%
      of the element incorporated into the composition is useful, the
      preferred amount ranges between about 0.5 to 10, and most
      preferably about 5, weight percent.<br>
      <br>
      The so obtained incorporated product is used for oral
      administration, and after sterilization, for intramuscular
      injections. The incorporated element have a very low toxicity with
      no undesired side effects. A certain pharmacological activity is
      found in all the compounds of the rhombohedral elements in
      general. More accentuated are their lipidic compounds. Especially
      active, however, are the bismuth and mercury compounds
      incorporated alone or in combination in oils, in their fatty acids
      or in other different agents with lipidic properties.<br>
      <br>
      In the pharmacological activity of lipidic rhombohedral elements
      and especially of the incorporated bismuth or mercury, several
      actions are recognized. In one, the anabolic bismuth or mercury
      lipidic compound acts again the catabolic imbalance present as
      such, that is, reducing or even fully controlling this imbalance.
      This is very manifest for severe pain, controlled in less than an
      hour, by an oral intake of very small amounts of the incorporated
      bismuth or mercury compound, such as corresponding to 0.2-0.5 mg
      per dose. For intramuscular injection, a preferred daily dosage of
      between 0.5 to 10 cc per dose, administered once or twice daily,
      has been found to be generally effective, although additional
      doses could be administered for extreme situations. As such, the
      incorporated rhombohedral elements are working on many different
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      These analyses and clinical manifestations have to be changed by
      the administration of the incorporated compound. In a 5%
      preparation, amounts from about 0.5 to 10 cc daily are predilectly
      used for the treatment of catabolic imbalance. Other
      concentrations of agents can be converted to other doses
      containing the same or similar amount of active ingredient (i.e.,
      the incorporated compound). In general, the higher the dose used,
      the better are the clinical results.<br>
      <br>
      Bismuth and the other elements of the group incorporated act thus
      upon other catabolic symptoms. Frank are the changes in the
      subjective manifestations of the neoplastic diseases, especially
      pain, difficulties in breathing and others. This applies also to
      the clinical manifestations of AIDS with characteristic catabolic
      imbalances, which manifestations are often fully controlled in a
      short time.<br>
      <br>
      In another action, especially with higher doses the anabolic
      compounds and especially the bismuth or mercury incorporated
      compounds are inducing by themselves an anabolic imbalance. As
      this imbalance is not sterolic, it does not have the noxious
      effects of the usual sterolic imbalances. I have found that the
      presence of a nonsterolic anabolic imbalance is reducing the
      amount of sterols in the body. This is especially important for
      the neoplastic lesions, which are in general developing only with
      a sterolic imbalance. Consequently, especially the incorporated
      bismuth or mercury have through the nonsterolic anabolic
      exaggerated imbalance a special action also upon the anabolic
      lesions of the neoplastic diseases as well as other conditions.
      The direct anticatabolic action and the special exaggerated
      anabolic nonsterolic imbalance induced are leading to the
      destruction of such neoplastic lesions. Such organic changes were
      seen also in other conditions. Large lymphatic glands and the
      Kaposi lesions in AIDS have been reduced even after relatively a
      short treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Another very important action is this of Bi and Hg, due to the
      fact that they are part of the elements of the 6th period,
      elements acting predominantly upon the subnuclear level. They act
      especially also upon the independent entities corresponding to
      this level, i.e., the viruses. With a treatment for some longer
      time and insufficiently high doses, it is expected to obtain a
      control of such viral diseases.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that the treatment with incorporated rhombohedral
      elements has to be continued for sufficient time in adequate high
      amounts in order to obtain the desired results, i.e., other than
      the very impressive immediate effects on pain and other symptoms
      more especially.<br>
      <br>
      Bismuth, mercury or arsenic can be used also in the different
      preparations, which were used especially for the treatment of
      syphilis. These agents of incorporated rhombohedral elements are
      used successfully together with other different agents, especially
      with those having anabolic properties, to enhance their
      anticatabolic action. They are also used with active catabolic
      agents, together or following their administration, in order to
      control exaggerated anabolic manifestations.<br>
      <br>
      There are these different actions which are explaining the
      favorable effects obtained with the incorporated rhombohedral
      elements in a variety of pathological conditions, especially
      cancer, leukemias and viral conditions, mainly AIDS, herpes and
      Epstein-Barr disease.<br>
      <br>
      There are these results already obtained and especially the
      multiple successful applications, which are making from the
      lipidic rhombohedral elements compounds in general and especially
      from the incorporated bismuth or mercury special valuable weapons
      in the fight against different diseases.<br>
      <br>
      While it is apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well
      calculated to fulfill the objects above stated, it will be
      appreciated that numerous modifications and embodiments may be
      devised by those skilled in the art, and it is intended that the
      append claims cover all such modifications and embodiments as fall

      The method of treating or alleviating the clinical manifestations
      of viral diseases which exhibit alkalosis which comprises
      administering to the host a non-toxic acidic salt of an inorganic
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A study of the clinical manifestations and analytical data of
      certain viral diseases, such as the common cold, have indicated
      that a dyschlorobiotic off-balance is present in the body. Local
      alkalosis of the nose and upper respiratory tract manifested by
      the rhinorrhea and tracheal and bronchial secretions exhibited by
      the common cold are apparently a consequence of this
      dyschlorobiosis. The secretions of the clinical manifestations of
      the common cold may have a pH as high as 8 to 8.5 depending on the
      severity of the cold.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an immediate means to combat these
      clinical manifestations of such viral diseases through the control
      of the alkalosis by administration to the body of acidifying
      compositions or compounds, such as non-toxic acidic salts of
      inorganic acids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      The non-toxic, water soluble acidic salts which can be used
      according to this invention include, without limitation, the
      ammonium salts of phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric
      acid. Research to date has shown that mono-ammonium phosphate salt
      is considerably superior to other ammonium salts of inorganic
      acids. The mono-ammonium phosphate salt is also referred to as
      ammonium phosphate mono-basic. Ammonium phosphate hemi-basic is
      also included within the invention. The hemi-basic salt is
      strongly acid in reaction, while the mono-basic is mildly acid in
      reaction. Metal salts of the inorganic acids have not been found
      to be particularly effective, although some metal salts,
      particularly of an element of the first series of the Periodic
      Chart, such as lithium, potassium and cesium, could be used.
      Mixtures of the salts are also effective.<br>
      <br>
      The inorganic acid ammonium salts of this invention are
      anti-pathogenic, and thus no claim is made that the acid ammonium
      salts act directly on or kill any virus or microorganism. Relief
      of the clinical manifestations or symptoms of the viral disease,
      however, relieves the body of a host defense function and thus
      aids the body's host defense system in attacking the virus in its
      normal manner, which may result in a faster cure than might
      normally be expected.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of acidic inorganic salt administered is highly
      important. Little or no response is obtained when insufficient
      amounts are used. The exact amount to obtain relief of the
      symptoms of the viral disease will, of course, depend upon the
      particular symptoms and severity thereof exhibited by the person
      having the disease, the pH of the host, as well as the particular
      acidic inorganic salt being administered. Mildly acid salts will,
      of course, require higher dosages than strong acid salts. Research
      to date indicates that a sufficient amount of the acid salt should
      be administered to obtain a urine pH below about 5.5. With respect
      to mono-ammonium phosphate, one gram administered orally and
      repeated every half hour until the symptoms are fully controlled
      is recommended as a general rule, and for severe symptoms, higher
      doses, even up to 3 grams every half hour, may be used. Sufficient
      amounts of the acidic inorganic salts should be given to at least
      effect neutralization of the alkalosis of the host.<br>
      <br>
      A study of the use of the ammonium salts has shown a low toxicity
      (acute, subacute, as well as chronic). No side effects were
      observed except that in a few cases, symptoms of gastric acidity
      were observed, especially when using high doses. By taking food
      together with the preparation, this occurrence is highly reduced.
      The mono-ammonium phosphate and the ammonium phosphate hemi-basic
      have a very low toxicity. Both have been used in the preparation
      of foods and mono-ammonium phosphate has been used for many years
      as a food additive. The estimated LD/50 of mono-ammonium phosphate
      in humans, based on tests in mice, is about 280 grams.<br>
      <br>
      The inorganic acidic salts can be administered in any conventional
      manner such as by injection, but oral administration in gelatin
      capsules is the recommended manner of administration.<br>
      <br>
      Approximately 100 patients having the common cold and exhibiting
      the normal symptoms therefrom, including rhinorrhea and tracheal
      and bronchial secretions and local alkalosis of the nose and upper
      respiratory tract, were treated by oral administration of 1 to 3
      grams of mono-ammonium phosphate encased in a water soluble
      gelatinous capsule every half hour. The majority of the patients
      exhibited normal cold symptoms and were given 1 gram of
      mono-ammonium phosphate every half hour and the remainder who
      exhibited rather severe symptoms were given between 2 and 3 grams
      every half hour. Approximately 85 of the patients exhibited marked
      improvement with practically complete control of the cold symptoms
      within about 24 to 48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Fifteen patients having herpes simplex were treated with
      mono-ammonium phosphate administered orally at 1 gram every half
      hour. All patients responded showing distinct improvement with
      blisters disappearing within about 24 to 48 hours. Approximately 8
      patients responded within the first day of treatment. Left by
      itself, the blisters normally persist for one week or more.<br>
      <br>
      One patient with herpes zoster was treated with mono-ammonium
      phosphate administered orally at 1 gram every half hour. The
      patient responded within about 48 hours with substantial
      disappearance of the lesions. The pain, however, particularly at
      night, persisted. This is not unusual, however, since in the
      normal cure by the body host defense system, the pain occasionally
      persists after evidence of the inflammation has subsided.<br>

      Eighteen rabbits were inoculated with smallpox vaccine in the
      normal manner. The rabbits were divided into two groups of 9. The
      first group was given drinking water containing 2% by weight of
      mono-ammonium phosphate. The second group was given drinking water
      containing only 2% by weight salt. Both groups drank the normal
      amount of water. Within 24 hours the second control group
      developed strong very red inflammation in the inoculated area
      while the group to which mono-ammonium phosphate was given
      developed only tiny pink or brown spots.<br>

      A method for treating a host for inducing relief of pain or
      anesthesia which comprises administering hydrolyzed
      epichlorohydrin, magnesium thiosulfate, or a butanol at the site
      of the painful area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to methods and preparations for relieving
      pain or producing analgesia.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      A number of methods exist for treating pain: an example being U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,898,325. The applicant has found a new method which is
      particularly effective for this purpose in compositions which are
      relatively simple to prepare and administer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has now been found that by administering various agents, such
      as hydroyzed epichlorohydrin (i.e., 1-chloro-2,3-epoxy propane),
      magnesium thiosulfate, or n-butanol directly to the painful area
      of a host will relieve the pain or produce analgesia therein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is known that the manifestation of pain is observed at the
      so-called trigger points. To successfully treat such pain, the
      administration of the compounds of the invention, preferably by
      injection, is found to control the pain in the immediate area as
      well as in the entire affected region.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the invention relates to the injection of from 1
      to 10 ml of a solution of between 0.1 and 1.5 weight percent
      hydrolyzed epichlorohydrin at the trigger point or immediate
      painful area. The epichlorohydrin can be hydrolyzed by heating it
      in water. These amounts have been found to be advantageous, but
      can be higher or lower if desired. For example, up to 50 ml of a
      0.5 weight percent solution can been used for exceptionally severe
      cases.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the pain is relieved in minutes following the
      injection. If necessary, the injections may be repeated,
      preferably 1-2 days later. If a stronger pain is present the next
      day at the site of the injection, this may be the result of an
      local inflammatory reaction. When this occurs, the pain usually
      disappears the day after, and the long term results are generally
      better.<br>
      <br>
      Another approach for relieving pain is based upon the fact that
      pain generally has either an acid or alkaline pattern. This
      character is recognized through a relationship with the urinary
      pH: the acid pain being stronger with a lower pH and being weaker
      with a higher pH. The alkaline pains is just the opposite.<br>
      <br>
      The acid pain corresponds to an anabolic imbalance with the
      predominant pathogenic action caused by steroids, while the
      alkaline pain corresponds to a catabolic action, with the
      predominant pathogenic action caused by fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      Many different agents can be used to counteract these imbalances.
      For the anabolic imbalances which are evidenced by acid pain, the
      injection of a solution of magnesium thiosulfate is utilized. The
      amount of this solution includes between about 10 and 50 ml of a
      water solution containing between about 10 and 50 weight percent
      magnesium thiosulfate.<br>
      <br>
      For alkaline pain, which indicates a catabolic imbalance, a
      solution of butanol in water is used. The amount of this solution
      ranges from 5 to 25 ml of a solution of between about 5 and 10
      weight percent butanol in water. Either n-butanol or sec-butanol
      can be used, with n-butanol preferred for best results. It is
      preferable to add to the butanol solutions about 25 to 50 percent
      by weight (based on the amount of butanol) of coramine
      (niketamide) for even better results.<br>
      <br>
      As with the hydrolyzed epichlorohydrin solution, these solutions
      are preferably administered by injection. If the type of pain
      cannot be characterized as acid or alkaline, then the
      epichlorohydrin solution should be administered. It is also
      possible to use mixtures of these solutions.<br>
      <br>
      When the nature of the disease which is causing the pain is known,
      more special agents, which can treat the disease or the symptoms
      of the disease, can be added to these solutions. Also, the number
      of injections can be repeated to enhance the pain reducing effect.<br>
      <br>
      The preparations of the invention have practically no toxicity in
      the doses used.<br>

      different conditions and diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a method for preparing a bivalent
      negative selenium composition which comprises mixing gray selenium
      powder with an animal oil, vegetable oil, fish oil, or mixture
      thereof to form a suspension; heating the suspension to a
      sufficient temperature to form a red selenium/oil reaction
      product; and cooling the reaction product to recover a bivalent
      negative selenium composition containing between 0.1 and 2 weight
      percent red selenium.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the suspension is heated to about 150 to 200"C for a
      sufficent time to form a red selenium composition having at least
      about 1 weight percent selenium in the oil, and the oil is tung
      oil.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to a method for preparing a bivalent
      negative selenium composition which comprises exothermically
      reacting selenium monochloride or selenium monobromide with an
      animal, vegetable or fish oil to form a red-selenium/oil reaction
      product containing between 0.1 and 2 weight percent selenium.. In
      this embodiment, preferred oils include sesame, safflower, tung,
      corn, sardine, cod liver, or salmon oil. This method further
      comprises adding an oxidant to the oil prior to adding the
      selenium compound, wherein the oxidant is a 3-ketone, preferably
      3-pentanove or 3-heptanone.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to the red-selenium oil reaction
      products produced by these methods, along with methods for
      treating the effects of an anabolic condition in a patient which
      comprises administering to the patient a sufficient amount of one
      of these reaction products.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, this method treats the effects of an anabolic
      condition in a patient by administering to the patient a
      sufficient amount of a red-selenium/oil reaction product
      containing 0.1 to 5 weight percent selenium. In these methods, the
      amount of reaction product to be administered ranges from about
      one to 100 drops per dose, each dose administered between 2 and
      six times per day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have found that the bivalent negative selenium, in its different
      preparations, has a salutary effect, especially upon pathological
      conditions when they have an anabolic character.Such conditions
      are the neoplastic conditions, arthritis, arteriosclerosis,
      epilepsy, convulsions, arrythmia, mania, sclerosis, cyrrhosis,
      inconsolidated fractions, dermatoses, drug, alcohol, smoking,
      addiction, different viral infections, as AIDS, the common cold
      and others, and acid symptoms such as acid pain, itching, vertigo,
      dyspnea and impaired hearing.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that good results are particularly obtained with the
      administration of a bivalent negative red selenium composition.<br>
      <br>
      I have further found that especially active and with a minimal
      toxicity are the preparations in which the red selenium is a
      colloidal compound.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment of the. invention such a colloidal red
      selenium compound is obtained through an exothermic reaction
      resulting from mixing selenium monobromide or monochloride with an
      oil - or a preparation which has an oil or a material with a
      lipidic character in its constitution.<br>
      <br>
      The product of the invention, colloidal red selenium compound, is
      used in suspensions having preferably the selenium from 0.18 to
      5%. This proportion is not limitative.<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the invention, red selenium is obtained by
      progressively heating a mixture of gray selenium powder and an
      oil, preferably tung oil, until the suspended selenium is changed
      into a red selenium. Agitating the mixture by strong stirring
      facilitates this reaction. The reaction product is evidenced by a
      reddish color. The mixture is then cooled and the red selenium is
      incorporated in the fatty acid molecules.<br>
      <br>
      By further heating of the mixture, an exothermic reaction rakes
      place resulting in an undesirable and nonuseful brown color
      reaction product.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that the product of the first reddish color has a
      much stronger pharmacological action than the last brown
      incorporated product. These changes are still more manifest for
      the reddish color selenium incorporation in the tung oil, wherein
      the amount of incorporated selenium ranges from 0.1 to about 5% by
      weight.<br>
      <br>
      The red selenium composition described above can be obtained with
      any compound having lipidic properties. Such lipidic products
      include any animal, vegetable or fish oil, and more particularly,
      oils of sesame, safflower, tung, corn, cod liver, sardine, salmon
      or other fish, suspensions or solutions of phospholipids or animal
      bodies or organs, such as thymus, intestines, spleen, liver or
      others, lecithins of eggs, soya beans, Bixa seeds, phospholipids
      of other plants fungi, especially of those used to produce
      antibiotics, microbes, milk, colostrum, aminoacids, alkaline and
      acid aminoacid, proteose, peptones, histones, nucleoproteins and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      This enumeration is not limitative as to the material to which the
      red colloidal selenium is mixed, apporting its properties and
      consequently its use as applied to biological entities.<br>
      <br>
      I have shown that these reaction products have a manifest
      antineoplastic action - when administered orally, even in small
      amounts.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, by mixing selenium monobromide or monochloride
      with an oil, an exothermic reaction takes place resulting in a red
      selenium colloidal compound. I have further found that by adding
      to the red colloidal compound an oxidant its action is enhanced. A
      good preparation is obtained by having the colloidal red selenium
      administered together with 3-ketones agents such as 3-pentanone
      and 3heptanone or with other oxidizing agents. I have found that
      as oily material the use of apreparation having equal amounts of
      3-pentanone and/or 3-heptanone in an oil, results in a specially
      active antineoplastic preparation for the mixture with the
      selenium monobromide or monochloride.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the selenium monobromide or
      monochloride is mixed with a lipidic preparation, preferably
      having an oil or a fatty acid compound in its constitution.<br>
      <br>
      Especially good preparations are obtained by mixing the selenium
      monobromide or nonochloride with tung oil, safflower or fish oils
      or their fatty acids. In the different mixtures, the selenium
      monobromide or nonochloride is added in a proportion so as to
      result in a selenium/oil reaction product containing between 0.1 %
      to 5% percent red selenium.<br>
      <br>
      The products of the invention are administered orally or by
      injections in repeated doses preferably between 2 and six, - most
      preferably four times per day, each dose containing between from
      one drop and 100 drops (5 ml) according to the concentration of
      the selenium in the oil and of the specific condition to be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      No toxic effects or side effects are seen, the products of the
      invention being particularly well tolerated by patients.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of the invention due to the action of bivalent
      negative selenium as part of a lipid and of the fatty acids proper
      to the tung oil has a manifest antianabolic action. Thus, it is
      useful for treating the effects of anabolic conditions, such as
      alcohol, smoking or drug addiction. It has also shown special
      favorable effects, both subjective and objective, upon various
      neoplastic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The products of the invention are administered orally or by
      injections, preferably intramuscularly or into the lesion itself.
      Very characteristic, favorable subjective effects as on pain are
      in general obtained in very short time, indicating a more rapid
      action which was not seen with other selenium compounds. The same,
      the objective changes are obtained also in special short time.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental and clinical research have thus shown the
      exceptional therapeutic value of the red selenium and especially
      of its colloidal form - with a very low toxicity, especially in
      the minimal amounts necessary. It appears rapidly absorbed and
      consequently active even in the exceptional small amounts used.<br>
      <br>
      As the subjective and objective effects upon the neoplastic
      diseases are generally seen even with very little amounts, and
      within a short time, the method represents an important progress
      in the treatment of these conditions.<br>

      The preparation of the invention due to the action of bivalent
      negative selenium as part of a lipid and of the fatty acids proper
      to the tung oil has a manifest antianabolic action. Thus, it is
      useful for treating the effects of anabolic conditions, such as
      alcohol, smoking or drug addiction. It has also shown special
      favorable effects, both subjective and objective, upon various
      neoplastic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The products of the invention are administered orally or by
      injections, preferably intramuscularly or into the lesion itself.
      Very characteristic, favorable subjective effects as on pain are
      in general obtained in very short time, indicating a more rapid
      action which was not seen with other selenium compounds. The same,
      the objective changes are obtained also in special short time.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental and clinical research have thus shown the
      exceptional therapeutic value of the red selenium and especially
      of its colloidal form - with a very low toxicity, especially in
      the minimal amounts necessary. It appears rapidly absorbed and
      consequently active even in the exceptional small amounts used.<br>
      <br>
      As the subjective and objective effects upon the neoplastic
      diseases are generally seen even with very little amounts, and
      within a short time, the method represents an important progress
      in the treatment of these conditions.<br>

      <br>
      A method for making a composition containing a fatty acid or fatty
      ester compound and copper. The compositions produced by the
      method. Administration of these compositions to a patient to
      increase the copper content of cells or tissue having a copper
      deficiency or to treat at least some of the symptoms of diseases
      or adverse effects caused by this copper deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      It is known that the abnormal cells in general and the neoplastic
      cells in particular are poor in copper, a fact which is considered
      as including and enhancing their abnormal character. It is also
      known that the blood plasma of subjects with such abnormal
      conditions is especially rich in copper, apparently due to the
      body's attempt to correct the cellular copper deficiency. The form
      under which the copper is circulating in the blood, that is,
      mainly as ceruloplasmin, however, is not the proper form from
      which the copper can be taken by the abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention comprises novel compositions of fatty acids, ester,
      or oils which include copper incorporated therein. These
      composition are made by heating the oil component to a temperature
      of at least above 230 C for a sufficient time to incorporate a
      predetermined amount of copper into the oil. At least about 0.1%
      can be used, although between 1 and 10% is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      These compositions of the invention may be administered to a
      patient who has cells or tissue which are deficient in copper to
      increase the copper content as well as to treat the symptoms of
      diseases or adverse effects caused by the copper deficient cells
      or tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      I have found that in general, the abnormal cells and tissues in
      the body have free lipids. Thus, a lipid or compound having a
      lipidic character introduced into the body can be selectively
      taken by the abnormal cells. Accordingly, it is believed that a
      copper compound having lipidic properties is useful as a
      therapeutic agent for patients who have such abnormal cells.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that copper can be incorporated in the molecule of a
      fatty acid by heating together an organic or inorganic salt of
      copper with a fatty acid or its oil.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the fatty acid or oil is previously oxidized by being
      heated and mixed with air or oxygen. The mixtures of copper and
      fatty acids or oil are heated at a temperature above about 2300C
      for a time until an exothermic reaction is observed, which
      reaction indicates that the incorporation is taking place.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of the copper/fatty acid or oil compositions that can be
      used according to the invention include the reaction products of
      allylic unsaturated fatty acids or esters and a copper salt. These
      reaction products are produced by heating a liquid composition
      containing a fatty acid or fatty ester, structurally characterized
      by allylic unsaturation with a copper salt. Applicant believes
      that any copper salt is suitable for this invention. Preferably,
      the copper salt is an organic copper salt such as cupric acetate,
      and the liquid is preferably oxidized for example, by bubbling air
      or oxygen through the reaction mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally
      occurring oil containing polyunsturated fatty'esters, such as an
      animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated
      vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of
      triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date
      in the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage
      of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the
      compositions useful according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Such moieties are indicated by the following partial structures
      -CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH- and/or -CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2-, As indicated, the
      unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the
      composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Such compositions may initially be oxidized or heated in the
      presence of air or oxygen at the temperature range between about
      1000C and about 1500C. The oxygen can be obtained by merely
      heating the composition in a vessel which is open to the
      atmosphere, but preferably and advantageously, the source of
      oxygen is a gas such as air which is injected into the heated oil.
      Introduction of air also provides a source of agitation.<br>
      <br>
      The heating step is conducted for a period of from about 15
      minutes to about two hours. The temperature should be maintained
      at an upper limit within the range of about 2300C to 2500C, and
      preferably about 2350C to 2400C. These temperature limitations are
      based on a heating time of about one-half hour.<br>
      <br>
      The temperatures can be altered within limits depending on the
      time of heating For example, when the temperature is about 235 C,
      the time is about one-half hour, while temperatures as high as
      2500C require a shorter period of time for heating.<br>
      <br>
      Higher temperatures for a prolonged period of time tend to degrade
      the composition and should thus be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Agitation, by stirring for example, aids in the reaction, and
      experiments to date indicate that a fairly violent stirring is
      advantageous. The introduction of air into the mixture during the
      heating is also very advantageous, particularly when the mixture
      is not subjected to prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred
      method. The mixing or stirring can be accomplished with the
      introduction of the air.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction has taken place, the mixture is cooled. The
      remaining fluid is ready for use after appropriate sterilization
      for injection or incorporated into capsules, such as gelatin, for
      oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of the compositions which result from the
      above-described treatment or the identity of the effective
      component or components is not presently known. It is known,
      however, that these compositions do include copper and that a
      proportion of copper in the range of about 1 to 10 weight percent
      has been found to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, although any copper salt may be used, an
      organic salt of copper, such as cupric acetate, is preferred, with
      the copper bonding the eleostearic acid present in this oil.
      Although any amount above 0.1% of copper incorporated into the
      composition is useful, the preferred amount ranges between about 1
      to 10 weight percent.<br>
      <br>
      The products obtained have the copper incorporated in general at
      the level of the double bonds of the different unsaturated fatty
      acids, this causes their toxicity to be exceptionally low. The
      injection of 1 ml of a product having 5% copper to a mouse does
      not kill it.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper composition may be administered orally, by
      injections, sublingually or rectally in the appropriate
      formulation.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper is believed to be absorbed by the abnormal
      cells, thus compensating for their low copper content. This
      treatment produces objective and subjective improvement in the
      conditions, of patients having a variety of diseases based upon
      such abnormal cells. The neoplastic diseases are examples of
      diseased in which low cellular copper abnormal cells are found.<br>
      <br>
      Such low cellular copper abnormal cells are believed cause an
      anabolic imbalance in the body. This anabolic imbalance can be
      analyzed and diagnosed by blood and urine analyses. An
      eosinophilia (above 100/cmm), a low red cell sedimentation rate
      (below 15 ml/l hour), a low serum potassium (below 4.5 mEq), a
      urinary alkaline pH (above 7), low specific gravity (below 1.016),
      high surface tension (above 89 dynes/cm), and high calcium or
      chloride excretion are indications of an anabolic imbalance. (The
      opposite analyses would indicate a catabolic imbalance.)<br>
      <br>
      These analyses and clinical manifestations have to be changed by
      the administration of the incorporated copper compound. In a 5%
      copper incorporated preparation, amounts from about 2 to 10 ml
      daily are predilectly used for the treatment of this anabolic
      imbalance.For the neoplastic conditions with catabolic imbalances,
      low doses from 1/10 to 2 ml daily are predilectly used. In general
      the higher the dose used, the better are the clinical results.<br>
      <br>
      Interesting results are those concerning pain, the changes induced
      in the lesions manifesting first an action upon pain. Manifest
      changes in the tumors and in the subjective manifestations of the
      neoplastic diseases are obtained even in a very short time. Thus,
      the incorporated copper appears as a predilect treatment of the
      symptoms of neoplastic conditions, and possibly to the treatment
      of such condition themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Good results were also obtained in the use of the incorporated
      copper compounds for the different manifestations of AIDS
      (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) as well as for the ARC (AIDS
      related complex).<br>
      <br>
      Interesting also are the results in almost all the different
      conditions, such as neurological conditions, epilepsy and others,
      the problem of cellular copper deficiency being a general
      pathological occurrence. Interesting is the action of the lipidic
      copper products on the viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated copper composition may be administered together
      with different other agents.<br>
