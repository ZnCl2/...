      </center>
      <p><b><br>
          A unique system that can produce Hydrogen inside a car using
          common metals such as Magnesium and Aluminum was developed by
          an Israeli company. The system solves all of the obstacles
          associated with the manufacturing, transporting and storing of
          hydrogen to be used in cars. When it becomes commercial in a
          few years time, the system will be incorporated into cars that
          will cost about the same as existing conventional cars to run,
          and will be completely emission free.</b> </p>
      <p>As President Bush urges Americans to cut back on the use of oil
        in wake of the recent surge in prices, more and more people are
        looking for more viable alternatives to the use of petroleum as
        the main fuel for the automotive industry. IsraCast recently
        covered the idea developed at the Weizmann Institute to use pure
        Zinc to produce Hydrogen using solar power. Now, a different
        solution has been developed by an Israeli company called
        Engineuity. Amnon Yogev, one of the two founders of Engineuity,
        and a retired Professor of the Weizmann Institute, suggested a
        method for producing a continuous flow of Hydrogen and steam
        under full pressure inside a car. This method could also be used
        for producing hydrogen for fuel cells and other applications
        requiring hydrogen and/or steam. </p>
      <p>The Hydrogen car Engineuity is working on will use metals such
        as Magnesium or Aluminum which will come in the form of a long
        coil. The gas tank in conventional vehicles will be replaced by
        a device called a Metal-Steam combustor that will separate
        Hydrogen out of heated water. The basic idea behind the
        technology is relatively simple: the tip of the metal coil is
        inserted into the Metal-Steam combustor together with water
        where it will be heated to very high temperatures. The metal
        atoms will bond to the Oxygen from the water, creating metal
        oxide. As a result, the Hydrogen molecules are free, and will be
        sent into the engine alongside the steam. </p>
      <p>The solid waste product of the process, in the form of metal
        oxide, will later be collected in the fuel station and recycled
        for further use by the metal industry. </p>
      <p>Refuelling the car based on this technology will also be
        remarkably simple. The vehicle will contain a mechanism for
        rolling the metal wire into a coil during the process of
        fuelling and the spent metal oxide, which was produced in the
        previous phase, will be collected from the car by vacuum
        suction. </p>
      <p>Beside the obvious advantages of the system, such as the
        inexpensive and abundant fuel, the production of Hydrogen
        on-the-go and the zero emission engine, the system is also more
        efficient than other Hydrogen solutions. The main reason for
        this is the improved usage of heat (steam) inside the system
        that brings that overall performance level of the vehicle to
        that of a conventional car. In an interview, Professor Yogev
        told IsraCast that a car based on Engineuity's system will be
        able to travel about the same distance between refueling as an
        equivalent conventional car. The only minor drawback, which also
        limits the choice of possible metal fuel sources, is the weight
        of the coil. In order for the Hydrogen car to be able to travel
        as far as a conventional car it needs a metal coil three-times
        heavier than an equivalent petrol tank. Although this sound like
        a lot in most cars this will add up to about 100kg (220 pounds)
        and should not affect the performance of the car. </p>
      <p>Engineuity is currently in the advanced stages of the incubator
        program of the Chief Scientist in Israel, and is seeking
        investors that will allow it to develop a full scale prototype.
        Given the proper investment the company should be able to
        develop the prototype in about three years. The move to Hydrogen
        based cars using Engineuity's technology will require only
        relatively minor changes from the car manufacturer's point of
        view. Since the modified engine can be produced using existing
        production lines, removing the need for investment in new
        infrastructures (the cost of which is estimated at billions of
        dollars), the new Hydrogen cars would not be more expensive.
        Although Engineuity's Hydrogen car will not be very different
        from existing conventional cars, the company is not currently
        planning an upgrade kit for existing cars but is concentrating
        on building a system that will be incorporated into new car
        models. </p>
      <p>Possibly the most appealing aspect of the system is the running
        cost. According to Yogev, the overall running cost of the system
        should be equal to that of conventional cars today. Given the
        expected surge in oil prices in the near future Engineuity's
        Hydrogen car could not come too soon. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>The present invention suggests a safe
        process and system for generating energy, which may be used for
        transportation applications such as car propulsion. More
        particularly, the process of the invention is for producing
        mechanical work from heat generated by at least one exothermic
        chemical reaction. In each step of the process, at least part of
        the heat is generated by a process comprising introducing into a
        reaction chamber a metal from a metal reservoir and an oxidizer
        from an oxidizer reservoir. The metal and the oxidizer used in
        this process are of kinds that react exothermally with each
        other, and the oxidizer is oxygen of ambient air or is of a
        condensed phase origin. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This invention relates to processes for producing
        mechanical work from an exothermic chemical reaction involving a
        metallic fuel. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] There is a worldwide effort to find substitution to
        fossil energy sources due to environmental reasons or security
        of supply. Most power systems, either renewable or nuclear,
        provide solutions for electricity production, but to date, there
        is no satisfactory substitute for liquid fuel for use in
        transportation (cars, airplanes, and the like). Also, there is
        no satisfactory solution to the storage requirements posed by
        the intermittent nature of most of the renewable energy sources.
      </p>
      <p>[0003] The most common approach to this problem is to use
        hydrogen as fuel. Hydrogen can be easily produced by electric
        energy from water, and then oxidized either in traditional
        thermal machines or in fuel cells. The last concept is usually
        considered in the art to be the preferred solution. </p>
      <p>[0004] The most sever problem in the application of hydrogen
        technology is the handling of hydrogen. Hydrogen is a gas and
        for most applications it has to be either compressed or
        liquefied. Another problem is the explosive nature of hydrogen.
        Hydrogen molecule is very small and has very high diffusion
        coefficient, and tends to leek from very tiny holes. All these
        factors lead to complicated and heavy equipment that has
        prevented widespread use of the various hydrogen technologies. </p>
      <p>[0005] Hydrogen peroxide is known in the art as an oxidizer in
        propulsion systems, where either it is used to exothermally
        dissociate to form heat or as an oxidizer of conventional fuels.
      </p>
      <p>[0006] Hydrogen is known as an electrolytically obtained fuel
        in propulsion systems. However, in most of these systems some
        problems of safety, distribution and storage are not
        satisfactorily solved. Last developments in the field of
        hydrogen peroxide propulsion may be found on the following
        Internet website: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/SSC/H2O2CONF/. </p>
      <p>[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,135,361 describes a closed cycle high
        energy density heat generating system. In the heat generating
        system hydrogen peroxide is fed from a vessel at a controlled
        rate through a catalytic converter to produce water vapor and
        oxygen. A first reaction heat transfer vessel receives the water
        vapor and oxygen mixture from the converter and combines
        hydrogen provided by a second reaction heat transfer with the
        received oxygen in a combustion reaction which produces water
        and heat. The water produced by the first reaction heat transfer
        vessel is applied to the second reaction heat transfer vessel in
        which it reacts with an active metal to produce a metal
        hydroxide, hydrogen which is recycled to the first reaction heat
        transfer vessel, and further heat. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0008] The present invention suggests a safe process and system
        for generating energy, which may be used for transportation
        applications such as car propulsion. The process and systems of
        the invention are based on in situ production of hydrogen from a
        metal, and oxidizing this hydrogen by hydrogen peroxide. Both
        the metal and the hydrogen peroxide that are to be used
        according to the present invention may be produced
        electrolytically, and the propulsion obtained is of zero
        emission, which is highly required from the environmental point
        of view. </p>
      <p>[0009] According to a first aspect of the present invention
        there is provided a multi-step process for producing mechanical
        work from heat generated by two exothermic chemical reactions,
        one between a metal and water, carried out in a first reaction
        chamber to give hydrogen and heat, and the other between said
        hydrogen and a non-gaseous oxidizer, carried out in a second
        reaction chamber to give water and more heat, wherein in each
        step, metal is introduced to said first reaction chamber from a
        metal reservoir, water is introduced to said first reaction
        chamber from a water reservoir, and said non-gaseous oxidizer is
        hydrogen peroxide or a metal peroxide. </p>
      <p>[0010] According to a second aspect of the present invention
        there is provided a multi-step single-chamber process for
        producing mechanical work from heat generated by an exothermic
        chemical reaction between a metal and an oxidizer in the
        presence of a working fluid, wherein in each step, a metal is
        introduced to said reaction chamber from a metal reservoir and a
        non-gaseous oxidizer is introduced to said reaction chamber from
        an oxidizer reservoir; the metal and the oxidizer being of a
        kind that react exothermally with each other, and the heat such
        produced is transferred to the working fluid by direct contact.
      </p>
      <p>[0011] These two aspects of the present invention are derived
        from the concept of a multi-step process for producing
        mechanical work from heat generated by at least one exothermic
        chemical reaction, wherein in each step, at least part of the
        heat is generated by a process comprising introducing into a
        reaction chamber a metal from a metal reservoir and a first
        oxidizer from an oxidizer reservoir, the metal and the first
        oxidizer being of a kind that react exothermally with each
        other, and the first oxidizer being of a condensed phase origin.
      </p>
      <p>[0012] According to another aspect of the present invention
        there are provided heat machines utilizing processes according
        to the process aspects of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0013] One such aspect of the invention provides a heat machine
        comprising a first reaction chamber connected to a metal
        reservoir and to a condensed phase source of an oxidizer, such
        that metal and oxidizer may be repeatedly introduced into said
        reaction chamber. </p>
      <p>[0014] The process according to the invention is termed
        multi-step since it includes a plurality of repetitions of a
        given sequence of operations, each sequence termed a step. </p>
      <p>[0015] The way in which the metal is introduced into the
        reaction chamber is immaterial to the present invention. The
        metal may be introduced as a metal powder, as a wire, as molten
        metal, as metallic vapor, and in any other way known in the art
        per se. </p>
      <p>[0016] In the present description and claims water may be used
        in the vapor phase, as superheated vapor, or may be injected
        directly in the liquid phase. The heat of reaction or waste heat
        from the system may be used for vaporization. </p>
      <p>[0017] Hydrogen peroxide can be supplied as liquid, vapor, or
        can be decomposed prior to feeding by heat or catalytically. </p>
      <p>[0018] Fluorocarbons can be used as solid, as a melt, as a
        coating on a metal powder or wire or after being vaporized prior
        to application using waste heat. </p>
      <p>[0019] In all cases where a working fluid recycled after
        expansion is a substance is fed from a low-pressure zone to a
        high-pressure zone, a pump or compressor is introduce to
        overcome the pressure difference. </p>
      <p>[0020] The term oxidizer of a condensed phase origin is to be
        construed as an agent that is in a condensed phase (i.e. liquid,
        solid, solute in a liquid solution, etc.) or that was obtained
        in situ from a material in a condensed phase. According to a
        preferred embodiment of the present invention the reaction
        chamber wherein hydrogen is oxidized is a cylinder of an engine.
        According to another preferred embodiment of the present
        invention, the reaction chamber in which hydrogen is oxidized is
        a combustor, used for operating a turbine. </p>
      <p>[0021] Preferably, in each step, the entire amount of metal
        introduced in the reaction chamber is oxidized. Working in these
        conditions also allows controlling the temperature by
        introducing into the chamber an amount of water which absorbs
        heat, without reacting to produce heat, since the entirety of
        the metal has reacted with the first oxidizer. Part of the heat
        is contained in the metal oxide or hydroxide product, and is
        transferred to the incoming water by direct-contact heat
        exchange. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the
        first oxidizer is water, and it is present in excess, such that
        part of the water serves to oxidize the metal and the rest
        serves to absorb heat so as to become steam. This steam may be
        used as a working fluid obviating the need to use a heat
        exchanger. Such a direct contact system is known in the art to
        be much more efficient than a system involving a heat exchanger.
        Furthermore, heat absorption by the excess water helps in
        controlling the temperature in the reaction chamber and prevents
        it from reaching undesirably high values. Such undesirable
        overheating may occur if all the heat produced by the reaction
        between the water and the metal is distributed only between the
        reaction products, which are hydrogen and metal oxide or
        hydroxide. </p>
      <p>[0022] According to this embodiment, the metal oxidation
        produces not only heat but also hydrogen, which is preferably
        oxidized by an oxidizer of a condense phase origin to produce
        more heat and water. This reaction may also be carried out in
        the presence of excess water, such that the excess water is used
        to control the temperature in the reaction chamber. The use of
        excess water for oxidizing the hydrogen may have a further
        benefit of stabilizing the oxidizer, which generally tends to be
        explosive. An example for such a case is the use of a 20-50%
        aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, preferably 20-40% (w/w)
        as the condensed phase oxidizer. Such a solution is much more
        stable than concentrated (or pure) hydrogen peroxide, which
        tends to explode. </p>
      <p>[0023] According to one embodiment of the present invention the
        oxidation of the metal and the oxidation of the hydrogen are
        carried out in separate reaction chambers. </p>
      <p>[0024] Water may be added to any one of the reaction chambers
        even if it does not have to react, but is used only as means for
        controlling the temperature and/or as a working fluid. </p>
      <p>[0025] Monatomic gases may also be used as working fluids, and
        they may be preferable due to their higher efficiency in heat
        conduction. According to the invention, the monatomic gas is
        used as a working fluid and obtains the heat by direct-contact
        with the reactants, since they are neither produced nor consumed
        in the process of the invention, and they should be cooled,
        collected and recycled after expansion. An arrangement for using
        monatomic gas and a bulky indirect heat exchanger, which is much
        less effective, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,135,361, which
        provides a system using monatomic gases to conduct heat in a
        combined cycle, but without using a process according to the
        present invention. </p>
      <p>[0026] When the process of the invention is used to operate a
        turbine, and the working fluid carries with it heat that was not
        used in its expansion, this heat may be used further as an
        energy source for a bottoming cycle. This may be achieved by
        allowing the hot working fluid to condense and further cool, as
        to form gradients of pressure and temperature that may be used
        to operate a gas turbine. The use of such a bottoming cycle is
        made possible in a process according to the invention thanks to
        the absence of non-condensable gases in the reaction mixture. If
        such non-condensable gases are present, such as when hydrogen is
        oxidized with air, they interfere with the required further
        condensation and cooling. </p>
      <p>[0027] According to another embodiment, the heat of the
        condensed working fluid is used to heat steam through a heat
        exchanger, to be used in a steam turbine. </p>
      <p>[0028] Metals that are typically used in the process of the
        invention are alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, zinc, and
        other metals with relatively high energy density such as
        aluminum and boron. Some considerations for preferring a certain
        metal for a specified application may be the energy density of
        the metal (which favors aluminum and boron) safety
        considerations, metal availability, cost, and convenience of
        regeneration. </p>
      <p>[0029] Non-limiting examples of condensed phase oxidizers
        suitable for use in the process of the invention are water;
        peroxides, particularly hydrogen peroxide, its aqueous solution,
        and metal peroxides such as barium peroxide and strontium
        peroxide; and compounds that include fluorinated hydrocarbons,
        such as Teflon and other perfluorinated hydrocarbons, partially
        fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixed fluorine-chlorine
        carbonaceous compounds. The use of fluorine compounds as
        condensed phase oxidizers requires that the process/system
        include means for removal of the side-products in a way that
        does not interfere with the turbine, engine, or thermodynamic
        cycle. </p>
      <p>[0030] As mentioned, according to one embodiment of the
        invention the condensed phase source for the oxidizer is a metal
        peroxide, preferably barium, strontium, or lithium peroxide. </p>
      <p>[0031] Barium peroxide when heated with water, will release
        hydrogen peroxide. At relatively high temperature, of around
        600.degree. C, the hydrogen peroxide is decomposed, such that
        the products of the reaction are metal hydroxide and oxygen.
        Either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide may be used as an oxidizing
        agent to oxidize the hydrogen in a process according to the
        invention, but preferably, the barium peroxide is heated with
        the water to a temperature where oxygen is produced. </p>
      <p>[0032] Metal peroxide may be in situ regenerated from metal
        hydroxide or from metal oxide by reacting the hydroxide or the
        oxide with atmospheric air. This reaction allows for rejection
        of nitrogen, and the entire process allows the use of
        atmospheric oxygen for oxidizing hydrogen to operate a heat
        machine without producing nitrogen-oxides. In such an
        embodiment, carbon dioxide from the air might react with the
        metal to form a barium carbonate. To prevent poisoning of the
        system with carbonate, it may be useful to heat it to high
        enough a temperature, in which the carbon dioxide is released
        from the carbonate. Reacting the barium peroxide with hydrogen
        and water together may produce the desired high temperature and
        prevent the formation of a carbonate altogether, while oxidizing
        the hydrogen to operate the process of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0033] These reactions may be utilized to power several novel
        heat machines. In one such machine, BaO is used to clean air
        from nitrogen. Accordingly, BaO is exposed to air at a first
        temperature, T.sub.1, which favors the production of the metal
        peroxide BaO.sub.2, and the nitrogen from the air is rejected.
        Then, the temperature is increased to a second temperature,
        T.sub.2, at which the metal peroxide releases oxygen, and this
        oxygen is used as an oxidizer of condensed phase origin
        according to the invention. The heat required for increasing the
        temperature from T.sub.1 to T.sub.2 may be taken from the heat
        produced by the oxidation of the metal fuel, or, in cases where
        hydrogen is also oxidized, from the heat produced from oxidation
        of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>[0034] In another such machine, BaO.sub.2 is reacted with steam
        to provide an oxidizer. In such machine, BaO.sub.2 is exposed to
        steam to produce barium oxide or hydroxide and oxygen or
        hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen or hydrogen peroxide are then used
        as oxidizers of condensed phase origin, in accordance with the
        present invention. The metal peroxide BaO.sub.2, used as a
        starting material in this machine, may be generated either from
        the metal oxide or from the metal hydroxide by reacting them
        with oxygen, for example from ambient air, as explained above. </p>
      <p>[0035] In the machines described above, ambient air is used as
        an oxygen source. This is extremely advantageous over using
        tanks of pure oxygen, as was suggested in the prior art, and
        even over using tanks of hydrogen peroxide solution, according
        to some embodiments of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0036] In all the above regeneration processes, carbon dioxide,
        which is present in the air, may react with the metal hydroxide
        to form a metal carbonate, which should be rejected from the
        system. The formation of carbonate may be dealt with by reacting
        it with steam or decomposing it at a high enough temperature. In
        order to work in conditions with no net formation of carbonate,
        it is possible to react a metal (Ba or Sr) peroxide with steam
        and hydrogen that were formed in the reaction of the metal fuel
        (e.g. Mg) and water. Hydrogen reacts with the peroxide to give
        water and metal oxide, and this oxide reacts with steam to
        produce metal hydroxide. The conditions of the reaction will
        form enough heat so as to prevent the net formation of a
        carbonate, while allowing the use of the steam as a working
        fluid. </p>
      <p>[0037] In the context of the present invention barium and its
        compounds may be replaced by strontium or calcium and their
        respective compounds, to give similar reactions, even if under
        somewhat different conditions. </p>
      <p>[0038] Preferable processes according to the invention are
        those that allow a closed system operation with no emission. One
        further advantage of the process of the invention is that it
        makes use of metals that may be produced by environmentally
        friendly processes, which do not emit pollutants to the
        environment. Additionally, the production of metals such as
        those useable in the present invention may be carried out at
        off-peak hours, by electrolysis for example, to consume
        over-production, and these metals may be consumed for operating
        turbines and engines according to the present invention. Not
        only that, but hydrogen peroxide is known to be produced by
        electrolytic decomposition of water. Therefore, it is important
        to note, that as metal can be produced by the cathodic reduction
        of metal compounds, hydrogen peroxide may be produced by anodic
        oxidation through the intermediate formation of peroxydisufuric
        acid or other acids. Thus, there is provided according to the
        present invention a process for obtaining a metal and hydrogen
        peroxide by elelctrolitically anodic oxidation of water, said
        anodic oxidation being electrically conjugated with cathodic
        reduction of a metal compound. Similarly, there is provided by
        the present invention an electrolysis cell comprising an anodic
        half cell in which hydrogen peroxide is produced and a cathodic
        half cell in which metal is produced. Consequently, metal and
        hydrogen peroxide may be produced in one stage, i.e. in one
        electrolytic process the metal can be produced at the cathode
        and the hydrogen peroxide at the anode, saving cost and energy.
      </p>
      <p>[0039] Finally, there is provided by the present invention a
        method for operating an internal combustion engine comprising:
        (a) introducing into a reaction chamber, in each cycle of the
        engine, a predetermined amount of metal and a predetermined
        amount of water to produce hydrogen and steam, (b) delivering
        said hydrogen and steam to the engine cylinder, and (c)
        combusting said hydrogen inside said cylinder with oxygen. The
        amount of water introduced into the reaction chamber is
        determined such that a portion of the water reacts with the
        entire predetermined amount of metal to produce hydrogen and
        heat, and the rest of the water is heated by said heat to a
        predetermined temperature, at which the steam enters the
        cylinder of the engine. Preferably, this temperature is of
        between about 300.degree. C. and about 1200.degree. C., most
        preferably about 400-700.degree. C. The reaction chamber should
        be separated from the cylinder, to ensure that the cylinder is
        protected from the metal oxide created in the reaction chamber,
        since such metal oxides might be very erosive. </p>
      <p>[0040] The oxygen in (c) may be of condensed phase origin or of
        gaseous origin, particularly ambient air. </p>
      <p>[0041] In case an oxidizer of condensed phase origin is
        preferred, it may be advantageous to use metal peroxide as an
        oxidizer source, and react it with a portion of the steam
        produced in (b) to give oxygen that is introduced into the
        engine cylinder. The metal peroxide may be BaO.sub.2 or other
        peroxides that may be regenerated in situ as explained above.
        Another preferred embodiment is to use peroxide of metal that
        cannot be regenerated in situ, but has very high oxidizing power
        per unit weight, such as lithium. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>[0047] FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of the present
        invention, according to which there is provided a heat machine
        100 comprising a combustor 102 connected to a metal source 104,
        a water source 106, and a hydrogen peroxide source 108, such
        that metal, water, and hydrogen peroxide may be introduced into
        the combustor 102 in a controlled manner. Required valves and
        pumps are not shown in the figure for the sake of simplicity,
        but choosing and placing them in the machine 100 is a
        straightforward task for a person skilled in the art. The
        combustor 102 has a nozzle 110, through which steam may expand
        towards a turbine 114 thereby producing useful energy. In
        operation, water coming from the water source 106 reacts in the
        combustor 102 with metal coming from the metal source 104 to
        produce hydrogen, heat, and metal oxide 118. </p>
      <p>[0048] To control the temperature, additional water (beyond the
        amount required to react with the metal) is injected into the
        combustor 102 from the water source 106. This additional water
        is converted to steam, thereby absorbing some of the heat
        produced by the exothermic reaction of the metal with the water.
      </p>
      <p>[0049] It should be noted that as the water is injected into
        the combustor 102 in the liquid phase, a very small amount of
        work is required, while a significant increase in pressure is
        achieved due to the evaporation of this water in the combustor.
        This pressure increase, obtained with little work consumption,
        is one of the advantages of the present embodiment over classic
        heat machines, where air is compressed by a compressor before
        fuel is introduced therein. </p>
      <p>[0050] Next, hydrogen peroxide, or a solution thereof, from
        source 108 is added to the hot mixture of hydrogen and steam
        present in the combustor 102. The peroxide reacts with the
        hydrogen to produce water and additional heat, and the pressure
        and temperature in the combustor 102 rises even more. </p>
      <p>[0051] A valve (not shown) is opened to allow the steam to
        expand through nozzle 110 into the turbine 112. In this
        expansion the steam is cooled somewhat, but it still may carry
        with it enough heat to power a bottoming cycle 120, such as a
        gas turbine (if the quality of the steam is high enough) or a
        heat exchanger. Downstream of the bottoming cycle 120 is a
        condenser 122 wherein remaining steam, if any, is condensed.
        Water from the condenser 122 is pumped back to the water source
        106, such that no material is emitted from the system, except
        for excess water and the metal oxide 118, from which metal may
        be regenerated, albeit not in situ, as discussed in the summary
        section of this specification. </p>
      <p>[0052] The metal oxide 118, as any other solid product produced
        during the operation of a process according to the invention,
        may be removed by methods known in the art per se, such as
        filtering out the metal oxide or rotating the combustor 102 to
        create centrifugal forces by which the metal oxide 118 may be
        separated from the working fluid. A similar effect may be
        achieved by imparting a spiral configuration to the flow of
        working fluid. </p>
      <p>[0053] FIG. 2 illustrates another heat machine 200 according to
        the present invention. The machine 200 comprises a pre-combustor
        202, connected to a metal source 204, and a water source 206 to
        receive therefrom metal and water. Pre-combustor 202 is also
        connected to a combustor 207, such that the combustor may be fed
        by a hydrogen coming from the pre-combustor. The combustor 207
        is connected to a hydrogen peroxide source 208 to receive
        therefrom hydrogen peroxide or a solution thereof, and
        downstream of the combustor there is a turbine 210, which is
        powered by steam generated in the combustor. Downstream of the
        turbine 210 is a bottoming cycle 220, such as a turbine or heat
        exchanger followed by a condenser 230, connected also to the
        water source 206, such that water condensed in the condenser may
        be returned to the water source. </p>
      <p>[0054] In operation, metal, coming from the source 204 and
        water (typically in excess), coming from the source 206 react in
        the pre-combustor 202 to produce hydrogen, steam and metal
        hydroxide. The metal hydroxide is rejected, either as a solid or
        a solution, while the hydrogen is fed into the combustor 207
        together with hydrogen peroxide solution, introduced from the
        source 208. In the combustor 207 the hydrogen and the hydrogen
        peroxide react to form high-temperature steam. Now the combustor
        207 has steam from three sources: the oxidation of hydrogen,
        which took place within the combustor 207; heating of water from
        the hydrogen peroxide solution by the heat produced during said
        oxidation; and steam created in the pre-combustor 202, due to
        the excess water used for metal oxidation therein. The steam in
        the combustor 207 then flows into the turbine 210, the bottoming
        cycle 220, the condenser 230 and back to the water source 206,
        as in the embodiment described in relation to FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>[0055] The concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution used for
        the oxidation of hydrogen can be determined according to the
        amount and temperature of steam required for operating the
        turbine 210. It is also possible to connect the combustor 207 to
        the water source 206 in order to allow water addition to the
        combustor 207, which is independent on the concentration of the
        hydrogen peroxide solution. </p>
      <p>[0056] FIG. 3 shows another heat machine 300 according to the
        invention. The machine 300 uses metal 304 as its fuel and a
        fluorocarbon compound 308 as an oxidation agent. Equivalent
        amounts of the metal and the fluorocarbon compound 308 are
        introduced into the combustor 302 to form metal fluoride and
        carbon, which are rejected from the cycle. Simultaneously, a
        monatomic working fluid, such as argon, is added from a working
        fluid source 309 to the combustor 302. The working fluid is
        heated in the combustor 302 by the heat generated by the
        exothermic reaction between the metal and the fluorocarbon and
        expanded through a turbine 310 to produce power. </p>
      <p>[0057] FIG. 4 presents a machine 400, which is a modification
        of the embodiment of FIG. 1. According to this modification,
        metal fuel together with carbon or any carbonaceous material are
        oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to form metal carbonate as final
        solid product that has to be rejected. For the sake of
        simplicity, the sequence of introducing the reactants is not
        presented in detail. Since some metals tend to from carbides
        when heated together, it may be advantageous to oxidize the
        carbon and the metal in separate compartments, to form metal
        hydroxide and CO.sub.2, and only later to let the metal
        hydroxide and the carbon dioxide react together to produce a
        metal carbonate. The working fluid is steam that absorbs heat in
        the different steps and eventually is fed to the turbine to
        produce energy. Such a system have the advantage that it may use
        fuels of low degree, that if supplied to conventional engines,
        exhaust CO.sub.2, sulfur, lead, and other pollutants, while in
        the present embodiment, these pollutants react with the metal to
        form solid end products that are rejected, and not exhausted
        into the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>[0058] FIG. 5 represents another heat machine 500 in accordance
        with the present invention. The machine 500 is an internal
        combustion reciprocating steam engine comprising a reactor 502,
        connected to a metal source 504 and to a water reservoir 506, to
        allow the reaction of metal with water in the reactor. The
        reactor 502 is also connected to a cylinder 550, which is being
        connected to a hydrogen peroxide source, 508 and to the water
        reservoir 506, such that upon combustion of hydrogen with
        hydrogen peroxide in the cylinder 550 to produce steam, the
        steam expands to move a piston 552, thereby partly condensing
        and leaving the cylinder back to the water reservoir 506 through
        condenser contained therein. The said movement of the piston 552
        is used for producing useful energy, and the piston may then be
        brought back to its initial position against the pressure of the
        condensed water in the cylinder, which is very low. Valves
        allowing the continuous operation of the engine are provided,
        opened and closed as required, as well known in the art of
        engineering. </p>
      <p>[0059] FIG. 6 illustrates a heat machine 600 similar to that
        illustrated in FIG. 5, only here, hydrogen peroxide source is
        not needed, since ambient air is used to oxidize the hydrogen in
        the cylinder 650. In order not to form N-oxides, that may be
        formed if hydrogen is reacted with air, the air goes first
        through a barium oxide reservoir 680, where it is reacted to
        give barium peroxide. The nitrogen is discharged. Then steam is
        produced via a heat exchanger in the reaction chamber 602 and
        allowed to enter to the reservoir 680, where barium peroxide
        reacts to release oxygen, and the oxygen is pumped into the
        cylinder 650, where it reacts with hydrogen coming in from the
        reactor 602. </p>
      <p>[0060] FIGS. 7A to 7E describe the cyclic operation of a
        four-tact reciprocating engine cylinder 701 (corresponding to
        the cylinder 650 of FIG. 6), where the barium oxide reservoir
        680 is replaced with a barium oxide/barium peroxide porous
        filter 703, being an integral part of the cylinder 701. Parts
        shown in these figures, and the numerals referencing them are: </p>
      <p>1 The cylinder 701; A piston 702; The barium oxide/peroxide
        porous filter 703; An air valve 704; A steam valve 705; and An
        injector of steam and hydrogen 706. </p>
      <p>[0061] FIG. 7A illustrates an air-intake tact, in which ambient
        air is sucked through air valve 704 by the down movement of the
        piston 702, and passes through the barium oxide/peroxide porous
        filter 703, which absorbs the oxygen from the air (by reacting
        with it to form barium peroxide) and lets the nitrogen pass into
        the cylinder. </p>
      <p>[0062] FIG. 7B illustrates the nitrogen rejection tact, in
        which nitrogen is blown-off from the cylinder 701 through valve
        704 by the upwards movement of the piston 702. In case cylinder
        701 had in it some oxygen, it is "trapped" on the filter 703. </p>
      <p>[0063] FIG. 7C illustrates the injection phase, in which a
        mixture of hydrogen and steam at moderate pressure, of typically
        10 Atm, are injected into the cylinder 701 through the steam
        injector 706, while valves 704 and 705 are closed. The steam
        releases the oxygen from the barium oxide filter, and the
        released oxygen reacts with the injected hydrogen to form water.
        The oxidation of hydrogen with oxygen is exothermic enough to
        turn all the water in the cylinder to steam, as the pressure and
        temperature raises to about 100 Atm and 1000 C. </p>
      <p>[0064] FIG. 7D illustrates the expansion tact, that may also be
        termed the work production cycle. The steam in the cylinder 701
        moves the piston 702 downwards (the valves 704 and 705 are still
        closed), such that the expansion ratio is about 1:100, and the
        steam approaches condensation. </p>
      <p>[0065] FIG. 7E illustrates the evacuation tact, in which
        upwards movement of piston 702 pushes the expanded steam through
        valve 705 (now opened) to a condenser (606 in FIG. 6), where it
        condenses to liquid water, and moves on to the reaction chamber
        602. </p>
      <p>[0066] FIG. 10 represents another heat machine 1000 in
        accordance with the present invention. The machine 1000 is an
        internal combustion reciprocating steam engine comprising a
        reactor 1002, connected to a metal source 1004 and to a water
        reservoir 1006, to allow the reaction of metal with water in the
        reactor. The reactor 1002 is also connected to a cylinder 1050,
        which is being connected to an oxygen source 1008 and to the
        water reservoir 1006, such that upon combustion of hydrogen with
        oxygen in the cylinder 1050 to produce steam, the steam expands
        to move a piston 1052, and leaves the cylinder back to the water
        reservoir 1006 through condenser contained therein. The said
        movement of the piston 1052 is used for producing useful energy,
        and the piston may then be brought back to its initial position
        against the pressure of the condensed water in the cylinder,
        which is very low. </p>
      <p>[0067] FIG. 11 illustrates a heat machine 1100 similar to that
        illustrated in FIG. 10, only here, lithium peroxide functions as
        a condensed phase source for oxygen. Then steam is produced via
        a heat exchanger (not shown) in the reaction chamber 1102 or in
        the water condenser of the water reservoir 1106 and allowed to
        enter to the oxygen source 1185, where lithium peroxide reacts
        with the steam to release oxygen, and the oxygen is pumped into
        the cylinder 1150, where it reacts with hydrogen coming in from
        the reactor 1102. </p>
      <p>[0068] FIG. 8 illustrates the relationships for the system BaO,
        BaO.sub.2, steam, and oxygen, at equilibrium, under pressure of
        10 atmospheres and starting with BaO.sub.2 and a 10 fold excess
        of steam. The X axis represents temperature (in .degree. C.),
        and the Y axis represents number of moles of each of the
        constituents of the system. </p>
      <p>[0069] FIG. 9 illustrates the relationships for the system
        BaO.sub.2, Ba(OH).sub.2, and O.sub.2, with excess oxygen,
        starting with Ba(OH).sub.2. The meaning of the X and Y axis are
        as in FIG. 8. </p>
      <p>[0070] The graphs of FIGS. 8 and 9 were obtained using the
        commercially available computer program Outokumpu HSC Chemistry
        for Windows 5.1. </p>
      <p>[0071] As may be inferred from FIG. 9, around 450.degree. C.
        the equilibrium conditions between barium oxide, barium
        hydroxide, oxygen and water are such that at excess water barium
        hydroxide and oxygen are formed, while at excess oxygen, barium
        peroxide and water are formed. This may be utilized to form
        oxygen and to regenerate barium peroxide according to some of
        the embodiments of the present invention. </p>
