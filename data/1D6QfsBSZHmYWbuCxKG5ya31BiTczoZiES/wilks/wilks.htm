        <p align="left">Huntington, WV (HNN) – Marshall University
          canceled classes Friday, Sept. 19 due to a power outage which
          blackened most of the campus. According to Appalachian Power,
          a failed splice in an underground substation caused the
          outage. </p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;Drinko Library, the Robert C Byrd
          Biotechnology Science Center and portions of Old Main remained
          open as they have backup generators. </p>
        <p align="left">The failure also impacted businesses at Pullman
          Square, where Five Guys and Starbucks had closed for the day.
          Empire Books had a check back at 5 p.m. sign on the door. </p>
        <p align="left">But all could have been open if they had the
          battery generator Power Wagon which debuted at the St. Joseph
          Grade School Carnival. Paul Wilks, the inventor of the gasless
          generator, has built a battery powered device which recharges
          by merely turning the wheels. </p>
        <p align="left">Charging from the torque of wheels rolling, the
          device runs lights, air conditioning, refrigerators, and even
          inflatable slides. </p>
        <p align="left">The noiseless device charges its batteries by
          attaching the trailer to the back of a vehicle --- or for that
          matter a horse and wagon.”It rolls itself,” explained Wilks,
          adding that it can provide power in remote settings, at
          construction sites, for emergency situations, or as a gasless
          alternative to power your home or office. 0A </p>
        <p align="left">Wilks, who once drove a truck, has been working
          on the invention about seven years. The idea came from seeing
          the wheels of trucks turn.” I started piecing it together
          seven or eight years ago. I did not know if I could make it
          work.” He envisioned capturing that energy as a substitute for
          gas. </p>
        <p align="left">Currently, only his family members and a judge
          have been utilizing the Power Wagon. </p>
        <p align="left">A federal judge approached Wilks three years ago
          after becoming dissatisfied with the noise and fumes of gas a
          generator on his boat. </p>
        <p align="left">“He had a generator on his boat and his family
          got sick,” Wilks explained. A friend steered the judge to
          Wilks invention. “I think what you got there should be on my
          boat,” Wilks said paraphrasing the jurist. “This is going on
          the third season and it’s still running his boat. He loves it.
          As soon as he got it put together, he got rid of his
          generator.” </p>
        <p align="left">John Howard, manager of M &amp; M Inflatables,
          Ironton, Ohio, ecstatically stated, “I’ve never seen anything
          like it before. We could take this places without electricity.
          It would be great for festivals; it’s not very loud. You can’t
          hear it run. It saves on gas; it would pay for itself in about
          a year’s time with us.” Speaking about a power failure a few w
          eeks ago in and around Newport/Covington, Ky., Wilks told
          Howard that the Power Wagon could have operated during the
          black out. Grinning, he said that his house would have been
          the only one with lights. </p>
        <p align="left">On lookers expressed amazement as the device
          powered machines at the St. Joe carnival. One individual
          foresaw the device as having a wide variety of military uses
          (such as providing power in Iraq) or as an asset for THEMA,
          which faces powerless disasters. Pointing to a set of
          generator powered lights which the carnival would utilize
          after dark, Wilks explained “you could put a light system on
          this that could light up just as much as those.” </p>
        <p align="left">Wilks indicated that a group of West Virginia
          University engineers have given a &amp;nbs p;thumbs up for the
          invention, for which a patent application is pending. “They
          said it needed to be on the market now,” the inventor said of
          the WVU examination of the gasless generator. </p>
        <p align="left">Asked often whether a car could be built to run
          on it, he grinned and shrugged favorably. But, that project
          would be too large for him. Still, many of those marveling at
          the device aptly described it as “the wave for the future.” </p>

          <b>Abstract </b>--&nbsp; A working surface incorporates a
          means for transferring mechanical energy produced by a
          rotating member of the working surface so that the energy
          rotates a shaft attached to an alternator that charges a bank
          of 12 V batteries. The alternator is responsible for
          converting the mechanical energy being input by the rotating
          shaft to electrical energy that is fed to the batteries. The
          batteries transfer the energy into an inverter for use
          depending upon the required amount. Thereby, backup electrical
          power may be generated and stored, taking advantage of excess
          horsepower at cruise provided by a vehicle as well as better
          utilizing travel time. Additionally, the added cost of
          ownership and noise of a portable power generator is avoided.

          of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p align="left"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">[0002] The present invention relates to
          electrical power generation and storage devices for portable
          or emergency use. While portable electrical generators are
          quite useful for emergency situations or austere environments,
          such generators tend to be inconvenient with regard to
          maintenance, transport, duration, and reliability.
          Consequently, a significant need exists for a more convenient
          and cheaper method of providing back-up electrical power. </p>
        <p align="left">[0003] Various kinds of portable generators
          exist in the current market. The uses for these generators
          range from home use to industrial use. Conventional portable
          generators comprise an engine and an alternator driven by the
          engine to produce electricity. Specifically, the spark-ignited
          combustion engine produces mechanical drive to rotate a
          crankshaft. The crankshaft, connected with a revolving shaft
          of the generator, will produce electrical current by
          converting the mechanical power produced by the engine into
          electrical energy. The mechanical energy drives the crankshaft
          to rotate electrically conductive elements within a magnetic
          field. The rotation of the electrically conductive elements
          around the field produces electric energy capable of being
          used or stored. </p>
        <p align="left">[0004] A more desirable form of energy storage
          is extremely valuable as a result of the continual rise of
          fuel prices, the concern for the environment, and the decline
          of the amount of fossil fuels. A portable power source that
          can produce electrical energy by converting mechanical energy
          would help reduce the cost of energy, protect the environment,
          and provide a reliable, convenient source of energy. The
          traditional portable electric generators consume gasoline to
          produce the mechanical drive necessary to rotate the
          electrically conductive elements. By contrast, using a
          rotating axle coupled with a gear system or other means would
          provide the necessary mechanical drive to produce electrical
          energy as opposed to wasting other energy sources and
          utilizing a portion of the power of a vehicle that would
          otherwise be unused. </p>
        <p align="left">[0005] A more efficient approach as stated
          earlier would be to use a mechanical drive system already
          being used, such as the wheel axle of a towed vehicle or a
          drive system of a car, to effectuate the rotation of the shaft
          of an alternator. This rotation of the shaft by means
          including but not limited to gears, pulleys, and transmissions
          will produce electric power capable of being stored within a
          single battery or a series of batteries. The power may then be
          converted by an inverter from direct current to alternating
          current as desired by the user. </p>

        <p align="left"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE
            INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">[0011] Referring now to the drawings in detail,
          wherein like numerals indicate the same elements throughout
          the views, FIGS. 1-4 show the apparatus comprising a towable
          working surface depicted as a single-axle trailer 10 that
          advantageously incorporates a wheel-driven electrical power
          generation and storage system 12 such that when being pulled
          by a vehicle 14, a driver may monitor an emergency power
          supply status display 16 attached to a dashboard 18. A wired
          or wireless connection 20 back to a trailer portion 22 of the
          system 12 communicates whether the wheel speed is within an
          optimum range for power generation and a level of stored
          charge of the system 12. </p>
        <p align="left">[0012] The trailer portion includes a generally
          known trailer 24 that has a lower deck 26 upon which a
          plurality of electrical power storage components (e.g.,
          chemical batteries) 28 are supported. A table portion 30 is
          mounted overtop of the lower deck 26 to encompass the
          batteries 28 and to provide a work surface 32 so that the
          trailer portion 22 may serve additional purposes rather than
          merely generating and storing electrical power. In particular,
          an inverter box 34 may be stowed on a front hitch portion 36
          of the trailer 24 as in FIG. 2 or on a mid section receptacle
          38 as depicted in FIG. 1 to provide a weather protected
          container for an inverter 40 (FIG. 4) that converts the charge
          to an alternating current (e.g., single phase 110 V) that may
          power tools or household appliances when emergency or portable
          power is required. </p>
        <p align="left">[0013] With particular reference to FIG. 3, the
          system 12 includes a rotating member (axle) 42 turned by
          wheels 43, which is coupled to a transmission member 44 and
          rotates a shaft 46 attached to an alternator 13 positioned by
          a mount 50. The rotation of the shaft 46 forces the alternator
          48 to produce electric power by rotating electrically
          conductive elements within a magnetic field. The electric
          power produced by the alternator 48 may then be sent to one or
          more batteries 28 and ultimately converted by the inverter 40
          from direct current ("DC") to alternating current ("AC"). </p>
        <p align="left">[0014] The rotating member 42 provides the force
          that drives the shaft 46 attached to the alternator 40. In the
          illustrated version, the rotating member 42 is a wheel axle.
          Additionally, the rotating member 42 could be an object
          converting wind forces opposing the movement of the working
          surface 1 to produce rotation of the shaft 15. Other rotating
          surfaces may be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the
          art. One such system could incorporate a drive shaft in the
          vehicle to produce the movement necessary of the inverter 13.
        </p>
        <p align="left">[0015] The means for transferring the drive
          produced by the rotating member 6 to rotate the shaft 46
          attached to the alternator 13 may encompass a range of
          transmissions, gears, or any other system apparent to those of
          ordinary skill in the art. In the illustrative version of FIG.
          3, a ring 52 and pinion gear 54 of the axle 42 attached to the
          trailer 10 may be joined with a pulley system 56 to transfer
          the drive produced by the axle 42 to the shaft 46. A universal
          joint (not shown) that is typically attached to the pinion 9
          is removed and replaced with the pulley system 56. As
          illustrated in FIG. 3, the pulley system 56 is depicted as a
          double v-belt comprising a rotating cylinder 58 connected to
          the pinion 54, a second rotating cylinder 60 and a belt 62.
          The rotation of cylinder 58 is driven by the pinion 54. The
          belt 62 attached to cylinder 58, rotates the second cylinder
          58. Differing numbers of pulleys and gears may be used to
          accomplish the goal to produce the necessary means to transfer
          the force produced by the pinion 54 to the shaft 46. The
          pulley system 56 may advantageously serve as a ratio reducer
          or multiplier to maintain the shaft 46 within an optimum
          rotation range. </p>
        <p align="left">[0016] The alternator 48 converts the mechanical
          energy produced by the rotation of the shaft 46 into
          electrical energy. The availability of many different
          alternators 48 provides that alternators 48 may be substituted
          or varied depending upon their size and specifications. As
          seen in FIG. 3, the alternator 48 may be positioned adjacent
          to the v-belt pulley system 56. The alternator 48 should have
          a positive and negative terminal. The alternator 48 will then
          electrically connect to one or more batteries 28 to transfer
          and store the energy produced by the rotation of shaft 46. </p>
        <p align="left">[0017] While FIG. 4 represents a diagram of four
          batteries 28, there is no specific number of batteries
          required to operate the apparatus. The figures only illustrate
          one possible layout using four batteries 28. FIG. 4 represents
          one setup with wiring connections (battery cables) 64 for
          achieving the energy storage. Specifically, FIG. 4 depicts the
          use of four "8-D" batteries mounted on the trailer 10. Two #4
          AWG watt battery cables 64 are attached to each battery 28.
          The alternator 48 should be wired to connect to a positive
          terminal of a battery 28. A ground wire should run from the
          alternator 48 to the remaining negative terminal of the
          battery 28. The type and number of batteries 28 will vary
          according to the application. </p>
        <p align="left">[0018] Positive and negative terminals of the
          series/parallel combination of batteries 28 connect to the
          inverter 40. The inverter 40 converts the direct current into
          alternating current ("AC"). The illustrative version is a 30
          A. (110 AC) inverter 40 that provides AC through a 30 A outlet
          or surge protector up to a total of 30 A due to the 30 A
          inverter. Additionally, one may choose to install a voltage
          regulator 66 that regulates the current going out of the
          alternator 40 in order to avoid overcharging the batteries 28.
          The voltage regulator 66 would force the rotating member
          (axle) 42, a ring 52 and pinion rear end gear 54 as seen in
          FIG. 3, to obtain a certain speed before activating the
          alternator 40. If the desired speed is not met, the batteries
          28 may not charge. </p>
