      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A system and method of aeroponic farming includes depositing
      seeds in a flat containing micro-fleece cloth and placing the flat
      within a growth chamber. The upper side of the flat is subjected
      to light of the proper frequencies to promote growth in plants. A
      nutrient solution is sprayed onto the micro-fleece cloth and the
      developing root mass of the plants, while controlling temperature,
      humidity, and carbon dioxide within the growth chamber. The plants
      are harvested resulting from the seeds at a desired stage of
      growth. The growth chambers can be stacked on each other and/or
      located side by side to save space within a facility, and to
      permit sharing the subsystems which control the nutrient solution,
      temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide for the growth chambers.<br>

      The device may include a first light source that emits a main
      growth spectrum, a second light source that emits an altering
      spectrum; and means of directing the first and second light source
      to a group of cells, wherein the altering spectrum alters the
      biochrome content of a group of cells to create a desired pattern
      on a leaf. Methods of altering the biochrome ratio in a group of
      cells on a leaf generally involve aligning a surface of a leaf
      with a light source, activating the light source to produce an
      altering spectrum, and directing the altering spectrum towards the
      leaf to create a pattern, wherein cells of the leaf exposed to the

      Exemplary embodiments are directed to an improvement of an
      aeroponic system including a growth chamber and cloth support
      elements. The improvement generally includes a cloth supported by
      the cloth support elements. The cloth advantageously satisfies a
      wicking height parameter and an absorbance parameter so as to
      deliver advantageous aeroponic performance. The wicking height
      parameter is a measurement of an ability of the cloth or fabric to
      absorb moisture. The absorbance parameter is a measurement of
      moisture the cloth or fabric retains. Exemplary methods of
      aeroponic farming in an aeroponic system are also provided.<br>

      forced up into the second reservoir by compressed gas for

      several weeks, whereupon the treatment substantially reduces
      weight loss and decay during the storage period. The fog may
