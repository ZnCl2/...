      Veti-gel is a veterinary product, a plant-derived gel that is
      claimed to quickly stop traumatic bleeding on external and
      internal wounds. It uses a plant-based haemophilic polymer made
      from polysaccharides that forms a mesh that seals the wound.[1] It
      is manufactured by Suneris Inc, an American biotechnology company,
      which is also exploring human products derived from its
      technology, slated to launch as early as 2016.[2] The company
      plans on releasing a product for the military and the emergency
      medicine market first, followed by a product for the human
      surgical market when FDA approval is granted.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Suneris, Inc. is headquartered in Brooklyn, New York City, United
      States. The company was founded in 2010 by Joe Landolina and Isaac
      Miller, while they were students at NYU Poly.[4][5] Suneris
      focuses on wound care products, specifically those in the field of
      hemostasis. The company operates out of a 2500 sq. ft. animal
      health manufacturing facility located in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[6]<br>

      A graduate from Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU)
      has invented a gel that can stop bleeding and seal serious wounds
      in just 15 seconds, and hopes his invention will soon be used by
      the military, paramedics and even vets to save lives.<br>
      <br>
      Vetigel works by using a plant-based haemophilic polymer made from
      polysaccharides that grab onto the blood and form a mesh that
      seals over the wound, without any need to apply pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In a medical emergency, a first responder could simply apply the
      gel from a syringe-shaped applicator with no preparation required,
      and the bleeding will stop, which means that this could be a
      viable replacement for plasters and bandages today.<br>
      <br>
      The gel is the brainchild of Joe Landolina, 21, the founder and
      CEO of Suneris, who came up with the concept when he was just 17
      in 2010.<br>
      <br>
      "I was always interested in science and my grandfather owned a
      winery, so from a really young age I learned how to work in a
      chemistry lab and had a love for chemistry," he told IBTimes UK.<br>
      <br>
      "As I was playing around, I stumbled upon two polymers that when
      you mix them together, they become a solid mass. That was the
      Eureka moment for me."<br>
      Working on his invention after school<br>
      <br>
      Landolina started a combined Undergraduate and Masters degree in
      chemical engineering and biomedical engineering with NYU a year
      later, but while many of his peers were enjoying being away from
      home and getting into university life, Landolina was working on
      building a startup company.<br>
      <br>
      "I initially started with just classmates, but in the end it took
      four years of research, hiring PHD [researchers] and getting lots
      of lab equipment in to test and develop the product," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "I did it after school and sometimes I even had to skip classes."<br>
      <br>
      Luckily Landolina was supported by his university. In 2011, he
      took both the first prize in a competition held by NYU's
      engineering school, as well as second prize in another competition
      held by the business school.<br>
      <br>
      From these two competitions he won $5,000 (£3,187) – just enough
      to start working on his idea, while his university mentored him
      with coaching on how to start a business and tried to help find
      private investors.<br>

      private investors.<br>
      <br>
      Today, Vetigel is still two years away from getting FDA approval
      to distribute the product in the US, so he is going down the
      veterinary route first.<br>
      <br>
      "One of my very first employees was affiliated to the New York
      Aquarium, where they had lost an animal due to bleeding," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Veterinarians have almost no time to stop the bleeding before an
      animal dies. There's no product [to help], and there's a huge need
      for it in the market."<br>
      <br>
      There are also less regulatory hurdles into getting into the
      market, and essentially Vetigel is ready to be launched, but
      Landolina wants to make sure that his manufacturing facilities are
      properly set up before putting out the product.<br>
      Getting Vetigel to market<br>
      <br>
      The veterinary version of Vetigel will hopefully be available from
      early 2015 in the US and UK, followed by Europe, Asia, Australia
      and Africa.<br>
      <br>
      Early estimates show that each application of the gel will roughly
      cost about $30 per application.<br>
      <br>
      For the first FDA approval, Vetigel will need to be removed by a
      doctor or surgeon and the wound will need to be stitched up or
      treated the usual way in a hospital, but Landolina is also working
      on a version of the gel that can be left in the body and absorbed
      over time as the body's natural healing process takes place.<br>
      <br>
      "For the veterinary field, the product is meant to be used
      internally. If you were to put it on the liver, within two weeks
      it would be absorbed into the organ," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "It depends on where you put the product, but the technology is
      such that once you put it on, the clot will not reopen."<br>

          <b>IN-SITU CROSS-LINKABLE POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS
            THEREOF</b><br>
        </big><br>
      </div>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LANDOLINA JOSEPH A [US] +<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A biocompatible polymeric composition for cross-linking in-situ in
      a wound is disclosed comprising 1) one or more polyanionic
      polymers such as alginates or hyaluronates, able to be
      cross-linked the surface of the wound and 2) one or more
      polycationic polymers such as chitosan or DEAE-Dextran, that
      assists in the solidification process as well as speeds up
      hemostasis without the need for applying pressure. The
      biocompatible polymeric composition may further comprise a
      cross-linking agent such as aqueous calcium chloride. The
      invention encompasses an initial polymeric composition, the
      solidified matrix cross-linked and integrated at the wound site,
      including the methods of using, applying, and cross-linking the
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to a composition
      using a biocompatible polymeric formulation and, in particular, to
      a hemophilic polymeric matrix for use in wound healing, blood
      coagulation, and cosmetic use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Wound healing is an intricate, orchestrated process
      involving the interactions of various cells and matrix components
      to first establish a provisional tissue and then remodel this
      while forming the mature replacement. Initially, the hemostatic
      platelet plug reestablishes the infection-limiting and
      desiccation-limiting barrier, and elicits the first wave of
      cellular infiltrates. This consists mainly of leukocytes that
      provide both innate and acquired immunity. These cells produce
      enzymes and biocidal molecules to eliminate microbial
      contamination; however, these same defense mechanisms are
      detrimental to the keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial
      cells required to regenerate the lost tissue. Thus, as healing
      proceeds, the events and processes of the inflammatory phase need
      to regress.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] A particular challenge is offered in the case of skin wound
      repair, which occurs at a contaminated surface. If a wound becomes
      infected, the normal healing is disrupted as the inflammatory
      phase becomes chronic, suppressing the regenerative phase.
      Further, the enzymes liberated by both the microbes and leukocytes
      break down the wound tissue as well as surrounding skin. Thus, it
      is critical to ensure proper healing to prevent infections being
      established by normal skin wound contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Wound healing is usually divided into three phases: the
      inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the remodeling
      phase. Fibronectin has been reported to be involved in each stage
      of the wound healing process, particularly by creating a scaffold
      to which the invading cells will adhere. Initially, there is a
      release of many mediators to the wound site, such as fibronectin
      and fibrinogen. Fibronectin promotes inflammatory cell migration
      into the wound and debris phagocytosis by monocytes. Thereafter,
      angiogenesis and reepithelialization take place. At this stage,
      fibronectin exerts chemotactic activity on endothelial cells, and
      promotes epithelial cell and fibroblast migration onto the basal
      membrane. Fibronectin also appears to be essential in the
      remodeling phase where it plays a major role in the organization
      of collagen fibrils. The fibrillar collagen ultimately forms
      fibrous bundles that enhance the tissue tensile strength, leading
      to would closure.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydrogels have typically been utilized as topical
      formulations for promoting the wound healing process. The gel
      compositions have been selected for their properties of swelling
      degree, biocompatibility, permeability, and swelling kinetics.
      Examples of such compounds have included vinyl polymers (e.g.
      polyacrylic acid), cellulose, and cellulose derivatives.
      Polyacrylic acid polymer, also referred to as carbomer, has been
      used because of its superiority in delivering fibronectin to skin
      wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Naturally occurring biopolymers have applications in tissue
      engineering, regenerative medicine, drug delivery, medical
      implant, plastic surgery, and others. Such products have
      components including hyaluronic acid (HA), chitosan, heparin,
      chondroitin sulfate, alginate and other glucosamine and
      glycosaminoglycans, other polysaccharides, and derivatives
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In combination, concentrations of fibronectin (and similar
      proteins) have been utilized with alginate salt to treat chronic
      ulcers. The dressing system has been solidified, converting the
      gel into fibers, by a process of freeze-drying. This procedure
      creates a sponge-like structure with hydrophilic properties. In
      the presence of fluids, the dressings can return to a gel-like
      state, absorbing up to 20 times their weight in wound exudate. The
      dressing is easily removed after the wound treatment because of
      its sponge-like structure and moisture retention. However, once
      hydrated with saline solution, the fibronectin-cellulose dressing
      does not provide the desired fibrous protective film on the
      surface of the deepithelialized human skin. Debridement is then
      performed upon removal of the dressing to remove any necrotic
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Thus, problems exist in the treatment of acute and chronic
      wounds, including delayed healing, reduced granulation and
      epithelialization, and persistent wound inflammation. Compromised
      wound healing can result in other complications and problems, such
      as infection, pain, and development of chronic (non-healing)
      wounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Current needs exist in the treatment of chronic wounds
      which would assist healing, decrease inflammation, reduce pain,
      and prevent scar formation with both acute and chronic wounds.
      Such acute wounds that could be treated include burns, abrasions,
      dry skin, post-op surgical incisions, cuts, puncture wounds,
      blisters, insect bites, and other severe tissue injury. Chronic
      wound treatment might encompass slow to heal wounds including
      pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, decubitus
      ulcers, and non-healing tissue injuries.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Overall, a composition is desired that will be easily
      applied, forming a matrix conducive to the healing of a tissue,
      and having anti-microbial properties. The composition may be
      biocompatible or quickly reacted to avoid possibilities of
      cytotoxicity. Further, the composition will stimulate and maximize
      wound healing while providing a controlled method for providing
      thin and thick layers of a solidified wound dressing, as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Indirect effects may include reduced need for medical
      procedures such as debridement, decreased hospitalization time,
      reduced postoperative recovery times, shortened return interval to
      daily functions and work, and reduced overall treatment costs.
      Desirably, these improvements to wound healing, including
      application and method of use, will be valuable in treating and
      repairing various tissue(s).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0013] The following invention is a biocompatible polymeric
      composition that is a gelatinous wound healing and hemostatic
      matrix able to be formed and solidified both internally and
      externally.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In one embodiment of the invention, the biocompatible
      polymeric composition comprises 1) one or more than one

      [0017] One or more methods of using the medical gel of the
      invention are also disclosed, including rapidly achieving
      hemostasis without the need to apply pressure, and providing a
      biocompatible wound healing matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Various embodiments of the invention allow the formulation
      to be adjusted and implemented for varying the desired viscosity
      and pre-determined characteristic functions. In one aspect, the
      ratio of the polycationic polymer to the polyanionic polymer may
      be improved, having varying degrees of efficiency in wound
      healing. In another aspect, therapeutics can be added to integrate
      drug formulations for drug delivery options. Further, other
      features may encompass controlling temperature(s) and/or
      pressure(s) during the preparation of the medical gel, during
      application of the gel, and implementing a control for the
      elasticity or rigidity of the solidified matrix. The matrix
      formulation, both liquid and solidified structures, may also be
      dependent on anatomical and physiological measurements and
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Various embodiments of the invention allow the composition
      to be adjusted and implemented at a first tissue site or a second
      tissue site, and such modification deemed obvious may be
      integrated and combined in varying quantities to provide for a
      structural matrix of any size, shape, and configuration.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0024] In the following detailed description, for purposes of
      explanation and not limitation, exemplary embodiments disclosing
      specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough
      understanding of the present invention. However, it will be
      apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that the present
      invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from
      the specific details disclosed herein. In other instances,
      detailed descriptions of well-known compositions and methods may
      be omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Biocompatible polymeric compositions of the present
      invention may be used to treat external wounds as well as internal
      wounds. In one embodiment of the invention, the biocompatible
      polymeric composition may be applied to a variety of wounds.
      Non-limiting examples of wounds include, but are not limited to:
      an external laceration, an abrasion, a burn, an ocular laceration,
      damage to a parenchymal organ, an internal laceration, a
      laceration in the gastrointestinal tract, superficial cuts and
      scrapes, internal bleeding, an arterial bleed, a venous bleed,
      dental or oral bleeds and incisions. Subjects who can benefit from
      such wound treatment include a variety of animals including
      humans, mammals such as horses, sheep, cattle, hogs, dogs, cats,
      and marine animals such as whales, dolphins, seals, otters, fish,
      and reptiles such as turtles.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] An illustration of a structural matrix in accordance with
      one embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 1. As depicted, a
      damaged section of tissue, wound (112), has vasculature (116)
      protruding throughout. A biocompatible polymeric composition (114)
      has been applied to the wound (112), which has been coated with
      protective coat (110).<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 2 shows a magnified view of one embodiment of
      biocompatible polymeric composition (114), which comprises
      structural polymer (226) and hemophilic polymer (224). Structural
      polymer (226) comprises about 0.1% to 95% by total composition
      weight of a cross-linkable polyanionic polymer and 0% to 95% by
      total composition weight of a non-cross-linkable polyanionic
      polymer. Hemophilic polymer (224) comprises about 1% to 90% by
      total composition weight of a polycationic polymer. Red blood cell
      (210) is shown in relation to the cationic function groups (212)
      via a red blood cell-cationic group linkage (216).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIGS. 3A to 3I show various polymers that can be chosen as
      structural polymer (226) or hemophilic polymer (224). Polymers can
      be modified through the addition of carboxymethyl (CM) groups to
      gain anionic functional groups (218). FIG. 3E shows carboxymethyl
      cellulose. Alginate (3A), sodium hyaluronate (3F), ?-carrageenan
      (3G), t-carrageenan (3H), and sodium polyacrylate (3I) are
      examples of polymers that would function as structural polymer
      (226). Likewise, chitin (3B) and chitosan (3C) are examples of
      polymers that would function as hemophilic polymer (224). FIG. 3D
      shows how any polymer (340) can be modified with a
      diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) group to gain cationic functional groups
      (212).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Biocompatible polymeric composition (114) contains about
      0.1% to 99.8% by total composition weight of a solvent. In one
      embodiment of the invention, the solvent is ethanol. Preferably
      the solvent is a 5% aqueous solution of ethanol in water.
      Non-limiting examples of solvents include water, ethanol, amyl
      acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, isopropanol, and
      tetrahydrofuran. In solution, structural polymer (226) and
      hemophilic polymer (224) experience intermolecular interactions
      which bind them together. Cationic function groups (212) on
      hemophilic polymer (224) attract anionic functional groups (218)
      on structural polymer (226) and result in ionic cross-linking
      (214). Additionally, hemophilic polymer (224) and structural
      polymer (226) can be covalently cross-linked (228), similar to a
      Schiff base or azomethine linkage.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Protective coat (110) comprises 0.1% to 30% by weight of a
      di- or higher valent cation (220), 0% to 90% by weight of a
      hydrophobic polymer, and 5% to 99.9% by weight of a solvent.
      Protective coat (110) cross-links composition (114) by diffusing
      divalent cation (220) inwards, which results in divalent cation
      cross-linking (222) of structural polymer (226). This increases
      the rigidity of composition (114) and allows for better stability.
      Protective coat (110) can also contain hydrophobic polymers, which
      limit the water loss from composition (114) and improve
      durability. The hydrophobic polymer may be a polyurethane,
      nitrocellulose, a cyanoacrylate, a styrene, a
      polytetrafluoroethane, and a silicone, and combinations thereof.
      The solvent may be water, amyl acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl
      ketone, isopropanol, and tetrahydrofuran, and combinations
      thereof. The di- or higher valent cation may be Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+,
      Ag2+, Ag3+, Au2+, Au3+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Cu3+, and Zn2+. In one
      embodiment of the invention, the cation is Ca2+.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one embodiment of the invention, structural polymer
      (226) comprises 0.1% to 5% by weight of sodium alginate and 1% to
      5% by weight of sodium hyaluronate, hemophilic polymer (224)
      comprises 2% to 25% by weight of chitosan chloride, and the
      solvent comprises 65% to 96.9% by weight of a 5% aqueous solution
      of ethanol in water. In this embodiment, the composition functions
      as a wound healing matrix to facilitate faster tissue
      regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In another embodiment, structural polymer (226) comprises
      2% to 5% by weight of sodium alginate and 0% to 2% by weight of
      sodium hyaluronate, hemophilic polymer (224) comprises 5% to 20%
      by weight of chitosan chloride, and the solvent comprises 73% to
      93% by weight of a 5% aqueous solution of ethanol in water. In
      this embodiment, the composition functions as a thick gel for
      rapidly achieving hemostasis without the need to apply pressure.
      The composition can be delivered topically to the compromised
      blood vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In another embodiment of the invention, structural polymer
      (226) comprises 0.1% to 4% by weight of sodium alginate and 1% to
      5% by weight of a lysine-rich polypeptide, hemophilic polymer
      (224) comprises 5% to 25% by weight of diethylaminoethyl-dextran
      (DEAE-Dextran), and the solvent comprises 65% to 93% by weight of
      a 5% aqueous solution of ethanol in water. The biocompatible
      polymeric composite (114) is then cross-linked in situ by applying
      an aerosol mist comprising 0.1% to 1% by weight of calcium
      chloride, 1% to 5% by weight of nitrocellulose, and 94% to 98.9%
      by weight of amyl acetate. In this embodiment, the composition
      functions as a protective covering for cuts and scrapes that is
      durable and limits water loss from the wound.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment of the invention, the biocompatible
      polymeric composition comprises about 3.6% by weight of sodium
      alginate, about 7% by weight of chitosan chloride, and about 89.4%
      by weight of a 5% aqueous solution of ethanol in water. This
      embodiment may function as a composition to treat arterial bleeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one embodiment of the invention, the protective coat
      comprises a solution comprising about 0.1% to about 30% by weight
      of a di- or higher valent cation; 0% to about 90% by weight of a
      hydrophobic polymer; and about 5% to about 99.9% by weight of a
      solvent. In one embodiment of the invention, the protective coat
      comprises a solution comprising about 0.1% to about 1% by weight
      of a di-valent cation; about 1 to about 5% by weight of a
      hydrophobic polymer; and about 94% to about 98.9% by weight of a
      solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In one embodiment of the invention, composition (114) is
      used as a carrier for a therapeutic agent such as a drug or
      biologic molecule. The use of composition (114) as a drug delivery
      system improves the efficiency of the wound healing gel. In one
      aspect, protective coat (110) is prepared with a salt of silver,
      increasing the antimicrobial properties of the gel. In one
      embodiment, the therapeutic agent is selected from the group
      consisting of: antimicrobial agents, antibiotics, hormones,
      proteins (such as calreticulin, thrombin, prothrombin, Factor
      VIII), and iodine, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment of
      the invention, the therapeutic agent is preferably iodine. In
      another embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic agent is a
      protein.<br>

      <br>

      <br>

      5% by weight of the biocompatible polymeric composition;
      preferably the non-cross-linkable polyanionic polymer comprises
      about 0 to about 2% by weight of the biocompatible polymeric
      composition; preferably the non-cross-linkable polyanionic polymer
      comprises about 1 to about 5% by weight of the biocompatible
      polymeric composition.<br>
      <br>

      composition may be stored in a variety of different containers for
      a variety of different applications, including for example,

      any site or location external and/or internal to the body.
      Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the
      following claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Further, the studies described may utilize one embodiment
      of the composition to form a rigid matrix while another
      composition may be designed with an increased elasticity, alone or
      in combination. Further, the methods of mixing and formulating the
      composition may be performed in any order and combination so as to
      achieve the same or similar effects of the embedded solidified
      matrix, the matrix integrating the formation of naturally
      restructuring tissue. In one embodiment, the one or more than one
      polyanionic polymer is first applied to a wound and then the one
      or more than one polycationic polymer is applied to the said one
      or more than one polymeric polymer at the wound site. In one
      embodiment, the one or more than one polyanionic polymer is mixed
      with the one or more than one polycationic polymer and then the
      mixture is then applied to the wound. In one embodiment, the one
      or more than one polyanionic polymer is applied to a wound at the

      <br>
      [0047] In one embodiment, a method of treating a wound comprises
      applying one or more than one polyanionic polymer to a wound and
      then applying one or more than one polycationic polymer to the
      said one or more than one polymeric polymer at the wound site. In
      one embodiment, a method of treating a wound comprises mixing one
      or more than one polyanionic polymer with one or more than one
      polycationic polymer and then applying the mixture to the wound.
      In one embodiment, a method of treating a wound comprises applying
      one or more than one polyanionic polymer to the wound at the same
      time, or about the same time, as one or more than one polycationic
      polymer is applied to a wound.<br>

      It looks like scientists have discovered how to suck bacteria
      right out of a wound, in what may be one of the biggest medical
      advancements for those of us who are prone to accidents. While we
      have ointments that help quell the bacteria after a scratch or
      puncture, and bandages that keep other bacteria from getting into
      fresh wounds, this new material would allow for an all-in-one
      binding. It doesn’t just apply a topical cream to your cut, but in
      fact pulls the bacteria right out of it...<br>
