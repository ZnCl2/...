      <p>&nbsp;Light from a full moon is reflected off the 'Interstellar
        Light Collector' (R) onto people in a moveable trailer (small
        lighted object in center of photo) in the Sonoran desert near
        Three <br>
        &nbsp;Points, Nov. 23, 2007. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Financial advisor Jaron Ness stands in the cool desert
        air waiting for the clouds to clear and the moon to rise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;As the conditions come into alignment, he steps into the
        path of a cool blaze of blue-white light bounced off a wall of
        highly polished parabolic mirrors five stories high. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"It feels magnetic," he says, turning his hands slowly in
        the reflected glow of the light from the almost full moon. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The young professional from Colorado is among a growing
        number of curious people beating a path to this patch of
        scrub-strewn land out in the Arizona desert to bask in light
        from the <br>
        &nbsp;world's first moonbeam collector. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;A Tucson-based inventor and businessman Richard Chapin
        and his wife Monica are behind the giant device, which gathers
        up and focuses the light of the moon. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The effect of the moon's gravitational pull on the
        Earth's tides and other natural phenomena has been studied for
        millennia. Less attention has focused on the sunlight reflected
        from its surface. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The Chapins built the large, one-of-a-kind contraption
        that stands in the desert some 15 miles west of Tucson, Arizona,
        in the belief that moonlight might have applications for
        medicine, <br>
        &nbsp;industry and agriculture. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"So much work has focused on the sun. We have just
        forgotten about this great object that has been here for
        billions of years, has affected us in all forms of our
        evolution," said Chapin, who <br>
        &nbsp;paid for the project with his own money. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"If it could affect plants and animals ... I thought,
        'what could the amplification of that light do?"' </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;BATHING IN MOONLIGHT</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Neither of the Chapins are scientists. The couple used
        income from a popular swap meet they own in Tucson to develop
        what they call their "Interstellar Light Collector," which has
        so far <br>
        &nbsp;cost them $2 million. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It consists of a large frame sunk into a 45-foot-deep
        crater, on private land in sparse desert, in an area known for
        its dark skies a few miles from the Kitt Peak National
        Observatory. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The device is five stories tall and weighs 25 tons, and
        is covered with 84 mirrored panels set on a hydraulic mount
        that, the Chapins say, can focus the light of the moon with "the
        precision <br>
        &nbsp;of a Swiss watch." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;There is no charge to use the facility, although the
        couple accept donations of $10 from people who use it to defray
        some of the operating costs. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;So far they have had more than 1,000 visitors, with
        interest from as far a field as Australia, Japan, India and
        Saudi Arabia from people seeking either a new experience or in
        the hope of <br>
        &nbsp;some kind of medical benefit. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Some dress in robes, others strip to their underwear to
        bask in the moon glow from the glittering bank of mirrors,
        spending anywhere from three minutes to 15 minutes at a time. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Visitors enjoy the experience. Some say it is like
        swimming underwater, while others say it feels like standing in
        a warm breeze and leaves them feeling upbeat. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"When I got in the moonlight it was an instant and
        profound sense of euphoria ... it was very peaceful," said Eric
        Carr, a hypnotherapist from Tucson who has visited several
        times. </p>
      <p><b>BENEFITS OF LIGHT</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Some visitors to the site believe that exposure to the
        moonlight has helped alleviate some medical conditions. After
        bathing in the moonbeams, Carr said he noticed an improvement in
        a <br>
        &nbsp;long-standing asthma condition. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;However, no clinical experiments with moonlight have been
        carried out on people. Scientists say there is no proof that it
        has any effect whatsoever on medical conditions and diseases,
        and <br>
        &nbsp;are skeptical of anecdotal claims. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"I haven't seen any hard scientific evidence that it's
        not a placebo effect. There hasn't been enough real research on
        it yet to say that it's doing anything," said Katherine Creath,
        research <br>
        &nbsp;professor of optical sciences and medicine at the
        University of Arizona. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"But whether or not it's the placebo effect or the light,
        I don't think that matters as long as people feel like they are
        having a positive effect, then it's worth it to them to do it,"
        she added. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The Chapins are eager for researchers to use the site to
        determine if moonlight does have any demonstrable applications
        in areas including medicine, plant biology and certain
        industrial <br>
        &nbsp;processes. They also welcome visits by skeptics to the
        site. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, visitors continue to trek out to the imposing
        installation and listen to ambient music as they wait for a
        break in the clouds to step into the moonlight. For them, it is
        a very <br>
        &nbsp;enjoyable experience in itself. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"You feel almost like you are in heaven," said Aranka
        Toniatti, a cancer patient who has driven from Colorado twice to
        stand in the moonlight. "It's a gorgeous feeling." </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The invention is directed generally to devices and
        methods for collecting and concentrating light emanating from
        outer space and celestial bodies, including, but not limited to,
        stars, planets, moons, and comets. More specifically, the
        invention involves interstellar light collection apparatus and
        methods for collection, selection of component wavelengths
        (e.g., through dispersion), and application of interstellar
        light to matter for investigative purposes. </p>
      <p><b>[0003] 2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] Since the dawn of time, "light" (i.e., the
        electromagnetic spectrum) has been instrumental in everything
        from photosynthesis to modern photography. Solar light has been
        harnessed in photovoltaic cells to create electricity, light has
        been manufactured artificially to promote plant growth, and even
        non-visible light has been used in various medical applications
        such as X-rays and tumor detection devices. </p>
      <p>[0005] Indeed, a large quantity of background reading is
        available on the subject of the industrial and medical
        application of light (see, for example, National Research
        Council, Harnessing Light. Optical Science and Engineering for
        the 21.sup.st Century, National Academy Press, 1998; Kaler,
        James B., Stars and Their Spectra: An Introduction to the
        Spectral Sequence, Cambridge University Press, 1989; Scranton,
        Bowman, &amp; Peiffer, Editors, Photopolymerization:
        Fundamentals and Applications, American Chemical Society, 1996;
        and Kalyanasundaram &amp; Gratzel, Photosensitization and
        Photocatalysis Using Inorganic and Organometallic Compounds,
        Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993). </p>
      <p>[0006] Current technologies for collecting celestial light
        involve the use of "light buckets," i.e., optical receiving
        telescopes that collect photons but are not diffraction limited.
        In other words, a light bucket cannot concentrate photons into a
        very small tightly focused spot. </p>
      <p>[0007] Accordingly, light bucket technologies are hampered by
        the inability to concentrate light as would be useful in various
        methods of application, such as lasers. Moreover, traditional
        telescopes do not provide a means for dispersing focused light
        into component spectra for industrial or medical experimentation
        and application. </p>
      <p>[0008] Thus, there exists a need for methods and devices for
        improved collecting, concentrating, and dispersing celestial
        light. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0009] The invention relates in general to devices and methods
        for celestial light collection, concentration, and application.
        More specifically, the invention includes devices and methods
        for collecting, concentrating, and separating celestial light of
        different wavelengths and frequencies by utilizing a collection
        mirror and a means for dispersion located at a focal point. </p>
      <p>[0010] It is the intended use of the inventive device to
        collect and harness interstellar light in order to utilize the
        uniqueness of its spectra for the benefit of humankind through
        various applications. Hence, the invention will collect, harness
        and apply the spectrums and intensities of the stars and other
        celestial bodies, which are notably different from the spectrum
        of the sun, and furthermore cannot be duplicated anywhere on
        earth. </p>
      <p>[0011] This invention builds upon the principles and technology
        of basic telescopes. Instead of merely looking upon celestial
        bodies from earth, the present invention collects and
        concentrates light from celestial bodies down from the heavens
        and separates that light into various spectrums. </p>
      <p>[0012] In one embodiment, the inventive method includes the
        steps of collecting light from a celestial source by utilizing a
        mirror, focusing the light collected by the mirror to a focal
        point, dispersing the focused light utilizing an aperture
        located at the focal point, and exposing terrestrial matter to
        at least a portion of the dispersed light. </p>
      <p>[0013] Thus, it is a primary objective of the invention to
        provide a celestial light collector for concentrating and
        selecting light from celestial sources. </p>
      <p>[0014] Another embodiment of the invention relates to a
        celestial light collector that includes a mirror, a focus cage
        disposed along a focal axis of the mirror, and a means for
        dispersing celestial light reflected by the mirror, wherein the
        means for dispersing is located along the focal axis and housed
        within the focus cage. </p>
      <p>[0015] In another embodiment of the invention, a fresnel lens
        adapted to refract celestial light within a focus cage is
        utilized as, or in addition to, the means for dispersing.
        Alternatively, the means for dispersing light includes a lens
        between 0.5 and 8 millimeters in thickness or a prism. </p>
      <p>[0016] Preferably, the mirror of the embodiments above is a
        polycarbonate parabolic mirror that is between 0.5 and 1.0
        millimeters in thickness. Also preferably, the mirror is an
        altitude-azimuth off-axis segmented mirror that is between 2,000
        and 4,000 square feet in size. </p>
      <p>[0017] An aspect of the invention is that celestial light
        travels unobstructed into the focus cage, which may be disposed
        upon a rotating base member to better align with the
        mirror/collector. Moreover, the mirror itself in an embodiment
        of the invention is made rotatable by being disposed upon a
        rotating base member. Preferably, the rotating base member is a
        vertical axis azimuth stewing ring disposed atop a concrete pad.
      </p>
      <p>[0018] Given the wind shear and other potential constraints on
        utilizing large exposed mirrors (i.e., mirrors not housed within
        a structure such as a building or silo), the mirror preferably
        is disposed within a topographic depression, the depth of which
        is equal to at least one-third of the height of the mirror. </p>
      <p>[0019] Another embodiment of the invention features a celestial
        light collector that includes a parabolic mirror supported by a
        structure including struts and at least a pair of slewing rings
        such that the structure is rotatable in a horizontal plane, a
        focus cage disposed along a focal axis of the mirror, and a
        means for dispersing celestial light reflected by the parabolic
        mirror, with the means for dispersing located along the focal
        axis and housed within the focus cage. </p>
      <p>[0020] In accordance with these and other objects there is
        provided new and improved devices and methods for collecting,
        concentrating, and selecting celestial light spanning light
        spectra of electromagnetic radiation (e.g., infrared, visible,
        and ultraviolet light). </p>
      <p>[0021] Various other purposes and advantages of the invention
        will become clear from its description in the specification that
        follows. Therefore, to the accomplishment of the objectives
        described above, this invention includes the features
        hereinafter fully described in the detailed description of the
        preferred embodiments, and particularly pointed out in the
        claims. However, such description discloses only some of the
        various ways in which the invention may be practiced. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0027] The invention relates in general to devices and methods
        for collecting, concentrating, and separating celestial light of
        different wavelengths and frequencies by utilizing a relatively
        large collection mirror and a means for dispersion located at a
        focal point. As such, the invention does not provide images of
        celestial objects. </p>
      <p>[0028] The section headings used herein are for organizational
        purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the
        subject matter described. All references cited in this
        application are expressly incorporated by reference for any
        purpose. </p>
      <p>[0029] The term "celestial light" refers to light or
        electromagnetic spectra originating from somewhere other than
        the earth and covering the entire range from ultraviolet to
        infrared. </p>
      <p><b>I. Celestial Light Collectors</b> </p>
      <p>[0030] FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of a first embodiment
        of the invention. Shown is a celestial light collector 2 that
        includes a mirror 3, preferably of parabolic configuration and
        manufactured of polycarbonate between 0.5 and 1.0 millimeter in
        thickness, supported by a substrate 5 and made rotatable by
        pivot 6. The pivot 6 is disposed horizontally on a stand 8,
        which is joined to a rotatable base 10 in a pad 11 of,
        preferably, cement. The pivot 6 and base 10 allow the mirror 3
        to be adjusted in both the vertical and horizontal planes. </p>
      <p>[0031] A focus cage 12 is disposed along a focal axis A of
        mirror 3 and positioned a distance from the mirror corresponding
        to a focal point f.sub.p. Located along the focal axis A and
        housed within the focus cage 12 is a means 14 for dispersing
        celestial light reflected by the mirror 3. Preferably, the means
        4 for dispersing light is located at the focal point f.sub.p,
        thereby concentrating the spectrum before dispersion takes
        place. Exemplary means for dispersing light include, but are not
        limited to apertures, such as filters, lenses, diffraction
        gratings, and prisms. </p>
      <p>[0032] Although not shown in this figure, the collector 2 may
        further include a fresnel lens and/or a parabolic mirror adapted
        to refract celestial light within the focus cage. </p>
      <p>[0033] In order to collect and concentrate a large amount of
        light, the collector 2 must be relatively large. Preferably, the
        mirror 3 is actually a segmented array made up of many smaller
        mirror areas that total between 2,000 and 4,000 square feet.
        Given this large size, the focus cage 12 and mirror 3 preferably
        are not co-located within a common building. Indeed, for the
        collector illustrated by FIG. 1, there is 100 feet of open
        distance between the mirror and the focus cage. Accordingly, the
        distance between the focus cage and mirror such that the cage
        can be located at a focal point will necessarily depend on the
        mirror size. </p>
      <p>[0034] In this regard, the focus cage 12 preferably is mobile.
        Mobility may take the form of rotation, such as that achieved by
        having the focus cage 12 disposed upon rotating base member 16,
        or, for example, by attaching the cage to a track system (not
        illustrated) such that it may move toward or away from the
        mirror 3 or concentrically around the mirror as the mirror
        rotates. </p>
      <p>[0035] Unlike spectroscopes, the collector of the invention
        does not rely on slits or diffraction gratings to separate light
        into component wavelengths, and the celestial light collected by
        the mirror does not pass through analytical instrumentation,
        such as a photomultiplier or photodetector. Moreover, in
        contrast to spectroscopes, the invention concentrates
        interstellar light before dispersion into component wavelengths
        takes place. </p>
      <p>[0036] To reduce stress such as wind shear upon the invention,
        the collector 2 preferably is disposed within a topographic
        depression, the depth of which is equal to at least one-third of
        the height of said mirror. However, in the embodiment
        illustrated in FIG. 1, the collector 2 is disposed in a
        depression that is approximately sixty feet deep from ground
        level, which well exceeds one-third of the mirror height (also
        about sixty feet). </p>
      <p>[0037] Turning to FIG. 2, a light collector array 20 of the
        invention is shown. The collector array 20 includes a parabolic
        mirror 22 housed within a structure of struts 24, with a pair of
        slewing rings 26 disposed at each end of the parabolic mirror
        22. The slewing rings 26 provide for attitude control, and,
        moreover, allow light reflected from the mirror to travel
        unobstructed to the focus cage 30 along an optical axis B. The
        focus cage 30 is a building that will preferably contain
        research subjects, organic and inorganic matter, etc., onto
        which light may be applied. </p>
      <p>[0038] Preferably, the structure of struts 24 is mounted upon a
        rotatable base 32, such as a vertical axis azimuth stewing ring
        34 bolted atop a concrete pad 36. Also preferably, the focus
        cage 30 is disposed along focal axis B of the mirror 22 such
        that a means 38 for dispersing celestial light reflected by
        parabolic mirror 22 is located at a focal point (f.sub.p2) that
        is housed within the focus cage. </p>
      <p>[0039] As a result of locating the dispersion means 38 at focal
        point f.sub.p2, concentrated light is separated into component
        wavelengths (e.g., .lamda..sub.1, .lamda..sub.2, .lamda..sub.3).
        One or more of the component wavelengths are then used to expose
        matter (in this case biological matter 40), thereby ascertaining
        the effects of a spectrum of light not found on the earth. The
        concentrated light may further be manipulated by, for example,
        fresnel lens 41 or prism 42 before matter exposure. </p>
      <p>[0040] Preferably, the collector 20 has only a single mirror to
        reflect light to the focus cage 30, allowing light to travel
        unobstructed thereto. Also preferably, the means for dispersing
        light includes a lens between 0.5 and 8 millimeters in
        thickness. </p>
      <p>[0041] Turning to FIG. 3, a third embodiment of a mirror of the
        invention is shown. </p>
      <p>[0042] Mirror 44 is composed of an array of segments 46 and is
        preferably parabolic in shape. The segments 46 are surrounded by
        a drive ring 48 that is in rotational contact with altitude yoke
        50 via rollers 52. The altitude yoke 50 preferably surrounds the
        drive ring 48, although only a cut-away portion is shown in this
        particular illustration. </p>
      <p>[0043] The segmented design allows the construction of
        relatively large mirrors, i.e., 20-80 feet in diameter. Given
        this relatively large mirror size, the concentration of
        interstellar light is believed to be well beyond known
        collectors, in that the concentrated light is at least five
        orders of magnitude brighter than a single object viewed. </p>
      <p>[0044] FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of an individual mirror
        segment. A thin (e.g., 0.5 millimeter) plastic mirror 56 (e.g.,
        polycarbonate) is laminated onto a foam substrate 58. The foam
        substrate may include, for example, a five centimeter slab of
        urethane. The foam substrate layer 58 is further laminated onto
        a rigid panel 60, such as aluminum sandwiched between fiberglass
        for good thermal conductivity. </p>
      <p><b>II. Methods for Concentrating and Selecting Celestial Light
          by Wavelength and/or Frequency</b> </p>
      <p>[0045] As summarized in FIG. 5, the inventive method for
        collecting celestial light includes the steps of collecting
        light from a celestial source by utilizing a mirror, focusing
        the light collected by the mirror to a focal point, dispersing
        the focused light utilizing an aperture located at the focal
        point, and exposing terrestrial matter to at least a portion of
        the dispersed light. </p>
      <p>[0046] In some applications, the method of the invention may
        further involve collimating the collected and/or dispersed
        light, utilizing a fresnel lens, or utilizing a polycarbonate
        parabolic mirror prior to dispersion. Preferably, the mirror
        comprises a polycarbonate mirror structure that is between 0.5
        and 1.0 millimeters in thickness and is disposed upon a mobile
        supporting structure. Moreover, the focal point aperture
        preferably is a lens between 0.5 and 8.0 millimeters in
        thickness. </p>
      <p>[0047] In other applications, the concentrated interstellar
        light is collimated and further pinpointed to less than a
        millimeter by using fresnel lenses or parabolic mirrors. In
        still other applications, the collimated light is pulsed or
        strobed. Due to the barriers, such as the atmosphere, and the
        relatively weak intensity of un-concentrated interstellar light,
        the method presents a unique opportunity to expose biological
        matter to previously unknown spectra. </p>
      <p><b>III. Applications of Collected and Concentrated Celestial
          Light</b> </p>
      <p>[0048] In certain embodiments, methods for applying
        concentrated and selected celestial light are contemplated. </p>
      <p>[0049] 1) Medical: [0050] A) Photo Dynamic Therapy--Using light
        to treat cancer, detect tumors, and to treat skin diseases such
        as psoriasis. Other uses would be to treat ailments such as
        Seasonal Affective Disorder or clinical depression. [0051] B)
        Surgery--Using light to develop new technologies for minimally
        invasive therapies, methods that reduce trauma involved with
        traditional surgical techniques. [0052] C) Optical Diagnostic
        Techniques--In this field, light has such applications as blood
        monitoring, retinal photography, and glucose monitoring in
        diabetes. </p>
      <p>[0053] 2) Entertainment: [0054] A) LASER Light
        Shows--Entertaining light shows, often choreographed with music,
        such as those seen at hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., or
        at amusement parks. [0055] B) Holograms--Including advancements
        in reversible holography and switched holographic gratings. </p>
      <p>[0056] 3) Agriculture [0057] A) Germination: Using light to
        stimulate or inhibit the growth processes, such as photoblastic
        stimulus of seeds. One potential use would be longer seed
        dormancy. [0058] B) Phytochromatic Stimulus: Using light to
        control responses of the photoreceptor phytochrome in plants, in
        order to stimulate desired growth patterns. [0059] C) Vegetative
        Stimulus: Using light to stimulate the major growth receptors in
        plants, such as cytokinine, in order to achieve desired effects.
      </p>
      <p>[0060] 4) Industry: [0061] A) Photopolymerization: Currently,
        there are a myriad uses for photopolymerization. Four such
        applications would involve using light to create the following:
        plastics that are more durable, adhesives, sealants, and metal
        coatings. [0062] B) Photolithography: Using light essentially as
        an enabler in integrated circuit processing. [0063] C) Optical
        storage: Using light to enable existing technologies, such as
        compact disks, to store more information. [0064] D) Printing
        Materials: Including pre-press proofing systems, printing inks,
        printing plates, and the production of Braille materials. </p>
      <p>[0065] 5) Scientific Research: [0066] A) Photochemistry:
        Including experimentation through photosensitization and
        photocatalysis. [0067] B) Photoelectric Effect </p>
      <p>[0068] The invention, having been described above, may be
        better understood by reference to examples. The following
        examples are intended for illustration purposes only, and should
        not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any
        way. </p>
      <p><b>PROPHETIC EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0069] Celestial light is concentrated and selected for
        application to the skin of a test subject suffering from
        depression. This can be achieved with as little as 30 min. of
        very bright light near 10,000 lux or with a couple hours of
        light of about 2500 lux so as to simulate an average daily
        exposure for light, i.e., 250 or more lux for a sunny location.
      </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0070] A theory has been developed that celestial pure light,
        being comprised of alpha particles, ions, protons and neutrons,
        is different than artificially produced light; and, that this
        light comes in various wavelengths and frequencies and therefore
        various colors. The invention could be used to test this theory
        by collecting, concentrating, and dispersing celestial light so
        that its color, wavelength, and frequency can be studied and
        compared with artificially produced light. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0071] A theory has been developed that the effects of the
        celestial pure light on the growth of various polymers and
        crystals will result in important shapes, sizes and structures
        in the industrial and scientific communities. This theory would
        be tested by exposing polymers and crystals to different
        wavelengths and intensities of celestial light collected,
        concentrated, and dispersed according to the method of the
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>Example 4</b> </p>
      <p>[0072] A theory has been developed that celestial light will
        have profound effect on the chromophores in plants, and also the
        phytochromes, yielding various growth factors. To test this
        hypothesis, plant matter will be exposed to different
        wavelengths and intensities of celestial light collected,
        concentrated, and dispersed according to the method of the
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>Example 5</b> </p>
      <p>[0073] A theory has been developed that utilizing the various
        wavelengths and frequencies of the celestial bodies will show
        results that are different than what is being researched in
        reference to porphyrins. In particular, we propose to expose
        porphyrins to different wavelengths and frequencies of celestial
        light collected, concentrated, and dispersed according to the
        method of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0074] Various changes in the details and components that have
        been described may be made by those skilled in the art within
        the principles and scope of the invention herein described in
        the specification and defined in the appended claims. For
        example, the mirror of FIG. 3 may instead be trapezoidal in
        configuration. Therefore, while the present invention has been
        shown and described herein in what is believed to be the most
        practical and preferred embodiments, it is recognized that
        departures can be made therefrom within the scope of the
        invention, which is not to be limited to the details disclosed
        herein but is to be accorded the full scope of the claims so as
        to embrace any and all equivalent processes and products. </p>
