      <br>
      In mid-February, about a month after a massive earthquake leveled
      much of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, a wound-care team from Brigham and
      Women’s hospital in Boston traveled to the devastated capital. The
      team’s task was to help care for scores of patients suffering from
      the large open wounds that accompany amputations, crushed limbs,
      and other injuries. Among the team was MIT graduate student
      Danielle Zurovcik, who arrived ready to test a device she had
      developed as part of her thesis research–a cheap and portable
      version of the negative-pressure devices currently used to speed
      wound healing in hospitals.<br>
      <br>
      Zurovcik and her collaborators hope the device, which costs about
      $3, will provide a way to improve care for patients after the
      emergency phase of relief efforts, including life- and limb-saving
      surgeries, has ended. Even after many of the emergency medical
      teams leave the disaster zone, the dangers of chronic wounds
      remain high.<br>
      <br>
      “My experience in Haiti and other major earthquakes is that after
      the acute medical response, such as amputating limbs and setting
      fractures, the major disease burden is wounds,” says Robert
      Riviello, a trauma surgeon at Brigham and Women’s, and Zurovcik’s
      collaborator. Negative-pressure therapy decreases the need to
      change wound dressings from one to three times per day to once
      every few days, a major benefit when medical staff is in short
      supply.<br>
      <br>
      Negative-pressure devices, which act like a vacuum over the
      bandaged wound, have become a central part of wound therapy in the
      United States over the last decade. They speed healing up to
      threefold, depending on the type of wound, and in some cases
      eliminate the need for plastic surgery or skin grafts. A number of
      commercial versions are available in the U.S. and are used to
      treat burns and chronic wounds such as bed sores or diabetic foot
      ulcers. While scientists don’t exactly know why this treatment
      accelerates the healing process, it likely helps by removing some
      of the fluid and bacteria that accumulates at the injury site and
      by increasing blood flow to the wound. The pressure itself may
      also help healing by bringing together the edges of the wound and
      delivering mechanical pressure, which has been shown to spur cell
      growth, says Dennis Orgill, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s who
      was not involved in the project.<br>
      <br>
      Existing devices are often heavy, about five to 10 pounds, and
      require an energy source to create the vacuum, making them
      difficult to apply in disaster settings. Texas-based KCI, the
      leading maker of negative-pressure machines, has a portable
      version that’s battery powered, but it costs approximately $100
      per day to rent. A number of companies are working on even more
      portable versions, say Orgill.<br>
      <br>
      But Zurovcik, inspired by a burn surgeon’s plea, went a step
      further, designing a human-powered device that applies pressure
      via a simple bellows pump weighing less than half a pound. By
      improving the seal around the wound dressing to reduce air leaks,
      Zurovcik cut the pump’s power requirements from about 14 watts to
      80 microwatts, which comes from a hand pump.<br>
      <br>
      “To basically take a toilet plunger and produce negative pressure
      over a prolonged period of time, that is really great,” says
      Kristian Olson, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, in
      Boston, who was not involved in the project. “Not only do I see it
      answering this need in developing countries, I think it could
      really enhance home therapy for chronic wounds in the U.S.”<br>
      <br>
      Zurovcik and Riviello had been planning a trial of the device in
      Rwanda – Riviello spends about half his time working in
      Africa–when the earthquake hit Haiti. Colleagues treating the
      first waves of injury victims told the duo that their device might
      be of help, so they joined a wound-care team headed for University
      Hospital, a few blocks from the leveled palace in Port-au-Prince.
      (Commercial negative-pressure devices, known as VACS, were
      employed in various relief efforts in Haiti, including $2 million
      worth of equipment donated by KCI.)<br>
      <br>
      Working in stifling tents filled with patients, the team tended to
      those whose doctors had left and were in need of follow-up care.
      Of the hundreds of patients assessed, the researchers chose eight
      people suffering from a variety of injuries– amputations, open
      tissue wounds, open fractures, crushing injuries (where the skin
      had to be opened to give the muscle room to expand), infected
      surgical wounds, and bedsores from being paralyzed–appropriate for
      negative-pressure therapy. “Because this was a disaster setting,
      we didn’t feel it was an appropriate place for rolling out a
      randomized controlled trial,” says Riviello. (They cared for other
      patients with typical dressings.)<br>
      <br>
      The surgeon would first apply a sponge over the cleaned wound and
      then cover it with a plastic seal. A tube fed through a small hole
      in the plastic connected to the pump, which was manually
      compressed to create negative pressure. The team trained patients’
      families, who often took on typical nursing duties, to charge, or
      pump, the device. “We learned that family members are interested
      in being trained and motivated to keep the device charged because
      they saw the benefits for their loved ones,” says Riviello. “They
      were tremendously reliable. We saw patients twice a day, but it
      became clear that we could come back days later and the device
      would still be charged.”<br>
      <br>
      Because the researchers were in Haiti for just 10 days, they
      weren’t able to determine if the device helped patients heal
      faster. But it did seem to keep the wounds cleaner, says Riviello,
      and reduced the need to change bandages, which is painful for the
      patient. In fact, one patient requested the treatment after
      observing how a neighbor in the next bed was subjected to fewer
      painful dressing changes, says Zurovcik. Now back in Cambridge,
      she is tinkering with the prototype, trying to further improve the
      pressure seal and the amount of negative pressure the device can
      deliver.<br>
      <br>
      The team plans a larger test in Rwanda, where it will likely put
      the device to broader use. People in poor countries are much less
      likely to survive severe burns, for example, which can be helped
      with negative-pressure therapy. And the rate of complications from
      diabetes, such as foot ulcers, is skyrocketing in these countries
      as well, says Olson.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [002] This invention relates to dressings intended to provide a
      fluid-impervious barrier over skin, and more particularly to
      dressings suitable for negative pressure wound therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [003] Negative pressure wound therapy ("NPWT") is an effective
      technology for treating open wounds. NPWT devices were originally
      accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in 1995,
      when the FDA approved a 510(K) for the Kinetic Concepts Inc.
      ("KCI")'s V.A.C.(R) device. The definition of NPWT devices by the
      FDA has changed over the years; in general terms, its definition
      is: a system that is used to apply negative pressure for wound
      management purposes, including the removal of fluids (i.e., wound
      exudates, irrigation fluids, and infectious materials). The
      negative pressure is applied through a porous dressing positioned
      into or over the wound cavity, depending on wound type and depth,
      or over a flap or graft; the dressing distributes the pressure
      while removing fluids from the wound. NWPT systems typically
      include:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Non-adhesive wound dressing used to fill the wound
      cavity (e.g., a sterilized medical sponge or gauze; a.k.a.,
      non-adhesive packing materials);<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Drainage tube placed adjacent to or into the dressing;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Occlusive transparent film placed over the dressing (and
      potentially the drainage tube) and adhered to the skin to maintain
      a seal;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Collection container for drained fluids from the wound;
      and<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Low pressure vacuum source.<br>
      <br>
      [004] NPWT has been approved by the FDA to treat many wound types:
      chronic, acute, traumatic, sub-acute and dehisced wounds,
      partial-thickness burns, ulcers (such as diabetic, venous or
      pressure), surgically closed incisions (a.k.a., closed surgical
      incisions), flaps and grafts. The prescribed therapy time depends
      on wound type, wound dimensions, and patient conditions; it
      typically lasts from four weeks to four months. Disposable
      dressing components are changed approximately every three days.<br>
      <br>
      [005] Extensive clinical trials have demonstrated the success of
      negative pressure in healing the approved wound types by applying
      a controlled negative pressure typically between 20mmHg and
      200mmHg. Most studies applied a constant vacuum pressure, with
      125mmHg being the most common, although cyclic and intermittent
      studies are currently underway. Evidence supporting the use of
      NPWT in the treatment of chronic, non-healing wounds exists
      primarily in the form of nonrandomized, controlled trials;
      prospective and retrospective large and small case series;
      single-center studies; and single case studies, with few
      randomized, controlled clinical trials. Studies also exist that
      demonstrate NPWT benefits in healing acute wounds. Additionally,
      since 2006, benefits of managing surgical incisions
      post-operatively have been shown with improved clinical outcomes;
      at least ten studies have been published to date. From these
      studies, proven medical benefits of NPWT treatment include:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Promotes blood flow (perfusion) at the wound;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Removes interstitial fluid (a.k.a., wound exudates),
      reduces edema;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Decreases counts of bacteria and infectious materials;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Increases rate of granulation tissue formation, reducing
      scar tissue formation, increases growth factors and fibroblasts;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Uniformly draws the wound edges together;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Provides a protected healing environment; and<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; Provides a moist environment.<br>
      <br>
      [006] Although significant clinical evidence exists to support the
      benefit of NPWT as a safe therapy in healing chronic wounds, it is
      possible during NPWT to rupture a vein or artery. Usually, a
      machine safety alarm will signify a fluid leak rate that exceeds
      the rate that the machine was designed for. This alarmed leak rate
      typically includes the combination of both air and liquid, and
      typically has an upper safety limit of the minimum blood flow rate
      possible out of a wound cavity with an actively bleeding vein or
      artery. If a vein or artery accidently ruptures, the system must
      shut down. Therefore, it is very important to have a safety
      feature that stops blood flow if this occurs, in order not to
      exsanguinate the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [007] Lina et al. describe in U.S. Patent No. 7,611,500 and
      WO1996/005873 an initial apparatus used for NPWT. In practice, the
      device proved to be effective; however, one major limitation was
      detected: the high electrical grid power source needed to operate
      the device limited the mobility of a patient. Therefore, future
      refinements, such as that described by Hunt et al. in U.S. Patent
      No. 6,142,982, incorporated rechargeable batteries for the power
      source. Batteries increased patient mobility, but time was limited
      by the life of the batteries between charges. Additionally,
      battery management became an issue, especially for facilities with
      a high number of NPWT patients, and electrical grid power was
      still needed to recharge the batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [008] Eliminating the need for electrical power, via the grid or
      batteries, would create a more widely applicable, clinically
      viable therapy. The power requirement variability of a system is
      dependent on the desired vacuum pressure, rate of wound exudate
      removal from the wound cavity, and the leak rate of air into the
      system. As the air leak rate increases, more power is needed to
      supply a continuous negative pressure at a predetermined value or
      threshold range at the wound bed. Air leakage into the NPWT system
      requires the most power of any other component. Air leaks are the
      obstacle to creating a vacuum system that does not require a
      continuous external power source or frequent recharging of its
      internal power storage. Therefore, the feasibility of a mechanical
      NPWT system is heavily reliant on the seal quality of every
      interface in the system. The dressing system has been identified
      as the main source of air leaks in current NPWT systems,
      particularly at the interfaces between 1) the dressing and the
      skin and 2) the tube and the dressing. The amount of air leaks
      into these interfaces determines the time frequency that the pump
      needs to be recharged and the magnitude of vacuum pressure applied
      to the wound cavity at a specific time. These two latter
      characteristics are dependent system parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [009] Few mechanical NPWT systems are currently available, as
      described by the present inventor in "Development of a simplified
      Negative Pressure Wound Device" submitted in 2007 for her Master
      of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology. Certain lower-pressure, mechanical
      devices were disclosed later by Hu et al. in U.S. Patent
      Application No. 2010/0228205. Current mechanical systems typically
      use sophisticated-material, planar dressings, such as hydrocolloid
      dressings, to try to solve the air leak problem. However, the
      inherent geometry mismatch of a planar dressing and the contoured
      skin surface often leads to air leaks. The mechanical devices
      therefore are only applicable for select, relatively flat surfaces
      on the body and, even then, it is difficult to eliminate air leaks
      entirely. [010] Non-electrical pumps are at the low end of the
      spectrum of medical pumps, typically utilizing bladder pumps and
      capillary action materials. Bladder pumps are used for both
      extracting and inserting fluids. By their physical
      characteristics, they are governed by non-linear spring like
      properties. Currently, bladder pumps are used in wound treatments
      for drainage purposes, particularly for internal, body cavity
      drainage. C. R. Bard, Inc. manufacturers many of these
      non-electrical pumps; one bladder model frequently used to drain
      internal cavities is commonly referred to as a Jackson Pratt
      Drain.<br>
      <br>
      [011] There are various limitations to applying NPWT with existing
      mechanical, bladder pumps. There are no pressure gauges on the
      pumps and, therefore, the user does not know the initial magnitude
      of the negative pressure pulled, and cannot monitor the pressure
      during therapy. Additionally, there are no air leak detection
      systems for the current pumps, except to visually watch for the
      expansion of the bladder at a rate higher than expected. If the
      pump is clear, one can also visually monitor if the expansion rate
      is due to air leaks or due to drainage fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [012] Capillary action materials are also currently used to treat
      wounds by providing very low negative pressure treatment, too low
      to be considered NPWT. This form of treatment is usually found in
      dressings such as small topical bandages to provide NPWT- like
      benefits to very small, self-healing wounds, such as blisters and
      brush burns. Treating a wound with this technology enhances the
      healing environment. Capillary action materials are filled with
      small capillaries between the wound and outside environment. A
      negative pressure is applied by capillary action of fluid flowing
      from the wound to the outside environment, thereby, removing
      interstitial fluid. One example of a capillary action material is
      Johnson &amp; Johnson's First Aid Advanced Care Advanced Healing
      Adhesive Pads.<br>
      <br>
      [013] Dressing technologies have tried to address the issue of air
      leaks into NPWT systems. This is important to both electrical and
      mechanical systems to reduce their necessary power requirements.
      In mechanical systems, it is necessary for clinically relevant
      device functionality, such that power input and pump recharge time
      is reasonable for a caregiver and/or patient to perform. For
      electrical systems, air leak reduction reduces the number of, if
      not completely eliminates, false-positive, alarmed emergency
      system shutdowns. Air leak reduction allows battery designs to
      last longer on one battery charge and use lower power capacity
      batteries altogether. Air leak elimination potentially eliminates
      the need for a continuous power supply, as the vacuum pressure can
      be maintained in the occlusive environment within a specified
      threshold, for which the timeframe depends on the pump parameters
      and exudate removal rate (typically less than 100 mL/day) from the
      wound.<br>
      <br>
      [014] Currently, most NPWT dressings (the drape component) are
      thin, planar, tape-like adhesive dressings that must be applied to
      a contoured area of skin. A backing on the dressing must be
      removed to expose the adhesive, and then the dressing is applied
      to the skin. The pre-application handling of the dressings alone
      introduces a probability for air leaks, as the dressing typically
      folds onto itself or creases very easily due to its low bending
      stiffness; many dressings are thinner than a piece of standard
      paper, and the bending stiffness of a material is proportional to
      the inverse of its thickness cubed. As a dressing is applied, it
      must often fold onto itself in order to accommodate for a
      geometrical mismatch between the planar dressing and the contours
      of the body surrounding the wound to be treated. This creates
      creases, also referred to herein as wrinkles, in the dressing that
      have a high potential for causing air leaks into the NPWT system.<br>
      <br>
      [015] Adding to the geometrical mismatch, the dressings often
      become less adhesive due to the introduction of foreign materials
      onto the adhesive before dressing application. This is most common
      and almost unavoidable at the edges of the dressing due to
      handling by the caregiver. At times, the caregiver's hands
      introduce enough foreign particles onto the adhesive to forbid
      further adhesion of that area of the dressing. In the U.S., this
      often happens when a caregiver uses powdered gloves. This is a
      critical issue as the edges of the dressing are an area where leak
      propagation from the edge of the dressing to the wound cavity is
      potentially very high, based on the theory of interface fracture
      mechanics.<br>
      <br>
      [016] For the electrical NPWT systems, a thin plastic, adhesive
      backed dressing is typically used. Electrical NPWT dressing
      systems have not readily addressed the air leak issues listed
      above that form at the dressing-to-skin interface. Instead,
      dressing iterations have focused on air leaks at the
      tube-to-dressing interface. When NPWT was first introduced into
      the market, the drainage tube was inserted into the wound cavity
      through the edge of the dressing. This introduced a high potential
      for air leaks, which often alarmed the shut-off system. Caregivers
      began to solve this problem by raising the tube from the skin
      surface at the dressing edge, and pinching the dressing under the
      tube before the dressing contacts the skin. This caused the
      dressing to adhere to itself in an upside-down "T" pattern onto
      the skin. [017] Eventually, some of the NPWT dressing, commercial
      designs incorporated their own solutions to the high air leak rate
      at the tubing interface. Out of these solutions, the T.R.A.C. Pad
      by KCI was highly effective, which is driving the current design
      trends. The T.R.A.C. Pad prefabricates the drainage tube to a
      semi-rigid, tubing connector, which is then attached to a small,
      circular, planar adhesive dressing (a.k.a., drape). All of these
      connections are made air-tight during its manufacture. The tubing
      does not travel beyond the plane of the adhesive dressing, and
      therefore its opening remains at the skin surface. When the
      T.R.A.C. Pad is used, the standard dressing is initially applied
      to the wound, without a tubing connection. Then, a small incision
      is made in the dressing, over the wound cavity; this hole may also
      be prefabricated into the drape component of the dressing during
      its manufacture. The film backing of the circular adhesive
      component is removed from the Pad, and the tube opening is
      centered over the incision. Since the adhesive surface of the Pad
      is small, it is easier to handle than the procedure of tunneling
      the tube into the initial dressing. Although the Pad does not
      guarantee elimination of air leaks at the tube-to-dressing
      interface, it highly reduces the probable amount of air leaks into
      the dressing, based on its ergonomic design and small profile. A
      minimal amount of air leaks is almost unavoidable for all
      applications with planar adhesive components, due to the
      geometrical mismatch and user handling that still remain.<br>
      <br>
      [018] Many efforts have been made in order to overcome the
      identified barriers of low end, mechanical pumps for application
      in NPWT. Most of the focus has been on reducing air leaks and
      creating more predictable vacuum sources. New materials used in
      NPWT dressings have been the main driver in reducing the air leak
      rate into the system at the dressing-skin interface. These
      materials are often not new to wound dressings; however, they are
      new to NPWT. Pump design has been the focus of creating more
      predictable vacuum sources; mechanical components, such as linear
      or constant force springs, are often introduced into the system
      and maintain a more predictable behavior throughout therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [019] Only one mechanical NPWT system is on the market today, but
      is not widely used: SNaP(R) Wound Care System by Spiracur
      (Sunnyvale, CA). The SNaP(R) Wound Care System uses a hydrocolloid
      dressing with specific mechanical connectors from the tube to the
      dressing, in order to accommodate for air leaks; the provided
      hydrocolloid dressing is relatively small in size. HydrocoUoids
      are used in many wound-dressing systems, and are a common trend in
      the NPWT market. They are stiffer and thicker than most common,
      adhesive, planar, NPWT specific dressings. This causes the
      dressing to fold onto itself less during its handling and
      application. However, it cannot accommodate for geometrical
      mismatch without creases, especially as the dressing surface area
      increases. Since the dressing is stiffer and thicker, these
      creases are difficult to seal in an air-tight manner, due to its
      increased bending stiffness. Therefore, hydrocolloids are often
      only applicable to smaller wounds. Much effort is currently being
      taken to make them thinner, in order to increase their applicable
      surface area and accommodate more for contours, such as the
      Replicare Thin Hydrocolloid Dressing by Smith and Nephew.
      Hydrocolloids rely on their extremely sticky adhesive properties
      to account for increased skin adhesion and reduced air leaks. If
      they come in contact with wound exudate, the polymers in the
      hydrocolloid swell with water until saturation, forming a gel,
      which is held solid in its adhesive matrix structure.<br>
      <br>
      [020] In the SNaP(R) Wound Care System, the hydrocolloid dressings
      are connected to the tubing with a mechanical connector component,
      similar to the T.R.A.C. Pad, KCI. The SNaP(R) Wound Care System
      eliminates any potential air leaks from this mechanical connector
      by prefabricating it to the center of the entire dressing during
      manufacture. The prefabrication eliminates any potential air leaks
      at the tube-to-dressing interface due to user interface and
      geometrical mismatch, but it is not capable of being moved on the
      dressing surface. Therefore, it may need to be placed on an
      inconvenient area of the wound, such as a location that is
      uncomfortable for the patient. Additionally, the tube runs
      parallel to the plane of the drape; the direction of the tube
      along the plane of the drape is fixed. Since the dressings are not
      typically round, the tube path may be required to travel in an
      undesirable path, in order to cover the wound area with the preset
      shape of the drape.<br>
      <br>
      [021] For its vacuum source, the SNaP(R) Wound Care System uses a
      complex system, driven by constant force springs. Therefore, as
      the pump expands, mainly due to air leaks and potentially exudate
      removal, the pressure remains relatively constant for the length
      of the pressure application. This system is expensive and highly
      technical when compared to the non-electrical pumps at the low end
      of the medical pump spectrum (e.g., bladder pumps); however, it is
      the first commercial mechanical NPWT pump, which has been proven
      to be a potential NPWT pump design. Since air leaks into the
      dressing system remain highly probable, depending on wound
      location and caregiver experience, the successful application of
      the SNaP(R) Wound Care System is limited in practice.<br>

      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; mechanical methods to minimize the possibility of
      exsanguinating the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [023] Occlusive dressings according to the present invention
      overcome the aforementioned drawbacks by being truly air-tight.
      One principal application of this technology is to facilitate
      administration of mechanical NPWT. A liquid component is applied
      at the dressing-to-skin interface in order to create a
      substantially air-tight seal preferably for at least 48 hours,
      more preferably for at least 72 hours. Preferably the same or
      different liquid component is applied at the tube-to-dressing
      interface in order to create a similar air-tight seal. In some
      embodiments, the liquid components may be made of rubber polymers
      applied by touch, by squeezing a dispenser, or by spraying the
      polymers with an atomization process.<br>
      <br>
      [024] This invention features a kit suitable for occlusively
      sealing a wound penetrating the skin of a patient, including a
      drape formed as a thin sheet of an organic, preferably elastomeric
      material, substantially impervious to fluid transfer of air and
      bodily fluids, having first and second surfaces. A biocompatible
      adhesive is at least one of (1) disposed on at least the first
      surface of the drape and (2) capable of contacting at least a
      portion of at least the first surface of the drape. When the kit
      includes the biocompatible adhesive disposed on at least a portion
      of the first surface of the drape, the kit further includes at
      least a first removable liner sheet covering the first surface of
      the drape. In some embodiments, a second removable liner sheet
      covers the second surface of the drape, especially when adhesive
      is also disposed on the second surface of the drape. The kit
      further includes at least one container of at least one sealant
      component that is capable of being delivered as a sealant in a
      liquid state at pre-selected ambient conditions, the sealant as
      delivered being at least partially cross-linked at least after one
      of drying and curing, and which is capable of at least one of
      drying and curing within thirty minutes, preferably within twenty
      minutes and, more preferably, within ten minutes, after
      application of the sealant as a layer to the edges of the drape
      after the drape is applied to the skin surrounding the wound.<br>
      <br>
      [025] In some embodiments, the drape and the sealant after one of
      drying and curing are elastomeric. In a number of embodiments, the
      drape and the sealant are derived from substantially the same
      material, such as a type of a latex compound or a type of silicone
      compound. In certain embodiments, the adhesive is a silicone-based
      adhesive and is disposed on at least a majority of each of the
      first and second surfaces of the drape as a solid coating or in a
      pattern such as a grid or concentric circles. At least one
      container of a sealant component enables manual application of the
      sealant in some embodiments, such as by squeezing the container
      and, in other embodiments, at least one container is a removable
      vial or cartridge insertable into a dispensing apparatus or other
      applicator. In a number of embodiments, the kit further includes a
      flexible tube having a first end and a second end connectable to a
      source of negative pressure such as a bellows, especially a novel
      bellows which unrolls, or other mechanical vacuum source.
      Preferably, the kit further includes a flange having at least one
      of (1) a central passage through which the first end of the tube
      is insertable and (2) a central passage communicating with a
      connector capable of mating with the first end of the tube. In one
      embodiment, the first end of the tube includes a feature such as a
      spiral cut to resist blockage of the tube. In some embodiments,
      the kit includes at least one non-stick handling component. In a
      number of embodiments, the kit further includes at least one wound
      packing material.<br>
      <br>
      [026] This invention may also be expressed as a method of
      constructing an occlusive dressing over a wound penetrating the
      skin of a patient by selecting a drape formed as a thin sheet of
      an elastomeric material, substantially impervious to fluid
      transfer, and having first and second surfaces. A biocompatible
      adhesive is selected that is at least one of (1) disposed on at
      least the first surface of the drape, preferably with a first
      removable liner sheet covering the first surface of the drape and
      (2) applied to at least one of (i) the skin of the patient
      surrounding the wound and (ii) at least a portion of at least the
      first surface of the drape. Optionally, a second removable liner
      sheet covers the second surface of the drape. The method includes
      removing the first removable liner, if present, and placing the
      drape onto the skin surrounding the wound, removing the second
      removable liner if present, and applying a sealant that is in a
      liquid state as applied, the sealant being at least partially
      cross-linked at least after one of drying and curing, on at least
      the edges of the drape and on the skin adjacent to the drape in
      one or more layers. The method further includes at least one of
      drying and curing the sealant within thirty minutes, preferably
      within twenty minutes, after application of the sealant to the
      edges of the drape in at least one layer.<br>
      <br>
      [027] In certain embodiments, the adhesive is disposed on at least
      a majority of each of the first and second surfaces of the drape,
      and/or the method includes pressing on the second surface of the
      drape in the vicinity of any wrinkles in the drape, preferably
      before sealant is applied in that vicinity. In some embodiments, a
      flexible tube is selected having a first end and a second end
      connectable to a source of negative pressure such as a bellows or
      other mechanical vacuum source. Preferably, the first end of the
      tube (1) is inserted through a central passage of a flange secured
      to the drape or (2) is mated with a connector on a flange having a
      central passage communicating with the connector. In one
      embodiment, the first end of the tube includes a feature such as a
      spiral cut to resist blockage of the tube. In some embodiments,
      the wound is packed with gauze or other fluid-pervious material
      prior to placing the drape on the skin.<br>
      <br>
      [028] This invention may be further expressed as a method of
      constructing an occlusive dressing over a wound, penetrating the
      skin of a patient, by at least one of (1) packing the wound with a
      fluid-pervious material and (2) covering at least a portion of the
      wound with a protective material. The method further includes
      applying, such as by spraying, an elastomeric material that is in
      a liquid state, and is at least partially cross-linked at least
      after one of drying and curing, over the packed material and onto
      skin surrounding the wound to create an occlusive drape as a thin
      sheet substantially impervious to fluid transfer, having a first,
      inner surface and a second, outer surface. The method includes at
      least one of drying and curing the elastomeric material within
      thirty minutes after application of the elastomeric material as a
      layer. <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[068] This invention may be accomplished by a kit, dressing
      system or method utilizing a drape formed as a thin sheet of an
      organic, preferably elastomeric material, substantially impervious
      to fluid transfer of air and bodily fluids for preferably at least
      48 hours, more preferably at least 72 hours, having first and
      second surfaces. Preferably, a biocompatible adhesive is disposed
      on, applied to or contacted with, at least the first surface of
      the drape. In a number of constructions, a first removable liner
      sheet covers the first surface of the drape and, optionally, a
      second removable liner sheet covers the second surface of the
      drape. The invention further utilizes a container of at least one
      sealant component that is capable of being delivered as a sealant
      in a liquid state at pre-selected ambient conditions, the sealant
      as delivered being at least partially cross-linked at least after
      one of drying and curing, and which is capable of at least one of
      drying and curing within thirty minutes, preferably within twenty
      minutes and, more preferably, within ten minutes after application
      of the sealant as a layer to the edges of the drape after the
      drape is applied to the skin surrounding the wound.<br>
      <br>
      [069] The occlusive dressings presently disclosed address the
      power/mobility and air leak issues by eliminating the need for an
      electrical power source and by maintaining reliably air-tight
      interfaces, particularly at 1) the dressing and the skin and 2)
      the tube and the dressing. The disclosed dressing systems and
      their connection methods allow for reliable, mechanical NPWT
      systems. Not only does this eliminate patient mobility and battery
      management issues, but it also allows NPWT to be administered in
      austere environments, where electricity is often scarce and harsh
      environments require robust products. Multiple disclosed
      embodiments support an inexpensive, robust therapy method for
      global application. Additionally, dressings according to the
      present invention are MRI- compatible.<br>
      <br>
      [070] In order to obtain an air-tight skin dressing, the present
      occlusive dressings use a liquid sealant. This liquid sealant may
      dry and cure fast, even immediately or effectively immediately,
      upon application to the skin or other dressing components, into a
      continuous, occlusive film or sheet of material. The drying and
      curing processes may occur simultaneously, may be driven by
      evaporation, may require a curing agent and/or accelerator, and/or
      may be enhanced or controlled with a curing agent and/or
      accelerator. Any extra additives (e.g., curing agents and
      accelerators) may be added just before, during, and/or after the
      sealant application process, depending on its chemical reaction
      with the sealant and its rate.<br>
      <br>
      [071] The liquid sealant bonds to the component(s) that it is
      meant to seal. The ability of Van der Waals forces to provide the
      bond strength without an added adhesive is based on the material
      and its thickness. Theoretically, the debond toughness (strength
      of the bond) must be greater than the debonding energy, and the
      debonding energy is proportional to: the thickness of the
      material, the strain in the material squared, and the elastic
      modulus of the material. Specifically (on a first order basis; as
      its basis is a small strain analysis), the bond strength of a thin
      film must abide by Equation 1, where [Gamma] is the debond
      toughness, [sigma] is the debonding energy, [Omega] is a
      dimensionless prefactor, h is the thickness of the film,
      [epsilon][tau] is the strain in tension, and Ef is the elastic
      modulus of the film, in order to maintain adhesion to the skin in
      tension:<br>
      <br>
      [Gamma] &gt; [sigma] = [Omega]1[iota][epsilon][tau][3/4](1)<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a highly elastic, thin film presents the ideal material
      properties for reduced, required adhesion strength, increasing the
      functional applicability of the Van der Waals forces.<br>
      <br>
      [072] An additional adhesive, such as a silicone-based,
      latex-based, or acrylic- based glue, having one or more
      components, might be employed to produce the desired bond strength
      (for example, Liqui-Tape Silicone Adhesive, Waterproof by Walker
      Tape Co., West Jordan, UT). This adhesive can be applied under the
      liquid sealant or chemically mixed with the liquid sealant prior
      to its application, depending on its chemical make-up and final
      mixing properties. When applied under the sealant, the adhesive
      may need to become tacky (a.k.a., applied set time) prior to
      sealant overlay. A fast-setting, two-part sealant that is mixed
      prior to use may be useful in some circumstances, such as Skin
      Tite(R) silicone available from Smooth On, Easton, Pennsylvania,
      which is ACMI Certified Safe and may be used by itself or mixed
      with a thickener, such as Thi-vex(R) thickener, also available
      from Smooth On. A polymer sealant, or other material with the
      ability to bond into a continuous occlusive sheet, with
      adhesive-like properties due to high Van der Waals forces may be
      desirable, where no additional adhesive is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [073] Rubber polymers, such as latex, synthetic rubber, and
      hypoallergenic latex, are examples of polymers with desired
      properties for both the dressing-to-skin and tube-to- dressing
      interfaces. For example, Deviant Liquid Latex from Deviant, a
      subsidiary of Envision Design, San Jose, CA and Liquid Latex
      Fashions Body Paint from Liquid Latex Fashions, Warrington, PA
      were both demonstrated to seal the dressing at both dressing
      interfaces. The drying and curing time for the latex was
      significantly reduced by applying the liquid to the skin with an
      atomization process, which is further disclosed in the sections
      below, by adding alcohol, which helps to absorb the water that
      evaporates from the latex, and/or by flowing a gas across the
      sealant for convection drying. For most applications, the
      curing/drying time was lowered to immediately (at most 1 minute)
      from the 5-10 minutes previously stated by Deviant at
      http://www.liquidlatex.net/.<br>
      <br>
      [074] Examples of suitable latex materials include Vytex Natural
      Rubber Latex (NRL), a brand of natural rubber latex produced and
      marketed by Vystar Corporation, Duluth, GA. Vytex is manufactured
      by Revertex Malaysia and distributed by Centrotrade Minerals and
      Metals, Inc. Protein test results show that Vytex NRL typically
      has 90% fewer antigenic proteins than Hevea natural rubber latex.
      Therefore, Vytex causes less exposure and developed latex
      sensitivities. The Vytex has two products with different levels of
      ammonia; ammonia is a stabilizer and preservative, and both
      functionally are feasible for the NPWT liquid sealant and drape
      components, although alternative stabilizers to ammonia may
      irritate the skin less. Liquid latex for body painting typically
      contains ammonia, which is what has been applied to patients
      during field studies with no irritations. Vytex NRL, low ammonia
      compound, has provided functional, occlusive drape and sealant
      components on clean, unwounded skin in a lab setting.<br>
      <br>
      [075] Yulex Corporation, Phoenix, AZ creates hypoallergenic latex
      from guayule (Parthenium argentatum). Yulex's guayule biorubber
      emulsions and solids have none of the sensitizing antigenic
      proteins found in traditional Hevea latex and is considered a safe
      alternative for people with Type I allergies. Yulex's biorubber
      emulsions are registered with the Personal Care Product Council
      and its INCI name is Parthenium argentatum Bark Extract. This is a
      presently preferred material for the NPWT dressing and sealant, in
      order to provide a non-allergenic material option. Yulex presently
      has ammonia and ammonia-free options.<br>
      <br>
      [076] Synthetic materials such as nitrile rubber and neoprene are
      alternatives to natural rubber that do not have allergy-provoking
      proteins, but can also generally have poor elasticity with higher
      risk of break rates and viral penetration rates. Therefore, they
      are less ideal for many of the dressing applications according to
      the present invention, but may be suitable in some circumstances,
      particularly for the drape for which curing on the skin and drying
      time are not issues. Other multi-part materials, such as Room
      Temperature Vulcanizing silicones and certain polyurethanes which
      are two-part materials with base and curative components, may be
      acceptable in some applications.<br>
      <br>
      [077] Extremely low stiffness, which is achievable with many
      rubber-type materials, increases its bonding ability through Van
      der Waals forces alone. The high elasticity capable of being
      achieved using rubber polymers accommodates for the high levels of
      tensional strain reached at the skin surface during large
      deformation body movements. Additionally, the material properties
      of rubber polymers may also accommodate for the tendency to buckle
      when compressive strains are applied, depending on any initial
      interface crack sizes and adhesion strength. A desirable sealant
      accommodates for the large variability over time and surface area
      of the skin surface strains experienced during large deformation
      human motions; in the literature, the maximum large deformation
      strain is indicated to be approximately 0.45 in tension and 0.3 in
      compression. As rubber mechanical properties are sufficient to
      achieve structural integrity, the Van der Waals adhesive
      properties determine the applicable occlusive sealants, and
      depending on the polymer, an additional adhesive may be necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [078] The liquid sealant should have viscosity and curing
      properties, preferably including minimal shrinkage, that enable it
      to conform to all contact surfaces during the application and
      curing processes, such that no air leak channels at the interface
      are present after its application. At the dressing-to-skin
      interface, the sealant should conform to the folds and creases in
      the skin that are often bridged when applying a standard, planar
      wound dressing. These types of bridged cracks at all component
      interfaces are often a significant source of air leaks into the
      system without a liquid sealant. Once a crack exists, crack
      propagation occurs in tension and compression with reduced,
      applied strains, so air leak channels can form overtime with
      reduced strain magnitudes. Therefore, eliminating any initial
      cracks at all of the interfaces is desirable. At the
      dressing-to-skin interface, structures, such as hair, often create
      opportunities for crack propagation and air leaks into a wound
      dressing, and therefore, hair is often shaved before dressing
      applications. The need to shave the hair from an infectious
      standpoint is not desirable, as the shaving process creates trauma
      at the hair follicles and increases the risk of infection. With a
      liquid sealant, these structures can be completely enclosed in the
      air-tight sealant, and therefore, are not a source of crack
      propagation under the sealant and do not typically require removal
      prior to the sealant application, as cracks at the dressing edges
      are most critical to seal, in order to resist crack propagation
      due to tension. In some constructions, adhesive on the first
      surface of the drape is sufficiently thick and/or flowable to seal
      around hairs and skin crevices and to minimize crack propagation.<br>
      <br>
      [079] The sealant thickness, number of components, wound location,
      and sealant viscosity determines the optimal sealant application
      method(s). The liquid sealant may have a very high to low
      viscosity, as long as it can completely wet the contact surfaces.
      If mechanically applied (e.g., brush or "painting" application,
      roller application, sponge/dabbing application, squeegee or other
      squeeze-type application, application by-hand (i.e., finger) with
      or without a non-stick cover, etc.), a viscosity that avoids
      run-off due to gravity is preferable in order for the sealant to
      be ergonomically applicable to any wound location. This leads to
      higher viscosities and is limited at the low viscosity range.
      Painting is not the preferred application method; when painting
      the sealant, it is difficult to achieve a constant thickness. If
      the thickness varies significantly over its surface area, the
      mechanical properties and debonding energy will also vary
      significantly, which may cause occlusive dressing failure.
      Painting also has other drawbacks, as it is easy to trap air
      bubbles in the sealant, which are a source of cracks for crack
      propagation. Also, it is difficult to produce and maintain a very
      thin coat, which significantly increases the necessary Van der
      Waals bonding strength; it increases the stiffness of the final
      dressing and decreases its ability to conform to large tissue
      strains.<br>
      <br>
      [080] Spraying is a preferred method of applying the sealant. Two
      types of spraying procedures are possible: 1) an aerosol process
      which propels the liquid sealant with a pressurized liquid or gas
      propellant that forces the liquid sealant through an atomizing
      nozzle, and 2) a shearing process which shears the liquid sealant
      with a pressurized gas or liquid causing atomization. When
      atomized, the layer of sealant material can be made thin enough
      that run-off is less of an issue, and therefore a range of lower
      viscosities can be used for their desired wetting characteristics.
      Additionally and in combination, the small atomized particles fill
      in the structures on the skin for wetting purposes. The spraying
      technique is limited at the high viscosity range, as too high of a
      viscosity sealant will not be capable of being sprayed with
      reasonable pressures and velocities for application in the
      clinical setting onto skin. However, this is not seen as a
      negative aspect since liquids with very high viscosities often do
      not properly wet the complex contours of the skin surface.<br>
      <br>
      [081] The shearing process may be preferred over the aerosol
      process. One reason for this preference is that nozzles clog
      easily with long polymer chains, unless the liquid can be further
      thinned. Using the shearing process, the shearing fluid and
      sealant fluid may be kept separate until they are both external to
      the nozzle head. Therefore, internal clogging of the nozzle does
      not occur when properly designed, including a fluid filter (if
      necessary) and the proper nozzle orifice size. Gas is the
      preferred shearing fluid, as it does not add additional liquid to
      the system for drying purposes, it is easy to propel since it can
      be compressed to high pressure levels, and it helps to dry the
      sealant when spraying it onto the skin. Higher viscosities and
      materials with long polymer chains are capable of being sprayed by
      the shearing method rather than the propellant method, although
      the viscosities and chemical chains that can be accommodated with
      the propellant method can be increased with complex nozzle design.<br>
      <br>
      [082] Additives such as curing agents, accelerators, convection
      drying agents, and adhesives may be applied via separate
      application methods, if they are not mixed with the sealant prior
      to application. Their application method may be via painting or
      spraying. The application of these additive components and the
      sealant may occur in a multi-step process. They may be stored and
      applied from separate containers with the same or different
      application methods in series or in parallel. However, they may
      also be applied in parallel or series from the same containing
      body. One example is a parallel spraying process, for which three
      ports exist: the sealant port, the shearing fluid port, and an
      accelerator port; these three components can combine during the
      atomization process in the spray nozzle where the three ports may
      interact. Another example is a spray apparatus that allows the
      amount of sealant (and potential accelerator) to be controlled,
      such that it may be shut-off; the shearing gas then becomes a
      convective drying gas.<br>
      <br>
      [083] Various polymers with rubber-like properties were determined
      to have the desired sealant properties. Additionally, a preferred
      sealant cures immediately or within a few seconds after surface
      contact. With these characteristics, the polymer tends to have
      long and heavy polymer chains, and therefore, requires the higher
      atomizing forces capable with the shearing process. As gas is used
      to atomize the polymer, there is a desirable range of gas
      pressure, velocity, and volume flow combinations that are required
      for the desired, continuous-film outcome. Filtered air, pure
      oxygen, and carbon dioxide are examples of applicable shearing
      gases that can be readily used, and are often available in the
      clinical setting at the desired pressures and volume flow rates.
      They are also readily available outside the clinical setting.
      Using these gases, the necessary, shearing atomization process is
      capable of being designed into a miniaturized handheld device.
      This process and design is similar to the consumer use of the
      aerosol embodiment commonly found in consumer products and is
      further disclosed in the Dressing <br>
      <br>
      <b>Application Methods section.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [084] The thickness of a desired seal embodiment can be built-up
      in a successive layered, lamination process. A material that has a
      strong affinity for itself with either strong Van der Waals forces
      or chemical bonds that form between its layers, such that the
      final material behaves as a continuous one-layer sealant is
      desirable. The desired thickness is the minimal thickness needed
      for strength and to achieve the desired occlusive properties,
      which is material dependent. This thickness is often thinner than
      the thickness that can be reliably and uniformly achieved through
      a painting process, and therefore a spraying process is often
      preferred. The atomization process provides a method to achieve
      the thinnest functional sealant thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [085] Occlusive dressings are beneficial beyond NPWT and in
      combination with advanced NPWT features. Some proven benefits of
      occlusive properties are highlighted here. The occlusive
      characteristic may enhance the penetration and absorption of
      topically applied medications, such as ointments, powders and
      creams, which can be beneficial in combination with standard wound
      dressings and with therapies, such as NPWT. The V.A.C. Instill
      Therapy Unit (KCI) was meant to combine instillation therapy with
      NPWT. Instillation, as defined by the V.A.C. Instill
      documentation, includes both: 1) the introduction and removal of
      topical solutions in liquid form and 2) the ability to flush out
      and clean a wound through a rigorous irrigation technique. The
      main caregiver complaint about this and other
      instillation-purposed dressings is that they often leak liquid
      during the instillation process, especially during a rigorous
      irrigation procedure, which further induces air leaks during
      continued therapy. The occlusive seal and dressings disclosed in
      this disclosure would solve any leak issues that arise. Often the
      irrigation process introduces leaks by propagating cracks in the
      dressing; by eliminating these cracks, the sealant and dressing
      techniques in this disclosure significantly reduce the potential
      for leaks and leak formation during instillation. The port(s)
      needed for instillation fluid insertion and removal can be
      directly connected to the disclosed occlusive dressing embodiments
      with the same tube-to-dressing connection methods that are
      disclosed in the Tube-to-Dressing Interface section in this
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [086] Although the presently disclosed occlusive dressings were
      developed with NPWT system in mind, they can be used for any
      application for which an occlusive (a.k.a., air tight and water
      tight), air tight, or water tight seal to the skin is desirable.
      Therefore, they are applicable in multiple fields beyond NPWT, and
      more generally in the field of skin sealants and their methods.
      Truly occlusive dressings create a control volume over the area of
      tissue that they are applied, which is a desirable feature for
      multiple applications, many which are disclosed in this
      application document.<br>
      <br>
      [087] The occlusive dressings discussed in this disclosure are the
      first skin dressings to provide a control volume, as no other
      dressing to-date is proven to be (reliably) truly occlusive. This
      would benefit the enhancement of advanced healing therapies that
      are sensitive to any variation in the environment, such as stem
      cell based therapies, for which complete control of the
      environment is necessary to achieve deterministic results. If a
      specific air leak is desirable, its rate can be precisely
      controlled into the control volume through precision valves.
      Currently, there is no accurate predetermination for the air leak
      rate into any wound dressing, especially since most dressing air
      leaks have variability over time and with body movement.
      Furthermore, truly occlusive dressings may be used in in vivo
      acute toxicity tests of dermal irritation and sensitization. The
      test animal is shaved and the test material is applied to the skin
      and wrapped in an occlusive material. The skin is then exposed
      after 23 hours and an assessment for redness and edema is made;
      this assessment is repeated 48 hours later. [088] FIG. 1 is a
      schematic expanded perspective view of a dressing assembly 20
      including a drape 22, a novel flange 26 and a tube 24 with first
      and second protective liners 28 and 30 prior to application of a
      liquid sealant according to the present invention. Drape 22 and
      second liner 30 define holes 32 and 34, respectively, through
      which tube 24 is insertable.<br>
      <br>
      [089] FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate a novel first end 40 of the tube 24
      of FIG. 1 being inserted through the novel symmetrical flange 26
      to form a tube assembly 27, FIG. 3. First end 40, also referred to
      as distal end 40, includes a spiral extension 42 which, in one
      construction, is formed by making a helical cut into the distal
      end of tube 24. In other constructions, a separate component
      having a helical shape or other geometric shape is attached to
      serve as a deterrent to clogging of distal end 40. Spiral
      extension 42 minimizes possible blockage of lumen 46 through tube
      24. Another anti-blockage construction is illustrated in FIG. 4
      with a tube distal end 60 defining perforations 62 and 64, notches
      66 and 68, and a blunt tip 70. Perforations 62 and 64 can be
      formed as diamond-shaped cutouts, circular holes, or other
      geometries. A notch 44, FIG. 2, is also created in this
      construction to further minimize the possibility for lumen 46
      through tube 24 to become obstructed, as described in more detail
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [090] Arrow 48, FIG. 2, represents distal end 40 being inserted
      through passage 50 in flange 26 defined by a sleeve region 52, a
      rotation region 54, and an adhesion region 56 having an outer edge
      57. Sleeve region 52 is adhered to tube 24, as described in more
      detail below, at a final location such as shown in FIG. 3. In
      another construction, sleeve region 52 is attached, via adhesion,
      welding or other air-tight connection process, to a short piece of
      tube with a connector that connects to a longer piece of tubing.
      In yet another construction, the flange includes an integral
      connector capable of mating with flexible tubing such as shown in
      FIG. 43. Rotation region 54 serves as a flexible ball joint in
      this construction. As depicted in FIGS. 5A and 5B, tube 24 can be
      manipulated in the direction of arrow 72, FIG. 5A, to a desired
      side orientation as shown in FIG. 5B. Lumen 46 through tube 24
      remains open in some constructions because distal end 40 extends
      beyond adhesion region 56, with notch 44 preferably below sleeve
      region 52 but above adhesion region 56, so that rotation region 54
      does not collapse onto itself. In other constructions, the flange
      is sufficiently short and wide to minimize the possibility of
      pinching closed. Sleeve region 52 is sealed in an airtight,
      fluid-impervious manner in some constructions by first applying a
      silicone adhesive, such as Liqui-Tape adhesive from Walker Tape
      Company as mentioned above, to the portion of the outer surface of
      tube 24 which will be brought in contact with sleeve region 52
      during assembly. A liquid sealant can be applied to the junction
      of tube 24 and flange sleeve region 52 to further occlude possible
      fluid escape at that junction.<br>
      <br>
      [091] In some constructions, flange 26 is manufactured directly
      onto tube 24, via a dipping, molding or spraying process. In
      constructions where flange 26 is constructed entirely from, or
      coated with, a material that has an affinity for itself, sleeve
      region 52 may self-adhere to rotation region 54 and adhesion
      region 56, to the extent that region 56 is exposed, when folded
      against itself as shown in FIG. 5B. Where the material forming the
      exterior of flange 26 has an affinity for the material of drape
      22, especially for materials containing latex compounds, the
      exterior of sleeve region 52 will also adhere to drape 22 at least
      to some extent; latex-type material applied to the surface of tube
      24 will further enhance this adhesion. Fixing the tube 24 into a
      fixed orientation such as shown in FIG. 5B may be especially
      beneficial for bed-ridden or less mobile patients so that the tube
      can be positioned to avoid the patient lying on the tubing for
      long periods of time or to avoid compromised areas around the
      wound. In other circumstances where the tube remains movable, it
      can be easily repositioned because rotation region 54 remains
      flexible and the tube can be monitored and moved frequently to
      assure that tissue is not degraded from lying on the tube in one
      position for an extended period. Especially for active patients,
      the tube 24 can be periodically re-positioned by the patient or by
      a healthcare professional.<br>
      <br>
      [092] FIGS. 6 and 7 show a drape 22 being covered by an upper
      liner 30 to manufacture a dressing according to the present
      invention. Preferably, drape 22 has a thickness ranging from 2
      microns to 0.4mm, especially in portions which will be applied to
      skin; a greater thickness in the center portion to be located over
      a wound is less critical for occlusivity. In some constructions,
      adhesive is pre-applied on the upward-facing surface shown in FIGS
      6 and 7, which will be placed in contact with skin during use; in
      other constructions, adhesive is also placed on the opposite side
      of drape 22, to be covered by liner 30, as indicated by arrow 81
      in FIG. 6, for storage and handling. The adhesive is applied as a
      uniform coating in some constructions and, in other constructions,
      as concentric circles or other non-uniform pattern. Preferably,
      liner 30 has extensions 82 and 84 which extend beyond the drape 22
      to facilitate handling of the dressing without touching any
      adhesive, and to enable easy removal of the liner 30 from the
      drape 22 after placement on a patient. <br>
      <br>
      [093] FIG. 8 shows a hole 32 punched in both layers of the
      dressing of FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      Hole 34, FIG. 1 , is not visible in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [094] FIGS. 9 and 10 shows a tube assembly 27 being inserted,
      arrow 90, onto the dressing of FIG. 8 with the adhesive region 56
      to edge 57 of the flange 26 being sealed to the drape 22 utilizing
      the pre-applied adhesive. Additional adhesive or sealant can be
      added around edge 57 or pre-applied to region 56 as desired.<br>
      [095] FIG. 11 shows a protective liner 28 being added to the
      dressing 20 of FIG.10. Protective liner 28 protects the skin-side
      adhesive, when pre-applied, until liner 28 is removed as
      illustrated in FIG. 16 below. Distal end 40 with anti-clogging
      feature 42 is sufficiently relaxed and short in length to be
      contained under liner 28. Liner 28 preferably extends beyond drape
      22 over regions 82 and 84 of liner 30.<br>
      <br>
      [096] FIG. 12 illustrates how a user can cut the dressing 20 of
      FIG. 11, along dashed line 92 using scissors 93 for example, to
      conform to a wound.<br>
      <br>
      [097] FIG. 13 shows a handling tab 94 being added, arrow 96, to
      the dressing 20 of<br>
      FIG. 12, which is especially useful if liner extensions 82 and 84
      are cut away. In this construction, tab 94 is attached by adhesive
      95 to one of liners 28 and 30 to assist removal of the selected
      liner. Additionally or as an alternative, perforations 97, 98
      create locations for easy removal of the liners. If perforations
      are utilized, it is preferred that the top and bottom liners have
      perforations that are aligned along different angles. The
      preferred angle difference is substantially perpendicular, that
      is, at about ninety degrees offset. Perforations are preferred
      when extensions 82, 84 are not provided. The dressings are very
      difficult to handle with medical gloves on, which are required for
      sterility. Therefore, handling tabs eliminate the need for the
      clinician to touch the adhesive. This is also desirable since
      powdered gloves tend to cause the adhesive to adhere to the powder
      and loose its adhesion properties. Another solution would be to
      provide non-stick finger or hand covers, such as shown in FIGS. 24
      and 25, similar to the finger sealant applicator shown in FIG. 20.
      This is especially important when dressings are re-shaped,
      potentially cutting off handling features, and when the user is
      removing the top protective liner and folding down the top folds.
      Ideally, additional handling components are built into the
      packaging components or protective liners. Such as, the package
      that the drape comes in, turns inside out to form a sterile,
      handling glove, or the bottom liner is used to maneuver the
      higher-level of adhesive interactions when dealing with the top
      liner. The bottom liner may have a cut-out (pre-perforated) glove,
      FIG. 24, with the non-stick side, e.g. silicone-coated, initially
      facing the adhesive; preferably, a non-stick coating is provided
      on both sides for both right- or left- handed application.<br>
      <br>
      [098] FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate debriding an open wound W and
      cleaning the wound cavity and surrounding skin SK, preferably at
      least 3 cm in width as indicated by dashed line 102, with standard
      cleaning methods such as with alcohol and gauze wipes. Typically,
      the next step is to pack the open wound W with fluid pervious
      material 104 such as gauze, open-cell foam or a sponge.<br>
      <br>
      [099] FIG. 16 is a perspective view of the underside of the
      dressing 20 of FIG. 11 with the liner 28 being removed as
      indicated by arrow 106, such as by pulling on corner 108, to
      expose drape 22 with pre-applied adhesive.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] FIG. 17 is a schematic top plan view of a dressing 20
      according to the present invention attached via adhesive drape 22
      to skin SK surrounding the wound. When negative pressure therapy
      is desired, a source of negative pressure is connected to tube 24
      such that its lumen is in communication with the wound cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] FIG. 18 is a schematic perspective view of the dressing 20
      of FIG. 17 with the upper protective liner 30 being removed, as
      indicated by arrow 110. Dashed line 112 represents a perforation
      or pre-cut line to assist removal of liner 30 without sliding it
      over tube 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] FIG. 19 shows liquid sealant 114 being applied to the edges
      of the drape 22 of FIG. 18. The preferred sealant embodiment has
      as width of 2-3cm and is centered over the edge of the drape 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] If the dressing is applied to contoured surfaces on the
      body, such as described below in relation to FIGS. 29-3 OA, folds
      in the planar dressing may be necessary for adhering to the
      surface of the skin, in order to match the surface contour. These
      folds typically travel from the outer edge towards the tube 24. In
      this situation, the preferred application method is to minimize
      the number of folds by creating a few large folds. Preferably,
      there are no more than four folds, divided substantially equally
      around the periphery of tube 24. These folds are created when
      adhering the drape to the surface of the skin, forming a "T".
      Then, when the top protective liner is removed, the folds are
      adhered to the surface of the drape with the adhesive on the top
      of the drape. Preferably, the folds form individual triangles on
      the top surface of the drape. The folds are then pressed to lie
      flat and be completely adhered to the surface of the drape.
      Sealant is then applied to the edge of each fold to seal off the
      area between the fold and the top of the drape from the
      surrounding environment. This additional sealant preferably
      connects with the sealant placed around the outer edge 114, FIG.
      19, for example. Preferably, the additional sealant is applied at
      substantially the same time as the original sealant with the same
      sealant material. Any drape material that would extend onto the
      skin, beyond the original edge of the drape, when folded
      preferably is cut off before pressing the folded drape material
      against the skin to lie within the original edge of the drape.
      Patterns may be provided on the upper protective liner to direct
      the user where to put the folds, when needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] FIGS. 19A and 19B illustrate modifying the coverage of a
      dressing 20a according to the present invention, with drape 22a,
      tube 24a and flange 26a. If the dressing 20a is too small to cover
      the desired skin area around the wound, preferably by 3 -5cm, for
      instance if the user cut away too much of the dressing, as shown
      by cut-out 120, while reshaping the drape for easier application
      or in order to avoid a complex contour near the wound cavity, the
      user can use sealant to reconstruct the dressing as shown by
      additional sealant 122, FIG. 19B. A modified occlusive dressing
      20a is thereby achieved. However, it is preferable for the drape
      22a itself to cover the entire wound edge, in order to protect the
      wound cavity from the sealant material.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIG. 20 is a schematic expanded view of a vial 130 of
      sealant, with closure threads 131 to receive a cap 134, with a
      non-stick finger protector 132, shown in cross- sectional view,
      preferably with a rim 133, optionally positionable within the vial
      130 for storage and transportation.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] FIGS. 21A and 21B show a dispensing apparatus 140 with
      removable cartridge 150 of liquid sealant. Dispensing apparatus
      140 has a finger trigger 142 and a nozzle 144 in this construction
      and can be powered by a cylinder of compressed gas, such as a C02
      cartridge, contained within the housing 146. Preferably, the
      apparatus is gravity fed. Because there need not be a needle
      valve, such as found in typical air guns to stop the flow of
      fluid, an adhesive tab 152, FIG. 22, is initially removed from tip
      154, and the cartridge 150 is inserted into the apparatus 140 as
      represented by arrow 149, FIG. 21B. A plug 156, FIG. 22, is then
      removed, such as by twisting, to expose an air hole at the top of
      cartridge 150 and activate apparatus 140 and allow sealant to flow
      or be sprayed out of nozzle 144. The apparatus 140 can be set
      aside temporarily, with nozzle 144 directed upwards, between
      sealant layer applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] FIG. 22 is an enlarged perspective view of the cartridge of
      FIGS. 21 A and 2 IB with internal chamber 160, raised floor 162,
      and slope 164 in this construction to assist gravity feed of
      sealant liquid to tip 154, as indicated by arrow 166. In other
      constructions, a multi-component sealant is delivered utilizing a
      separate chamber for each component. The components are mixed
      during delivery in a down-stream mixing chamber or in a mixing
      nozzle such as the 3M(TM) Scotch- Weld(TM) EPX(TM) Mixing Nozzle
      currently available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minnesota. Other
      multi-component delivery systems can be utilized such as those
      commercialized by Henkel Loctite Corporation, Rocky Hill,
      Connecticut. One or more of the sealant components can be a powder
      or other state as long as the final sealant is delivered in a
      liquid state, including as liquid droplets via shearing or a
      propellant.<br>

      chamber 180. In this construction, a removable tab 182, FIG. 23 A,
      allows air to enter chamber 180 during delivery of the sealant.<br>

      [0110] FIGS. 24 and 25 are schematic top plan views illustrating
      non-stick gloves<br>
      191 and finger covers 201 formed in liners 190 and 200,
      respectively. These applicators are non-stick, such as by a
      non-stick silicone coating, on only one side in some constructions
      and, in other constructions, are non-stick on two sides.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] FIGS. 26-28 are schematic top plan views liners 210, 220
      and 230 with indicator lines 212 and 214, 222 and 224, and 232 and
      234, respectively, having different shapes for selected locations
      and contours of a patient. Shorter lines 222 and 234 have priority
      if folds are needed; a symmetrical shape such as a square or the
      circular shape of liner 210, FIG. 26, has fold lines of equal
      priority.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] FIG. 29 is a schematic side view of a dressing 20b
      according to the present invention being applied to the heel H of
      a foot F. Flange 26b is positioned with tube 24b communicating
      with a wound in heel H. One large fold 240 is shown, with edges
      244 and 246. <br>
      <br>
      [0113] FIGS. 30 and 30A are enlarged schematic views of the
      dressing of FIG. 29 with a fold 240 being created and then pressed
      flat to enhance conformance to the heel. All edges 242, 244 and
      246 should be sealed with sealant 248 according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] There are multiple different methods of using the sealant
      described in this disclosure at the dressing-to-skin interface.
      The first method is to use the sealant in conjunction with
      current, commercial skin dressings (or dressings with similar
      embodiments), in order to achieve occlusive properties. In order
      to do this, the dressing is first applied to the skin, step 1502,
      FIG. 33, after the wound is packed, step 1501 ; typically, the
      dressing (a.k.a., drape component) is a planar adhesive tape form.
      The drainage tube may enter into the dressing at the
      dressing-to-skin interface, or it may have its own connector that
      requires an incision into the dressing above the wound cavity,
      step 1503. The dressing system is applied with its recommended
      procedure. Then, all dressing-to-skin interfaces are sealed with
      the sealant and potentially additional adhesive, step 1504.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] At the dressing-to-skin interface, the sealant contact with
      the skin should be biocompatible. The sealant should conform to
      and seal off the folds and creases in the skin, which are often
      bridged when applying a standard, planar wound dressing. These
      cracks are a significant source of air leaks into the system
      without a liquid sealant with the proper wetting properties. The
      proper wetting properties are achieved by applying the liquid
      sealant directly to the skin and dressing in its liquid form
      through a painting process or through spraying the liquid with an
      atomization process that eliminates liquid run-off and that may
      achieve a more uniform, thin film.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Once a crack in the planar dressing exists, crack
      propagation may occur in tension and compression with reduced,
      applied strains. Therefore, sealing any initial cracks in the
      dressing-to-skin interface is desirable. Also, properly sealing
      the dressing-to-skin interface at the edge of the dressing deters
      any air leaks from future crack propagations, as the sealant
      hinders the propagation from reaching the outside environment. If
      an additional adhesive is used between the sealant and
      dressing-to-skin interface, then the adhesive should adhere to the
      skin, dressing, and sealant to form the necessary bond strength.
      The adhesive or its applied components should also conform to the
      folds and creases in the skin and/or dressing. The adhesive should
      be compatible with the skin, dressing, and sealant when applying
      the adhesive under the sealant, or when mixing the sealant with an
      adhesive component prior to application.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Use of the liquid sealant can permit elimination of the
      current commercial dressings (or similar dressing embodiments;
      a.k.a., the drape component). The liquid sealant can be applied
      directly over the wound cavity and wound packing material. In some
      embodiments, the packing material may require an additional liquid
      tight barrier if the liquid sealant can be absorbed into the
      packing material. Additionally, a liquid tight barrier may need to
      exist at the interface between the packing material and the wound
      edge, as the sealant could potentially leak into this barrier,
      depending on the application technique of the packing material,
      which may not be desirable. A gap at the interface between the
      packing material and the wound edge may be disruptive to the
      sealant in creating a continuously occlusive film, or the
      potential of the sealant contacting the inside tissue of the wound
      cavity may need to be eliminated. These barriers may be of an
      occlusive nature; in this case, the sealant should be applied at
      any of their non-occlusive edges; however, the sealant may also
      cover the entire surface area, which may help to maintain the
      adhesion of the barriers. The barriers can be made of multiple
      materials from adhesive and non-adhesive polymer films to clays
      and pastes, for example. Barriers mentioned in this description
      are different from the standard wound dressings, as the standard
      wound dressings' adhesion to the skin forms structural and
      adhesion integrities of the dressing-to-skin interface, and the
      barriers currently discussed are used to protect the wound from
      the sealant component and are not necessarily intended to provide
      any structural support beyond that purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Maceration of the skin under a truly occlusive dressing may
      be of concern to the caregiver. This can be solved with a material
      selection solution, as a one-way, directional occlusive sealant
      material can be used that allows the skin to breathe and its
      moisture to evaporate without letting air into the system. Similar
      material properties are commonly found today in materials used for
      sports apparel. Additionally, this can be solved from a design
      perspective. The sealant application area can be made narrow
      enough that the moisture of the tissue under the dressing can
      diffuse around the seal. If a larger surface area of seal adhesion
      is necessary, a web of sealant can be applied to allow diffusion
      around the webbing. Additionally, the sealant can vary in
      thickness via the atomization process, where a thick enough
      dressing for occlusive properties is sprayed around the wound edge
      or dressing-to-skin interface. This application can maintain a
      narrow width, and then the rest of the dressing can be made into a
      thinner layer that is breathable based on a different number of
      lamination layers or by using different spraying variables and
      techniques. This thinner part of the dressing can maintain a
      continuous film embodiment with the occlusive barrier, as the
      debonding energy of the thinner part is significantly decreased
      due to the reduction in thickness, increasing the effective bond
      strength. Additionally, this breathable component can be webbed
      over the surface, instead of encompassing a continuous film
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The tube-to-dressing interface should be sealed if the
      connection is not prefabricated to be occlusive during its
      manufacturing process, as it is in the Spiracur dressing. The
      sealant should bond to both materials found at the
      tube-to-dressing interface and form an occlusive seal spanning the
      interface, step 1504, FIG. 33. Three methods can be used for this
      sealant interface and its components: 1) dressing components that
      were not originally prefabricated to be occlusive can be
      pre-assembled and sealed prior to dressing application (most
      desirable from an occlusive results reliability perspective); 2)
      dressing components can be preassembled prior to dressing
      application, but the seal is applied after dressing application;
      or 3) the tube connection method is fabricated and sealed to the
      dressing during or post dressing application.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The first method provides the user with a method to
      prefabricate a custom dressing that has an occlusive
      tube-to-dressing interface. This eliminates many potential air
      leaks, and for the first time, allows custom, prefabricated,
      occlusive dressings to be made in the clinical setting. Method two
      is convenient if the liquid sealant is the same for all dressing
      interfaces; therefore, all the interfaces (tube-to-dressing and
      dressing-to-skin) can be sealed in one step after the dressing
      application. However, this method requires that the pre- assembly
      configuration is stable during its application, before any sealant
      is applied. For method three, less prep-work needs to be performed
      by the caregiver. If this sealant method is ergonomic and
      repeatable without any prefabrication, then this method can
      significantly cut-down on dressing time, which is a significant
      personnel and cost savings for the care center. The ergonomic and
      repeatable characteristics depend on the tubing connector designs.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Multiple tubing connector designs can be manufactured for
      sealing purposes to be used for all three methods. Three basic
      design concepts can span many embodiments. These three design
      concepts are: <br>
      <br>
      [0122] 1) Puncture the dressing with the drainage tube, such that
      the drape fits snuggly against the tube. Then, apply the sealant
      at the tube-to-dressing interface. With this method, the tube can
      recess into the wound cavity at a custom length as indicated by
      extended distal end 1801, FIG. 36. If the adhesion force of the
      sealant needs to be increased, an additional adhesive can be added
      under the sealant or mixed with the sealant, or the tubing and/or
      dressing can be pre-coated with a material that the sealant has an
      affinity for. In practice, rubberized polymers typically have a
      strong affinity towards themselves, even if the under layer is
      previously cured. Multiple drainage holes, as illustrated in FIG.
      4, or a spiraled cut pattern, FIGS. 2 and 3, in the portion of the
      tube extending into the dressing is preferred, in order to prevent
      the tube from occluding against saturated packing material or with
      particles in the wound exudate.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] 2) The same concept as in concept 1, except with a
      different tube entry into the dressing. This concept is for the
      case where an initial planar dressing is used. Two pieces of the
      planar dressing cover the wound from two different sides, and they
      meet above the wound cavity in a "T" joint. The tube is placed
      through this "T" joint into the wound cavity before the "T" joint
      is sealed. Then, all of the interfaces are sealed with the liquid
      sealant.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] 3) The same concept as in concept 1, except at the
      tube-to-dressing interface, a prefabricated foot 1802, FIG. 36,
      also referred to herein as a flange, is attached (preferably
      air-tight) to the tube in order to provide a planar surface to
      seal to the dressing. In one functional embodiment, the foot 1802
      is made of a flexible material that the sealant has a strong
      affinity for and no additional adhesive is necessary. The material
      of the foot may be tapered in thickness, such that it thins to
      meet at its edge(s) with the dressing, which may be more desirable
      for reliable, occlusive sealant application. The tube can connect
      to this foot 1802 in many orientations; however, it is often
      preferable to minimize the dressing profile. However, often when
      minimizing the dressing profile, the tube is in an orientation
      that cannot be readjusted after dressing application. Therefore,
      the tube may connect perpendicular to the skin surface, and by
      using non-kink tubing and/or the flexibility of the foot 1802
      material allows the tube to be oriented in any orientation post
      dressing application, such that the tube will not kink and occlude
      itself. For this concept, the tube may not puncture the drape, but
      instead, the hole (a.k.a., incision) may be pre-cut; the foot
      should extend beyond the hole (a.k.a., incision). <br>
      <br>
      [0125] 4) The fourth concept is the similar to concept 3, except
      the tubing does not extend into the wound cavity, FIG. 37.
      Therefore, an incision is made into the dressing, and the tube
      opening is positioned over the center of the incision, as in the
      T.R.A.C. Pad. The foot should extend beyond the incision and is
      sealed to the dressing with the liquid sealant or occlusively
      pre-sealed during its manufacture. In this embodiment, the end of
      the tube should be designed to stop potential occlusion onto the
      foot, onto packing materials, or with wound exudate substances.
      Therefore, if the foot is connected to the tube above the skin
      surface, the end of the tube may have a spiral cut along its
      length, up to its interface (intersection of the upper portion of
      foot 1802 and tube distal end 1901 in FIG. 37) with the foot.
      Additionally, an anti-occluding material may be placed at the end
      of the tube between the foot and the dressing. This anti-occlusive
      material may be a large pore, open cell sponge.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In the tube-to-dressing connection, as with all sealed
      interfaces, an additional adhesive may be added if the bonding
      strength needs to be increased. The foot may also be initially
      adhered with a tape or adhesive to the dressing prior to sealant
      application. The tube connectors can exist in many similar
      embodiments to those listed above; however, a limited number of
      examples are given here in order to illustrate the basic
      connections and the occlusive dressings. The tube-to-dressing
      interface may be occlusively pre-sealed during its manufacture.
      Additionally, the component attached at the interface may only
      consist of a tube connector (which may or may not contain a
      segment of tubing) that is additionally connected to a longer
      piece of tubing that then attaches to the pump. Examples of
      occlusive tube connectors are barbed connectors that connect
      directly with a tube, specific connectors that interlock with each
      other and are required on each end of the connected components,
      and a compression fit seal such as a cylindrical hole in rubber
      that the tube can be occlusively pressed into.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] As previously stated, handling a dressing with a planar
      tape embodiment may cause the adhesive to weaken prior to dressing
      application. Therefore, specific handling devices for the
      caregiver can be included with this dressing component. These
      devices may include non-stick gloves, such as PTFE gloves, FIG.
      24, or non-stick fingertips, FIGS. 20 and 25. Handing tabs that
      extend from the dressing may also be incorporated into the
      dressing design. These tabs may be a part of the dressing (a.k.a.,
      drape) that are torn-off after applying the dressing, or they may
      be extensions of a removable backing material that is attached to
      the dressing as shown in FIG. 13. [0128] For application of the
      sealant, many application embodiments and methods are possible.
      For mechanical applications, including painted applications, the
      applicator embodiment can be a brush, roller, sponge, spatula, or
      other similar embodiment to apply paint in a "spreading" fashion.
      These spreading devices can be attached to a container (preferably
      refillable) of liquid sealant for a continuous feed of sealant to
      the applicator; this may be gravity fed (passive or user
      controlled), or the applicator may be prepped with sealant by
      dipping the applicator into a container of sealant. Although
      painting is not the preferred application method for the liquid
      dressing, it may be preferred if a high viscous sealant material
      is used to span large gaps, such as that between the packing
      material and the wound edge, the potentially high ridges of a
      hydrocolloid at its skin interface, or the large creases, gaps,
      and folds in a hydrocolloid dressing, due to its high stiffness
      and thickness and geometrical mismatch.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] For sprayed applications, the device to atomize the sealant
      with a shearing process can be a refillable spray gun or airbrush,
      with an external pressurized gas supply, or this functionality can
      be incorporated into a miniature, handheld spray can, which can be
      rechargeable and refillable. Each embodiment has a design specific
      envelope of pressure, velocity and volume flow of gas that is
      required to shear the sealant, such that it forms a thin film,
      continuous layer on the skin. If the operation is outside the
      envelope, the droplets of the spray may be too large and will not
      spray as a continuous layer, but will sputter onto the skin, or
      the gas may not shear the fluid out of the fluid opening. In a
      functional embodiment, the liquid sealant is gravity fed into a
      center opening in a nozzle, and pressurized gas shears the sealant
      through a circumferential ring around the sealant nozzle opening.
      Multiple nozzles may exist for one or both fluids. Particularly,
      the spray pattern may be controlled through the shearing of the
      sealant from multiple gas ports, aimed in different shearing
      directions across the liquid sealant nozzle. In a handheld device,
      the pressurized gas may be generated from a miniature gas
      cylinder, such as a high pressure, liquid carbon dioxide
      cartridge. The spraying device may be charged by the caregiver
      when he or she activates the charged canister of gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Once the dressing-to-skin and tube-to-dressing interfaces
      are sealed (either during dressing application or during its
      manufacture), the caregiver should monitor the pump to assure that
      air is not leaking into the system above a predetermined
      threshold, typically zero, step 1505, FIG. 33. This can be done
      visually, for example, by monitoring the expansion of the pump
      (a.k.a., mechanical pump) or with an air leak test that is further
      disclosed in the pump descriptions, or it can be sensed using
      pressure sensors to detect the vacuum pressure over time
      (particularly, with a mechanical pump, if the pressure changes
      continuously with internal pump volume). If too high of an air
      leak exists, the dressing-to- skin and/or tube-to-dressing
      interfaces can be resealed with the liquid sealant by removing the
      previously applied sealant material, or overlaying the new sealant
      over the previously applied seal material, step 1506, FIG. 33.
      This is an iterative process until the desired air leak threshold
      is achieved, step 1507.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] When a truly occlusive wound dressing is used for NPWT, the
      behavior of the system changes from an active flow system, FIG.
      34A, to a passive flow system 1602, FIG. 34B. When air leaks,
      arrows 1603, FIG. 34A into the active system, the system has an
      active flow of fluid (both air and wound exudate) that both
      removes the exudate from the wound cavity 1604 and tends to dry
      out the wound cavity. With an air-tight system 1602, FIG. 34B, the
      flow of the exudate toward the pump is no longer an active flow,
      but tends to build up, 1605, even into the tube over time,
      maintaining a passive flow to the vacuum source. A pressure
      differential still exists at the surface of the wound bed 1606
      and, thus, negative pressure is still being applied to the wound
      bed; however, the wound cavity volume 1604 fills with exudate
      fluid 1605 over time. This characteristic may have increased
      healing benefits compared to standard NPWT, as it maintains a
      moist, healing environment at the wound site, while also
      maintaining NPWT vacuum pressure benefits.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] With this build-up of fluid 1605, FIGS. 34B and 35, the
      dressing-to-skin interface adhesion 1607 may be compromised over
      time by the exudate, and the exudate may eventually undermine the
      dressing and leak out of the dressing-to-skin interface. The rate
      of exudate removal, size of the wound cavity, and time between
      dressing changes determine the build-up characteristics. If there
      is a chance that the dressing may be compromised, it can be
      prevented with multiple methods, including:<br>
      <br>
      [0133] 1) A sealant or additional adhesive that can withstand the
      exudate build-up may be applied. For this case, the sealant and/or
      additional adhesive should be applied as close to the wound edge
      as possible. This is difficult if a standard dressing was used.
      Planar dressings typically leak over the three-day dressing period
      if fluid build-up occurs. This is because the exudate often
      degrades the adhesive by undermining the dressing at the wound
      edge at the locations of initial creases in the dressing.
      Therefore, a dressing without initial cracks at the wound edge is
      preferred; however, the dressing application described in the
      previous section only seals the outer edge of the dressing. To
      solve this problem, a flexible adhesive, with flexibility and
      adhesive properties such as those of a 30+ day silicon wig glue,
      may be initially applied at the wound edge under the adhesive
      planar dressing. This can fill in any initial cracks at the wound
      edge and prevent exudate-caused degradation.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] 2) A barrier can be applied at the wound edge, after the
      wound packing material is inserted. This barrier may be made of
      highly absorbent material, in order to reduce the chance of
      overspill of exudate due to factors, such as gravitational
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] 3) The tube end can be recessed into the wound cavity below
      the plane of the surface of the skin 1702, as indicated by arrow
      1701, FIG. 35. Therefore, the drainage line of fluid 1703, and
      hence the build-up of exudate will not build-up to the wound edge
      1607, and degrade the adhesive. This technique may not be possible
      if the wound is superficial.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] 4) A purge valve to let a controlled, temporary air leak
      into the dressing system to clear the fluid can be incorporated
      into the dressing system. This valve can be incorporated using the
      same connection methods as described in the Tube-to-Dressing
      Interface section in this disclosure. This would cause the fluid
      to actively flow into the fluid collection canister during the
      initial pressure drop in the system. The pump can be reset, if
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] 5) The wound packing material can be made from materials
      with a low resistance to the flow of exudate and a low absorption,
      which would encourage the fluid to passively move through the
      system at a faster rate in a path more direct to the drainage
      tube. Depending on the rate of exudate removal, this may not fix
      the problem if it is a very low rate. In this case, the packing
      material should be designed to direct flow to the drainage tube
      and specifically away from the wound edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] 6) If the dressing is fabricated completely out of the
      liquid sealant (potentially with an additional adhesive) with no
      planar dressing component, then no cracks will exist at the wound
      edge when it is properly applied, and therefore, no cracks will
      initially exist for the exudate to undermine.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Although any mechanical or electrical vacuum source may be
      applied to the occlusive dressings in this disclosure, a
      mechanical system may be preferred due to the significant benefits
      over electrical pumps. Mechanical vacuum pumps and methods are
      provided for medical application in negative pressure wound
      therapy ( PWT) that would be compatible with the disclosed
      dressings. A number of known pumps are described by the present
      inventor in "Development of a simplified Negative Pressure Wound
      Device" submitted in 2007 for her Master of Science in Mechanical
      Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The pump
      is initially set and then governed by a linear or nonlinear spring
      force. The pump enclosure may act as a collection chamber;
      however, a separate collection chamber may exist in series with
      the pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] In one embodiment, the pump is a plastic bellows, shown in
      FIG. 31, where the enclosure and spring can be the same component.
      The pump is compressed manually and then attached to the tube of
      the wound dressing. A negative pressure is applied through
      expansion of the bellows due to the spring characteristics of its
      material and design. The pressure gradient of the device
      continuously decreases over the expansion of the standard bellows
      due to its linear spring-like properties. Referring to the above
      description, one skilled in the art would realize that other
      embodiments exist: the device could be constructed of a different
      material bellows, and/or the device could contain an additional
      spring 5 in parallel with the bellows in order to vary the spring
      constant without changing the material properties and design of
      the bellows itself. If there are no air leaks into the system,
      then the bellows would remain at a constant expansion length, and
      therefore, at a constant pressure. The bellows can be collapsed to
      any desired therapy pressure from maximum compression to zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] In addition to the standard bellows, another embodiment of
      bellows can resemble a constant force spring, in order to decrease
      the pressure gradient. In one embodiment of this design, the
      bellows resembles a long tube that, when fully compressed, is
      rolled onto itself, similar to a tape measure, as shown in FIG.
      32. As it unrolls and expands from its flattened to open
      cross-section, it creates negative pressure in the tube to which
      it is connected. For the tube to unroll following the expansion of
      the bellows, the spring constant of the bellows must be higher
      than the spring constant of the constant force spring unrolling.
      The unrolling can also be mechanically dampened, for example by
      adhesion, or forced to unroll after expansion by structural
      limiters. In this embodiment, a long, cylindrical tube can replace
      the bellows, as it presents similar characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] In all of the pumps described above, orientation of the
      device is independent of the magnitude of negative pressure pulled
      and the proper operation of the device. Therefore, the device is
      highly transportable. Referring to the above descriptions, one
      skilled in the art would realize that other embodiments exist;
      however, only selected embodiments are described in detail. To
      change pressures in a pump design, separate pumps can be made with
      different material properties and/or dimensions, or components can
      be swapped for different pressure results.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The negative pressure generated is governed by the material
      and mechanical properties of the container and/or balloon and the
      spring constant. Using a non-constant force spring (such as a
      common linear spring 5, FIG. 31, the pump may be used for negative
      pressure wound therapy that does not require a specific, constant
      pressure (in the case that the internal volume of the pump is
      expected to expand), although the variance in pressure can be
      reduced through material property selection and design. Using a
      constant force spring with a constant area, a constant vacuum
      pressure can be pulled throughout treatment, even if there is a
      change in the internal volume of the pump. This is the basis for
      design of the rolling bellows (FIG. 32), and the syringe concept
      discussed in the next section. Additionally, a more constant
      pressure with pump expansion can be achieved with a non- constant
      force spring by designing the force/area ratio to be constant,
      such as the balloon design with a small (constant) diameter to
      length ratio and a bellows with a varying cross- sectional area.
      Additionally, constant pressure can be achieved over time if no
      air leaks into the system, causing geometrical changes in the pump
      configuration. In this case, the pumps should be made out of
      materials that do not degrade when applying negative pressure
      overtime due to properties such as stress relaxation.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The pump is initially set and then governed by gravity. It
      includes an expansion container that expands due to an applied
      force such as a weight. The pump enclosure may act as a collection
      chamber; however, a separate collection chamber may exist in
      series with the pump. In one embodiment, the pump includes a
      rolling diaphragm syringe (similar to a friction free diaphragm
      air cylinder). Negative pressure amplitude is governed by the
      diameter of the syringe and the magnitude of the attached weight.
      One skilled in the trade would realize that a similar device could
      also be constructed of any sealed piston syringe. Referring to the
      above descriptions, the device could also include a linear spring
      in parallel with the syringe or a constant force spring in series
      with the syringe for expansion, eliminating the need for weight.
      This embodiment would then fall under the spring governed pumps
      described in the previous section. A rolling diaphragm can also be
      achieved using a rubber ball design. One hemisphere of the rubber
      ball is held rigid in its inflated position, such as by bonding it
      to the inside of a rigid hemisphere, and the other hemisphere is
      compressed into it. The embodiment of the pump resembles a bowl.
      Then, the bowl is oriented so that its hollow side is facing down.
      A weight is hung from the ball (i.e., a rubber ball) on the hollow
      inside of the hemisphere, and the wound drainage tube is connected
      to the internal volume of the pump (preferably through the top of
      the rigid hemisphere). The weight pulls a negative pressure as the
      ball returns back to the shape of a sphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Another embodiment for a gravity governed pump is created
      by a siphon. The pump enclosure may act as a collection chamber;
      however, a separate collection chamber may exist in series with
      the pump. The pressure pulled is equal to:<br>
      <br>
      rho*g*h (2)<br>
      <br>
      wherein rho is the density of the fluid in the column, g being the
      gravitational constant, and h being the height of the column). The
      fluid should be compatible with the wound (such as saline), unless
      a check valve is used to assure separation of the pump fluid from
      the wound cavity. The pump can be configured in two ways,
      depending on the patient situation and the desired pressure:<br>
      <br>
      [0146] 1. The pump can include a column of fluid that exists in a
      tube directly connected to the wound. The lower (preferably
      closed-expandable) container of fluid can rest at the desired
      height on a separate mechanism (such as a hanging hook or floor),
      or could be attached to a lower extremity of the patient, again at
      the desired height. The diameter of the tube would determine the
      pressure gradient: the larger the diameter, the lower the pressure
      gradient as fluid is collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] 2. The pump can include two bodies of fluid with a tube
      from the higher body of fluid to the wound. The mobility of the
      patient would be determined by the tube length and the mechanism
      used to carry the pump (for instance, a rolling stand could be
      used). The diameter of the higher container would determine the
      pressure gradient: the larger the diameter, the lower the pressure
      gradient as fluid is collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Integrating the spring governed pumps with the gravity
      governed concept allows for further performance. Then, the
      magnitude of negative pressure a spring governed pump can obtain
      is not completely limited by the material properties of the
      container, the design, and the spring constant combination.
      Additional weights can be attached to one end of the pump in
      series with the spring, in order to pull a higher negative
      pressure. (For the bladder concept, portions of the bladder may
      need structural support, so mat the bladder does not collapse on
      itself as the weight acts on it.) The weights should be attached
      between the pump and ground. Even though in this form the
      orientation of the pump should be maintained, varying the
      additional weight is a simple solution to achieving multiple
      pressures beyond that of the original pump properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] A container evacuation pump is not continuously governed by
      a force exerted on the container. Instead, the pump is simply an
      evacuated rigid chamber that is continuously monitored through a
      pressure gauge, such as gauge 4 in FIGS. 31 and 32. Alternatively,
      a mechanical check gauge would be used, with an optimal pressure
      range. When the vacuum pressure decreases to a certain,
      predetermined level, a notification mechanism is activated and the
      rigid chamber is recharged. Recharging can be by a pump or by
      human suction. In this embodiment, the rigid chamber can act as
      the collection container, or a separate non-structural, expandable
      container can be inserted into the rigid chamber that is directly
      connected to the wound drainage tube. An expandable collection
      chamber can be integrated into any of the mechanical pump concepts
      disclosed in this disclosure, in order to collect the fluid inside
      the pump body, acting as a collection liner instead of a
      completely separate collection canister.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] To administer NPWT, the pump is connected to the wound
      drainage tube, and the container is then evacuated. Air leaks and
      wound drainage rate determines the pressure gradient, and the
      pressure range is determined by the maximum pressure pumped and
      the recharge notification pressure. The maximum pressure pumped
      can be limited by a pressure activated inlet valve.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] As generally applies to all of the above-mentioned pumps, a
      sequence of steps should be followed. First, the tube connected
      directly to the dressing should be clamped shut between the
      dressing and the collection chamber, preferably at the collection
      chamber end. Then, the pump and collection chamber should be
      disconnected. If necessary, the collection chamber should be
      emptied, and/or the proper sterilization procedures should be
      performed; component 8, FIG. 31, represents a rubber plug, not
      shown because integral floor 260 is utilized instead, for
      increased access to the interior of the collection chamber in an
      alternative construction. The pump should then be reset, and the
      pump and collection chamber reconnected to the tube. Remove the
      clamp to begin NPWT again. If a dressing change is also desired,
      there is no need to use a clamp to keep the dressing sealed. Also,
      if the collection chamber does not need to be emptied and/or
      sterilized, then the tube should be clamped between the dressing
      and the pump, preferably after the collection chamber if it is
      separate from the pump at the pump end of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] An air leak test can be incorporated into the mechanical
      pumps, except for the first (1) siphon concept. In the second (2)
      siphon concept, the higher container is turned upside-down for the
      initial air leak test. Most air leaks originate at the dressing
      interfaces. In a purely mechanical pump, air leaks fill the
      limited volume, causing the maximum time between pump resets to
      decrease. To eliminate these air leaks and create a reliable,
      repeatable therapy, devices according to the present disclosure
      may include an air leak test. By using the air leak test, the
      purely mechanical pumps have been proven to be capable of lasting
      throughout the recommended timeframe between dressing changes (3
      days). However, this test is not necessary for the occlusive seals
      and dressings disclosed in this disclosure, but can provide a
      visual reassurance to the caregiver and patient that the dressing
      was applied properly and no significant leaks exist in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The air leak test is in the collection chamber. The tube
      from the wound that enters into the collection chamber enters into
      a wound compatible solution (such as saline). When applying the
      NPWT, one should confirm that the end of the tube is submerged in
      the solution and should look at the solution for air bubbles B,
      FIGS. 31 and 32, (any air that initially exists in the tube may
      create air bubbles; therefore, one should wait about 1-2 seconds
      for additional air bubbles). If air bubbles are detected, the
      dressing should be sealed until no air bubbles are detected. This
      resealing may be to completely redress the wound, to smooth out
      the air leaks in the current dressing, or to reinforce the current
      dressing with additional dressing components. Once no air bubbles
      are detected, the pump may need to be reset depending on how much
      air entered into the pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] A safety feature of the collection chamber is to limit the
      amount of liquid capable of being collected. If the collected
      liquid were blood due to destruction of a vein or artery, there
      exists a possibility that the patient may die due to fatal
      bleeding. The collection chamber should be limited to less than
      300cc of liquid to keep the patient at a safe range from possible
      exsanguination. Therefore, if the pump design can pull more than
      300cc of fluid, a safety feature should be implemented. If the
      pump acts as the collection chamber, the safety feature should
      limit its expansion volume. This can be done in various ways
      through the introduction of limiting, internal (FIG. 31, component
      6) and/or external (FIG. 31, component 7) structural components.
      If an external collection chamber exists, then a safety feature
      should stop the negative pressure after 300cc is collected. This
      can be done by "plugging" the system with a mechanism, such as a
      float-stop valve.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Prior to the existence of a truly occlusive dressing, a
      benefit in the external collection chamber was that the pump can
      be larger than 300cc, and therefore, account for more air leaks
      into the system. However, with a truly occlusive dressing, the
      benefits include that the external collection chamber and its
      fluids can be easily removed for lab testing purposes, and the
      pump requires a less rigorous cleaning procedure between dressing
      changes. However, these benefits are more readily solved with a
      volume specific container with no rigidity, and containing no
      initial volume of fluid that may contaminate a exudate sample, if
      desired, that can be inserted into any of the mechanical pump
      concepts disclosed in this disclosure, in order to collect the
      fluid inside the pump body, acting as a collection liner instead
      of a completely separate collection canister. The 300cc limitation
      is recommended for the average adult; however, the limitation
      volume may vary based on the patient. This volume variation can be
      designed into multiple pump or collection chamber sizes, or into a
      single, limit adjustable pump or collection chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] Another pump safety feature is a one-way valve incorporated
      in the tube between the wound and the collection chamber, such as
      component 2, FIGS. 31 and 32. This mechanism assures that fluid
      from the pump and collection chamber does not flow back into the
      dressing. It also can be used as the tube clamping mechanism for
      resetting the pump or emptying the collection chamber, depending
      on placement in the tube. This mechanism can also be incorporated
      into the tube connector on the collection chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Another mechanism that may be included is used to evacuate
      the initial air found in the system after no air leaks are
      detected. The current method is to clamp the tube near the pump
      and to reset the pump until the initial air is evacuated from the
      system. This can also be accomplished by including a one-way-
      valve incorporated into the tube connector on the pump, such as
      component 2, FIGS. 31 and 32, and another one-way-valve
      incorporated between the interior cavity of the pump and
      atmosphere, component 3, shown with a cap C in FIG. 31. With this
      design, one can continue to compress (reset) the pump until the
      desired vacuum is maintained; the system does not need to be
      disconnected. The one-way-valve open to atmosphere can be capped
      after therapy begins. <br>
      <br>
      [0158] This mechanism cannot be easily integrated to eliminate the
      need for resetting the pump in the design that includes a rubber
      balloon that is inserted into an orifice of an air-tight container
      and the two siphon pumps. For the balloon design, a connection to
      the container can be made to incorporate the attachment of a
      separate pump with the oneway-valve and check valve design. This
      pump can be attached for initial balloon inflation and container
      evacuation, and then detached between dressing changes. In the two
      siphon concepts, a pump can be attached to evacuate the space
      above the column of fluid, raising the fluid level to the desired
      height. The pump can be detached for extended therapy, between
      dressing changes.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] An individual sealant component may be packaged by itself
      to make any skin dressing occlusive. Alternatively, the sealant
      can be packaged as part of a mechanical NPWT kit, including a
      mechanical pump and its pre-attached components, tubing with
      flexible foot and pre-attached tubing connector and optional one
      way valve, dressing adhesive film to cover the packing material
      (if necessary), the sealant material in a handheld spray
      container, a wound packing material, and skin prep (if necessary).
      Additionally, if there is an adhesive dressing tape-like film that
      should be handled by the caregiver, then non-stick fingertip
      covers maybe included for better adhesion outcomes. Non-powdered
      gloves may also be included, so that the Van der Waals forces for
      sealant attachment are not altered due to powder on the skin
      surface. One skilled in the art would realize that kit components
      may be swapped for their different functional embodiments,
      discussed above. Also, additional components may be added or put
      into additional kits that are used in typical dressing changes,
      such as wound debridement tools, or additional wound therapies,
      such as medications with their corresponding introduction and
      (potentially) removal ports through the dressing, into the wound
      cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] As many dressing systems are identified in this disclosure,
      one skilled in the art would realize that the liquid sealing
      method can be used in combination with any tissue (a.k.a., skin)
      dressing in order to create an air-tight seal. As many pumps are
      identified in this disclosure, one skilled in the art would
      realize that any pump combined with the occlusive dressing systems
      would have similar performance characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] One technique according to the present invention for
      constructing an occlusive dressing over a wound includes at least
      one of (1) packing the wound with a fluid- pervious material and
      (2) covering at least a portion of the wound with a protective
      material. The method further includes applying, such as by
      spraying, an organic material, preferably elastomeric, that is in
      a liquid state, and is at least partially cross-linked at least
      after one of drying and curing, over the packed material and onto
      skin surrounding the wound to create an occlusive drape as a thin
      sheet substantially impervious to fluid transfer, having a first,
      inner surface and a second, outer surface. As utilized herein, the
      term "organic material" includes matter in various forms that
      include carbon atoms, including silicone rubbers. The method
      includes at least one of drying and curing the elastomeric
      material within thirty minutes after application of the
      elastomeric material as a layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] FIG. 38 is a schematic top plan view of the wound shown in
      FIG. 14, here with a cleaned skin zone indicated by dashed line
      302 and with packing material 304, such as gauze or a sponge.
      Additionally, a protective covering material 306 is applied over
      the wound when intended liquid drape material has a sufficiently
      lower viscosity and longer set time to be absorbed into the
      packing material 304. Protective material 306 prevents liquid
      drape material from flowing into the wound cavity. In some
      constructions, protective material 306 is a solid impermeable or
      semi-permeable polymeric sheet, which may be utilized with or
      without adhesive. In other constructions, protective material 306
      is a claylike substance that can be molded and packed over packing
      material 304 and around a tube inserted into the packing material
      304.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] FIG. 39 is a view of FIG. 38 with a hole 308 cut in the
      protective covering 306, if an opening in the protective covering
      306 has not already been formed or maintained.<br>

      [0164] FIG. 40 is a view of FIG. 39 with a tube assembly 27c, with
      tube 24c and flange 26c, having sleeve 52d, rotation region 54d
      and adhesion region 56d, placed over the hole 308. Tube assembly
      27c is maintained in position with adhesive in some techniques
      and, in other techniques, is manually held in place.
      Alternatively, tube 24c can directly puncture protective covering
      306 such that covering 306 maintains a tight seal around tube 24c,
      potentially with an additional seal barrier such as clay or
      adhesive. In another construction, flange 26c is sufficiently
      large in diameter to completely cover the wound.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] FIG. 41 is a view of FIG. 40 with liquid drape material 310
      applied over the protective covering 306 and onto surrounding skin
      SK to cover skin zone 302 to thereby construct a dressing
      according to the present invention. The liquid drape material 310
      is applied by spraying or application technique such that material
      310 firmly attaches to skin SK surrounding the wound and covers
      any protective cover layer 306, if utilized, as well as creating
      an air-tight seal around flange 26d. FIG. 42 is a schematic
      perspective view of the dressing of FIG. 41 In other
      constructions, the drape is constructed directly onto a tube
      without utilizing a separate flange.<br>

      [0166] FIG. 43 is a schematic perspective view of a novel flange
      26d according to the present invention with integral connector 320
      having a barb-type engagement feature 322 defining passage 324.
      Engagement feature 322 is insertable into end of a tube.<br>

      Application of a vacuum pump using a foam dressing to a wound<br>
      <br>
      Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a therapeutic technique
      using a vacuum dressing to promote healing in acute or chronic
      wounds and enhance healing of first and second degree burns. The
      therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric
      pressure to the local wound environment,[1] using a sealed wound
      dressing connected to a vacuum pump.[2][3] The use of this
      technique in wound management increased dramatically over the
      1990s and 2000s[4] and a large number of studies have been
      published examining NPWT.[5] NPWT appears to be useful for
      diabetic ulcers[6] and management of the open abdomen (laparotomy)
      [7] but further research is required for other wound types.[8]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      NPWT promotes wound healing by applying a vacuum through a special
      sealed dressing. The continued vacuum draws out fluid from the
      wound and increases blood flow to the area.[2] The vacuum may be
      applied continuously or intermittently, depending on the type of
      wound being treated and the clinical objectives. Typically, the
      dressing is changed two to three times per week.[3] The dressings
      used for the technique include open-cell foam dressings and gauze,
      sealed with an occlusive dressing intended to contain the vacuum
      at the wound site.[1] Where NPWT devices allow delivery of fluids,
      such as saline or antibiotics to irrigate the wound,[9][10]
      intermittent removal of used fluid supports the cleaning and
      drainage of the wound bed.[11]<br>
      <br>
      In 1995, Kinetic Concepts was the first company to have a NPWT
      product cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.[12]
      Following increased use of the technique by hospitals in the US,
      the procedure was approved for reimbursement by the Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2001.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technique</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      General technique for NPWT is as follows: a dressing or filler
      material is fitted to the contours of a wound (which is covered
      with a non-adherent dressing film) and the overlying foam is then
      sealed with a transparent film. A drainage tube is connected to
      the dressing through an opening of the transparent film. A vacuum
      tube is connected through an opening in the film drape to a
      canister on the side of a vacuum pump.[13] or vacuum source,
      turning an open wound into a controlled, closed wound[2] while
      removing excess fluid from the wound bed to enhance circulation
      and remove wound fluids. This creates a moist healing environment
      and reduces edema.[5][13] The technique is usually used with
      chronic wounds or wounds that are expected to present difficulties
      while healing (such as those associated with diabetes).[3]<br>
      <br>
      Three types of filler material are used over the wound surface:
      open-cell foam, gauze and transparent film, or honeycombed
      textiles with a dimpled wound contact surface.<br>
      <br>
      Foam dressings are used to fill open cavity wounds and can be cut
      to size to fit wounds. The foam dressing is applied, filling the
      wound and then a film drape is applied over the top to create a
      seal around the dressing.<br>
      <br>
      Open weave cotton gauze can be covered with a transparent film,
      and a flat drain is sandwiched in gauze and placed onto the wound.
      The film drape covers the wound and create a complete seal, and
      then the drain is connected to the pump via the tubing.[14]<br>
      <br>
      Layers of non-woven polyester, joined by a silicone elastomer, has
      a non-adherent wound contact surface made up of numerous small
      semi-rigid dome structures,[15] though this solution has not
      completed a clinical trial as of December 2012.[16]<br>
      <br>
      With all three techniques, once the dressing is sealed the vacuum
      pump can be set to deliver continuous or intermittent pressures,
      with levels of pressure depending on the device used,[13][14][17]
      varying between −125 and −75 mmHg depending on the material used
      and patient tolerance.[15][18] Pressure can be applied constantly
      or intermittently.[13]<br>
      <br>
      The dressing type used depends on the type of wound, clinical
      objectives and patient. For pain sensitive patients with shallow
      or irregular wounds, wounds with undermining or explored tracts or
      tunnels, gauze may be used, while foam may be cut easily to fit a
      patient’s wound that has a regular contour and perform better when
      aggressive granulation formation and wound contraction is the
      desired goal.[19]<br>
      Effectiveness<br>
      <br>
      A 2007 Cochrane Review stated that the evidence comparing NPWT to
      alternative care was flawed and required more study, but the
      evidence did support improved healing and called for more, better
      quality research to be conducted.[8] A 2010 systematic review
      found "consistent evidence of the benefit of NPWT" in the
      treatment of diabetic ulcers of the feet. Results for bedsores was
      "conflicting" and research on "mixed wounds" was of poor quality,
      but promising. The review did not find evidence of increased
      significant complications. The review concluded "There is now
      sufficient evidence to show that NPWT is safe, and will accelerate
      healing, to justify its use in the treatment of
      diabetes-associated chronic leg wounds. There is also evidence,
      though of poor quality, to suggest that healing of other wounds
      may also be accelerated."[6]<br>

      NEGATIVE Pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used to treat acute and
      chronic wounds. A vacuum source creates continuous or intermittent
      negative pressure inside the wound to remove fluid, exudates, and
      infectious materials to prepare the wound for healing and closure.<sup>1
      </sup>NPWT systems consist of a vacuum pump, drainage tubing, a
      foam or gauze wound dressing, and an adhesive film dressing that
      covers and seals the wound.
      <p>Since 1997, when the first device indicated for NPWT was
        cleared by the FDA for marketing in the United States, the
        system has evolved considerably. New device and dressing
        features have been added that make the system safer, more
        efficient, and more user-friendly in care settings other than
        hospitals, such as in long-term care facilities, rehab centers,
        and even patients’ homes.</p>
      <p>Although many patients have benefited from NPWT, adverse events
        – including deaths and serious injuries – have been reported to
        the FDA. The following is a case example:</p>
      <p>An older adult underwent bilateral femoral endarterectomy for
        severe peripheral arterial disease. About 1 week after the
        procedure, the patient required surgery for wound exploration
        and evacuation of blood clots and then was diagnosed with an
        infection of the right groin incision. An NPWT system was
        applied to the wound and the patient was discharged home on
        antibiotic and coagulation therapy.</p>
      <p>Ten days later, the patient experienced a massive hemorrhage
        from the right groin wound. When paramedics arrived at the home,
        they provided basic life and advanced cardiovascular life
        support. After transport to the ED, the patient was pronounced
        dead. The cause of death was exsanguination.</p>
      <p><b>What went wrong?</b></p>
      <p>The most serious adverse events associated with NPWT, blood
        loss and infection, can be prevented if healthcare professionals
        pay close attention to:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Device labeling, including warnings, instructions for use,
        indications, and contraindications.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Criteria for patient selection, wound type, and appropriate
        care setting based on each patient’s needs.</p>
      <p><b>What precautions can you take?</b></p>
      <p>These strategies are recommended to prevent complications:</p>
      <p><b><i>Patient selection and wound type.</i></b></p>
      <p>Patients should be thoroughly evaluated for bleeding risk. The
        patient in the case example had several risk factors for
        bleeding, including history of postoperative blood clots in the
        wound, anticoagulation therapy, and wound infection. Besides
        being at high risk for infection, groin wounds are also prone to
        delayed wound closure due to hip joint movement.</p>
      <p><b><i>High-risk patients and selection of care setting.</i></b></p>
      <p>NPWT should be used in an appropriate healthcare setting based
        on the patient’s need for monitoring and wound care. At high
        risk for bleeding and infection, this patient should have been
        in a healthcare facility where healthcare professionals are
        available around the clock.</p>
      <p><b><i>Wound care-specific considerations.</i></b></p>
      <p>Many reported adverse events are the result of inappropriate
        methods of dressing change. For instance, bleeding can occur
        from improper removal of dressings that have adhered to or are
        imbedded in the tissues. Bleeding can also occur if the dressing
        is applied directly to exposed or superficial vessels in or
        around the wound that haven’t been completely covered and
        protected as recommended by the device manufacturer before
        initiating NPWT.</p>
      <p>Wound infections may develop if pieces of dressing are retained
        in the wound. To prevent this complication, device instructions
        recommend counting the total number of dressing pieces used in
        the wound and documenting that number on the outer adhesive film
        dressing and in the patient’s medical record. Teach the
        caregiver to count the number of dressing pieces removed to make
        sure that all pieces are accounted for.</p>
      <p><b><i>Training of healthcare providers, patients, and
            caregivers.</i></b></p>
      <p>Healthcare providers using NPWT devices should undergo
        appropriate training on device use, including its indications
        and contraindications, and recognition and management of
        potential complications.</p>
      <p>NPWT training for patients and their caregivers who will be
        using the device at home should include how to:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Safely operate the device; provide a copy of printed
        instructions for patient use from the specific device
        manufacturer<br>
      </p>
      <p>Respond to audio and visual alarms<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perform dressing changes<br>
      </p>
      <p>Recognize signs and symptoms of complications, such as redness,
        warmth, and pain associated with possible infection<br>
      </p>
      <p>Contact appropriate healthcare providers, especially in
        emergency situations<br>
      </p>
      <p>Respond to emergency situations; for instance, if bright red
        blood is seen in the tubing or canister, to immediately stop
        NPWT, apply direct manual pressure to the dressing, and activate
        emergency medical services.</p>
      <p>Use return demonstrations to evaluate patients’ and caregivers’
        skills and comprehension of training materials.</p>
      <p>On November 13, 2009, the FDA published a preliminary public
        health notification on the use of NPWT systems. It will be
        updated according to findings of an ongoing investigation.

      <div align="center"><b>The clinical effectiveness of negative
          pressure wound therapy: a systematic review</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>X. Xie, M. McGregor, N. Dendukuri</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Objective: To estimate the efficacy of negative pressure wound
      therapy (NPWT), on the basis of a systematic review of reported
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs).<br>
      <br>
      Method: A systematic literature search for relevant RCTs was
      carried out. The credibility of the outcome of each study was
      evaluated using a specially constructed instrument.<br>
      <br>
      Results: We identified 17 RCTs, of which five had not been
      included in previous reviews or health technology assessments. For
      diabetic foot ulcers (seven RCTs), there was consistent evidence
      of the benefit of NPWT compared with control treatments. For
      pressure ulcers (three RCTs), results were conflicting. In trials
      involving mixed wounds (five RCTs), evidence was encouraging but
      of inadequate quality. Significant complications were not
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion: There is now sufficient evidence to show that NPWT is
      safe, and will accelerate healing, to justify its use in the
      treatment of diabetes-associated chronic leg wounds. There is also
      evidence, though of poor quality, to suggest that healing of other
      wounds may also be accelerated. <br>
