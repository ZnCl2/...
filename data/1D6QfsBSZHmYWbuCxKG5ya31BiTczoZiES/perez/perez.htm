      Researchers have developed protective guardrails from residue of
      Posidonia oceanica,commonly known as Neptune Grass or
      Mediterranean tapeweed, in order to minimize the risk of injuries
      on the roads. The waste material is useful for coating the support
      posts of guard rails on roads so they can absorb and dissipate
      much of the kinetic energy if a collision occurs, preventing
      lacerations and amputations in cases in which a human body hits
      the support post.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the University of Alicante developed protective
      guardrails from residue of Posidonia oceanica, commonly known as
      Neptune Grass or Mediterranean tapeweed, in order to minimize the
      risk of injuries on the roads.<br>
      <br>
      The technology, patented by the research group Tecnología de
      Materiales y Territorio, is useful for coating the support posts
      of guard rails on roads so they can absorb and dissipate much of
      the kinetic energy if a collision occurs, preventing lacerations
      and amputations in cases in which a human body hits the support
      post.<br>
      <br>
      An RUVID release reports that the device consists of an
      impact-absorbing coating made from a mixture of Posidonia oceanica
      residue with organic or inorganic hydraulic binders.<br>
      <br>
      This mixture, explains Professor José Miguel Saval Perez, who
      headed the research, “is done by kneading the previously dry waste
      components and binder, later adding water and prolonging their
      kneading. After the mixing, the material is introduced into a mold
      which produces compaction. Then we immediately proceed to the
      demolding of the part, allowing it to cure at room temperature. ”<br>
      <br>
      “We also provide for the use of additives such as commercial dyes
      compatible with the binder used, so that the color can be varied
      depending on the absorber signaling needs and the environment
      through which the communication path passes” adds José Miguel
      Saval.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have been conducted for the impact energy absorption of
      4,116 joules, that is, the absorption of the impact of a body
      weighing 75 kg, which smashes into the bracket at an approximate
      speed of 38 km/hour. Additional tests were performed under load
      deformation, with results suggesting that the material absorbs
      about 40 percent of the load transmitted.<br>
      <br>
      The option of using Posidonia oceanica residue feedstock for the
      shock absorber provides an alternative use of such waste, while
      avoiding raising the economic and environmental costs of
      manufacturing safer guardrails and barriers.<br>

      <b>[0002] Impact Absorber waste from Posidonia Oceanica.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> [0003] Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] The present invention is in the field of security and
      refers to an item made from mixtures of Oceanic Posidonia residues
      and organic or inorganic binders, which allows the human body
      protection against the impact in an accident.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] STATE OF THE PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Due to the swell, the Posidonia arribazones are deposited
      regularly on beaches.<br>
      <br>
      The losses from the leaves of these plants are due to the same
      causes of deciduous forests emerge from his.<br>
      <br>
      These contributions are treated almost exclusively as organic
      waste is transported to dumps quot; legalizadosquot, at best,
      resulting in significant economic and environmental costs.<br>
      <br>
      Special mention deserves the difficulty posed by these waste
      compaction and sealing deposited in landfills due to the
      cushioning effect they produce.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] On the other hand, the European Commission for
      Standardization (CEN) has recently updated the guidelines and
      specifications of containment systems in road vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      This legislation remains open to technical innovations that could
      be developed in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Among other things, points out the rules to the effect that, where
      possible, be recommended replacement or repositioning of type
      profiles quot; Cquot, in brackets safety fences barriers.<br>
      <br>
      It is true that vehicle restraint systems work very well in terms
      of protection of the vehicle before an accident, given his
      behavior as energy sink, redirect enabler, possibility of being
      stamped, great deformity, etc..<br>
      <br>
      However, all these properties have no effect when the impacting
      object is the human body, resulting in the same endless traumatic
      injuries, amputations, if not instant death.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The various known impact absorption systems use a base
      material coated supports safety fences.<br>
      <br>
      For example, PVC elements are used to envelop the metal profile.
      In this way, it is true that protect the cut, however the sink and
      absorption effect is practically nil. To overcome this drawback we
      proceed to filled with sand.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, other known coating systems based metal support shaped
      elements made of expanded polyethylene, in which the damping
      effect is better than PVC coating but with high economic impact.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The option of using posidonia residue feedstock for the
      shock absorber provides an alternative use of said waste, while
      avoiding raising the economic and environmental costs of
      manufacturing safety fences barriers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0010] SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] It is necessary in light of the above, looking for a<br>

      [0012] item that is designed to absorb and dissipate achieve much
      of<br>
      <br>

      stand, and his<br>

      <br>
      [0016] The invention is a shock absorber element manufactured<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0040] DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] Given the large number of existing brackets on the roads
      and the cost involved in the disassembly of the beam or signage to
      introduce the absorber element, around the metal profile is
      adopted as shown in Figures 1 and 2, which coating allows all
      areas of possible impact of the body against the support without
      disconnecting.<br>
      <br>
      The absorber 3 is placed covering the substrate 2, below the
      barrier bionda 1.<br>
      <br>
      Such an arrangement involves placing an anchoring element ensuring
      fastening of the absorber with the carrier. This anchor consists
      of a thin sheet of PVC which is fixed by screw connection to the
      absorber.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The absorber is made by mixing residue Posidonia Oceanica
      with organic or inorganic hydraulic binder. The mixture is made by
      kneading previously dry components (residue and binder) for 30
      seconds and subsequently adding water and mixing to prolong a time
      of two minutes. All, to obtain a mixture volume quantity of 500
      liters.<br>
      The mixture obtained is filled a mold with the desired shape of
      the absorber and allowed to cure at room temperature for 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Independent of the object of the invention the various
      hydraulic inorganic or organic binders used in their manufacture,
      preferably by arranging for reasons of durability, economy and
      availability, hydraulic inorganic binders, which correspond to the
      following mixing ratio by weight:<br>
      <br>
      [0044] binder: Posidonia: Water -7 1: 1: 2<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Also, be independent of the subject invention, the shapes
      and dimensions of the absorber, as well as all the details that
      may arise, as long as it does not affect its essence.<br>
      <br>
      However, we propose the following dimensions:<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Outer diameter: 25 cm<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Wall thickness: 8 cm<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Height: as metal support<br>
      <br>
      [0049] With these dimensions, there have been trials of impact
      energy absorption of 4116 joules, ie absorb the impact of a body
      whose weight was 75 kg, which golpease against the support at an
      approximate speed of 38 Km / hour. Moreover, trials have been
      conducted under load deformation which shows that the material
      absorbs about 40% of the load transmitted.<br>
