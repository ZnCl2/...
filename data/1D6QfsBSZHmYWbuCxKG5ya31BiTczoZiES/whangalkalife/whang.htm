          MBC, a South Korean TV network, launched several scientific
          investigations on the effects of alkaline water on chicks and
          mice. Their research is shown on the Internet Website
          “youtube,” and search for “Alkalark”. The narration is in
          Korean with English subtitles. Below is a summary of the
          video.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The MBC investigation team prepared an unusual experiment
          using 40,000 chicks. The team separated the chicks in two
          groups, 20,000 each and put them in two separate farm
          buildings, A and B.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          These chicks were raised for one month and given the same
          amount of feed, but the drinking water supplied was different.
          The group in building A was supplied with normal ground water,
          the group in building B was supplied with alkaline water made
          by minerals added to the water, including magnesium. Alkaline
          water is known to have reducing power to get rid of excess
          acidic wastes created by human metabolism.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Though a cold wave of bird flu hit the country, the chicks
          here seemed to all be healthy and full of energy.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The team wanted to know what the difference between the two
          groups was as the result of drinking ordinary water and
          alkaline water.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          First, they inspected the survival rate:<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Building A (ground water): 18,900 survived in 30 days: (94.5%
          survival rate.)<br>
          Building B (alkaline water): 19,860 survived in 30 days:
          (99.3% survival rate.)<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The mortality rate of chickens drinking alkaline water is
          about 1/8 of the ones drinking ordinary ground water.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Next, the team randomly selected 100 chickens from each group
          and measured the average weight.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Alkaline water group: 1720g, ground water group: 1590g.<br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          For the next experiment, the MBC team used OlletTF mice which
          develop diabetes due to genetic obesity. 16 mice were divided
          into two groups; again, one with general water and the other
          with alkaline water, but with the same feed. At the beginning,
          the mean blood-sugar levels of these mice were 69 and 53.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          For the next two months the team collected blood samples;
          levels of blood sugar, neutral fat, and cholesterol were
          checked regularly. As these mice raise blood-sugar
          genetically, the key point of this experiment is how much
          alkaline water influences the increase of blood sugar level.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It was confirmed that alkaline water has the effect of
          restraining about 34% of blood-sugar level compared with
          general water.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>

          This experiment proves that alkaline water has an effect not
          only on restraining blood-sugar value, but also on various
          kinds of adult disease such as hardening of the arteries, etc.
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The experiment of alkaline water’s anti-cancer effect<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          After injecting melanoma as a malignant skin cancer cell
          strain into the abdominal cavity of the experimental mice, the
          team observed the tumor size and the speed of spread. There
          were two groups of mice; one was made to drink alkaline water
          and the other the general water. The same feed was
          distributed.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          After 15 days:<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Compared with the tumor size of 10.78mm on the mice drinking
          alkaline water, the tumor on the mice drinking general water,
          were doubled in size to 20.11mm.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The team cut the tumors and measured the weight:<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It was 2.3 g for the mice drinking alkaline water, and 4.8 g
          for the mice drinking general water.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The team injected skin cancer cells into the tails and
          observed cancer spreading to the lungs, and they noticed a big
          difference in the number of colonies between the 2 groups.
          What appears as black dots on the white lungs are cancer cell
          colonies. The number of cancer cell colonies in the mice
          drinking general water was 260, while that of the mice
          drinking alkaline water was 145. This shows that alkaline
          water has an anti-cancer effect of restraining tumor spread.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          These experiments, published by the MBC network, Korea, are
          very informative. It clearly indicates that alkaline water
          helps restore and maintain good health in animals. It is
          unfortunate that the examining team did not publish the pH
          values of the general water and alkaline water used. If the pH
          of the alkaline water was much higher, the end results could
          have been much more significant.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alkaline water and stomach
            acid</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          We all know that we get old and sick because of excess acid
          accumulation in our body, and that alkaline neutralizes acid;
          therefore, drinking alkaline water makes sense.&nbsp; But do
          we know how alkaline water works in our body'&nbsp; Some
          doctors say that our stomach acid will kill the alkalinity
          and, therefore, drinking alkaline water is useless.&nbsp; How
          do we answer that'&nbsp; Have you thought about that'<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is what happens in the
            stomach.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The stomach maintains its pH around 4.0.&nbsp; When we drink
          high pH alkaline water, the water pH comes down; but stomach
          pH goes up as a result.&nbsp; How high it goes up is a
          function of the amount and the pH of the alkaline water we
          drink.&nbsp; When the stomach pH rises above 4.5, the stomach
          will produce more hydrochloric acid and put it in the stomach
          to bring the stomach pH down to below 4.0.<br>
          <br>
          How the stomach produces hydrochloric acid is not well known
          to medical doctors, except pathologists.&nbsp; The chemical
          formula of hydrochloric acid production is:<br>
          <br>
          H2O + CO2 + NaCl = HCl + NaHCO3<br>
          <br>
          Water, carbon dioxide and sodium chloride (table salt) produce
          hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate.&nbsp; The
          hydrochloric acid goes into the stomach, and the sodium
          bicarbonate goes into the bloodstream.<br>
          <br>
          [Note: An interesting fact is that the formula above looks
          simple, but no scientist in a laboratory can produce
          hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate from water and carbon
          dioxide and salt.&nbsp; Only living cells can do that.&nbsp;
          In the lab, the reverse is easy: adding hydrochloric acid to
          sodium bicarbonate will instantly produce water, carbon
          dioxide and salt.]<br>
          <br>
          Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline buffer in our blood.&nbsp;
          In our blood, there are alkaline buffer and acid buffer
          constantly monitoring the blood pH to maintain a constant
          blood pH of 7.365.&nbsp; When the blood becomes too alkaline,
          the acid buffer works to bring the pH down; and when the blood
          becomes too acid, the alkaline buffer works to raise the pH. <br>
          <br>
          Alkaline buffers are bicarbonate (HCO3-) mated with alkaline
          minerals.&nbsp; Examples of them are sodium bicarbonate
          (NaHCO3), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), calcium bicarbonate
          (Ca(HCO3)2) and magnesium bicarbonate (Mg(HCO3)2).&nbsp; Acid
          buffer is mainly carbonic acid (H2CO3), a water and carbon
          dioxide combination.&nbsp; Carbohydrate completely burnt
          becomes carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O); therefore there
          is no shortage of acid buffer.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCOVERY BY DR. LYNDA
            FRASSETTO</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In 1996 Dr. Lynda Frassetto at the University of California,
          San Francisco, discovered that as we age, starting around age
          45, we lose the alkaline buffer ' bicarbonates - in our
          blood.&nbsp; By the age of 90, we lose 18% of bicarbonates in
          our blood.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Insufficient amount of bicarbonates in our blood reduces our
          capabilities to manage (neutralize and dump) the acid our body
          produces.&nbsp; This is the cause of aging.&nbsp; The age of
          45 is the average age when human beings start to show symptoms
          of diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and many other adult
          degenerative diseases.&nbsp; And since we cannot manage the
          acid, we accumulate acidic wastes in our body.&nbsp; These
          wastes show up as cholesterol, fatty acid, uric acid, urate,
          sulfate, phosphate, kidney stones, etc.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
            PROPERTIY OF ALKALINE WATER'</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
          <br>
          There are many properties in alkaline water, such as surface
          tension, structure of water, molecular size, oxygen reduction
          potential, pH value, which alkaline minerals are used to
          sustain the pH value, etc.&nbsp; However, with the exception
          of the water's pH value, nothing else helps the blood receive
          bicarbonates.&nbsp; Also, all the other properties change as
          the water reaches the stomach and interacts with the stomach
          acid.&nbsp; Even the pH value changes in the stomach.&nbsp;
          However, the change of pH value causes the stomach to produce
          hydrochloric acid that goes into the stomach, and the
          bicarbonates go into the bloodstream.&nbsp; The most important
          function of alkaline water is to increase bicarbonates in the
          blood because we lose bicarbonates as we age. <br>
          <br>
          When we say that we alkalize our body, we don't necessarily
          mean increasing our saliva pH or urine pH; it means increasing
          the bicarbonates in our blood.&nbsp; The blood pH does not
          change, but the ability of our blood to neutralize acid in the
          body increases.<br>
          <br>
          In the January/February 2003 issue of American Industrial
          Hygiene Association Journal, Dr. Gospodinka R. Pradova
          published the result of a 10-year study of industrial
          pollution in Bulgaria.&nbsp; The study compares two groups of
          people in a plastic manufacturing plant: one group working in
          the plant with chemical pollution, the other in the
          non-polluted office environment of the same company.&nbsp; The
          conclusion shows that people living/working in a polluted
          environment have less amount of bicarbonates in their blood
          than people working in a clean environment.<br>
          <br>
          We live in a world that was changed from an agricultural
          environment to an industrial environment, which produces more
          pollution.&nbsp; Our stressful life-styles create more acid,
          which causes us to use up more bicarbonates.&nbsp; Some foods
          are more acidic than others, especially, high protein meat
          products and highly acidic soft drinks. These are the reasons
          why we lose bicarbonates in the blood as we age.<br>
          <br>
          The medical society considers the reduction of bicarbonates in
          the blood as an inevitable fact of aging.&nbsp; I argue that
          the reduction of bicarbonates in the blood is the cause of
          aging and diseases, not the result of aging.&nbsp; As long as
          we can replenish bicarbonates in the blood, we don't have to
          age!<br>
          <br>
          This is the good news about alkaline water!<br>
          <br>
          WHEN TO DRINK ALKALINE WATER<br>
          <br>
          Since bicarbonates enter the bloodstream only when the stomach
          produces hydrochloric acid, it is important that we drink as
          high a pH value alkaline water as possible.&nbsp; I recommend
          we drink alkaline water on an empty stomach.&nbsp; On an empty
          stomach, the stomach pH value may be high but the amount
          (volume) of hydrochloric acid in the stomach is small;
          therefore, drinking high pH (9.5 to 10) alkaline water will
          raise the stomach pH relatively high.&nbsp; That may cause the
          stomach to produce more hydrochloric acid, allowing more
          bicarbonates to enter the bloodstream.<br>
          <br>
          Another possibility is that alkaline water may pass into the
          intestine immediately, since there is no solid food in the
          stomach to be digested.&nbsp; When that happens, the blood
          will absorb alkaline water into the bloodstream from the
          intestine.&nbsp; If alkaline water is introduced directly into
          the bloodstream from the intestine, the acid buffer (carbonic
          acid, H2CO3) will interact with the alkaline water to bring
          down the blood pH and the acid buffer will become the alkaline
          buffer.<br>
          <br>
          Ca(OH) 2 + 2(H2CO3) = Ca++(HCO3-)2 + 2(H2O)<br>
          <br>
          An increase of bicarbonates in the bloodstream will prevent
          aging and the onset of adult degenerative diseases.&nbsp; Now
          you know the scientific mechanics of how alkaline water
          extends life. <br>
          <br>
          The above example is based on calcium hydroxide-rich alkaline
          water.&nbsp; This kind of water is produced with a water
          ionizer because the alkaline mineral in tap water is
          predominantly calcium.<br>
          <br>
          Alkaline water made with AlkaLife® contains potassium
          hydroxide and sodium hydroxide in a patented ratio.&nbsp; When
          potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide goes into the
          bloodstream, again the acid buffer, carbonic acid (H2CO3)
          reacts with them and they become bicarbonates and water.<br>
          <br>
          KOH + H2CO3 = KHCO3 + H2O<br>
          <br>
          NaOH + H2CO3 = NaHCO3 + H2O<br>
          <br>
          ONLY ALKALINE WATER!<br>
          <br>
          Various kinds of commercially produced water claim health
          benefits: energy water, Pi water, snow melted water, special
          spring water, magnetically-treated water, oxygenated water,
          hexagon structured water, etc.&nbsp; However, none of them
          adds bicarbonates to the blood except high pH alkaline
          water.&nbsp; When we think of health, we think of diet and
          exercise.&nbsp; But no diet or exercise adds bicarbonates to
          the bloodstream.<br>
          <br>
          Some people argue that we can ingest bicarbonates (baking
          soda).&nbsp; It will be like ingesting salt because our
          stomach acid will break that down into water, carbon dioxide
          and sodium salt; no bicarbonates will reach the
          bloodstream.&nbsp; And we all know what salt can do to the
          human body.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to an alkali buffer+minerals
      supplement additive to achieve alkaline drinking water and deliver
      essential minerals to the body-a blend of active ingredients
      consisting of: potassium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide with
      magnesium carbonate hydroxide with zinc, added to USP water; a
      mixture for a alkali buffer+minerals supplement for healthy blood
      pH support, with essential minerals, bottled in a non-reactive
      bottle, delivered to the human body and animal body, to support an
      alkaline healthy blood range.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The field of the present invention relates broadly to
      methods and solutions pertaining to health; "diet, evolution,
      aging and endogenous acid production. The pathophysiologic effects
      of the post-agricultural inversion of the potassium-to-sodium and
      base-to-chloride ratios in the human diet". More specifically, the
      invention pertains to a source of a alkali buffer and minerals
      supplement additive for drinking water with essential minerals
      that is prepared and bottled in a non-reactive, easy to use,
      convenient, readily dispensable concentrated additive solution
      that is added to normal drinking water (8 to 10 oz glass) or to
      any consumable, non-carbonated drink;<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Still more particularly, the invention relates to an
      additive of a concentrated alkali buffer and minerals supplement
      additive of a solution formed by the mixing of potassium hydroxide
      (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), magnesium carbonate hydroxide
      (MgCO3)4. Mg(OH)2.5H2 O and zinc (Zn) in amounts selected within a
      specific range. The additive solution is added to ordinary
      drinking water in order to increase the pill of the drinking water
      to a range of about 9.5 to 10.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Critical blood pH balancing in the alkaline range is
      indispensable when bicarbonate production is diminished or
      "endogenous acid production" (EAP)&lt;1 &gt; is overwhelming and
      the body uses essential minerals from other sites where minerals
      consumption is normally consumed, yet sacrificed to compensate for
      pH swings caused by EAP or other factors. These swings could be
      represented hours or days or in mille second i.e. sudden cardiac
      death. Thus, relatively small alterations in plasma K
      concentrations can have major clinical manifestations. Since most
      intracellular K is found in muscle cells, potassium is found
      mostly in muscle tissue. Cardiac effects of hypokalemia are
      usually minimal until plasma K levels are &lt;3 mEq/L. Hypokalemia
      may produce premature ventricular and atrial contractions,
      ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmia's, and second or third
      degree atrioventricular block. The diagnosis of hypokalemia is
      made on the basis of plasma or serum K level &lt;3.5 mEq/L.
      Occasionally renal tubular dysfunction or vigorous diuretic
      therapy may necessitate potassium supplementation. What is sudden
      cardiac death (SCD)? Sudden cardiac death (SCD), or cardiac
      arrest, is the sudden, abrupt loss of heart function in a person
      who may or may not have diagnosed heart disease. Sudden cardiac
      death is a major health problem, causing about 330,000 deaths each
      year among U.S. adults either before reaching a hospital
      oreemergency room. Heart medications. Under certain conditions,
      various heart medications can set the stage for arrhythmias that
      cause sudden cardiac death. In particular, so-called
      "antiarrhythmic" drugs, even at normally prescribed doses,
      sometimes may produce lethal ventricular arrhythmias
      ("proarrhythmic" effect). Regardless of whether there's organic
      heart disease, significant changes in blood levels, body levels of
      potassium and magnesium (from using diuretics, for example) also
      can cause life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Magnesium (Mg) is the 4th most plentiful cation in the
      human body. The maintenance of plasma Mg concentration is largely
      a function of dietary intake and extremely effective renal and
      intestinal conservation. About 50% is sequestered in bone and is
      not readily exchangeable with other compartments&lt;4&gt; . As
      with Ca, protein binding of Mg is pH dependent. A wide variety of
      enzymes are Mg activated or dependent. Mg is required by all
      enzymatic processes involving ATP and is also required by many of
      the enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Mg is required
      for thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor activity and appears to
      stabilize the structure of macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. Mg
      is also related to Ca and K metabolism in an intimate but poorly
      understood way. Soluble in about 3300 parts CO2-free water; more
      soluble in water containing CO2; soluble in diluted acids with
      effervescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The added minerals zinc (Zn) present in the invention is an
      essential bioelement&lt;7&gt; , and a cofactor in many proteins.
      Zinc (Zn) is found mainly in bones, teeth, hair, skin, liver,
      muscle, leukocytes, and testes. Dietary intake of zinc by healthy
      adults varies from 6 to 15 mg/day, and absorption is about 20%.
      The signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency include anorexia, growth
      retardation, delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, immune
      disorders, dermatitis, night blindness, impaired taste and
      impaired wound healing and others.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] It is known that sodium is in every food and food product
      that is consumed by humans and others. That is and has been a
      reality for more than 300 hundred years and looking
      retrospectively it could be said that it is true for thousands of
      years. The average amount of sodium and potassium minerals in a
      69.7 Kg (154 lb. adult man) is 63 grams and 150 grams,
      respectively. Since the atomic weights of sodium and potassium are
      23 and 39 respectively, the ratio of the number of atoms to the
      average normal body amounts of these minerals, is 63/23 for sodium
      and 150/39 for potassium. These ratios translate into 41.6% sodium
      atoms to 58.4% potassium atoms. However, in today's average diet,
      unless one is conscientiously avoiding sodium, there are more
      floods that contain sodium than potassium. Diet, evolution and
      aging-the pathophysiologic effects of the post-agricultural
      inversion of the potassium-to sodium and base-to-chloride ratios
      in the human diet.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] There is a device in a closely related field, an
      electrically powered water ionizer machine. Originally developed
      over sixty years ago in Japan, water ionizers have been
      successfully introduced in the United States within the last two
      decades or so. The chief purpose of these ionizer machines is to
      prepare alkaline drinking water from regular bottled or tap water.
      Accordingly, a ready demand for alkaline drinking water,
      recognized as being beneficial for some individuals, has developed
      in the health field.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Water ionizer machines do not add any minerals to, for
      example, regular tap water that is put into the machine. Instead,
      the ionizer has positive and negative electrodes that split the
      alkaline minerals in the tap water to one side for use and the
      water's acidic minerals to another side for discard. The pH in the
      final drinking water output from the machine, depending upon the
      minerals content of the water supplied to it, is an alkaline
      drinking water of increased oxygen that has a pH in the range of
      about 8.5 to about 10.5. Ionized water from such machines is
      essentially acid free because the ionization process removes the
      acid minerals from the machine's drinking water output. The acid
      water from such machines is discarded or finds use by florists for
      preserving cut flower shelf life. If the original water supplied
      to the ionizer is lacking alkaline minerals, the pH of the
      alkaline water produced may not reach the desired range.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Such water ionizers, although commercially successful, do
      suffer from several limitations. For example, these ionizer
      machines are expensive, ranging in price from about $600.00 to
      $2,000.00 each. In addition, such machines are relatively bulky,
      and thus are inconvenient for use by travelers. In addition, the
      convenience is somewhat in question since it does require a ready
      source of water, electricity and a discharge point for the acidic
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In spite of their shortcomings, however, the aforementioned
      machines have clearly established a recognized demand for alkaline
      water. An increasing segment of the consuming public is now
      beginning to rely on a readily available supply of
      ionizer-produced alkaline water. What was not solved by such
      machines, however, was a simple, effective power-free way to
      convert ordinary tap or bottled water into alkaline water that is
      experiencing an increased consumer demand.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] This invention overcomes the uninviting characteristics of
      the ionizer machines, and provides a simple, ready-to-use,
      concentrated additive that is easily added to bottled or tap water
      in order to convert regular potable water into a alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement for water to have a pH in the range of about
      9.5 to 10.5 where ever you are. In use, four drops of the highly
      concentrated alkali buffer and minerals supplement solution of
      this invention, is added to a glass or container of regular
      drinking water, 8 to 10 oz. in order to change the water into
      alkaline water with a minerals supplements for consumable water of
      the desired pH range of 9 to 10.5.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0013] This invention provides a highly concentrated alkali buffer
      and minerals supplement solution that is formed by blending
      potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), magnesium
      carbonate hydroxide (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H3O with zinc (Zn) to
      enhance bio-absorption. By using two or more different
      combinations of the zinc phosphates embodied in this invention,
      the pH can be further controlled in solution. More particularly,
      the invention combines one part of concentrated alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement additive solution diluted with nine parts of
      USP water packaged in one and one quarter (1.25 oz.) ounce
      non-reactive bottle. This invention, the alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement solution additive mixture is commercialized
      and sold by the assignee of this invention under the trade name of
      PHX(TM) Alkali Buffer+or et al.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The additive of this invention is further characterized by
      a diluted mixture of about one part additive to nine parts USP
      water wherein the active ingredients are formed by combining
      potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate
      hydroxide, and zinc in a range of about 9.0% potassium hydroxide,
      0.5% sodium hydroxide, 0.3% magnesium carbonate hydroxide and 0.2%
      zinc. This range is flexible to a+or minus 10% variable of the
      absolute values specified herein to meet certain conditions of the
      consumer that require this range to be altered+90% USP water to
      about 4.8% potassium hydroxide and about 4.7% sodium hydroxide,
      0.3% magnesium carbonate hydroxide and 0.2% zinc. In one of the
      preferred embodiments, one and one quarter ounce (1.25 oz.)
      bottles of 4.8% potassium hydroxide to about 4.7% sodium
      hydroxide, 0.3% magnesium carbonate hydroxide and 0.2% zinc in the
      one to nine ratio-of USP water combined with-this range being
      flexible to a+or minus 10% variable of the absolute values
      specified herein to meet certain conditions of the consumer that
      require this range to be altered. More particularly, the invention
      combines one part of concentrated active ingredients diluted with
      nine parts of USP water packaged in one and one quarter (1.25 oz.)
      ounce non-reactive bottle.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Packaged in one and one quarter ounce, non-reactive bottle
      is supplied with a droplet cap in order to allow the user to
      conveniently measure the additive amount into an ordinary glass of
      drinking water 8 to 10 oz. The amount of USP water is simply to
      dilute the concentrated form of active ingredients into an easily
      manageable droplets form for addition to a glass of 8 to 10 oz.
      drinking water. Thus, if diluted by the ratio of one part
      concentrate to nineteen parts USP water, one must add twice as
      many drops to achieve the same pH value of an alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement for drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is an object of the present invention to provide a more
      convenient source of a alkali buffer and minerals supplement
      additive for drinking water to increase pH value.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It is another object of this invention to provide a alkali
      buffer and minerals supplement for drinking water by use of an
      additive rather than relying upon a more complicated, not always
      accessible, and expensive water ionizer machine that requires
      electricity and drainage.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is still another object of this invention to formulate a
      alkali buffer and minerals supplement for drinking water by use of
      an additive prepared from USP water in combination with selected
      amounts of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium
      carbonate hydroxide and zinc.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It is yet another object of this invention to increase yet
      lower-valued pH water with a alkali buffer and minerals supplement
      for water made by an ionizer to achieve a higher pH value by use
      of a small amount of alkali buffer and minerals supplement for
      additive to the ionizer water.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It is still a further object of this invention to provide a
      readily available, easily accessible, effective adjunct source for
      alkaline-minerals water when ionizer machine-produced alkaline
      water is not available.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is yet another object of this invention to provide a
      readily available, easily accessible, effective alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement additive for consumers of other drinks, hot,
      cold or room temperature (not carbonated) that choose to make
      their drink more alkaline, raising the pH value.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EXAMPLE
        EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] Turning now to a detailed description of the invention,
      which may be understood without reference to any drawing, one must
      first understand that many minerals are present in ordinary
      drinking water. Such tap water naturally has a pH of about 7 or 8,
      and in its natural form, is not a alkali buffer and minerals
      supplement for-although some a alkali buffer and minerals
      supplement for minerals may be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The purpose of this invention is to supply an additive
      solution to purposely turn the 10 low pH of ordinary drinking
      water into an alkali buffer and minerals supplement for drinking
      water. Moreover, the invention will yield an alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement for drinking water having a pH of about 9.5 to
      10.5. The alkali buffer and minerals supplement for water of this
      invention is not a medicine to treat or cure any disease. It does,
      however, neutralize excess body acids and helps the body dispose
      of such body acids. By so doing, the health of many people have
      improved in a natural way which is enhanced by an alkali buffer
      and minerals supplement for drinking water formulated in
      accordance with the buffer additive of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The predominant alkali buffer and minerals supplement for
      minerals found in ordinary drinking water are calcium and
      magnesium, not potassium or sodium. There is no known natural
      supply of drinking water where the predominant alkali buffer and
      minerals supplement for minerals is potassium. Therefore, the
      predominant alkali buffer and minerals supplement for minerals in
      high pH alkali buffer and minerals supplement for water, without
      employing the buffer additive of this invention, are generally
      considered to be calcium and magnesium. This invention, in
      contrast, is an alkali buffer and minerals supplement for water
      made by adding potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, magnesium
      carbonate hydroxide and zinc to regular water.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] A summary of the development of this invention is believed
      to be helpful to understanding the basis for the preferred
      embodiment of the alkali buffer and minerals supplement for buffer
      additive. Sodium hydroxide is commonly used to increase the
      alkalinity of any alkali. However, sodium (Na) alone is reportedly
      harmful to ones health and thus sodium free diets have been
      advocated. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) hydroxide
      concentrations are very murky and do not dissolve easily in water.
      For these reasons these alternatives were not deemed acceptable in
      a search for a convenient alkali buffer and minerals supplement
      for concentrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In the human body, it is important to maintain a proper
      balance of potassium and sodium. A prolonged use of potassium
      hydroxide alone may cause an imbalance of potassium and sodium.
      For this reason, a combination of potassium hydroxide and sodium
      hydroxide was tried next in the research and development program.
      A significant issue was finding the right percentage combination
      of the number of sodium and potassium atoms in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The average amount of sodium and potassium minerals in a
      154 pound adult man is 63 grams and 150 grams, respectively. Since
      the atomic weights of sodium and potassium are 23 and 39
      respectively, the ratio of the number of atoms to the average
      normal body amounts of these minerals, is 63/23 for sodium and
      150/39 for potassium. These ratios translate into 41.6% sodium
      atoms to 58.4% potassium atoms. However, in today's average diet,
      unless one is conscientiously avoiding sodium, there are more
      foods that contain sodium than potassium. Accordingly, the amount
      of sodium should be reduced somewhat.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] A one and one quarter oz. bottle of the alkali buffer and
      minerals additives of this embodiment contains about 1200 drops.
      When four drops of this embodiment buffer+minerals additive is
      added to a 10 oz. glass of regular tap water, the water pH value
      increases from approximately 7 or 8 to about 9.5 to 10.5. This pH
      change represents approximately 10 mgs of potassium hydroxide, 3.3
      mgs of sodium hydroxide, statistically reduced values of magnesium
      carbonate hydroxide and zinc per glass of water. The daily
      requirement of sodium and potassium is about 3,000 mgs and 1,000
      mgs, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The purpose of this buffer is to make a drinking water
      whose pH value is approximately 9.5 to 10.5. This is a typical pH
      value of the water produced by the water ionizer when there are
      high amounts of minerals in the tap water. Alkaline water from an
      ionizer has little or no acid minerals since the ionizer removes
      them. High pH alkali buffer and minerals supplement for water
      produced by the buffer of this invention has all the acid minerals
      that were in the originally supplied water. If the alkali buffer
      and the minerals supplement were added to the alkaline water from
      an ionizer, it will further boost the alkalinity of that water and
      the water, of course, does not have acid minerals.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In some geographical areas, tap water contains very small
      amounts of alkaline minerals. In such cases, the pH value of the
      water produced by the ionizer is low, even under 8. The alkali
      buffer and minerals supplement of this invention helps that
      condition. Thus, the buffer additive of this invention is also
      useful as a supplement for alkaline water from an ionizer machine.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] While the invention has been described with reference to a
      particular example of preferred embodiments, it is the intention
      to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
      following appended claims. It is therefore requested that the
      claims be given a liberal interpretation which is within the
      spirit and scope of the contribution to this art.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A human
      consumable chemical compound of calcium carbonate which is coated
      with an impervious coating that will not allow the compound to
      dissolve from stomach acid but does allow it to dissolve in the
      aqueous environment of the intestine. The chemical compound is
      time released, and is positionally sensitive to reach the
      intestines of the human body where it is absorbed into the blood.
      Carbonic acid in the blood reacts upon the gradual dissolution of
      the compound and this reaction converts the calcium carbonate to
      calcium bicarbonate. Calcium bicarbonate in the blood neutralizes
      the body's harmful acidic wastes and is a substitute for drinking
      about fifty ounces of alkaline drinking water daily. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The field of the present invention relates broadly to methods and
      compounds pertaining to health. More specifically, the invention
      relates to a human consumable dry chemical compound of calcium
      carbonate, say in pill form, which carbonate reacts with carbonic
      acid in our blood. The result of this reaction is a conversion
      into calcium bicarbonate, thus supplying calcium bicarbonate into
      the blood.<br>
      <br>
      Coating such a pill, tablet or the like with an enteric layer that
      sufficiently resists the effect of stomach acid, will assure the
      user that the pill compound will pass through the stomach. It then
      dissolves in the intestines for direct absorption into the
      bloodstream as calcium carbonate and changes into calcium
      bicarbonate in the bloodstream.<br>

      <br>
      Diets and exercise are strongly recommended for today's life
      style. No diet or exercise, however, can effectively replenish
      bicarbonates to the blood. It is a known fact that we lose
      bicarbonates in our blood as we age. See, the Journal of
      Gerontology: BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1996. Vol. 51A. No. 1 , B91-B99,
      Age and Systemic Acid-Base Equilibrium: Analysis of Published
      Data, by Drs. Lynda Frassetto and Anthony Sebastian of the
      University of California, San Francisco, Department of Medicine
      and General Clinical Research Center.<br>

      (Dotted line added by Sang Whang)<br>
      <br>
      The figure above is Figure 2, graph B of the above reference. From
      this figure, we can see that a noticeable decline begins at the
      age of 45, and by the age of 90, we lose 18% of the bicarbonates
      (HCO3-). Bicarbonates are the alkaline buffers that neutralize
      acid, resulting in the elimination of acidic wastes in our body.
      Decline of bicarbonates in the blood signal the beginning of
      acid-induced adult degenerative diseases. The age of 45 is the
      average age when symptoms of diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis,
      etc. start to appear. The world totally missed the fact that the
      very cause of aging is the diminishing of bicarbonates in the
      blood.<br>
      <br>
      I am the first to discover this fact and herein teach that
      replenishing bicarbonates in the blood is the way to prevent aging
      and also to prevent the age-related/acid-induced adult
      degenerative diseases. Even the author of the reference paper
      above, thinks the reduction of bicarbonates in the blood is an
      inevitable fact of life as we age. Dr. Frassetto's paper concludes
      that, as doctors treat kidney patients, they must treat old people
      differently from young people because old people have less
      bicarbonate in their blood. Bicarbonates are found in human blood
      mainly in the form of potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate
      and calcium bicarbonate. A small amount of magnesium bicarbonates
      are present as well. As we age we lose bone density (osteoporosis)
      because the lack of alkaline minerals in the blood forces the body
      to rob calcium from our bones. Therefore, ideally, calcium
      bicarbonates are the best bicarbonates to supply to the blood.<br>
      <br>
      We are told, therefore, to take calcium tablets as we age.
      However, calcium carbonate provided by calcium tablets, does not
      dissolve easily. Moreover, the calcium carbonate that does
      dissolve is destroyed by our stomach acid and becomes calcium salt
      and water and carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      CaCO3 + 2HCI = CaCI2 + H2CO 3 = CaCI2 + H2O + CO2<br>
      <br>
      Calcium bicarbonate is not available on the market. Apparently
      nobody can produce it. Perhaps the chemical compound is not stable
      enough to maintain in powder form. Indeed, it may require absolute
      zero humidity, which is very difficult to maintain. If calcium
      bicarbonates were available, the same techniques disclosed in my
      pending patent application, PCT/US04/18780 would have been
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      Under such circumstances, the question may be posed: How does one
      go about getting calcium bicarbonate into our bodies? If presented
      in pill form, the calcium carbonate in the stomach will be
      destroyed by the stomach hydrochloric acid. Thus, the calcium
      carbonate never reaches the bloodstream. Bicarbonates are
      relatively neutral and are considered by the medical community, to
      be neutral enough to be put directly into the blood stream. For
      example, at hospitals, it is known for revival purposes to inject
      sodium bicarbonate directly into the veins of patients coming to
      the emergency room in a comma caused by a low blood pH. But, that
      is different than my present invention. I don't teach injecting an
      alkaline solution to elevate the blood pH. Rather, this invention
      introduces calcium carbonate, an alkaline compound, into the
      bloodstream by enteric coating a calcium carbonate tablet and
      allowing the bodies natural processes to supply the much needed
      calcium bicarbonate to the blood.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCUSSION OF MY EARLIER PATENTS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The benefits, for example, of alkaline water are well set forth in
      my issued U.S. patent 5,306,511 ('511) and need not be repeated
      here. My United States ('13O) patent discloses and claims dry oral
      units of a potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate in a
      time-released mixture.<br>
      <br>
      It is accepted and understood that the accumulation of acid within
      and throughout the body contributes to the aging process and is a
      major cause of many adult degenerative diseases. There are many
      antacids on the market; however those are for the reduction of
      over- acidification of the stomach. These commercial antacids are
      for a different purpose and are of a different chemical compound.<br>
      <br>
      Many drugs are wasting chemicals because they are not enteric
      coated and much of the drug is being lost in the stomach. Indeed,
      only a small portion of a given drug goes into the blood; thus
      pumping an unnecessary amount of chemicals into the body, which
      drugs often cause bad side-effects. The pill of my '130 patent,
      uses what may be considered an insignificant amount of potassium
      and sodium. But, the pill, in time release form, is combined with
      an enteric coating in my pending patent application,
      PCT/US04/18780 and these minerals do much more than big doses of
      medicine which have adverse side-effects. Most of the enteric
      coatings in the past were used to protect the stomach walls from
      the damaging effects of drugs dissolving in the stomach.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly stated, alkaline drinking water of increased oxygen having
      a pH in the range of about 8.5 to about 10.5 is created from
      ordinary tap water treated in accordance with my patented '511
      invention. AlkaLife(R) of my '511 patent is an additive that
      assures a readily available source of alkaline water. Such water
      is made by simply adding a couple of drops of my patented additive
      to a 10 ounce glass of water in order to make the pH of the water
      about 10. It is recommended that five glasses of water, or about
      50 ounces, should be consumed daily. Five glasses daily of
      alkaline water via my AlkaLife(R) additive enhances health and
      well being.<br>
      <br>
      AlkaLife(R) of my '511 patent, reduces acidic waste by responding
      to the natural functioning of the human body. Thus, alkalinity of
      the water we drink is neutralized by the stomach acid, but the
      presence of my patented product raises the stomach pH higher. Our
      body, while trying to maintain the stomach pH in its original acid
      state, causes the stomach to produce more hydrochloric acid so
      that it may be injected into the stomach. In the process, our
      bodies develop bicarbonates which enter our blood and stand by as
      an alkaline buffer to destroy acidic wastes in our body, when
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      H2O + CO2 + NaCI = HCI + NaHCO3 If there is no immediate acidic
      waste, the bicarbonates wait there as a blood buffer until acidic
      wastes do appear. Removing such harmful waste is critical for our
      continued health and longevity.<br>
      <br>
      My '130 patent discloses and claims oral intake units of a
      potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate mixture which enters
      the human body in dry bicarbonate form. In my '130 patent a time
      release material is also associated with the pill, tablet, caplet
      or capsule. My research has shown, however, that added health
      benefits are achieved if the time-released compound of my '130
      patent delivers its beneficial treatment capability directly into
      the intestinal tract. Disintegration in the stomach wastes the
      bicarbonates and thus diminishes the amount of beneficial results
      one may expect.<br>
      <br>
      While my earlier patents have centered on bicarbonates of sodium
      and potassium, this present invention centers on calcium. Calcium
      bicarbonate is not available for formulation of a pill, and thus I
      have invented a calcium carbonate time release pill that is
      enteric coated to avoid damage by hydrochloric acid of the
      stomach. Once the pill has passed into the intestinal fluids, the
      pill dissolves and is absorbed into the blood stream. Carbonic
      acid in the blood converts the dissolved calcium carbonate into
      much needed calcium bicarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      There are cases where a patient cannot take any potassium, as for
      example, a patient with kidney dialysis. For them calcium
      bicarbonate is a must. As we age we lose not only bicarbonates but
      also calcium. This is a well known fact. Most people over 60
      suffer osteoporosis and they are told to take calcium pills. This
      new pill achieves two benefits with one stone: adding both
      bicarbonates and calcium to the blood. SUMMARY OF THE <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRESENT INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I claim using an alkaline mineral compound (a mineral compound
      dissolved in water that displays alkaline property) which is
      interjected directly into the bloodstream and takes advantage of
      carbonic acid (H2CO3) therein to neutralize it and thus provide
      bicarbonates to the blood. These alkaline mineral compounds must
      be enteric coated to avoid damage by the hydrochloric acid in the
      stomach. In particular, the mineral compound may takes the form of
      calcium carbonate and my process yields calcium bicarbonate as a
      reaction with carbonic acid in the blood.<br>
      <br>
      CaCO3+ H2CO3= Ca(HCOs)2 = Ca&lt;++&gt; + (HCO3- J2<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium may work in a similar manner (replace Ca with Mg in the
      above formula), but the amount of magnesium required by the human
      body, compared to calcium, is very small.<br>
      <br>
      I respectfully submit that a positional-sensitive, time released
      disintegration of my alkaline mineral compound ("pill") is a
      significant discovery for creating highly necessary calcium
      bicarbonate in our blood stream. This discovery may very well
      foretell a major change for medicine of the future. Many of
      today's bad diseases that call for expensive medicines may
      disappear naturally if my teaching of this invention is widely
      accepted.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to neutralize and reduce the
      body's acidic waste products by a readily consumable chemical in
      pill form which is enteric coated so that the pill will not
      dissolve in the stomach but rather dissolves further along in the
      digestive process.<br>
      <br>
      It is still a further object of this invention to provide, in an
      enteric coated pill form, a calcium compound that is converted
      into bicarbonate by reaction with carbonic acid naturally
      predominant in human blood.<br>
      <br>
      It is still a further object of this invention to provide a pill-
      supplied source of calcium carbonate in an orally administered
      time release calcium pill having an outer coating of enteric
      material which dissolves only in the intestines so that the
      calcium carbonate pill&lt;"&gt; combines with carbonic acid in the
      blood as calcium bicarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I report herein the results of my experiment that confirms the
      basis of my discovery. Calcium carbonate powder dissolved into
      water may raise the pH as high as 9. When carbonic acid (in the
      form of club soda) is added to the mixture, the pH instantly drops
      to neutral. This is how I obtained the confidence that I can input
      calcium carbonate directly into the blood stream without worrying
      about elevating the blood pH too high.<br>
      <br>
      Carbohydrates that we consume turn into carbonic acid.
      (Carbohydrate, completely burnt turns into carbon dioxide and
      water, thus becoming carbonic acid.) Our blood has so much
      carbonic acid that our lungs are constantly exhaling carbon
      dioxide, so as to not over acidify the blood. There is no shortage
      of carbonic acid in our blood, especially in our veins. The
      Columbia Encyclopedia states; "Calcium carbonate is largely
      insoluble in water but is quite soluble in water containing
      dissolved carbon dioxide, combining with it to form the
      bicarbonate." This invention, as explained below, takes advantage
      of this fact.<br>
      <br>
      It is generally understood that more than 70% of our body is water
      and more than 90% of blood is water. With my time release and
      enteric coating features, the pill will be prevented from
      releasing all at once. Such a sudden release might increase too
      rapidly the amount of calcium bicarbonate that is created in the
      blood. Such a rapid release might, in some sensitive persons,
      result in a sensation of alkalosis. Time release guards against
      that possibility.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Turning now to a detailed description of the invention, which may
      be understood without reference to any drawing, one must first
      briefly understand the human aging process. Aging is primarily
      marked by the accumulation of non-disposed acidic waste products
      that our cells produce as they burn nutrients to generate energy.
      We need to burn nutrients in order to function and live.<br>
      <br>
      Acid coagulates blood and the accumulated acidic wastes of our
      bodies clog our capillary vessels and reduce blood circulation
      near the accumulated waste locations. It is postulated that this
      phenomena is the primary cause of adult diseases such as diabetes,
      kidney disease, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      It is also believed important for an understanding of the
      invention, to note the effects of alkaline water in the human
      body. Drinking alkaline water neutralizes and reduces the acidic
      waste products created within our bodies. Thus, people drinking
      alkaline water have observed many health improvements over the
      years. In accordance with this invention, alkaline water benefits
      are available in readily consumable chemical pill, tablet, capsule
      or caplet form. (These various forms are collectively referred to
      herein as a "pill".) Coating my '130 pill with an enteric coating,
      allows the dissolution to be positionally controlled at the exact
      location where such dissolution is most beneficial. Such a coating
      prevents the pill from dissolving prematurely in the stomach where
      benefits to be derived from the pill constituents are wasted.
      Thus, in my invention, the pill is dissolved in the intestine
      where its time release format can work the best. It is there in
      the intestine that the most beneficial results are achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Additional inert compounds to make a pill a slow time release
      pill, or additional coating material that spreads out the pill's
      dissolution time are known in the art. In the relevant art a slow
      acting pill may be described by various terms such as extended
      release, sustained release, controlled release, delayed release,
      sustained action, continuous action and slow release. All of these
      terms mean essentially the same thing - namely, that the action of
      the pill is gradually spread out over an extended period of time.<br>
      <br>
      I desire a time release period of about 5 to 7 hours inside the
      intestine. In about two hours, the pill, tablet, capsule or caplet
      will have cleared the stomach and will have entered into the
      user's intestines before any chemical dissolution may begin to
      take place. Enteric coating resists any disintegration while in
      the presence of the stomach acid environment. In the intestinal
      tract, however, the enteric coating dissolves away, and the
      favorable time release benefits of my invention become available.<br>
      <br>
      To explain, please note that the blood in our bodies has ample
      amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide. That is where the calcium
      carbonate will be entering for reaction purposes. Even if the
      calcium carbonate was not fully dissolved, the calcium carbonate
      will become , dissolved by reacting with the carbonic acid. Such a
      reaction produces ionization for the calcium compound.<br>
      <br>
      When a chemical compound dissolves in water some part of the
      constituents split loosely and one side becomes charged as a
      positive polarity and the other side becomes charged to a negative
      polarity. For example, when a table salt NaCI dissolves in water,
      then it becomes Na+ and Cl-. In a similar manner CaCO3,
      undissolved, remains neutral; however, dissolved in the presence
      of a carbon dioxide solution, it becomes CA&lt;+&gt;* and
      (HCO3-)2.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, calcium has two positive charges and bicarbonate
      has one negative charge; therefore there must be two bicarbonates
      required in order to achieve an electrically equivalent match.
      Usually plus and minus signs are omitted by convention, but when
      we are denoting that it is dissolved in water and ionized, the +
      or - signs are shown in order to denote polarity, and also denote
      the fact that these molecules are ionized. In other words, the
      molecules are electrically active.<br>
      <br>
      Water is H2O and obviously it is dissolved. However only one H2O
      molecule in 10,000,000 is ionized to be H+ and OH- in room
      temperature. In other words, the hydrogen ion concentration is one
      in 10 to the seventh power. We call this a ph of 7. There is a
      difference between dissolved and ionized. Some chemical compounds
      dissolve well but do not get ionized easily, while some chemical
      compounds dissolve and get ionized very easily. Alkaline minerals
      get ionized easily. Usually, the order of ionization ease is
      potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. Fortunately, calcium
      bicarbonate ionizes very easily. What makes the calcium ionized?
      The answer is carbonic acid. In the absence of carbonic acid,
      calcium remains insoluble and non- ionized. Bicarbonate is very
      soluble in water and it caries a negative charge. Ionized means
      the particle is electronically charged either positive or
      negative. The ionization takes place in aqueous solution, in other
      words, in water. Without water, there is no alkalinity or acidity.<br>
      <br>
      When a particle is charged it is active. It doesn't mean a free
      radical. There is a matching opposite polarity particle nearby but
      they are loosely bound. And if there is an oppositely charged
      particle which is stronger in attraction, it mates with it.
      Calcium carbonate does not dissolve easy in water. If it does not
      dissolve, it does not react with other substances. Even if it
      dissolves, if it is not ionized, it is not actively reacting with
      other chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the calcium pill, after passing through the stomach, enters
      the "aqueous" intestinal area where it begins a time release
      dissolution. Then the capillary vessels in the intestinal walls
      suck the calcium carbonate molecules into the blood stream. As
      they enter the blood stream, the carbonic acid in the blood
      converts the calcium carbonate to calcium bicarbonate. Although we
      know that we lose calcium bicarbonates as we age, we now have an
      invention that assures a simple and secure replacement mechanism
      for those missing bicarbonates.<br>
      <br>
      CaCO3 + H2CO3 = Ca(HCO3)2 = Ca&lt;+&gt;* + 2(HCO3&lt;"&gt;)<br>

      While my invention has been described with reference to a
      particular example of preferred embodiments, it is my intention to
      cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
      following appended claims. It is therefore requested that the

      consumable chemical compound of specific selected ranges of
      potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate is provided. A
      bicarbonate mixture in tablet form is a substitute for alkaline
      drinking water. The lung's exhaling of carbon dioxide provides the
      required mechanism for activating this chemical compound to become
      alkaline. A balanced chemical supply of potassium bicarbonate and
      sodium bicarbonate provide increased blood buffers which
      neutralizes the body's harmful acidic wastes and is benefical to
      one's health. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The field of the present invention relates broadly to methods and
      compounds pertaining to health. More specifically, the invention
      relates to a human consumable chemical compound of specific
      selected ranges of potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate.
      Such a compound, in oral, time-release form supplies all the daily
      requirements as an increased bicarbonate blood buffer for
      neutralizing acidic body wastes during that particular time
      release period.<br>
      <br>
      Still more particularly, the invention pertains to a chemical
      compound that persons may take as a substitute source for alkaline
      drinking water. Such a compound, in pill form, is a convenient,
      readily consumable substitute source for healthy alkaline drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      New medical developments, devices and health aids are emerging on
      the domestic market at an ever increasing pace. The benefits, for
      example of alkaline water and related devices relevant to its
      commercialization are well set forth in my issued<br>
      U.S. patent 5,306,511 and need not be repeated here. Briefly,
      however, my patent sets forth the basis for the unquestioned
      advantages of alkaline water in general - whether such water is
      ionizer-machine-produced or additive produced.<br>
      <br>
      Alkaline drinking water of increased oxygen has a pH in the range
      of about 8.5 to about 10.5. AlkaLife of my '511 patent is a
      readily available source of alkaline water. Such water is made by
      simply adding a couple of drops of my patented additive to a 10
      ounce glass of water in order to make the pH of the water about
      10.<br>
      <br>
      An increasingly large segment of the consuming public is now
      relying on alkaline water, particularly my additive-produced
      alkaline water. Experience indicates that a person should drink
      five glasses of alkaline water a day in order to get the health
      benefits of reduced acid in the body. Body-created acids are
      neutralized by alkaline water, so that they may easily be
      discharged from the body by urine and perspiration.<br>
      <br>
      Since the body's acid waste products are produced continuously
      throughout the day, one should drink five glasses of alkaline
      water, not all at once, but more or less evenly distributed
      throughout the day. In practice, however, it is not easy to do so
      - day in, and day out. In our busy life, it seems, we even skip
      meals, never mind drinking five evenly spaced glasses of alkaline
      water throughout the day.<br>
      <br>
      Individual pills of potassium bicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate
      alone are available in the art. Doctors Anthony<br>
      Sebastian et al in the New England Journal of Medicine, June 23,
      1994, report this practice in an article entitled: "Improved
      mineral balance and skeletal metabolism in postmenopausal women
      treated with potassium bicarbonate".<br>
      <br>
      It is also known to prescribe sodium bicarbonate pills prior to
      chemotherapy. Cells that are killed by chemotherapy become acid
      waste in our bodies.<br>
      <br>
      It is also common to take vitamins that include small amounts of
      sodium, potassium and other minerals. Such vitaminsupplied
      minerals are an attempt to meet our daily needs for these required
      substances. There is no attempt to use such vitamin minerals for
      purposes of neutralizing acidic body waste, nor to act as an
      alkaline water substitute.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, there are various indigestion salts and commercial
      remedies - such as Alka Seltzer and Alka Seltzer<br>
      Effervescent Antiacid - that are available in the art. Such
      indigestion remedies primarily are designed for pre-mixture in
      water and subsequent human consumption. Products such as these
      contain sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, aspirin and to a lesser
      extent even potassium bicarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      In general, however, such indigestion mixtures do not contain
      potassium bicarbonate at all. Or, if some potassium bicarbonate is
      present, the amount is small in comparison to a predominantly
      larger percentage of sodium bicarbonate. Products of this type,
      therefore, are going in a wrong direction and teach away from the
      scope, power and novelty of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      How does one achieve the benefits of drinking alkaline water
      without suffering from a rigid water consumption schedule? That is
      the purpose of this invention. In other words, what had not been
      solved before the advent of this invention was a simple, effective
      chemical compound that achieves the benefits of alkaline water
      without the necessity of drinking five or more time-spaced glasses
      of such water per day.<br>
      <br>
      This invention creates a new compound - perhaps in a pill form -
      that one can take once a day in the morning; which compound will
      provide the same effect as drinking five glasses of alkaline water
      a day distributed throughout the day. Thus, a person relying on
      the invention is relieved of the strict, rigid time schedule
      demand of drinking spaced glasses of alkaline water. One's overall
      health benefits from use of the invention, and one is relieved
      from some of the pressures caused by today's busy and hectic
      work-a-day fast paced life.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention provides a human consumable chemical compound of
      specific selected ranges of potassium bicarbonate and sodium
      bicarbonate for the purpose of neutralizing body acid waste. More
      particularly, the invention combines such bicarbonate mixture in a
      pill form as a substitute for alkaline drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      The invented compound of this invention shall be commercialized
      and sold by the assignee of this invention under the selected
      tradename of AlkaMinTH.<br>
      <br>
      This invention is further characterized by relying on the lung's
      exhaling ability of carbon dioxide to provide the required
      mechanism for activating my novel compound. The bodies natural
      adaptation to intake, together with a balanced chemical supply of
      potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate, is employed to
      neutralize the body's harmful acidic wastes and promote an easy
      removal of such neutralized body waste.<br>
      <br>
      In using this invention, a person's blood pH remains at a safe and
      stable value and the health is improved. In time release form the
      invention provides both convenience and a natural dissolving
      process in the body. Thus, my orally consumable chemical compound
      invention readily and conveniently becomes a safe substitute for
      achieving all of the beneficial effects of alkaline water in the
      body of the user.<br>
      <br>
      Packaged chemical inventive compounds - in time release pill form
      - become a ready one-a-day substitute which achieves the same acid
      reduction capability in the body that drinking five equally
      spaced, ten ounce glasses per day of alkaline drinking water
      achieves. Beneficial health results are thus achieved by a novel
      compound mixture and method of relying on the lung's natural body
      functioning in order to activate a novel chemical formula within a
      user's body.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a convenient
      chemical source as a human consumable substitute for alkaline
      drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of my invention to prepare an alkaline
      drinking water substitute by use of safe neutral compounds of
      potassium bicarbonates and sodium bicarbonates which are made
      alkaline within the user's body by natural body functions.<br>
      <br>
      It is still another object of this invention to formulate an
      alkaline drinking water substitute from safe neutral bicarbonates
      of potassium and sodium in a mixture having specific percentage
      ranges of these ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to neutralize and
      reduce the body's acidic waste products by a readily consumable
      chemical in pill form - perhaps of the time release pill variety.<br>
      <br>
      It is still a further object of this invention to provide In a
      chemical or pill form, safe neutral compounds of KHCO3 (potassium
      bicarbonate) and NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) in order to produce
      the equivalent effects of drinking alkaline water<br>
      It is still a further object of this invention to provide a
      pillsupplied source of potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) and sodium
      bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in an orally administered time release pill.<br>
      <br>
      It is still a further object of this invention to prevent
      increased body acidity through blood buffers such as a mixture of
      weak acids and salts of strong bases.<br>
      <br>
      One additional object is to allow an orally administered blood
      buffer to keep the body's pH value from experiencing extreme
      fluctuations.<br>
      <br>
      It is still one further object of this invention to provide and
      maintain the proper ratio of potassium and sodium in the human
      body over prolonged periods of time.<br>
      <br>
      Another object is to increase sodium bicarbonate in the blood
      while also increasing the amount of potassium absorbed in the
      human body cells.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet one further object of this invention to provide a time
      release pill compound of bicarbonates selected at the ratio of
      about 75% (potassium bicarbonate) to about 25% (sodium
      bicarbonate) as the primary ingredients for an alkaline drinking
      water substitute.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EXAMPLE
        EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Turning now to a detailed description of the invention, which may
      be understood without reference to any drawing, one must first
      briefly understand the human aging process. Aging is primarily
      marked by the accumulation of non-disposed acidic waste products
      that our cells produce as they burn nutrients to generate energy.
      We need to burn nutrients in order to function and live.<br>
      <br>
      Acid coagulates blood and the accumulated acidic wastes of our
      bodies clog our capillary vessels and reduce blood circulation
      near the accumulated waste locations. It is believed that this
      phenomena is the primary cause of adult diseases such as diabetes,
      kidney disease, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      It is also believed important for an understanding of the
      invention, to note the effects of alkaline water in the human
      body.<br>
      <br>
      Drinking alkaline water neutralizes and reduces the acidic waste
      products created within our bodies. Thus, people drinking alkaline
      water have observed many health improvements over the years. In
      accordance with this invention, the alkaline water benefits are
      available in readily consumable chemical pill, tablet,caplet or
      capsule form.<br>
      <br>
      Acid substance when dissolved in water causes the water to have
      more hydrogen ions (H+) than hydroxyl ions (OH-). Alkaline water
      contains more hydroxyl ions (OH-) than hydrogen ions (H+).<br>
      <br>
      Neutralizing acid with alkaline means supplying hydroxyl ions
      (OH-) so that the excess H+ ions in acid will become H2O or water
      by combining with OH- ions.<br>
      <br>
      H+ + OH- = H20<br>
      There are approximately 1 x 1025 number of H2O water molecules in
      a 10 oz. glass of water. The pH value of 10 means that there are 1
      x 1021 number of hydroxyl ions (OH-) in that 10 oz glass of water.
      Assuming that 70% of the OH- ions are mated with potassium ions
      (K+) and 30% of the OH- ions are mated with sodium ions (Na+),
      then one may compute the respective number of<br>
      KOH molecules and NaOH molecules as 7 x 1 020 and 3 xl 020.<br>
      <br>
      From the molecular weights of these materials, it can be
      calculated that in a 10 oz glass of (pH 10) alkaline water made by<br>
      AlkaLifeR there are 65.1 mg of KOH and 19.9 mg of NaOH.<br>
      <br>
      Since KOH and NaOH are caustic, taking 65.1 mg of KOH and 1 9.9 mg
      of NaOH in a pill form is poisonous. For this reason,<br>
      AlkaLifeR of my '511 patent is already diluted in H20, and two
      drops of AlkaLifeR is added (further diluted) to a 10 oz glass of
      drinking water in order to make it an alkaline water with the pH
      value of about 1 0. In a liquid form this packaging and dilution
      process is possible.<br>
      <br>
      In a chemical or pill form, I am proposing safe neutral compounds
      of KHCO3 (potassium bicarbonate) and NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate).
      In order to produce the equivalent effect of 10 oz.<br>
      <br>
      alkaline water, there must be 11 6.2 mg of KHCO3 and 41.8 mg of
      NaHCO3. For fifty (50) ounces of alkaline water (one day's
      drinking water amount), there must be 581.2 mg of KHC03 and 209.2
      mg of NaHCO3. If these amounts of potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)
      and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are put in a time release pill
      form, taking such a pill a day in the morning will provide the
      effect of drinking five well spaced glasses of alkaline water a
      day.<br>
      <br>
      The human blood is slightly alkaline and its pH value must be
      maintained between 7.3 and 7.4. Even minor variations are
      dangerous. If the blood pH value drops to 6.95 (barley over the
      line on the acid side), coma and death results. And, if the blood
      pH value rises to 7.5 to 7.7, titanic convulsions occur. With acid
      blood, the heart relaxes and ceases to beat, and with too alkaline
      blood it contracts and ceases to beat. [Acid &amp; Alkaline by
      Herman<br>
      Aihara, George Ohsawa Macrobiotic Foundation, 1986]<br>
      In the human blood plasma, two compounds are dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      One is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (alkaline buffer) and the other
      is carbonic acid (H2CO3) (volatile acid). If we increase the
      amount of carbonic acid, as by exercise, the blood becomes more
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      As we all know, we breath out carbon dioxide CO2 constantly. That
      means the volatile acid H2CO3 in the blood loses<br>
      CO2 easily and becomes H20. Thus the blood becomes less acid or
      more alkaline. As our blood gets more acidic - or builds up more
      carbonic acid - we exhale more CO2 to maintain a stable and safe
      level alkalinity for our blood.<br>
      <br>
      Another way the body prevents increased acidity is through blood
      buffers such as sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Blood buffers are
      mixtures of weak acids and salts of strong bases. Blood buffers
      work to keep the pH value from experiencing extreme fluctuations,
      and thus resist changes in hydrogen ion concentration.<br>
      <br>
      If a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or
      lactic acid, which we may symbolize as HX, is added to the blood,
      it unites with some of the sodium of the sodium bicarbonate and
      drives off carbon dioxide, according to the following equation:
      HX+NaHC03 = NaX + H2O + CO2 = NaX + H2CO3<br>
      Addition of a strong acid, HX, to the blood results in an alkaline
      or neutral substance NaX plus carbonic acid, H2C03, which is
      volatile weak acid that can easily be transformed into water by
      lung exhalation of CO2. Another way to look at it, is that the
      lungs remove CO2 from sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, thus leaving
      sodium hydroxide, NaOH. Sodium hydroxide is strongly alkaline and
      thus sodium hydroxide, NaOH will neutralize this strong acid<br>
      H)C<br>
      NaHC03 - CO2 = NaOH NaOH + HX = NaX + H2O<br>
      Potassium bicarbonate can act as buffer also. However, in the
      human body, potassium is more in the cells while sodium is more in
      the extra cellular fluids and the blood. It is very important to
      maintain the proper ratio of potassium and sodium in the human
      body. If you want to increase sodium bicarbonate in the blood, you
      must increase the potassium in the body as well.<br>
      <br>
      Potassium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate pills are available
      already. Doctors Anthony Sebastian et al in the New<br>
      England Journal of Medicine, June 23, 1 994 report "Improved
      mineral balance and skeletal metabolism in postmenopausal women
      treated with potassium bicarbonate". I also know a doctor who
      prescribes sodium bicarbonate pills (600 mgs, 4 times a day) prior
      to chemotherapy to raise the urine pH value to 7.5, alkaline
      urine. This prescription approach is to reduce the side effects
      that could be caused by the generation of acid wastes when
      chemotherapy is administered.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors do not prescribe these pills too long, longer than
      necessary to see the desired effects, because the prolonged
      consumption of high doses of these chemical can create imbalance
      of potassium and sodium mineral contents in human body. This
      imbalance can cause many bad side effects. For instance, potassium
      deficient diet or too much sodium intake can cause loss of
      potassium in the urine. This, in turn, may cause a water retention
      problem that increases the volume of blood and can cause high
      blood pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The pill that I am teaching in this invention, has a proper
      balance of potassium and sodium, and yet meets the amount of our
      relatively low daily needs for potassium and sodium. The amount of
      potassium minerals in 581.2 mg of KHCO3 is 226.7 mg and the amount
      of sodium minerals in 209.2 mg of NaHCO3 is 57.3 mg.<br>
      <br>
      These amounts are well below the minimum daily requirements of
      these minerals.<br>
      <br>
      To pick a more familiar example, just to give one an idea of the
      magnitude of mineral intake, one cup of unseasoned soybeans
      contains about 1080 mg of potassium and one cup of macaroni baked
      with cheese contains about 1,1 92 mg of sodium. That being the
      case, one might ask can't eating soybeans and macaroni with cheese
      do a better job than drinking alkaline water or taking this new
      chemical pill invention?<br>
      My answer is: It's not the amount of minerals that's important,
      but what that minerals are mated with that is significant. In
      alkaline water and/or my pill invention, those minerals are mated
      with hydroxyl ions (OH-) which neutralize acid hydrogen ions (H+)
      in the waste that human cells make. As explained hereinafter such
      mating is critical.<br>
      <br>
      When one drinks high pH alkaline water, the human stomach wall
      secrets hydrochloric acid (HCI) to maintain the stomach pH value
      to acid level of 4. The stomach wall cells produce hydrochloric
      acid from three molecules, namely salt (NaCI or<br>
      KCI), water (H2 0) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The leftovers are the
      bicarbonates that goes into the blood.<br>
      <br>
      NaCI + H2O + CO2 = HCI + NaHCO3 or<br>
      KCI + H20 + CO2 = HCI + KHCO3<br>
      The more alkaline water one drinks, the more hydrochloric acid is
      secreted and thus more bicarbonates go into the blood.<br>
      <br>
      The new pill (AlkaMinTh) is already in the form of potassium and
      sodium bicarbonate which is neutral but can be converted into
      alkaline as needed by exhaling carbon dioxide by the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      As these bicarbonates are used to neutralize acid wastes, more
      carbonic acid (H2CO3) is created, and it in turn forces the lungs
      to exhale more CO2 in order to maintain our blood pH at a safe and
      stable value. People with acidosis problems, for example, are the
      ones with not enough bicarbonates.<br>
      <br>
      Calcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are available in the
      form of vitamins; however, they do not dissolve too well to be
      effective to function as acid neutralizing alkaline solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover the function and purpose is different than those of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Additional inert compounds to make a pill a slow time release
      pill, or additional coating material that spreads out the pill's
      dissolution time, of course, are well known in the art. In the
      relevant art these slow acting pills have been described by
      various terms such as extended release, sustained release,
      controlled release, delayed release, sustained action, continuous
      action and slow release. All of these terms mean essentially the
      same thing - namely, that the action of the pill is spread out
      over an extended period of time.<br>
      <br>
      Pill that are coated for a slow time release are referred to in
      the art as Enteric Coated Tablets. Another approach that is well
      known, for example, is to place the chemical compound in a
      cellulosic binder that decomposes over a period of several hours
      in the stomach or intestine environment. Such known and well
      recognized techniques may be utilized to achieve a time release
      capability for the potassium predominant compound of my invention.
      Although such time release factors are of importance to my concept
      they are not a critical feature of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      What is important, however, is the combination of potassium and
      sodium bicarbonate - perhaps in a time release form. In the
      specific example for this invention, the percentage of potassium
      bicarbonate is 73.5% while that of sodium bicarbonate is 26.5%.
      The specific inventive range should be from about 95% to about 50%
      potassium in comparison, respectively, to about 5% to about 50% of
      sodium.<br>
      <br>
      In this specification I have referred to these range values as
      being a potassium predominant mixture, in order to distinguish my
      teaching from the known art. As noted earlier, the art has
      primarily taught compound mixtures formed in the opposite
      direction wherein sodium is by far the highest percentage
      ingredient.<br>
      <br>
      The alkaline water substitute of this invention is not a medicine
      to treat or cure any disease. It does, however, neutralize excess
      body acids and helps the body dispose of such neutralized body
      acids. By so doing, the health of many people have improved in a
      natural way which is enhanced by alkaline drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      What I am focussing on in the preferred embodiment is that
      percentage which, on balance, will give the best result for each
      particular individual. Skin Resistance Measuring ("SRM") devices
      as discussed in my '511 patent, are available for tailoring
      substances to each individual's needs. In the future when such<br>
      SRM instruments become more readily available, optimum
      individualized chemical compounds may be tailor-made as
      individualized one-a-day time release pills. Such compound pills
      however, should nevertheless be formulated from 95% to about 50%
      potassium bicarbonate to about 5% to 50% percent sodium
      bicarbonate in accordance with the principles of this invention
      for best results.<br>
      <br>
      Until such individualized tailor-made SRM chemical compounds are
      available on a widespread basis, however, a time release pill
      combination of about 75% (potassium bicarbonate) to about 25%
      (sodium bicarbonate) for the primary ingredients will be used as
      an alkaline drinking water substitute.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be understood, of course, that one could also add a
      small amount of other alkaline and inert time release minerals to
      the chemical compound of this invention. However, the ratio of
      potassium bicarbonate to sodium bicarbonate should still be
      maintained within the general potassium predominant ranges set
      forth in this specification and claims.<br>
      <br>
      While my invention has been described with reference to a
      particular example of preferred embodiments, it is my intention to
      cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
      following appended claims. It is therefore requested that the
      following claims be given a liberal interpretation which is within
      the spirit and scope of my contribution to this art.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -</span>- A highly
      concentrated alkaline solution is formed by combining potassium
      hydroxide (KOH) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) so that an alkaline
      drinking water may be formulated. One part of concentrated
      alkaline additive solution is diluted with several parts of
      distilled water in a one ounce mixture. The additive is further
      characterized by combining potassium hydroxide with sodium
      hydroxide in a range of about 95% potassium hydroxide and 5%
      sodium hydroxide to about 50% potassium hydroxide to about 50%
      sodium hydroxide. One ounce bottles of 75% potassium hydroxide to
      about 25% sodium hydroxide (dilute with distilled water) are
      supplied with a droplet cap in order to conveniently add the
      additive into ordinary glass of drinking water in order to readily
      form an alkaline drinking water. <br>
