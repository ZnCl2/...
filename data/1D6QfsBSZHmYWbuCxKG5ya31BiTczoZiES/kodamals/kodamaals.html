            Thin Air</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Yoshiaki Kodama is weaving a magic carpet large enough to
      carry a ship. Conjured up from thin air at the flick of a switch,
      this slippery blanket will help transport a fully laden tanker or
      container ship across the ocean at higher speed, and using far
      less fuel, than ever before.<br>
      <br>
      Kodama is director of the Advanced Maritime Transport Technology
      Department at Japan’s National Maritime Research Institute (NMRI)
      in Tokyo. His work is just one of several major programmes under
      way in the US, Russia, Japan and Europe that focus on how to make
      ships more slippery.<br>
      <br>
      A craft that has less friction as it slides through the water will
      be far more efficient than standard ships. Slippery ships could
      travel across the sea much faster or carry a bigger load on the
      same amount of fuel, saving money and reducing pollution. This is
      crucial, considering that in 2003 more than 90 per cent of all
      goods that were sent around the globe went by ship – that’s more
      than 6 billion tonnes, and the figure is set to increase.<br>
      <br>
      A recent report from the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands
      (MARIN), based in Wageningen, says that reducing the friction and
      hence the drag on a ship’s hull could improve efficiency by up to
      20 per cent. "There is currently no other technique in naval
      architecture that can promise such savings," it says.<br>
      <br>
      But how do you make a ship slippery? So far researchers have tried
      using tiny bubbles, slippery polymers and trapped sheets of air,
      and it seems that which method is best depends on what you want to
      achieve. If you simply wish to haul more cargo at a sedate 14
      knots or so, in an environmentally responsible way using less
      fuel, then creating a carpet of microbubbles beneath a
      flat-bottomed hull may be the answer. On the other hand, the best
      option for a cargo ship expected to knife through the sea at more
      than 50 knots could be to cover the metal of the hull with a wall
      of air, effectively creating a boat in a bubble.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of drag reduction began when British engineer William
      Froude investigated the fluid dynamics of ships in the 19th
      century. As a ship moves through water it encounters three types
      of drag: wave drag, pressure drag and frictional drag. Wave
      resistance is mainly a problem at high speed, and can be minimised
      with a carefully designed hull. Streamlining can also almost
      eliminate pressure drag – the backwards pull generated by the
      pressure difference between the bow and stern as the water through
      which a ship passes divides and then recombines. The greatest
      component of drag, and the main problem to ship designers, is
      frictional drag. This comes from the interaction between the hull
      and the water around it. Its effect, says Kodama, means that a
      ship pulls a large body of water along with it as it moves.<br>
      <br>
      The region of water affected by the passage of a ship, known as
      the boundary layer, is usually measured in terms of the impact on
      flow past the hull. Typically, any water moving past the hull at
      less than 99 per cent of unobstructed flow is counted as part of
      the boundary layer. While the impact of a ship on the water around
      it decreases the further you move away from the hull, there are
      also variations between the bow and the stern. For a
      300-metre-long ship, the boundary layer might be about half a
      metre thick at the bow, say, but tens of metres thick at the
      stern.<br>
      <br>
      Frictional drag has the greatest impact on the centimetre or so
      closest to the ship, where interactions between the metal hull and
      the water are the strongest. One possible way to reduce this was
      first attempted in the early 1970s by Michael McCormick and
      Rameswar Bhattacharyya at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis,
      Maryland. They coated a cylinder with small bubbles of hydrogen
      generated by electrolysis, and dragged it through water. The
      result was a significant reduction in friction. Over the next
      decade, researchers showed that such microbubbles could decrease
      frictional drag by up to 80 per cent. However, the effect was
      difficult to replicate on real vessels.<br>
      <br>
      Now researchers in Japan have decided to tackle this problem, and
      plan to turn the promise of microbubbles into reality as part of a
      programme to develop the "Super Eco-Ship". Led by Kodama, the
      project aims to reduce a ship’s greenhouse gas emissions by a
      quarter while increasing its cargo capacity by 20 per cent,
      through a whole series of propulsion, control and design changes.
      Japan has a particular interest here, given that most of its
      imports and exports travel by ship.<br>
      <br>
      In theory, Kodama says, there is more than one mechanism by which
      microbubbles can help ships slip through water. First, the bubbles
      themselves form a sheet of air sandwiched between the water and
      the hull. Since the viscosity of air – its resistance to flow – is
      about 1 per cent that of water, the ship moves more easily.<br>
      <br>
      Another mechanism modifies the turbulence that frictional drag
      creates in the water. The less turbulence generated, the easier
      the movement of a ship through the water. The researchers have
      found experimentally that the bubbles directly modify turbulence,
      Kodama says. "In turbulent flow, bubbles at the bottom of the
      boundary layer are under very strong shear forces, and become
      highly deformed and rather flat." This change in shape seems to
      reduce turbulence, so frictional drag drops.<br>
      <br>
      Kodama’s team thought that one way to coat the hull with
      microbubbles would be to divert a little spare power from the
      engine to generate bubbles near the bow of the ship by blowing
      compressed air through a slot or porous plate. These bubbles would
      be swept backwards to almost completely coat the flat-bottomed
      hull. The buoyancy of the bubbles would tend to hold them in place
      under the ship, and those that were lost would continuously be
      replenished.<br>
      <br>
      To test the effect, Kodama’s team and researchers at Tokyo and
      Osaka Universities dragged a large steel plate drilled with holes
      capable of releasing microbubbles along a 400-metre test tank.
      They even modified two ships to release bubbles from slots near
      the bow – a 6000-tonne cargo ship and a 10,000-tonne cement
      carrier. However, in sea trials Kodama saw a net drop in drag of
      only 3 per cent. With scale models, researchers at MARIN found
      reductions of less than 10 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      These figures are nowhere near as great as theory and early tests
      might suggest. It seems there are all sorts of complications with
      applying microbubbles to real ships. For instance, there is a
      trade-off between the energy used to generate the bubbles and the
      energy saved by deploying them. Then you have to ensure that no
      bubbles reach the propeller. Propellers churning through
      air-filled water lack bite, and lose thrust. There are also many
      unknowns, such as where to locate the bubble ejectors, what bubble
      size and hull shape make best use of the effect, and crucially,
      how riding a carpet of air affects a ship’s maneuverability and
      seaworthiness.<br>
      <br>
      Some problems are easily solved. Special deflectors or careful
      design of the rear of the hull, for instance, will ensure bubbles
      don’t reach the propellers. Others issues are still under
      investigation. When the cement carrier was rigged for tests early
      last year, for example, the slots emitting the bubbles were placed
      on either side of the bow. But the bubbles did not stay under the
      ship. And in other experiments the bubble carpet was effective for
      less than 50 metres downstream of injection. The vessel has been
      contracted for further experiments in 2007. This time, Kodama
      says, the team will inject air under the hull at two or three
      places along its length.<br>
      <br>
      The good news is that there appears to be little problem with
      seaworthiness. In fact, according to the researchers in Japan and
      a series of experiments using models at MARIN, in most sea
      conditions, microbubbles either make ships more stable or have
      little effect.<br>
      <br>
      But one problem seems intractable – microbubbles are only
      effective at relatively low speeds. "The higher the flow speed,"
      says Kodama, "the greater the magnitude of turbulence. And that
      turbulence tends to drive the bubbles away from the hull." If they
      move further than a centimetre or so from the ship, all drag
      reduction is lost.<br>
      <br>
      That’s a major problem for the US navy, which not only wants good
      fuel efficiency, but also high speed. In 2000, the US Defense
      Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a programme to
      halve friction drag. Only this level of improvement, its
      researchers argued, could give meaningful increases in speed.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of full-scale ship trials, DARPA is focusing on developing
      numerical models and computer simulations that will reveal how
      drag can be cut. Two teams are competing to produce the models,
      one at Stanford University in California and the other led by
      researchers from defence contractors General Dynamics. The results
      of these models are being validated by large-scale experiments at
      a huge US navy water-tunnel facility in Memphis, Tennessee, by a
      third team led by engineer Steve Ceccio at the University of
      Michigan at Ann Arbor. This tank is capable of testing sections of
      ships 3 metres across, in flows of more than 35 knots.<br>
      <br>
      This programme aims to look at microbubbles, but also at the idea
      of coating hulls with slippery polymers by pumping them out
      through holes in the side of a vessel. Polymers are used to assist
      oil flow in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, for instance.<br>
      <br>
      It is still early days, but trials at high flow rates using
      microbubbles revealed much the same difficulties that the Japanese
      teams encountered. For the first metre or so downstream from
      bubble injection "the<br>
      friction-drag reduction is unbelievable", says Marc Perlin, a
      researcher in Ceccio’s group. "You get to near-zero drag. But then
      shear forces throw the bubbles out of the boundary layer." This
      reduces the effect significantly. But, Perlin says, microbubbles
      could work well for slow-moving tankers. "Here the bubble effect
      would persist for a long distance."<br>
      <br>
      At high speeds, polymers seem much more effective. The compounds
      the team has investigated include polyethylene oxide, which is
      used to make edible capsules for drugs, and polyacrylamide, which
      is employed as a flocculant in sewage treatment plants. The
      polymers probably won’t damage the environment, Perlin says, "but
      the navy isn’t keen on polymers because you have to carry them,
      and that reduces a ship’s payload."<br>
      <br>
      Another form of lubrication is also generating interest. An air
      film of a few millimetres thick can be formed by pumping air
      across a super-water-repellent coating on the hull. The air
      becomes trapped next to the coating in preference to water,
      helping to reduce the friction between water and hull.<br>
      <br>
      Yet Perlin and other researchers think that the best solution
      might come from a concept already explored by Russian engineers:
      air cavities. Although there has been little comment from DARPA,
      this idea is clearly under scrutiny at the agency, judging from
      the title of one of its latest research programmes: Air Cavity
      Drag Reduction (AirCat).<br>
      <br>
      The plan is to look at ways to inject air into large cavities in
      the side and bottom of a specially designed hull (see Diagram).
      Air pockets sandwiched between the boat and the water should make
      a highly effective lubricant. Tests on models show it is possible
      to create stable cavities that cut drag by a factor of 5. Yet the
      project aims to reduce hull contact with water by a whopping 80
      per cent, and to sustain these air cavities at all speeds and in
      all sea conditions. An AirCat-equipped ship could use sensors to
      monitor its air cavities, say, and optimise their shape using
      motors attached to movable panels.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of air cavities has much in common with supercavitation,
      in which a submerged object such as a torpedo creates a single
      large bubble around itself. This slashes skin friction, bringing
      remarkable speeds within reach (New Scientist, 22 July 2000, p
      26). Perhaps not surprisingly, Russian engineers who first
      developed supercavitating torpedoes have not only done plenty of
      research on air-cavity lubrication for ships, but have also put
      their ideas to work.<br>
      <br>
      Since the 1980s, Russian shipyards have delivered at least 50
      vessels, including patrol boats, ferries and landing craft, that
      are equipped with cavities in the hull. Pump air into them and
      they reduce drag by up to 40 per cent, yet require just 3 per cent
      of the vessel’s power to maintain. Most of these craft incorporate
      a stepped or notched hull to create a V-shaped cavity into which
      air is pumped. One of the advantages of this technology is that it
      can be retrofitted by fixing wedge-shaped segments across a hull
      to create steps. Engineers at the Krylov Shipbuilding Research
      Institute in St Petersburg say they can build low-speed ships that
      save up to 20 per cent in fuel, and high-speed ships that save
      even more. And you can already buy a high-speed motor yacht
      equipped with this technology.<br>
      <br>
      But would it be money well spent? MARIN used models to compare air
      cavities, air films and microbubbles, and found that all resulted
      in net energy savings. "In our experiment," says Cornel Thill, a
      senior project manager at MARIN, "microbubbles were the least
      efficient, saving just a few per cent. The air film was better,
      and the air cavities performed the best." Thill thinks that this
      ranking could easily change as research progresses.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the details, drag reduction is an idea whose time has
      come, says Thill. He and his colleagues plan to build an
      air-lubricated motorised barge by 2009. And the Rotterdam-based DK
      Group, a company aiming to develop air cavity vessels, is working
      with Danish naval architects Knud E. Hansen to develop an
      air-cavity system for cruise liners, tankers and container ships.
      Eventually it aims to build a high-speed freighter that can cross
      the Atlantic in two-and-a-half days, about a quarter of the time
      taken by conventional ships. At that rate, who needs a magic
      carpet which flies in the air?<br>

        <b>US2011259440 </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A inject gas control device that performs, for example, control
      reflecting variation in vessel velocity over time without
      adversely affecting the main engine is realized. That is, it is
      prevented that gas is drawn too much and thereby a gas supply or
      charged air rate becomes insufficient, efficiency of the main
      engine is decreased and exhaust gas is deteriorated, and analogous
      events occur because the gas supply or charged air rate is too
      much instead. There are provided a main engine 4010 acquiring
      propelling power for a vessel 1, and a turbocharger 4011 that is
      driven by exhaust gas from the main engine 4010 and blows
      pressurized gas to the main engine 4010. A part of the pressurized
      gas and/or exhaust gas is drawn from between the turbocharger 4011
      and the main engine 4010 (5023, 5024 and 5025).; The drawn
      pressurized gas and/or exhaust gas are injected in the proximity 9
      of the hull on or below the waterline (5040), and the drawing rate
      of the pressurized gas and/or the exhaust gas is controlled on the
      basis of a physical quantity related to a heat load on the main
      engine 10 and characteristics of the turbocharger (4200).<br>

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To keep the efficiency of a main engine by
      favorably supplying exhaust gas to a turbocharger, and to reduce
      the frictional resistance of a ship by controlling the jetting

      bottom while forming no operational trouble of the ship.
      ;SOLUTION: When reducing the frictional resistance of a ship 1 by
      jetting gas in a vicinity of a hull below the draft line of the
      ship 1, gas to be jetted in a vicinity of the hull from the
      periphery of a turbocharger for supplying pressurized gas to a
      main engine 10 is taken out, and the efficiency of a main engine
      10 is kept in the predetermined range by controlling a variable
      means (a variable nozzle) for improving the air supply
      characteristic of the turbocharger according to at least the
      take-out status, and/or the gas jetting state is controlled by a

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a frictional resistance reduction
      device for a ship capable of properly changing the site of
      producing a bubble and the amount of bubbles according to a
      navigation state of a ship or the state of the ship, capable of
      effectively reducing frictional resistance by accurately blowing
      out the bubbles even when there is a disturbance, and capable of
      using an action of producing bubbles. SOLUTION: The frictional
      resistance reduction device for the ship comprises: a ship 1; a
      plurality of gas blowing openings 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 for blowing
      out the bubble at ship's bottom of the ship; a plurality of
      blowers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 corresponding to the plurality of gas
      blowing openings for supplying the gas to the plurality of gas
      blowing openings; an electric motor for driving the plurality of
      air supply means; a navigation state detection part A110, a
      navigation state detection part B115 for detecting the navigation
      state of the ship; and a comparator 140 and a controller 150 for
      changing an air supply state by controlling the blower according
      to detection results of these navigation state detection parts.;
      The frictional resistance reduction device blows out the bubble by
      suppressing variation with respect to the disturbance such as a
      wave, and increases a reduction effect of the net frictional
      resistance by changing the number of gas blowing openings or the
      blowing amount of the bubble according to the navigation state.<br>
