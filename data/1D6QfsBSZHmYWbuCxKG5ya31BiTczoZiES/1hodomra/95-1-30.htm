        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          The operation of this circuit recently was described by
          McClain and Wootan on the Keelynet BBS and in the January 1995
          issue of <i>New Energy News</i>. Basically, the circuit
          consists of a low-level sine wave generator operating in the
          order of 20 KHz to 40 KHz driving a specially wound 1:1 ratio
          transformer using a barium ferrite <u>magnet</u> as a core.
          The input and output coils had about 150 turns of magnet wire.
          The driving source was coupled to the transformer through a
          large barium titanate (?) piezo element making this in fact a
          series resonant circuit. The output coil was coupled to a
          bridge rectifier to develop a DC output power across an
          external resistive load. You are referred to the original
          releases for more data on this circuit. The important factor
          here is that in the <u>original</u> test the apparent <u>real</u>
          input power may have been only about 0.7 watts, but the DC
          output power developed in the load was about 2.75 watts! If
          these measurements were realm then there was about a 4 times
          power gain developed here! Where did this extra power come
          from? </p>

          II. Crude Test of an MRA-Type Circuit </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          While I did not have the actual circuit elements as used by
          McClain and Wootan, I felt that this circuit was but a <u>specialized






            application</u> of a typical series resonant circuit
          consisting of a capacitance and an inductance having some
          unavoidable series resistance. I had available an old
          tube-style signal generator which ranged from 20 Hz to about
          200 KHz which could develop only about 4 mW of <u>real</u>
          power across its 5 KOhms internal output load (at 100 KHz).
          The unloaded voltage output was about 4.5 volts (AC rms) and
          they short-circuit rms current was about 0.9 ma. I had plenty
          of capacitors (including some 'piezo' type ceramics) to test
          in this circuit. For the transformer, I had some small potted
          transformers in which the coils were wound on a ferrite core
          (unmagnetized) having a 1/4" diameter and a length of 3/4".
          The primary winding appeared to have in the order of 500 turns
          of about #30 magnet wire, while the secondary may have had 1/5
          of this number of turns. The original purpose for these units
          was unknown, but the units were marked as 5.0 mH and a 5:1
          ratio. Since the possible output was expected to be low-level,
          the load in the output was made an LED device rated at 10 ma
          at 1.85 volts DC. The test circuit was thus as follows: </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">Before
I







          give some test results, lets briefly review some basics of
          series resonant circuits. The current 'flow' in a capacitor <u>leads</u>
          the voltage by 90° in phase, while the current 'flow' in an
          inductor <u>lags</u> the voltage by 90° in phase. Thus in a
          series resonant circuit the voltages across the C and L are
          180° out of phase <u>bu</u>t the currents are equal and
          remain in phase. At resonance, the inductive reactance and the
          capacitive reactance are equal and thus cancel out, leaving
          the current to be determined by the driving source and the
          resistance which remains. However, above resonance the
          capacitive reactance decreases and the inductive reactance
          increases, while the opposite conditions prevail below
          resonance. At resonance, the voltages across the elements are
          greater than the source voltage and depend upon the element
          Q's. Moreover, when energy is being 'stored' in the inductor's
          H-field, energy is being <u>returned</u> to the circuit from
          the capacitor's E-field, and vice versa. The power available
          is 'lossless' power or a purely reactive power in ideal
          reactances, but practical reactances always have some loss
          mechanisms, primarily of a resistive nature. Under such
          conditions we should use the term impedance rather than
          reactance. The reactive power of an inductor can be 'impedance
          matched' to useful <u>real</u> load power by the use of
          transformer action. At the high frequencies, the cores of
          these transformers are generally made of ferrite-type
          materials for reduced 'eddy current' losses and also good
          response to the high frequency changes. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          III. Optimization of MRA-Type Circuits </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          To maintain a high reactive power, the reactance of the
          circuit element must be high compared to any resistive or <u>other</u>
          loss mechanisms. This will be expressed in the quality factor,
          or Q, of that element. Thus, high Q is most desirable in
          series resonant circuits. This will result in 'sharp' resonant
          frequencies and 'high' circulating currents at resonance.
          Since reactive power is equal to i<sup>2</sup>X, high Q
          generally will also mean high reactive powers. Also, the
          voltage across either the inductor or capacitor will be equal
          to QV<sub>g</sub> where V<sub>g</sub> is the voltage of the
          source generator. Thus, the voltage across the reactances can
          be many times the source voltage at resonant conditions. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;"><br>
          So far, we have considered normally accepted reactance and
          transformer theory. In this particular test, the following
          additional observations may also be made. During resonance,
          the capacitor and the inductor are continually being 'charged'
          and 'discharged' at the rate of the resonant frequency, which
          in the case of Figure (1) was in the order off 90 KHz. Now in
          terms of my Rhysmonic theory, the particular reactive elements
          used there can also '<u>interact</u>' with space energy during
          these cycles. It is believed that the prime source of space
          energy in this case may be that of the earth's gravity field,
          although there are probably <u>many</u> other <u>sources</u>
          out there in space. I have used capacitors and inductors as
          'detection' elements in many of my GW (<u>G</u>ravity <u>W</u>ave)

          detectors and gravimeters and have made much of the early data
          on these aspects available to interested researchers. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">To
          emphasize these interactions with space energy, e.g., the
          earth's g-field, the capacitors and inductors should be fairly
          large size and of high Q. The choice for the capacitor <u>probably</u>
          should be planar type piezo elements, and the various coil
          construction probably should contain ferrite-type cores. My
          past experience has been that capacitors are effective in GW
          detectors where high circuit gains make the small signals
          which appear in such capacitors useful, but cols may be more
          effective in terms of power <u>extraction</u> from the latent
          space energy (Ref. 2). For this very reason it was observed
          that the circuit of Figure (1) had higher power gains (more
          efficiency) when the circuit was operated somewhat above
          resonance, or about 100 KHz! Here, X<sub>C</sub> was reduced
          and X<sub>L</sub> was <u>increased</u>. Also, the <u>real</u>
          current being drawn from the source drops sharply. Thus, the
          real power being drawn from the driving source is greatly
          reduced, but the reactive power in coil L<sub>1</sub> is
          increased more than what had been obtained there at <u>peak</u>
          resonance. That reactive power present in coil L<sub>1</sub>
          can then be 'impedance matched' efficiently to a resistive
          load, e.g., the LED, across the secondary coil, L<sub>2</sub>,
          by the use of transformer action, where it becomes useful
          power output. <br>

Experimental







          Results <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">By
          carefully adjusting the frequency of the driving source in the
          circuit of Figure (1), it was possible to <u>brightly</u>
          light the LED device used as a load. The brightness was
          roughly equivalent to that seen when the LED was operated at a
          DC level of 1.85 volts and a current of 10 ma, or about 18.5
          mW DC power level. It was only possible to light the LED <u>directly</u>
          by the signal source only very <u>dimly</u> at 100 KHz.
          Checked against a DC level, that brightness was found to be
          equivalent to 1.85 volts at 1 ma or about 1.85 mW of DC power!
          The <u>real</u> power being expended by the driving source
          was about 4.53 volts (AC rms) at 0.41 ma (rms) and thus the
          driving source was also in the order of 1.84 mW. Thus my
          digital meter here was fairly close in rms readings. It can
          only be concluded here that the MRA-type test performed here
          seems to indicate a real power gain of about <u>10 times</u>!!

          This power is believed to be coming from the aether in a
          process somewhat as expressed here. <br>

type







          performance was also seen in a test circuit where the
          transformer coils were salvaged from a 120 V to 25 VAC
          transformer. The coils had about a 3/4" square opening into
          which I inserted two barium ferrite <u>magnets</u> which I
          obtained from Radio Shack as part # 64-1877. <br>

          Conclusions <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 30pt 0.0001pt 0.5in;">While
this







          was but a crude test using some materials which I had
          available, it does tend to <u>support</u> the claims of
          McClain and Wootan as reported in their MRA releases on the
          Internet. However, here I have tried to offer some other
          speculative insights into the nature of this circuit and the <u>source</u>
          of the additional energy 'seen' with this circuit. Perhaps
          some of you can help to develop this approach further and thus
          also help to establish the <u>reality</u> of the <u>extraction</u>
          of some of the vast latent energy present in all of space!
          Possibly, winding coils on the ferrite forms found in many AM
          radios (used as antennae) could be a good place to start? In
          any event, good luck with your tests. </p>
