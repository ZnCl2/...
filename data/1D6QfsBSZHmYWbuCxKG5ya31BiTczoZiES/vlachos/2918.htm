              Automotive Vehicle Power Plant, Chassis and Running Gear</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>( 29 December 1959 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to transportation and more particularly
        to a power plant primarily designed to be incorporated in and
        drive an automobile and also to a chassis for such vehicle. </p>
      <p>Many different types of automotive vehicles have been proposed
        and utilized over the years and these have ranged from the early
        steam-powered vehicles to the present day highly developed
        automotive vehicle, the great majority of which utilize a
        hydrocarbon fuel, such as gasoline or fuel oil in an internal
        combustion engine. While the early vehicle, both of the
        steam-powered type and the internal combustion engine (IC)
        driven type, were relatively heavy in comparison to the
        horsepower supplied by the power plant, the present day
        automotive vehicle has reached a high degree of perfection and
        the weight:horsepower ratio is very favorable. However, under
        certain conditions it may be desirable to provide an automotive
        vehicle incorporating a power plant which does not utilize a
        hydrocarbon fuel, and also one which is relatively light and
        small. </p>
      <p>In further consideration of the rough and difficult terrain
        over which vehicles are required to operate, it is sometimes
        advantageous that driving power be applied to all of the ground
        engaging wheels of such vehicle and in the past, this has been
        provided with considerable success insofar as trucks or other
        heavy vehicles are concerned, but in the smaller vehicles, such
        as passenger or pleasure cars, the inclusion of 4-wheel drive or
        drive to all the ground-engaging wheels has usually not been
        included because of the relatively high cost thereof. With a
        single prime mover, such as the IC engine, which is utilized in
        substantially all present day automotive vehicles, it is
        necessary in order to provide driving power to all 4 wheels to
        include relatively complex and costly power transmission
        systems, and this complex mechanism has materially increased the
        danger of failure due to wear or breakage and therefore, in
        addition to the relatively high initial cost, the cost of
        maintenance is also relatively high. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, the present invention contemplates the
        provision of an automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant
        in which a comparatively volatile liquid is vaporized by the use
        of electrical energy to provide a gas at a relatively high
        pressure which gas is supplied to individual reversible motors
        mounted on each ground engaging wheel and in which a
        comparatively volatile liquid is vaporized by the use o
        electrical energy to provide a gas at a relatively high pressure
        which gas is supplies to individual reversible motors mounted on
        each ground engaging wheel and in which the exhaust gas from
        such motors is returned to a condenser where the same is
        condensed and the liquid subsequently returned to the chambers
        within which the liquid is vaporized. A suitable gas driven pump
        for returning such liquid from the condenser to the chambers is
        supplied as well as suitable controls for controlling the
        direction of movement of the motors as well as the speed
        thereof. The invention further contemplates the provision of a
        chassis made up of tubular members and in which certain of such
        tubular members are utilized to provide gas pressure chambers in
        which the liquid is vaporized to provide the driving power for
        the motors. </p>
      <p>It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide an
        automotive vehicle of improved and economical construction and
        incorporating a power plant which serves to deliver power to
        individual motors mounted on each ground-engaging wheel. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is the provision of an
        automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant utilizing a
        fluorocarbon liquid which is vaporized to provide a high
        pressure gas for driving as motors and in which the exhaust from
        such motors is condensed and the liquid returned to the chambers
        in which the vaporization of the liquid takes place. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is the provision of an
        automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant utilizing a power
        plant utilizing a fluorocarbon liquid disposed in a pair of
        chambers and incorporating electrical heating means for
        vaporizing the liquid in each chamber and in which the resulting
        high pressure gas may be supplied from either or both chambers
        to gas motors for driving the vehicle and with the exhaust from
        such motors condensed and the liquid returned to either or both
        chambers. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is the provision of an
        automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant utilizing a
        liquid which is vaporized to provide high pressure gas for
        driving individual gas motors located on the ground engaging
        wheels of the vehicle and in which the liquid is vaporized by
        electrical heating elements energized from a storage battery and
        in which electrical generator means is provided for partially
        restoring energy to such storage battery. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Still further object of the invention is the provision of
        an automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant including
        chambers in which a liquid is vaporized to provide a high
        pressure gas for driving gas motors directly connected to the
        ground engaging wheels of the vehicle and in which suitable
        control means is provided for controlling the direction of
        motion and the speed o operation of the motors. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is the provision of an
        automotive vehicle incorporating a power plant utilizing a high
        pressure gas obtained from liquid in chambers and I which such
        gas serves to drive individual motors mounted on the ground
        engaging wheels of the vehicle and in which the chambers for
        vaporizing the liquid constitute a part of the chassis of the
        vehicle. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is the provision of a vehicle
        incorporating a power plant utilizing a liquid which is
        vaporized to provide high pressure gas and in which one or more
        gas motors are driven by such high pressure gas to provide a
        prime move and with the exhaust from such motor or motors
        condensed and the liquid returned to the chambers for subsequent
        vaporization. </p>
      <p>Further objects and advantages of the invention will be
        apparent from the following description taken in conjunction
        with the accompanying drawings wherein: </p>
      <p>Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of an automotive vehicle
        constructed in accordance with the invention and showing the
        structure of the chassis as well s the structure and manner of
        installation of the power plant. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 is a diagrammatic plan view to an enlarged scale of
        the front portion of the vehicle shown in Figure 1; and </p>
      <p>Figure 3 is a diagrammatic plan view to an enlarged scale and
        showing the rear portion of the vehicle shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>With continued reference to the drawings, there is shown an
        automotive vehicle constructed in accordance with this invention
        and which may well include a chassis 10 having rear ground
        engaging wheels 11 and steerable front ground engaging wheels
        12. The chassis 10 may be provided with a front bumper 13 and
        with a rear bumper 14. </p>
      <p>As shown the chassis may well comprise elongated tubular side
        members 15 and 16 which are disposed in spaced parallel
        relationship and these side members may be connected by a
        plurality of tubular cross members 18 adjacent the rear end of
        the chassis 10. As shown the side members 15 and 16 are provided
        intermediate the length thereof with enlarged elongated tubular
        portions 21 and 22 which serve to provide chambers, the purpose
        of which will be later described. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the tubular side members 15 and 16 of the
        chassis 10 include elongated tubular sections 21 and 22 of
        enlarged diameter and as best shown in Figure 2, these sections
        provide gas pressure generator chambers 87 and 88. These
        chambers 87 and 88 are partially filled with a liquid, the
        nature of which will be described later, and disposed within the
        chamber 87 is an electrical heating element 89, which may be
        supported at the closed end 90 of the chamber 87, as shown in
        Figure 2, and the opposite end of the heating element 89 may be
        supported in a similar manner. A suitable terminal 91 is
        provided for connecting a source of electrical energy to one end
        of the heating element 89 may be supported in a similar manner.
        A suitable terminal 91 is provided for connecting a source of
        electrical energy to one end of the heating element 89 and, of
        course, a similar terminal will be provided at the opposite end
        of the heating element. In a similar manner, an electrical
        heating element 92 is provided in the chamber 88, as at 93, and
        a suitable terminal will likewise be provided at the opposite
        end of the heating element 92. </p>
      <p>A gas supply manifold 95 connects the chambers 87 and 88 and
        disposed in the manifold 95 is a 3-way gas supply valve 96. The
        3-way valve 96 is provided with a valve plug 97 having a passage
        98 therein and a conduit 99 is connected to the valve 96 and may
        receive gas from either or both chambers 87 and 88 depending
        upon the setting of the valve plu 97. The conduit 99 is
        connected to a combined forward, reverse, and throttle control
        lever 102 mounted on a steering column 103 in a position
        convenient to the operator of the vehicle. The steering column
        103 may be provided with additional control levers 104 for
        operating the brakes or for performing other functions and there
        may also be provided a steering wheel 105 mounted on the upper
        end of the steering column 103. </p>
      <p>A gas driven reversible motor 106 is provided for driving one
        of the front round engaging wheels 12 and as shown in Figure 2,
        the casing 107 of the motor 106 is mounted upon the wheel
        suspension means and is stationary except for up and down
        movements and the rotor 108 of the motor 106 is provided with a
        shaft 109 which is secured to the hub of the wheel 12 and upon
        rotation of the rotor 108 serves t drive the wheel 12. Also
        mounted on the shaft 109 is an emergency brake 100 of any
        suitable type, but as shown, an electric brake is utilized which
        may be energized through an electric cable 111. The motor 106 is
        of the type described and claimed in my prior patent # 2725013,
        and reference is had to this patent for a full description of
        the construction and operation of the motor, Since such
        structure and operation form no part of the instant invention,
        any further detailed description thereof is considered
        unnecessary, it being considered sufficient to state that the
        motor 106 will be described in accordance with the principles
        disclosed in the above mentioned patent and will be of such size
        as to provide the necessary power for driving the ground
        engaging wheel. In a similar manner a drive motor 112 is
        provided for the other front ground engaging wheel 12 and motors
        113 and 114 are provided for the rear ground engaging wheels 11.
      </p>
      <p>The motors 106 and 112 are connected by a conduit 115 which in
        turn is connected to the control valve 100 and the motors 106
        and 112 are likewise connected by a second conduit 16 which is
        also connected to the control valve 100. Conduit 115 may serve
        to supply gas to the motors 106 and 112 for operation of the
        same in a forward direction during which operation the conduit
        116 would serve as an exhaust. For operation in the opposite
        direction, gas will be supplied to the motors 106 and 112
        through te conduit 116 while the conduit 115 will serve as an
        exhaust. </p>
      <p>In a similar manner, the motors 113 and 114 on the rear wheels
        11 are connected by a conduit 117 which in turn is connected
        through a conduit 118 with the control valve 100 and the motors
        113 and 114 are also connected by a conduit 119 which is
        connected through a conduit 120 with the control valve 100. By
        means of this arrangement, the motors 113 and 114 may be
        supplied with gas for operation of the same in a forward
        direction and during such operation, the conduits 117 and 118
        will serve as a path for the exhaust gas flowing from the otors
        113 and 114. it will, therefore, be seen that upon appropriate
        operation of the control vavle 100 that all of the motors 106,
        112, 113, and 114 may be operated in either direction and that
        upon actuation of the accelrator pedal 101, the speed of the the
        motors may be increased or decreased at the will of the
        operator. It is to be understood that for normal operation that
        the gas for operation of the motors will be supplied from either
        one of the chambers 87 or 88 but where an additional volume of
        gas is required, the 3-way valve 96 may be adjusted to provide
        gas simultaneously from both chambers 87 and 88. </p>
      <p>As will be seen from the above, the exhaust gas from all of the
        motors is returned to the control valve 100 and leading from
        such control valve is a single exhaust conduit 121 which is
        connected to a condenser 122. Condenser 122 may be of any
        desired type and will be cooled by airflow in order to condense
        the gas flowing thereto through the exhaust conduit 121. If
        desired, fans or other means may be employed to provide a
        sufficient airflow to the condenser 122 to condense the entire
        volume of gas flowing thereto through the conduit 121. </p>
      <p>In order to provide protection against explosion or damage due
        to excess gas pressure a conventional pressure relief valve may
        be provided which will open at a predetermined pressure to
        bypass gas from the conduit 99 to the condenser 122. </p>
      <p>A liquid return fitting 123 may be provided on the condenser
        122 and such fitting 123 may also be provided with a connection
        124 for permitting convenient charging of the system with the
        liquid to be vaporized for producing the gas which is utilized
        to drive the motors mounted on the wheels. Also connected to the
        return fitting 123 is a liquid return conduit 125 which is
        connected to the intake of a liquid return pump 126. Pump 126 is
        driven by a gas motor 127 similar to the motors utilized on the
        wheels of the vehicle and motor 127 is provided with gas through
        a conduit 128 connected to the control valve 96 in the gas
        supply header 95. The exhaust from the motor 127 is conducted
        through a pipe 129 to the condenser 122. </p>
      <p>A liquid return header 130 is connected between the chambers 87
        and 88 at the end opposite to the manifold 95 and the header 130
        is provided with a valve plug 132 having a passage 133 therein.
        Connected to the valve 131 is a conduit 134 which in turn is
        connected to the discharge outlet of the liquid return pump 126.
        It will be seen that upon operation of the pump 126 that liquid
        will be withdrawn from the condenser 122 and returned to either
        or both of the chambers 87 and 88 through the conduit 134 and
        liquid return header 130 depending upon the setting of the 3-way
        valve 131. </p>
      <p>A storage battery 144 may be provided and serves as a source of
        electrical energy for the electrical heating elements 89 and 92
        disposed in the chambers 87 and 88 and also electrical energy
        may be obtained from the battery 144 for operating the electric
        emergency brake 110 and for any other purpose desired, such as
        lights, signals, and the like. If desired, a suitable control in
        the form of a rheostat or the like may be connected between the
        battery 144 and the heating elements 89 and 92 in order to
        control the operation thereof. In order to partially restore the
        electrical energy drained from the battery 144, there may be
        provided electrical generators 145 and 146 mounted on the rear
        wheel motor shaft and during coasting of the vehicle or running
        downhill, the generators 145 and 146 will serve to partially
        restore electrical energy to the battery 144. Obviously, the
        generators 145 and 146 cannot completely recharge the generators
        145 and 146 cannot completely recharge the battery 144 since
        there are numerous losses resent in the power plant and it will
        consequently be necessary to recharge the battery 144 from an
        external source at suitable intervals. </p>
      <p>While other liquids may be employed in the chambers 87 and 88,
        it has been found that the most suitable liquid for use in a
        vehicle of this invention is a fluorocarbon which has a boiling
        point of approximately 135 degrees F and it is proposed to
        utilize a gas pressure obtained by vaporizing such fluorocarbon
        liquid in the chambers 87 and 88 of the order of 100 to 500 psi,
        depending on the power requirements of the vehicle. While, as
        stated, other liquids may be employed, it has been found that
        fluorocarbon is the most satisfactory since such liquid is
        nonflammable, nontoxic, and is completely stable at the
        temperatures and pressure contemplated. The fluorocarbon liquid
        is a conventional commercially available product. Since the
        power plant of this invention utilizes a completely closed
        system, once the same is charged with a suitable liquid, such as
        the fluorocarbon mentioned above, no additional liquid will be
        necessary except to replace any which may be lost as a result of
        leakage or damage. Consequently, the only cost of operation
        insofar as the supply of power is concerned is the recharging of
        the battery 144. </p>
      <p>In operating the vehicle of this invention, it is only
        necessary to energize one or both of the electrical heating
        elements 89 and 92 which will result in vaporizing the liquid
        within the chambers 87 and 88 and upon setting of the valve 96
        gas under the desired pressure will be supplied from either or
        both of the chambers 87 and 88 to the control valve 100.
        Depending upon the setting of valve 100, the gas will be
        supplied through the conduits 115 and 117 to drive the vehicle
        in a forward direction or upon another setting of the valve 100,
        gas will be supplied to the motors through the conduits 116 and
        119 to drive the vehicle in a reverse direction. Actuation of
        the accelerator pedal 101 would serve to control the speed of
        the vehicle in either direction. Regardless of the direction in
        which the vehicle is traveling, as exhausted from the wheel
        driving motors will be conducted from the valve 100 through the
        conduit 121 to the condenser 122 by means of a liquid return
        pump 126 and depending upon the setting of the 3-way valve 131
        will be returned through the liquid return header 130 to either
        or both of the chambers 87 and 8. There is thereby provided a
        closed system in which liquid is vaporized, utilized for
        providing power and thereafter condensed and the liquid returned
        to the vaporizing chamber to be used. </p>
      <p>It is also to be noted that while the power plant has been
        described in connection with an automotive vehicle, the same
        power plant or one similarly constructed could be utilized in
        other vehicles, such as aircraft or boats, and also such a power
        plant could readily be utilized in a generating station as a
        prime mover or for any other desired stationary application. </p>
      <p>By utilizing the principles and structures described above, a
        relatively small, light-weight and highly efficient automotive
        vehicle may be provided and one in which operating cost and
        upkeep is maintained at a minimum. Furthermore, the various
        units utilized in the vehicle may be supplied as separate
        assemblies which may be conveniently assembled and installed to
        construct the entire vehicle. </p>
      <p>It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various
        changes may be made in the invention, without departing from the
        spirit and scope thereof, and, therefore, the invention is not
        to be limited by that which is shown in the drawings and
        described in the specification, but only as indicated in the
        appended claims. </p>
