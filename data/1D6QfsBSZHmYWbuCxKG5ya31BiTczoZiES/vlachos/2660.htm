      <p>This invention is a power converter. </p>
      <p>It is one object of the invention to provide a power converter
        which is particularly adapted to convert the potential energy
        from a gas under pressure to a liquid under pressure. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a power converter
        which is simple in construction and may be manufactured at low
        cost and is not liable to get out of working order. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention lies in the provision of a
        power converter which utilizes piston carrying rotors which are
        adapted to use the fluid driving the motors or being driven by
        the pump to radially move the pistons into proper engagement
        with their working surfaces. </p>
      <p>These and other objects of the invention will become apparent
        during the course of the following description. </p>
      <p>In the accompanying diagrams, forming a part of this
        specification, like numerals are employed to designate like
        parts. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> is a diagrammatic view of one application of
        the invention comprising the subject matter of this application.

      <p>The power converter of this invention is provided with a
        housing 10 having an enlarged intermediate portion 11, which
        houses a power generator or fluid pump 12, and spaced axially
        aligned reduced portions 12 which house fluid or gas driven
        motors 14. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figure 1, it will be seen that fluid motors M are
        secured to drive the four wheels W of a vehicle and are
        connected to the discharge sides 5 of fluid pump 12. The fluid
        driven thereby is thus forced through the motors M to
        effectively power the four wheels. </p>
      <p>A gas pressure generator G produces a fluid pressure by a
        burner B or the like and this fluid under pressure enters the
        motors 14 through conduit C threadedly engaged in removable
        heads 16 and causes them to rotate. The escaping gas is
        exhausted through tubes T through a condenser R from whence it
        is returned to the generator G for another cycle. Of course
        adequate valves and controls are provided for accomplishing the
        desired speed control and other necessary objects. </p>
      <p>Referring now more particularly to the power converter, it will
        be seen that the pump 12 has a base 17 which is drilled and
        tapped to receive anchoring bolts for mounting the converter. </p>
      <p>An oblong socket 18 is formed in the housing 11 from its open
        end and extends longitudinally into the body terminating in a
        faced end wall 19. The side walls 20 of socket 18 are polished
        or faced to present a smooth working surface for the cooperating
        parts. Radially extending, internally threaded and diametrically
        opposed ports 15 and 21 are provided in the housing 11 and
        communicate with socket 18. Each port is spaced from its
        adjacent ports 90 degrees on centers, thus providing four of
        said ports. </p>
      <p>As indicated in Figure 5, when the greatest transverse
        dimension of socket 18 is horizontal, the ports 15 and 21 are
        positioned 45 above and below horizontal one at each side of a
        longitudinal vertical plane. Of course, socket 18 may be
        positioned at any angle desired and the ports will then be
        provided in the same position relative to the socket. </p>
      <p>Piston carrier or rotor 22 is substantially circular in
        transverse cross section, as seen in Figure 5, and when
        positioned centric of socket 18, defines crescent shaped
        chambers 23 between the rotor and housing 11. Ports 15 and 21
        thus open into socket 18 adjacent the extreme ends of chambers
        23. It will be noted that the opposed ends of chambers 23 have
        opposite ports 15 and 21. That is, one end has an inlet port 15
        while the opposed end of the same chamber has an outlet port 21,
        and the opposed chambers 23 on their corresponding upper or
        lower ends have opposite ports. </p>
      <p>Between the ports of corresponding ends of opposed chambers 23,
        I have provided by-pass grooves 24 which communicate with socket
        18 throughout their length, and midway the length of said
        grooves, I have provided conduits 25 communicating with said
        grooves and extending longitudinally of the housing 11. Conduits
        25 terminate at their rear ends in a vertically extending
        conduit 26 which communicates midway its length with an annular
        well 27. </p>
      <p>About the mouth of socket 18, I have provided a recess 28 in
        face 29, and a matching boss 30 carried by cover plate 31 is
        fitted therein. A gasket or sealing ring 32 encircles the boss
        30 and is clamped between face 29 and cover plate 31 to seal the
        socket against leaking. The longitudinal movement of boss 30
        into socket 18 is limited by reason of shoulders defined by the
        recess 28, thus providing a proper final longitudinal dimension
        for socket 18. A packing gland 33 is formed in cover plate 31
        coaxial with socket 18 and provides a bearing and seal for stub
        shaft 34 splined into piston carrier or rotor 22. Multiple stud
        bolts 35 pass through spaced openings in cover plate 31 and
        thread into housing 11 to secure the plate thereon. </p>
      <p>Rotor or piston carrier 22 is provided with radially disposed
        longitudinally extending multiple slots about its periphery. As
        indicated in Figure 5, the rotor has a hub 36 and spaced on
        centers over 120 degrees about the periphery of the hub are
        roller receiving slots 37 having tubular roller pistons 38
        therein and positioned about the hub 60 degrees from slots 37
        are vane receiving slots 39 also occurring every 120 degrees
        about the hub from each other. </p>
      <p>Concentric with hub 36, I have provided a spline bore 42
        adapted to fit over spline 34’ of stub shafts 34 and forms a
        conduit through the hub 36. Radially extending conduits 43
        communicate with the piston receiving slots 37 and 39 midway
        their lengths. </p>
      <p>The cover plate 31 is provided with a diametric conduit 44
        which communicates with conduits 25 and terminate at the center
        of the cover with an annular well 45. Each splined stub shaft 34
        as a conduit drilled therein communicating the bore 42 with its
        cooperating well 45 or 27. Cover plate 31 carries the housing 13
        as does the opposed end of housing 11 and since the two motors
        14 are identical the description of one will suffice. Shafts 34
        may be an integral part of motor rotor 46 or it may be keyed
        therein as at 47. In each motor, there are eight equally spaced
        vanes or blades 48 and a rotor 49 serving as a carrier for the
        vanes. This rotor is of cylindrical form and comprises a hub
        portion 50 which is provided with equally spaced slots 51, which
        slots are provided at the bottom with a taper 52 and which slots
        are adapted to slidingly receive the blades. The rotor 49 is
        also provided with an extending shaft 34 at one end, and at the
        other end, with a concentrically projecting boss 53. The slots
        51 extend through the boss and the greatest depth of the slots
        is at the boss end. Forced on to this boss is a washer 54, the
        thickness of the washer corresponding to the length of the boss
        and the diameter of the washer being greater than that of the
        hub, so that it forms a protecting flange. When the washer is
        thus assembled, the slots in the boss form holes 55 (Fig. 2)
        leading from the root of the vane slots to the exterior of the
        washer. There is also provided a shell 56 for the rotor, the
        shell being bored in two stepped diameters and faced at the end
        of the largest diameter. The smaller bore 57 is concentric and
        of a size adapted to loosely receive the shaft 34 of the rotor,
        and the larger bore 58 is oblong in the form of a socket, which
        socket receives the rotor and is covered by the flange of the
        washer 54. The periphery of this housing serves as a valve for
        four radial ports 60. There is a 60 degree spacing between the
        ports, and the vanes are 45 degrees apart, so tat there are
        always two blades between the ports. </p>
      <p>When the rotor is in place, by inserting its shaft into the
        shaft hole 59, pressure from the washer end of the carrier will
        force the hub against the bottom of the socket and will force
        the flange against the faced end of the shell, so that there
        will be two crescent shaped chambers formed between the rotor
        and shell, the end walls of which chambers will be formed, one
        from the shell and the other from the flange or shroud-like
        extension of the washer. </p>
      <p>The fluid pressure enters longitudinally and is directed
        against the exterior of the washer with a consequent passage
        through the holes 55 to beneath the vanes, the resultant being
        that the vanes are forced outwardly and also by reason of the
        end pressure are forced longitudinally against the bottom of the
        socket. The resultant is that all points of the rectangular
        chamber are sealed and are yieldingly held in permanently sealed
        relation against wear. </p>
      <p>The housing 13 is internally bored at 61 with a conical hole
        forming a valve sear for the external valve surface of the
        housing. Internally of the housing 13 and running longitudinally
        are two pairs of channels 62 and 63, the channels of each pair
        being diametrically opposed. The channels lead from over the
        port when the housing and shell are assembled, one pair of the
        channels leading toward one end of the housing, and the other
        pair leading toward the other end of the housing. </p>
      <p>There is provided in the housing an annulus 84 into which, when
        assembled, one pair of the shell channels lead, the annulus
        forming a connecting conduit to connect such channels. In the
        housing 13 is a pipe hole 55 which leads into an internal
        annulus 66 of the housing, which internal annulus comates with
        an annulus 64 in the shell. The other pair of channels leads to
        the flanged ends of the device where chambers 65 are formed,
        which chambers are closed by heads 16 screwed into pipe threads
        66 internal of the housings 13, which threads are of a diameter
        permitting the passage or insertion of the housing, so that when
        a fluid under pressure is admitted through the pipe connection
        at this point, the fluid is directed against the washer and also
        passes through one pair of the shell channels and thence through
        one pair of the ports; but if the shell 56 is turned 90 degrees
        in relation to the housing, then the fluid passes through the
        other pair of ports, thus reversing the direction of rotation of
        the rotor. A lever 67 is provided on the shell56 and extends
        outwardly of the housing 13 for reversing the motor. </p>
      <p>Inspection of Figure 2 will reveal that the stub shafts are
        splined at 34’ into each end of the bore 42 uniting both motors
        14 to rotate with the pump 12 as a unit. </p>
      <p>Having thus described my invention, I claim: [ Claims not
