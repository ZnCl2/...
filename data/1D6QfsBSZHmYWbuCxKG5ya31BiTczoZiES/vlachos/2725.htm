              Rotary Engine</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>( 29 November 1955 )</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to piston carriers, housings therefor
        and rotary engines. </p>
      <p>One object of the invention is to provide a rotary engine which
        may effectively function as a motor, pump, or compressor. Rotary
        movement applied to the rotor performs the function of a pump or
        compressor, and fluid under pressure when applied through inlet
        ports causes the engine to perform as a motor. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention lies in the provision of fluid
        pressure means for shifting related parts of the engine into
        working position and thereby making compensation for any wear
        which may be present among the parts and thus maintain a perfect
        fluid seal between working parts. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention lies in the provision of an
        engine that is nearly silent in its operation and which may be
        run in either direction to perform the function required of it.
      </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention lies in the provision of an
        engine which may be operated in any position with equal
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be
        apparent during the course of the following description. </p>
      <p>In the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this
        specification, and in which like numerals are employed to
        designate like parts throughout the same. </p>

        same. </p>

        <p><img src="2725-3.jpg" height="305" width="407"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Inspection of the drawing will reveal that the exemplified form
        of my invention has a cast housing 4 comprising a body 5 and a
        base 6. The base is drilled and tapped to receive anchoring
        bolts 7 for mounting the engine for use. </p>
      <p>An oblong socket 8 is formed in the body 5 from its front face
        9 and extends longitudinally into the body terminating in a
        faced end wall 10. The side walls 11 of socket 8 are also
        polished or faced to present a smooth working surface for the
        cooperating parts. A bearing well 12 is formed coaxially of
        socket 8 and in end wall 10 and a bronze, or other type, bushing
        13 is pressed therein to form a bearing for the rotor described
        hereafter. </p>
      <p>Radially extending, internally threaded and diametrically
        opposed ports 14 are provided in the body 5 and communicate with
        socket 8. Each port is spaced from its adjacent ports 90 degrees
        on centers, thus providing four of said ports. </p>
      <p>As indicated in Figure 3, when the greatest transverse
        dimension of socket 8 is horizontal, the ports 14 are positioned
        45 degrees above and below horizontal ones on each side of a
        longitudinal vertical plane. Of course, socket 8 may be
        positioned at any angle desired and the pots will then be
        provided in the same position relative to the socket. </p>
      <p>Piston carrier or rotor 15 is substantially circular in
        transverse cross section, as seen in Figure 3, and when
        positioned centric of socket 8 adjacent crescent shaped chambers
        16 between the rotor and housing 4. Ports 14 thus open into
        socket 8 adjacent the extreme ends of chambers 16. It will be
        noted by the arrows of Figure 1 and 3 that the opposed ends of
        chambers 16 have opposite ports 14. That is, one end has an
        inlet port while the opposed end of the same chamber has an
        outlet port, and the opposed chambers 16 on their corresponding
        upper or lower ends also have opposite ports. </p>
      <p>Between the ports of the corresponding ends of opposed chambers
        16, I have provided bypass grooves 17 which communicate with
        socket 8 throughout their length, and midway the length of said
        grooves, I have provided conduits 18 communicating with said
        grooves and extending longitudinally of the housing 4. Conduits
        18 terminate at their rear ends in a vertically extending
        conduit 19 which communicates midway its length with the bearing
        well 12. </p>
      <p>About the mouth of socket 8, I have provided a recess 20 in
        face 9, and a matching boss 21 carried over by cover plate 22 is
        fitted therein. A gasket or sealing ring 23 encircles the boss
        21 and is clamped between face 9 and cover plate 22 to seal the
        socket against leaking. The longitudinal movement of boss 21
        into socket 8 is limited by reason of shoulders 24 defined by
        recess 20, thus providing a proper final longitudinal dimension
        for socket 8. A bushing 25 is pressed into cover plate 22
        coaxial with socket 8 and bearing well 12 and provides a bearing
        for shaft 26 of piston carrier or rotor 15. A packing gland and
        nut 27 are provided to seal the shaft and cover plate and
        preclude fluid leaking therebetween. Multiple stud bolts 28 pass
        through spaced openings in cover plate 22 and thread into
        housing 4 to secure the plate thereon. </p>
      <p>As seen in Figure 1, hoses 29 are adapted with fittings 31 to
        attach the hoses to ports 14 and permit fluid passage
        therethrough. </p>
      <p>Rotor or piston carrier 15 is provided with radially disposed
        longitudinally extending multiple slots about its periphery. As
        indicated in Figure 3 the rotor has a hub 31 and spaced on
        centers every 120 degrees about the periphery of the hub are
        outwardly divergent roller receiving slots 32 having tubular
        rolling pistons 33 therein and positioned about the hub 60
        degrees from slots 32 are vane receiving slots 34 also occurring
        every 120 degrees about the hub from each other. Vane pistons 35
        are carried by slots 34 and slideable therein. Positioned
        intermediate each piston receiving slot 32 and 34 I have
        provided compression slots 36. </p>
      <p>Centric of hub 31 and integral therewith, I have provided a
        stub shaft 37 adapted to rotatably fit in bearing 13, and a
        central bore 38 forms a conduit through the shaft 37 into the
        hub 31. Radially extending conduits 39 communicate with central
        conduit 38 and at their outer ends communicate with the piston
        receiving slots 32 and 34 midway their lengths. </p>
      <p>The operation of the rotary engine as a motor is as follows: </p>
      <p>Fluid under pressure (from any source not known) is introduced
        into the housing through ports 14 indicated by the arrows
        pointing inwardly. A portion of the fluid passes through grooves
        17 and conduits 18 and 19 to bearing well 12 where it flows into
        conduits 38-39 and forces pistons 33 and 35 outwardly to contact
        walls 11 of socket 8. Since the volume of fluid entering is
        greater than that which will pass through grooves 17, pressure
        is exerted upon pistons 3 and 35 which are then positioned
        beyond the respective inlet ports and in chambers 16, thus
        causing the rotor to turn. The movement of the rotor will be in
        the clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 3. However, the
        roller pistons 33 will not be in the positions shown in Figure
        3, but rather shifted clockwise in socket 8 and positioned to
        bear against the opposite side of their respective slots from
        that side shown. To reverse the direction of the motor, it is
        only necessary to reverse the direction of fluid flow and the
        motor will reverse. </p>
      <p>When operating the engine as a pump, rotary motion is applied
        to the rotor from a mechanical source. A portion of the fluid
        pressure created by the pump flows through the described
        conduits 18-19-38 and 39 to create a pressure behind the pistons
        and cause them to extend to the socket walls. The pistons create
        a reduced pressure in the intake ports and cause them to extend
        to the socket walls. The pistons create a reduced pressure in
        the intake ports and eliminate the necessity of priming the
        pump, and it is easily seen how the pistons pump the fluid
        through the chambers 16 and out of the outlet ports 14. </p>
      <p>It is theorized that the compression slots 36 provide greater
        area for creating a reduced pressure in the intake ports thus
        increasing the ability to pump and draw up its prime. It also
        provides a greater are within the housing for compression when
        the engine is so used. It is not definitely known how the
        compression slots work to enhance the ability of the engine in
        its three functions, but working models have proven that such is
        the case. </p>
      <p>Having thus described my invention, I claim: [ Claims not
