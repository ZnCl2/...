        This invention relates to a new and novel construction of a
        self-propelled vehicle, and has for its principle object a
        source of power consisting of a thermodynamic cycle, utilizing
        pressure of gas converted to hydraulic pressure to apply force
        directly to the driving wheels. This new principle of power
        application we will name the hydro-gas-power-cycle. </p>
      <p>The source of energy is heat supplied by the combustion of a
        carbonaceous fuel and air pr other source of heat energy in a
        reversed principle of the thermodynamic cycle of refrigeration
        which raises the pressure of a gas refrigerant, and by a
        pressure conversion device of new and novel construction in
        operating principle, applies pressure to a liquid, which by
        hydraulic principles and mechanical means kinetic energy is
        produced for driving the vehicle. </p>
      <p>Another object of this power plant construction is to place the
        individual functional units so as to obtain a more equal balance
        of weight suspension. </p>
      <p>A still further object of this new and novel hydro-gas-power
        application is to make possible a quiet operating engine,
        economical to operate, relatively free from vibration and
        automatic in function, bringing comfort and safety to the
        occupants of a motor vehicle. </p>
      <p>A further object of this invention is to provide a frame having
        dual functional structures. One of its functions is to provide
        part of the hydro-gas-power circuit, while the other function is
        to suspend the load to the wheels carrying out the above object.
      </p>
      <p>In order to illustrate more fully the invention, we have shown
        by drawings and description the embodiments of the construction,
        principles of operation and the basic functions of the units. </p>

      <p>Referring more specifically to the drawings: </p>
      <p>In the carrying out of the primary object of our invention in
        the development of hydro-gas power for vehicles and the like, we
        employ a reverse flow of the Carnot thermodynamic cycle
        utilizing a liquid gas refrigerant as the heat carrying media. </p>
      <p>Starting from the condensing unit 1, Figure 1, this liquid gas
        is pumped from the said condenser by way of the injection pump
        2, through a filter 3 into the gas pressure generator unit 4.
        Heat is inducted into the liquid gas in the pressure generator 4
        by the automatic oil burner 5, but not limited thereto, which is
        driven by the electric motor 6 and supplied with fuel from the
        tank 7. The automatic oil burner 5 has a two-stage combustion
        and constant fuel air ratio. </p>
      <p>When the liquid delivered to the generator 4 is converted into
        a gas by the application of heat it is delivered to a gas
        pressure motor 8, then returned back through the line 9 through
        the oil separator and dehydrator 10 and a pressure control valve
        11, driving the gas pressure operated motor 12, returning
        through the piping 13 into the condenser from where it started.
        The gas pressure operated motor 12 drives the fan 14 which
        directs air across the condensing tubes 15 of the condensing
        unit 1. </p>
      <p>The gas pressure motor 12 also drives the electric generator 16
        for charging the battery 16A, together with the fan 17 for
        cooling the hydraulic heat exchanger 18. This said heat
        exchanger will be described later. The gas pressure motor 8,
        Figures 1 and 5, is a free-floating piston type. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the valve mechanism for controlling the
        slow and expansion of the as within the gas pressure motor 8. In
        Figures 5 and 6 the motor is shown in a position with all valves
        closed. We will assume the gas under pressure is about to move
        the piston 19 in the direction of the arrow. Gas will enter
        through the manifold 20 into the valve chamber 21, through the
        valve 24 when said valve is opened admitting gas into the
        chamber 22, thence into the cylinder 30 at 23 against the piston
        head forcing the same in the direction indicated. </p>
      <p>We will now describe how the valve 24 is opened to admit this
        gas into the above said cylinder. The valve 24 is opened by way
        of the valve stem 25 and the valve lifting assembly 26, which in
        turn is operated from the cam 27 of the cam shaft 28 through the
        rocker arm 20 by way of the push rod 30. The cam shaft 28 is
        revolved by two different methods. First by an electric motor
        31, receiving its electrical energy from the battery 16A through
        the wiring 32 and the control switch 33, or by a direct drive by
        way of the universal shaft connection 34 driven from the
        hydraulic wheel motor 35 located in the left rear wheel. When
        motors 35 ad the vehicle are being operated in reverse
        direction, a universal connection 37 is driven by one of the
        other driving motors 35 driving the cam shaft always in the same
        direction of rotation as will be later described and as
        indicated by the arrow in Figures 4 and 5. When the piston 19
        travels in the direction of the arrow, exhaust gas within the
        end 38 of the cylinder 39 will be exhausted. This is
        accomplished by opening an exhaust valve 40 through its stem 41,
        valve lifting 42, operated by the cam roller 43 from the cam 44
        (Fig. 6). This permits the gases to flow from the end 38 of the
        cylinder 39 into the chamber 45 through the valve 40, through
        the port 46 into the exhaust manifold 47. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the return stroke of the piston 19 in the
        opposite direction of the arrow. When the camshaft 28 rotates
        180 from the position shown in Figure 5, the intake valve 24 and
        the exhaust 40 will remain closed for the next 180 degrees. At
        this time the cam 48 will open the intake valve 49, referring to
        Figure 5 and 6, permitting gas to enter through the manifold 20
        the chamber 45 through the intake valve 49 into the end 38 of
        the cylinder 39 behind the piston 19. The previous gas ahead of
        the piston 19 will be exhausted into the chamber 22 through the
        exhaust valve 50 into the chamber 51, thence to the exhaust
        manifold 47. The exhaust valve 50 is operated from the cam 27,
        valve lifter 20 and its valve stem 52 exhausted from the said
        gas fro the chamber 22 as above stated. </p>
      <p>In order to throttle and control the pressure within the
        cylinder 39, the amount of gas allowed to enter through the
        intake valve 21 will be controlled as follows. The push rod 30
        is pivotally seated at 53 within the valve lifter mechanism,
        referring to Figure 5, at its one end and is adapted to have its
        opposite end moved towards or away from the pivot point 54 of
        the rocker arm 29 by the connecting link 55, crank 56, which is
        associated with the control lever 57, which in turn is operated
        by the control rod 58 and throttle lever 59 conveniently located
        to the operator as shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>If it is desired to reduce the gas pressure exerted against the
        piston 19, the roller 30A of the push rod 30 is moved towards
        the pivot point 54 of the rocker arm 29. The rocker arm then
        will exert a relatively short stroke to the push rod and valve
        stem 25, consequently the valve 24 will only be slightly opened.
        In order to increase the pressure to be applied to the piston
        19, the roller 30A will be moved by the control levers 57 and 59
        above described further away from the pivot 54, at which time
        the rocker arm will exert a greater movement to the said push
        rod and valve stem 25 opening the valve 24 wider, admitting a
        greater volume of gas into the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Having just touched lightly on the cam shaft driving mechanism,
        we will now return to this mechanism describing its operation in
        further detail. Referring to Figure 4, the electric motor 31
        drives the cam shaft 28 through a coupling and gearing in a ear
        box 60 consisting of the chain of gears 61 by way of the pinion
        62 so that the cam shaft 28 will be rotating in the direction of
        the arrow, and in the same direction that the universal shaft 34
        drives the said cam from the hydraulic motor 35, as shown in
        Figure 1. </p>
      <p>The motor 31 takes care of the operation of the gas pressure
        motor when the vehicle is either standing still or at very low
        traveling speed. The universal drive shaft 34 from the hydraulic
        motor 35 takes over after a predetermined speed has been
        attained. The universal shaft 37, referring to Figures 1 and 4,
        is driven from the right rear wheel not shown, and in turn
        drives the cam shaft 28 in the direction of the arrow through
        the gear 63 and shaft 64 until the right rear wheel attains a
        speed above that of the motor driven shaft so as to drive
        through the overrunning clutch 65 while the vehicle is traveling
        in a reverse direction. When the cam shaft 28 is being operated
        by the universal 37, an over-running clutch 36 disconnects the
        drive through the universal 34 between the hydraulic motor 35 in
        the left rear wheel and the cam shaft 28. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the operation of the hydraulic pressure
        developed by the operation of the piston 19. A hydraulic pump 66
        is formed integral and part of the cylinder 39 and has a
        spring-cushioned piston 67 for developing a relatively high
        pressure within the pump 66 to be converted to a hydraulic
        pressure for operating the hydraulic motors located in the
        driving wheels of the vehicle. Referring to Figure 1, we have
        illustrated only one wheel with one hydraulic motor and one
        cylinder gas motor for convenience of illustration. There would
        be at least 3 or more cylinders in the gas motor. </p>
      <p>Hydraulic fluid is contained within any suitable reservoir as
        indicated at 68. This fluid is drawn into the pump 66 by way of
        the pipe 69, referring to Figure 5, and is drawn trough the
        check valve 70 into the said pump when the piston 67 is
        traveling in the opposite direction to the arrow. On the return
        stroke of the piston 67, in the direction of the arrow, the
        hydraulic fluid is forced out through the check valve 71 into
        the pipe line 72, throttle control valve 73, pipes 74 t the
        hydraulic motor 35, referring to Figure 11, by way of the inlet
        75, out the exhaust fitting 76, piping 77 through the emergency
        brake control valve 78 and bypass control valve 79 into the heat
        exchanger 18 back into the reservoir 63 and back to cylinder 66
        of the hydraulic pump 66-67. </p>
      <p>Our new and improved hydraulic motor 35 is built into the hub
        of the wheel and consists of a rotor housing 80 having a wheel
        axis spindle 81 formed on one of its ends and adapted to receive
        the hub 82 of the wheel 83 thereon. A rotor 84 is rotatable
        mounted within the rotor housing 80 by way of the shaft 85
        operating within bearing 86 within the housing 80 operating
        within bearing 86 within the housing 80 and extending beyond the
        said housing spindle 81 where it terminates in a splined end 87,
        which cooperates with the driving member or head 88 which forms
        part of the wheel hub 82 within the cap thereof. The wheel hub
        82 is journaled to the axis spindle 81 by way of the bearing 89.
      </p>
      <p>Extending on the opposite end of the rotor 84 to that of the
        shaft 85 is a driving shaft 90, Figure 11, which drives the
        universal drive cam shaft 34, Figure 1, and operates the above
        described drive shaft 34, Figure 1, and operates the above
        described cam shaft 28. Mounted to one end of the rotor housing
        80 is a valve housing 91, Figure 13, in which is rotatable
        mounted a cone shaped inlet and outlet valve 92 for controlling
        the hydraulic fluid for driving the said motor. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figures 11 to 17 inclusive, the valve 92, Figure
        13, is set to cause the rotor 84 to rotate in the direction of
        the arrows or clockwise as shown in Figure 17, while in the
        diagrammatical Figure 18, the valve is set to cause to he rotor
        to travel in the direction of the arrow, or anti-clockwise.
        Referring particularly to Figure 11, the cone valve 92 is
        revolved within the valve housing 91 and around the rotor shaft
        90 by the lever 93, shown in Figure 20, which is keyed to the
        hub 94 of the said valve. </p>
      <p>A floating piston 95 is adapted to operate within the cylinder
        96 which forms part of te valve operating mechanism in housing
        97. The piston 95 is operated by hydraulic fluid from an
        independent hydraulic liquid supply tank from an independent
        hydraulic fluid from an independent hydraulic liquid supply tank
        indicated at 98, Figure 1, through a standard double acting
        master cylinder 99 which is manually controlled. When the lever
        100 is moved in one direction it will move the piston 95, Figure
        20, within the cylinder 96 in this predetermined direction. </p>
      <p>This will move the lever 93, rotating the valve 92, Figure 13,
        to the position indicated in Figure 19, reversing the direction
        of the rotor 84 or opposite to the arrow indication in Figure
        17, and vice versa, the moving of the lever 100, Figure 1,
        forces fluid against the opposite end of the piston 95, Figure
        20, moving the same opposite to the arrow and rotating the crank
        93 and valve 92 to the position illustrated in the views in
        Figures 11, 16, 17 and 20. </p>
      <p>We will now follow the path of the hydraulic driving fluid from
        the source of supply and through the motor. He volume of the
        fluid supplied by the hydraulic piston 67 driven by the gas
        motor 8, Figure 1, is the same as the volume required to drive
        the hydraulic wheel driving motors 35. That is, one revolution
        of the cam shaft 28 provides one delivery stroke for each of the
        hydraulic pistons 67, Figure 5, which is the quantity or volume
        of hydraulic fluid required to rotate the hydraulic wheel motors
        35, Figures 1 and 11, one revolution each, but not limited to
        this revolution to volume ratio. </p>
      <p>This driving fluid is delivered to the valve housing 91,
        Figures 11 and 17, by way o the connection 75 from the piping
        74, Figures 1 and 11, into the port 101, Figure 17, by way of
        the connection 75 from the piping 74, Figures 1 to 11, into the
        port 101, Figure 17, and into the ports 102 and 103 located
        within the rotor housing 80 from where the fluid is directed
        against the rotor blades 104 through the bridges 105, Figures 12
        and 13, rotating the rotor in the direction of the arrow,
        referring particularly to Figure 17. </p>
      <p>The exhaust of the pressure fluid takes place through the
        bridges 105 into the exhaust ports 106, Figure 12, thence to the
        valve port 107, Figure 17, and out the outlet 76, through pipe
        77 back to the heat exchanger 18 and the remainder of the
        hydraulic circuit. When the control lever 100, Figure 1, is
        moved to a position to cause the piston 95, Figure 20, to rotate
        the valve 92, Figures 11 and 13, in the direction of the arrow,
        Figure 20, or to the position illustrated in Figure 18, the
        rotation of the rotor will be reversed due to the fact that the
        ports of the valve 92 directs the flow of fluid into the ports
        106 of the housing 80, Figure 12, directing the pressure of the
        fluid to opposite sides of the rotor driving blades or vanes
        104, rotating the rotor 84 in the direction of the arrow shown
        in Figure 18, and opposite to the rotation in direction of the
        arrow in Figure 17. The ports 102 and 103 which were inlet
        passages illustrated in Figure 17 are now exhaust passages
        illustrated in Figure 18, the fluid passing out through the
        fitting 76, Figures 17, 18, and 11, into the pipe 77, Figure 1.
      </p>
      <p>We will now describe the throttling or controlling of the speed
        of rotation of the hydraulic motors located within the wheels of
        the vehicle. A hydraulic actuating unit of standard construction
        is indicated at 108, Figure 1. This actuator receives hydraulic
        fluid from the independent supply tank 98 and forces the same
        through the piping 109 into the throttle control valve 73,
        Figure 3, by way of the pipe 109. This pressure forces the
        piston 111 and the tapered throttle valve 112, Figure 3, in the
        direction of the arrow against the pressure spring 113,
        graduating the flow of high pressure hydraulic fluid from the
        gas motor 8 through the supply pipe 72 and into the valve
        chamber 114, Figure 3, from where it leaves by way of the pipe
        74 to the motor 35, Figure 1. The piston 111 and valve 112,
        Figure 3, are balanced when pressure exists within the chamber
        114. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the operation of our braking system
        relative to our new and improved motor vehicle. Referring to
        Figures 1 and 19, hydraulic fluid is delivered by way of the
        pipe 116 to the fluid actuator 117 of standard construction,
        which delivers fluid under pressure through the line 118 to the
        brake throttling metering valve 119. The brake throttling valve
        is built into the valve housing 91, Figure 11, looking in the
        direction of line 19-19. Pressure is applied to the floating
        piston 120 formed with a tapered portion 121, forcing the piston
        120 in the direction of the arrow against the spring 122. </p>
      <p>As this piston valve of each wheel motor 35 travels in the
        direction of the arrow, it gradually cuts off the flow of fluid
        flowing through the cylinder space 119 delivered from the rotor
        84, Figures 11 and 12, by way of the port 76 thereby restricting
        the flow of fluid, retarding the rotation of the rotor. As the
        said flow is restricted the motor is converted into a pump
        applying a resistance to the rotation of the wheel, the amount
        of resistance depending upon the upon the position of the
        tapered portion 121 of the metering valve piston 120,
        restricting the flow of liquid from said rotor to exhaust pipe
        line 77, Figures 1 and 19. </p>
      <p>In the supply lines leading to each wheel motor is located a
        solenoid cut-off valve 74A for cutting off the fluid supply to
        said individual motor. The object of these cut-off valves is to
        stop the flow of fluid to any wheel that may be spinning for the
        lack of traction, thereby delivering full power to the wheels
        having traction. These solenoid cut-off valves are push button
        controlled by the switch 74B located at a place convenient to
        the operator. </p>
      <p>We will now describe what happened when the vehicle is coasting
        requiring no driving power. The throttle control valve 73,
        Figures 1 and 3, is closed by the release of the throttle
        control actuator 108. This creates a fluid block against the
        hydraulic pump pistons 67, Figures 1 and 5, which overcomes the
        pressure of the gas being applied to the piston 19, Figure 5,
        therefore the piston assembly will come to rest, due to the
        closing of the throttle 73. The pumping action created within
        the motors 35 by the coasting of the vehicle pumps fluid from
        the motors through the piping 77, through the open emergency
        brake control valve 78 through the hydraulic heat exchanger 18
        bypassing the reservoir 68 and the hydraulic pump 66-67 by way
        of the check valve 123 into the line 74, leading back to the
        motors 35. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the operation of the emergency brake. The
        emergency brake valve 78 is merely brought to closed position
        blocking the circulation of the oil from the motors through the
        above-described liquid circuit. In order to prevent abrupt
        stopping of the rotation of the wheels causing a skid, an
        adjustable bypass relief valve 79 releases the initial heavy
        pressure developed by the liquid circulating within the line,
        gradually applying the emergency brake, bringing the car to a
        stop and holding the same in a stationary condition. </p>
      <p>In case of the failure of the above-described braking system an
        auxiliary brake, preferably mechanical, may be applied through
        the brake drum 124, Figure 1. This brake drum is directly
        connected to the shaft of the motor 35 of the rear wheels. </p>
      <p>In the operation of our new and improved gas and hydraulic
        operated vehicle, it is a well-known fact that heat will be
        developed within the hydraulic circuit due to hydrodynamic
        characteristics, therefore the hydraulic fluid is passed through
        the tubes 18A of the heat exchanger 18, Figure 1. These tubes
        are cooled by the fan 17 driven by the gas motor 12. </p>
      <p>The gas driven motor 12 drives the fans 14 and 1, Figure 1. The
        construction of the gas motor 12 is similar to the hydraulic
        motor 35, Figure 11, excepting the valves. This motor 12 rotates
        in one direction only. The revolution per minute depends on the
        volume of the gas flowing through it, which is in direct
        relation to the amount of gas required to propel the vehicle.
        The speed of the motor 12 is independent of the speed of the
        wheel motor 35, because when climbing a hill more gas pressure
        in the converter 8 is required to propel the vehicle than when
        traveling on level terrain. Consequently more gas will pass
        through the motor 12 and into the condenser 1, which will
        require a greater volume of air for cooling. The speed of the
        motor 12 is directly proportional to the volume of gas flowing
        through it, which is directly proportional to condensing
        requirements within the condenser 1, thus becoming automatic in
        speed control. </p>
      <p>Air within the vehicle is conditioned by refrigerant coils 125,
        Figure 1. Liquid refrigerant is circulated from the bottom of
        the condenser 1 through the pipe 125 and the usual expansion
        valve 127. </p>
      <p>The evaporated gas within the coils 125 is compressed by the
        compressor 128 so that it will be in the form of high pressure
        gas and delivered through the line 129 into the condenser 1,
        completing its refrigerating cycle. The coils 125 are located
        within a housing 130 from where the cooled air is drawn off and
        distributed within the vehicle by the conventional blower fan
        131. The temperature within the vehicle is automatically
        controlled by the thermostat 125A and control switch 125B. </p>
      <p>We will now describe the operation of out hydro-gas power
        system in operating a vehicle. Referring to Figure 1, the first
        step is to close the electric switch 132. This starts the oil
        burner motors 6, which will have an automatic lighter,
        delivering electric energy from the battery 16A and the motor 2A
        which will start driving the pump withdrawing refrigerant from
        the condenser 1, delivering the same into the generator 4. When
        the pressure within the condenser 1 returns to normal or low,
        the switch 135 will be opened, thereby stopping the pump 2. </p>
      <p>When the gas has been brought to the proper pressure for
        operating the vehicle, the switch 33 is closed starting the
        motor 31, which in turn drives the cam shaft 28 within the gas
        motor 8, referring to Figures 1, 4, 5, and 6. This shaft is
        revolved all the time that the motor vehicle is being used
        either standing or moving. </p>
      <p>We will now describe how the vehicle is set in forward motion.
        Referring to Figure 5, when the vehicle is standing still,
        either before or after the cam shaft 28 is revolved, the push
        rod 30 will be adjusted by lever 59 in a straight line between
        the pivot point 54 of the rocker arm 29 and the valve lifter 26
        so that when the rocker arm is being rocked by the cam 28, it
        will have no effect on the opening of the valve 24 and no gas
        will be admitted into the passages 22 and 45. </p>
      <p>Referring to Figure 1, the lever 59 would be in the position
        indicated by the broken line 59A. In order to move the vehicle
        forward the lever 59 is moved in the direction of the arrow for
        normal cruising speeds, but on hills it will be towards the
        broken line position 59B. As stated above in our description of
        the gas motor 8, Figure 5, the further that the push rod 30
        moves away from the pivot point 54, the greater will be the
        opening of the valve 24 permitting a greater volume of gas into
        the cylinder 39 from the passages 22 and 45 for operating the
        piston 19. </p>
      <p>When the gas enters into the cylinder 39 it forces the piston
        19 in the direction of the arrow as above described, causing the
        piston 67 to force hydraulic fluid out through the valve 71 and
        the pipe 72 through the throttling control valve 73, Figures 1
        and 3, pipe line 74, Figure 1, into the motor 35. </p>
      <p>As described previously there is a motor on each of the wheels,
        all wheels being driven independently. As described previously
        the throttle valve 73 is operated by the actuator 108, which
        will permit the desired amount of hydraulic fluid being
        delivered by the hydraulic pump 66-67 to the motors 35 thereby
        controlling the speed of the vehicle. </p>
      <p>When the flow of the hydraulic fluid is resisted, it provides
        sufficient back pressure against the piston 67 of the hydraulic
        pump, Figure 5, to overcome the pressures developed by the gas
        pressure from the gas generator 4 in gas motor 8, Figures 1 and
        2, even though the cam shaft 28 continues to open the valve 24
        beyond the requirements. When the vehicle is coasting the
        control valve 73 is entirely closed, closing the flow of the
        hydraulic fluid completely off and providing a complete stoppage
        of the movement of the pistons 67 and 19, but at the same time
        this happens the motors 35 become pumps, circulating the fluid
        through the line 77, heat exchanger 18, past the check valve
        123, back into the line 74, into the motors and as above
        described. This flow may be stopped by the emergency brake 78,
        or by the foot operated brake actuator 117, which causes the
        taper 121 of the piston 120 to cover the opening 76, Figure 19,
        connecting line 77, thereby applying the brake by putting a
        resistance against the rotation of the rotor 84, Figure 17,
        opposite to the pressure indicated by the arrows. </p>
      <p>When it is desired to reverse the direction of the motor 35 and
        operate the vehicle in the opposite direction, the control lever
        100, Figure 1, is moved to the position indicated by the broken
        line 100B. This revolves the valve 92, Figure 11, to its reverse
        running position as indicated in Figure 18 and by the arrow in
        Figure 20. When the lever 100 is in the neutral position shown
        in Figure 1, the valve 92 is in neutral position within the
        motor and will resist all flow of fluid through the motor ports.
      </p>
      <p>In order to prevent the lever 100 from being moved into the
        neutral position from the running position while the vehicle is
        moving in either the forward or reverse direction, a safety lock
        is provided, which will prevent the change of lever 100 from
        position 100A or 100B while the vehicle is still in motion. </p>
