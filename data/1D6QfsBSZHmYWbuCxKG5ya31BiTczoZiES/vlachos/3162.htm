      <p>According to the broad aspects of the present invention, there
        is provided a novel fluid flow device suitable for use either as
        a pump or motor comprising a casing having a chamber for
        receiving a rotor therein to provide at least one pump chamber.
        Each pump chamber is provided with suitable intake and discharge
        ports which communicate with the inlet and outlet ports of the
        casing. The rotor is provided with a plurality of slidable vanes
        which force fluid from the inlet port to the discharge port in
        the conventional manner. Means are provided for bypassing a
        preselected amount of fluid from the pump chamber to the back
        side of the vanes to urge them into positive sealing engagement
        with the wall of the chamber. Control means further are provided
        for regulating the amount of fluid bypassed to the back side of
        the reciprocating vanes to vary the amount of sealing pressure
        thereof and accordingly, the volume and pressure of the fluid
        output. </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings, there is shown the preferred
        embodiment of the invention comprising a suitable casing 10
        having a front face 11, a rear face 12, a cylindrical socket 13
        in the front face and an axially aligned cylindrical opening 14
        having a smaller diameter than the socket 13 extending from the
        socket 13 to the rear face of the casing to provide an annular
        shoulder 15. The casing is also provided with a suitable inlet
        port 16 and an outlet port 17 which communicates with the
        cylindrical socket 13. </p>
      <p>Received in the socket 13 of the casing is a cylindrical liner
        18, the rear face 19 of which abuts the annular shoulder 15 and
        the front face 20 of which lies substantially flush with the
        front face 11 of the casing. Formed in the liner 18 is an oblong
        chamber 21 which is adapted to receive a centrally disposed
        cylindrical rotor 22 mounted on a shaft 23 to provide a pair of
        opposed chambers 24 and 25. Formed in the cylindrical surface
        18a of the liner is an arcuate recess 26 which registers with
        arcuate recess 27 formed in the cylindrical surface 13a of the
        socket 13 to provided an arcuate fluid intake passageway
        28.&nbsp; As best shown in Figure 3, the intake passageway 28
        communicates with the inlet port 16 in the casing and intake
        ports 29 and 30 in the liner which are diametrically opposed
        relative to the axis of the rotor shaft and which provide for
        the entry of te fluid into pump chambers 24 and 25 respectively.
      </p>
      <p>Also formed in the cylindrical surface 18a of the liner is
        arcuate recess 31 which registers with arcuate recess 32 formed
        in the cylindrical surface 13a of the socket 13 to provide
        arcuate fluid discharge passageway 33. As best shown in Figure
        2, arcuate fluid discharge passageway 3 communicates with the
        outlet port 17 of the casing and discharge ports 34 and 35 which
        are diametrically opposed relative to the rotor shaft and which
        provides for discharge of the fluid from the pump chambers 24
        and 25, respectively. </p>
      <p>Provided in the casing 10 is a fluid drain passageway 67 which
        communicates with the bottom portions of fluid intake passageway
        28 and fluid discharge passageway 33. A suitable drain valve 68
        further is provided for draining the fluid from the device. </p>
      <p>The axially aligned cylindrical opening 14 in the casing is
        adapted to receive a cylindrical closure cap member 36 which is
        rotatably mounted therein. Referring particularly to Figures 1,
        4, and 5, the front face 37 of the closure cap abuts the rear
        face 20a of the liner to provide an end wall for pump chambers
        24 and 25 and is retained therein by means of a retainer ring 38
        which is disposed in an annular groove 39 in the opening 14 of
        the casing. An O-ring seal 40 is also provided in annular rove
        41 in the opening 14. </p>
      <p>The front face of the closure cap is provided with an axially
        disposed cylindrical recess 42 having the same diameter as the
        rotor. Formed in the bottom face of the cylindrical recess 42 is
        a diametrical groove 43, the ends of which terminate in
        longitudinally extending grooves 44 and 45 in the cylindrical
        surface 46 of the recess 42. Seated in the recess 42 and having
        a thickness less than the depth of the recess is a bearing 47
        made of Teflon or any other suitable material. The bearing 47
        has an axial opening 48 which opens into the diametrical groove
        43 to provide substantially an E-shaped fluid passageway as
        shown in figure 1. The front surface of the casing is closed by
        an end cap 49 which is secured to the casing by means of a
        plurality of circumferentially spaced suitable bolts 50. </p>
      <p>The rotor 25 is mounted on the reduced portion 23a of the shaft
        23 and is provided with an integral end plate member 51 also
        mounted on the reduced portion 23a of the shaft. The end plate
        51 is received in the recess 42 in the closure cap 36 and abuts
        the front face of the bearing 47. The end plate 51 also has a
        hub portion 52 which is journaled in the axial opening 48 of the
        bearing 47, and a V-shaped groove 51a extending about the
        cylindrical surface thereof in communication with the
        longitudinally extending grooves 44 and 45 in the closure cap
        for lubricating and cooling the end plate member. Mounted on the
        shaft 23 at the opposite end of the rotor is an end plate 53
        which is received in a cylindrical recess 54 in the end cap 49
        abutting a bearing 55 made of Teflon or any other suitable
        material. The cylindrical surface of the end plate 53 is
        provided with a groove 53a which communicates with the pump
        chambers for lubricating and cooling the end plate 53. The shaft
        23 is journaled in the axial opening in the bearing 55 and
        extends to the exterior through an axial opening 56 in the end
        cap 49. As shown in Figure 1, the opening 56 in the end cap is
        enlarged at its end to accommodate the conventional packing
        rings 57. A locking nut 58 is provided for retaining the packing
        rings in sealing engagement with the shaft. </p>
      <p>As best shown in Figures 2 and 3, the rotor 23 is provided with
        a plurality of radial slots 59 which receive slidable vanes 60,
        preferably made of Teflon. The vanes are adapted to slide
        radially in the slots and to engage and follow the contour of
        the surface of the oblong chamber in the liner. Also, the
        reduced portion 23a of the shaft has an axial bore 61
        communicating with the bottom of each slot by means of a
        plurality of radial passageways 62 in the shaft. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated in reference to Figures 1 and 4, that a
        predetermined amount of fluid may be bypassed from the pump
        chambers 24 and 25 through the longitudinal grooves 44 and 45
        and the groove 43 in the closure cap, the axial bore 61 in the
        reduced shaft portion 23a and through radial passageways 62 into
        the slots 59 to urge the vanes into sealing engagement with the
        ump chamber walls subject to a range of pressured depending upon
        the orientation of the closure cap 36. As noted particularly in
        Figures 1 and 4, the radial distance from the axis of the device
        to the bottoms of the openings 44a and 45a in the front face 37
        of the cap member formed by the grooves 44 and 45 and the end
        plate 51 is substantially equal to the radius of the rotor. Also
        the radial distance from the axis of the device to the top of
        the openings 44a and 45a is substantially equal to the maximum
        radial distance from the axis of the device to the
        longitudinally extending surface 21a of the oblong chamber 21.
        Accordingly, when the closure cap is in the position as shown in
        Figure 4, the rear face 20a of the liner will block openings 44a
        and 45a in the front face 37 thereof thus preventing any
        bypassing of the fluid. However, as the closure cap is rotated
        either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to a maximum
        orientation of 90 degrees relative to the vertical as shown in
        broken lines in Figure 4, the amount of bypassing fluid is
        accordingly increased to a maximum. The range of volume and
        pressure of the liquid can thus be varied by rotating the
        closure cap within a 90 degree range. </p>
      <p>In operating the present fluid flow device as a pump, drive is
        applied to the shaft in either direction and fluid is drawn
        through the inlet port of the casing, through intake passageway
        28 and into pump chambers 24 and 25 by means of intake ports 29
        and 30 in the liner. The extended vanes 60 then force the fluid
        toward discharge passageway 33 and out through outlet port 17.
        Depending upon the orientation of the closure cap 367, a minute
        portion of the fluid will be bypassed through the openings 44a
        and 45a, diametrical groove 43, axial bore 61, radial
        passageways 62 and into the slots 59 to urge the vanes into
        positive sealing engagement with the pump chamber walls. With
        the closure cap orientated as shown in Figure 4, no fluid will
        be bypassed and accordingly the volume and pressure of the fluid
        will be at a minimum. As the closure cap is rotated by means of
        a suitable handle 63 to a maximum of 90 degrees from the
        vertical, as illustrated b y the dotted lines in Figure 4, a
        proportionately greater amount of fluid will be bypassed to the
        back side of the vanes providing an increased sealing pressure
        and accordingly an increased volume and pressure. It will be
        obvious that the present fluid flow device can be employed as a
        motor by utilizing the fluid as the motivating means. </p>
      <p>It will be appreciated that the present fluid flow device
        utilizes the motivated or motivating fluid as a means for urging
        the vanes into sealing engagement with the pump chamber thus
        permitting the vanes to balance themselves and, accordingly, the
        rotor to seek its own center of gyration. Furthermore, as
        preferably Teflon vanes and bearings are used, over a period of
        use, the parts of the device wear into rather than out of
        operative engagement. It will further be appreciated that in
        utilizing a fluid flow device having a dual pump chamber with
        positive sealing of the reciprocating vanes, a linear,
        non-pulsating fluid flow is provided. </p>
      <p>Another advantageous feature of the present invention is the
        relatively few number of parts which can be easily assembled and
        disassembled. To assemble the preferred embodiment of the
        present invention as described, the liner is first inserted into
        the socket of the casing and adjusted into position so that the
        arcuate grooves 26 and 32 register with arcuate grooves 27 and
        31, respectively, to provide intake passageway 28 and discharge
        passageway 33. The closure cap 36, with O-ring 40 in place, is
        inserted into the opening 14 and retained therein by means of
        the retainer ring 38. Next, the rotor mounted on the shaft with
        end plates 51 and 53 is inserted into the pump chamber so that
        the hub portion 52 is journaled in the Teflon bearing 47 and the
        end plate is received in the recess 42 in the closure cap and
        the rotor with the vanes retracted rests temporarily on the
        chamber wall. The end cap 49 is then mounted on the front face
        of the casing and secured thereto by the bolts 50 to that the
        shaft 23 will be journaled in Teflon bearing 55 and extend out
        through the axial opening 56 in the end cap. The end plate 53
        also is received in recess 54, Finally, the packing rings are
        mounted on the shaft and the locking nut is applied to compress
        the rings into sealing engagement about the shaft. </p>
      <p>In Figure 6 there is shown an end view of an alternate rotor 63
        which can be used with the present invention to provide even
        higher pressures than available from the use of the rotor shown
        in Figures 1-3. The rotor 63 is provided&nbsp; with an axial
        fluid passageway 64, a plurality of spaced vane slots 65 being
        disposed at an angle to the radius of the rotor and a plurality
        of fluid passageways 66 communicating the axial passageway 64
        with the bottoms of the vane slots 65. Suitable slidable vanes
        are provided in the slots which are urged against the wall of
        the pump chamber in the same manner as described in connection
        with the above mentioned embodiment. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing detailed description, it will be evident
        that there are a number of changes, adaptations and modification
        of the present invention which come within the province of those
        skilled in the art. However, it is to be understood that it is
        intended that all such variations not departing from the spirit
        of the invention, be considered as within the scope thereof as
        limited solely by the appended claims. </p>
