      <div align="center"><big><b>Scientists create eye drop that
            dissolves cataracts with naturally occurring chemical</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Getting rid of cataracts normally means surgery to remove them.
      But researchers have discovered that a naturally occurring
      chemical in the human body may dissolve the blinding cloudiness
      when used as an eye drop.<br>
      <br>
      Cataracts ? or a clouding of the eye lens ? are caused by proteins
      clumping together blurring their victims’ vision and, if left
      untreated, eventually leading to blindness, according to the
      National Eye Institute (NEI). They affect 17 percent of Americans
      age 40 and older and more than half of those age 80 and older.
      Worldwide, tens of millions of people are affected, making
      cataracts the leading cause of blindness. Cataracts are initially
      treated with new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare
      sunglasses or magnifying glasses.<br>
      <br>
      “If these measures do not help, surgery is the only effective
      treatment,” NEI notes. “Surgery involves removing the cloudy lens
      and replacing it with an artificial lens.”<br>
      <br>
      But Dr. Kang Zhang, a professor of ophthalmology at the University
      of California, San Diego (UCSD), thinks he may have found a
      different solution. His research has focused on lanosterol, a
      naturally occurring steroid that the human body already produces.

      <br>
      But Dr. Kang Zhang, a professor of ophthalmology at the University
      of California, San Diego (UCSD), thinks he may have found a
      different solution. His research has focused on lanosterol, a
      naturally occurring steroid that the human body already produces.
      <br>
      <br>
      He and his team at UCSD’s Shiley Eye Institute studied two Chinese
      families in which the children had congenital cataracts, meaning
      that they were the result of a genetic defect, rather than
      age-related. They found that the kids with the congenital version
      had two copies of a mutation in the gene that produces lanosterol,
      but their parents did not have the same mutation. Normally, the
      gene produces the steroid, which prevents the cataract-causing
      proteins from clumping together. But the mutation caused an
      abnormality in the lanosterol, which allowed the cataracts to
      form.<br>
      <br>
      “By screening families across the world for mutations that affect
      vision, we found four kids in two families with genetic
      aberrations in an enzyme called lanosterol synthase,” said Zhang,
      according to PBS ‘Newshour’.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers concluded that the steroid had a connection with
      the appearance of cataracts ? or the lack thereof. They then
      created an eye drop that contains lanosterol, which they first
      tested on rabbits that had cataracts. To test the drops, the
      scientists isolated the cloudy lenses from the animals and placed
      them in a lanosterol solution for six days.<br>
      <br>
      The rabbits’ lenses became clearer and the severity of the
      cataracts were reduced after treatment, Zhang’s team found. The
      lanosterol solution had an effect on 11 of the 13 animals.<br>
      <br>
      “We went on to test the effect of the eye drops in dogs with
      cataracts. We gave them eye drops twice a day for six weeks and
      found it had reduced the effect of cataract severity,” Zhang told
      IFLScience.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers used seven dogs from breeds that are naturally
      prone to cataracts, including black Labrador retrievers,
      Queensland heelers, and miniature pinschers. Of the seven, three
      dogs' vision was cleared by the eye drops, while the other four
      showed improvement after six weeks of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      “We saw an increase in the lens transparency and also decreased
      cloudiness of the cataract,” Zhang said.<br>
      <br>
      Because the study only lasted for a few months, the cataracts are
      likely to redevelop, he told IFLScience.<br>
      <br>
      Zhang’s next step is to figure out exactly how the eye drops work
      to dissolve cataracts, and then to begin human trials, Digital
      Journal reported.<br>
      <br>
      Ophthalmologists not involved with the study said that the eye
      drops could become an extremely important tool in battling
      cataracts.<br>
      <br>
      "It would have a huge public health impact," Dr. Robert B.
      Bhisitkul, a professor of ophthalmology at the UC San Francisco
      School of Medicine and who was not involved in the research, told
      the Los Angeles Times. "Preventing or reversing cataracts with an
      eye drop has been the Holy Grail in ophthalmology since the field
      began."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Manuel Datiles, a senior investigator and attending
      ophthalmologist at NEI, which is part of the National Institutes
      of Health ? expressed cautious optimism at how the lanosterol
      solution might change the field, but warned that the drops won’t
      be able to replace surgery, at least not immediately.<br>
      <br>
      “You cannot compare the improvements shown in this study with
      surgery. With cataract surgery, you become 20 years old again;
      with this one the lens is cleared up, but your vision can still be
      murky,” he told IFLScience.<br>
      <br>
      He added that lanosterol isn’t the only way that researchers are
      trying to alleviate cataracts.<br>
      <br>
      “There are other drops that do the same thing but use different
      pathways. This is why we need multifunctional anti-cataract agents
      that work together across multiple pathways to clear the lens,”
      Datiles said. “There’s now scope to investigate how we can combine
      this drug with other ones to better improve treatment.”<br>
      <br>
      Zhang’s results were published in the journal Nature.<br>

      The human lens is comprised largely of crystallin proteins
      assembled into a highly ordered, interactive macro-structure
      essential for lens transparency and refractive index. Any
      disruption of intra- or inter-protein interactions will alter this
      delicate structure, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, with consequent
      protein aggregation and cataract formation. Cataracts are the most
      common cause of blindness worldwide, affecting tens of millions of
      people1, and currently the only treatment is surgical removal of
      cataractous lenses. The precise mechanisms by which lens proteins
      both prevent aggregation and maintain lens transparency are
      largely unknown. Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in
      the lens. It is synthesized by lanosterol synthase (LSS) in a key
      cyclization reaction of a cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we
      identify two distinct homozygous LSS missense mutations (W581R and
      G588S) in two families with extensive congenital cataracts. Both
      of these mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues and
      impair key catalytic functions of LSS. Engineered expression of
      wild-type, but not mutant, LSS prevents intracellular protein
      aggregation of various cataract-causing mutant crystallins.
      Treatment by lanosterol, but not cholesterol, significantly
      decreased preformed protein aggregates both in vitro and in
      cell-transfection experiments. We further show that lanosterol
      treatment could reduce cataract severity and increase transparency
      in dissected rabbit cataractous lenses in vitro and cataract
      severity in vivo in dogs. Our study identifies lanosterol as a key
      molecule in the prevention of lens protein aggregation and points
      to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment.<br>

      In coming decades, doctors might be able to treat or prevent
      cataracts with eyedrops -- all because of an unexpected discovery,
      revealed during a genetics study, about a molecule that helps make
      cholesterol in human cells.<br>
      <br>
      Lanosterol, as the substance is known, can reverse the
      accumulation of proteins in the lens of the eye that appear to
      cause cataracts, UC San Diego researcher Dr. Kang Zhang and
      colleagues discovered.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the team's work were published Wednesday in the
      journal Nature, and may hold promise for the tens of millions of
      people around the world who suffer from cataracts. Currently, the
      disease is treatable only through surgical removal of the lens.
      But potentially, thanks to the lanosterol discovery, patients
      might someday be able to prevent or treat the disease by using
      eyedrops or getting an injection -- avoiding the risks, discomfort
      and costs of surgery and recovery.<br>
      <br>
      "It would have a huge public health impact," said Dr. Robert B.
      Bhisitkul, a professor of ophthalmology at the UC San Francisco
      School of Medicine who was not involved in the research. <br>
      "Preventing or reversing cataracts with an eyedrop has been the
      Holy Grail in ophthalmology since the field began."<br>
      <br>
      Zhang, who is well known for his research on retinal diseases, had
      no idea that he'd be investigating lanosterol as part of the
      study.<br>
      <br>
      "It was a surprise," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Preventing or reversing cataracts with an eyedrop has been the
      Holy Grail in ophthalmology since the field began. - Dr. Robert B.
      Bhisitkul, UC San Francisco ophthalmologist<br>
      <br>
      The work began as an investigation of the genetics in a single
      family in which two parents without cataracts, who happened to be
      first cousins, had four children: three with cataracts and one
      without. <br>
      <br>
      Sequencing and analyzing the genomes of the parents and the
      children, Zhang and his team were able to zero in on a likely
      cause of the diseased kids' cataracts -- each had two copies of a
      mutated version of a gene called LSS, which was known to be
      involved in the production of lanosterol. (The researchers later
      found a second family with cataracts that also had a mutation in
      the LSS gene.)<br>
      <br>
      To see if a problem producing lanosterol was involved in causing
      cataracts somehow, the researchers conducted a number of tests,
      introducing various types of cataract-like crystalline protein
      mutations into human lens cells in lab dishes and seeing whether
      adding lanosterol would clear them away. It did.<br>
      <br>
      The team also administered the lanosterol to naturally occurring
      cataracts in rabbit lenses that had been incubated in lab dishes.
      That, too, increased the clarity of the lens. Last, the
      researchers treated dogs with naturally occurring cataracts with a
      shot of lanosterol in the eye, followed by eyedrops twice a day
      for six weeks. Again, lens clarity improved.<br>
      <br>
      Khang said that the team next would prepare for human trials, and
      that he expected toxic effects of lanosterol to be "minimal,"
      since the substance is already produced by the human body.
      Bhisitkul said that treatments woudn't be available until far in
      the future, but that he thought the greatest opportunity might lie
      in prevention -- that patients might start using an eyedrop when
      they're in late middle age, for instance, to prevent cataract
      formation later on.<br>
      <br>
      In an editorial published alongside the study in Nature, J.
      Fielding Hejtmancik of the Ophthalmic Genetics and Visual Function
      Branch of the National Eye Institute in Rockville, Md., who was
      not involved in the study, noted that the world's aging population
      has been predicted to double the need for cataract surgeries over
      the next 20 years -- making the possibility of a drug-based
      alternative especially attractive.<br>
      <br>
      "The potential for this finding to be translated into the first
      practical pharmacological prevention, or even treatment, of human
      cataracts could not come at a more opportune time," he wrote.<br>

      The invention relates to a method for separating and extracting
      cholesterol in lanolin alcohol, which comprises the following
      steps: carrying out molecular distillation on lanolin alcohol,
      collecting the light-phase fraction which is refined lanolin
      alcohol, heating the refined lanolin alcohol in a mixed solvent of
      methanol and acetone until the refined lanolin alcohol is
      completely dissolved, and cooling to cooling temperature, wherein
      the remainder of the filtrate after reduced pressure distillation
      is the primary concentrate of cholesterol; heating to dissolve the
      primary concentrate of cholesterol in acetone, cooling to
      precipitate, filtering, and carrying out reduced pressure
      distillation on the filtrate to recover the solvent, wherein the
      balance is the secondary concentrate of cholesterol; heating to
      dissolve the secondary concentrate of cholesterol in an alcohol
      solvent, cooling to cooling temperature, keeping the temperature
      for 6-12 hours, and vacuum-filtering to obtain the white acerose
      cholesterol crude product; and recrystallizing the cholesterol
      crude product through a methanol-acetone mixed solvent to obtain
      the refined cholesterol product. The refined cholesterol product
      selectively recrystallizes through the solvent to obtain the
      byproduct lanosterol accounting for 63-70% and the cholesterol
      product of which the purity is more than 90%.<br>

      </b>FIELD: medicinal industry, sterols. ^ SUBSTANCE: invention
      relates, in particular, to the improved method for producing
      sterols - lanosterol and cholesterol from wooly fat that can be
      used in preparing medicinal and cosmetic preparations. Method is
      carried out by alkaline hydrolysis of raw, extraction of
      unsaponifiable substances, removal of solvent and successive
      isolation of lanosterol and cholesterol. Alkaline hydrolysis of
      raw is carried out with a mixture of ethanol, sodium hydroxide,
      pyrogallol and water at temperature 70 DEG C for 4 h at stirring
      in the following ratio of components: raw : ethanol : sodium
      hydroxide : pyrogallol : water =
      100.0:(300.0-350.0):(30.0-35.0):(0.01-0.05):(7.5-12.0),
      respectively, with the indicated mixture with addition of toluene
      in the following ratio: raw : ethanol : sodium hydroxide :
      pyrogallol : toluene : water =
      100.0:(220.0-255.0):(30.0-38.0):(0.05-0.12):(100.0-137.0):(2.5-7.0),
      respectively, and lanosterol is isolated by precipitation from
      mixture of methylene chloride and ethanol in the ratio = 1:1.
      Before removal of solvent unsaponifiable substances are extracted
      at temperature 50 DEG C for 2-3 h at stirring. Invention provides
      increasing yield of the end product, enhancing qualitative indices
      and reducing cost of production. ^ EFFECT: improved producing
      method.<br>
