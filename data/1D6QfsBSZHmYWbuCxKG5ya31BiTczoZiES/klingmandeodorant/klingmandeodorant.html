          &nbsp;Shannon Klingman, MD is a gynecologist and she realizes
          the importance of empowering women to discretely address odor
          concerns. In today’s episode, we hear how Dr. Klingman was
          tired of the narrative of “vaginal odor” that has been told
          since the beginning of time. She also discusses with us how
          there is an industry of products currently on the market that
          misleads women into believing that all vaginas have a foul
          odor as if it is an inevitable reality for women. Odor. It
          happens. But now there is a product that can fight it.<br>
          <br>
          In today’s episode, we will explore how Shannon Klingman, MD,
          an OB-GYN from Minnetonka, Minnesota, came up with a new
          product that all women have been asking for. A deodorant for
          ALL of your parts. And I mean ALL of them. She invented,
          produces, markets and distributes Lume Deodorant. <br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] This invention pertains to products and methods for
      personal care and odor control, particularly for reducing or
      preventing unwanted odor from the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Fishy odors from the pudendal region or genitalia of the
      female body have long been a source of annoyance and embarrassment
      to adult and teenaged women. Women seeking help from physicians
      are frequently given antibiotics such as metronidazole, based on
      the long-standing belief that vaginal bacteria are the cause of
      the problem. Indeed, a fishy odor is commonly considered to be a
      symptom for bacterial vaginosis (see, for example, “Bacterial
      Vaginosis,” Wikipedia,
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis, accessed Nov.
      17, 2009). Others seeking relief have tried a variety of products
      such as douches which may provide only short-term decrease in the
      odor (if the vagina was the actual source of the odor). In spite
      of many medications and feminine hygiene products, there has been
      a long-standing unmet need in this area, fueled by lack of
      understanding about the causes and the nature of the problem,
      especially the assumption that fishy odor only arises from the
      vagina due to bacterial imbalance or infectious cause such as
      bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The “Whiff test” for vaginosis involves treating body
      fluids with potassium hydroxide (KOH). A resulting fishy odor
      produced by an amine reaction is taken as an indicator for the
      presence of anaerobic bacteria. However, the amine reaction or
      related reactions that result in a fishy odor can take place
      without addition of KOH, but under other elevated pH conditions on
      the pudendum. The materials serving as a source for the
      nitrogen-containing compounds released as fishy odor (e.g.,
      trimethylamine) can include semen, blood, urine, cervical mucus
      and post menopausal physiologic discharge. When these are brought
      in contact with the anaerobic bacteria from the rectum, an
      unpleasant fishy odor will result. The odor is known to be
      associated with reactions from bacteria, but the historic focus on
      bacteria in the vagina and the assumption that vaginitis or more
      specifically, bacterial vaginosis, is the cause of the odor may
      have misled many in seeking for solutions that treat bacteria in
      the vagina.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] We have found that for many women, the source of the odor
      is more commonly from the pudendum (including the intergluteal
      folds and external genitalia), where anaerobic bacteria from the
      lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract or other sources can be found.
      These anaerobic bacteria may be especially present on the external
      skin around the perianal anatomy.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The new recognition that vaginal bacteria are not cause of
      fishy odor in many women is of special significance, and helps
      explain why antibiotic treatments and other standard treatments
      have fared so poorly in treating many cases of fishy odor, and why
      may women presenting symptoms of fishy odor do not actually have
      bacterial vaginosis when thorough testing is conducted (see, for
      example, N. K. Lowe et al., “Accuracy of the Clinical Diagnosis of
      Vaginitis Compared With a DNA Probe Laboratory Standard,”
      Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, vol. 113, no. 1, January 2009, pp
      89-95, abstract available online at
      http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2009/01000/Accuracy_of_the_Clinical_Diagnosis_of_Vaginitis.15.aspx



      and Hope K. Haefner, “Conquering Resistant Vulvovaginitis,” 2007,
      presentation available online at
      http://www.yellowdocuments.com/12180308-advancements-in-benign-vulvar-and).



      It also points to the long unmet need for improved means of
      reducing or preventing fishy odor by better controlling the
      activity of anaerobic bacteria on the pudendum, particularly those
      interacting with or feeding on nitrogen compounds in body fluids
      such as semen, blood, urine, and feces.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is believed that a particularly significant discovery is
      the recognition that the source of a fishy odor for many women is
      not bacteria in the vagina, nor bacteria coming from the vagina,
      but anaerobic bacteria from non-vaginal sources such as the
      gastrointestinal tract. An understanding of this discovery can be
      enhanced in part by consideration of a rare metabolic disorder,
      trimethylaminuria, a disorder occurring when humans have an
      impaired version of the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3
      (FMO3), which converts trimethylamine to trimethylamine N-oxide
      during the metabolism of some nitrogen-containing compounds such
      as choline or phosphocholine. With impaired FMO3 activity,
      trimethylamine concentrations become elevated and strong fishy
      odor can be generated by the sweat and other body fluids of a
      person, making life difficult and painful. Foods rich in choline
      are especially problematic for those with trimethylaminuria, since
      it leads to production of large amounts of trimethylamine. Without
      wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the release of
      trimethyl amine and possibly other nitrogenous compounds produced
      by anaerobic bacteria at elevated pH on the pudendum of the human
      body is analogous to the production of trimethylamine in the body
      when oxidizing enzymes are impaired in those suffering from
      trimethylaminuria. Again, without wishing to be bound by theory,
      recognition of this analogous condition in light of the newly
      recognized mechanisms for fishy odor generation on the skin of the
      pudendum also suggests that semen may be an especially important
      component in the production of fishy odor in some cases, for
      semen, of all body fluids, may be the richest in choline and is
      among the richest natural sources of choline and water-soluble
      choline compounds, and thus is believed to be a highly significant
      potential source for trimethylamine production by certain
      anaerobic bacteria on the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Thus, we have discovered that the introduction of semen,
      blood, urine, feces, and other body fluids into the pudendum,
      including the perineum and adjacent regions, can raise the pH on
      the skin and provide the nitrogenous materials and alkaline
      conditions for bacterial-assisted production of significant
      amounts of volatile amine compounds such as trimethylamine, giving
      rise to a fishy odor. While the reactions involved may be similar
      to those that occur from bacterial vaginosis, fishy odor can be
      produced on the pudendum under benign conditions. In other words,
      the vagina is not the key factor when trying to solve the problem
      of transient fishy odor for most women.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] For effective prevention of the fishy odor from the amine
      reaction, wiping or washing alone is inadequate. The pH of the
      environment of the perianal bacteria needs to be maintained in an
      acidic state such as at a pH less than about 5.5, or less than
      about 5.3, or less than about 5.1, in order to hinder the amine
      reaction that causes the unwanted fishy odor. 3.5 to 4.2 is the
      normal range of the pH of the vagina, and a pH in this range can
      be suitable for the pH of the pudendum. Thus, a suitable range for
      pH may be, by way of example, from about 3 to about 5.5, from
      about 3.2 to about 5, from about 3.5 to 4.5, or from about 3.5 to
      5.0. Without wishing to be bound by theory, our work indicates
      that the release of the fishy odor can be triggered by an amine
      reaction that occurs when the anaerobic bacteria of the pudendum
      come into contact with alkaline bodily fluids such as semen,
      blood, feces, and other agents such as soap, in essence, giving a
      positive Whiff test on the external genitalia. Possible insight
      into related mechanisms may be found, again without wishing to be
      bound by theory, in the study of Y. Tsuchiya and E. Endo,
      “Enzymatic Reduction of Trimethylamine Oxide,” Tohoku Journal of
      Agricultural Research, 1952, pp. 127-133, available online at
      http://ir.library.tohoku.ac.jp/re/bitstream/10097/29074/1/KJ00000713720.pdf,



      which describes how a bacterial enzyme, triamineoxidase, activates
      relatively odorless trimethylamine oxide and renders it
      susceptible to reduction to the highly malodorous trimethyl amine
      by various dehydrogenases. Several potential inhibitors of the
      reaction are explored. On page 130 of Tsuchiya and Endo, results
      for the reaction rate for trimethylamine production as a function
      of pH shows that a pH above 5.5 such as from about 6 to 8 favors
      high levels of trimethylamine, whereas a pH of 5.5 or less, or 5.0
      or less, favors low levels of trimethylamine.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] An understanding of the importance of maintaining a low pH
      in the external environment of the pudendum relative to the issue
      of controlling fishy odor appears to be lacking in prior attempts
      to deal with fishy odor. For example, some commonly used products
      employ baking soda, an alkaline compound, and a recognition of the
      role of the environment external to the vagina and its pH appears
      to have been lacking in terms of controlling fishy odor.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The compositions and methods proposed herein for
      controlling fishy odor arise in part from the surprising
      realization that the real problem in most cases is not bacteria in
      the vagina, but conditions arising from an anatomically inevitable
      consequence of intercourse, due to semen form intercourse, leaking
      urine, and blood from monthly cycles coming in contact with the
      perianal bacteria that can inhabit various parts of the pudendum.
      The close physical proximity of the vulvar and perianal regions
      contributes to the presence of bacteria that can produce or
      participate in reactions leading to generation of trimethylamine
      or related fishy odor compounds, feeding upon the nitrogenous
      compounds coming from intercourse, urine, menstruation, feces,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] With a realization of the nature of the origin of fishy
      odors due to elevated pH and associated conditions in the
      pudendum, we were able to subsequently develop what is believed to
      be the first product that addresses the real problem (for many
      women) over a prolonged period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Vinegar wipes, douches, and other acidic products have been
      proposed for personal cleansing, but such products have generally
      been developed for rapid cleansing and not for lasting control of
      pH. Thus, even highly acidic vinegar wipes only provide a
      short-term change in pH, as the acidic components is applied and
      then wiped or washed off or otherwise neutralized or quickly
      removed from the skin. With the viscous carrier of many
      embodiments disclosed herein, acidifying components can be
      available for a prolonged period of time to effectively control
      the pH of the environment. Further, with larger molecular weight
      alpha-hydroxy acids disclosed herein (for many embodiments) that
      do not rapidly penetrate the skin, the alpha-hydroxy acids can
      remain on or above the skin to effectively maintain the pH in a
      suitable range for a prolonged period of time, unlike much lighter
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Thus, there is a need for new products and methods that can
      address the surprising discoveries regarding the sources of fishy
      odor in many women, and that can overcome the long-standing unmet
      needs that have not been adequately addressed by previous
      products, formulations, and methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Many retail and prescription products have been marketed
      are directed at treating bacteria in the vagina, which again do
      not address the issue of the external environment in the pudendum.
      Most on the retail side are a cover-up with baking soda and
      perfumes or other ingredients that do not address the problem or
      may even exacerbate it at the true source (albeit the previously
      unrecognized source).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The recognition that the source of the fishy odor is
      frequently from the pudendum and not from the vagina helps
      explain, in retrospect, why treatments based on attacking bacteria
      on the vagina have been relatively ineffective for so many women
      for so long, and may also help explain why misdiagnosis of
      vaginosis is such a common problem (see “Throwing the Dice for the
      Diagnosis of Vaginal Complaints?” by Andreas Schwiertz et al.,
      Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials, Vol. 5. No. 4,
      2006, available online at
      http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/5/1/4). The new
      understanding of the need to provide long-term control of pH on
      the skin of the pudendum also helps explain, in retrospect, why
      previous solutions employing wipes and other means did not provide
      lasting or effective solutions. What is needed, then, is an
      effective system or method for providing a suitable acidic pH over
      a prolonged period of time in the pudendum or portions thereof
      such that the amine reactions giving rise to a fishy odor can be
      impeded, resulting in a significant decrease in the production of
      unpleasant odors.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In spite of the surprising discovery that a major source
      for fishy odor was not from the vagina itself but from the
      external skin of the pudendum, particularly when the pH was
      elevated by the presence of semen, blood, or other materials or
      factors, we found that various efforts to decrease pH were not
      necessarily adequate to provide an acceptable solution, for, among
      other reasons, there is a risk of skin irritation or other
      unwanted responses with prolonged exposure to many acidic
      compounds. For effective treatment of the newly appreciated causes
      of unwanted fish odor for many women, we have also discovered that
      a lasting reduction in fishy odor and associated problems of the
      inevitable chronic presence of anaerobic bacteria in the pudendum
      require new strategies to provide sustained pH control in ways
      that do not irritate the skin. Thus, there is a long-standing need
      to provide sustained pH control in non-irritating means to reduce
      the common problem of fishy odor production from the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A further challenge involves body odors associated with
      perspiration, particularly in the pudendum. Bacteria such as
      Corynebacteria feed off materials in the sweat, particularly the
      apocrine sweat glands, and produce unpleasant odors. Such glands
      tend to be abundant in the groin and pudendal area. Products are
      available such as antiperspirants or deodorants to mask odors or
      reduce perspiration, but products that may be suitable for
      underarm use, for example, may not be safe or effective on the
      pudendum. In particular, the metal-containing compounds such as
      aluminum salts that are widely used for their ability to reduce
      perspiration have been the subject of as-yet unresolved concerns
      about their long-term health effects. Safe, effective alternatives
      are needed. Given the limitations in currently available products,
      there is a need for deodorants and antiperspirants that are
      effective in preventing perspiration or associated odor on the
      body, particularly on the pudendum, while reducing perceived
      health risks associated with aluminum compounds or other harsh
      chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0021] We have found that relatively non-irritating alpha-hydroxy
      acids such as mandelic acid or combinations of mandelic acid and
      other alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic acid, in combination with
      a suitable carrier such as a protective lipophilic carrier, a
      bioadhesive, or a suitable wipe formulation, can provide
      acidifying agents that are effective in controlling the pH in the
      pudendum while not irritating the skin. By virtue of the acidic
      environment provided by such compositions, the reactions that
      produce fishy odor on the pudendum can be controlled such that the
      odor is substantially reduced or eliminated. In many embodiments,
      the acidifying agents can remain active in the pudendum over a
      prolonged period for lasting odor reduction. Such compositions may
      be applied to the body in a variety of ways, such as by
      application using a pretreated wipe, pad, or absorbent article
      containing the acidifying composition that transfers to the body,
      or by direct application to the body using a spray or other
      dispenser or by application using the fingers or other means to
      apply the composition onto the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Further, we have found that personal care compositions
      comprising caffeine can provide highly effective protection
      against perspiration without the need to use aluminum compounds.
      We have also found that personal care compositions comprising
      caffeine (a methylxanthine) or related xanthines can be used to
      reduce perspiration and/or odor. In several embodiments, the
      xanthine compound is combined with alpha-hydroxy acids such as
      relatively non-irritating mandelic acid to significantly reduce
      body odor in regions of the body such as the underarm region
      normally subject to undesirable odors associated with
      perspiration. Thus, in one embodiment, we have developed a
      personal care composition for reducing at least one of
      perspiration and body odor comprising an effective amount of a
      xanthine compound and at least 0.5% by weight of a carboxylic acid
      in a suitable carrier for application to the skin. In another
      aspect, we have developed an antiperspirant for use on human skin
      comprising about 1% by weight or greater of a xanthine compound in
      a suitable carrier. In yet another aspect, we have developed an
      effective antiperspirant composition comprising at least 1%
      caffeine, at least 1% mandelic acid, at least 5% starch, and
      substantially no aluminum or zirconium compounds. Further, we have
      developed a method of making a substantially aluminum-free
      personal care composition comprising blending caffeine, an
      alpha-hydroxy acid, and a suitable carrier to form a viscous
      composition, and packing the composition in a container with
      indicia associated therewith instructing a user to apply the
      composition to the underarms region or other region of the body
      likely to experience body odor associated with sweat.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In another aspect of the invention, we have developed a
      method for reducing malodor from the pudendum, comprising: (a)
      providing a user with a product comprising an acidifying
      composition having from 0.5% to 10% by weight of mandelic acid or
      salts thereof and from 0.5% to 10% by weight of caffeine or salts
      thereof, said acidifying composition having a pH between 2.8 and 5
      and provided in a viscous carrier suitable for application to the
      skin, and (b) providing directions to the user to apply the
      acidifying composition to the pudendum. Alternatively, the upper
      limit for the caffeine or salts thereof may be 8.3% by weight,
      which corresponds to a mass ratio of the carboxylic acid (mandelic
      acid) to total xanthine (here caffeine or salts thereof) of 1.2
      when the carboxylic acid is mandelic acid at an upper limit of 10%
      by weight. Other possibilities for the mass ratio of carboxylic
      acid to xanthine compounds are discussed hereafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In another aspect of the invention, a method is provided
      for reducing odor from the pudendum a user, comprising: (a)
      preparing a personal care composition for reducing body odor
      comprising from 0.5% to 8.3% by weight of a methylxanthine or
      salts thereof and from 0.5% to 10% by weight of mandelic acid,
      wherein the personal care composition is in the form of a viscous
      compound selected from a cream, a lotion, a paste, or a slurry,
      the personal care composition comprising less than 0.5% by weight
      of zirconium and aluminum antiperspirant compounds; and (b)
      providing the personal care composition in packaging with indicia
      instructing the user to apply the personal care composition to the
      pudendum in order to reduce at least one of malodor and
      perspiration.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In yet another aspect of the invention, a method is
      provided for reducing or preventing malodor from the pudendum,
      comprising: (a) providing a user with a product comprising an
      acidifying composition having at least about 0.5% by weight of
      mandelic acid, at least 0.5% by weight of caffeine or salts
      thereof, said acidifying composition having a pH between about 2.8
      and 5 and being substantially free of trimethylamine, and (b)
      providing directions to the user to apply the acidifying
      composition to the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The discovery that a xanthine compound such as caffeine can
      be effective in reducing malodor from perspiration at the
      concentration claimed herein is surprising, for caffeine is known
      to increase perspiration and is said to increase body odor when
      consumed (see, for example,
      http://www.health911.com/remedies/rem_bodyo.htm, accessed May 28,
      2010,
      http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Stop-Heavy-Perspiration&amp;id=608249
      and http://www.dryidea.com/dryidea/index.cfm?page_id=7 under the
      heading, “MYTH: When I Eat Garlic, My Sweat Smells Like Garlic,”
      both accessed Mar. 30, 2010). Given its apparent role in
      increasing perspiration and body odor, the discovery that caffeine
      can, when properly applied to the body, actually serve to reduce
      body odor and/or to reduce perspiration is counterintuitive. The
      synergy between caffeine and related compounds with carboxylic
      acids such as mandelic acid in reducing body odor from
      perspiration is also highly surprising relative to the state of
      understanding before the advances described herein. However, upon
      discovery of these surprising effects, a theory for the surprising
      efficacy can be proposed with hindsight by consideration of the
      ability of caffeine to restrict blood vessels in the skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Without wishing to be bound by theory, we propose that a
      vaso-restrictive function of caffeine when topically applied helps
      to close pores rather than plugging them (as in certain prior
      antiperspirant products) with the reaction products of metal
      complexes with biological matter. The closing of sweat-releasing
      pores through the action of caffeine is believed to help reduce
      the flow of sweat from sweat glands, thus providing an
      antiperspirant function. Alternatively or in addition, the
      caffeine can act to reduce blood flow to the surface of the skin,
      and it is possible that the reduced blood flow works to reduce
      sweat production from sweat glands. Alternatively, mechanisms that
      reduce blood flow may also work to reduce the supply of
      perspiration available in or deliverable by sweat glands via
      similar mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Caffeine and other vasoconstrictors or chemically related
      compounds may be used in the personal care compositions of the
      present invention, including xanthine derivatives. Caffeine is a
      methylxanthine (a derivative of xanthine having a methyl group).
      Xanthine (3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione), is a purine base found in
      most human body tissues and fluids and in other organisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In forming a personal care composition, the caffeine or
      other xanthines may be provided as a solute in an aqueous
      solution, a non-aqueous solution in combination with an alcohol or
      other liquid, an emulsion, a mixture of encapsulated ingredients
      such as microencapsulated caffeine in combination with ingredients
      in one or more phases, or in other suitable forms. Emulsions, if
      used, can be oil in water emulsions or water in oil emulsions, for
      example. Water-in-water emulsions, such as gel particles in an
      aqueous phase, may also be considered, with the xanthine
      distributed in either or both phases. The caffeine or other
      xanthines may also be provided in solid form, such as in the form
      of a powder. Either solid or solute forms of one or mores
      xanthines may be encapsulated. For example, microcapsules of
      caffeine may be prepared with capsule walls that are at least one
      of (a) water-soluble, (b) fusible (e.g., melting above a
      predetermined temperature such as at about 95° F. or higher), or
      (c) frangible (such that they can break in response to friction to
      release the contained ingredients).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Other xanthines are also believed or known to have
      vasoconstrictive effects relative to the skin or other potentially
      useful effects relative to antiperspirant and deodorant products,
      including pharmacological effects related to those of caffeine,
      and thus xanthines such as methylxanthines and derivatives thereof
      are considered within the scope of certain embodiments of the
      present invention. Methylxanthines include theophylline
      (1,3-dimethyl-7H-purine-2,6-dione, also known as
      dimethylxanthine), caffeine
      (1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione, also known as
      1,3,7-trimethylxanthine or methyltheobromine), and theobromine
      (3,7-dimethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione, also known
      as 3,7-dimethylxanthine or xantheose). Derivatives of xanthine
      compounds including salts thereof may be used, including caffeine
      citrate and other salts with carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In some embodiments, the caffeine or other xanthine
      compound may be present at any effective concentration such as
      about 10% by weight or higher, about 5% by weight or higher, about
      2% by weight or higher, about 1% by weight or higher, or about
      0.5% or higher. For a carboxylic acid such as mandelic acid or a
      mixture of alpha-hydroxy acids, it may be present at any effective
      concentration such as about 10% by weight or higher, about 5% by
      weight or higher, about 2% by weight or higher, or about 1% by
      weight or higher, or about 0.5% or higher. The mass ratio of
      carboxylic acid to total xanthine compounds may be substantially
      zero or any practical finite number such as from about 0.1 to
      about 5.0, from about 0.1 to about 1, from about 0.1 to about 0.5,
      or from about 1 to about 5, or substantially greater than 1 such
      as about 1.2 or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The discovery of the surprising efficacy of such
      formulations stemmed from surprising discoveries regarding the
      role of mandelic acid and related carboxylic acids in suppressing
      odor generation on the body, and from other experimental
      discoveries regarding the surprising benefits of topically applied
      caffeine in reducing underarm odor, alone or in combination with
      alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The xanthine compound and carboxylic acid in many
      embodiments are combined with a carrier that may be a liquid such
      as an aqueous solution, a wet wipe formulation with alcohol or
      substantially alcohol free, or a viscous carrier having
      substantially greater viscosity than water. The viscous carrier
      may be a lipophilic carrier such as a mineral oil, a gel, a cream,
      an emulsion, a bioadhesive, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The xanthine compound and a suitable carboxylic acid may be
      combined with additional ingredients such as organic oils,
      silicone compounds, cyclomethicone, water, various polymers that
      control viscosity, film formation, or other mechanical or fluid
      properties, fragrances, coloring agents, encapsulated compounds,
      solvents, propellants, surfactants, and the like. For example, an
      antiperspirant may comprise caffeine or related compounds in a
      base made with a starch with bonding agents such as a wax or oil.
      In another embodiment, the antiperspirant may comprise active
      ingredients such as caffeine and an acidifying agent such as a
      carboxylic acid combined with a silicone wax, cyclomethicone, and
      a fatty alcohol according to the carrier materials discussed in
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,486.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As used herein, “pudendum” refers to the external genitalia
      and surrounding regions, including the interlabial folds, the
      clitoral region, the perineum, the perianal region, the vulvar and
      perivulvar regions, and the intergluteal folds.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As used herein, “deodorants” and “antiperspirants” both
      refer to compositions that are effective in directly or indirectly
      reducing unwanted body odors associated with perspiration and/or
      bacteria on the surface of the skin. “Deodorants” may reduce odor
      through a variety of means, and such means in the various
      embodiments of the present invention may include suppression of
      bacterial activity, antimicrobial mechanisms, chemical
      interference with odor generation mechanisms, removal or
      modification of feedstuff for odor-producing bacteria, and the
      like. “Antiperspirants” generally work to reduce the production of
      perspiration, and may do so, for example, by decreasing the size
      of pores associated with sweat glands, blocking sweat glands,
      reducing the flow of blood or other fluids to sweat glands, and
      the like. A deodorant may function as an antiperspirant but need
      not do so to be a deodorant. The compositions of various
      embodiments of the present invention may generally be described as
      deodorants and in many cases may generally be described as
      antiperspirants, though a composition that has limited
      antiperspirant efficacy is not necessarily outside the scope of
      the claimed invention, which is defined by the claims appended
      hereafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As used in the description, and in the claims, the term
      “alpha-hydroxy acid” refers to compounds represented by the
      following generic structure:<br>
      <br>
      (R1)(R2))C(OH)COOH<br>
      <br>
      where R1 and R2 are H, alkyl, aralkyl or aryl groups. In addition,
      R1 and R2 may carry OH, CHO, COOH and alkoxy groups. Typical
      alkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups for R1 and R2 include methyl,
      ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl, lauryl, stearyl,
      benzyl and phenyl etc. The alpha-hydroxy acids include, but are
      not limited to, lactic acid, mandelic acid, glycolic acid, malic
      acid, 2-hydroxyoctanoic acid, 2-hydroxydecanoic acid, and citric
      acid. In some embodiments, the alpha-hydroxy acid has 13 or fewer
      carbons, 12 or fewer carbons, 11 or fewer carbons, 10 or fewer
      carbons, 9 or fewer carbons, or 8 or fewer carbons, such as
      between 2 and 14 carbons, between 2 and 11 carbons, between 3 and
      11 carbons, between 3 and 13 carbons, between 7 and 12 carbons, or
      between 8 and 12 carbons.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] To provide an effective quantity of a suitable
      alpha-hydroxy acid in the environment on the pudendum, a viscous
      carrier substantially more viscous than water can be effective in
      retaining the material. As used herein, a material such as a
      liquid is said to be “viscous” when it has a viscosity of from
      about 6 mPa·s (millipascal-seconds) to about 300,000 mPa·s when
      measured at 25° C., more specifically from 15 mPa·s to 150,000
      mPa·s, and more specifically still from 50 mPa·s to 150,000 mPa·s.
      Viscosity herein is measured on neat composition using a
      Brookfield RVT, T-C Spindle at 5 rpms and Heliopath Stand, as
      described in US Pat. Application 20060002876, “Personal Care
      Compositions with Improved Hyposensitivity,” published Jan. 5,
      2006 by C. M. Cahen, herein incorporated by reference to the
      extent that it is noncontradictory herewith. In general, a viscous
      composition typically provides improved application
      characteristics when compared with products having a viscosity
      similar to that of water when applied directly by the user using
      manual (i.e. hand) application.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A lipophilic viscous carrier such as a cream can further
      protect the skin and reduce risks of irritation from the
      alpha-hydroxy acid. One or more suitable alpha-hydroxy acids in
      combination with a viscous lipophilic carrier can be applied to
      the pudendum using the fingers or via a wipe or pad, or can be
      transferred from another article such as the pretreated surface of
      an absorbent feminine pad such as a pantiliner. In typical
      embodiments, the composition is only applied to the pudendum or
      other external skin and is not applied to the vagina. Indeed,
      indicia or other information associated with compositions within
      the scope of the present invention may direct the user to not
      apply the composition within the vagina, and may further indicate
      that the formulation is intended for application only to the
      pudendum if prevention or reduction of fishy odor is desired, or
      for improved health of the pudendal region.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Thus, in one aspect, a product is disclosed for application
      to the pudendum of a user to reduce fishy odor, the product
      comprising about 0.5% by weight or greater mandelic acid and 0.5%
      by weight or greater of a xanthine compound or salt thereof in a
      viscous lipophilic carrier, the product being physically
      associated with indicia specifying that the product should be
      applied to the pudendum. As used herein, “physically associated
      with” refers to indicia on an item physically proximate to the
      product to enable a user to obtain the information or directions
      given by the indicia, and more specifically refers to indicia such
      as printed instructions located on a container that contains the
      products or on a label or other printed surface connected to a
      container of the product or its associated packaging. Examples can
      include instructions disposed on or near a dispenser of the
      product, a printed card intended to be distributed with the
      product and provided near or attached to the packaging, or a label
      on a tube or tub that contains the product. Indicia need not be
      physically printed with ink but may be displayed in other ways,
      including electronic display on electronic paper or other display
      means physically associated with the product.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Compositions within the scope of the present invention may
      be provided in the form of pre-treated wipes, including wet wipes
      or wipes pretreated with a viscous lotion, or may be applied to a
      wipe shortly before contacting the wipe to the pudendum or any
      part thereof. In one embodiment, for example, a cream comprising
      one or more suitable alpha-hydroxy acids is applied to a wipe,
      including a dry wipe or a wet wipe, prior to use. The wipe may be
      packaged with the cream already in contact therewith, or may be
      packaged with or marketed in association with a quantity of the
      cream that can be manually applied to the wipe prior to contacting
      the wipe with the pudendum, such that the cream is transferred to
      the pudendum. As used herein, a “cream” is generally an emulsion
      having a kinematic viscosity of greater than 500 centistokes,
      typically in the range of 10,000-50,000 centistokes.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The carrier need not be lipophilic and may, for example,
      comprise an aqueous gel or other aqueous bioadhesive comprise a
      hydrated polymer. Alternatively, a substantially aqueous,
      low-viscosity carrier may be used similar to traditional
      water-based wet wipe formulations, but comprising a suitable
      alpha-hydroxy acid. For the alpha-hydroxy acid to remain effective
      on the pudendum for a prolonged period of time after application
      with a wet wipe-style product, additional measures may be taken
      such as encapsulation of at least a portion of a quantity of an
      alpha-hydroxy acid for sustained release thereof, or providing of
      delivery means for sustained contact of a low-pH solution with a
      portion of the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In some versions, the with one or more suitable
      alpha-hydroxy acids is provided in a container or with a kit that
      contains or is physically associated with indicia instructing the
      user that the composition is to be applied to the pudendum. The
      indicia may indicate that the composition should only be applied
      to pudendum or more generally that it is intended for use on the
      pudendum or should be applied on the pudendum. The indicia may
      further specify suggested methods for repeat application,
      including time intervals or conditions which would require more
      frequent application. In some versions, the indicia indicate that
      the product can help control fishy odor arising from the pudendum,
      and may indicate the benefit can be obtained by maintaining a
      suitable pH range in the environment on the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In one aspect, a personal care composition is disclosed
      which comprises a viscous lipophilic carrier and at least 1% by
      weight of an alpha-hydroxy acid having a molecular weight of at
      least 125 or at least 140 (the molecular weight of mandelic acid
      is about 152), or having at least 1% by weight of mandelic acid or
      a derivative thereof. In some versions, the alpha-hydroxy acid may
      have a solubility in water of at least 1 gram per 10 ml of water
      (mandelic acid has a solubility of 1 gram in 6.3 ml of water) at
      25° C., and/or may have an acidity expressed as pKa of at least
      about 2.0 or at least about 3.0 (larger numbers indicate weaker
      acids; mandelic acid has a reported pKa of 3.37 and lactic acid
      has a reported pKa of 3.86). The composition may further comprise
      at least 0.5% by weight of a xanthine compound such as caffeine,
      or salts thereof, and more particularly may have from 0.5% by
      weight to 8.3% by weight of a xanthine compound or salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The personal care composition may be provided in a
      container provided with indicia instructing users to apply the
      composition to the external skin of the pudendum, and may further
      specify that so doing will help reduce undesirable odor or the
      bacteria that cause such odor, and may further indicate that odor
      control can thereby be provided over a prolonged period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In another aspect, a method is disclosed for reducing
      undesirable odors arising from the pudendum of a user, the method
      comprising: a) providing a composition comprising at least 0.5% by
      weight of mandelic acid or a derivative thereof disposed in a
      viscous substantially lipophilic carrier, and b) instructing a
      user to apply the composition to the user's pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The method may further comprise making a claim that the
      composition is effective in reducing fishy odor, and may also
      include further instructing the user to repeat application of the
      composition to the pudendum after a prolonged period of time has
      occurred and/or after exposure to conditions likely to elevate the
      pH of the environment of the pudendum, such as intercourse,
      contract with blood or feces, or bathing with soap.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In one aspect, a wipe product is disclosed for reducing the
      production of unwanted odor from the pudendum, the product
      comprising an openable enclosure containing at least one wipe
      pretreated with an acidifying composition, the acidifying
      composition comprising mandelic acid and a xanthine, the
      acidifying composition having a pH of from about 3.5 to about 4.5
      and further comprising at least 50% by weight of a viscous
      lipophilic carrier, wherein upon wiping the pudendum with one of
      the at least one wipes, the acidifying composition is adapted to
      transfer in part to the pudendum and have a substantial portion
      thereof remain in contact with the pudendum for a prolonged period
      of time after wiping, thereby effectively lowering the pH on the
      treated portion of the pudendum for a prolonged period of time.
      The acidifying composition may comprise mandelic acid or its
      derivatives, and in related embodiments mandelic acid in an
      effective amount is present in combination with one more
      additional alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic acid, in a
      substantially lipophilic carrier having rheological properties of
      a bioadhesive or otherwise have sufficient non-Newtonian
      properties (e.g., a relatively high yield stress) such that it
      does not readily flow off the body under the influence of gravity
      after application to the body. Other alpha-hydroxy acids that may
      be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As used herein, a material with a relatively high yield
      stress may be said to “not substantially flow in response to
      gravitational force” or “not readily flow off a surface under the
      influence of gravity” if, when applied uniformly to a vertical
      surface such as a vertical sheet of clean sodium glass with the
      applied layer having a thickness of 2 millimeters over a 2 cm×2 cm
      area defining a square with top and bottom sides parallel to the
      horizontal plane, the effect of gravity in redistributing the
      applied material is relatively minor such that after 30 seconds of
      exposure to gravity, the upper half of the square (a 2 cm×1 cm
      region of the coated area) still has at least 30% of the
      originally applied mass (with no flow at all, it would have 50% of
      the originally applied mass). The test should be done at 23° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In some embodiments, a first alpha-hydroxy acid such as
      mandelic acid and optionally a second alpha-hydroxy acid
      composition, such as lactic acid or other acids, are combined with
      a xanthine compound to provide a long-lasting acidifying
      composition that can control the pH of the pudendum after
      application for a prolonged period of time such as at least about
      10 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 24
      hours. Indeed, in some embodiments, it has been found that a
      single treatment with compositions described herein can provide
      effective control in preventing fishy odor for periods of 24 hours
      or longer.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In some embodiments, the carrier can be a lipophilic
      carrier such as a cream comprising an oil/water emulsion and
      having a finite yield stress to allow substantial quantities to
      remain in contact with the body after application over a prolonged
      period of time. Yield stress may be measured using a static
      vane-based test method with the Brookfield YR-1 of Brookfield
      Engineering Laboratories (Boston, Mass.). The yield stress at 25°
      C. may be, for example about 2 kPa s or less, or about 1 kP s or
      less, or about 0.2 kPa s or less. Other techniques for providing
      sustained presence of acids may be considered in various
      embodiments, including the use of time-release encapsulation
      technology or barriers that release the actives when triggered by
      moisture, pH, activity, or other conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The carrier can be made from a variety of known agents. It
      may comprise a viscous, lipophilic base that is substantially
      water free or is a mixture of lipophilic components and an aqueous
      solution such as an emulsion. The carrier may also be a
      hydrophilic base such as a gel, including bioadhesive gels, or a
      solution such as the wetting solution of a wet wipe. The carrier
      may also be a foam.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In one version, a personal care composition for preventing
      fishy odor is delivered using a wipe. The wipe may be provided
      with the composition already present, such as a wet wipe or
      impregnated wipe holding the viscous carrier and active
      ingredients (i.e., mandelic acid and a xanthine compound such as
      caffeine or salts thereof). Alternatively, the composition may be
      provided separately for the user to apply using a wipe or other
      substrate such as a tissue. In one version, a single-use pouch or
      kit comprises a wipe and a separate dose of the composition that
      can be released on to the wipe prior to application.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Compositions according to selected embodiments of the
      present invention may have a pH (as measured, for example, with pH
      test trips at 22° C.) of about 3.0 to about 5.0, or from about 3.2
      to about 4.5, or from about 3.3 to 4.2, such as from about 3.5 to
      about 4.2.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Compositions according to selected embodiments of the
      present invention can be provided in a wide variety of forms, such
      as gels, creams, foams, impregnated pads or strips, and the like,
      many of which can be suitable for prolonged contact against the
      human body. Prolonged contact can be achieved direct application
      of the active ingredients onto the skin by any known means,
      including the use of bioadherents, or by mechanical means in which
      an article comprising a composition of the present invention is
      held in place against the body by, for example, contact with
      underwear or other clothing.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Some forms of useful products are intended for brief
      contact with the human body, such as wet wipes or treated pads
      that may make brief contact with the skin of the pudendum to
      deliver active ingredients, though in such products, the active
      ingredients may be provided in a composition that remains on the
      skin to provide protection over a prolonged period of time.
      Compositions of selected embodiments of the present invention may
      also be provided in forms intended for direct application to the
      human body such as rinses, washes, sprays, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] For embodiments in which a formulation is applied using a
      wipe, the wipe can serve not only to deliver the active
      ingredients to lower the pH on the body over a prolonged time but
      also to mechanically remove debris. Methods of use could include
      daily treatment such as after bathing to clean and acidify the
      pudendum. The treatment could include use of a prepackaged,
      pretreated wipe or of an ordinary wipe that is wetted or coated
      with a formulation as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In other embodiments, at least one active ingredient may be
      in substantially dry or solid form, such as a powder attached to
      or disposed within a pad. When wetted by water or aqueous fluids
      prior to, during, or after application of the active ingredient to
      the body, the active ingredient may at least partially dissolve to
      more effectively control the acidity of the environment (e.g.,
      that of material on the skin of the pudendum) or to deliver other
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In another aspect, a method is disclosed for reducing or
      preventing malodor from the pudendum, comprising: (a) providing a
      user with a product comprising an acidifying composition having at
      least about 0.5% by weight of mandelic acid and 0.5% by weight of
      a xanthine compound or salts thereof, said acidifying composition
      having a pH between about 3.2 and 4.5, and (b) providing
      directions to the user to apply the acidifying composition to the
      pudendum. The acidifying composition may further comprise at least
      1% by weight of a second carboxylic acid component such as lactic
      acid. In some embodiments of the method, the acidifying
      composition may have a non-zero yield stress and the directions
      for use are adapted to cause the acidifying composition to
      effectively remain in contact with the human body for a period of
      at least 10 minutes after applying the acidifying composition to
      the pudendum according to the directions. The product and the
      directions may be adapted such that the composition, when applied
      according to the directions, will be effectively kept in contact
      with the pudendum for a period of at least 60 minutes, and wherein
      the pH on the skin in contact with the composition is between
      about 3.5 and 4.5 during a majority of the at least 60 minutes.
      Skin pH can be measured with dry pH electrodes, as is known in the
      art. See, for example, B. Eberlein-Konig et al., Acta Derm
      Venereol. 2000, vol. 80, pp. 188-191, available online at
      http://adv.medicaljournals.se/files/pdf/80/3/188-191.pdf.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The method may further comprise (c) providing one or more
      wipes for use with the product, and the step of providing
      directions to the user may then include providing directions to
      transfer the product from at least one of the one or more wipes to
      the pudendum.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0068] FIG. 1A depicts an individual use product 20 containing a
      folded wet wipe 24 sealed within a sealed pouch 22, the wipe 24
      comprising a personal care composition (not shown) for reducing
      malodor in the pudendum. The pouch 22 may be made of a film or
      foil wrap or any other suitable flexible materials, and generally
      comprises a front side 26, a back side 28, a top end 32, and a
      bottom end 34, the top end 32 comprising a tear line 30 which may
      be perforated, for example, and a tear-away portion 36 which is
      removed by tearing along the tear line 30 to open the pouch 22. Of
      course, many alternative means may be used to provide for opening
      the pouch 22, including resealable flaps (not shown), tear lines
      along any region of the pouch 22, slidable or resealable closures
      (not shown) such as those commonly used in sandwich bags, and the
      like. In related embodiments not shown here, multiple wipes may be
      disposed in a pouch 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 1B depicts the pouch 22 of FIG. 1A after the tear-away
      portion 36 thereof has been removed, opening the pouch 36. As
      depicted, the wipe 24 has been partially removed from the pouch
      22. The wipe 24 is a folded wipe with a Z-style fold, though any
      suitable folded configuration may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 1C shows the wipe 24 of FIG. 1B having been fully
      removed from the pouch 22 and substantially unfolded. The depicted
      wipe 24 is generally rectangular in shape, but any suitable shape
      may be used such as oval, elliptical, triangular, irregular
      shapes, and so forth (not shown). The wipe 24 may have any
      suitable unfolded width and length. For example, the wet wipe may
      have an unfolded length of from about 2.0 to about 80.0
      centimeters or from about 10.0 to about 25.0 centimeters and an
      unfolded width of from about 2.0 to about 80.0 centimeters or from
      about 10.0 to about 25.0 centimeters. FIG. 2 shows one version of
      a container 40 holding multiple individually wrapped products 20
      such as those of FIG. 1A, each having a sealed pouch 22 comprising
      wet wipes (not shown) for reducing malodor, further comprising a
      top end 32, a tear line 30, and a tear-away portion 36. The
      container 40 may be made of paperboard, plastic, foil, foam, or
      combinations thereof, and generally comprises a resilient rear
      panel 42 and a pocket element 44 defining a pocket 46. A bottom
      element 48 closed the bottom of the pocket 46. The pocket 46 can
      receive a plurality of the individually wrapped products 20. An
      optional closure element (not shown) may be attached to the rear
      panel 42 or the pocket element 44 that can be folded or pivoted
      over the exposed products 20 to close the container 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The wipe 24 may comprise a basesheet with total (dry) basis
      weight of from about 25 to about 120 grams per square meter and or
      from about 40 to about 90 grams per square meter. The basesheet
      may comprise a multilayer structure with, for example, laminated,
      bonded, or adjacent layers differing in fibers (e.g., coform with
      polyethylene versus coform with polypropylene or differing in the
      cellulosic fibers used), fiber treatments, adhesives, etc. Coform
      may be used for one or more layers or components, as described in
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al. which issued Jul. 11,
      1978; U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,313 to McFarland et al. which issued
      Aug. 5, 1986; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,624 which issued Sep. 27,
      1994; which are herein incorporated by reference to the extent
      they are consistent herewith.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] FIG. 3 shows a telescopic view of a portion of a wipes
      container 50 showing a lower body 56 adapted to contain a stack of
      wipes 24 and a cream dispenser 52 depicted here as a simple well
      54 holding a quantity of cream 56 comprising a composition
      effective in controlling malodor on the pudendum. The well 54 may
      comprise a resilient material such as a polyolefin plastic or may
      have flexible walls. The well 54 may be separable from the lower
      body 56 of the wipes container 50 or may be unitary therewith,
      such as a well 54 formed with the lower body 56 from plastic
      injection molding (not shown). The cream dispenser 52, in other
      embodiments, may be replaced with other known dispensers of
      formulations, including flexible pouches (not shown) that can
      release a cream by squeezing, or dispensers with mechanical means
      for dispensing such as pumps (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The lower body 56 has a floor 62 and side walls 60. The
      lower body 56 receives the stack of wipes 24 as shown along the
      telescoping axis 64A, and also receives the cream dispenser 52
      along the parallel telescoping axis 64B.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] A covering for the container 50 is not shown, but any known
      covering may be used such as a removable lid or a hinged lid
      connected to or integral with the lower body 56. In use, the
      covering (not shown) may be opened to allow a user to remove a
      wipe 24, apply a quantity of the cream 56 to the wipe 24, and then
      apply the wipe to the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 4 shows a plan view of a wipe 24 with multiple
      discrete zones 70 comprising an active ingredient for reducing
      malodor. The wipe 24 itself may be a nonwoven web or other
      flexible porous substrate, and may be a wet wipe impregnated with
      an aqueous solution or may be a dry wipe. The discrete zones 70 in
      this embodiment are shown as circles, but they may be in any
      shape, size, or arrangement, such as parallel bands, irregular
      patches, rectangles, lines and dashes, triangular regions, and
      combinations thereof. The discrete zones 70 may comprise a cream,
      ointment, lotion, or semi-solid material comprising a composition
      for reducing malodor according to various embodiments described
      herein, The composition may comprise an acidifying agent and may,
      for example, comprise caffeine and mandelic acid in a viscous
      lipophilic carrier and may have a pH from about 2.8 to about 5 or
      more specifically from about 3.2 to about 4.5, and more
      specifically still from 3.2 to 4.5. The discrete zones 70 may be
      substantially topical relative to the wipe 24, such that a
      majority of the mass in the discrete zones 70 is deposited above
      the upper surface of the substrate of the wipe 24 (e.g., elevated
      regions). Alternatively, the discrete zones 70 may be defined by
      matter that is substantially impregnated into the wipe 24, or may
      comprise both elevated regions and impregnated regions. The wipe
      24 may be textured (not shown), with treated discrete zones 70
      corresponding to topographical features on the wipe such as
      elevated structures or depressed regions (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIGS. 5A and 5B, 6A and 6B, and 7A and 7B show experimental
      results regarding the suppression of TMA production by bacteria in
      the presence of choline as a function of time and as a function of
      the presence of a material according to an embodiment of the
      present invention. These figures are described in more detail in
      the discussion of Example 6 hereafter, but do show that a
      formulation according to an embodiment of the present invention is
      effective in reducing TMA production by bacterial that are
      frequently found on human skin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FURTHER DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0077] The acidifying components of the personal care composition
      generally include a first alpha-hydroxy acid such as mandelic acid
      (also known as phenylglycolic acid) and optionally a second
      alpha-hydroxy acid composition such as lactic acid and/or other
      carboxylic acids, including acids such as citric, glycolic,
      2-hydroxybutyric acid, tartaric acid; gluconic acid or other
      isomers of pentahydroxyhexanoic acid; hydroxycaprylic acid, leucic
      acid (2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid), ethylglycolic acid, malic
      acid, and the like. U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,171, “Amphoteric
      Compositions and Polymeric Forms of Alpha Hydroxyacids, and Their
      Therapeutic Use,” issued February, 1992 to Yu et al., describes
      alpha hydroxyl acids that can be considered for use with various
      embodiments of the present invention. The first alpha-hydroxy acid
      may have at least 7 or at least 8 carbons for each carboxylic acid
      group and may have a molecular weight from about 135 to about 400,
      more specifically from about 135 to about 250, from about 135 to
      about 200, or from 145 to 170. The first alpha-hydroxy acid may be
      monoprotic (a monocarboxylic acid) or, in some versions, diprotic
      (a dicarboxylic acid), though larger numbers of carboxylic acid
      groups may be considered. In other versions, the first
      alpha-hydroxy acid or both the first and second alpha-hydroxy acid
      may have a molecular weight of 90 or greater, 100 or greater, 120
      or greater, 150 or greater, or 160 or greater. The first
      alpha-hydroxy acid also may have at least one aromatic ring such
      as a phenyl group. (Mandelic acid is the smallest alpha hydroxyl
      acid with an aromatic ring.) Without wishing to be bound by
      theory, it is believed that the first alpha-hydroxy acid as
      described is large enough to not rapidly penetrate into the
      stratum corneum of the skin, allowing it to remain present and
      active on the surface of the skin for a prolonged period of time,
      while it is also small enough to be biologically active to modify
      the bacterial environment on the skin and/or to maintain an acidic
      condition on the surface of the skin. The relatively high
      molecular weight and larger number of carbons per acid group in
      such acids may also reduce the potential for irritation to the
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In some embodiments, other alpha-hydroxy acids comprising
      aromatic rings may be used, including derivatives of mandelic acid
      such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,224, “Method for
      Producing Optically Active Mandelic Acid Derivatives,” issued Aug.
      17, 2004 to Mitsuhashi et al., or the dimmers and other
      derivatives described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,619, “Method for
      Preventing Sexually Transmitted Diseases,” issued Aug. 3, 1999 to
      Zaneveld et al., both of which are herein incorporated by
      reference to the extent that it is noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The second alpha-hydroxy acid composition may, in some
      embodiments, help improve the efficacy of the first alpha-hydroxy
      acid while also contributing to desired acidity on the skin and
      optionally may also have an antimicrobial effect relative to
      unwanted bacteria that otherwise could contribute to an undesired
      fishy odor. The second alpha-hydroxy acid composition may comprise
      alpha-hydroxy acids having, individually or averaged, a molecular
      weight of about 170 or less, such as from 75 to 135, from 75 to
      125, or from 80 to 85, or from 86 to 92.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The alpha-hydroxy acids in total may be present in any
      suitable concentration, such as 30% by weight or less, 20% by
      weight or less, or 10% by weight or less, and more specifically
      from about 0.3% to 10% (percentages in reference to chemical
      compositions herein will be understood to be weight percent unless
      otherwise indicated), from about 0.5% to about 6%, from about 1%
      to about 15%, or from about 0.5% to about 3.5%, or from about 0.1%
      to about 2.5%.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In one version, the second alpha-hydroxy acid composition
      comprises at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about
      70% or at least about 93% lactic acid by weight (i.e., weight %)
      of lactic acid, such as from about 30% to about 90%, or from about
      50% to about 95%; or from about 50% to about 95% lactic acid by
      weight. In one version, the second alpha-hydroxy acid is
      substantially all lactic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Examples of formulations can include lotions, creams, gels,
      wipe solutions, sprays, powders, etc., with the following
      acidifying compositions, expressed as weight percents: 1.5% lactic
      acid and 0.5% mandelic acid; 2.5% lactic acid and 1% mandelic
      acid; 25% lactic acid and 2% mandelic acid; 10% lactic acid and
      10% mandelic acid; 5% lactic acid and 4% mandelic acid; etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The alpha-hydroxy acids may, at least in part, be provided
      in time-release systems that gradually release the alpha-hydroxy
      acid to be effective in controlling the pH of the pudendum.
      Time-release technology can include microencapsulation and other
      systems known in the art. Time-release or other controlled release
      means are well known in the art. Some versions, by way of example,
      are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,136, “Controlled Release
      Encapsulation Compositions,” issued May 26, 1998 to Black et al.;
      and U.S. Pat. No. 6,835,397, “Controlled Release Encapsulated
      Bioactive Substances,” issued Dec. 28, 2004 to Lee et al.; both of
      which are herein incorporated by reference to the extent that they
      are noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In many embodiments, the formulations and methods disclosed
      herein avoid the problems of stinging or other forms of irritation
      that are known in some prior products. Sting-free formulations,
      for example, may be substantially free of ethanol, propanol, or
      other agents that may sting delicate tissues in the pudendal
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] While the products and methods described herein are
      particular suited for controlling unwanted fishy odor from the
      pudendum of adult or teenaged females, they may also be adapted
      for males in general, such as adult males. They may also be
      adapted for children in general, such as infants and toddlers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Absorbent Articles</b><br>
      <br>
      [0086] A wide variety of absorbent articles may be used to deliver
      formulations or assist in modifying the conditions of the pudendum
      to inhibit odor formation and release. Absorbent articles can
      include feminine pads, interlabial devices, tampons, incontinence
      devices such as diapers and related articles, briefs, panties, and
      the like. Description of exemplary products can be found in, by
      way of example only, the following: U.S. Pat. No. 7,201,743,

      [0087] Disposable absorbent articles generally have a body facing
      intake layer comprising a porous web or film, an absorbent core,
      and an impervious backsheet, with other optional components as is
      known in the art. In some versions, the intake layer is integral
      with the absorbent core or is not present as a distinct separate
      component. In some versions, the backsheet is integral with the
      absorbent core or similar functionality is provided by treating
      the absorbent core with, for example, a hydrophilic material on
      the outer surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The absorbent core can be made of any suitable
      liquid-absorbent materials such as comminuted wood pulp that is
      generally referred to as airfelt, as well as materials such as
      cotton; creped cellulose wadding; meltblown polymers including
      composites with wood fibers such as coform; chemically modified or
      cross-linked cellulosic fibers; synthetic fibers such as
      bicomponent spunbond or crimped polyester fibers; peat moss;
      tissue materials including tissue wraps and tissue laminates;
      absorbent foams; absorbent sponges; superabsorbent polymers;
      absorbent gelling materials; or any equivalent material or
      combinations of materials, or mixtures of these. The absorbent
      materials may comprise folded tissues, woven materials, nonwoven
      webs, needle punched rayon, and thin layers of foam. Absorbent
      portions of the product may comprise a single material or a
      combination of materials, such as a wrapping layer surrounding a
      central wadding comprised of a different material.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The backsheet may comprise a woven or nonwoven material,
      polymeric films such as thermoplastic films of polyethylene or
      polypropylene, or composite materials such as a film-coated
      nonwoven material. It may be flexible and adapted to fit into or
      attach to undergarments such as panties. It may be provided with
      adhesive material and may have tabs for wrapping around the sides
      of undergarments. Other attachment means that may cooperate with
      or attach to the backsheet may be used such as hook and loop
      attachment or other mechanical attachment means, coadhesive
      materials, snaps, belts, ligaments, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Methods of applying the acidifying compositions to the
      absorbent articles include spraying, blade coating, contact
      coating, curtain coating, application with metered rods,
      flexographic printing, gravure printing, ink-jet printing, other
      digital printing techniques, and other known methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Lotioned topsheets and methods of manufacturing them are
      described in US 20040064117, “Absorbent Article Having a Lotioned
      Topsheet,” published Apr. 1, 2004 by Hammons et al., herein

      <br>
      [0092] U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,041, “Diaper Having a Lotioned
      Topsheet,” issued Sep. 12, 2000 to Roe et al., herein incorporated
      by reference to the extent that it is noncontradictory herewith,
      describes an absorbent article worn next to the skin of a user
      that can transfer a lotion on the topsheet of the article to the
      skin of the wearer. In one version, the Roe patent describes an
      absorbent article with a topsheet having a lotion coating which is
      semi-solid or solid at 20° C. and which is partially transferable
      to the wearer's skin, the lotion coating comprising from about 10
      to about 95% of a substantially water free emollient having a
      plastic or fluid consistency at 20° C., wherein the emollient
      contains about 5% or less water and emollient comprising a member
      selected from the group consisting of petroleum-based emollients,
      fatty acid ester emollients, alkyl ethoxylate emollients, and
      mixtures thereof, further comprising from about 5 to about 90% of
      an agent capable of immobilizing the emollient on said outer
      surface of the topsheet, wherein the immobilizing agent has a
      melting point of at least about 35° C. and is miscible with the
      emollient.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The immobilizing agent may comprise a member selected from
      the group consisting of waxes, polyhydroxy fatty acid amides,
      C14-C22 fatty alcohols, C12-C22 fatty acids, C12-C22 fatty alcohol
      ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 2 to
      about 30, and mixtures thereof. The natural fats or oils of the
      oil-in-water emulsion composition may be selected from the group
      consisting of: avocado oil, apricot oil, babassu oil, borage oil,
      camellia oil, canola oil, castor oil, coconut oil, corn oil
      cottonseed oil, evening primrose oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil,
      hydrogenated palm kernel oil, maleated soybean oil, meadowfoam
      oil, palm kernel oil, phospholipids, rapeseed oil, palmitic acid,
      stearic acid, linoleic acid, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol,
      myristyl alcohol, benenyl alcohol, rose hip oil, sunflower oil,
      soybean oil, and mixtures thereof. The amount of said fats or oils
      used in the composition may be from about 0.5 to about 10% by
      weight, and more preferably from about 1 to about 5% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] U.S. Pat. No. 5,607,760 to Roe, herein incorporated by
      reference to the extent that it is noncontradictory herewith,
      describes a lotion coating on the outer surface of the non-woven
      top sheet of an absorbent article, such as diapers, pull-on
      products, adult incontinence devices, and the like. A waterless
      lotion composition is reported to convey a desirable therapeutic
      or protective coating benefit and to be effective in reducing the
      adherence of bowel movement to the skin. The lotion is solid or
      semi-solid at 20° C. with a preferred melting point of about 45°
      C. In one version of a process for the application of the lotion
      to a substrate, the lotion composition is placed in a heated tank
      operating at a suitable temperature such as about 63° C., then
      sprayed onto the substrate by a spray head operating at a warmer
      temperature such as about 71° C. In some versions, the system of
      Roe can be adapted for application of formulations to prevent
      fishy odor described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Absorbent articles capable of transferring a coated or
      impregnated material to the body of the wearer may be made

      incorporated by reference to the extent that they are
      noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Wipes for use with the formulations described herein may
      also be made, used, or dispensed according to any of the
      following: U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,581, “Wet Wipe,” issued Mar. 8,
      1994 to Viazmensky et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,537,631, “Roll of
      Wet Wipes,” issued Mar. 25, 2003 to Rivera et al., all of which
      are herein incorporated by reference to the extent that they are
      noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Wipes may be provided from or in association with
      dispensers that provide a quantity of a formulation as described
      herein useful in preventing or reducing odor from the pudendum.
      Such a dispenser can include a combination of wipe dispenser and
      spray applicator for dispensing active ingredients, as described,
      for example, in US 20090057331, “Wipes Dispenser,” published Mar.
      5, 2009 by Fryan et al., herein incorporated by reference to the
      extent that it is noncontradictory herewith. Wipes be dispensed
      from containers such as plastic or metal tubs or cylinders, from
      flexible pouches such as resealable pouches, form cardboard or
      other cellulosic containers, and from other known devices for
      dispensing wipes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,601,737, “Baby Wipe/Rash Cream
      Dispenser,” issued Aug. 5, 2003 to Gartenberg, herein incorporated
      by reference to the extent that it is noncontradictory herewith,
      can also be adapted to dispense an effective quantity of a viscous
      composition comprising acidifying agents for the reduction of
      fishy odor when applied to the pudendum, such that the viscous
      composition can be applied to a wipe from the dispenser to assist
      in application of the formulation to the pudendum. The wipes may
      be wet or dry wipes, and may be pretreated with cleansing
      compositions, fragrance, and the like, which can be applied in
      addition to the acidifying composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In one embodiment, individually enclosed wipes are
      provided, similar to known towelettes such as those discussed in
      WO/2003/051227, “Feminine Wipe for Symptomatic Treatment of
      Vaginitis,” published Jun. 23, 2003 by Syed Rizvi, herein
      incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith. Such individual wipes may have
      dimensions such as 8×5.25 inch rectangles, or more generally,
      rectangles or other shapes with a first dimension and a second
      orthogonal dimension generally aligned with the major axes of the
      shape (e.g., the length of the sides of a rectangle) ranging from
      about 4 cm to about 40 cm, or from about 9 cm to about 30 cm. The
      aspect ratio (e.g., the length divided by the width, with the
      longer dimension being taken as the length) may be about 1, or
      from about 1 to about 1.6, or from about 1 to about 2.5, or about
      1.1 or greater, or less than 3, by way of example. The wipe may be
      folded into smaller dimensions prior to use, and ma be packaged or
      stored prior to consumer purchase with individual folded wipe
      dimensions with first and second orthogonal dimensions ranging
      from about 2 cm to about 18 cm, or from about 4 cm to about 12 cm,
      or less than about 13 cm, with an aspect ratio of from about 1, or
      from about 1 to about 1.6, or from about 1 to about 2.5, or about
      1.1 or greater, or less than about 2. A pouch into which a folded
      wipe is placed may have similar but slightly greater dimensions
      than the wipe itself, with at least one dimension of the pouch
      being larger than the corresponding dimension of the wipe
      contained therein by no more than about 5%, about 10%, about 15%,
      or about 25% of the corresponding dimension of the wipe. The
      amount of fluid contained in the pouch may equal the amount of
      fluid that a saturated or less-than-saturated wipe can hold and
      may be carried completely by the wipe during manufacturing (i.e.,
      no additional fluid is added to the pouch beyond what is carried
      by the wipe itself). Alternatively, the pouch may contain
      additional fluid that is placed in the pouch in addition to what
      the wipe carries prior to contact with the pouch, or the wipe may
      be substantially dry prior to placement in the pouch and may then
      be combined with fluid prior to sealing of the pouch.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In yet another version, a substantially dry wipe may be
      placed in a sealed pouch, after which liquid is injected or
      otherwise introduced into the pouch via, for example, a one-way
      flow valve or other means, optionally followed by additional
      sealing to prevent leakage. The amount of fluid in the pouch may
      range, by way of example, from 1 ml to 50 ml, from 2 ml to 25 ml,
      or from 5 ml to 10 ml. Alternatively, the amount of liquid present
      in the pouch or in any wipe may have a mass equal to about 10% or
      more, about 30% or more, about 60% or more, about 80% or more,
      from about 30% to about 300%, from about 50% to about 200%, or
      from about 70% to about 150%, of the mass of the dry wipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In one embodiment, the wipes are delivered in a flexible or
      rigid container integral with a formulation dispenser for applying
      an odor-controlling low-pH formulation on the wipes or the
      pudendum directly. The formulation dispenser can be a tab or other
      closure element on a pouch that contains a viscous composition
      that can be squeezed out through an opening onto a wipe or onto
      the fingers. In a related embodiment, the opening of a tab to
      access the contents of a container of wipes may also open a seal
      for a quantity of a viscous formulation to be applied to the wipe.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Product Forms</b><br>
      <br>
      [0105] A variety of other product forms can be considered.
      Single-use sponges in individual wraps can be used, for example,
      with instructions and indicia similar to those for wipe products.
      The sponge may be polyurethane, regenerated cellulose, and other
      known sponge materials. The compositions described herein may be
      impregnated in the sponge or applied shortly prior to use. One
      example of related materials that can be adapted for use with the
      compositions described herein are the vaginal prep sponges
      marketed by McKesson. The sponges may be attached to a wand that
      can be held by the hand to apply the sponge to the pudendum
      conveniently. The wand may be a plastic, paper, or wooden handle.
      The wand and sponge may be wrapped in foil or plastic that is
      removed prior to use. The dimensions of the sponge may be about 3
      cm to 8 cm by about 2 cm to 5 cm by about 1 cm to 3 cm. The sponge
      may have a raised area for gripping in the center.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Sponges on a wand could be used for external use as well as
      internal/vaginal use, particular if using a non shedding sponge
      material saturated with solution to cleanse the vagina after
      intercourse or at the tail end of menses.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Saturated cotton swabs (i.e., cotton-tipped swabs) can also
      be used to deliver the compositions described here. The size of
      the swab may be about 2×3 cm in size, for example, and may have a
      2- to 8-mm diameter applicator stick such as a 3-mm applicator
      stick. The swab may packaged in a foil pack with the swab
      preloaded with the composition. Swabs may be used, for example,
      for convenient application to the interlabial folds, and may be
      particularly useful for women that have deep folds. Cotton balls,
      textiles, foam pads, or other porous substrates may also be used,
      and may be impregnated with a composition effective for
      controlling malodor, as described herein, or may be provided with
      a container of a composition for controlling malodor, such that
      the porous substrate can receive an quantity of the composition
      and then transfer it to the pudendal region.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Spray bottles may be used, for example, for application of
      the compositions described herein for post intercourse or bowel
      movement and also for postpartum treatments after childbirth. For
      example, an accordion pleated plastic bottle could be provided
      with a tablet inside with an effervescent composition that rapidly
      dissolves when water is added. After adding water, the product
      could function like a bidet in a bottle. Such a bottle could be
      collapsed when empty for convenience storage and reuse. The “bidet
      tablets” and bottles could be provided separately (e.g., the
      tablets could be provided in a blister pack).<br>
      <br>
      [0109] In another embodiment, the compositions describes herein
      could be provided on a porous web such as a nonwoven web or paper
      web, including substrates similar to those used for dryer sheets
      in clothing care. The weblike substrate pretreated with the active
      ingredients useful for controlling fishy odor may be dry initially
      but activated with moisture, or may be provided in an emulsion or
      ointment that does not require significant moisture to become
      effective in controlling pH on the pudendum. The sheet may be
      wrapped around, placed in, or attached to a feminine pad,
      underwear or other article that is placed adjacent to the
      pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In one version, active ingredients described herein are
      applied to tissue paper marketed as toilet paper, such as a toilet
      paper for female use. In wiping, small quantities of pH
      controlling agents can be left on the pudendum to control the pH
      thereon and mitigate fishy odor or other malodors. In one related
      embodiment, “his and hers” rolls of toilet paper can be marketed
      in which the “hers” rolls are pretreated with a composition for
      delivering one or more alpha-hydroxy acids such as mandelic acid
      for use in controlling malodor arising from the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Feminine pads or wipes can also be provided that can be
      held or placed in contact with the pudendum for a short period of
      time such as about 2 hours or less, about 1 hour or less, about 30
      minutes or less, or about 10 minutes or less, such as about 10
      minutes to 60 minutes or about 15 minutes to about 45 minutes.
      Such pads or wipes may be adapted to fit into the folds of the
      pudendum to deliver active ingredients for pH control. A
      pretreated wipe may be placed on another pad or other article for
      improved contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Active ingredients in powder form may be delivered in a
      spray such as a propellant-delivered powder spray may be directed
      to spray an article such as the crotch of underwear or the
      pudendum-contacting portion of an absorbent article, or may be
      used to spray directly on the body. Propellant-free application
      using a manually operated pump may be considered, wherein air, for
      example, entrains particulates in the dry powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Tampons may also be considered. Such tampons may be
      provided with powder in the core of the tampon.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The products and methods of the present invention may also
      be adopted in combination with other known treatments, such as the
      treatments for vulvar dystrophy described in U.S. Pat. No.
      4,150,128, “Method of Treating Atrophic Vulvar Dystrophy,” issued
      Apr. 17, 1979 to Jasionowski, herein incorporated by reference to
      the extent that it is noncontradictory herewith. Jasionowski
      describes pharmaceutical formulations comprising a
      pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophilic ointment base containing a
      suspension of progesterone (Pregn-4-ene, 3,20-dione) or other
      progestins dissolved in vegetable oil is topically applied to an
      area afflicted with vulvar dystrophy. Plant estrogens, including
      those obtained from soy and black cohosh, may also be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Many alternate product formats can be considered. For
      example, the compositions of the present invention may be provided
      not only in wipes or creams, but also as vaginal suppositories to
      provide ongoing release of active ingredients for the pudendal
      area. The compositions of the present invention may also be
      applied to absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, feminine
      pads, incontinence pads, pantiliners, tampons, and the like. The
      compositions of the present invention may be delivered via wet
      wipes, wetted sponges, strips of nonwoven materials or other
      flexible materials attached to the underwear or temporarily held
      or wiped against the body, etc. The compositions may also be
      delivered by means of an aerosol spray, a non-aerosol spray such
      as a manually pumped spray bottle, a roller with a rolling head
      that delivers liquid ingredients from a liquid reservoir, a gel
      stick, and the like, including, for example, a tubular delivery
      device with a twist-click elevator mechanism in which turning of a
      lower portion of the device ratchets up an elevator that expels a
      cream or gel from an orifice on a delivery head for application to
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The feminine treatment composition may be applied in a
      variety of means to deliver active ingredients to the exterior
      surface of the user. These delivery means may include feminine
      pads (a term intended to comprise sanitary napkins, pantiliners,
      thong liners, and a variety of menstrual pads and incontinence
      products). The delivery means may also comprise wipes,
      particularly wet wipes, that are used to deliver active
      ingredients in a formulation to the exterior body of the user in
      the pudendum or adjacent regions. Moist or pretreated liners may
      also be placed in contact with the body for a period of time,
      similar to or in conjunction with the use of feminine pads (e.g.,
      pantiliners). These may be applied during the day, including
      throughout the day or for brief periods of time, such as for 1
      minute or longer, 5 minutes or longer, or 20 minutes or longer,
      including, for example from 10 minutes to 12 hours, from 1 hour to
      6 hours, or for about 1 hour to 24 hours, or less than about any
      of the following: 24 hours, 6 hours, 2 hours, 1 hours, 10 minutes,
      5 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, or 15 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The feminine treatment composition may be generally applied
      in any known form such as in the form of a spray or a viscous
      formulation for application by means other than conventional
      spraying. Such a viscous formulation may comprise a cream
      (generally understood to comprise an emulsion such as an oil/water
      emulsion, including oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions) such
      as those that may be described as a moisturizer, lotion, liniment,
      ointment, salve, etc. The viscous formulation may also appear to
      be a jelly, including a single-phase or multi-phase viscous fluid
      such as a gel optionally displaying viscoelasticity. The viscous
      formulation may be characterized by being flowable under shear
      stress, but may have a yield stress such that at very low shear
      stress levels, the formulation substantially does not flow. In
      some cases, the yield stress may be sufficiently high such that a
      quantity of the viscous formulation at room temperature (22° C.)
      maybe applied to a substantially vertical section of human skin
      without immediately and noticeably flowing under the influence of
      gravity alone (specifically, the quantity may be sufficient to
      coat a 3 cm diameter circular section of dry, glabrous skin such
      as skin on the upper thigh to a depth of about 2 mm without
      visible migration of the viscous formulation after 3 minutes of
      gravitation pull while the skin is held substantially still in a
      vertical orientation). The viscous formulation may also comprise a
      substantial quantity of void space or gaseous bubbles and may be
      in the form of a foam, a multiphase gel, etc. The formulation may
      also be provided as a solid or semisolid material such as a
      soluble polymeric film or other film capable of releasing active
      ingredients in use, including films comprising slow-release
      polymeric substrates. Slow-release polymers for releasing active
      ingredients may be used in any other known form as well. The
      formulation may also be provided as a wash, as a douche product,
      as a suppository, as a coating, liquid, vaginal capsule, vaginal
      tablet, vaginal film, vaginal sponge, vaginal ovule, etc.,
      provided that it is adapted to release active ingredients to the
      exterior skin of the user. The formulation may also be applied to
      a vaginal insert, tampon, wipe or pad, and then administered to
      the vagina, provided that active ingredients can be delivered
      therefrom to the exterior surfaces of the body adjacent the
      vagina.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] For formulations comprising gels, although a variety of
      compounds may be employed, water is usually employed as the
      dispersion medium for the gel to optimize biocompatibility. Other
      possible dispersion mediums include non-aqueous solvents,
      including glycols, such as propylene glycol, butylene glycol,
      triethylene glycol, hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycols,
      ethoxydiglycol, and dipropyleneglycol; alcohols, such as ethanol,
      n-propanol, and isopropanol; triglycerides; ethyl acetate;
      acetone; triacetin; and combinations thereof. Typically, the
      dispersion medium (e.g., water) constitutes greater than about 75
      wt/vol %, in some embodiments greater than about 90 wt/vol %, and
      in some embodiments, from about 95 wt/vol % to about 99 wt/vol %
      of the vaginal treatment composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The disperse phase of the gel may be formed from any of a
      variety of different gelling agents, including temperature
      responsive (“thermogelling”) compounds, ion responsive compounds,
      and so forth. Thermogelling systems, for instance, respond to a
      change in temperature (e.g., increase in temperature) by changing
      from a liquid to a gel. Generally speaking, the temperature range
      of interest is from about 25.degree. C. and 40.degree. C., in some
      embodiments from about 35.degree. C. and 39.degree. C., and in one
      particular embodiment, at the human body temperature (about
      37.degree. C.). Compositions that change state at about this
      temperature are useful because they will remain in a body cavity,
      for example, after they have been delivered. Any of a variety of
      thermogelling compounds that are capable of gelling when applied
      to the vagina may be used in the present invention. In some cases,
      thermogelling block copolymers, graft copolymers, and/or
      homopolymers may be employed. For example, polyoxyalkylene block
      copolymers may be used in some embodiments of the present
      invention to form a thermo-gelling composition. The term
      “polyoxyalkylene block copolymers” refers to copolymers of
      alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, which
      form a gel when dispersed in water in a sufficient concentration.
      Some suitable polyoxyalkylene block copolymers include
      polyoxybutylene block copolymers and
      polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers (“EO/PO” block
      copolymers), such as described in U.S. Patent Application
      Publication No. 2003/0204180 to Huang, et al., which is
      incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto for all
      purposes. For instance, exemplary polyoxyalkylene block copolymers
      include polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers (EO/PO
      block copolymers), etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Any suitable gelling agent, including gellan and other
      polymers and polysaccharides, may be used, including those
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,619,008, “Xylitol for Treatment of
      Vaginal Infections,” issued Nov. 17, 2009 to Yang et al., herein
      incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preservatives and Antimicrobial Agents</b><br>
      <br>
      [0121] Additional preservatives or antimicrobial agents may be
      provided in the formulations and systems described herein. Such
      agents may include cetylpyridinium chloride, parabens e.g.,
      (methyl paraben, ethyl paraben), imidazolidinyl urea, propyl
      benzoate, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and the like. Other
      antimicrobial or bacteriostatic agents that may be considered
      include, by way of example only, biguanide, chitosan derivatives,
      silver nanoparticles or other silver-based compositions and
      products capable of releasing silver ions, and the like. Nisin, a
      polycyclic peptide antibacterial agent, may also be incorporated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rheology Modifying Ingredients</b><br>
      <br>
      [0122] Many known rheology modifiers can be considered to obtain
      desired properties, particularly the bioadhesive properties of
      some embodiments. Gums such as guar gum or xanthan gum or other
      industrial gums, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates,
      cellulose-derived polymers such as carboxymethylcellise or
      hydroxyalkylcellulose polymers, Laponite, clays, carboxomer
      polymers, and numerous other compounds can be considered. Silicone
      elastomers can be considered, including those described in U.S.
      Ser. No. 09/613,266 (P&amp;G).<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Known bioadhesive polymers may be used as part of the
      carrier system, including polyolprepolymers from Barnet Products
      Group (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.) and related compounds such as
      Barnet's Topicare® Delivery Compounds and related liquid polymers.
      Barnet's polyolprepolymers are polyalkalene glycol-based
      polyurethane polymers suitable for use as skin care agents that
      can hold active ingredients on the surface of the skin. They do
      not absorb substantially into the skin and can remain in place for
      a prolonged period of time, being capable of forming a liquid
      reservoir on the skin. Specific products include
      polyolprepolymer-2 (PP-2), polyolprepolymer-14 (PP-14), and
      polyolprepolymer-15 (PP-15). PP-2 is a lipophilic mixture of
      liquid hydroxy-terminated polymers in polypropylene glycol having
      oligomers with a molecular weight range of 1,500 to 10,000 and an
      average molecular weight of about 4,000 and an HLB in the range of
      12-14. At 35° C., it has a reported viscosity of about 2500 to
      4000 cps. PP-14 is similar but has a higher molecular weight of
      about 18,000 and is more lipophilic. It has an HLB of about 11-13.
      At 35° C., it has a reported viscosity of about 2500 to 6000 cps.
      PP-15 is a mixture of liquid hydroxy-terminated polymers in
      polyethylene glycol. It has a molecular weight of about 1,800 and
      is soluble in water and alcohol and can be used in aqueous systems
      with hydrophilic components. At 35° C., it has a reported
      viscosity of about 2500 to 5000 cps.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The aforementioned polyolprepolymers are believed to be
      particularly useful in enhancing the efficacy of active
      ingredients such as alpha-hydroxy acids by holding them on the
      epidermis level and reducing irritation.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Bioadhesive materials useful for some of the embodiments
      described herein may include those discussed in U.S. Pat. No.
      6,479,045, “Vaginal pH Buffering for Preventing Miscarriage and
      Premature Labor, by Treating or Preventing Bacterial Vaginosis,”
      published Nov. 12, 2002 by Bologna et al. The Bologna patent
      discusses water-insoluble but water-swellable cross-linked
      polycarboxylic acid polymers that may be used in vaginal
      treatments. For some versions of the present materials and
      methods, the bioadhesives may be modified to comprise suitable
      alpha hydroxy acids and other agents, and then marketed as a
      solution for the problem of fishy odor by application to the
      pudendum as opposed to the vagina.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Skin Benefit Agents</b><br>
      <br>
      [0126] Non-limiting examples of skin benefit agents that may be
      considered for use herein are described in The CTFA Cosmetic
      Ingredient Handbook, 2nd Edition (1992), which includes a wide
      variety of ingredients commonly used in the skin care industry,
      and which may be suitable for use in various embodiments of the
      present invention. Non-limiting examples of skin benefit agents
      include absorbents, aesthetic components such as fragrances,
      pigments, natural extractives such as witch hazel or aloe vera,
      colorings/colorants, essential oils, skin sensates, astringents,
      etc. (e.g., clove oil, menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, eugenol,
      menthyl lactate, witch hazel distillate), anti-caking agents,
      antimicrobial agents (e.g., iodopropyl butylcarbamate),
      antioxidants, colorants, cosmetic astringents, cosmetic biocides,
      drug astringents, external analgesics, opacifying agents, pH
      adjusters, skin-conditioning and/or moisturizing agents, i.e.
      glycerine, skin soothing and/or healing agents (e.g., panthenol
      and derivatives (e.g., ethyl panthenol), pantothenic acid and its
      derivatives, allantoin, bisabolol, and dipotassium
      glycyrrhizinate), retinoids, (e.g. retinol palmitate), tocopheryl
      nicotinate, skin treating agents, vitamins and derivatives
      thereof. It is to be understood that the actives useful herein can
      in some instances provide more than one benefit or operate via
      more than one mode of action. Therefore, classifications herein
      are made for the sake of convenience and are not intended to limit
      the active to that particular application or applications listed.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Moisturizers may include urea, which may also be used in
      combination with lactic acid for effective moisturizing activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Foam Embodiments</b><br>
      <br>
      [0128] In some embodiments, the active ingredients are delivered
      to the body while in a foam state, such as stable foam, for
      example, that is produced with or without a propellant. In some
      versions, a foam is dispensed from a dispenser such as a
      propellant-free dispenser with pumping action to create the foam
      from a composition in a foamable carrier, and then applied to a
      wipe or other substrate, or applied to the hand of the user or
      otherwise delivered to the pudendum. Propellant-driving foam
      generators may also be used to deliver the composition as a foam.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Active ingredients in a foam may be dispensed for
      subsequent placement on a dry wipe, a pre-moistened wipe, or other
      soft, flexible applicator (e.g., an object about 3-fingers wide or
      4 to 10 cm wide) or a finger condom wipe or other object to used
      for application of the foam-based composition to the pudendum. The
      foam can be a non-propellant foam. A foam with a suitable
      stiffness of yield stress can be applied to the pudendum in any
      manner of methods for sustained body adherence.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Examples of foam-based systems are described in U.S. Pat.
      No. 6,818,204, “Stable Foam for Use in Disposable Wipe,” issued to
      Lapidus on Nov. 16, 2004, herein incorporated by reference to the
      extent that it is noncontradictory herewith. The Lapidus patent,
      whose teachings may be adapted for use with the present products
      and processes, discusses the use of compatible surfactants, e.g.,
      nonionic, anionic, amphoteric, for use in human hygienic products.
      The surfactant should be capable of forming a foam when mixed with
      air in a finger actuated, mechanical pump foamer. Such surfactants
      are said to include, without limitation, those which do not
      irritate mucous membranes such as polyethylene 20 cetyl ether
      (Brij 58)™, a nonionic surfactant; sodium lauroyl sarcosinate
      (Hamposyl L-30)™, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate (Lathanol LAL)™ and
      sodium laureth sulfate (Sipon ESY)™—anionic surfactants;
      lauramidopropyl betaine (Monateric LMAB™), an amphoteric
      surfactant, as well as polysorbate 20, TEA-cocoyl glutamate,
      disodium cocoamphodiacetate and combinations thereof. Typically,
      the surfactant is said to present in an amount from about 2% to
      about 35% by weight, or from about 5% to about 15% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] At least one foam stabilizing agent may also be present in
      certain foamable embodiments. Suitable foam stabilizing agents may
      include, without limitation, natural or synthetic gums such as
      xanthan gum, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol,
      alkylene polyols such as glycerine and propylene glycol and
      combinations thereof. Typically, the foam stabilizers may be
      present in an amount from about 0.10% to about 5%, or from about
      2% to about 4%.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] A suitable foamer, by way of example, is the F2 Finger Pump
      Foamer™ made by AirSpray. Details of exemplary propellantless
      defoamers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,569, issued on Aug.
      22, 1995, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,576, issued Sep. 29, 1998,
      herein incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Ingredients</b><br>
      <br>
      [0133] Many other ingredients may be used in the formulation
      provided they are not antagonistic to the intended function of the
      product. Such ingredients may include chelating agents such as
      EDTA, fragrances, viscosity modifiers, colors, opacifiers such as
      titanium oxide, sensory agents such as menthol or other known
      agents capable of producing a cooling or warming sensation on the
      skin; essential oils, fatty acids, proteins including various
      enzymes; probiotic agents to enhance growth of lactobaccili or
      other desirable bacteria, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Humectants and solubilizers may be used, such as butylene
      glycol.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] In various embodiments, the formulation may be
      substantially free of any or all of the following: ethanol,
      methanol, propanol, alcohols, alcohols having 3 our fewer carbons,
      alcohols having 2 or fewer carbons, glycolic acid, acetic acid,
      critic acid, latex, spermicides, Octoxynol-9, TEA (triethylamine,
      a compound which may contribute to unwanted odor) or derivatives
      of TEA, TMA (trimethylamine), ammonia or complexes thereof,
      amines, protein, polyhydroxy fatty acids, polyhydroxy acids,
      alpha-hydroxy acids having 14 or greater carbons, fatty acids,
      polyhydroxy fatty acid esters (or polyhydroxy fatty acid
      derivatives such as esters, amides, and alcohols), benzoic acid,
      preservatives, perfumes, artificial colors, sodium bicarbonate,
      bicarbonates in solid or ionic form, retinol, or Retin-A.
      “Substantially free” in this context may mean lacking an effective
      quantity. For alcohols and acids this may be taken as less than
      0.1%. In some cases, the concentration may be less than 0.05%.
      Xylitol or other 5-carbon sugars may be used to enhance the
      antimicrobial benefits of the composition. See U.S. Pat. No.
      7,619,008, issued Nov. 17, 2009 to Yang et al.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The composition may be substantially free of aluminum,
      aluminum salts, or other aluminum compounds, such as having less
      than 1%, less than 0.5%, less than 0.1%, or less than 0.01% of
      aluminum (e.g., aluminum ions). The composition may be
      substantially free of zirconium, such as having less than 1%, less
      than 0.5%, less than 0.1%, or less than 0.01% of zirconium (e.g.,
      zirconium ions). In general, the composition may be substantially
      free of effective amounts of aluminum and zirconium antiperspirant
      compounds.<br>

      [0137] U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,437, “Wet Wipes Having Skin Health
      Benefits,” issued Aug. 27, 2002 to Krzysik et al., herein
      incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith, describes a soft wet wipe or wipe-type
      product, such as a baby wipe, an adult wipe, hand wipe, a face
      wipe, a cosmetic wipe, a household wipe, an industrial wipe, a
      personal cleansing wipe, cotton balls, cotton tipped swabs, and
      the like, that can be made by combining the wipe or wipe-type
      product with an oil-in-water emulsion composition comprising a
      natural fat or oil, sterol or sterol derivative, humectant,
      emulsifying surfactant, and water. Krzysik discuss a wet wipe or
      wipe-type product with an oil-in-water emulsion composition
      comprising a natural fat or oil, sterol or sterol derivative,
      humectant, emulsifying surfactants and surfactant combinations
      having an HLB range of about 7 to about 18, and water. The
      composition is said to readily transfer from the wet wipe to the
      skin to provide enhanced skin barrier benefits. The natural fat or
      oil used in the composition may include borage oil, avocado oil,
      or sunflower oil. The humectant used in the composition may
      include glycerin, sorbitol, or propylene glycol. The emulsifying
      surfactant used in the composition may include glyceryl stearate
      SE, emulsifying wax NF, or propylene glycol oleate SE. The
      composition may further comprise from about 0.1 to about 30% by
      weight petrolatum or mineral oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The lists of fats and oils, fatty acids, fatty alcohols,
      essential oils, and emulsifying surfactants of Krzysik (U.S. Pat.
      No. 6,440,437) are in particular incorporated herein by reference
      and may be used for various embodiments herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Suitable humectants may include, but are not limited to,
      the following materials: acetamide MEA, Aloe Vera Gel, arginine
      PCA, chitosan PCA, copper PCA, corn glycerides, dimethyl
      imidazolidinone, fructose, glucamine, glucose, glucose glutamate,
      glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, glycereth-7, glycereth-12,
      glycereth-20, glycereth-26, glycerin, honey, hydrogenated honey,
      hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, hydrolyzed corn starch, lactamide
      MEA, lactic acid, lactose lysine PCA, mannitol, methyl gluceth-10,
      methyl gluceth-20, PCA, PEG-2 lactamide, PEG-10 propylene glycol,

      TEA-Lactate, TEA-PCA, urea, xylitol, and the like, as well as
      mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Non-ionic silicone surfactants may also be used, according
      to US20070141127, “Wet Wipes with Natural Antimicrobial Agents,”
      herein incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith. Suitable natural antimicrobial agents
      discussed therein may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,426 to Krzysik et al., herein
      incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith, describes a lotion formula that can be
      applied to a tissue which will remain available for transfer to
      the user's skin to reduce skin irritation and redness. The lotion
      composition includes from about 30 to about 90% by weight of oil,
      from about 10 to about 40% by weight wax, and from about 5 to
      about 40% by weight of a fatty alcohol. The melting point of the
      lotion composition is from about 30° C. to about 70° C. The
      formulation was pre-melted at about 56° C. and the press supply
      system (supply hose, doctor application head, and gravure roll)
      was pre-heated to about 50° C. The deposit solidified almost
      instantaneously on the surface of the treated tissue. Such a
      system can be adapted for versions of the present system to apply
      a lotion to a tissue, a wipe, a topsheet, or other suitable
      surface for subsequent transfer to the skin of a user.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] In general, whether applied from a treatment on an
      absorbent article, from a wipe of any kind, by a spray, sponge,
      pads, by the fingers, or by any other means, the formulation may
      have the characteristics of a semi-solid at both 20° C. and at 37°
      C. (normal internal body temperature). For example, at 20° C., the
      portion of the formulation that is liquid may be from about 2% to
      about 60% by weight, or from about 5% to about 50% by weight, or
      from about 5% to about 30% by weight. Upon heating to 37° C., the
      liquid fraction may be from about 5% to about 80%, or from about
      10% to about 75%, or from about 15% to about 70%, which may, for
      example, represent an increase in the relative amount of liquid
      present, wherein the ratio of the liquid weight percent at 37° C.
      to the liquid weight percent at 20° C. may be greater than 1,
      greater than 1.05, greater than 1.1, or greater than 1.2, such as
      from 1.05 to about 20, from 1.05 to about 10, from 1.05 to 6, or
      from 1.20 to 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] In one version, the formulation may have substantially
      liquid properties at room temperature prior to being applied to a
      substrate. U.S. Pat. No. 7,169,400, “Waterless Lotion and
      Lotion-Treated Substrate,” issued Jan. 30, 2007 to Luu et al.,
      herein incorporated by reference to the extent that it is
      noncontradictory herewith, describes lotion compositions that are
      substantially liquid at room temperature (defined by Luu et al. as
      being from 20° C. to 25° C.) but which become semi-solid or
      substantially more viscous after application to a substrate such
      as a cellulosic or other polymeric web as a component of the
      composition is absorbed by the substrate. In one version, Luu et
      al. describe a lotion including a micro-emulsion, which comprises
      a polar emollient, a non-polar emollient, a non-ionic surfactant,
      and a co-surfactant wherein at least one of the emollients has
      substantial solubility in either cellulosic or synthetic fiber.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Non-polar emollients may include an aromatic or linear
      ester, Guerbet ester, mineral oil, squalane, squalene, liquid
      paraffin and the like. The polar or non-polar emollient is either
      in the continuous outer phase or in the discontinuous internal
      phase of the micro-emulsion. Non-ionic surfactants may include
      PEG-20 methyl glucose sesquistearate, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether,
      PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, PEG-20 methyl glucose
      distearate, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, ethoxylated methyl
      glucose having from about 10 to about 20 repeating ethoxy units,
      and the like. The lotion may comprise, for example, at least 10° A
      polyalkoxy or polyhydroxy emollient; an aromatic ester, such as
      C12 to C15 alkyl benzoate ester or mineral oil; and may further
      comprise myristyl alcohol and, for example, PEG-20 methylglucose
      sesquistearate. Such lotions may be adapted for use with other
      formulations described herein and may, for example, further
      comprise mandelic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The formulation may also comprise a plurality of other
      acidifying agents such as acetic acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic
      acid, and the like. Known medicaments may also be included, such
      as compositions in pharmaceutically effective concentrations for
      treating infections, skin disorders, and other health conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Packaging and Dispensing</b><br>
      <br>
      [0146] Products made according to any of the embodiments of the
      present invention may be packaged and/or dispensed in any known
      way suitable for any particular product format. Wet wipes, for
      example, may be packaged in perforated rolls contained within
      flexible pouches or rigid dispensers of any kind. Wipes may also
      be cut and folded into known configurations such as C-folds,
      L-folds, M-folds, quarter folds, and the like, for dispensing
      wipes from various known containers. In some embodiments, each
      individual wet wipe is arranged in a folded configuration and
      stacked one on top of the other to provide a stack of wet wipes.
      The stack of folded wet wipes may be placed in the interior of a
      container, such as a plastic tub, to provide a package of wet
      wipes for eventual sale to the consumer. Alternatively, the wet
      wipes may include a continuous strip of material which has
      perforations between each wipe and which may be arranged in a
      stack or wound into a roll for dispensing.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] Wipes or absorbent articles used within the scope of the
      present invention may be packaged using any known wrapper, pouch,
      casing, or other packaging system, such as those described in U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,010,001, “Individual Packaging for Hygienic Wiping,”
      issued Jan. 4, 2000 to Osborn; U.S. Pat. No. 3,062,371,
      “Internally Sterile Composite Package,” issued to D. Patience on
      Nov. 6, 1962; U.S. Pat. No. 3,698,549, “Packages for Small
      Articles,” issued to J. A. Glassman on Oct. 17, 1972; all of which
      herein incorporated by reference to the extent that they are
      noncontradictory herewith. Systems that may be adapted for use
      with the present invention include U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,059, issued
      Jan. 19, 1993, which describes packaging that protects the user's
      hands during application.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Wipes and other products may be provided in sterile heat
      sealable pouches. Sterilization may be provided by gamma
      irradiation, microwave radiation, e-beam radiation, ultraviolet
      light, steam autoclaving, ethylene oxide treatment, etc. Pouches
      may comprise foil, foil laminates, polymeric films, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] Wipes may also be dispensed from sealable jars such as
      glass or plastic jars or other resilient containers. Any known dry
      or wet wipe container may also be considered, including resilient
      plastic tubs with openings for dispensing of wipes in a pop-up
      manner, such as Cottonelle® wipes from Kimberly-Clark Corp.
      (Dallas, Tex.).<br>
      <br>
      [0150] In one version, wipes may be co-packaged with single-use
      dispensers of a formulation in the form of a lotion, cream, or
      solution, wherein a cardboard or plastic container for wipes
      (e.g., a rectangular container holding plurality of wipes) is
      connected to a lid element by a hinge, in which the underside of
      the lid contains a plurality of single-use formulation containers
      such as pouches that can be opened by squeezing or tearing. The
      single-use formulation containers may be held by a pocket on the
      underside of the lid element, allowing them to be visible when the
      lid element is placed in an upright or open position, allowing
      both the wipes and the single-use containers to be visible and
      readily selected and taken by a user, as desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Directions for Use</b><br>
      <br>
      [0151] Inidicia placed on or otherwise associated with packaging
      may inform users of the benefits of the product, call attention to
      the relationship between fishy odor and the non-pathological
      environment of the pudendum, provide information about the
      importance of maintaining the right pH in that region, and give
      instructions for use. Instructions for use may include, by way of
      example, information similar to the following:<br>
      <br>
      [0152] “Directions for use. For best product performance, after
      showering, blow dry your bottom on a low warm setting until skin
      is dry. Apply the cream to the folds between your labia, up onto
      your clitoral hood, perineum and between your buttocks including
      the area around your anus.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] “For best results, use the wipe to cleanse the areas of
      your bottom after urination, bowel movements, intercourse and
      rigorous activity. Reapply the cream if needed for added
      protection especially after showering.”<br>
      <br>
      [0154] Indicia may be placed on the packaging material holding a
      container of a composition such as an outer cardboard box, or may
      be placed on the container that directly holds the composition
      (e.g., a squeezable tube, a plastic or glass jar, a spray bottle,
      a foam dispenser, a tube of wipes, etc.). Alternatively or in
      addition, instructions for use may be associated with the product
      in a variety of ways other that directly printing on a package.
      The instructions may be provided on printed material that is
      distributed with the product but physically detached therefrom, or
      may be on a website or other information source that is associated
      with the product (e.g., accessible via a QR code, barcode, RFID
      tag, or URL printed on the package). Information about the product
      and its use may also be approved in promotional media such as in
      television commercials promoting the product. Such information may
      point to the surprising discovery that many cases of fishy odor
      are not due to pathological conditions in the vagina but are a
      result of proximity of sources of anaerobic bacteria to the
      pudendum coupled with pH lowering conditions, calling for care in
      maintaining a suitable pH in the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Regions of the body likely to experience unwanted body odor
      associated with perspiration include regions with apocrine sweat
      glands such as the underarms region and the groin or pudendum, and
      may also include other regions such as the chest, under the
      breasts, the back, the feet, the scalp, and so forth. Such regions
      may be identified in indicia (not shown) associated with various
      products based on selected embodiments of the present invention.
      Areas where body odor from sweat may be less likely include the
      face or facial skin, the forearms, the hands (especially the back
      of the hands), and the neck. In some embodiments, application of
      the deodorant composition to the face may be specifically
      proscribed (especially to skin near the eyes, nose, or mouth). The
      same may apply for the back of the hands and the exposed neck.
      Thus, indicia may indicate that the product should be used in the
      underarm region or other regions likely to have body odor
      associated with perspiration, and that the product should not be
      used on the face or neck (or the head in general, if desired), or
      on the hands.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Further Details</b><br>
      <br>
      [0156] Caffeine or related xanthines may be provided as pure
      substances, as phytoextracts, or in combination with other useful
      ingredients, and then blended with other suitable ingredients for
      the desired product form to give an antideodorant or
      antiperspirant product. In some embodiments, the sweat inhibitory
      effect of caffeine or related xanthines is enhanced with
      antimicrobial benefits from carboxylic acids, particularly
      alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids such as mandelic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] References to caffeine or any other xanthine are understood
      to include salts thereof. Thus, caffeine citrate is understood to
      fall within the scope of caffeine, although for purposes of
      computing the weight percent of caffeine when a caffeine salt is
      present, the mass of the salt should be normalize to the effective
      mass of pure caffeine that would be present if the caffeine were
      not in salt form. The same principle applies to other xanthines as
      well.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Formulation may be achieved by any known means for
      preparing a composition of a desired format (e.g., cream, roll-on,
      spray, etc.). This may include heating, agitating, homogenizing,
      pressurized extrusion, and the like, with batch, continuous, or
      semi-continuous processing all being within the scope of the
      methods for various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0159] A viscous cream comprising lactic acid, mandelic acid, and
      an oil/water emulsion carrier was formulated using the following
      ingredients:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Water<br>
      &nbsp;Lactic acid 8.0%<br>
      &nbsp;<b>Mandelic acid 4.0%</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Glycerin</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Xanthan gum thickener</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Polyquaternium 10</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Aloe vera extract</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Oat extract</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Allantoin</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Chamomile extract</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Sodium hydroxide</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Methylisothiazolinone (preservative)</b><br>
      <b>&nbsp; Capryl glycol</b><br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; The pH of the formulation was 4.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] This formulation was then tested with female subjects using
      an external test agency. Seventeen product summaries were
      collected from test subjects. The summaries are formatted on a 5
      point scale with 5 being the most favorable to 1 being the least.
      The product was evaluated on the properties as follows, texture,
      feel after applied to the skin, irritability to the application
      area, reduction or blocked odor, how well the women liked the
      product and whether or not they would use the product again or
      recommend it to a friend. Most of the women fell between the ages
      of 20-50 with the exception on both extremes, the youngest being
      nineteen and the oldest aged sixty-five. One women was pregnant in
      her third trimester.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Each of 5 parameters are separately considered. All 17 gave
      the product a 5/5 rating in terms of texture and consistency.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] The product was not irritating to the area of application.
      Thirteen of the 17 (76%). gave it a 5/5. Three of the 17 gave it a
      4/5 or 18%. Combined 4-5/5 rating is 16/17 or 94%. One woman gave
      it a 3/5 rating and then explained that she had stinging upon
      initial application that went away quickly. She stated that
      overall the product worked and she would buy the product and use
      in the future. A point was made by several women that they had a
      warming sensation upon initial application that they felt meant it
      was working or one woman verbalized that it felt like K-Y warming
      gel. None of the women felt that this was a negative. Some said
      that they felt that it must be working.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] The product reduced or blocked odor. Thirteen of the 17
      (76%) gave the product a 5/5 rating for odor reduction. Three of
      the 17 gave a 4/5 or 18%. Combined rating of 4-5/5 is 16/17 or
      94%. Of the women who gave a 4/5 in this category, there were no
      additional comments about why they felt it was less than a 5. One
      woman gave the product a 3/5. She said that it only made her feel
      more wet and she did not like the product. Others stated that they
      felt that the product helped with odor during menses, after
      intercourse or after working out.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] For overall approval of the product, fourteen of the 17
      (82%) gave it 5/5. One woman gave it a 4/5. Combined rating of
      4-5/5 is 15/17 or 88%. One woman gave it a 2/5. (the one who did
      not like the product because it made her feel more wet). The same
      positive numbers were obtained when the subjects were asked if
      they would use this product again and recommend it to others.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0165] Another version of a viscous cream was made with the
      following ingredients:<br>

      <b>[0167] Procedures:</b><br>
      <br>
      1. In a clean sanitized stainless steel tank, Sequence 1
      ingredients were combined and mixed thoroughly to form a first
      mixture.<br>
      2. The first mixture was heated to 75° C. while mixing continued.<br>
      3. In a separate stainless steel tank, Sequence 2 ingredients were
      combined and heated to 75° C. to form a second mixture.<br>
      4. After slight cooling, when both mixtures were at 70° C., the
      second mixture was added gradually to the first mixture while
      mixing. Mixing continued for another 15 minutes to form a third
      mixture.<br>
      5. A cooling cycle was then started as the third mixture was
      cooled to 40° C. Then the Sequence 3 ingredients were added one at
      time in the listed order while mixing to form a fourth mixture.<br>
      6. The ingredients from Sequence 4 were then blended into the
      fourth mixture to form the final composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] The final composition had a pH less than 4 and was then
      tested for efficacy in terms of preventing malodor. Relative to
      similar compositions without the PP-12 prepolymer (PPG-12), the
      composition was found to be surprisingly effective in preventing
      fishy odor from the pudendum, with a prolonged effect lasting over
      24 hours. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed
      that the prepolymer compound assists in holding the alpha-hydroxy
      acids of the composition off the skin and in an environment where
      they can be effective in maintaining a low pH and reducing the
      activity of anaerobic bacteria on the pudendum.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] The product apparently not only diminishes existing odor on
      contact, but has a lasting effect that is believed to due at least
      in part to the combination of alpha-hydroxy acids in a lipophilic
      carriers. In a formulation without the prepolymer, the efficacy on
      the pudendum was estimated to have a duration of about 6 to 8
      hours, such that fishy odor was substantially reduced or prevented
      after application, but would begin to return after about 8 hours.
      With a change in formulation to include the prepolymer from
      Barnet, the lasting odor control exceeded expectations and lasted
      upwards of 24 hours. Another surprise was the observation of an
      apparent cumulative effect with daily use over time, such that the
      interval required before the return of malodor could be detected
      increased significant over time beyond what was expected based on
      experience with related formulations without the prepolymer. In
      particular, the interval of time before the return of fishy odor
      after activities like intercourse, menses, and exercise and
      leaking urine was extended significantly and the intensity of the
      fishy odor when it did return appeared to be significantly less
      than expected as well. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it
      may be that the bacterial load is well controlled on the pudendum
      long after application of the product, and thus the amount of
      “work” to be done by reapplication of the product is lessened with
      regular use...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7</b><br>
      <br>
      [0199] A cream was formulated with a microsponge caffeine product
      for controlled released. Multiple product batches were made with
      the following target composition:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mandelic acid 4-6%</b><br>
      <b>Caffeine powder 3.0% (CapsuDar® Caffeine 85, a
        microencapsulated caffeine powder coated with cellulose
        derivative, marketed by LycoRed Bio Ltd. of Yavne, Israel).</b><br>
      <b>Corn starch</b><br>
      <b>Trichlosan</b><br>
      <b>PP2 2.0% (Barnet Products Group, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.)</b><br>
      <b>Aloe vera &amp; chamomile</b><br>
      <b>Tea tree oil</b><br>
      <b>Other ingredients:</b><br>
      <b>Veg, glycerin</b><br>
      <b>Glyceryl stearate</b><br>
      <b>Cetyl alcohol</b><br>
      <b>Dimethicone</b><br>
      <b>Caprylic/Capric triglyceride</b><br>
      <b>Emulsifying wax</b><br>
      <b>Sodium hydroxide to PH 4.50</b><br>
      <b>Cucumber fragrance</b><br>
      <br>
      [0216] The cream was tested on several human users, using manual
      application to the underarm region and other areas as desired,
      with excellent results in controlling odor and reducing
      perspiration. Long-lasting odor control was observed, with several
      users indicating that successful antiperspirant performance
      increased initially as if the product performance was cumulative.
      With a week of daily use, significant reduction on odor was
      observed. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it may be that
      the cumulative effect over time is to substantially reduce the
      amount of odor-producing bacteria on the skin. The composition was
      also found to be effective in keeping body odor out of clothing
      also.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] Users of this and related compositions observed that the
      skin felt smoother and was easier to shave, with less irritation.
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the
      alpha-hydroxy acids in this and related compositions act to smooth
      the skin and to soften hair, allowing shaving with less
      irritation.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] This formulation appeared to work best if applied when the
      skin was dry...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><br>
      <br>
      [0221] In a prophetic example, 1% or greater caffeine by weight or
      other effective quantity of xanthine compounds are added to the
      caffeine-free formulations of Examples 1 through 6 to create a
      compound with the benefits of both xanthine compounds relative to
      sweat reduction and alpha-hydroxy acids relative to odor
      suppression. The product can then be formulated for application
      via a sponge or wipe, or may be provided as a roll-on deodorant, a
      spray-on deodorant, or a nonwoven or other absorbent pad that is
      worn in contact with a region of the body suffering from malodor
      such as the pudendum, wherein the absorbent pad that delivers an
      effective amount of the formulation to the skin to reduce malodor
      from perspiration...<br>
