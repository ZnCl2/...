      </div>
      <b><br>
        Electricity is not only a force, but a substance; Amperage is
        the substance ( infinitely small eddies of force ), and Voltage
        is the speed.<br>
        <br>
        The Odic Ray changes the weight of metal... explodes hard
        clay... makes rock transparent... penetrates lead to take
        photographs... application to metal renders it permanently
        cold... decomposes water to H &amp; O...<br>
        <br>
        There are 3 phases in all forces: Dominant Third, Negative, and
        Dominant or Solar at definite distances apart in speed. Their
        relationship is 3:6:9.<br>
        <br>
        All forces actually are two forces in one : rectilinear and
        rotating.<br>
        <br>
        The rotational force can be broken and released. This is called
        "Odic Activity".<br>
        <br>
        The rate of Odic Activity can be changed, its polarity can be
        reversed, and the direction of its discharge can be controlled.<br>
        <br>
        The only difference between one ray and another is in speed, and
        possibly in polarity or character. The Odic Ray can be altered
        to duplicate any known rays or rate of force known, such as
        light, X-rays, UV rays, etc.<br>
        <br>
        Physical weight depends on the speed of rotation of substance
        particles, which resists the force of gravity. The Odic Ray can
        reduce or increase the speed of substance rotation, thus
        decreasing or increasing its weight reversibly. Thus the weight
        of objects depends upon atomic forces, not physical properties.<br>
        <br>
        The methods used by Ernst W. Keely would seem to apply here.
        Nikola Tesla also praised the 3:6:9 ratio...<br>

            “Odic Ray”? </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      DISCOVERY of “odic rays” of high penetration produced simply by
      the electric current drawn from an ordinary light socket, and yet
      with the curative and medicinal value of X-rays, is claimed by Dr.
      Edgar L. Hollingshead, of Pasadena, Calif.<br>
      <br>
      With simple, inexpensive apparatus he is reported to have passed
      rays through 11-1/2 inches of lead and 4-1/2 inches of steel, at
      such strength as to sear dental X-ray films encased in tinfoil.<br>
      <br>
      Such an achievement appears impossible; yet X-rays seemed equally
      impossible when Rontgen first announced their discovery. Doctor
      Hollingshead’s claims are based on tests made in the presence of
      eyewitnesses who selected at random the films exposed to the rays,
      retained the duplicates, and developed the two simultaneously in
      the presence of an unprejudiced committee. After exposure, these
      films were found to be perceptibly darkened.<br>
      <br>
      Doctor Hollingshead declares that the rays produced try his
      apparatus are of greater intensity and penetration than any
      previously known to science. The rate of vibration of the “odic
      rays” can be controlled by the operator, it is asserted. If these
      claims are substantiated, the value of the discovery to the world
      will be enormous. The medical profession will have an unlimited
      supply of curative rays. The X-ray diagnosis can be utilized by
      every doctor in the country, since the apparatus can readily be
      carried from house to house. The doctor has given a partial
      explanation of his ray.<br>
      <br>
      He has found, he says, that electricity is not simply a force, but
      a substance. Amperage, he adds, is the substance part of
      electricity and voltage the speed. Like any other substance,
      electricity is composed of vibrating molecules, atoms, electrons,
      and other infinitesimal units, and the form that the substance
      takes is due to the rates of atomic speed.<br>
      <br>
      The only differences between one ray of light and another are in
      wave lengths or vibration, speed of discharge, and polarity.
      Assuming that electricity is like water flowing through a pipe,
      and that its voltage is the speed with which it travels, he first
      intensifies its atomic speed, then he breaks it up, releasing a
      force or ray of great speed and power.<br>

      A discovery so marvelous that it makes Peruna look like a soft
      drink has been reported from Seattle. it is that of the so-called
      "odic-activity ray" and is credited to Prof. Edgar L.
      Hollingshead, if we may believe all that we read. The principle of
      the thing is ridiculously simple. This ray makes heavy things
      light, to as great a degree as any one may wish. The idea is not
      exactly new, as more than one Jules Verne has conceived of a force
      that would counter and then overcome that of gravitation. it is
      predicted that steel vessels of the air will this be made as light
      as bubbles. Imagine Dempsey and Carpenter each with a chunk of
      this ray in his shoes. It would be better than fighting on the
      moon. Then again, talking of fighting, the ray would make
      newlyweds' biscuits lighter than seafoam, and lastly, flotation
      would be backed off the map. Where would Minerals Separation be
      then, poor thing!<br>

      </b><b> </b>The odic-activity ray, more powerful than the X-ray
      or the) radium ray, is to completely conquer the air.<br>
      <br>
      The giant sky liner, safe as any conveyance ever perfected, equal
      in luxury and comfort to the palatial greyhounds of the ocean
      lanes, is a posiibilty and probability of the near future.<br>
      <br>
      These were the announcements made by Prof. Edgar L. Hollingshead,
      scientist of Pasadena, in an exclusive interview in May, 1921.<br>
      <br>
      For, he declares, this powerful ray will make metals so light that
      a huge steel sky ship would become light as a bubble.<br>
      <br>
      Not only this, but the odic-activity ray, Prof. Hollingshead
      claims, will take the place of radium, valued at $120,000 a gram,
      and revolutionize the scientific world in the treatment of certain
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      And the cost of Lightening metals, of using the rays for medical
      purposes, is so minute as to be almost negligible.<br>
      <br>
      The odic-activity ray, according to Prof. Hollingshead, so far has
      successfully changed the weight of metal over 100 times in as many
      tests; it has caused hard clay to explode the instant the ray
      touched it; rock, opaque to the eye, has been made transparent and
      by means of the ray, an actual photograph has been taken through a
      solid sheet of lead. One application of the ray on metal has
      caused it to become permanently cold beyond the possibility of
      ever becoming heated. And it has instantly changed water into its
      primary gases hydrogen and oxygen.<br>

      An instrument which,it is claimed, shoots an ivisible projectile
      more disruptive than any known explosive has made Edgar L.
      Hollingshead and his "Ray Gun" an object of international
      attention.<br>
      <br>
      The missile is the so-called Odic Activity Ray which Hollingshead
      asserts he has been able to focus and direct with astonishing
      results. it is capable, he says, of disturbing the fundamental
      physical organization of our known universe, and may be employed
      in a commercial or military way.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>What It Will Do</b><br>
      <br>
      Although still in the experimental phase, the "Ray Gun" to the
      satisfaction of Hollingshead and his associates, has demonstrated
      that:<br>
      <br>
      The weight of any base metal may be instantly changed by being
      subjected to the Odic-Activity Ray.<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary rock can be made transparent.<br>
      <br>
      Mater can be made to disintegrate without explosion, vanishing
      without ash, smoke or residue.<br>
      <br>
      Water may be instantly transformed into its component elements.<br>
      <br>
      A piece of metal may be given more lifting power than any gas
      without losing its tensile strength.<br>
      <br>
      Nature's so-called immutable laws can be broken down by changing
      the atomic speed of matter.<br>
      <br>
      Hollingshead, for 15 years a physicist, says of his theories and
      experiments with the Odic-Activity Ray:<br>
      <br>
      "Ten years ago I came to the conclusion that matter did not depend
      upon physical prperties for its weight, but that weight is
      determined by the atomic speed of matter.<br>
      <br>
      "It is accepted as fact that matter is an aggregation of
      molecules. Now, molecules are eddies of force, traveling in
      circular progression. These in turn are formed of still tinier
      particles similarly in motion, called atomic speed. Atoms are
      composed of electrons and ions, which have been split up and found
      to be composed of still smaller particles.<br>
      <br>
      "I concluded, therefore, that there is no such thing as a solid,
      but that what we call a solid is in reality a seething mass of
      whirling force.<br>
      <br>
      "The only way in which force can manifest itself is through
      resistance to other force, principally gravity -- which we call
      weight.<br>
      <br>
      "Gravitation is force coming from the sun; the
      negative,levitation, is force returned from earth to sun. The
      weight of an object is the degree of resistance matter imposes in
      the path of these two forces, and the degree of resistance in turn
      is dependent upon the speed of the circular eddies of force of
      which matter is composed.<br>
      <br>
      "My experiments have been to find a way of generating force that
      would alter the speed of these whirls called matter so that i
      could change its degree of resistance to either gravitation or
      levitation and thus its weight. the result is the Odic Activity
      Ray which I have generated and which has greater possibilities
      than any other ray known.<br>
      <br>
      The Odic Activity Ray will affect a photographic plate or
      disintegrate matter, depending upon the wave length, which can be
      altered -- all rays known to man being between these two extremes.
      It can be directed and focused, something which has not been done
      with x-rays.<br>
      <br>
      "It has been generated to penetrate 16 inches of metal, and yet
      not harm the hand that encircles it.<br>
      <br>
      "The main aim of our experiments was to change the wright of
      metal, and this I have done to my satisfaction, if not yet
      publicly. We have decreased the weight of aluminum, for instance,
      20 per cent; then made it heavier than normal. And every base
      metal has responded to some degree, the change being instantaneous
      and permanent until again treated."<br>

      My invention relates to improvements in Armatures for Dynamo
      Electric Machines of which the following is a specification.<br>
      <br>
      Its object is to provide an armature core that will act upon the
      lines of the magnetic field in which the core rotates in such a
      manner as to reduce the tendency of sparking at the commutator
      when working under overload and to allow the reversal of
      motor&nbsp; machines without the imterposition of the starting box
      between the power line and the machine.<br>
      <br>
      My construction reduces the heating effect in the armature core
      and the result of danger of burning out the insulation of
      electrical conducctors.<br>
      <br>
      In the drawings with which I have illustrated my device and which
      form part of this specification, <br>
      <b><br>

      In the above drawings I have illustrated a motor having an
      armature A journaled in a frame B to which are connected
      electromagnetic poles C.<br>
      <br>
      The frame B may be of any ordinary construction but is preferably
      formed of a series of sections or parts joined together to make up
      magnetic conductors in the magnetic circuits of the machine. Top
      and bottom parts 2 and 3 are connected to the parts 4 and 5 to
      which are attached brackets 6 forming journal supports for the
      shaft 7 of the armature. The parts B and 3 are preferably made up
      of soft magnetic permeable iron while the sides 4 and 5 are made
      up of hard impermeable iron. The poles C are formed with a soft
      iron core 8, a hard iron tip 9 and windings 10 of electric
      conductors suitably connected with the electrical circuits of the
      machine to produce a magnetic field in which the armature A
      revolves. A detailed description of this construction of frame
      which is supplemental in its effects to the construction of
      armature which I am about to disclose, and which has alternately
      hard and soft material in its magnetic field, may be found in my
      companion application for improvements in Dynamo Electric Machines
      filed April 29, 1912 and bearing serial number 170,344.<br>
      <br>
      The armature A has an armature core D formed on the shaft 7 and
      made up of laminae 11 of soft iron or other magnetically permeable
      material which may be circular in shape or of any desirable form.
      The series of laminae 11 along the shaft 7 is divided into groups
      which are insulated from each other and from the shaft by suitable
      insulation 12. The laminae of the core are confined upon the shaft
      7 by collar plate 13 in the usual manner and the outer electric
      conductors or winding of the armature may be applied to the core
      in the usual way depending upon the form and purpose of the
      machine.<br>
      <br>
      A commutator E is provided at one end of the armature to which the
      electrical conductors are connected in the ordinary way and a
      second commutator F is formed at&nbsp; the opposite end of the
      armature being similar in structure to the groups of laminae in
      the armature core. The commutator F is made up of segments 14
      separated by insulation in the usual manner and has alternate
      segments about the commutator connected as indicated
      diagramatically in Fig. 4 by conductors 15 and 16. Brushed 17 are
      mounted on the frame to rest in contact with the commutator F and
      are connected by conductors 18 with the electric power circuit of
      the machine. Segments 14 of the commutator F are connected with
      the armature core by means of conductors 19 and 20 which extend
      through holes 21 formed in the laminae of the core. The conductors
      19 and 20 are insulated throughout their length and have terminals
      22 and 23 directly connected with the laminae 11 in alternate
      groups of laminae as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      The connection of the alternate groups of laminae through the
      terminals 22 and 23 and the conductors 19 and 20 with the segments
      of the commutator F brings them into electrical connection with
      opposite sides of the power line in any one position of the
      commutator under the brushes 17. The insulation between the groups
      of laminae in the core together with this connection to the
      electrical conductors causes the groups of laminae in the core to
      act as condensers. As the armature A carrying the commutator F
      with it rotates under the brushes 17 the direction of current the
      energy of which is impressed upon each group of laminae in the
      core is reversed as each of the brushes 17 comes in contact with
      the succeeding commutator segment. By this means there is set up
      in the core of the armature A an alternating condenser action
      having a rapidity of alternation depending upon the number of
      commutator segments in the commutator F which through its effect
      upon the impressed electromotive force prevents sparking at the
      commutator E and prevents heating of the armature core under heavy
      overloading or sudden reversal of current in the armature
      conductor.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig.5 I have shown an alternative construction of my armature
      in which the core D is made up in a manner identical with that
      described above and conductors 19 and 20 connected alternatively
      to the groups of laminae making up the core in the manner
      described but instead of being connected with the alternate
      segments of a commutator G which is otherwise similar in function
      and design to the commutator E shown in Fig. 3. By means of a
      structure similar to that diagramatically shown in Fig. 4, in
      which the alternate segments of the commutator G are connected by
      the conductors 15 and 16 and the conductors 19 and 20 are each
      connected to one of these series of alternate segments,
      alternating condenser action in the groups of laminae of the core
      is produced.<br>
      <br>
      The action set up in the armature core is identical in the two
      forms of device shown, in the alternative form of construction
      being less effective. The amount of copper in the windings
      employed is greater than that in the other machines now in general
      use of the same power and speed...<br>

      My invention relates to improvements in dynamo electric machines
      and its object is to provide a motor or generator frame which will
      prevent the excessive heating of the metal in the magnetic circuit
      of the machine and the attendant liability to burn out the
      insulation on contiguous electrical conductors and also to prevent
      the burning out of the armature and arcing of the commutator when
      machines are run under heavy overload or the currnet is reversed
      suddenly in the armature.<br>
      <br>
      By means of my invention I am enabled to overload motors and
      generators without the usual danger of heating and burning out and
      am enabled to reverse the direction of rotation of the motor
      either with or without load by reversing the terminal connections
      and without interpositioning of resistances such as are commonly
      necesssary in starting boxes for motors.<br>

      <br>
      In the above drawings I have illustrated a motor having an
      armature A rotating within frame B in which it is journaled. The
      frame B carries electromagnetic poles C disposed about the
      armature to induce a magnetic field in which the armature rotates.
      The poles C are provided with electric windings 2 which are
      connected with the main circuits of the machine in the usual
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      The frame B which I have illustrated is made up of top and bottom
      side parts 3 and 4 formed of soft wrought iron or other material
      having a high magnetic permeability. Side parts 5 and 6 are
      connected to the parts 3 and 4 by suitable bolts 7. The sides 5
      and 6 are formed of hard cast iron or other suitable material
      having a low magnetic permeability. Bracket pieces 8 are formed
      with bearings 10 in which the shaft 11 of the armature is
      journaled.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic poles C are formed with tips 12 fastened to cores 13,
      the cores and pole tips being attached to the respective sides 3,
      4, 5, and 6 on the frame B by means of suitable bolts 14. The pole
      tips 12 are composed of hard cast iron or other suitable material
      having a low magnetic permeability and are shaped to the periphery
      of the armature in the usual manner. The cores 13 are composed of
      soft wrought iron or other suitable material having a high
      magnetic permeability and are surrounded by the windings 2 adapted
      to induce electromagnetic action in the magnetic circuits of the
      machine. The armature A is of ordinary construction having a
      commutator 15 to which are fitted brushes 16 connected with
      terminals 17 of the machine. The material of the armature core is
      a soft iron of high magnetic permeability. It will be noted that
      the magnetic circuits induced in my motor during its operation by
      the application of electric current at the terminals 17 are made
      up of magnetic conductors having alternately high and low
      permeability. The magnetic lines, arising in the core 13 in the
      upper pole C which is connected with the side 3 of the frame B,
      pass through the pole tip 12 of hard iron, thence successively
      through the soft iron cor3e of the armature, the hard iron pole
      tip 12 connected with the side 5 or 6, the soft iron core 13 of
      the pole, the hard iron of the sides 5 and 6, the soft iron of the
      top side 3 and to the soft material of the core 13 where the lines
      originated. The other magnetic circuits in the machine are
      similarly made up and during the operation of the motor produce an
      action in the material of the circuits which prevents the heating
      and other obnoxious phenomena observed in motors of ordinary
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      The number of alternations of material of high and low
      permeability in the magnetic circuits may be increased as desired,
      the structure described being merely illustrative. The form of the
      parts of the magnetic circuit may also be changed and may not
      necessarily constitute the motor frame, the essential feature of
      my construction being the alternately high and low permeability of
      the magnetic circuits of the machine.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of my device does not differ from that of an
      ordinary electric machine except that it is unnecessary to have a
      starting box or rheostat in connection with motors to use in
      starting and reversing them.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of a structure producing the practical results
      described above is obvious and in a commercial machine the
      structure of which has been described I have secured all of these
      results permitting the stopping and starting of the machine under
      full load and its instant reversal without sparking at the
      commutator by reversing the direction of current at the terminals.
      No extra copper is used to produce these results over that in
      general practice.<br>
      <br>
      Water may be thrown on the commutator while the machine is working
      under load without burning out the armature and the working of the
      machine under heavy overload does not overheat the coils and burn
      the insulation thereon, nor does it overheat any material in the
      magnetic circuit or circuits.<br>
      <br>
      In practice I have found the proportions of one part or soft iron
      to one and four tenths parts of hard iron to produce very
      satisfactory results in the motor frame constructed in accordance
      with my invention...<br>

      My invention relates to improvements in electric motors of the
      induction type whose rotor is entirely free from winding,
      insulated bars, or electrical fittings of any kind, the primary
      object being the production of a motor of maximum efficiency and
      simplicity and which is free from commutators, collector rings and
      unprotected insulated.<br>

      To these ends my invention comprises the features of construction
      and combination of parts hereinafter more particularly described

      In the drawings A indicates a stationary field magnet and B a
      rotor. The field magnet consists of a coil of soft iron wire or a
      circular piece or band of iron or other suitable material which
      acts as a core 2 with insulated wire 3 wound on said core for
      magnetizing the same. The field magnet consisting of said core and
      coil of insulated wire wound around said core is supported by a
      spider C, said spider consisting of a disk or plate 4 integral
      with a hub 5 and having a plurality of openings 6 evenly
      distributed about the axis of the spider and in which set bolts 7
      are screwed outwardly through the peripheral portion of the disk.
      Positioned between the periphery of the disk and the inner surface
      of the insulated coil 3 on the core are a plurality of segmental
      buffers 8 made of fiber or other insulating or suitable material
      having inner recesses such as 9 in which the outer ends of the
      bolts 7 engage the segments or buffers and hold them pressed
      tightly against the coil 3, thus holding the field magnet in
      stationary position concentric with the axis of the spider.<br>
      <br>
      D indicates a suitable base frame having two bearing standards 10
      and 11 in the upper ends of which are seated journal boxes 12 in
      which a shaft E is freely journaled. The portion of the standard
      10 containing one of the journal boxes is formed with an inwardly
      extending sleeve 13 arranged coaxially with said shaft and upon
      the inner end of which the hub 5 is fitted and secured rigidly by
      the set bolt 14. Thus the field magnet remains stationary with the
      shaft E disposed co-axially therewith and free to revolve.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor B is the form of a circular plate or body 15 formed with
      a hub 16 secured to the shaft E by a set bolt 17 and with a
      circular endless sleeve 18 substantially incasing or encompassing
      the field magnet. Said sleeve is split and made in two parts 19
      and 20 formed with flanges 21 on the outer portions bolted
      together and with a space or gap 22 on the inner portion admitting
      the disk 4 of the spider freely and without contact. Preferably
      the rotor is made out of aluminum whereby or other suitable
      non-magnetic material when desired. The shaft projects from one of
      the standards sufficiently to receive and support a drive pulley
      or coupling not illustrated, by which a drive pulley or coupling
      not illustrated, by which a driven element can be connected to
      transmit power. By means of the construction described the rotor
      is adapted to revolve entirely outside of the field magnet, to
      confine and take advantage of all the lines of force produced by
      the magnetic circuit. The field magnet of the magnet of the motor
      is wound in a coil and may be divided into six or any number of
      sections such as is illustrated in Fig. 2 when desired.<br>
      <br>
      In the diagram one method of operating my improved motor is
      illustrated by the use of an armature of a synchronous rotary
      converter provided with a three wire circuit, but the method may
      be varied to suit various conditions as desired without departing
      from the spirit of my invention.<br>
      <br>
      In operation ( see Fig. 3 ), for illustration, a motor having
      armature F is operated in the usual manner, being supplied with
      direct current from an ordinary line circuit. There are three lead
      wires 40, 41 and 42 connected to the commutator 23 at points
      equi-distant from each other around its periphery. Each lead
      therefore obtains an alternating current or impulse wave
      continuously changing its polarity. At any one position of the
      commutator, two of the leads are taking a current of one polarity,
      while the third lead is taking current of the opposite polarity,
      and this condition is changed three in each revolution of the
      commutator. The current resulting is three phase of long wave
      length.<br>
      <br>
      In the field magnet B of the motor the current is fed for
      illustration through lead 43 into a section of coil 3 wound left
      handed creating a magnetic flux, in that part of the core and then
      crosses over and acts in a similar manner in an oppositely
      disposed section 26 of the winding, each terminal section of the
      field section being wound in a direction opposite to that of the
      leading section, 25 indicating one of the connections between a
      pair of the sections of winding. The terminal or lead 27 of
      section 26 connects with the collector ring 28 while to terminal
      or lead 43 connects with collector ring 31, thus completing the
      circuit back to the commutator. The coils as stated are duplicated
      and connected with the collector ring 29, and the action described
      thus takes place three times in the field windings during each
      revolution of the armature F. As a result there are three pairs of
      sections of field windings and three changes of polarity in the
      current produced in each revolution of the armature A, there are
      therefore nine distinct changes in the intensity and polarity of
      the impulse waves of current continually following each other in
      sequence in the field windings 3 of the motor.<br>
      <br>
      The direction of motion of the rotor B is in accordance with the
      manner in which the coils in the field are connected. Reversing
      the connections causes the rotor to revolve in an opposite
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it would appear that an induced lagging current
      is set up in the rotor with a slight lag in phase within the
      aluminum or other electrically conductive rotor surrounding the
      winding upon a proper core, producing an appreciable torque.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor in revolving is substantially noiseless due to the
      omission of brushes, collector rings and commutators and the
      winding is protected by the rotor so that there is no danger of
      the insulation becoming broken or damaged. The field magnet can
      also be easily adjusted by the set bolts 7, so that it centers
      accurately within the incasement of the rotor, Heating of the
      parts is also reduced to a minimum...<br>
