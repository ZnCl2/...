        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Wearing braces to move and
          straighten teeth can be a lengthy, painful experience. Now,
          two University of Pennsylvania researchers believe electrical
          stimulation of the gum may cut in half the time braces must be
          worn. The researchers are just beginning a 3-year clinical
          study with 60 female patients to test the mehtod. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Othrodontist Zeev Davidovitch, who
          began the work in 1975 with materials scientist Edward
          Korostoff, says orthodontists have conventionally used mechan
          ical force to shift teeth. Mechanical devices that push or
          pull a tooth apply force to a tooth's crown. The force is
          transmitted downward to the root. there the bone tneds to
          dissolve or resorb ahead of the moving tooth's root where the
          pressure is high and to build up behind the root where the
          pressure is low. the problem, says Davidovitch, is that tissue
          remodeling doen'st happen overnight. "What we're doing with
          electricity is simply enhancing the rate of tissue
          remodeling", he says. Although braces are still necessary,
          they are needed for a shorter time. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The electricity source is
          approximately the size and shape of two nickels stuck
          together. It consists of a transistor and several resisors and
          batteries, encased in epoxy and dental acrylic plastic. The
          device provides a constant current of between 15 and 20
          microamperes at about 1.5 volts. Korostoff says the easily
          installed movable circular unit attaches to the bracket
          already installed for orthodontic wires and lies against the
          gum, between the gum and the check. One major effort during
          the first year of the clinical trials will be to reduce the
          size of the device, Korostoff says. A graduate student
          researcher, who has worn the device for a short time, says its
          presence is noticeable, but it is not uncomfortable compared
          with the normal discomfort people suffer when they wear
          orthodontic braces. He says he did not feel the electric
          current at all. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although the method was tested
          successfully on cats, Davidovitch admits that testing it on
          humans is a new field. "We don't know what will happen", he
          says. "There are many questions we haven't answered yet".
          Initially, patients will weat the device for about 8 to 10
          hours at night. "We may find that it's not sufficient", says
          Davidovitch, "but this is why we plan to conduct these
          experiments, to get the bugs out of the system". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Both Korostoff and Davidovitch are
          optimistic that their method will work on humans as well as it
          did on cats, and they are very excited about their work.
          Through the university of Pennsylvania, they hold a patent on
          the method and device now being tested at the university's
          School of Dental Medicine. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Philadelphia</i> -- Electric
          braces, which could take a big bite out of the amount of time
          usually needed to straighten teeth, have been developed by
          researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental
          Medicine. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Dr Zeev Davidovitch, orthodontics
          professor and dead of the research team, says miniature
          batteries, transistors and resistors produce and regulate the
          low-level electric current in the device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The electrical-mechanical device,
          used with conventional orthodontics braces, has been
          successfully tested on animals. Davidovitch says it could
          straighten teeth twice as fast as regular breaces and be no
          more inconvenient. He hopes to begin a 3-year study on humans
          soon. "The bulkiness of this power pack resembles the
          bulkiness of an extension screw, [often] used to expand
          palates", he says. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"It can be easily taken in and out
          and should pose no dicomfort to the patient. he can weat it
          only at night, and he can't throw it out of adjustment unless
          he steps on it or breaks it with a hammer." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In initial tests, sandard braces
          were placed on one side of a cat's mouth, the device on teh
          other. An electrode was placed on either side of a tooth and a
          small amount of electricity was generated. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Weeks later, the researchers sound
          that where there was electrical stimulation tooth movement was
          twice as fast. The scientists also found that because cell
          stimulation occurs a few minutes after electricity is
          intriduced, the device does not have to be worn 24 hours a
          day. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"When you try to move teeth, you
          apply forces -- the wires, srings and elastic bands -- to the
          teeth. The force is transmitted to the surrounding tissue,"
          Davidovitch explains. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"We thought if we could get more
          cells involved in the surrounding tissue, we would get rapid
          tooth movement." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has been estimated that only 5
          to 10 percent of those who need orthodontia receive it,
          Davidovitch says. If treatment time, which often runs into
          years, can be halved, more patients will be willing to undergo
          treatment, he predicts. </p>

          <b>Abstract -- </b>Disclosed is a method and apparatus for
          electrically stimulating bone growth and tooth movement in the
          mouths of mammals. A positive electrode is placed on the gum
          surface adjacent the bone structure which is to be resorbed. A
          negative electrode is placed on the gum surface adjacent the
          bone tissue which is to be accreted or built up. A current
          source is connected, such that a small current flows between
          the electrodes, which has the effect of stimulating bone
          growth in a specific direction. In a preferred embodiment, the
          electrodes are placed on the gum surface adjacent a tooth, the
          positive electrode on the side towards which the tooth should
          move, and the negative on the side from which the tooth will
          move. Application of a small current to the electrodes will
          enhance the repositioning of the tooth in conjuction with
          normal orthodontic practices. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention relates to
          orthodontic techniques in general, and the reduction in time
          required for specific tooth movement in particular. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Orthodontic tooth movement
          presently is accomplished by the application of mechanical
          forces to teeth. An apparatus is connected inside the mouth of
          a patient which applies, through the use of springs, rubber
          bands, or other means, a mechanical force in the direction of
          desired tooth movement. These forces cause the bone to resorb
          (be moved) in the direction of force and cause the bone to
          grow on the other side of the tooth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This process of orthodontic force
          application enables teeth to move in the mouth within the
          boundaries of the neighboring tissues. The tooth movement is
          clarified by Wolff's Law which states, in effect, that bone
          under mechanical stress is remodeled to accomodate or reduce
          the stress. The unfortunate practical aspect to known
          techniques of orthodontic movement is that the mechanical
          apparatus, or "braces", must be worn by the patient for
          extended periods of time, often several years or more. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">U.S. Pat. No. 3,842,841 teaches the
          application of a direct current to aid healing of bone
          fractures in the human body, but requires surgical
          implantation. A negative electrode (cathode) is surgically
          inserted into the site of a fracture, and a positive electrode
          (anode) is taped to the skin elsewhere. Although the precise
          biological process is not understood, the current flowing
          through the factured bone increases the healing rate of the
          damaged bone tissue. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, to date, there have been
          no substantial improvements in enhancing tooth movement to
          reduce the total amount of time over which an orthodontic
          appliance must be used in order to accomplish a given amount
          of tooth movement or repositioning. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, in view of the
          foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to
          reposition teeth in a patient's mouth by applying an
          electrical potential to the patient's gums in the immediate
          vicinity. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is a further object of the
          present invention to increase the rate of movement of teeth
          undergoing mechanical stress in accordance with known
          orthodontic practices. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is a still further object of the
          present invention to provide an electronic circuit capable of
          being retained in conjunction with an existing orthodontic
          appliance for providing a constant current output to
          electrodes located adjacent to a tooth to be repositioned. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is an additional object of the
          present invention to provide a method and apparatus for
          stimulating and controlling bone growth in a patient's mouth
          in order to correct alveolar bone defects, close cleft
          palates, or maintain the alveolar ridge in edentulous patients
          (those who have lost their teeth). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In accordance with the above, the
          other objects, a method and apparatus for the initiation and
          enhancement of tooth movement comprises the disposition of an
          anodic electrode in the direction of applied force and a
          cathodic electronic on the opposite side of the tooth to be
          moved. A current source is connected to the two electrodes
          which causes the tooth to be repositioned either solely or in
          combination with an existing orthodontic appliance. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The application of a small current,
          through appropriate surface electrodes in the mouth, also can
          be utilized to stimulate bone accretion in the vicinity of a
          cathodic electrode and bone resorption in the vicinity of an
          anodic electrode. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A
            PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Referring now to the drawings
          wherein like reference characters designate like parts
          throughout the several views, FIG. 1 is a bottom view of an
          orthodontic appliance along with the present invention fitted
          to a cat's mouth in accordance with known techniques. Although
          the present application was reduced to practice and
          demonstrated on a cat tooth, the anatomy and histology of the
          cat canine and its surrounding tissues is similar to
          one-rooted human teeth. Although the present description will
          be of the application of the present invention to the test
          animals, the invention is clearly of use in the human
          application, which would provide no unobvious difficulties. A
          base plate 10 is located in the roof of the patient's mouth
          and fixed to the premolar teeth 12 by conventional clamps 14.
          Orthodontic springs 16 are connected to the rearmost premolar
          teeth 12 and the teeth to be repositioned, in this instance,
          canine teeth 18 and 20. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An anode electrode 22 and a cathode
          electrode 24 are placed such that they are in contact with the
          gingival tissue 26. The anode 22 is placed adjacent the tooth
          in the direction of desired movement, in this instance,
          towards spring 16. The cathode 24 is placed on the opposite
          side of tooth 18. The anode 22 and cathode 24 are connected to
          positive and negative leads from power pack 28 contained in
          base plate 10. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The details of the power pack's
          internal features can be seen by reference to FIG. 4. The
          negative terminal 29 is connected to the negative side of
          battery 30, with the positive side of the battery 30 connected
          to transistor 32. Transistor 32 is interconnected with
          transistor 34 and resistor 36 and, then, to the positive
          terminal 38. In this preferred embodiment, a constant current
          of approximately 20 microamperes is provided over a range of
          tissue impedances, such that the changing impedance between
          the anode and cathode does not substantially affect the amount
          of current flowing therebetween. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIGS. 2 and 3 are side and bottom
          views, respectively, of a preferred electrode placement, with
          the direction of desired movement shown by arrow 40. Although
          the mechanical force generating system comprising orthodontic
          springs 16, shown in FIG. 1, are not included in FIGS. 2 and
          3, they could clearly be added to further enhance the movement
          of tooth 18 in direction 40. However, tooth movement can be
          accomplished solely by means of the electrical stimulation
          shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, and this remains one embodiment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, the preferred embodiment
          of the present invention is the use of the electrodes to
          increase the rate of movement of teeth undergoing orthodontic
          treatment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In a test of the FIG. 1 apparatus,
          five female cats (Group A) had both canine teeth tipped in the
          direction of arrow 40 by coil springs generating 80 grams of
          force for a period of 14 days. Five additional female cats
          (Group B) had both canines tipped in the same direction.
          However, Group B cats also had a stainless steel cathode 24
          and a gold anode 22 connected to the electrical circuit of
          FIG. 4, with the electrode placement shown in FIG. 1. Both
          electrodes were in contact with the gingival tissues at, and
          partially surrounding, the area of the alveolar bone crest.
          Dummy electrodes (not shown) were also placed in contact with
          the gingival tissues surrounding canine tooth 20, but were not
          connected to power pack 28. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the Group A animals, the rate of
          canine tooth movement was similar on both sides. In Group B,
          however, the rate was unequal with the activated electrode
          side doving canine tooth 18 twice as much as electrically
          unactivated canine tooth 20. For instance, the distance
          between incisors 42 and unactivated canine tooth 20 increased
          by 0.29 mm after seven days, and an additional 0.17 mm after
          fourteen days. The distance between the incisors 42 and the
          electrically activated canine 18 after seven days had
          increased 0.58 mm, and after fourteen days an additional 0.61
          mm. Because both canine teeth 18 and 20 had identical
          mechanical forces applied thereto (by springs 16), the
          increased rate of movement of canine tooth 18 is attributable
          to the application of electric current to the surrounding gum
          tissues. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Because the present invention
          essentially doubles the rate of movement, the length of time
          necessary to achieve a repositioning of a tooth would be cut
          in half. Although human tests have not yet been conducted, it
          is believed the results will be similar to those shown in the
          cat studies, because of the similarity of cat canine teeth and
          their surrounding tissues to single root human teeth. Thus,
          the applicability to the human orthodontic patient is believed
          obvious in view of the above teachings. The application to the
          human patient may require current levels different from the 21
          microamps applied in the cat embodiment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, different combinations
          of implanted and surface electrodes will be obvious to those
          of ordinary skill in the art in view of the applicants'
          teachings. Although, a constant current supply source was
          utilized in a preferred embodiment, constant voltage with a
          variable current source may be used with slightly different
          results. Additionally, an alternating current with a D.C.
          impressed thereon would also work. The only requirement being
          that one electrode be substantially anodic and the other
          substantially cathodic, i.e., the total current (AC and DC
          combined) is more in one direction than the other. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The current supply means utilized
          in the cat tests delivered a constant current of 21.+-. 4 .mu.
          amps. It is believed that some variation may be necessary for
          individual patients, but that current ranges of between 5 and
          100 microamps will be useful in obtaining similar results in
          humans. Additionally, where, as will be seen, extended
          electrodes are utilized, as in FIGS. 6 and 7, the total
          current applied to the extended electrode (or a series of
          button electrodes) must be increased in order to maintain a
          current density at the gum tissue, sufficient to cause bone
          accretion or resorption. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present embodiments indicate
          the placement of electrodes on the soft gingival tissue
          adjacent, but not in contact with, the bone in order to
          produce the desired effect, although there is no indication
          that placement of the electrodes on the bone itself would have
          a deleterious effect. A preferred circuit for a constant
          current power supply is shown in FIG. 4, although many compact
          intra-oral power supplies will become apparent to those
          skilled in the art in view of the applicants' invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The application of surface
          electrodes to stimulate controlled bone growth can also supply
          the solution for non-surgical correction of alveolar bone
          defects, and cleft palates. FIG. 5 depicts a tooth 50, gum 52,
          with the alveolar bone ridge 54. A defect in the alveolar bone
          ridge is indicated at 56. The placement of a cathodic surface
          electrode 24 on the gum in the region of the defect 56 could
          stimulate bone growth so as to eliminate the defect. The
          anodic surface electrode (not shown) would be located
          elsewhere in the patient's mouth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A similar application of the
          surface electrode could be utilized in conjunction with a
          cleft palate, as shown in FIG. 6. The region of the cleft 60
          would be gradually filled by bone due to the electrical
          stimulation of cathodic electrodes 24 placed on the surface of
          tissues covering the bony palate 62. As in FIG. 5, the anodic
          electrode would be located elsewhere in the patient's mouth.
          As in all depictions of the use of surface electrodes, only in
          the region where bone growth is to be stimulated, or the bone
          is to be resorbed, is the electrode in contact with the gum,
          or gingival tissues. Elsewhere, the wires connecting the
          surface electrodes to the power supply would be insulated so
          as to restrict bone accretion, or resorption, to the desired
          area. It has been proposed that over an extended period of
          time, the bone accretion to the bony palate in the vicinity of
          electrodes 24 would result in a buildup, and eventual closure,
          of the cleft region 60 in the victim of a cleft palate. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has been found that the bone has
          piezoelectric properties: that is to say, when a force is
          applied to the tooth, the resulting force on the bone
          generates very small, but measurable, electrical currents. It
          is believed that the application of these minute currents
          stimulate, and maintain, the alveolar bone ridge, which serve
          as the base for anchoring of human teeth. However, edentulous
          patients suffer from a gradual resorption of the alveolar bone
          ridge in the mouth, which makes it more and more difficult to
          anchor false teeth in the patient's mouth. It is believed that
          the absence of real teeth in the edentulous patient causes the
          termination of the minor stimulation currents necessary for
          the maintenance of the alveolar bone ridge and, consequently,
          the ridge resorbs into the roof of the mouth. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 7 depicts an arrangement of
          cathodic electrode 24, wherein it would be placed adjacent the
          alveolar bone ridge in a patient's mouth. The application of a
          suitable current supply with the anode (not shown) located
          elsewhere in the mouth may provide sufficient stimulation to
          the alveolar bone ridge, such that it is maintained, or even
          reformed, in the edentulous patient. Obviously, the power
          supply, and appropriate electrodes, could be located in the
          bridge work of false teeth, and would be applicable both to
          the upper and lower bond ridges. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although the invention has been
          described relative to a specific embodiment thereof, it is not
          so limited and many modifications and variations thereof will
          be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of
          the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that,
          within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be
          practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This article reviews the evolution
          of concepts regarding the biological foundation of
          force-induced tooth movement. Nineteenth century hypotheses
          proposed two mechanisms: application of pressure and tension
          to the periodontal ligament (PDL), and bending of the alveolar
          bone. Histologic investigations in the early and middle years
          of the 20th century revealed that both phenomena actually
          occur concomitantly, and that cells, as well as extracellular
          components of the PDL and alveolar bone, participate in the
          response to applied mechanical forces, which ultimately
          results in remodeling activities. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Experiments with isolated cells in
          culture demonstrated that shape distortion might lead to
          cellular activation, either by opening plasma membrane ion
          channels, or by crystallizing cytoskeletal filaments.
          Mechanical distortion of collagenous matrices, mineralized or
          non-mineralized, may, on the other hand, evoke the development
          of bioelectric phenomena (stress-generated potentials and
          streaming potentials) that are capable of stimulating cells by
          altering the electric charge on their membrane or their fluid
          envelope. In intact animals, mechanical perturbations on the
          order of about 1 min/d are apparently sufficient to cause
          profound osteogenic responses, perhaps due to matrix
          proteoglycan-related "strain memory". </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Enzymatically isolated human PDL
          cells respond biochemically to mechanical and chemical
          signals. The latter include endocrines, autocrines, and
          paracrines. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies
          showed that during the early places of tooth movement, PDL
          fluids are shifted, and cells and matrix are distorted.
          Vasoactive neurotransmitters are released from periodontal
          nerve terminals, causing leukocytes to migrate out of adjacent
          capillaries. Cytokines and growth factors are secreted by
          these cells, stimulating PDL cells and alveolar bone lining
          cells to remodel their related matrices. This remodeling
          activity facilitates movement of teeth into areas in which
          bone had been resorbed. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This emerging information suggests
          that in the living mammal, many cell types are involved in the
          biological response to applied mechanical stress to teeth, and
          thereby to bone. Essentially, cells of the nervous, immune,
          and endocrine systems become involved in the activation and
          response of PDL and alveolar bone cells to applied stresses.
          This fact implies that research in the area of the biological
          response to force application to teeth should be sufficiently
          broad to include explorations of possible associations between
          physical, cellular, and molecular phenomena. The goals of this
          investigative field should continue to expound on fundamental
          principles, particularly on extrapolating new findings to the
          clinical environment, where millions of patients are subjected
          annually to applications of mechanical forces to their teeth
          for long periods of time in an effort to improve their
          position in the oral cavity. Recently developed research tools
          such as cell culture techniques and immunologic probes, are
          the best hope for enhancing this development. </p>

                  Tooth Movement</font></b></p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention relates
          generally to medical apparatus and methods. More particularly,
          the present invention relates to methods and systems for
          facilitating, accelerating, and stabilizing tooth movement
          before, during and after orthodontic procedures. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Orthodontic procedures suffer from
          four major problems. First, the braces or other appliances
          which effect the tooth movement must be worn for long periods
          of time. Second, even after a successful orthodontic
          treatment, the teeth often relapse towards their original
          positions once the braces or other treatment appliances are
          removed. Third, the mechanically induced movement of teeth can
          cause significant discomfort to the patient. Fourth, the
          wearing of braces is esthetically displeasing, uncomfortable,
          and compromises oral hygiene. While recently introduced clear
          plastic visible "aligners" largely overcome the latter
          problems, such aligners are not suitable for all patients.
          Moreover, the aligners do not reduce treatment time, do not
          reduce the risk of relapse, and do not lessen the pain
          associated with tooth movement in the jaw. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For these reasons, it would be
          desirable to provide improved orthodontic technologies for
          moving teeth which overcome at least some of the problems
          noted above. In particular, it would be desirable to provide
          orthodontic methods and systems which can reduce the time
          necessary to effect a desired tooth movement, which can reduce
          the pain associated with tooth movement, which can reduce the
          tendency of teeth to relapse to their original positions after
          the orthodontic treatment is stopped, and/or which can reduce
          the time in which unsightly braces need to be worn. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>2. Description of Background Art</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Nicozisis et al. (2000) Clin.
          Orthod. Res. 3:192-201, describes experiments which
          demonstrate the presence of endogenous relaxin in cranial
          tissue of mice and speculates that relaxin may be used as an
          adjunct to orthodontic or surgical therapy to promote
          manipulation of sutural tissues or affect stability. The
          application of electrical current to stimulate bone growth and
          remodeling in orthodontic procedures is described in U.S. Pat.
          Nos. 4,854,865; 4,519,779; and 4,153,060. Appliances for local
          and systematic drug delivery to the gingival tissues are

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention provides
          improved methods and systems for repositioning teeth in
          patients. In addition, the present invention provides improved
          methods and systems for stabilizing teeth which have already
          been repositioned in order to reduce or eliminate the tendency
          of the repositioned teeth to relapse, i.e., move back toward
          their prior positions. The methods for repositioning teeth
          comprise applying force to at least one tooth, and typically
          to more than one tooth and/or to different teeth over time, in
          the jaw of the patient. For both repositioning or stabilizing,
          tissue remodeling and/or an angiogenic substance(s) is
          administered to the patient to promote remodeling of
          periodontal tissue surrounding the root(s) of the tooth or
          teeth to be moved. Preferred substance(s) will bind to and
          activate the relaxin receptor in the tissues which anchor the
          teeth or other craniofacial structures. Most preferred is
          relaxin or an analog or mimetic thereof which combines tissue
          remodeling activity with angiogenic activity. Analogs include
          peptides, oligomers, fragments, etc. which comprise the active
          region of native relaxin and mimetics include small molecule
          drugs, typically below 2 kD, designed to mimic the activity of
          native relaxin. Alternatively, substance(s) with predominantly
          angiogenic activity could be selected, such as VEGF, bFGF,
          estrogen, nitrous oxide, naltrexone, or the like. Further
          alternatively, collagenases or other tissue-softening enzymes
          could be utilized to promote periodontal tissue remodeling
          according to the present invention. In some instances, it may
          be desirable to combine two or more tissue remodeling and/or
          angiogenic substance(s) having differing activities. In other
          instances it may be desirable to deliver different tissue
          remodeling and/or angiogenic substance(s) at different times
          during the orthodontic treatment and/or to different regions
          of the periodontal tissue. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The term "relaxin" means human
          relaxin, including intact full length relaxin or a portion of
          the relaxin molecule that retains biological activity [as
          described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,321, preferably recombinant
          human relaxin (H2)] and other active agents with relaxin-like
          activity, such as Relaxin and portions that retain biological
          activity Like Factor (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,911,997
          at SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4, and column 5, line 27-column 6, line
          4), relaxin analogs and portions that retain biological
          activity (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,395 at SEQ ID
          NOS: 1 and 2, and column 3, lines 16-40), and agents that
          competitively displace bound relaxin from a receptor. Relaxin
          can be made by any method known to those skilled in the art,
          for example, as described in any of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,759,807;
          4,835,251 and co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 07/908,766 (PCT
          US90/02085) and Ser. No. 08/080,354 (PCT US94/0699). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The tissue remodeling and/or
          angiogenic substance(s) will be delivered at a delivery rate
          and a total dosage which are selected to facilitate tooth
          repositioning and tissue remodeling. Typically, the dosage
          rates will be in the range from 1 ng to 500 ?g per day,
          usually from 10 ng/day to 20 ?g/day, preferably from 20 ng/day
          to 10 ?g/day. The dosage and other aspects of the delivery may
          be adjusted from time-to-time in response to the effectiveness
          of treatment, such as the resistance of a particular tooth or
          group of teeth, where the dosage might be increased if
          resistance is not sufficiently reduced in response to an
          initial dosage. </p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0001] 1. Field of the Invention.
          The present invention relates generally to medical apparatus
          and methods. More particularly, the present invention relates
          to methods and systems for facilitating, accelerating, and
          stabilizing tooth movement before, during and after
          orthodontic procedures. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0002] Orthodontic procedures
          suffer from four major problems. First, the braces or other
          appliances which effect the tooth movement must be worn for
          long periods of time. Second, even after a successful
          orthodontic treatment, the teeth often relapse towards their
          original positions once the braces or other treatment
          appliances are removed. Third, the mechanically induced
          movement of teeth can cause significant discomfort to the
          patient. Fourth, the wearing of braces is esthetically
          displeasing, uncomfortable, and compromises oral hygiene. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While recently introduced clear
          plastic visible"aligners"largely overcome the latter problems,
          such aligners are not suitable for all patients. Moreover, the
          aligners do not reduce treatment time, do not reduce the risk
          of relapse, and do not lessen the pain associated with tooth
          movement in the jaw. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[0003] For these reasons, it would
          be desirable to provide improved orthodontic technologies for
          moving teeth which overcome at least some of the problems
          noted above. In particular, it would be desirable to provide
          orthodontic methods and systems which can reduce the time
          necessary to effect a desired tooth movement, which can reduce
          the pain associated with tooth movement, which can reduce the
          tendency of teeth to relapse to their original positions after
          the orthodontic treatment is stopped, and/or which can reduce
          the time in which unsightly braces need to be worn. </p>
