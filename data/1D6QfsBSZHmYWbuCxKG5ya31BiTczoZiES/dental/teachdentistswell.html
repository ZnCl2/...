            "Drill, Fill, &amp; Bill"</b> has been standard operating
          procedure in dental practice for the past century,
          supplemented by extractions and dentures. In the past few
          decades, we have also benefited from such novel wonderments as
          implants, restorations, invisible braces, mercury-free
          fillings, and teeth whitening.</span><br>

          Dozens more technologies presently under development promise
          to eliminate bad breath, prevent cavities, restore teeth with
          applications of mineral formulas, or even to grow new teeth
          from stem cells.<br>
          <br>
          If, however, you were to ask your dentist about any of these
          inventions, it is a very safe bet that he or she would plead
          ignorance. Being burdened with debt while trying to get a
          life, few practitioners have the time to do research.<br>
          <br>
          Don't hold your halitosis waiting for such marvels to become
          available. The tedious and costly process of discovery,
          development, safety testing, government approval, and
          marketing can take twenty years or more.<br>
          <br>
          For example, scores of patents have been granted since the
          1980s for various formulations that incorporate sodium
          pyrophosphate to dissolve the plaque that plagues our mouths.
          It did not become an ingredient in toothpaste until 2017.<br>

          morph into plaque, cavities, and periodontal disease. Arginine
          is being used already in some dental products for tooth
          sensitivity. If you can't wait for his US Patent Application

          Pitts says, “The way we treat teeth today is not ideal – when
          we repair a tooth by putting in a filling, that tooth enters a
          cycle of drilling and re-filling as, ultimately, each “repair”
          fails.<br>

          “Not only is our device kinder to the patient and better for
          their teeth, but it’s expected to be at least as

          Gerard Judd takes a much simpler approach to the problem of
          restoring enamel and preventing its loss. He advises us to
          brush the teeth with bar soap and to take daily supplements of
          calcium and vitamin D, plus monosodium phosphate. He explains
          his regimen in a free online book, "</span><b><a

          phosphate is the best supplement for phosphate since it is
          very pure and highly soluble in water. Simply take about 1/5
          teaspoon (1 gram), dissolve it in 1 inch of water in less than
          a minute, then fill up the glass and drink it daily. This
          takes care of all the bones, teeth, DNA, RNA and at least 30
          phosphate-containing enzymes..." <br>
          <br>
          "To make teeth clean one brushes with any bar soap. Soap
          washes off in just 2 rinses. What about toothpastes? Glycerine
          in all tooth pastes is so sticky that it takes 27 washes to
          get it off. Teeth brushed with any toothpaste are coated with
          a film and cannot properly reenamelize... [ Plaque ] is
          prevented and eventually removed by brushing with bar soap.<br>
          <br>
          "Taking calcium and phosphate in the diet results in
          reenamelization of the teeth, but only when they are clean.
          Bar soap does a perfect job in cleaning the surface..."<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, if you choose take Dr Judd's advice, use soap that
          does not contain glycerine.<br>

          Don Ho, Wayne Newton, and other crooners sang the praises of
          "Tiny Bubbles" in the 1960s, nanotechnology did not yet exist.
          Fifty years later, the song has been vindicated by
          nanobubbles, which possess unique properties with tremendous
          potential applications. Freshwater and saltwater fish can live
          together in it. Nanobubble water is 70% effective against
          cancer. It purifies water. And it treats gingivitis. <br>
          <br>
          Jeng Soo Choi was granted USP 8821160 ("Nano Bubble Generating
          Nozzle and Oral Cleaning Device"). Similarly, Yoshiro Mano's
          US Patent Application 20100151043 ("Preparation for
          Sterilization or Disinfection of Tissue") uses nanobubble
          water "for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a
          periodontal disease". It's anybody's guess as to when it will

          Cleaning Teeth"), according to which, "Two electrodes are
          connected to a DC power supply for electrolytic cleaning. The
          dental protein deposit bearing positive charge is separated
          from the teeth. The mucosa of dental deposit is dissolved in
          water. The calcium in odontolith of calcium lactate is educed
          out from negative electrode. Thus, the teeth or artificial
          teeth are cleaned safely and effectively and the dental
          periphery is cleaned in large area. The implement includes
          periodontal cleaner, artificial teeth cleaner, etc."<br>

          Japanese patent <b>JP2010275287</b> ("Method for Preventing

          coating shows excellent properties in terms of antibacterial
          efficacy (even against multi-resistant strains), adhesion and
          biocompatibility. The life-time of an implant in a human body

          a specialist in regenerative dentistry (Dental Institute of

          stem cells are cultivated to form a bud which is inserted in
          the socket of a missing tooth. Within a few months, it matures
          into a fully formed tooth. Sharpe and his team set up a
          company, Odontis, to exploit the technology, and received
          £400,000 funding from the National Endowment for Science,
          Technology and the Arts and the Wellcome Trust, but nothing

          "A lot of empty space is important. The cavities are
