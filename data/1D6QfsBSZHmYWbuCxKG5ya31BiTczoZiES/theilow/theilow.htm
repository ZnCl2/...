          Water From Air Humidity</b></font></blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;">ScienceDaily (June 8, 2009) —
      Not a plant to be seen, the desert ground is too dry. But the air
      contains water, and research scientists have found a way of
      obtaining drinking water from air humidity. The system is based
      completely on renewable energy and is therefore autonomous.</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;">Cracks permeate the dried-out
      desert ground, the landscape bears testimony to the lack of water.
      But even here, where there are no lakes, rivers or groundwater,
      considerable quantities of water are stored in the air. In the
      Negev desert in Israel, for example, annual average relative air
      humidity is 64 percent – in every cubic meter of air there are
      11.5 milliliters of water.</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;">Research scientists at the
      Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology
      IGB in Stuttgart working in conjunction with their colleagues from
      the company Logos Innovationen have found a way of converting this
      air humidity autonomously and decentrally into drinkable water.
      “The process we have developed is based exclusively on renewable
      energy sources such as thermal solar collectors and photovoltaic
      cells, which makes this method completely energy-autonomous. It
      will therefore function in regions where there is no electrical
      infrastructure,” says Siegfried Egner, head of department at the
      IGB. The principle of the process is as follows: hygroscopic brine
      – saline solution which absorbs moisture – runs down a
      tower-shaped unit and absorbs water from the air. It is then
      sucked into a tank a few meters off the ground in which a vacuum
      prevails. Energy from solar collectors heats up the brine, which
      is diluted by the water it has absorbed.</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;">Because of the vacuum, the
      boiling point of the liquid is lower than it would be under normal
      atmospheric pressure. This effect is known from the mountains: as
      the atmospheric pressure there is lower than in the valley, water
      boils at temperatures distinctly below 100 degrees Celsius. The
      evaporated, non-saline water is condensed and runs down through a
      completely filled tube in a controlled manner. The gravity of this
      water column continuously produces the vacuum and so a vacuum pump
      is not needed. The reconcentrated brine runs down the tower
      surface again to absorb moisture from the air.</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left;">“The concept is suitable for
      various sizes of installation. Single-person units and plants
      supplying water to entire hotels are conceivable,” says Egner.
      Prototypes have been built for both system components – air
      moisture absorption and vacuum evaporation – and the research
      scientists have already tested their interplay on a laboratory
      scale. In a further step the researchers intend to develop a
      demonstration facility.</blockquote>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005] 1. Field of the Invention</b> <br>
      <br>
      [0006] The invention relates to a device for extracting water from
      atmospheric air having a free-flowing adsorbent (3, 13) or an
      absorbent (3, 13) in particular a saline solution (3, 13), having
      a hygroscopic salt for the adsorption or absorption of water, the
      adsorption or absorption being provided at least along an
      adsorption or absorption section (7). More particularly the
      invention pertains to a guide element (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) for
      guiding the adsorbent or absorbent and at least one metering unit
      having at least one orifice (6) for adding the saline solution (3)
      to the guide element and a metering unit for pressurizing the
      saline solution (3). <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0007] 2. Description of Related Art Including Information
        Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98</b> <br>
      <br>
      [0008] At many places in the world, particularly in semi arid or
      arid regions, such as, for example, in parts of Israel, Egypt, the
      Sahel zone or numerous hot deserts, which are at a significant
      distance from the sea, potable water supplies are not available,
      at least nor all year round. In addition to the transport of
      potable water, there is here only the possibility of providing
      potable water from moist air. <br>
      <br>
      [0009] Condensers are already known in many ways for extracting
      condensable water from atmospheric air having a refrigeratorable
      cold store, the relatively moist atmospheric air being cooled
      below the dew point (see DE-C-28 10 241, DD 285 142 A5). <br>
      <br>
      [0010] In addition, devices are also known which bind atmospheric
      water in an absorption phase by means of an adsorbent or absorbent
      material such as a salt, e.g. sodium chloride or the like. In this
      case the salt or the corresponding saline solution is generally
      stored in a liquid container, the water level or the topside,
      viewed in a vertical direction, of the salt or of the brine being
      considered as water-adsorbent or absorbent surface. In a
      desorption phase, this salt-water solution or brine is dehydrated
      for extracting the potable water and the salt is made available
      again for absorption (see, e.g., DE-C 2 660 068, DE 198 50 557
      A1). <br>
      <br>
      [0011] However, disadvantages of these methods or devices are the
      comparatively large construction size and the relatively low yield
      of potable water per unit volume of brine. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> <br>
      <br>
      [0012] In contrast to the prior art it is an object of the
      invention to provide a device for extracting water from
      atmospheric air having a free-flowing adsorbent or absorbent, in
      particular a saline solution having a hygroscopic salt for the
      adsorption or absorption of water, the adsorption or absorption
      being provided at least along an adsorption or absorption section,
      which device achieves a high yield of (potable) water per unit
      volume of the construction or of the absorbent/adsorbent, and
      possibly a stabilization of the process. <br>
      <br>
      [0013] An object of the invention is achieved starting with a
      device having a free-flowing adsorbent (3, 13) or an absorbent (3,
      13) in particular a saline solution (3, 13) having a hygroscopic
      salt for the adsorption or absorption of water, the adsorption or
      absorption being provided at least along an adsorption or
      absorption section (7). More particularly the invention pertains
      to a guide element (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) for guiding the adsorbent
      or absorbent and at least one metering unit having at least one
      orifice (6) for adding the saline solution (3) to the guide
      element and a metering unit for pressurizing the saline solution
      (3). <br>
      <br>
      [0014] Advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention
      are also provided by constructing the guide element (1, 16, 19,
      22, 24) in a U shape or a V shape, disposing the saline solution
      (3) as a liquid film on the guide element, providing a distributor
      element (10, 24) on the guide element (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) for the
      flat distribution of saline solution, constructing the
      distribution element (10, 24) as a spherical, cubic, conical,
      oval, egg-shaped, cuboidal and/or a polygonal body (10, 24)
      forming the distribution element (10, 24) as a net of a non woven
      or woven fabric, a leather hide, small hairs, fibers, pores,
      grooves, craters and/or hollows, forming the guide element (1, 16,
      19, 22, 24) in a plurality of bodies like a string of pearls,
      forming the guide element (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) as a rod 16 having
      numerous furrows (17) slots and/or grooves oriented along the rod
      axis, constructing the guide element as a corrugated plate having
      numerous corrugations (17) slots and/or grooves, providing for the
      transport of the adsorbent or absorbent along the guide element
      (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) in a substantially vertical direction,
      providing numerous guide elements (1, 16, 19, 22, 24) providing
      for brine drops along the adsorption or absorption section (7) for
      transporting the saline solution (3) having a least one metering
      unit with a least one metering orifice (6) for adding saline
      solution (3) to the guide element (1, 16, 19, 22, 24), having at
      least one pressure-generation unit for pressurizing the saline
      solution (3) disposed in a brine store (2) providing at least one
      heat-exchange unit for use of heat energy for desorption,
      providing for height and/or width adjustment of the device,
      mounting the device so as to be at least in part rotatable around
      an axis (27), providing an outer casing that is mounted to be
      rotatable around an axis (27), providing at least one air filter
      (15) for filtering atmospheric air (8) into the device, providing
      through-flow orifices having a smaller cross sectional area than
      the cross sectional area of the metering orifices and employing an
      adsorbent (3, 13) or absorbent (3, 13) in the device. <br>
      <br>
      [0015] Accordingly, an inventive device is distinguished in that
      the free-flowing adsorbent or absorbent is disposed at least along
      the adsorption or absorption section essentially on a guide
      element or a retention rail for guiding the adsorbent or
      absorbent, in particular on a presettable track. Using an
      inventive guide element, assembly and also retention or adhesion
      to the guide element is effected in such a manner as to
      substantially prevent disadvantageous blowing during flow through
      of the adsorption or absorption section due to the action of wind.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0016] Generally, shifting or motion/flowing of the adsorbent or
      absorbent along the adsorption or absorption section is provided,
      so that the motion or flowing of the adsorbent or absorbent is
      guided or conducted. <br>
      <br>
      [0017] Guiding in the context of the invention is taken to mean
      that the adsorbent or absorbent is guided or conducted at least in
      two, advantageously in three, directions orientated orthogonally
      to one another. This means that especially in the case of a guide
      element orientated at least in one direction, substantially
      vertically, owing to gravity, the adsorbent or absorbent is guided
      in what is termed the Y direction. In addition, by means of the
      guide element, the adsorbent or absorbent is guided or directed at
      least in what is termed the X direction and/or what is termed the
      Z direction. The Y, X or Z directions are here in each case
      disposed orthogonally to one another in a generally known manner.
      For example, the adsorbent or absorbent, in the case of a
      virtually vertically orientated and planar guide element, is
      guided or conducted, in addition to the Y direction, in addition
      also in the X direction or the Z direction in the meaning given
      above. In the case of a, e.g., virtually vertically orientated
      linear guide element, such as a rod, rope, etc., the adsorbent or
      absorbent, in addition to the Y direction, is also guided or
      conducted into the X direction and the Z direction. <br>
      <br>
      [0018] Advantageously, the adsorbent or absorbent is conducted or
      constructed on an outer surface or externally and/or as casing, of
      the guide element. This makes possible an advantageous contact
      with the atmospheric air. <br>
      <br>
      [0019] If appropriate, an adhesion element having an adhesion
      surface for adhesion of the free-flowing adsorbent or absorbent is
      provided at least along the adsorption or absorption section. By
      this means the adsorbent or absorbent is retained on the adhesion
      element in such a manner that it cannot be removed or blown away
      from the adhesion element by the force of wind or the like. <br>
      <br>
      [0020] In general, the adhesion element or guide element can be
      constructed so as to be substantially linear or else corrugated,
      curved and/or bent, so that it can be adapted flexibly to the most
      varied circumstances or spatial conditions. <br>
      <br>
      [0021] By means of this measure, according to the invention a
      substantially exactly defined track of the adsorbent or absorbent
      during water uptake from the air is achieved, the track of the
      adhesion element or guide element corresponding essentially to
      this, or being preset by this. As a result, without great
      expenditure, a disadvantageous change in the adsorption or
      absorption section of the adsorbent or absorbent is effectively
      prevented, so that as optimum as possible water uptake is
      achieved. <br>
      <br>
      [0022] The adhesion element, or the retention rail, or the guide
      element, is advantageously constructed as string and/or rope
      and/or wire and/or woven fabric and/or chain and/or tube and/or
      rod and/or pole. By this means, an adhesion element or guide
      element which is particularly simple to produce or assemble can be
      achieved. The adsorbent or adsorbent can be disposed in the form
      of a (partial) casing around the adhesion element or guide
      element, so that a particularly high surface area actively
      absorbing or absorbing water is achieved. This produces an
      actively water-absorbing surface area of the saline solution which
      is as large as possible. <br>
      <br>
      [0023] In a particular variant of the invention, the adhesion
      element or guide element or the retention rail can be constructed
      as U- and/or V-shaped element or rail. By means of this variant of
      the invention, a particularly exact direction of the adsorbent or
      absorbent on the preset track during the adsorption/adsorption can
      be achieved. <br>
      <br>
      [0024] In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the
      adsorbent/absorbent or the saline solution is disposed at least on
      the retention rail or on the adhesion element/guide element as
      liquid film or liquid wetting. By this means, a relatively
      extensive water-absorbing surface can be achieved. Furthermore, an
      advantageous ratio of liquid volume to actively water-absorbing
      liquid surface area is achieved. This leads to a particularly
      effective water extraction by the device according to the
      invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0025] Generally, there is the connection that the greater the
      water-absorbing surface area of the saline solution is, the more
      advantageous or greater is the water absorption and/or the
      efficiency of the inventive device. Generally, maximizing the
      water-absorbing surface area of the saline solution, in particular
      per unit volume, is to be aimed at. <br>
      <br>
      [0026] Preferably, the adhesion element/guide element or the
      retention rail has at least one distribution element for the
      planar distribution or for the surface enlargement of the saline
      solution. By this means, the planar development of the liquid film
      or the wetting of the wall, can advantageously be implemented.
      Corresponding designs of the adhesion element or guide element
      achieve in a particularly simple manner a correspondingly
      advantageous water-absorbing surface. <br>
      <br>
      [0027] In a particular development of the invention, the
      distribution element is constructed as spherical and/or cubic
      and/or conical and/or oval and/or cuboidal and/or polygonal body.
      The absorbent/adsorbent or the saline solution flows past such an
      adhesion element or guide element or bodies disposed on the
      retention rail, so that its or their surface area is critically
      enlarged and thus the water uptake is improved. <br>
      <br>
      [0028] Advantageously, the distribution element comprises a net
      and/or a nonwoven and/or a woven fabric and/or a leather hide
      and/or small hairs and/or fibers and/or pores and/or grooves
      and/or craters and/or hollows. For example, in the case of a
      nonwoven, woven fabric, leather or the like, the extensive
      implementation of the surface according to the invention is
      advantageously implemented, in particular, by means of capillary
      forces and/or surface effects. <br>
      <br>
      [0029] The distribution element can consist, e.g., of plastic,
      clay and/or glass. For example, the distribution element or the
      bodies can be glued, sprayed, pressed or comparatively simply
      fixed to the adhesion element or guide element. Between two
      distribution elements, spaces such as sleeves or the like may be
      provided. <br>
      <br>
      [0030] If appropriate, the distribution element is implemented as
      porous, sponge-like or comparably permeably constructed body.
      Possibly, the surface of the distribution element can be roughened
      or made to be microporous. In general, it is advantageous to adapt
      the adhesion element or guide element and/or distribution element
      to the adsorbent/absorbent or the saline solution, e.g. to the
      viscosity, surface tension, etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an advantageous variant of the invention, the adhesion
      element or guide element is constructed as what is called a string
      of pearls having numerous bodies. An advantageously simple surface
      enlargement can be achieved by appropriately numerous bodies which
      are disposed along the guide element. <br>
      <br>
      [0032] Possibly, the adhesion element or guide element or the
      retention rail is constructed having advantageous guide
      structures, in particular as a rod having numerous furrows and/or
      slots and/or grooves orientated in the direction of the rod axis.
      An appropriately furrowed rod, e.g., likewise has a relatively
      high surface area and is also simple to produce, e.g. as
      injection-molded or deep-drawn element. In addition, the guide
      structures improve the guidance or retention of the
      adsorbent/absorbent to the guide element according to the
      invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0033] Especially, alternatively to this, the adhesion element or
      guide element or the retention rail can be constructed having
      advantageous guide structures, in particular as a corrugated plate
      having numerous corrugations and/or slots and/or grooves. A
      corresponding plate can be produced at least just as simply, and
      in addition also has a relatively large surface area. <br>
      <br>
      [0034] Generally, the corrugations and/or furrows and/or slots
      and/or grooves can have hollows and/or bulges and/or humps or the
      like, so that the surface area of the corresponding guide element
      is additionally increased, which leads to an even better water
      uptake by the adsorbent/absorbent. <br>
      <br>
      [0035] In addition, the inventive bodies, hollows, bulges or humps
      of the adhesion element or guide element extend the
      adsorption/absorption section and thus advantageously the
      residence time of the adsorbent/absorbent, which results in an
      improved water uptake of the apparatus. In principle, other
      alternative and/or further advantageous surface-area-increasing
      measures or elements can also be used according to the invention.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0036] In a preferred manner, the transport direction of the
      adsorbent or absorbent is orientated along the adhesion element or
      guide element or along the retention rail essentially in a
      vertical direction. By this means, an advantageous transport of
      the free-flowing adsorbent/absorbent or the saline solution can be
      achieved along the adsorption section by means of gravity. This
      measure makes possible a particularly simple operation of the
      inventive device. <br>
      <br>
      [0037] In a particular variant of the invention, numerous adhesion
      elements or guide elements or retention rails are provided. By
      this means the water-absorbing surface area according to the
      invention can be advantageously enlarged to a particularly great
      extent or in a simple manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] If appropriate, a plurality of vertically or horizontally
      orientated adhesion elements or guide elements are disposed in a
      horizontal direction next to one another. Preferably, numerous
      distribution elements are disposed in a vertical direction one
      above the other. By this means, an advantageous cascade can be
      achieved, the saline solution flowing or being transported by
      means of gravity from a first distribution element to a second
      distribution element disposed beneath, etc. For example, the
      saline solution flows along the surface of the adhesion element or
      guide element, the adsorbent/absorbent or the saline solution
      flowing over one distribution element or inventive body after the
      other. <br>
      <br>
      [0039] In a particular development of the invention, brine drops
      are provided at least along the adsorption or absorption section
      for transporting the saline solution. This can mean, inter alia,
      that the saline solution drips with as many drops as possible,
      e.g., from at least one brine store, preferably disposed in the
      upper region of the inventive device, onto the adhesion
      element/guide element, or the numerous adhesion elements/guide
      elements, which drops slide downward along the adhesion element or
      guide element. The brine of the brine store is generally a
      virtually saturated saline solution. <br>
      <br>
      [0040] Advantageously, in the inventive variants, the
      water-absorbing surface of the saline solution comprises at least
      the drop surface. For example, in the case of several million
      drops per cubic meter, this advantageous measure gives a
      significant enlargement of the water-absorbing surface area which
      further improves the yield or the efficiency of the inventive
      device. <br>
      <br>
      [0041] Preferably, at least one metering unit having at least one
      metering orifice is present for adding the brine drops to a guide
      element. In this case, in particular from the brine store, the
      saline solution is added by means of the metering orifice of the
      adhesion element or guide element. A metering unit enables,
      especially together with an open-loop or closed-loop control unit,
      a substantially automated mode of operation of the device
      according to the invention. For this, advantageously, the most
      varied sensors and actuators are to be provided which measure at
      least relative atmospheric humidity, temperature, flow rate, brine
      concentration, flow velocity, air pressure and/or brine pressure.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0042] In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the
      metering unit has at least one pressure-generation unit for
      pressurizing the saline solution disposed in a brine store. Using
      a corresponding pressure-generation unit, such as, e.g., a pump,
      the saline solution in the brine store can be pressurized for
      example in such a manner that the amount of saline solution added
      can be adapted, in particular, to the relative atmospheric
      humidity. <br>
      <br>
      [0043] Preferably, the addition is performed in such a manner that
      the saline solution, pulsed, gives off numerous drops through
      numerous metering orifices at correspondingly numerous adhesion
      elements or guide elements. For this, the pressure-generation unit
      pressurizes the saline solution in a pulsed manner, or alternately
      at a high pressure and a lower pressure. This ensures that
      substantially individual drops slide down the adhesion elements or
      guide elements one after the other and thus form an advantageously
      large active surface area or slide from distribution element to
      distribution element, in particular from body to body, according
      to the invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0044] For example, the number of brine drops per unit time is
      adapted to the relative humidity of the atmospheric air, the more
      brine drops are generated or are added to the adhesion
      elements/guide elements, the higher is the relative atmospheric
      humidity. Advantageously, this adaptation, in particular of the
      control of the pressure generated by the pressure-generation unit,
      can be combined with a wind energy-generation unit such as a wind
      turbine or the like. <br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a particular development of the invention, at least one
      air filter is provided for filtering the atmospheric air flowing
      into the device. This can at least partially prevent or reduce
      contamination of the adsorbent/absorbent by dust, windborne sand
      or the like, which makes possible a relatively fault-free mode of
      operation of the device according to the invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0046] Preferably, the air filter has through-flow orifices, the
      through-flow orifices having a smaller cross sectional area than
      the cross sectional area of the metering orifices. By means of
      this measure, impairment or blockage of the metering orifices by
      particles introduced with the atmospheric air, such as windborne
      sand or the like, can be very largely prevented. This decisively
      increases the operational reliability of the inventive device,
      without significant expenditure. This measure is also of
      particular advantage in a device according to application 103 09
      110.6 of the applicant. <br>
      <br>
      [0047] In principle, the saline solution flowing down along the
      adhesion element/guide element or the distribution element
      generally automatically cleans it from contamination such as dust
      deposits, windborne sand, etc., as a result of which a
      self-cleaning system can be achieved. This additionally increases
      the operation reliability of the plant. <br>
      <br>
      [0048] Advantageously, a holding device of the adhesion elements
      or guide elements has at least one support column. Preferably, the
      adhesion elements or guide elements are disposed in at least one
      through-flow element constructed as a vane, in particular the vane
      being able to swing together with the holding device, or about an
      axis of rotation. Preferably, two vane elements are provided which
      are able to rotate about an intermediately disposed axis of
      rotation and/or holding device or support column. <br>
      <br>
      [0049] For example, the support column is disposed in the central
      region of the plant or in the region of an axis of rotation. If
      appropriate, the support column is constructed as an extrusion
      pressed element, as a result of which a relatively economically
      expedient design of the holding device can be effected. <br>
      <br>
      [0050] In principle, the plant or the vane can be constructed so
      as to be able to swing as a function of the wind direction. For
      this, an advantageous control unit, in particular having a wind
      direction-detection element, is present. For example in the case
      of relatively high wind strengths, such as in a storm, etc., the
      control unit can place the plant or the vane(s) with a relatively
      small, in particular closed, cross sectional area into the wind.
      At relatively low wind strengths, or in a virtually still wind,
      the plant or the vane(s) is/are to be placed with a relatively
      large through-flowable cross sectional area into the wind. <br>
      <br>
      [0051] Preferably, the saline solution is fed at a first, in
      particular virtually saturated, salt concentration of the adhesion
      element or guide element from the brine store. For example, the
      holding device, in particular the support column, comprises the
      brine store. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, at
      least one removal element for removing the saline solution at a
      second salt concentration is provided, the second salt
      concentration being substantially lower than the first salt
      concentration. <br>
      <br>
      [0052] If appropriate, the saline solution flows through or
      impinges a plurality of adhesion elements or guide elements in
      series, and is stored or collected in a collecting element or
      second brine store at the second salt concentration. The adhesion
      elements or guide elements connected in series form, at least
      together with the brine feeder and the collecting element, an
      advantageous module. Advantageously, a plurality of modules are
      provided, if appropriate, viewed in the vertical direction,
      disposed one above the other and/or adjacently. Advantageously,
      the modules are connected, and the saline solution flows through
      them, in parallel. In this case the modules or individual saline
      solutions are generally combined, the saline solutions of the
      individual modules mixing and if appropriate being intermediately
      stored in a storage reservoir. <br>
      <br>
      [0053] Preferably, at least one concentration unit is provided for
      concentrating the saline solution from the second salt
      concentration to the first salt concentration. For example, in
      this case, the water is at least in part desorbed. By means of
      this measure, advantageous water or potable water is separated off
      from the saline solution and can be fed to a use or utilization.
      Frequently, the water extracted by this means is used as potable
      water and/or irrigation water. <br>
      <br>
      [0054] Advantageously, the concentration unit comprises at least
      one mechanical filter, sieve or the like, which effectively
      removes or retains contaminants or particles, in particular
      upstream of the concentration stage in the direction of flow. <br>
      <br>
      [0055] If appropriate, the concentration unit has at least one
      cyclone and/or a semipermeable membrane for producing the water or
      potable water. Preferably, the concentration unit comprises at
      least one evaporator for at least partial evaporation of the
      saline solution. In this case, in particular, an if appropriate
      refrigeratable condensation unit is provided for condensing the
      water vapor and producing the water. <br>
      <br>
      [0056] The use of an evaporator has in particular the advantage
      that in arid or semiarid areas, heat energy or solar energy is
      available particularly simply in a sufficient amount and using
      extensively proven techniques. Frequently, in this case, use is
      made of corresponding energy stores in the most differing
      variants. <br>
      <br>
      [0057] In general, e.g. a substantially continuous day and/or
      night operation of the device according to the invention can be
      effected. <br>
      <br>
      [0058] In principle, using the invention, a marked enlargement of
      the surface area actively absorbing the atmospheric water can be
      achieved, which leads to a decisive improvement in the yield per
      unit volume of the device. Possibly, a substantially greater
      throughput or throughflow of atmospheric air per unit time can be
      achieved, so that the yield per unit time can be correspondingly
      increased. This leads to a substantial increase in the efficiency
      or economics of the inventive device. <br>
      <br>
      [0059] Preferably, a skin is formed for encasing or protecting the
      device and/or the adhesion elements/guide elements or modules, at
      least in part as a skin which can be orientated into a wind
      direction. By this measure, an adaptation to unfavorable
      atmospheric conditions such as storm etc, can be effected. For
      example, at least a part of the skin can be implemented from
      numerous lamellae which are mounted so as to be able to rotate.
      These lamellae are generally directed into the wind direction, so
      that an advantageous directing of the wind or of the air to be
      dehydrated can be effected. <br>
      <br>
      [0060] Alternatively, or in combination therewith, can also be an
      outer skin mounted so as to be able to rotate having a generally
      immobile adsorption/absorption region or adsorption/absorption
      section. In this case, the outer skin, can advantageously have
      flaps which can close or open the sorption section and can be
      orientated to the wind flow. <br>
      <br>
      [0061] In a preferred development of the invention, the device,
      considered over the cross section, has a substantially equal
      through-flow depth, so that the moist air, on flowing through,
      generally flows over the entire cross section past relatively
      equally many or equally wide retention rails. As a result, the air
      within the inventive device is relatively uniformly dehydrated. <br>
      <br>
      [0062] Preferably, the skin has flaps or vane elements which, as
      collecting elements, direct atmospheric air into the device
      according to the invention. If appropriate, the adhesion elements
      or vane elements are constructed in such a manner that they close
      one side of the device in the event of disadvantageous climatic
      conditions. For example, by this means, in the event of sandstorm
      or the like, in particular together with the skin, protection of
      the retention rails, air filters etc. can be effected before
      impairment. As already described above, they can, if appropriate,
      be orientated in the direction of the wind flow. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] Advantageously, at least one air control unit is provided
      for controlled inflow of air to at least one guide element. By
      this means, generally, based on the natural wind inflow, in
      addition relatively moist air can be fed to the guide elements, in
      particular in the event of wind calm or insufficient wind
      velocities, so that the water extraction is further improved. <br>
      <br>
      [0064] In an advantageous variant of the invention, the adhesion
      element/guide element or the retention rail is constructed, in
      particular, as two-dimensional woven fabric, net or the like.
      Here, use can be made of preexisting elements, preferably
      commercially available fabrics such as material webs, nets, etc.
      For example, these woven fabrics or nets can consist of synthetic
      fibers and/or if appropriate, also of natural fibers. By this
      inventive variant, a particularly extensive adhesion element or
      guide element having innumerable individual longitudinal and
      transverse rails and nodal points can be implemented, by which a
      particularly large active surface area of the adsorbent/absorbent
      or saline solution can be achieved. In this case, the individual
      filaments of the woven fabric or nets can be constructed in such a
      manner that the saline solution, by means of capillary forces or
      the like, ensures wetting of the adhesion element or guide element
      as far as possible over the whole surface. <br>
      <br>
      [0065] The distribution element is preferably constructed as woven
      fabric, net or the like, which in particular is disposed on an
      inventive plate, e.g. on the rear and/or front of the plate. By
      this means a layer-like adhesion element or guide element can be
      implemented. For example, three layers are provided, two outer
      fabric or net layers, and, disposed in between, an inner,
      stabilizing, if appropriate shape-giving layer, which consists,
      e.g., of metal, plastic etc. In an inner layer a heat exchanger is
      preferably provided which makes available the liberated reaction
      enthalpy, e.g. of desorption. <br>
      <br>
      [0066] In principle, an adhesion element/guide element or a
      retention rail can have at least one branching element or a
      switch, so that in the direction of flow of the
      adsorbent/absorbent or of the saline solution from a single-track
      a two- or multitrack adhesion element or guide element is formed.
      By this means an advantageous adaptation to the saline solution
      volume increase existing along the adsorption/absorption section
      due to the water uptake can be achieved. Possibly, the cross
      section of the inventive device, viewed in the vertical direction,
      exhibits a widening from top to bottom, so that the cross
      sectional area of the region of the adhesion/guide element or
      adhesion/guide elements is adapted to the volume increase of the
      saline solution. For example, the cross sectional area, at least
      in the region of the adhesion element or guide element, has the
      form of a cone, truncated cone, triangle, trapeze etc. It is
      conceivable that as branching element, a substantially
      horizontally orientated disc is used. <br>
      <br>
      [0067] In the variant of the invention in which, as adhesion
      element or guide element, use is made of a woven fabric, net etc.,
      a branching element or switch can be implemented very particularly
      simply. For example, two guide elements or fabric webs or nets are
      fixed to one another or sewn to one another. If appropriate, at
      different heights of the device, i.e. after different sections in
      the direction of flow, guide elements or nets or woven fabric webs
      are fixed or sewn to a substantially continuous woven fabric web
      or net. <br>
      <br>
      [0068] Advantageously, two-dimensional adhesion elements or guide
      elements such as plates, woven fabrics or nets, can, at least
      during the adsorption/absorption phase, be orientated in the
      direction of, or somewhat at an angle to, the air flowing through.
      As a result, the air flowing through can flow past both the front
      and also the rear side of the plate, woven fabric web or net, and
      give off water to the saline solution. <br>
      <br>
      [0069] Generally, as hygroscopic salt of the saline solution,
      selection may be made from very different substances, e.g. sodium
      chloride, potassium acetate or lithium chloride. The advantageous
      lithium chloride can absorb water from atmospheric air in part
      still down to approximately 12% relative atmospheric humidity. In
      addition, lithium chloride takes up water from the atmospheric air
      even when there is a covering of the salt with water or saline
      solution. The absorption of the atmospheric water by the saline
      solution ends in this case at a ratio of salt to water of about
      one to four weight units. <br>
      <br>
      [0070] Advantageously, in a device for extracting water from
      atmospheric air having a free flowing adsorbent (3, 13) or an
      absorbent (3, 13) in particular a saline solution having a
      hygroscopic salt for the adsorption or absorption of water
      includes at least one heat exchange unit is provided for utilizing
      heat energy for desorption. For example, the heat energy of the
      atmospheric air and/or the reaction enthalpy of the
      adsorption/absorption is utilized by means of the heat exchanger
      for the concentration unit or the evaporator, energy supply of the
      device or the like. By this means an advantageous energy
      management system can be implemented, so that only a very little
      external energy needs to be supplied to the device according to
      the invention by means of wind, sun, a power connection to the
      public power grid, block-type combined heat and power stations
      etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0071] For example, at least one heat exchanger can be disposed
      between two adhesion element/guide element plates, within a
      retention rail rod and/or around numerous adhesion elements/guide
      elements or retention rails, in particular in the region of the
      outer skin of the device. <br>
      <br>
      [0072] In principle, in the device according to the invention, as
      far as possible only one fluid or liquid i.e. free-flowing,
      absorbent is used. A correspondingly free-flowing or liquid
      absorbent or saline solutions having differing salt concentrations
      are distinguished by a particularly simple possible transport
      method. For example, for the active transport of the saline
      solution, commercially conventional transport devices such as
      pumps or the like can be used. <br>
      <br>
      [0073] In an advantageous embodiment for achieving the object of
      the invention, the device for extracting water from atmospheric
      air having a free flowing adsorbent (3, 13) or an absorbent (3,
      13) in particular a saline solution having a hygroscopic salt for
      the adsorption or absorption of water includes a flexible adhesion
      element or guide element, in particular a string, rope, wire,
      woven fabric, etc., is provided and/or the device is constructed
      to be height-adjustable and/or width-adjustable. By this means the
      device according to the invention can, where required, in
      particular for mobile applications during the transport phase, be
      constructed so as to be foldable, collapsible, or folded away.
      Also the device can be constructed as a device capable of
      telescoping such as, e.g., currently known tent attachments for
      cars etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0074] Possibly, a liquid store is used for the adsorbent or
      absorbent, in particular the saline solution, advantageously a
      water-absorbing or -adsorbing surface of the saline solution being
      disposed at least on two opposite sides of a wall of the liquid
      store. By means of this measure, a significant enlargement of the
      surface actively absorbing atmospheric water is achieved, which
      leads to an improvement of the yield per unit volume of the
      device. Possibly, a significantly greater throughput or
      throughflow of atmospheric air per unit time can be realized than
      in the prior art, so that the yield per unit time can be
      correspondingly increased. This leads to a substantial increase in
      the efficiency and economics of the inventive device. <br>
      <br>
      [0075] For example, the liquid or saline solution is stored or
      disposed in a liquid store or on/above a wall of the liquid store.
      In this case the saline liquid is also stored on the outside or
      below the wall of the liquid store, so that the water-absorbing
      surface is advantageously extensive. <br>
      <br>
      [0076] If appropriate, the water-absorbing surface area
      corresponds to approximately 30% or 50% or 80% of a side surface
      or of the entire wall. Advantageously, the water-absorbing surface
      of the saline solution or saline liquid extends at least over
      virtually an entire side surface or the entire wall. This produces
      as large an actively water-absorbing surface area of the saline
      solution as possible. Generally, there is the relationship that
      the greater the water-absorbing surface area of the saline
      solution, the more advantageous or greater is the water absorption
      and/or the efficiency of the inventive device. Generally,
      maximization of the water-absorbing surface area of the saline
      solution is to be aimed at, in particular per unit volume. <br>
      <br>
      [0077] In a particular development of the invention, the saline
      solution is fashioned as liquid film or liquid wetting at least at
      one, or preferably at both, of the side surfaces of the liquid
      store. As a result a comparatively extensive water-absorbing
      surface can be achieved. Furthermore, an advantageous ratio of
      liquid volume to actively water-absorbing liquid surface area is
      achieved. This leads to a particularly effective water extraction
      by the device according to the invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0078] If appropriate, the inventive water-absorbing surface of
      the saline solution, to be provided on opposite sides of the wall
      of the liquid store, is achieved by an overflow, or saline
      solution flowing over an edge and/or end of the wall and along the
      outer wall. Alternatively, or in combination therewith, the wall
      has numerous through-flow orifices for through-flow of the saline
      solution from a first side to this opposite side of the wall. By
      this measure, advantageously, an extensive water-absorbing
      surface, in particular fashioned as liquid film, is fashioned on
      the side opposite the first side. <br>
      <br>
      [0079] In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the wall is
      fashioned as mesh, a perforated sheet, a net, a nonwoven, a woven
      fabric, a membrane and/or a leather hide. Corresponding
      embodiments of the wall effect in a particularly simple manner a
      correspondingly advantageous water-absorbing surface. For example
      in the case of a nonwoven, woven fabric, leather or the like, the
      extensive implementation of the surface according to the invention
      is advantageously effected especially by means of capillary
      forces, surface effects etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] Advantageously, at least on one side, e.g. on the outer
      side and/or bottom side of the wall of the liquid store, a
      distribution element for the two-dimensional distribution of the
      saline solution is disposed. By this means, the planar fashioning
      of the liquid film or of the wetting of the wall is advantageously
      effected. <br>
      <br>
      [0081] Alternatively, or in combination to the correspondingly
      fashioned wall of the liquid store, the distribution element is
      fashioned as a mesh, a perforated sheet, a net, a nonwoven, a
      woven fabric, a membrane and/or a leather hide. If appropriate, a
      layering of the respective layer-type wall having the distribution
      element is effected. For example, the distribution element is
      detachably or non-detachably, in particular in a planar manner,
      fixed to the wall. Possibly, in each case at least one
      distribution element is disposed on both opposite sides of the
      wall according to the invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0082] Frequently, the liquid store can be fashioned as a vessel,
      container or the like enclosing at least in part the saline
      solution. Advantageously, the liquid store is essentially
      fashioned as planar, substantionally level or flat disc. In this
      case the saline solution is stored, inter alia, by means of its
      surface tension, capillary forces or the like. For example, the
      storage is performed on the topside, viewed in the vertical
      direction, predominantly by the surface tension or flowability of
      the saline solution. <br>
      <br>
      [0083] In the case of a liquid store fashioned as a disc, in a
      particularly simple manner, a relatively extensive water-absorbing
      surface is fashioned. In this case, the inventive water-absorbing
      surface area can approximately correspond to twice the area of a
      side of the wall or about to the entire wall area, e.g. including
      end sides. In addition, a liquid store fashioned as disc can
      minimize the required construction volume or can maximize the
      water-absorbing surface area per unit volume. In this case the
      saline solution can preferably be fashioned as liquid film or
      wetting on all sides, e.g. not only above, but also below the
      disc. <br>
      <br>
      [0084] In principle, the wall of the store can consist at least in
      part of porous, in particular sintered, material, so that the
      volume enclosed or fashioned by the wall is effected as store. <br>
      <br>
      [0085] In general, precisely for mobile applications, inventive
      devices can be integrated in an, e.g., commercially conventional
      container for trucks, ships etc. For example, at least a part of
      the container can be fashioned so as to be able to be run out or
      made (width- or height-) adjustable, so that the
      adsorption/absorption section can be advantageously lengthened
      during the sorption phase compared with the idle time of the
      plant. For example, correspondingly mobile plants can be used
      locally and very flexibly with respect to time for (potable) water
      supply after natural disasters, accidents or other impairments or
      destruction of the general water supply. <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING BEST MODE </b><br>
      <br>
      [0101] FIG. 1 shows a device according to the invention having a
      plurality of adhesion elements/guide elements 1 or retention rails
      1 fashioned as a string of pearls 1. In this case, the entire
      plant can be fashioned, for example, in a comparable manner to, or
      combined with, the plant or the system according to the device set
      forth in the prior art or application 103 09 110.6 of the
      applicant <br>
      <br>
      [0102] In an upper brine store 2 is stored the virtually saturated
      saline solution 3. Through a first inlet 4, the saline solution 3,
      such as e.g. LiCl is charged into the store 2. By means of a
      second inlet 5 a pressurized medium, e.g. compressed air or the
      like, is connected to the saline solution 3. The
      pressure-generation unit which is not shown in more detail
      produces, in particular a pulsed overpressure in the store 2, so
      that the saline solution 3 passes through metering orifices 6,
      e.g. as drops, and flow along the adhesion elements 1 or guide
      elements 1 downward to an adsorption/absorption region 7, or are
      conducted downward by the adhesion elements 1 or guide elements 1.
      The adsorption/absorption region 7 forms the adsorption/absorption
      section 7 along which the uptake of water from atmospheric air 8
      takes place. From the device, somewhat dehumidified air 9 flows. <br>
      <br>
      [0103] The retention rails 1 have distribution elements 10 or
      bodies 10 which ensure an enlargement of the active surface taking
      up water of the saline solution 3. The string of pearls 1 or guide
      elements 1 are fixed or tensioned, e.g. by means of springs 11, so
      that the exact orientation or stabilization of the guide elements
      1 is ensured, even at very high flow velocities of the air 8, 9.
      Without more detailed illustration, a guide element 1 can also be
      stretched only at the top or bottom by one spring 11. <br>
      <br>
      [0104] The pearls 10 or bodies 10 can be fashioned as spheres,
      ovals, etc. and, for better adhesion of the saline solution 3, be
      provided with or without grooves, hollows, fibers, small hairs,
      pores etc. Alternatively, or in combination therewith, they can
      also be fashioned so as to be roughened or microporous. The bodies
      10 can be fashioned from plastic, clay, silica gel, metal,
      ceramics and/or glass. The exact design of the bodies 10 can be
      modified to adapt the residence time of the saline solution 1 to
      its surface. <br>
      <br>
      [0105] In the lower region of the device, a second brine store 12
      is provided for storing or collecting the saline solution 13
      somewhat diluted by the water uptake. The store 12 thus collects
      the saline solution 13 of the numerous retention rails 1 and
      delivers this solution 13 by means of an outlet 14 e.g. to a
      concentration unit which is not shown in more detail, such as an
      evaporator, membrane unit, cyclone etc. If appropriate, for this a
      pump can advantageously be used. Possibly, the saline solution 13,
      in particular upstream of the concentration unit, is at least in
      part freed from dirt particles by means of a fine filter or the
      like. <br>
      <br>
      [0106] In addition, the device has air filters 15 which
      substantially retain or filter out from the air 8 particles such
      as dust, windborne sand etc. The pore width of the air filter 15
      in this case is advantageously less than the width of the
      throughway between the guide elements 1 and the orifice 6. This
      measure very largely prevents blockage of the orifice 6. <br>
      <br>
      [0107] FIG. 2 shows a retention rail fashioned as furrowed rod 16.
      The rod 16 has numerous furrows 17 in which downward-flowing
      saline solution 3 is conducted. The furrows 17 in addition have a
      plurality of bulges 18 which enlarge the active surface area and
      also lead to an extension of the absorption section or increase
      the residence time in the absorption region 7. Within the rod 16
      is provided a part of a heat exchanger 23 which removes the
      liberated heat of reaction for the desorption. <br>
      <br>
      [0108] FIG. 3 shows a corrugated plate 19 which has numerous
      grooves 17 in which the saline solution 3 is conducted. The
      grooves 17 again have bulges 18, so that the active surface area
      is enlarged and also the residence time of the solution in the
      absorption region is increased or the flow velocity is
      advantageously reduced. <br>
      <br>
      [0109] According to FIG. 3 it can be seen that the air 8 flows
      substantially along the plate 19, so that the saline solution 3
      preferably flowing down on both sides of the plate 19 can take up
      water. Corresponding planar adhesion elements 19 or guide elements
      19 can generally be orientated or turned into the respective wind
      direction. The brine or saline solution 3 is fed to the adhesion
      elements/guide elements or retention rails 1, 16, 19, preferably
      as drops of saline solution 3, and flows owing to gravity down the
      track preset by the retention rails into the store 12. For reasons
      of clarity, no drops are drawn. <br>
      <br>
      [0110] Air 8 at a certain atmospheric humidity flows on or past
      the adhesion elements/guide elements 1, 16, 19, the hygroscopic
      brine or saline solution 3 in part absorbing the water present in
      the air 8 and thus being diluted by the dehumidification of the
      air 8. This means that a salt concentration of the brine or saline
      solution 3 decreases on the absorption section owing to the water
      uptake. The salt concentration is the quotient of an amount of
      salt per unit volume (unit: g/cm.sup.3) . As salt, use is
      preferably made of lithium chloride which can remove water from
      the air 8 as far as an atmospheric humidity of approximately 12%.
      In addition, lithium chloride can absorb water up to a ratio of
      one part by weight of salt to four parts by weight of water. <br>
      <br>
      [0111] The water vapor of the air 8 is absorbed at a surface of
      the brine 3. Owing to the relatively large area of the adhesion
      element/guide elements 1, 16, 19 and the comparatively small store
      volume, an advantageous surface-volume ratio is effected, so that
      the water is absorbed particularly efficiently. For example, the
      brine 3 in this case is stored as a comparatively thin liquid film
      or wetting on the surface of the adhesion element/guide elements
      1, 16, 19 or bodies 10. If appropriate, the saline solution 3 is
      stored intermediately within a porous or permeable adhesion
      element/guide element 1, 16, 19 or body 10. In addition, the
      surface F.sub.3 of the drops is fashioned as active
      water-absorbing surface, so that the absorption is further
      improved. <br>
      <br>
      [0112] The rod 16 or the plate 19 or the bodies 10 each have, if
      appropriate, a nonwoven, etc., which is not shown in more detail.
      By this means a distribution of the saline solution 3 as uniform
      as possible over the entire surface is achieved. This ensures that
      the water-absorbing surface area is implemented as extensively as
      possible. <br>
      <br>
      [0113] In general, the device according to FIG. 1 or 6 can have a
      roof, without more precise illustration. On the roof, already
      commercially conventional elements can be provided for extracting
      solar energy or supplying energy to the device, e.g. photovoltaic
      elements and/or solar collectors. In addition, if appropriate,
      rainwater arising can be advantageously collected by means of the
      roof and fed to a water store which is not illustrated in more
      detail. Possibly, the roof which is fashioned, e.g., as a cockpit
      or the like, can comprise, inter alia, a viewing platform, a
      restaurant, equipment room and/or control room. <br>
      <br>
      [0114] Preferably the saline solution 3 can have additives, e.g.
      for the prevention of microbial infection, to influence surface
      tension etc. The brine or saline solution 3, 13 is generally
      circulated or recirculated and the water taken up is, on passage
      along the adhesion elements/guide elements 1, 16, 19,
      advantageously separated off from the brine 3, in particular by
      means of an evaporator and/or cyclone. <br>
      <br>
      [0115] In addition, in principle the air 8 can flow by means of
      natural flow or movement through the device or along the adhesion
      elements/guide elements 1, 16, 19 and/or by means of at least one
      advantageous pressure- or flow-generation unit, such as a fan, a
      turbine, a blower or the like. In the case of the last-mentioned
      variant, preferably, at least one flow-directing device is to be
      provided. <br>
      <br>
      [0116] FIG. 4 shows a further variant, which is not true to scale,
      of a guide element 22, FIG. 4a showing a plan view onto a sphere
      plane and FIG. 4b showing a cut-away side view onto a plurality of
      sphere planes. These adhesion elements 22 or guide elements 22 is
      implemented as a sphere series 22 interrupted a plurality of
      times, the spheres 24 being arranged in the space by plates 25.
      The spheres 24 are disposed or fixed on a substantially planar
      plate 25 orientated in a virtually horizontal plane having
      numerous orifices 20 or stamped cut-outs 20. The orifices 20 have
      lands 21, by which the spheres 24 can be fixed. For example, the
      spheres 24 are pressed and/or glued into the orifices 20. <br>
      <br>
      [0117] The air 8 in this variant can flow through the free
      intermediate space between the sphere 24. In this case the saline
      solution 3 is conducted along the adhesion elements 1 or guide
      elements 1 by means of the spheres 24 and distributed over the
      sphere surface, so that, in particular, a significant enlargement
      of the active surface area is achieved. The comparatively small
      vertical distances between two sphere planes and the sphere shape
      ensures that the brine drops 3 dripping off from a sphere 24 meet
      a sphere 24 disposed beneath, and thus the vertical guidance
      according to the invention is implemented. <br>
      <br>
      [0118] FIG. 5 shows three variants of the structure of a device
      according to the invention in diagrammatic plan view. According to
      variant 5a, the device has a rectangular cross section. The outer
      skin in this case advantageously has rotatable flaps 26 which can
      be used, e.g., not only for closing the side walls in the event of
      unfavorable climatic conditions such as sandstorms, etc., but also
      for directing or collecting the air streams. <br>
      <br>
      [0119] Corresponding constructions (see FIGS. 5a, 5b, 5c; in part
      without more detailed illustration) are advantageously mounted so
      as to be able to rotate about a vertical axis 27, especially in
      the case of two-dimensional adhesion elements, or guide elements,
      such as vertically disposed plates, fabric webs etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0120] According to FIGS. 5b and 5c, round cross sections of but
      also square (see FIG. 5c) outer skins being able to be
      implemented. The flaps 26 are adapted in their shape in accordance
      with the design of the outer skin. Especially in the case of these
      two variants, the outer skin can be fashioned so as to be able to
      rotate together with the flaps 26 and the absorption region if
      appropriate can be fashioned to be immobile. <br>
      <br>
      [0121] In the FIGS. 6 and 7, a further variant of an inventive
      construction is diagrammatically illustrated. This essentially
      comprises two vanes 28 and a support column 29. In the patterns 28
      shown as vanes 28, numerous adhesion elements/guide elements or
      retention rails according to the invention are present. For
      example, the vanes 28 have a depth of some centimeters to some
      meters and/or a width or a height of if appropriate a plurality of
      meters. Possibly, the vanes have closing flaps or the like, for
      example comparable to those from FIG. 5 and/or as lamellae-like
      strips etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0122] The construction or the vanes 28 are advantageously mounted
      so as to be able to rotate together with or around the column 29
      or axis 27. In this case, preferably a pivoting range of about
      90.degree. C. is provided so that (inflowing) air 8 can flow
      virtually perpendicularly to or parallel to the vanes 28, relative
      to a cross sectional area 30 of the vanes 28. <br>
      <br>
      [0123] The perpendicular influent direction is advantageously
      provided in the operating case of dehumidifying the air 8 and in
      the case of very high wind velocities, the parallel flow direction
      of the vanes 28. Possibly, depending on the wind velocity, an
      (acute) angled orientation of the vanes 28 to the wind direction
      can be advantageous. The outer ends are advantageously fashioned
      in a manner expedient to flow or have corresponding wind directing
      or wind guidance elements. <br>
      <br>
      [0124] A further particular variant of the adhesion element 31 or
      guide element 31 according to the invention is shown as extract in
      FIG. 8. The adhesion elements 31 or guide element 31 is in this
      case fashioned as woven fabric 31 which is traversed or fixed by
      stretching elements 32. The woven fabric 31 essentially consists
      of textile woven fabric 31, a net 31, fiber composite 31 or the
      like. Possibly, in this case, commercially conventional woven
      fabric 31 is used so that an economically particularly expedient
      design can be effected. <br>
      <br>
      [0125] The stretching elements 32 are fashioned, e.g., as
      stretching rope or wire cable, rods or the like, which in part
      penetrate the fabric 31 and/or lie against the woven fabric 31 or
      support/fix this laterally. Possibly, the woven fabric 31 is
      disposed between two opposite elements 32. The stretching elements
      32 are advantageously fixed at the bottom and also at the top, and
      stretched without more detailed illustration into the directions
      Z. <br>
      <br>
      [0126] In the case of tensioned stretching elements 32, it is
      advantageous that if appropriate these can be fashioned at least
      in part to be flexible or elastic. As a result they are
      comparatively simple to mount and/or to be fashioned thinly, these
      nevertheless, by means of the stretching, ensuring an advantageous
      lateral stabilization of the woven fabric 31. Thus, in particular,
      relatively elastic or flexible woven fabric 31 can be used. <br>
      <br>
      [0127] FIG. 9 shows a further variant of the invention, the bodies
      10 being fashioned as spheres 10 having grooves 33. The grooves 33
      are preferably implemented in a spiral shape, which is clear,
      especially in the plan view FIG. 9c. As a result a spin or the
      like of the downward-flowing adsorbent or absorbent can be
      generated, so that a relatively strong wind does not blow the
      saline solution exclusively to one side of the body. By this
      means, even in the event of a comparatively strong wind, a
      relatively large active surface area of the saline solution is
      generated which improves the extraction of potable water from
      atmospheric air. FIG. 9a shows a "string of pearls" having bodies
      10 which have linear grooves 33. FIG. 9b a section through a body
      10 having grooves 33. <br>
      <br>
      [0128] FIG. 10 shows guide elements 1 which are disposed by way of
      example to form blocks A, B, C, D and have different bodies 10. In
      the abovementioned variants of the invention, essentially,
      exemplary spherical bodies 10 are set forth. The bodies 10 of the
      block A have an oval cross section. The bodies 10 of the block B
      are asymmetrically disposed on the guide element 1. The bodies 10
      of the block C are fashioned to be different sizes. The bodies 10
      and also the guide element 1 of the block D are produced by a
      roller method and preferably have cross sections having different
      widths. For example, in particular in the case of the
      last-mentioned variant, spiral or screw-shaped guide rails 1 can
      be generated. <br>
      <br>
      [0129] Generally, guide elements 1 and bodies 10 of any desired
      structures or shapes can be used and/or be fabricated by any
      desired production methods. In the case of bodies 10 which have a
      cross section of differing length and/or are disposed
      asymmetrically on the guide element 1 and/or are fashioned to be
      different sizes, it is particularly advantageous that the saline
      solution advantageously mixes on flowing down. This further
      improves the absorption/adsorption of the atmospheric water. <br>
      <br>
      [0130] Advantageously, the guide element 1 comprises a mixing
      structure for mixing the absorbent/adsorbent at least during the
      absorption/adsorption phase or on the absorption/adsorption
      section. If appropriate, the mixing structure is fashioned in the
      abovementioned manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0131] In principle, it can be advantageous that, in the direction
      of the wind flow, different, or different numbers per unit ground
      area of guide elements 1 and/or blocks A, B, C, D are disposed
      and/or different brine streams or different numbers of brine drops
      per unit time and/or different brine concentrations are provided.
      By this means, an advantageous adaptation e.g. to the changing
      wind strength and/or amounts of water present in the air can be
      implemented. For example, in the case of the guide element 1
      facing the wind, comparatively many brine drops per unit time can
      be provided, and in the case of the guide element 1 facing away
      from the wind, relatively few brine drops per unit time can be
      provided. This means, e.g., at the front relatively much brine
      flows, and at the rear relatively little brine flows down per unit
      time on the guide elements 1 or bodies 10. <br>
      <br>
      [0132] Preferably, on the wind-facing side of the inventive device
      or the vanes 28, a lower density of the guide elements 1 is
      provided than on the side of the inventive device or the vanes
      facing away from the wind. By this means, firstly adaptation per
      se to air moistures changing due to the water extraction can be
      implemented. Secondly, the relatively closely-disposed guide
      elements 1 on the side facing away from the wind can if
      appropriate collect brine drops which have drifted off. <br>
      <br>
      [0133] Advantageously, on the side of the inventive device or of
      the vanes 28 facing away from the wind, a collecting device for
      drifted-off brine is provided. This increases the efficiency of
      the inventive device and also decreases an impairment of the
      environment owing to brine which is blown off. Possibly, the
      collecting device is implemented in the abovementioned manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0134] In the FIGS. 11 to 13, different variants of adjustable or
      changeable vanes 28 for the inventive device for different wind
      strengths a, b, c, (storm or strong wind: a; medium wind: b; weak
      wind or calm: c) are illustrated diagrammatically. In this case
      the vanes are advantageously adaptable not only to the wind
      direction but also to the wind strength. In the case of strong
      wind, the cross sectional area of the vanes 28 through which wind
      can flow is relatively small and in a weak wind relatively large.
      On the other hand, the vanes 28 can be orientated into the wind
      direction by rotating and/or rotating the column 29. By means of
      these measures, the vanes 28 are protected, in particular from
      damage by the wind. <br>
      <br>
      [0135] The variant according to FIG. 11 has vanes 28 which are
      fixed on the column 29 so as to be able to rotate by means of a
      joint or hinge. The column 29 is preferably mounted so as to be
      able to rotate. <br>
      <br>
      [0136] In the case of the variant according to FIG. 12, the vanes
      28 are fixed to the column 29 so as to be able to rotate by means
      of a joint or hinge and in addition have vane sections which are
      fixed to one another so as to be able to rotate by means of a
      joint or hinge. In this case, if appropriate, the ability to
      rotate of the column 29 can be dispensed with. <br>
      <br>
      [0137] According to the variant illustrated in FIG. 13, the vanes
      28 are formed from respectively moveable or adjustable vane
      sections. For example, these are vanes 28 in the manner of a
      sliding door or the like. The column 29 is in this variant
      preferably mounted so as to be able to rotate. In general, in
      certain applications, the vanes 28 can be conducted or supported
      on the ground. <br>
      <br>
      [0138] In principle, the entire inventive device and what is
      termed the "alpha-spring system" can be substantially optimally
      adapted to the local climatic and energy conditions by
      computer-controlled measurement and process control. For this, in
      particular sensors are provided at least for determining a
      temperature and/or a pressure and/or humidity and/or flow rate
      and/or the wind direction and/or wind strength and/or operation
      readiness of individual elements of the device etc. <br>
