      <p>MPK Co produces glow-in-the-dark paint. Safety is one of their
        first intended applications of the new continuously fluorescing
        Litrospheres™. </p>
      <p>GlowPaint glow-in-the-dark paint company, MPK Co., has come up
        with self-luminous micro particles called Litrospheres which
        they say are inexpensive, non-toxic, and will stay on for 12+
        years (half-life point) continuously -- without having to be
        plugged into any power source. The Litrospheres are not effected
        by heat or cold, and are 5,000-pound crush resistant. They can
        be injection molded or added to paint. The fill rate of
        Litroenergy micro particles in plastic injection molding
        material or paint is about 20%. The constant light gives off no
        UV rays, and can be designed to emit almost any color of light
        desired. The company seeks to mass produce this mateiral and
        supply OEMs. This has potential to save billions in energy costs
        world-wide. Litroenergy™ surpasses all known available lighting
        options for cost/durability/reliability and safety." --- Steve
        Stark, MPK Co. </p>
      <p>"The uses are unlimited as the imagination; however we predict
        the safety aspects to be the front runner in application (light
        safety tape, lighted life rafts/flotation equipment, light
        safety markings/equipment, etc.). Supplemental light source will
        be second as the material is bright and one can read by it, if
        you have some Litroenergy lighting you will not need to always
        turn on a light source that requires electricity. The use of
        Litroenergy in toys, sports/camping equipment, bikes and novelty
        uses will be close in applications." </p>

      </center>
      <center><b>by Sterling D. Allan</b> <br>
        <b><i>Pure Energy Systems</i></b></center>
      <p><b><i>By combining a non-stop luminescing technology that has a
            20-year duration (12-year half-life), with thin film
            photovoltaics in a layered arrangement, MPK Co. has devised
            a portable, continuous generator that could change the
            planet.</i></b> </p>
      <p>Imagine a laptop or cell phone battery that never has to be
        recharged. Imagine an electric vehicle that can drive non-stop
        with no need to recharge. Imagine a generator in your garage
        that requires no fuel, essentially no maintenance, and provides
        enough power for all your electrical needs. </p>
      <p>Such a day may not be far away with the advent of a marriage of
        two energy technologies. Simply join solar thin film technology
        that turns photons into electrons together with the luminescent
        microspheres by MPK Co. to produces continuous photons, and you
        have continuous electricity generation. </p>
      <p>Well…, not exactly “continuous”, because the LitroSphere™
        photon output rate very gradually diminishes over time, but
        we’re talking over many years, like 20, rather than hours. But
        unlike batteries, there is no “off” switch for these
        betavoltatic devices. They just generate electricity at a fixed
        rate, and they keep on going, and going, and going, and going –
        without any waste byproduct. </p>
      <p>The cell-phone battery and electric vehicle capability may be a
        ways off yet, but some of the portable applications that can
        handle a little more size and weight will be available first. </p>
      <p>You’ve heard of thin film solar. Konarka, a leader in that
        industry, for example, just announced this week that they are
        now in mass production of their low-cost, printed rolls of solar
        sheets at a rate of 1 gigawatt of simultaneous output capacity
        per year – the same capacity as one nuclear power plant, and at
        a price that is in the same ballpark. </p>
      <p>What about MPK? Perhaps not yet a household word, but they
        certainly are not unknowns. Last year their luminescent
        microspheres technology won first place in NASA’s “Future
        Design” contest. The microspheres can be embedded in transparent
        paint to create essentially a permanent-lighting paint. MPK has
        subsequently developed Litroenergy sheets that create on-going
        light. Their light emitting micro particles and/or sheets are
        not affected by heat or cold and will produce
        consistent/constant light while also being extremely durable. </p>
      <p>Now, with this concept of joining their Litroenergy sheets with
        solar thin film sheets, MPK may win the NASA contest again this
        year. Posting this idea for the first time last Friday (the
        contest deadline) on the NASA contest website, they have already
        risen in the top tier among 766 contestants this year. </p>
      <p>The combining these two technologies – the thin-film solar and
        the LitroSpheres™ – would entail very thin, repeated layers of
        each so that a large number of stacked sets would comprise a
        significant power density. They call these versatile hybrid
        species, Litroenergy Power Cells, which can be scaled from micro
        applications to large utilities. </p>
      <p>How long will the wait be until we see this on the market?
        According to Steve Stark, Director of Marketing for MPK, product
        could be rolling out of manufacturing plants in as little as
        three months from now, depending on financing. The technology
        and players are already in place, and the independent testing of
        this combination will be completed in a few weeks. The results
        from MPK’s in-house testing have been very encouraging. “There
        is a lot going on behind the scenes that I can not disclose at
        this time, but it is huge” said Stark. </p>
      <p>MPK has been able to gain the cooperation of both major
        government and corporate interests, which they are not yet ready
        to disclose publicly, but which speaks highly of their
        persistence and accomplishment. (Steve filled me in on some of
        the details.)&nbsp; It is "definitely worth doing", said one of
        the government experts who has actually tested another version
        of the concept. </p>
      <p>The match of the wavelength of the LitroSphere™ luminescence,
        and the solar cell collection is close to optimal – something
        that could be improved in future versions, but which is already
        more than adequate for efficient pairing. </p>
      <p>The Litroenergy technology is based on a combination of an
        advanced phosphorus and tritium, hence the 12-year half-life.
        Tritium is the most harmless of the various radioactive
        elements, and is ubiquitous in nature, in the air we breathe and
        the water we drink. Tritium is quite benign. Only in recent
        years has it no longer been considered perfectly safe. The MPK
        packaging of tritium into microspheres that have a 5,000-pound
        crush resistance, makes this technology safe. In the case of
        release into the air, it essentially is released as hydrogen.
        The minute, "soft" radioactive emissions from the tritium do not
        penetrate through the walls of the microsphere encapsulation.
        MPK is having the Litroenergy Power Cells tested for
        classification as non-toxic and non-radioactive. </p>
      <p>Taking the gradual diminishment over time, the power output
        will need to be engineered in such a way that it is overbuilt
        for the devices it is powering so that it matches the desired
        lifespan of the device.&nbsp; In many applications, an
        accompanying battery may be designed into the system to serve as
        a reservoir of the continuous trickle charge output of the
        Litroenergy Power Cell, while the device may only be used
        transiently. How the excess energy is dispersed during the first
        portion of the device lifetime can be engineered appropriately.

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> This invention relates to a means for more
        efficiently and more safely providing self-luminous lighting
        devices for use in signs, markers, indicators and the like. The
        present invention provides self luminosity by means of a
        plurality of glass or polymer microspheres containing both a
        light-emitting phosphor and a radioactive gas. The "soft"
        emission of electrons from the beta emitting gas cannot
        penetrate the glass or polymer wall of the microspheres, thereby
        constituting no radiation hazard. A further advantage of the
        present invention is that the plurality of individual
        containment microspheres minimizes the escape of radioactive gas
        in the event of any physical damage to an assembly of such
        microspheres. A still further advantage of the invention is that
        the radioactive gas completely surrounds the phosphor particles,
        thus causing light emission from one hundred percent of the
        surface of the particles. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0004]1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0005]The present invention relates to a long life illumination
        source and, more particularly, to a self-contained, long life
        illumination source and, most particularly, to long life,
        self-luminous microspheres for such use. </p>
      <p><b>[0006]2. Background Information</b> </p>
      <p>[0007]Self-luminous signs and indicators have been in use since
        early in the twentieth century and have experienced numerous
        improvements over the intervening years. The early uses of
        self-luminosity employed radium as the activator for a phosphor;
        however, radium constituted a health hazard from its "hard"
        radiation and was abandoned. In more recent times a number of
        radio isotopes have been developed and produced, which serve to
        activate phosphors to luminescence. Depending upon the choice of
        isotope, one may obtain alpha, beta or gamma radiation and it
        has been found that alpha and gamma radiation are hazardous to
        health, leaving the beta radiators as the safe type for
        self-luminescence devices. By definition, the beta radiators
        emit electrons which are relatively heavy particles and exhibit
        less velocity. This type of radiation will not penetrate a thin
        glass wall, such as is employed in the present invention.
        However, beta radiation is effective in causing phosphors to
        luminesce. Among the beta radiating isotopes, we have selected
        tritium as the activator for the present device. Tritium
        exhibits a half-life of 12.5 years, which is quite adequate for
        the purpose intended. Other isotopes might be used; however,
        some have small amounts of "hard" radiation and exhibit
        differing half-lives, such as: </p>
      <p>[0008]Promethium.sup.147, having a half-life of 2.7 years,
        Thallium.sup.204, having a half-life of 3.6 years and
        Krypton.sup.85, having a half-life of 10.0 years. However,
        Krypton.sup.85 yields approximately 0.5% of its radiation in the
        form of gamma rays, which are hazardous to living organisms. </p>
      <p>[0009]Others have made various forms of self-luminous devices;
        however, these have suffered from lack of efficiency for any of
        the following causes: </p>
      <p>[0010](a) Light being obstructed by the phosphor and the
        radioactive substance being chemically combined to become a
        solid. </p>
      <p>[0011](b) Light being obstructed or attenuated by having to
        pass through a layer of phosphor to become visible. </p>
      <p>[0012](c) Light being limited by only one side of the phosphor
        particles being exposed to the radiation. </p>
      <p>[0013]A further problem with some of the previous devices has
        been that the phosphor was combined with a binder to allow a
        film coating on the inside of a glass envelope which contained
        the radioactive gas. In this instance, not only did the film
        attenuate the light, but the binder deteriorated with time due
        to its exposure to the radiation. </p>
      <p>[0014]Some individuals have made self-luminous paints, wherein
        the radioactive gas was converted to a solid by chemical
        combination with a transparent polymer, which was then deposited
        on phosphor crystals. In this instance, exposure to its own
        radiation resulted in the tritiated polymer losing gas and the
        tritiated gas compounds readily diffuse through the polymer,
        thus resulting in a radiation hazard, as well as to degrade the
        transparency of the polymer. </p>
      <p>[0015]Work in the area of self-luminous signs has been done by
        such companies as American Atomics, Inc., Self Powered Lighting,
        Inc. and by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL). See U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,383,382 of Self Powered Lighting, Inc. In addition,
        the 3M company has done considerable work with self-lumination;
        however, their means involve the hazard and light attenuation
        problems described above. </p>
      <p>[0016]NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has done work with the
        confinement of atomic waste materials in glass envelopes and in
        a manner similar to that described herein. However, NASA's Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory employed a standard method of forming
        glass spheres, and they were not concerned with
        self-luminescence. No phosphors were involved with their work. </p>
      <p>[0017]A recent invention, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,008
        by Webb, provides a safe and efficient self-luminous
        microspheres and a process for making the same. The
        self-luminous microspheres disclosed are of limited utility
        because the phosphor particles were inefficient at producing
        illumination from the tritium radiation and are subject to
        degradation, particularly on exposure to ultraviolet light. The
        ultraviolet light degradation of the phosphor particles,
        disclosed by Webb, prevents applications in which the
        self-luminous microspheres are located outdoors. </p>
      <p>[0018]Applicant has devised an improved and more efficient
        self-luminous microspheres that overcome many of the
        shortcomings of those disclosed in the above-mentioned patents.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0019]The invention obviates the problems described in the
        foregoing approaches to self-luminosity by confining the
        radioactive material within a glass walled sphere, along with
        the light-emitting phosphor in such manner that the emitted
        light does not have to pass through any light attenuating
        medium. </p>
      <p>[0020]Though numerous radioactive gases might be employed,
        tritium gas was chosen as the activator for the light-emitting
        phosphor. Tritium is a "soft" beta emitter, and the radiation
        does not penetrate the glass wall of the envelope. The clear
        borosilicate glass microsphere offers no appreciable attenuation
        of the emitted light. </p>
      <p>[0021]The formation of glass microspheres is a well-known art
        and is widely used in providing strong, light-weight fillers for
        epoxies and the like. Also well known is the art of filling such
        microspheres with a gas, since the gas pressure is fundamental
        to the formation of the hollow spheres. </p>
      <p>[0022]The present invention employs light-emitting phosphor
        particles that embody high efficiency in converting tritium
        radiation into visible light. The phosphor particles also are
        highly resistant to degradation by ultraviolet light, thus
        enabling applications where the microspheres are exposed to
        sunlight. </p>
      <p>[0023]The phosphor particles, according to the preferred
        embodiment of the invention, have the general formula:
        MO.(n-x){aAl.sub.2O.sub.3.sup..alpha.+(1-a)Al.sub.2O.sub.3.sup..gamma.}.x-
B.sub.2O.sub.3:






        R, where M is any alkaline earth metal preferably selected from
        among Sr, Ca and Ba, and R is a rare earth element selected from
        La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Mn and Bi.
        Most preferably, the phosphor particles of the present invention
        contain strontium aluminate borate. </p>

      <p><b>Construction</b> </p>
      <p>[0063]In the present invention, the standard method of forming
        gas filled microspheres is modified to employ tritium gas and to
        employ the pressure of the gas to insert the light-emitting
        phosphor particles into each microsphere. The process for this
        insertion is best illustrated by referring to FIG. 1, where a
        crucible 1 containing molten glass or polymer 2 is necked down
        to form a funnel 10 at its bottom. Concentric within the funnel
        10, and of a smaller diameter, is a capillary tube 6 extending
        upward from the plane of the end of the funnel 10 to a chamber
        14. A gas inlet 3 conducts a gas at a suitable pressure (P1) to
        regulate the flow of molten glass or polymer through the annular
        area 8 between the funnel 10 and the capillary tube 6. The
        tritium gas 4 is fed under pressure (P2) to a venturi section
        13, where a first tube 11 feeds a relatively high pressure to a
        chamber 5 containing particles of phosphor 9. </p>
      <p>[0064]A second tube 12 is located beyond the venturi section 13
        at a relatively low pressure area and extends downward into the
        upper portion of chamber 5 which contains the stock of phosphor
        particles 9. The pressure differential between the two tubes 11
        and 12 results in a relative vacuum in the chamber 14, causing
        the phosphor particles 9 to rise into the chamber 14 where the
        flow of the tritium gas 4 sweeps them into the capillary tube 6,
        forming a mixture of phosphor particles and tritium gas 15,
        which forms the filler for the gas microspheres being formed at
        8. The completed, filled microsphere 4, 2, 9 are shown as they
        separate from the annular area at the bottom of the equipment.
        FIG. 1 is schematic only and does not represent the actual
        proportions of the components of the system. The pressure of the
        tritium gas 4 may be pulsed to aid in forming the microspheres.
        The microsphere 2 must be fabricated from a material transparent
        to visible light, such as glass or polymer, in order for the
        light emitted by the phosphor particles 9 to traverse the gas
        tight microsphere envelope 2 containing the tritium gas 4 and
        phosphor particles 9. </p>
      <p>[0065]The phosphor particles 9, according to the preferred
        embodiment of the invention, have the general formula:
        MO.(n-x){aAl.sub.2O.sub.3.sup..alpha.+(1-a)Al.sub.2O.sub.3.sup..gamma.}.x-
B.sub.2O.sub.3:






        R, where M is any alkaline earth metal preferably selected from
        among Sr, Ca and Ba, and R is a rare earth element selected from
        La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Mn and Bi.
        These phosphor particles are available from Qinglong Hao, 45
        Yili, Zhujiafedn, Fengtai District, Beijing 100074, China. The
        preparation of this class of phosphor particles 9 is disclosed
        in U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,488, and the contents of this reference
        is incorporated herein. Most preferably, the phosphor particles
        9 of the present invention contain strontium aluminate borate. </p>
      <p>[0066]Referring to FIG. 2, it will be noted that the
        radioactive gas 4 surrounds the phosphor particles 9 within the
        glass or polymer envelope 2, thus exposing the light-emitting
        phosphor 9 to radiation 16 from all sides, thus increasing the
        efficiency of light generation. FIG. 2 shows the phosphor
        particles 9 in a somewhat ideal dispersal. However, even when
        more closely packed, the 100% exposure of the phosphor particles
        9 to the radiation 16 remains valid. </p>
      <p>[0067]Referring now to FIG.3, an alternative microsphere
        production system 100, used in the process of forming the gas
        filled microspheres 101 of the present invention, is
        illustrated. The production system 100 includes tritium gas 104
        confined within a container 102, having an outlet valve 106
        connected to a transfer conduit 108 for routing the tritium gas
        104 to a capillary tube 110, that passes through a heated
        container 120. The outlet valve 106 serves to regulate the flow
        of phosphor particles 109 through the capillary tube 110. The
        transfer conduit 108 includes an inlet line 112 supplied with
        phosphor particles 109 from a reservoir container 114. As the
        phosphor particles 109 enter the transfer conduit 108, the
        tritium gas 104 carries phosphor particles 109 through the
        transfer conduit 108 and into the capillary tube 110. </p>
      <p>[0068]A reservoir of molten glass or polymer 122 is maintained
        within the heated container 120. The heated container 120
        includes an outlet nozzle section 124, illustrated in detail in
        FIG. 4. The outlet nozzle section 124 includes a central bore
        126, with the capillary tube 110 concentrically positioned
        within the central bore 126. The outlet end 111 of the capillary
        tube 110 is positioned at the bottom end 128 of the central bore
        126 of the outlet nozzle section 124. As small bubbles of the
        mixture of tritium gas 104 and phosphor particles 109 emerge
        from the outlet end 111 of the capillary tube 110, the molten
        glass or polymer 122 forms a gas tight envelope or microsphere
        101 to encapsulate the mixture. The resulting microspheres 101
        fall through a cooling gas atmosphere 130 contained within a
        collection container 132 and collect at the bottom of the
        collection container 132. Any microspheres 101 that do not seal
        properly results in tritium gas 104 contaminating the cooling
        gas atmosphere 130 within the collection chamber 132. The
        resulting cooling gas atmosphere 130 is routed through an outlet
        conduit 134 and through several tritium recycle containers 140,
        where the tritium 104 is collected for recycling to the head of
        the microsphere production system 100. Preferably, the polymer
        122 selected for the gas tight envelope or microsphere 101 is
        resistant to degradation by beta radiation from the tritium gas
        104 contained therein. </p>
      <p>[0069]A plurality of the microspheres 101 of FIG. 2 may be
        disposed on a surface to form signs, markers, indicators and the
        like, useful for outdoor applications. A plurality of the
        microspheres 101 of FIG. 2 may be disposed in a transparent
        binder to form a luminous paint, also useful for outdoor
        applications. As mentioned above, the phosphor particles 9 or
        109 of the present invention are highly resistant to degradation
        by ultraviolet light, thus enabling applications where the
        microspheres 101 are exposed to sunlight. </p>
      <p>[0070]The microspheres 101 of the present invention provide
        many advantages in comparison to prior known self-luminous
        devices. The continuous excitation of the phosphor particles 9
        or 109 by the radioactive decay of tritium gas 4 or 104 provides
        visible light continuously for the life of the microsphere 101.
        The extended production of usable light, without the need for
        additional energy to recharge the phosphor particles 9 or 109,
        results in an extremely, economical light source. The
        exceptional stability of the phosphor particles 9 or 109 to
        ultraviolet light degradation allows continuous usage of the
        microspheres 101 in any location, indoors or out, as well as
        under water. </p>
      <p>[0071]Additionally, the exceptional features of the
        microspheres 101 of the present invention allow a device
        containing the microspheres 101 to replace conventional lighting
        devices requiring a source of electrical energy. Consequently,
        with wide spread usage of the present invention, electrical
        power usage can be greatly reduced. This, in turn, results in
        decreased green house emissions from power plant combustion of
        fossil fuels, thereby assisting in combating global warming. </p>
      <p>[0072]While the invention has been particularly shown and
        described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it
        will be understood by those skilled in the art that various
        changes in form and details may be made therein without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </p>

      <p><b><i>By combining a non-stop luminescing technology that has a
            20-year duration (12-year half-life), with thin film
            photovoltaics in a layered arrangement, MPK Co. has devised
            a portable, continuous generator that could change the
            planet.</i></b> </p>
      <p>Imagine a laptop or cell phone battery that never has to be
        recharged. Imagine an electric vehicle that can drive non-stop
        with no need to recharge. Imagine a generator in your garage
        that requires no fuel, essentially no maintenance, and provides
        enough power for all your electrical needs. </p>
      <p>Such a day may not be far away with the advent of a marriage of
        two energy technologies. Simply join solar thin film technology
        that turns photons into electrons together with the luminescent
        microspheres by MPK Co. to produces continuous photons, and you
        have continuous electricity generation. </p>
      <p>Well…, not exactly “continuous”, because the LitroSphere™
        photon output rate very gradually diminishes over time, but
        we’re talking over many years, like 20, rather than hours. But
        unlike batteries, there is no “off” switch for these
        betavoltatic devices. They just generate electricity at a fixed
        rate, and they keep on going, and going, and going, and going –
        without any waste byproduct. </p>
      <p>The cell-phone battery and electric vehicle capability may be a
        ways off yet, but some of the portable applications that can
        handle a little more size and weight will be available first. </p>
      <p>You’ve heard of thin film solar. Konarka, a leader in that
        industry, for example, just announced this week that they are
        now in mass production of their low-cost, printed rolls of solar
        sheets at a rate of 1 gigawatt of simultaneous output capacity
        per year – the same capacity as one nuclear power plant, and at
        a price that is in the same ballpark. </p>
      <p>What about MPK? Perhaps not yet a household word, but they
        certainly are not unknowns. Last year their luminescent
        microspheres technology won first place in NASA’s “Future
        Design” contest. The microspheres can be embedded in transparent
        paint to create essentially a permanent-lighting paint. MPK has
        subsequently developed Litroenergy sheets that create on-going
        light. Their light emitting micro particles and/or sheets are
        not affected by heat or cold and will produce
        consistent/constant light while also being extremely durable. </p>
      <p>Now, with this concept of joining their Litroenergy sheets with
        solar thin film sheets, MPK may win the NASA contest again this
        year. Posting this idea for the first time last Friday (the
        contest deadline) on the NASA contest website, they have already
        risen in the top tier among 766 contestants this year. </p>
      <p>The combining these two technologies – the thin-film solar and
        the LitroSpheres™ – would entail very thin, repeated layers of
        each so that a large number of stacked sets would comprise a
        significant power density. They call these versatile hybrid
        species, Litroenergy Power Cells, which can be scaled from micro
        applications to large utilities. </p>
      <p>How long will the wait be until we see this on the market?
        According to Steve Stark, Director of Marketing for MPK, product
        could be rolling out of manufacturing plants in as little as
        three months from now, depending on financing. The technology
        and players are already in place, and the independent testing of
        this combination will be completed in a few weeks. The results
        from MPK’s in-house testing have been very encouraging. “There
        is a lot going on behind the scenes that I can not disclose at
        this time, but it is huge” said Stark. </p>
      <p>MPK has been able to gain the cooperation of both major
        government and corporate interests, which they are not yet ready
        to disclose publicly, but which speaks highly of their
        persistence and accomplishment. (Steve filled me in on some of
        the details.)&nbsp; It is "definitely worth doing", said one of
        the government experts who has actually tested another version
        of the concept. </p>
      <p>The match of the wavelength of the LitroSphere™ luminescence,
        and the solar cell collection is close to optimal – something
        that could be improved in future versions, but which is already
        more than adequate for efficient pairing. </p>
      <p>The Litroenergy technology is based on a combination of an
        advanced phosphorus and tritium, hence the 12-year half-life.
        Tritium is the most harmless of the various radioactive
        elements, and is ubiquitous in nature, in the air we breathe and
        the water we drink. Tritium is quite benign. Only in recent
        years has it no longer been considered perfectly safe. The MPK
        packaging of tritium into microspheres that have a 5,000-pound
        crush resistance, makes this technology safe. In the case of
        release into the air, it essentially is released as hydrogen.
        The minute, "soft" radioactive emissions from the tritium do not
        penetrate through the walls of the microsphere encapsulation.
        MPK is having the Litroenergy Power Cells tested for
        classification as non-toxic and non-radioactive. </p>
      <p>Taking the gradual diminishment over time, the power output
        will need to be engineered in such a way that it is overbuilt
        for the devices it is powering so that it matches the desired
        lifespan of the device.&nbsp; In many applications, an
        accompanying battery may be designed into the system to serve as
        a reservoir of the continuous trickle charge output of the
        Litroenergy Power Cell, while the device may only be used
        transiently. How the excess energy is dispersed during the first
        portion of the device lifetime can be engineered appropriately.
