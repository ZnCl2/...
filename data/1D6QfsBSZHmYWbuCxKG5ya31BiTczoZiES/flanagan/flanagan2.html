      <br>
      Last time around, two issues ago, I reported on the process made
      by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) concerning
      computer recognition of human EEG patterns.&nbsp; I stated that
      this was a major breakthrough in the development of the true
      intelligence amplifier wherein the human nervous system was linked
      directly with the electronic circuitry of a large general purpose
      computer.&nbsp; Soon, the crystalline circuitry of the computer
      will be able to "understand" the colloidal circuitry of the human
      nervous system by direct linkage through electromagnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      And I left you hanging by your fingernails on a figurative cliff
      overhanging an ammonia sea swarming with methane monsters, so to
      speak.<br>
      <br>
      I stated that seventeen years ago the breakthrough had been made
      that would permit the colloidal circuitry of the nervous system to
      "understand" the crystalline circuitry of the electronic computer.
      In other words, if the computer signal was in the proper form, the
      human nervous system could pick up and decipher the electronic
      computer signal through an electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      In early 1962, I was working as assistant director of research for
      the Huyck Corporation in Milford, Connecticut.&nbsp; Dr. William
      O. Davis was the director of research, and he had been charged by
      the company to look for new products to insure that Huyck would be
      in business twenty five years hence. There were no caveats placed
      on us at that time.&nbsp; We could look at or for anything....and
      we did.&nbsp; Then as now I have all sorts of pipelines into the
      back rooms of various research and development organizations here
      and abroad; a science fact or science fiction writer really cant
      function properly without these contacts.&nbsp; My most valuable
      Little Black Spy was the former editor of this magazine.&nbsp;
      John W. Campbell, who in turn had an incredible network of Little
      Black Spies.<br>
      <br>
      Campbell told me of an 18 year old boy in Texas who had invented a
      spectacular new hearing aid.&nbsp; I made a telephone call, talked
      to the boy, and was on a plane to Houston within days.<br>
      <br>
      G. Patrick Flanagan of Ballaire Texas was a boy genius. In
      addition to being an outstanding gymnast and a pilot, this high
      school graduate had stumbled upon a technique of introducing audio
      information directly into the human nervous system without
      loudspeakers or earphones, and without direct electrical
      connection between his gadget and the nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      On July 24, 1962 in Bellaire, Texas in Flanagan's shop in the
      attic of his parents home, I personally witnessed
      proof-of-principle demonstration of a direct linkage between a
      crystalline electronic circuit and the colloidal system of the
      human nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      The device called the "neurophone" by Flanagan, was a very simple
      gadget. It used those ancient devices known as vacuum tubes.&nbsp;
      It used a 6L6G tube running as a 35 Kilohertz oscillator; the
      output of the oscillator was amplitude-modulated by the output of
      ant single channel hi-fi system through suitable impedance
      matching transformers, etc. This amplitude modulated 35 kilohertz
      signal then went through a cheapie stepup transformer so that the
      output was very high voltage (about 4 kilovolts, as I remember)
      but at very high impedance.&nbsp; Flanagan fed this signal through
      a length of ordinary TV antenna twin lead to a pair of rubber pads
      about six inches in diameter that he had filched from a
      "relaxicisor" muscle relaxing device.&nbsp; Each pad consisted of
      a 1/16 inch thick rubber sheet, a piece of copper window screen to
      which was soldered one of the wires of the twin lead, and the
      rubber covering of the relaxicisor pad.&nbsp; The rubber
      insulation kept one from getting zapped, although the shock wasn't
      painful....just annoying.<br>
      <br>
      Put a signal into the neurophone input, peak the frequency, peak
      the modulation to 100%, and then hold the two pads to your
      body....anywhere. And you heard music playing in your head!
      Although the pads worked better and you got a louder signal with
      the pads on your bare skin, it would work through a layer of
      clothing. And it worked regardless of where you put the two pads!
      You could put one on your shoulder and the other on the sole of
      your foot...and you would<br>
      still hear whatever program material was being played into the
      neurophone form the hi-fi system.<br>
      <br>
      I can freely describe this today because (a) I dont think
      Flanagan's patent application ever got accepted and I don't
      believe the patent ever issued. (b) Huyck Corporation is off doing
      its classic thing of making paper machine parts and isn't
      interested in the slightest, and (c) I think the time is just
      about right to get going on this little gadget again.<br>
      <br>
      Flanagan had succeeded where others had failed. Dr Henry Puharich
      had succeeded in developing a similar device, but the pads were
      one inch copper plates that had to be rubbed along the skin to
      achieve the "fricative effect" to permit Puharich's gadget to
      work.<br>
      <br>
      In a series of long and complex experiments conducted under my
      supervision at Huyck and by Dr Wayne Batteau at Tuffs, it was
      conclusively shown that the neurophone effect not the result of
      (a) the pads acting as electrostatic loudspeakers, (b) the pads
      exciting bone conduction of the sound, or (c) the pads activating
      the eighth cranial nerve. Although I tried the neurophone an a
      nerve deaf medical doctor at Columbia University in 1965, I kept
      the experiment running for only about ten minutes.&nbsp; Dr Wayne
      Batteau tried it at Tufts and succeed because the brain of his
      nerve deaf subject had "forgotten how to hear" and needed
      something over an hour of application of the neurophone signal in
      order to begin to hear in his brain again!&nbsp; We know now that
      the Flanagan neurophone operated by direct linkage of the
      electronic circuitry with the nervous system through
      electromagnetic fields. We know now that the nervous system will
      pick up any signal and send it to the brain where the brain
      recognizes the signal according to the sensory data it represents,
      then switches the signal to the proper sector of the brain
      responsible for processing such signals.&nbsp; But we don't know
      how Flanagan accidentally happened to crack the neural code for
      audio data.<br>
      <br>
      I can assure you that the Flanagan neurophone is no hoax. Many
      responsible people experienced it. Just before his death, Dr
      William O. Davis gave me one of the neurophones we had built at
      Huyck; I still have it, but a two hour search through my
      uncatalogued archives of scientific memorabilia and trivia failed
      to locate it this morning. Im going to dig it out and try it again
      for fun. And because it does represent a breakthrough that will
      permit electronic computers to communicate directly to our nervous
      systems...by putting on a beanie, and not plugging a cable into a
      socket implanted on the top of our heads!<br>
      <br>
      The DARPA work with computers deciphering human EEG signals, plus
      the Flanagan neurophone capable of permitting a computer to
      communicate directly with a human, both make inevitable the final
      computer; the use of the computer as a extension to the human
      brain as an intelligence amplifier for the human being.<br>
      <br>
      Now, what happened with the Flanagan neurophone, and why havent
      you heard more about it? I am not sure that it is because of the
      reaction of Big Science as discussed by Jerry Pournelle last
      month.&nbsp; There were several factors involved.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, it didn't look like Huyck could get a patent
      position, so they wanted out. They also discovered that the Huyck
      Corporate Research Laboratories were producing more inventions,
      patents, and potential new products than the company could
      possibly absorb.&nbsp; Huyck also got into production trouble with
      several products that have come along before Corporate Research
      entered the picture.&nbsp; So Huyck dropped the entire corporate
      research program, writing off about 2.5 million spent over a five
      year period. They also convinced themselves that they could not
      afford to develop the marketing know-how for any of the new
      products we were coming up with. They succumbed, as have so many
      other small companies, to the "Harvard Business School Syndrome":
      Dont develop new technology and products yourself, but wait until
      somebody else does and then buy the whole schmear, product,
      production, and marketing know-how in a big package. My employment
      agreement was written in a way that I wasnt sure what I could talk
      about....then.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Wayne Batteau suffered a fatal heart attack in Hawaii while
      diving with dolphins. He had also done considerable work in that
      area.<br>
      <br>
      I dont know where Flanagan is. He worked for NASA in Houston for a
      time in computer programming. The last I knew, he was somewhere in
      California as one of the top experts pyramidology.&nbsp; I suspect
      I will hear from him as a result of this, and Ill welcome it.<br>
      <br>
      Big Science did not kill the neurophone. It was complacent, and it
      really didnt know anything about the device. Academia was not
      really consulted.&nbsp; The neurophone has been dormant for
      fourteen years now because of the failure of nerve and imagination
      in the sales and marketing department.<br>
      <br>
      But, now, there appears to be a need for the neurophone to take
      the final step toward direct communication between ourselves and
      our crystalline symbiotes/servants, the electronic computers.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, I am still interested in this area. I am interested in
      anything and everything. But do not-repeat, repeat do not write to
      me or telephone me and ask for free information.&nbsp; I am a
      writer and a consultant, and my business is information...and the
      only thing of real value that you or I have in this world is time.
      I didnt write this soliciting business; I wrote it to report to
      you that the intelligence amplifier is just around the corner and
      awaiting you bright people out there to put it together right so
      that humans stay in control of intelligence amplifiers.<br>
      <br>
      Now, what can we do in the future to integrate the creative
      process of "invention" more fully into the process of research,
      development, production, and marketing?&nbsp; Hang in there.....<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>When Jerry Pournelli and I started to write these columns as a
      vis a vis experiment, we hoped that sooner or later one of us
      would write something that the other could tee off on and thus get
      a good controversy going that would present "alternate
      views."&nbsp; It hasent worked out that way because Jerry and I
      have discovered that we think very much alike on most
      matters.&nbsp; We have not been able to stir up controversy
      between one another.&nbsp; But we did stir up controversy among
      the readers.<br>
      <br>
      When I wrote the columns on biocybernetics in the May and July
      1979 issues, my objective was more or less than science reporting
      with some synthesis included.&nbsp; I wanted to point out that a
      true interface between human brains and electronic computers was
      not only possible but that the basic experiments have been done
      and the foundation technologies already existed, albeit in the
      case of the Flanagan neurophone the data had been generally
      unknown for 16 years.&nbsp; I reported on the basis of what I knew
      at that time.&nbsp; I requested that no one write for additional
      data because I didnt have any additional data at that time.&nbsp;
      I do now.<br>
      <br>
      These two columns have resulted in an inordinate amount of mail
      from readers which makes the editor happy because he knows people
      are reading this. Some of the letters were anticipated, some were
      not.&nbsp; Some were from people who were deaf and wanted the
      Flanagan neurophone at any price.&nbsp; Others wanted the
      neurophone to use in attempts to contact loved family members in a
      coma. There were the usual letters from Ph.Ds who should know
      better than to make some of the statements they did.&nbsp; And I
      got letters with real up to date information.<br>
      <br>
      I discovered that Dr G. Patrick Flanagan is alive and well and
      living 125 miles from me!<br>
      <br>
      That's an hour's flight in my Cherokee, so I went to see Pat on
      July 26, 1979. We spent the day together on his 15 acre ranch in
      his office and laboratory. I now have enough material for a number
      articles once I study and digest it all.<br>
      <br>
      For the benefit of those who are interested, you may reach Dr G.
      Patrick Flanagan at P.O. Box 18224, Tucson, Az 85731. Or telephone
      him at (602)749-4012 no collect calls, please.&nbsp; You may
      obtain copies of his two neurophone patents by writing to the U.S.
      Patent Office and ordering Patent No. 3,393,279 granted July 16,
      1968 and Patent No. 3,647,970 granted March 7,<br>
      1972.<br>
      <br>
      The rights to Patent No. 3,393,279 are owned by Intelectron, Inc.
      of New York City.&nbsp; The FDA will not permit it to be marketed
      because it uses a low frequency r-f carrier, and they are very
      sensitive these days about the biological effects of r-f
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      But Pat Flanagan is an inventor.&nbsp; With his original patent
      rights in the hands of another company and with an FDA ban on its
      production, Flanagan developed the second neurophone device
      covered by Patent No. 3,647,970 which does not use an r-f carrier
      and does not involve high voltages. At the behest of the
      Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce placed
      Flanagan's new device under secrecy order No. 756,124 dated August
      28, 1968. Flanagan was able to get this secrecy order rescinded in
      1972 to permit the patent to be issued.<br>
      <br>
      I sat in Flanagan's study and listened to the new neurophone on
      July 26, 1979. It works even better than the original one. It
      operates from eightType AA alkaline penlight cells.&nbsp; The
      audio signal is double differentiated and converted to a 60 volt
      square wave which is then run through a zero crossing detector.
      The sensor electrodes are one inch diameter plates made from lead
      zirconium titanate insulated on one side with epoxy that also
      seals the attachment of the lead from the neurophone.<br>
      <br>
      With one electrode placed on the soft skin of my calf and the
      other on my chest, I heard the audio information from the tape
      recorder input in my head. I listened to both speech and music,
      and the fidelity was outstanding. I had a cassette tape recorder
      running two feet from me while this was going on; there is no
      evidence of the audio information recorded on the cassette by the
      recorder; I was the only entity hearing the neurophone, and it was
      therefore not producing and sound waves that the microphone of the
      recorder could pick up.<br>
      <br>
      As I knew 17 years ago, the Flanagan neurophone works. I don't
      give a doodly damn what all you bloody experts out there have
      presumptuously stated in your outraged fan letters to me.&nbsp; I
      am forced to repeat the immortal words of Dr. J. C. Warren voiced
      after performing the first surgery with a patient under ether
      anesthetic administrated by Dr. William Thomas Green Morton in
      Boston on October 16, 1846:<br>
      <br>
      "Gentlemen, this is no humbug!"<br>
      <br>
      For the benefit of all you who wrote me, I gave your letters to
      Flanagan. There is no need for me to be in the loop. There is no
      need for Flanagan to defend himself nor does he need help in doing
      so; he has a device that works. In the eyes of some sober,
      respected academicians, Flanagan is perhaps flamboyant and
      different, but that must not be allowed to detract from the fact
      that he is a successful inventor and, in common with many others
      of his unconventional and freewheeling nature in the history of
      science and technology, working on the fringes of scientific
      research in areas that others cant or wont touch.<br>
      <br>
      The most fascinating aspect of this whole affair has been the
      confirmation and terrible realization that the human race
      apparently has not progressed beyond the state of affairs a
      century ago when "legitimate" scientist dug in to defend their
      sacred turf....and made damned fools of themselves in the process.
      They also retarded the development of technology that would have
      relieved human suffering and generally improved the human
      condition. These scientific brahmins still exist; they are no
      different from the predecessors of a hundred years ago; and they
      exhibit an appalling lack of knowledge and understanding of the
      history of their own field of expertise!<br>
      <br>
      Arthur C. Clarke's law is still very much in force.<br>
      <br>
      Jerry Pournelle was 100% correct in his June 1979 "The Alternate
      View."<br>
      <br>
      I would like to extend my profound thanks and grateful
      appreciation to those scientific brahmins who wrote to me and to
      the editor about the neurophone and the human computer
      interface.&nbsp; You have greatly contributed to the contents of
      my "Utter Bilge" file. This is my collection of presumptuous
      statements from people who should know better than to make such
      statements in the first place. The file title derived from in
      infamous statement of Sir Richard Van Der Riet Wolley: "Space
      travel is utter bilge!"<br>
      <br>
      Scientific research and technical progress is not and has never
      has been the exclusive turf of any select group of people. There
      has always been a role for the amateur investigator, and still
      exists today.&nbsp; Before the "official" establishment of any new
      area of scientific endeavor, everyone who works in that area must,
      by definition, be an amateur. Even in the established fields of
      scientific endeavor, important discoveries have been made by
      amateur investigators. Good scientists and I have the pleasure of
      knowing many would never reject out of hand any amateur findings
      and will react with enthusiasm and interest to such findings. It
      is only poor scientists who are insecure that will react
      negatively. Would there were more good scientists!<br>
      <br>
      Bioelectronics today is about the same situation as electricity
      about a century ago. The field is ripe for experimentation.
      Certainly there is danger; there always is.&nbsp; But that is no
      reason for suppressing information, as one PhD. correspondent
      demanded be done, for fear of someone electrocuting himself by
      building a neurophone in his basement shop.&nbsp; People still get
      hurt in steam boiler explosions. As a matter of fact, people still
      get burned handling the ancient technology of a campfire. These
      accidents merely strengthen the statement of Herbert George Wells,
      "History is a race between education and catastrophe," but down on
      the personal level.<br>
      <br>
      To paraphrase Harold Laski, science by experts means, after a
      time, science in the interest of experts.....<br>

      Another device that uses the new hyperspatial, virtual state,

      is Dr. Pat Flanagan's neurophone.&nbsp; With brilliant insight and

      invented and patented the instrument by the time he was seventeen
      years old.&nbsp; The neurophone is a device that, contrary to all
      present theory and knowledge, will directly pump the brain and
      reproduce sound and information directly in the brain and mind
      system, without going through the auditory system at all. A
      simplified diagram of Pat's improved neurophone is shown in the
      figure.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly, the device takes a complex signal, such as the sound of
      an orchestra playing a musical interlude, and electrically
      processes it as shown in the figure.&nbsp; First the signal is
      passed into a section that clips everything into a series of
      square waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of clipped waves
      Lisitsyn confirms are the information carriers of the human
      brain.&nbsp; Next the square waves are differentiated, ielding a
      series of sharp spikes (note that these spikes retain the pulse
      time content of the clipped signal).&nbsp; These spikes are again
      differentiated, and since these are finite spikes with real
      nonzero rize times and decay times rather than theoretical
      constructs, a series of noisy spikes results from the second
      differentiator section. From here, the noisy spikes are introduced
      to special contact electrodes, one of which is normally placed on
      the forehead, while the other may be placed almost anywhere,
      including on the foot. Nowhere are any sound waves introduced to
      the head.<br>
      <br>
      The square wave clipper section reduces the complex signals, their
      overtones, and their complex modulations to square waves,
      retaining the temporal content of the wave mix but not the waves
      themselves.&nbsp; The first and second differentiators heighten or
      filter through the temporal content of the higher order
      differentiations, that is, they serve as a band pass filter unit
      to accent the time keying of the neutrinic and mind field portions
      or aspects of the signal.&nbsp; When these time spikes are then
      introduced across the body as pulsed voltages, they are modulated
      directly on the dendrite firings of the brain and nervous system,
      providing direct and pulsed modulation of the neutrnic and mind
      field component channels of the mind brain consciousness life loop
      itself.&nbsp; Thus the neurophone directly inputs information into
      the brain and nervous system, bypassing all the normal sensory
      systems that lie between the mind brain loop and outside
      environment.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      A series of experements were done by muscle testing pateints for
      meridian imbalances and then strengthening the muscle indicators,
      indicating balanced meridians, by running a time-domain amplifies
      signal through the patIent's skin.<br>
      <br>
      The skin is embryonically the source of all special senses. Our
      skin contains more sensors for heat, touch, pain, etc., than any
      other part of the human anatomy.&nbsp; The human ear evolves
      embryonically out of the convolutions of the skin of an embryo in
      the mothers uterus. Basically, the skin is the oldest evolutionary
      nervous system sensor. Another way to look at this, is the special
      sense of tough has progressively extended over the entire body by
      way of skin and evolutionary wise our other special senses should
      follow suit and extend over our entire body in time. The skin
      then, since it is the precursor of the ears, should also be
      capable of hearing, or to put it another way, it should be able to
      transmit the sense of hearing to the brain by means other than the
      8th Cranial Nerve.<br>
      <br>
      The skin is both piezo-electric and opto-electric, that is, when
      the skin is stimulated by an electric or photon field, it
      vibrates. If it is mechanically stimulated, it will generate its
      own electric and photon field. In Russia, blind people have been
      trained to "see" with their fingertips and in Czechoslovakia, deaf
      people have been trained to "hear" with their fingertips.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of our experiment, we used a Neurophone, a device
      developed by Dr Pat Flanagan, author of the book, PYRAMID POWER.
      The device uses hyperspacial nested modulation technology.&nbsp;
      Briefly the device takes a complex signal such as the sound of an
      orchestra and electricAlly processes it. First, the signal is
      passed into a section which clips everything into a series of
      square waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of clipped waves
      Lisitsyn confirms are the carriers of the human brain waves.&nbsp;
      Next, the square waves are differentiated, since these are finite
      spikes with real non-zero rise times and decay times rather than
      theoretical constructs, a series of noisy spikes results the
      second differentiator section.&nbsp; From here, the noisy spikes
      are introduced to special contact electrodes which are placed on
      the skin.&nbsp; The electrodes are fabricated of zirconium
      titanate Embedded in acrylic plastic tiles to provide maximum
      impedance match to the skin itself.<br>
      <br>
      In experiments done at Tufts University near Boston by Dr Dwight
      Batteau in Man-Dolphin communications and assisted by Dr Flanagan,
      it was established that the nervous system uses time ratios as
      major sources of intelligent information. It was found that speech
      intelligibility was contained in time dominant ratios of the
      speech waveform. Speech quality was found to be contained in
      dominant frequency ratios. So the nervous system is designed to
      recognize two distinct parameters: the time domain and the
      frequency domain.<br>
      <br>
      Based partially upon work done at Tufts University, it is known
      that the human voice does not depend upon frequencies.&nbsp;
      People who have had their larynx removed can use an "artificial
      larynx", a buzz generator held against the side of the throat.
      Word information is formed by the action of the jaw, tongue,
      teeth, glottis, and the nasal cavities.&nbsp; The human nose and
      mouth forma variable time delay generator.&nbsp; Thus, the basic
      audio information our brains evolved to decipher, the human voice,
      is dependent not upon frequency but upon the time rate of change
      nature of sound caused by time delays imposed by the mouth and
      nasal passages.<br>
      <br>
      The Neurophone makes use of these research results by suppressing
      the frequency domain and amplifying the time domain of the
      incoming signal. This is one reason why the Neurophone sounds so
      scratchy when one first begins to listen to it. The electronic
      circuitry of the Neurophone presents audio information to the skin
      in the way the skin originally evolved to receive and decode the
      information eons ago. Thus the Neurphone directly inputs
      information into the brain and nervous system, and even the mind,
      bypassing all the normal sensory systems that lie between the
      mind/brain loop and the outside environment.<br>
      <br>
      Since all of the acupuncture meridians are present on the surface
      of the skin, we found some very interesting affects when the skin
      was activated by the Neurophone.&nbsp; All the subjects of the
      experiment were muscle tested for one major muscle for each of the
      twelve meridians bilaterally. The meridians were recorded as under
      active for muscle weak in the clear and over active for muscles
      that became weak only by stimulation of the alarm point for its
      respective meridian. The subjects were then connected to the
      Neurophone by placing the electrodes on the skin of the forehead
      just lateral and superior to the eyes. K-Y Jelly was used to
      enhance the contact between the skin and the electrodes.&nbsp; A
      tape recording of pink noise was then played through the
      Neurophone for a period of two minutes and then the muscles were
      retested after removal of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
      <br>
      Table 1 represents the totals of 10 different patients who went
      through the experiment.&nbsp; Out of the 240 meridians tested,
      85.8% of the unbalanced ones found, were corrected.&nbsp; The
      Neurophone appears to have a beneficial effect on the body.&nbsp;
      On subsequent visits, the meridians were remaining in balance two
      weeks later.&nbsp; Some of the many comments from the patients
      included: cessations of seizures, improved sleep, total
      relaxation, improved respiration, better concentration, and
      cessation of pain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADDITIONAL RESEARCH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To be certain the Neurophone was not operating by bone conduction,
      a simple experiment was done, known as the Batteau test in honor
      of the hearing research of the late Dr Dwight Batteau who
      developed the test during the Neurophone evaluation at Tufts
      University.<br>
      <br>
      Two separate channels of auditory information were used. One
      channel goes through a set of ordinary headphones, the other goes
      through the Neurophone.&nbsp; One specific frequency is played
      through the headphone channel. Another frequency slightly
      different is played through the Neurophone circuitry to the
      transducer disks. If the Neurophone was producing hearing by bone
      conduction, the two slightly different frequencies would "mix" in
      the bone structures of the inner ear, producing a discernible
      "beat frequency" which is the difference between the two
      frequencies.&nbsp; With the Neurophone, this "beat" is heard only
      at very high volume levels in both channels, levels at which the
      Neurophone is probably producing bone conduction by the strong
      vibration of the skin under each transducer disk. However, the
      beat frequency should theoretically be heard at all volume levels;
      it is not heard at normal neurophonic listening levels.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>LOOKING AHEAD</b><br>
      <br>
      Although the present experiment was a relatively simple one, the
      implications of future possibilities are tremendous.&nbsp; The
      following ideas may well serve as topics of future research papers
      and I invite all the members of the I.C.A.K. to pursue them,
      either on their own or in conjunction with me.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the possibilities for which there is already some evidence
      are:<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp; Increase in telepathic awareness.<br>
      2.&nbsp; A brain/mind link between two or more people. T.E.
      Bearden has developed a mathematical formula that indicates that
      the combined mind power of a group of people will multiply
      exponentially if these people are linked in a unitary
      consciousness.<br>
      3.&nbsp; Subliminal learning may be accomplished by the subject
      material being played through the Neurophone at a low volume
      level. No conscious effort is made to learn the material. This
      could even be accomplished while the student is asleep.<br>
      4.&nbsp; Conscious learning may be accomplished by simultaneously
      listening to tape recorded data by means of Neurophone and
      headphones. In this way, the learning centers of the brain are
      being accessed by at least two separate channels.<br>
      5.&nbsp; Positive subliminal programs to alter undesirable habits:
      i.e. weight control, smoking control, and creation of positive
      mental attitude.<br>
      6.&nbsp; Control the aging process by means of positive cellular
      programming via the Neurophone.<br>
      7.&nbsp; Totally deaf people being able to the recorded audio.<br>

      <br>
      In 1958, when I was fourteen years old, a close friend of mine,
      Lou Macko, a television repairman in Houston, Texas told me of a
      most unusual phenomenon. He told me of a device that would
      transmit sound to the brain without using the ears.<br>
      <br>
      The description of the device had been given to him by a complete
      stranger when he had visited Chicago. The device consisted of two
      copper mesh scrub pads with wires attached to them.&nbsp; The pads
      were placed in a pair of plastic bags to act as insulators. The
      wires were then connected to the high voltage side of an audio
      output transformer which was connected back to back with the
      output of an ordinary record player.<br>
      <br>
      The result is shown in the figure.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage from the Hi Fi was stepped up a bit and applied to the
      pads. If the pads were placed on the skin of the head in the
      vicinity of the temples, one would "hear" the sound from the Hi Fi
      as if it were coming from within the head itself.<br>
      <br>
      The item at that time had no practical advantage as it was
      extremely distorted. A good deal of the sound seemed to be missing
      as if it were cut off.<br>
      <br>
      I researched at the library and discovered the phenomenon was
      known as far back as 1800 and was discovered by Volta. It was
      called electrophonic hearing. It was believed that the phenomenon
      was merely the action of the muscles being electrically stimulated
      and affecting the bones in the ear by means of minute muscle
      vibration.<br>
      <br>
      I examined the signal from the device by oscilloscope and
      discovered the sound came through in a blast when the transformer
      was overloaded and produced a sharp spike or ringing on the wave
      form.&nbsp; I soon discovered that the real information was coming
      through only when this effect occurred. This explained why only
      parts of the music and voice came through.<br>
      <br>
      I reasoned that the true carrier of information was a radio signal
      due to the oscillation produced by shock excitation of the
      combined circuit of the transformer and the parallel tuned circuit
      formed by the electrodes and the human body. I started
      experimenting with the unit using a high frequency oscillator of
      my own design and discovered a resonance in the circuit around
      40,000 cycles per second. I soon found that the resonant frequency
      would change abruptly with emotions and general body changes. The
      capacitance of the electrodes, therefore the dielectric constant
      of the skin, changed abruptly from the slightest outside stimulus.
      The dielectric constant of the skin would change by several orders
      of magnitude in a fraction of a second! After preliminary
      measurement of parameters, I designed the original Neurophone
      which is illustrated in my patent on the device. (#3,393,279)<br>
      <br>
      The device was essentially a high voltage frequency modulated
      radio transmitter of low power. Its frequency was adjustable to
      correct for changes of resonance. The original unit was hand
      adjustable. Later units were automatically tuned for maximum
      resonance.<br>
      <br>
      The addition of the resonant radio carrier wave made the
      difference. The sound from the device was fantastic, like sound
      from another world. The normal frequency response of the ear was
      extended beyond normal boundaries and there was no distortion.<br>
      <br>
      I began experimenting with a number of people who were considered
      to be totally nerve deaf, that is, they were unable to hear
      anything, even with what is known as bone conduction.&nbsp; The
      results were spectacular.&nbsp; People who had not heard in years
      were now hearing sounds they only dreamed of ever recapturing. A
      patent was applied for, and my research continued.<br>
      <br>
      The press learned of my discovery and articles appeared on the
      front pages of 300 newspapers, and it was picked up by news
      syndicates and international magazines around the world.&nbsp;
      LIFE did an article in Sept 14, 1962 page 69, 72. The results were
      as spectacular as the discovery. We received hundreds of thousands
      of letters from all over the world. Letters came from as far away
      as Tasmania addressed only to Pat Flanagan, Inventor, Texas,
      U.S.A.&nbsp; The U.S. Postal service did a spectacular job in
      getting the mail to the right party.<br>
      <br>
      There were many Neurophone discoveries not made public. On
      occasions the device stimulated perfect telepathic contact between
      one or more persons, often with startling results.&nbsp; These
      telepathic incidents were kept under wraps for fear of ridicule.<br>

      <br>
      Definitions: CRT = Critical Reaction Time<br>
      <br>
      In a purely rate of onset pulse information system, the pulse rate
      of the system and the pulse amplitude of the system would remain
      the same. The things which will be varied, are the slope of the
      leading edge of the pulse,<br>
      and inversely the width.<br>
      <br>
      In this system, the amplitude,(e) of the pulse remains the same;
      so does the repeition rate of the signal. The only things to be
      changed are the slope and thus the width of the top of the
      pulse.&nbsp; From now on, the slope in degrees will be represented
      by (à), and the width at the top will be represented by (T). We
      can then formulate an empirical formula for the relationship of à
      to T.&nbsp; (T measured in usec).&nbsp; T=K/à&nbsp; as à=45
      degrees, T=0 or T=max time, à=0 degrees.&nbsp; K= conversion
      factor.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore T also equals I (instantaneous audio information).<br>
      <br>
      The width of the entering pulse with no information must be equal
      to the CRT of the nervous system at any given instance. Then the
      slope of the pulse and thus the width at the top are varied, so is
      the response of the system. A pulse of the same amplitude but of
      the wrong width for the CRT of the neuron will only partially load
      the neuron. The amount or amplitude of the loaded signal in the
      neuron will be proportional to the width of the pulse as it is
      varied.<br>
      <br>
      Now, if a sine wave is loaded into the system, the frequency of
      the wave must be varied so that the width of the wave will
      coincide with the varying CRT of the loaded system, otherwise the
      sine wave will have no effect on the neuron...ie, very little.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown by my experimentation with the effects of
      adrenergia and cholinergia on the nervous system, that as the body
      goes into the state of adrenergia, the frequency of the carrier
      must be increased to meet the smaller CRT of the nerves introduced
      by the addition of adrenaline and acetylcholine into the system.
      And, as the body goes into a state of cholinergia, the opposite is
      true, the frequency must be lowered, due to the increased CRT.
      Otherwise no information can be transmitted into the system. In
      adrenergia, the excited state, the K ion mobility is increased and
      the CRT is smaller....thus requiring a higher frequency. In the
      case of cholinergia, the opposite is true.<br>
      <br>
      Lets now analyze a 30 KHZ sine wave as applied to the nervous
      system and see what the nervous system sees. The sine wave is
      clipped at e and the width of the top of the clipped wave is &lt;
      15 usec. Now, if the nervous system at this instant has a CRT of
      approx 15 usec perfect loading will occur.<br>
      <br>
      Now, if the CRT of the nervous system at this moment should change
      to 20 usec, the carrier would have to be shifted to 25 KHZ to
      obtain the same response.&nbsp; This increase in CRT would
      indicate that the person had gone into a state of
      cholinergia.&nbsp; The new CRT of the neuron would now cause the
      neuron to be improperly loaded at 30 KHZ, but properly loaded at
      25 KHZ.<br>
      <br>
      Now we will look and see what the effects of modulated and
      unmodulated carrier have on the system at the neurons CRT.
      According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the output frequency
      generated by a neuron is proportional to the amplitude of the
      stimulus, until the stimulus reaches a certain level and the
      frequency then remains the same is.. the clipping level of the
      system. The completely loaded neuron will then be receiving
      maximum stimulus and will then be generating a frequency of its
      own in proportion to the loaded voltage. At this loading in the
      unmodulated carrier, a series of meaningless pulses are being
      generated and sent to the brain where they are probably rejected
      and passed off as random noise.<br>
      <br>
      Now let us look at a tone modulated carrier (AM Signal) and see
      what happens with some information input. The pulse width at the
      top (clipping) now varies with change in carrier amplitude at the
      audio tone modulation frequency. The loading voltage of the neuron
      will now vary with the audio rate....the varying width of the top
      of the pulse now follows a pattern of widths in time with the
      audio tone.<br>
      <br>
      The overall process: (Audio) I = varies T and which vary e loading
      in neuron which generates freq to the brain. We now have a system
      that detects and interprets rate of change into the neuron's own
      coding system. Or, as applied to a purely rate of onset modulation
      system with a pulse input instead of a sine wave input.&nbsp; We
      now have a coded conversion system for introducing information
      into the nervous system.<br>

      The very young man above is standing on his head because he says
      it helps him think. It evidently does. Pat Flanagan, a 17 year old
      inventor from Bellaire, Texas, is already nipping at the heels of
      the venerable 30 and 40 year old scientist and inventors who built
      the remarkable structures seen on pages 54 to 65. Pat has just
      perfected a remarkable machine of his own which one day may help
      deaf people hear and blind people see.&nbsp; It may also earn him
      a million dollars.&nbsp; Pat treats his imminent collision with
      success with equanimity, for he reckons and who is to gain say him
      nowadays that the generation which will take over from the take
      over generation will find nothing is impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Pat Flanagan is a unique and self spurred teenage boy who has
      forged his mind and body into the model of a mature and
      inquisitive scientist. At the same time he reflects the more
      standard teenage model; he is the twist champion of Bellaire a
      suburb of Houston a moderate party goer and girl chaser, the
      holder of a private pilots license, and a spectacular gymnast.
      Despite his ability to function in two worlds, Pat leaves no doubt
      which one he favors.&nbsp; There are far too many kids my age who
      are willing to just get along. Pat is confident in his ability to
      do a lot more than just get along.<br>
      <br>
      His single minded belief in his abilities began with a compelling
      dream he had when he was 8 years old. In the dream I was told I
      had to learn all about physics and electronics, he says.&nbsp; And
      it told me I should help people.&nbsp; Already an athletic boy
      able to do 300 pushups a day, he thereupon set out to improve his
      mind. By the time he was 13 he was repairing television sets
      during summer vacations, trying to earn money to build an
      electronic laboratory in his attic.<br>
      <br>
      Pat's restless imagination drove him to tireless sessions in his
      laboratory. To abet them he solicited a rare favor from his
      parents and his older brother Mike the privilage to experiment
      there undisturbed. One weekend last October, Pat started the
      experiment which led to the development of his particular
      fantastic machine. Starting with a radio transmitter he had
      designed himself, he tried modulating its waves to see if he could
      induce hearing in his nervous system without going through the
      normal channels of hearing. He hooked his radio to a small
      transmitter which looked like an earmuff. After 34 hours of work,
      he stopped up his ears, put the earmuff to his head and found he
      still could hear.<br>
      <br>
      I ran downstairs to tell somebody anybody. I woke my mom. She just
      rolled over and said to me, thats nice, Pat, but Ill listen to it
      in the morning. She did listen in the morning and a lot of very
      important people have been listening to Pat ever since.<br>
      <br>
      Pat calls his device the neurophone and the process it operates by
      neuroception. Essentially what it does, he thinks, is transmit
      electrical messages identical to those sounds generate through the
      bodys nervous system direct to the brain.&nbsp; Hence he can place
      the neurophones earmuff on someones spine or solar plexus, plug up
      his subjects ears, and the person will still hear.&nbsp; Obviously
      if the neurophone in fact does what it seems to do, Pat has come a
      long way toward short circuiting the body's ordinary sensory
      processes and giving man, unprecedented access to his brain.&nbsp;
      Other inventors many with a lot more experience and facilities
      than Pat have been seeking such a device for years, and Pat
      explains his success verses their failure as a product of his own
      vigorous one man approach to science. I believe research in the
      problem of electronic hearing has been limited because inventors
      haven't been able to use human subjects as guinea pigs.&nbsp; An
      animal cant tell you just what he heard or how clearly he heard
      it.&nbsp; But I was my own guinea pig and I wasn't restricted by
      the possible bad effects, and I got the secret.<br>
      <br>
      There is some question as to just what Pat has got even he has no
      firm knowledge of why his neurophone works but no question
      whatever that somehow he has onto something valuable.&nbsp;
      Several companies have expressed interest in buying the rights to
      the neurophone and one Corpus Cristi firm has tentatively offered
      him a million dollars if the machine can be adapted to send visual
      images into the brains of blind people. Dr. William O. Davis of
      Stamford, Conn Hyuck Corporation, a research and development
      company which is also fascinated by the neurophone says, The
      ability to detect radio signals in the brain is a remarkable
      phenomenon. If we never learn more about Pats invention, even if
      we never learn why it works, it certainly is a utilitarian
      breakthru which could help a number of people. Davis, who used to
      run the Air Forces basic research program, adds, its important to
      realize that young Flanagan had the necessary intuition to invent
      his neurophone. You make discoveries intuitively, in the same
      manner you would paint a picture or write a symphony.<br>
      <br>
      Pat wants to go on to college, but he is worried about fettering
      his talent: I seek the knowledge college will provide, but I never
      want to be just satisfied with what someone else has written and
      done. He hopes, as his skills increase, to probe other recesses of
      mens mind. I believe someday the entire concept of medical
      practice will be changed by electronics, he says. People will be
      treated electronically rather than with medicine. If God can make
      the earth and sky and the force that people and trees live, then
      inventing anything less than this should be relatively simple.<br>
      <br>
      Statements like this one tend to prove a bit abrasive to Pats
      classmates. Pats a wise guy, plenty cocky, and sure of himself,
      one says, but the bad part of it is hes just that much better at
      anything he sets his mind to do.<br>
      <br>
      Pat claims this reaction does not bother him I want to be
      accepted, sure, but some people were cutout to go full tilt. Pats
      hands and mind are always going full tilt of late. The books
      strewn across his cluttered attic laboratory range from Zen to
      Karate to electronic journals to the Hidden Persuaders. Lights
      glow from a wave testing machine and he is working on a new way of
      tuning TV sets.<br>
      <br>
      People think I've accomplished so much in life, he says.&nbsp;
      They say what else can you do , and all that stuff.&nbsp; But I
      know where I'm going and I know what I have to do. When I die I
      want to leave behind something which will greatly affect and help
      everyone.<br>

      This year the neurophone concept has now reached maturity. It was
      developed 21 years ago this year. The entire history of the
      neurophone reads like a James Bond mystery novel.&nbsp; We are
      currently writing a full length book on the neurophone story, and
      expect to publish this next year. For the present, we will give
      you a synopsis of the neurophone story, and bring the reader up to
      date on the current development of the neurophone Mk XI, the
      eleventh model in a long chain of discovery. following the basic
      history of the neurophone, we will give instructions for the set
      up and use of the neurophone.<br>
      <br>
      The first neurophone was developed when I was 14 years old. A
      brief description of the original device is given in the book
      PYRAMID POWER. The<br>
      original neurophone patent #3,393,279, describes a high voltage,
      high frequency, amplitude modulated radio oscillator. This device
      made the listener into a radio receiver.&nbsp; It transmitted
      sound information to the user by means of small insulated
      electrodes.&nbsp; The 3000 volt signal produced an electric field
      of extremely low power density.&nbsp; As the carrier frequency was
      in the vicinity of 50 Khz, and the capacitance of the electrodes
      was therefore extremely low.&nbsp; The above electrical conditions
      of low power density indicate that the original device was safe
      for use.&nbsp; However, if the electrode surfaces were scratched,
      the user would experience a mild, but annoying mild electric
      shock.<br>
      <br>
      When I originally received the idea for the first neurophone, I
      was a child of 14, and did not have funds to hire a patent
      attorney. One of my fathers friends was a patent attorney for
      Shell Development Corporation, and agreed to help me write my own
      application.&nbsp; Over the years, I became very familiar with
      patent law, as the patent examiner in Washington said the
      neurophone could not possibly work, as it defied ALL present laws
      of neurophysiology.&nbsp; The patent fight over the neurophone
      went on for many years, finally resulting in complete rejection by
      the examiner, closing the file forever with no recourse.<br>
      <br>
      In a brilliant move, my patent attorney (I could afford one by
      now) suggested that we go to Washington and demonstrate the
      neurophone to the examiner in a final attempt to gain
      approval.&nbsp; When we arrived at the patent office, the examiner
      had a real surprise waiting for us, he had arranged for a deaf
      employee of the patent office to be present for the
      demonstration!&nbsp; The deaf gentleman was nerve deaf in one ear,
      and almost totally deaf in the other ear.&nbsp; When the deaf
      employee heard high frequency sounds for the first time in 15
      years, he wept for joy.&nbsp; The examiner then reopened the
      neurophone file, and issued the patent giving the original filing
      date.<br>
      <br>
      By the time the patent was actually issued, a company in New York
      owned by Joseph Lawrence, and Andreja Puharich was infringing on
      my patent. It seems that they had applied for a similar patent
      several months after I had applied for mine.&nbsp; As I was the
      first to file, and had pursued the patent, I won the device.&nbsp;
      The small New York company bought the patent, and by means of
      legal maneuvers, succeeded in causing me to lose a small fortune
      in the process.&nbsp; This was due to their issuance of lettered
      stock which tumbled to a fraction of its original value by the
      time the SEC allowed me to sell it.<br>
      <br>
      We have actually gone far ahead of our story, so we will backtrack
      a little. During the years in which I battled the patent office
      for the original patent many events took place.&nbsp; When I was
      17 years old, LIFE magazine called and wanted to do an article on
      the device. When I was 14, I had received national publicity on
      the front pages of 300 newspapers. After the LIFE article came
      out, I was offered up to $8,000,000 for the patent rights. The
      press coverage was unbelievable. The Ive Got a Secret show (Gary
      Moore) invited me to New York, and millions of people saw the
      neurophone demonstrated on Bess Meyerson. It was during this show,
      when I first met Puharich and Lawrence.<br>
      <br>
      Puharich invited me to lunch at the Twenty One club, along with G.
      Harry Stine, a scientist under the employ of a firm in Connecticut
      known as Huyck Corporation. Stine's company was interested in the
      rights to the&nbsp; neurophone.<br>
      <br>
      When all the offers were in, my parents and my Houston attorney
      agreed that the neurophone should be given to Huyck. After
      examining the device for two years, Huyck said the device could
      not be patented, and dropped it into my hands once again. By this
      time, I was under extreme pressure, as I was once again given the
      task of pursuing the patent on my own limited funds. At the same
      time, Puharich and Lawrence kept urging me to give up, saying that
      they had me beat in the patent office.<br>
      <br>
      In 1964, I was offered a position at Tufts University near Boston.
      Dr. Dwight Wayne Batteau, a professor at Tufts had an intense
      interest in the neurophone as it might play a role in man dolphin
      communications. Dr. Batteau had a small company known as Listening
      Inc., along with a brilliant electronics man: Steve Moshier.
      Listening had extensive contracts with the ONR (Office of Naval
      Research), and was subcontracting Tufts in some of its research
      and development work.<br>
      <br>
      Our first task was to establish the limits and parameters of the
      neurophone as it would apply to dolphins. Our secondary task was
      to determine the physiological mechanism by which the device
      worked.<br>
      <br>
      Dolphins have extremely large brains, and communicate on many
      levels. We considered that the neurophone would open a channel to
      the dolphin which was not previously accessible.<br>
      <br>
      In our initial testing, we found that the neurophone produced a
      minute mechanical vibration in the skin under the electrodes. When
      one person was listening to the device, other people standing near
      the electrodes could hear the sounds coming from the skin.&nbsp;
      If a stethoscope was placed in contact with the users skin, the
      vibration could be heard loudly, and clearly. Our initial effort
      was to determine if this vibration was producing bone conduction,
      or was the skin vibration merely an artifact?<br>
      <br>
      Doctor Batteau came up with an ingenious experiment to determine
      if the skin vibration was actually leading to bone conduction: If
      the neurophone were a separate acoustic channel into the brain, we
      should be able to play two discordant sounds into the brain of an
      ordinary person, one by neurophone, and one by earphones through
      the ears. If bone conduction were involved, the sounds would mix
      or beat in the bone structures of the inner ear, producing a
      discord.&nbsp; In the process of bone conduction, sounds are
      transmitted through bony skeletal structures to the inner ear,
      where the small bones normally vibrated by the ear drum are
      activated by skeletal vibration.&nbsp; This vibration is then
      encoded by the inner ear, and transmitted to the brain by means of
      the 8th cranial nerve.&nbsp; We are sure that the neurophone did
      make use of another channel, due to the fact that people with 8th
      cranial nerve damage had heard with the device.<br>
      <br>
      In our experiment, we played one frequency of sound into the
      neurophone, and another frequency into the headphones through the
      ears. If bone conduction were involved, the sounds would mix as
      predicted in the inner ear, and a discord would be perceived by
      the test subjects (Tufts psychology students).&nbsp; If the
      channel to the brain were a separate one, the signals would be
      heard simultaneously with no discord.&nbsp; At low volume levels,
      the students were able to perceive the separate sounds with no
      mixing. At higher volume levels, a mixing could be heard.<br>
      <br>
      We then ran the same experiment by playing the sounds through
      stereo headphones, with each signal going into separate ears. The
      results were exactly the same as the neurophone experiment.&nbsp;
      At low volume levels, the signals were indeed perceived apart from
      each other.&nbsp; At higher volume levels, the discord could be
      perceived.<br>
      <br>
      The higher volume discordant mixing can be explained by neural
      intermodulation possibly taking place in the corpus callosum, the
      small nerve bundle which connects the left and right hemispheres
      of the brain together. We tested a number of Tufts students, and
      they all had identical results.&nbsp; Wayne Batteau was so
      excited, that he suggested we write a letter to Science, for
      publication.&nbsp; Our letter is duplicated in the appendix.<br>
      <br>
      As the neurophone was now proven to be a separate brain
      communication channel, Doctor Batteau made an offer for rights to
      the device. He offered to give me a 1/3 interest in Listening, a
      5% royalty, and position of Vice President in charge of
      research.&nbsp; The idea was to develop the neurophones potential
      in many areas, including its potential as an interface (electronic
      corpus collosum) between man and dolphin, and play EEG signals
      from a human brain into the dolphin; and to reverse the procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Our work was progressing at a satisfactory rate, when tragedy
      struck Listening. Wayne Batteau died of a heart attack in shallow
      water while swimming near our dolphin facility on Oahu,
      Hawaii.&nbsp; When he died, the Navy canceled our contracts and
      Listening began to fold.&nbsp; Shortly after that, we demonstrated
      the neurophone to the patent examiner, and the rest is history.<br>
      <br>
      While investigating man dolphin communications, we succeeded in
      developing a language translator, a device that translated human
      speech into dolphin language, and vise versa.&nbsp; This
      development required a thorough understanding of the nature of
      speech, and information theory.&nbsp; We made many efforts to
      model the nervous system, and succeeded in demonstrating that the
      nervous system uses time ratios as major sources of intelligent
      information. We then began to investigate timing ratios in speech
      patterns of humans and dolphins. During that period, we found that
      speech intelligibility was contained in time dominant ratios in
      the speech waveform.&nbsp; We found that speech quality was
      contained in dominant frequency ratios.&nbsp; So, the nervous
      system is designed to recognize two distinct parameters: the time
      domain, and the frequency domain.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the knowledge gained in this area, I designed a
      circuit which suppressed the frequency domain, while amplifying
      the time domain. This device, was so radical in approach, that I
      applied for a patent on it as a specialized speech
      processor.&nbsp; Six months after the patent was applied for, the
      National Security Agency placed the patent application under a top
      secrecy order #756,124.&nbsp; The order said that my invention was
      being suppressed in the interest of National Security.&nbsp; It
      further stated that I could be tried for treason and shot by
      firing squad if&nbsp; I revealed its working nature to anyone
      other than an authorized government representative.&nbsp; In other
      words they stole it!&nbsp; Needless to say I was very disappointed
      in the system.&nbsp; It took four year, and three law firms to sue
      for release of my invention.&nbsp; We won the battle, and the
      secrecy order was rescinded.&nbsp; Patent #3,647,970 was issued on
      the 7th of March 1972.<br>
      <br>
      In 1974, two years after I wrote Pyramid Power, we spent the night
      in the Great Pyramid. A full description of that event will have
      to wait for the publication of our full length book on the
      neurophone.(see also "Gods of Aquarius" by Brad Stieger a starseed
      book)&nbsp; I can say that I had an experience of enlightenment,
      including a full blown Kundalini Release.&nbsp; After that
      experience, I became a trance medium.&nbsp; During one of my
      trances, the message came through that the speech processing
      patent which was under secrecy so long was in actuality the
      perfect neurophone circuit.&nbsp; Well, this was a surprise, as I
      had never tried the circuit in that way.&nbsp; I must admit, I
      really did not believe it could work as a neurophone.&nbsp; The
      message to try the speech processor as a neurophone kept coming
      and coming until I finally decided to try it out.&nbsp; When I
      tried it, I was in the surprise of my life!&nbsp; It worked! The
      result was the development of the present neurophone Mk XI, the
      finest neurophone to date, and it does not require the use of a
      radio frequency carrier wave.<br>
      <br>
      The clue as to how the neurophone actually works, is contained in
      the skin vibration artifact which we discovered at Tufts
      University. The original neurophone used a high voltage amplitude
      modulated carrier wave to create a molecular vibration in the skin
      itself. The skin became the diaphragm of a biological
      electrostatic vibrator.&nbsp; The skin is piezo electric and
      optoelectric. That is, when the skin is stimulated by an electric
      field, or by a photon field, it will contract and vibrate with
      modulation of the field. If it is mechanically stimulated, it will
      generate its own electric field. In Russia, blind people have been
      trained to see with their fingertips; and in Czechoslavakia, deaf
      people have been trained to hear with their fingertips.<br>
      <br>
      The skin is the largest most complex organ of the living system.
      As we develop in the womb, all organs of sense evolve from the
      skin. The skin involutes and convolutes to form eyes, ears, etc.
      Our research indicates that the skin itself has the latent
      potential of performing all functions of perception.<br>
      <br>
      The neurophone stimulates and develops this latent ability. The
      skin is the organ which receives the signal from the neurophone,
      and converts the incoming signal into a modulated molecular
      vibration which is then interpreted as sound. We could
      theoretically stimulate the sense of sight in a similar way.&nbsp;
      As all acupuncture meridians are present on the surface of the
      skin, we have found that the neurophone stimulation balances all
      the acupuncture meridians by activating the skin!<br>
      <br>
      The neurophone Mk XI converts incoming non-linear acoustic
      information into a time domain amplified signal. This signal is
      then transmitted to a pair of high dielectric constant ceramic
      electrodes which are placed in contact with the skin of the
      head.&nbsp; The electric field (approx 20 Volts RMS) interacts
      with the skin ceramic electrode combination to create a molecular
      vibration in the skin.&nbsp; This is then interpreted by the
      brain.&nbsp; The result is a new modality for coupling information
      to the brain, using the skin itself as the receptor.&nbsp; Bone
      conduction vibrators will not work as a neurophone, as the
      vibratory signal is to gross, the skin itself must vibrate in a
      synchronous mode in accordance with the time encoded information.<br>
      <br>
      Doctor Christopher Hills, in his book Nuclear Evolution states
      that the skin is a second brain, and is the basic organ of
      spiritual and psychic evolution. He states that the skin can be
      trained to develop powers of perception such as telepathy, etc...<br>
      <br>
      The neural information processing system of the human body is
      apparently extremely sensitive to time domain information. Doctor
      Batteau postulated that the nervous system incorporates delay line
      correlation technology to detect time varied information ratios.
      The neurophone Mk XI processing circuit processes the incoming
      complex non linear signal waveform, and amplifies the non
      linearities thus increasing the timing recognition pattern of the
      signal. In the process, the frequency domain is suppressed. The
      time rate of change of the incoming signal is thus
      amplified.&nbsp; This signal is so time dominant, that it can be
      hard clipped or run through a zero crossing detector without
      losing any intelligibility.<br>
      <br>
      This time processed signal is then fed to the pair of high
      dielectric ceramic electrodes. The 20 volt average RMS signal does
      not require a radio carrier to work.&nbsp; As stated earlier, the
      original neurophone design had to actually work by brute force,
      due to the fact that the modulation signal was not processed to
      increase the time domain signal properties.&nbsp; As previously
      stated, the original neurophone produced typical voltages on the
      order of 3000 at a carrier frequency of 50000 hertz.&nbsp; As the
      skin is piezoelectric, and has a dielectric constant in the range
      of 12000, the neurophone electrodes are made of a ceramic material
      designed to provide a maximum impedance match to the skin
      itself.&nbsp; The entire skin electrode system is a piezoelectric
      resonator. Note: The ceramic electrodes are fragile and could
      break if dropped on a hard surface.&nbsp; Be very careful, they
      are expensive to replace.<br>
      <br>
      To obtain the best results from your neurophone experience, you
      should spend at least 1/2 hour per day listening to a broad
      spectrum frequency source in a quiet, relaxing environment.&nbsp;
      It is best to listen with an increased blood flow to the
      brain.&nbsp; The preferred position is an inclined plane of 11
      degrees with the head down.&nbsp; Testing has shown that most
      people go into deep alpha within 30 seconds when placed in this
      position.&nbsp; This state is the most receptive state to listen
      to the neurophone.&nbsp; The neurophone listener can build his own
      incline plane from a board six feet long, and at least 18 inches
      wide.&nbsp; The raised end of the board should be supported at a
      level of 14 inches above the floor.<br>
      <br>
      The electrodes should be placed on the temples, directly behind
      and slightly above the eyes. Do not place on the hair. Although
      the electrodes will work perfectly well without electrode jelly,
      we suggest the use of EEG type electrode jelly, or KY jelly, as
      this improves impedance matching to the skin.&nbsp; If you use KY
      jelly as an electrode cream, smear an even coating over the black
      ceramic of each electrode, and place the electrodes in contact
      with the skin.&nbsp; The electrodes may be held in place by means
      of an EEG type rubber strap, or an ordinary 2 inch ACE bandage may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      After the electrode strap is in position on the head, insert the
      KY coated ceramic electrodes under the strap so the electrodes are
      held securely in contact with the temples.&nbsp; Later, you may
      desire to move the electrodes around to experience different
      sensations.&nbsp; Many neurophone listeners prefer to place one
      electrode in the center of the forehead, on the 3rd eye area, and
      to place the other one on the back of the neck, or on the hand or
      wrist.<br>
      <br>
      The sound source for neurophone listening can be a cassette
      player, a radio, or a stereo HI Fi system. The neurophone should
      be driven from a headphone or a speaker output jack.&nbsp; Your
      neurophone is provided with an audio connector cable with a mini
      plug on the cassette end, and a 1/4 inch phone plug on the other
      end. This will fit most cassette players. If you want to drive the
      neurophone from another source you may have to obtain a different
      wire.&nbsp; Your local Radio Shack store will probably have the
      right one.<br>
      <br>
      In using the neurophone, I generally adjust the sound level of the
      cassette machine to a comfortable listening level as heard through
      the built in loudspeaker of the machine. I then plug the mini plug
      into the earphone jack of the player, and plug the standard phone
      plug into the input jack on the neurophone. Plug the electrode
      phone plug into the neurophone output jack. Rotate the neurophone
      volume control slowly clockwise.&nbsp; The switch on the control
      will turn the unit on. The small LED panel lamp should glow at
      this time. Slowly turn the control up until you begin to hear the
      tape from your cassette player through the neurophone
      electrodes.&nbsp; Depending on the program material to which you
      are listening, the sound which you first hear through the
      neurophone will not sound like Hi Fi. This is due to two things:
      The sound you hear is time domain dominant. 2. As this is a new
      listening channel, the brain actually has missing processing
      capability.&nbsp; If we run a frequency sweep of the neurophone
      while listening, we will find that all of us have certain spectra
      which are entirely missing from our perceptual ability. That is,
      in the beginning we may hear a complex sound wave of one
      millisecond duration (1KHz), but miss entirely a sound of another
      domain. As we listen through the neurophone, the missing ranges
      are programmed into the brain. After listening for as little as 30
      minutes, the sound begins to take on new qualities. The sound
      appears to move around in the head, and take on new dimension as
      we program our psychic brain centers to receive the new signal
      input.&nbsp; The more the neurophone is used, the clearer it gets.
      I recommend electronic music tapes in the beginning, such as the
      astral sound tape.<br>
      <br>
      As the neurophone channel is but one channel into the brain, we
      have found that supplementing the neurophone channel with the
      frequency domain input by means of quality headphones is
      desirable.&nbsp; The reintroduction of the frequency domain
      through the headphones adds a new dimension of sound to the brain
      mind input system. The combination of neurophone plus headphone
      signals provides the best listening combination. For this purpose,
      the neurophone contains a headphone output jack which will accept
      monaural or stereo headphones.&nbsp; The second volume control
      from the left is used to control sound of the headphones.&nbsp; As
      the headphones are driven by the cassette recorder, the&nbsp;
      neurophone must be plugged into a speaker or headphone output
      jack. The neurophone plus headphone adjustment should be made as
      follows: 1. First adjust the sound level to the electrodes with
      the headphone control in the off position.&nbsp; 2. With the
      headphones in place, slowly adjust the level of the headphones to
      supplement the electrode signal.&nbsp; Sit back, or lay back close
      your eyes and let the signals carry you away.<br>
      <br>
      In the near future: Source of Innergy will begin to produce
      cassette tapes designed to be used only with the neurophone. The
      tapes will cover many different categories from: Psychic Center
      Stimulation; to Subliminal Habit Modification Programs. We will
      notify neurophone owners as these tapes become available for
      purchase.<br>
      <br>
      In the beginning, it is not necessary to use special tapes, as the
      object is to develop the latent channel through which the
      neurophone works. This may be done by listening to white noise
      (waterfalls) or your favorite music tapes. Neurophone stimulated
      perceptual enhancement occurs with increasing frequency as you use
      your neurophone.&nbsp; This experience is similar to the
      meditation experience of transcending.&nbsp; These periods of
      extremely clarity become more and more pronounced as you put hours
      on your neurophone. All changes in awareness are not
      gradual.&nbsp; All progress is in the form of discrete
      steps.&nbsp; What may appear to be a gradual altering of
      consciousness is actually a series of graduations.&nbsp; We may
      plod along thinking we are making no forward progress, and at the
      point in time where we feel we want to give up we experience
      quantum leap in awareness.&nbsp; One of the most common awareness
      changes with the neurophone effect is an increase in telepathic
      awareness. Although this cannot be turned on at will, instances of
      its occurrence will increase in frequency as time goes on. Please
      keep a diary of neurophone hours of listening, and make note of
      any change in awareness, dreaming, or unusual perception changes.<br>
      <br>
      We would like all neurophone owners to send us a monthly research
      report or diary of experiences. This is important data which will
      enable us to share with you all experiences, and tune the
      neurophone experience. Keep note of your actual listening time,
      and listening material. If you experience any change in
      consciousness or awareness record this down. Others would like to
      share your experience.<br>

      Retired Lt. Col. Thomas Bearden is a nuclear physicist from George
      Washington University. He is one of the foremost experts in
      warfare strategy, and is an expert in the field of Soviet
      Psychotronics Research.&nbsp; Tom Bearden and I have made two mind
      links by means of the neurophone.&nbsp; Details of the brain mind
      link will be given in a later edition of the Innergy News, or the
      neurophone research journal.&nbsp; Col Bearden has developed a
      mathematical formula that indicates that the combined mind power
      of a group of people will multiply exponentially if these people
      are linked in a unitary consciousness. A small group of people
      could actually alter the entire course of mankind in an instant of
      time, if they were perfectly linked in a unified field of
      consciousness.&nbsp; Col Bearden believes that the neurophone is
      the key to linking consciousness.&nbsp; He believes it may hold
      the answer to solving all the problems of mankind.<br>
      <br>
      This linking could be done in a number of ways. The Soviets have
      established that an EEG machine of only 16 channels could pick up
      the entire consciousness of an individual.&nbsp; All that is then
      necessary, is to feed the data into the mind of another by means
      of a multi channel neurophone.&nbsp; The neurophone would then
      become an electronic corpus collosum between the minds of two or
      more people.<br>
      <br>
      At a given time in the near future, we will notify all neurophone
      owners to all try to listen to the neurophone at an exact time
      period everyday. This will be a simple attempt to unify the
      consciousness of the group.&nbsp; This type of experiment has been
      somewhat successful in the past, when used with group
      meditation.&nbsp; It may be that this experiment will speed up the
      increased awareness brought about by the use of the neurophone.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>THE NEUROPHONE MODEL 50</b><br>
        <b>The THINKMAN</b><br>
        <b>Principles of Operation</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The thinkman is the latest development in the series of
      neurophone devices first invented by Patrick Flanagan in 1959 when
      he was a prolific young inventor of 14.&nbsp; Since that time,
      considerable progress has been made in the development of improved
      neurophone devices, and the thinkman is the fiftieth neurophone
      system developed by Dr. Flanagan.&nbsp; A full and complete theory
      of the neurological, physiological and psychological operation of
      the neurophone is still being pieced together.<br>
      <br>
      How does it work?&nbsp; How is it possible to hear without using
      ones ears? The current hypothesis is based upon the fact that the
      skin is embrionically the source of all our human sense
      organs.&nbsp; In fact, the skin itself contains more sensors, for
      heat, touch, pain, etc., than any other part of the human
      anatomy.&nbsp; The human ear evolves embryonically out of the
      convolutions of the skin of an embryo in the mothers womb.&nbsp;
      Basically, the skin is the oldest evolutionary nervous system
      sensor.&nbsp; Since it is the precursor of the ears, the skin
      should also be capable of hearing and, as the neurophone proves,
      the skin does indeed have this capability.<br>
      <br>
      Neurologically, the human skin is both piezoelectric and
      optoelectric. This means that it produces minute electrical
      currents when vibrated or rubbed. Soviet and Czechoslovakian
      neurological research has also shown that the skin produces an
      electric current when stimulated by light.<br>
      <br>
      As long ago as 1785, Charles Augustin DeCoulomb, a french
      physicist and an early experimenter with electricity, proved that
      an electrostatic field produces a measurable physical force.&nbsp;
      The neurophone processes audio information to produce a very weak
      20 volt RMS electric field at each of its two transducer
      disks.&nbsp; This alternating electric field is changed as a
      function of the time rate of change of the audio signal coming
      into the neurophone.&nbsp; This minute electrical field actually
      causes microscopic vibrations of the skin under the transducer
      disks.&nbsp; Maximum coupling of the electric field to the skin is
      ensured by fabricating the transducer disks from Zirconium
      Titanate which possess the same dielectric constant as human skin.
      If you were to put an ordinary medical stethoscope on the skin
      next to one of the transducer disks while the neurophone is being
      used, you would be able to detect the vibrations of the skin
      created by the tiny electric field of the transducer disk.<br>
      <br>
      Work done by Dr's Patrick Flanagan and Dwight Wayne Batteau at
      Tufts University during the years of 1964-1968 is the basis of the
      current theory regarding how the neurophone works.&nbsp; They
      discovered that the frequency content of the human voice had
      little to do with the brain's ability to recognize intelligence in
      human speech. For example, people who have had their larynx
      removed can use an artificial larynx, a buzz generator or low
      frequency vibrator held against the side of the throat. Words are
      formed totally by the action of the jaw, the tongue, the teeth,
      the glottis, and the nasal cavities. These cavities form a highly
      variable time delay encoding chamber. They found that the basic
      audio information which our brains evolved to decipher, the human
      voice, is dependent not upon frequency but upon the time rate of
      change nature of a sound caused by time delays imposed by the
      mouth and nasal passages. The neurophone makes use of these time
      delay codes<br>
      by processing the incoming audio signal to remove the frequency
      component and leave only the time domain, the time rate of change
      information.&nbsp; This is one reason why the neurophone sounds so
      scratchy when one first begins to listen to it.&nbsp; Thus, the
      electronic circuitry presents audio information to the skin in the
      manner that the skin was originally designed to receive and decode
      such information eons ago.<br>
      <br>
      But is it certain that the neurophone is not operating by bone
      conduction as are some other devices available today for listening
      experiments and enjoyment?&nbsp; A definitive experiment proving
      that bone conduction is not a cause of neurophonic hearing can be
      duplicated by anyone with the required simple equipment. This
      procedure is called the Batteau test, honoring the late hearing
      researcher, Dr Dwight Wayne Batteau, who developed the test during
      neurophone evaluation at Tufts University. Two separate channels
      of audio information are required. One channel goes through a set
      of ordinary headphones, the other goes through the neurophone. One
      specific frequency is played through the headphone channel.
      Another slightly different is played through the neurophone
      circuitry to the transducer disks. If the neurophone were
      producing hearing by bone conduction, the two slightly different
      frequencies would mix in the bone structure of the inner ear
      producing a discernible beat frequency. With the nerophone, this
      beat frequency is heard only at very high volume levels in both
      channels, levels at which the neurophone probably producing bone
      conduction by the strong vibration of the skin under each
      transducer disk. However the beat frequency should theoretically
      be heard at all volume levels and yet it is not heard at normal
      neurophonic listening levels. The neurophonic experience is
      therefore probably a new way to hear, using a new channel into the
      brain: the skin.<br>
      <br>
      The neurophone is an electronic audio information processor
      designed and sold for experimental and entertainment purposes. The
      electronic circuitry of the neurophone accepts an input from any
      audio or Hi Fi system. It converts the audio signal into a digital
      like low voltage electrical signal that activates two small
      transducer disks. These two disks or electrodes may be placed
      anywhere on the bare skin of the listener.&nbsp; When the
      transducers are in contact with the skin, the audio signal will
      then be perceived in the persons head. There are no hazardous
      voltages or currents between the two sensor disks. There are no
      radio frequency carriers involved in the action of the neurophone.
      The neurophone thinkman operates from a 9 volt transistor radio
      type battery which is enclosed in its case.<br>
      <br>
      The audio signal source for the neurophone may be a portable
      cassette tape player, a radio, or a stereo Hi Fi system. Most
      modern cassette tape machines and Hi Fi stereo systems have a
      headphone or external speaker output jack.&nbsp; The neurophone
      output goes through two 1 inch diameter transducer disks
      fabricated of Zirconium Titinate which are imbedded in acrylic
      plastic tiles to protect the brittle disks against breakage.&nbsp;
      The transducer disks are, nevertheless, still fragile and should
      be treated carefully because hard physical shocks will break
      them.&nbsp; If a transducer disk is broken by rough handling, a
      new set of transducer disks may be obtained from us.&nbsp; Insert
      the plug at the end of the transducer lead into the jack labeled
      electrode on the end of the thinkman.<br>
      <br>
      Connect your neurophone to an audio source such as a cassette
      machine by means of an audio connecting cable. The small plug on
      your connecting cable will usually fit into the headphone output
      or external speaker jack on your machine, the other plug on your
      connecting cable will plug into the audio jack on the neurophone.
      Before plugging the cable into your cassette jack, adjust the
      output volume control on your machine to a 50% or higher level to
      ensure that the signal processor on your neurophone is receiving
      an adequate signal level. Turn on the neurophone by rotating the
      volume control in a clockwise direction. The red LED indicator
      light will glow, indicating the neurophone is on. Place the two
      transducer disks on the bare skin on either side of the forehead;
      They may be held in place by the elastic headband supplied with
      the unit.&nbsp; Turn the volume control clockwise to about mid
      way. Turn on your audio source so that the signal will now play
      through the neurophone. Place the electrode disks on the skin of
      your temples, plug up your ears, and the audio signal should be
      heard, appearing to exist in the middle of your head.&nbsp; If
      necessary, adjust the neurophone volume control until the signal
      is heard.<br>
      <br>
      As you become more experienced in neurophone listening, you will
      find that you will be able to place the two transducer disks on
      the bare skin in spots other than the forehead.&nbsp; One
      neurophone listener reports excellent neurophone listening with
      one transducer disk on the soft flesh of one leg and the other
      transducer on the soft skin of the stomach. However, the
      neurophone must be operated at a higher volume setting to obtain
      the same level of neurophone hearing under such remote transducer
      locations. The ability of the transducer disks to function at a
      location of the skin remote from the head is partially explained
      by the current operating hypothesis.<br>
      <br>
      If your neurophone begins to sound weak and the red LED indicator
      on the front panel begins to glow very dimly, replace the battery
      in the unit. Unfasten the four phillips head screws holding the
      bottom on the case and remove the bottom plate.&nbsp; Inside, you
      will find a battery clip and a 9 volt transistor battery.&nbsp;
      Replace the battery with a fresh one.&nbsp; For best results, use
      an alkaline battery which will provide more than 10 hours of
      neurophone use under normal conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The neurophone processes audio information in such a way that the
      frequency domain is eliminated but the time domain is preserved.
      Studies with earlier versions of the neurophone by Tufts
      University for the US Navy as long ago as 1966 indicated that the
      brain initially may have difficulty in recognizing the neurophone
      signals due to gaps in perception. The user may not be able to
      perceive certain frequencies and time domains in portions of the
      audio spectrum. As you use your neurophone, these holes in your
      neurophone hearing process will disappear, as your brain learns to
      recognize these energies, and you will begin to hear neurophonic
      sound with full frequency and wide dynamic range.<br>
      <br>
      The neurophone is an experimental listening device that may by
      continuous use stimulate and enhance dormant perceptive abilities
      in the user. For example, since the device is apparently
      stimulating pathways to the brain that are not used normally, it
      may increase intelligence, telepathic ability, and neural
      efficiency. Dr. Flanagan has used the neurophone longer than
      anyone in existence, and has developed extremely high neural
      efficiency scores. He believes this increase in brain efficiency
      is directly related to the use of the neurophone device. Many long
      term neurophone users report increased awareness, telepathic
      ability, out of body experiences, better memory, and increased
      auditory frequency range. A commercial pilot from Saudi Arabia
      reported a recovery of hearing damage due to aural trauma
      resulting from the loud aircraft engine noise as a result of his
      job. Please note however, that the neurophone is an experimental
      device, and has many uses that have been untapped. The neurophone
      owner will have to experiment and discover his own uses for the
      device. Dr Flanagan used his own neurophone to learn the Arabic
      language; actress Susan Strasberg found that she could learn her
      stage lines easier by playing them through the device. A recent
      book by G. Harry<br>
      Stine, titled THE SILICON GODS by Dell, discusses the possibility
      of using the neurophone as a part of a mind computer link in which
      the power of the human<br>
      mind could be amplified by millions of times. Stine says that the
      entire process is feasible right now, with the help of the
      neurophone and state of the art brain scan technology.&nbsp; Tom
      Bearden, in his book EXCALIBER BRIEFING says that the neurophone
      may eventually be used to successfully enable one or more people
      to do a perfect mind link in which the power of multiple minds may
      solve all world problems.<br>
      <br>
      We hope that neurophone owners will join us in the task of
      discovering and using the potential of the device. The field of
      neurophone research is wide open, in the future we will see the
      development of neurophone software and hardware as well as
      neurophone user's league, our own neurophone magazine, and a host
      of other neurophone support devices. We invite all neurophone
      owners to share their experiences with us, so that we may share
      them with others.<br>

      </b>Pacinian.ASC<br>
      <br>
      The skin contains many energy sensing mechanism, one such
      mechanism is known as the Pacinian Corpuscle.&nbsp; The PC is a
      special nerve ending that transforms mechanical vibrations or
      pressures into nerve impulses.&nbsp; Until this year, (1980) very
      little was known about the transducer, and it was thought that the
      device could only work at low frequencies of stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      Recent research by Fernando Grandori and Antonio Pedotti of Milan,
      Italy has shed a whole new light on this mechanism.&nbsp; (IEEE
      TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, Vol BME-27, #10, Oct
      1980)&nbsp; It now seems that the PC can react to very high
      frequencies, and responds best to a square wave stimulus.<br>
      <br>
      The PC consists of a sensitive nerve ending surrounded by a
      cylindrical-like core structre consisting of closely packed
      membranes called lamellae.&nbsp; The core is surrounded by a
      second set of lamellae, in which the distance between each one
      increases from the innermost lamella toward the periphery of the
      corpuscle.&nbsp; The space between all the lameae is filled with a
      liquid whos mechanical properties can be considered similar to
      that of water. When a displacement of the outermost lamella is
      caused by exerting an appropriate pressure, this stimulus is
      transmitted to the core, and in turn, causes a compression of the
      innermost lamella.&nbsp; This system acts as a differentiating
      mechanical amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      What is significant here, is that the PC responds best to a
      Squarewave.&nbsp; The above paper reveals that rate of change is
      more important than the amplitude of the pressure applied to the
      corpuscule.&nbsp; This indicates that this highly refined receptor
      is designed to detect time significance first, and pressure
      significance secondly.<br>
      <br>
      If we take the Neurophone electrode disks and feed a 50 volt sine
      wave audio signal into them while placing them on the temples, the
      signal will be percieved weakly.&nbsp; If we feed the same signal
      as a square wave, the percieved is 10 times as loud as the sine
      wave.&nbsp; This tends to substantiate Dr Flanagan's theory
      reguarding the Neurophone perceptual mechanism as being&nbsp;
      timerate of change encoded.<br>
      <br>
      PC are located over the entire skins surface, with greater
      concentrations on the fingertips and sexual organs.&nbsp; In 1981
      Dr Flanagan intends to develop research projects which will be
      able to evaluate the PC theory.<br>

        <br>
        <b>A Possible Mechanism for Neurophonic Action</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The Neurophone is a new electronic invention that may enable
      us to hear by a completely new information channel to the
      brain.&nbsp; Ordinary hearing is the result of the stimulation of
      bones in the inner ear by means of vibration.&nbsp; Sound waves
      may reach these bones through ear canal via the ear drum, or by
      bone conduction in which sound waves are conducted to the inner
      ear vibrations in the crainial bones.<br>
      <br>
      When the sound waves reach the inner ear, a vibration is set up in
      the cochlea which then converts the waves into nerve inpulses that
      travel up the 8th Crainial Nerve to the sound recognition centers
      of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      In 1958, Dr Flanagan, then a child of 14 developed a radio
      transmitter that made the brain into a radio receiver. This device
      transmits acoustic information to the brain by means of radio
      waves into the skin, bypassing the 8th Crainial Nerve. When he
      applied for a patent on the device, the patent examiner rejected
      the whole thing saying that such a device would go against all
      known laws of science. Over the following years, Dr Flanagan
      fought against insurmontable odds to prove that the device did
      indeed work. In the meantime, LIFE magazine ran a major article on
      Flanagan and the Neurophone, naming him as one of the top ten
      scientists in the US at the age of 17! In a final desperate move
      Flanagan flew to the patent office with a model of his invention
      and successfully demonstrated the device on a deaf employee in the
      patent examiner's office.&nbsp; The deaf man heard music for the
      first time in 15 years and broke down into tears.&nbsp; The
      examiner declared that the Nurophone was indeed a basic patentable
      device and approved the patent for release.&nbsp; Patent #
      3,393,279 dated 16 July 1968..........<br>
      <br>
      In the years that Dr Flanagan fought to recieve deserved
      recognition by the patent office, he grew into manhood and was
      working on Man-Dolphin Communications for the US Navy when the
      patent was finally issued. While involved in Man-Dolphin research,
      he became interested in nerve signal<br>
      information encoding, and began to develop electronic circuits
      that duplicated the process of pattern recognityion observed in
      the human nervous system. This work led to research in
      Cryptography.&nbsp; During that period he developed a top secret
      sound scrambler that was virtually impossible to decode. Part of
      the scrambler was based on his research into nerve encoding.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Flanagan believed that the pattern of nerve encoding used in
      the human speech recognition system could be used to make a better
      Neurophone. He succeeded in perfecting an electronic curcuit that
      he believes duplicates the precise encoding of the Cochlea and 8th
      Crainial Nerve. When he applied for a patent on the new circuit,
      the patent aplication was immediately placed under top secrecy by
      the National Security Agency. The only explanation given at the
      time was that the circuit had potential uses in the defense of the
      country. Dr Flanagan was happy that the government considered that
      his device could be used in his country's defense. The only
      problem was that the government wanted the devise free, and he
      spent 14 years on it.<br>
      <br>
      He hired attorneys and challenged the secrecy order for over five
      years. At the end of that period, the patent was released from
      secrecy and was approved for issue by the patent office.&nbsp;
      Patent # 3,647,970 dated 7 Mar 1972.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Flanagan then perfected the circuit for another five years.
      This circuit recognizes time-relationships in the signal waveform,
      and generates a square wave that is time encoded.&nbsp; Dr
      Flanagan believes that the nervous system uses a complex deley
      line time recognition computational system that recognises time
      information. (50KHZ square wave pulse width audio modulation with
      double differentiator output)<br>
      <br>
      In July of 1978, he successfully applied the Time Recognition
      Processor to his Neurophone.&nbsp; When an audio signal is
      processed through his circuit, it is converted into a form which
      he believes is an electronic analog of the nerve signal released
      from the human cochlea, but with one major difference; in the
      cochlea hundreds of nerves carry the time-encoded signal to the
      brain.&nbsp; In the case of the Neurophone, the full signal
      processing is complete and may be carried to the brain by
      alternate pathways. Through the skin itself.<br>
      <br>
      In the original Neurophone, a 3000 volt amplitude modulated radio
      wave carried the signal to a pair of insulated electrodes that
      were placed on the head of the subject.&nbsp; In the present
      Neurophone, the voltage has been reduced to a 50 volt (maximum)
      square wave. This signal is applied to the body by means of
      ceramic disks.(zirconium titanate). The ceramic disks allow the
      energy field to affect the skin without a current flow. The small
      electric field causes the skin to vibrate internally in rhythim
      with the stimulation. The intea-dermal vibration can be heard by
      others if they place there own ears near the point of electrode
      skin contact. The vibration is not powerful enough however, to
      vibrate the bone below the skin surface.<br>
      <br>
      For the past year, Dr Flanagan has been developing a theory which
      would explain how the Neurophone actually works in the body. Some
      mechanism must exist that transmits the information from skin to
      the brain.<br>
      <br>
      The Neurophone has been out now for nearly five months, and we are
      starting to get reports back from layman and professional users.
      The inital results are exciting.&nbsp; Several people have
      reported that their ability to remember data is increasing. People
      who could not remember telephone numbers are becoming walking
      phone books!<br>
      <br>
      The first professional research report has been written by Dr
      Sheldon Deal, D.C., N.D.; of Tucson, Az.&nbsp; Dr Deal is director
      of the Swan Clinic, and is current President of the International
      College of Applied Kinesiology.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Deal's preliminary Neurophone research paper was recently
      presented at the I.C.A.K. convention in Detroit. With Dr Deal's
      permission, we are&nbsp; publishing his entire paper in INNERGY
      NEWS.<br>
