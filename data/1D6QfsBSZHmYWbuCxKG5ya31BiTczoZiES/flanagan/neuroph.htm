      <p>When Jerry Pournelli and I started to write these columns as a
        vis-a-vis experiment, we hoped that sooner or later one of us
        would write something that the other could tee off on and thus
        get a good controversy going that would present "alternate
        views." It hasent worked out that way because Jerry and I have
        discovered that we think very much alike on most matters. We
        have not been able to stir up controversy between one another.
        But we did stir up controversy among the readers. </p>
      <p>When I wrote the columns on biocybernetics in the May and July
        1979 issues, my objective was more or less than science
        reporting with some synthesis included. I wanted to point out
        that a true interface between human brains and electronic
        computers was not only possible but that the basic experiments
        have been done and the foundation technologies already existed,
        albeit in the case of the Flanagan neurophone the data had been
        generally unknown for 16 years. I reported on the basis of what
        I knew at that time. I requested that no one write for
        additional data because I didnt have any additional data at that
        time. I do now. </p>
      <p>These two columns have resulted in an inordinate amount of mail
        from readers which makes the editor happy because he knows
        people are reading this. Some of the letters were anticipated,
        some were not. Some were from people who were deaf and wanted
        the Flanagan neurophone at any price. Others wanted the
        neurophone to use in attempts to contact loved family members in
        a coma. There were the usual letters from Ph.Ds who should know
        better than to make some of the statements they did. And I got
        letters with real up to date information... </p>
      <p>You may obtain copies of his two neurophone patents by writing
        to the U.S. Patent Office and ordering Patent No. 3,393,279
        granted July 16, 1968 and Patent No. 3,647,970 granted March 7,
        1972. </p>
      <p>The rights to Patent No. 3,393,279 are owned by Intelectron,
        Inc. of New York City. The FDA will not permit it to be marketed
        because it uses a low frequency r-f carrier, and they are very
        sensitive these days about the biological effects of r-f
        raditation. </p>
      <p>But Pat Flanagan is an inventor. With his original patent
        rights in the hands of another company and with an FDA ban on
        its production, Flanagan developed the second neurophone device
        covered by Patent No. 3,647,970 which does not use an r-f
        carrier and does not involve high voltages. At the behest of the
        Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce placed
        Flanagan's new device under secrecy order No. 756,124 dated
        August 28, 1968. Flanagan was able to get this secrecy order
        rescinded in 1972 to permit the patent to be issued. </p>
      <p>I sat in Flanagan's study and listened to the new neurophone on
        July 26, 1979. It works even better than the original one. It
        operates from eight Type AA alkaline penlight cells. The audio
        signal is double differentiated and converted to a 60 volt
        square wave which is then run through a zero crossing detector.
        The sensor electrodes are one inch diameter plates made from
        lead zirconium titanate insulated on one side with epoxy that
        also seals the attachment of the lead from the neurophone. </p>
      <p>With one electrode placed on the soft skin of my calf and the
        other on my chest, I heard the audio information from the tape
        recorder input in my head. I listened to both speech and music,
        and the fidelity was outstanding. I had a cassette tape recorder
        running two feet from me while this was going on; there is no
        evidence of the audio information recorded on the cassette by
        the recorder; I was the only entity hearing the neurophone, and
        it was therefore not producing and sound waves that the
        microphone of the recorder could pick up. </p>
      <p>As I knew 17 years ago, the Flanagan neurophone works. I dont
        give a doodly damn what all you bloody experts out there have
        presumptuously stated in your outraged fan letters to me. I am
        forced to repeat the immortal words of Dr. J. C. Warren voiced
        after performing the first surgery with a patient under ether
        anesthetic administrated by Dr. William Thomas Green Morton in
        Boston on October 16, 1846: </p>
      <p>"Gentlemen, this is no humbug!" </p>
      <p>For the benefit of all you who wrote me, I gave your letters to
        Flanagan. There is no need for me to be in the loop. There is no
        need for Flanagan to defend himself nor does he need help in
        doing so; he has a device that works. In the eyes of some sober,
        respected academicians, Flanagan is perhaps flamboyant and
        different, but that must not be allowed to detract from the fact
        that he is a successful inventor and, in common with many others
        of his unconventional and freewheeling nature in the history of
        science and technology, working on the fringes of scientific
        research in areas that others can't or won't touch. </p>
      <p>The most fascinating aspect of this whole affair has been the
        confirmation and terrible realization that the human race
        apparently has not progressed beyond the state of affairs a
        century ago when "legitimate" scientist dug in to defend their
        sacred turf....and made damned fools of themselves in the
        process. They also retarded the development of technology that
        would have relieved human suffering and generally improved the
        human condition. These scientific brahmins still exist; they are
        no different from the predecessors of a hundred years ago; and
        they exhibit an appalling lack of knowledge and understanding of
        the history of their own field of expertise! </p>
      <p>Arthur C. Clarke's law is still very much in force. </p>
      <p>Jerry Pournelle was 100% correct in his June 1979 "The
        Alternate View." </p>
      <p>I would like to extend my profound thanks and grateful
        appreciation to those scientific brahmnis who wrote to me and to
        the editor about the neurophone and the human computer
        interface. You have greatly contributed to the contents of my
        "Utter Bilge" file. This is my collection of presumptuous
        statements from people who should know better than to make such
        statements in the first place. The file title derived from in
        infamous statement of Sir Richard Van Der Riet Wolley: "Space
        travel is utter bilge!" </p>
      <p>Scientific research and technical progress is not and has never
        has been the exclusive turf of any select group of people. There
        has always been a role for the amateur investigator, and still
        exists today. Before the "official" establishment of any new
        area of scientific endeavor, everyone who works in that area
        must, by definition, be an amateur. Even in the established
        fields of scientific endeavor, important discoveries have been
        made by amateur investigators. Good scientists and I have the
        pleasure of knowing many would never reject out of hand any
        amateur findings and will react with enthusiasm and interest to
        such findings. It is only poor scientists who are insecure that
        will react negatively. Would there were more good scientists! </p>
      <p>Bioelectronics today is about the same situation as electricity
        about a century ago. The field is ripe for experimentation.
        Certainly there is danger; there always is. But that is no
        reason for suppressing information, as one PhD. correspondent
        demanded be done, for fear of someone electrocuting himself by
        building a neurophone in his basement shop. People still get
        hurt in steam boiler explosions. As a matter of fact, people
        still get burned handling the ancient technology of a campfire.
        These accidents merely strengthen the statement of Herbert
        George Wells, "History is a race between education and
        catastrophe," but down on the personal level. </p>
      <p>To paraphrase Harold Laski, science by experts means, after a
        time, science in the interest of experts..... </p>

      <p>Last time around, two issues ago, I reported on the process
        made by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
        concerning computer recognition of human EEG patterns. I stated
        that this was a major breakthrough in the development of the
        true intelligence amplifier wherein the human nervous system was
        linked directly with the electronic circuitry of a large general
        purpose computer. Soon, the crystalline circuitry of the
        computer will be able to "understand" the colloidal circuitry of
        the human nervous system by direct linkage through
        electromagnetic fields. </p>
      <p>And I left you hanging by your fingernails on a figurative
        cliff overhanging an ammonia sea swarming with methane monsters,
        so to speak. </p>
      <p>I stated that seventeen years ago the breakthrough had been
        made that would permit the colloidal circuitry of the nervous
        system to "understand" the crystalline circuitry of the
        electronic computer. In other words, if the computer signal was
        in the proper form, the human nervous system could pick up and
        decipher the electronic computer signal through an
        electromagnetic field. </p>
      <p>In early 1962, I was working as assistant director of research
        for the Huyck Corporation in Milford, Connecticut. Dr. William
        O. Davis was the director of research, and he had been charged
        by the company to look for new products to insure that Huyck
        would be in business twenty five years hence. There were no
        caveats placed on us at that time. We could look at or for
        anything....and we did. Then as now I have all sorts of
        pipelines into the back rooms of various research and
        development organizations here and abroad; a science fact or
        science fiction writer really cant function properly without
        these contacts. My most valuable Little Black Spy was the former
        editor of this magazine. John W. Campbell, who in turn had an
        incredible network of Little Black Spies. </p>
      <p>Campbell told me of an 18 year old boy in Texas who had
        invented a spectacular new hearing aid. I made a telephone call,
        talked to the boy, and was on a plane to Houston within days. </p>
      <p>G. Patrick Flanagan of Ballaire Texas was a boy genius. In
        addition to being an outstanding gymnast and a pilot, this high
        school graduate had stumbled upon a technique of introducing
        audio information directly into the human nervous system without
        loudspeakers or earphones, and without direct electrical
        connection between his gadget and the nervous system. </p>
      <p>On July 24, 1962 in Bellaire, Texas in Flanagan's shop in the
        attic of his parents home, I personally witnessed
        proof-of-principle demonstration of a direct linkage between a
        crystalline electronic circuit and the colloidal system of the
        human nervous system. </p>
      <p>The device called the "neurophone" by Flanagan, was a very
        simple gadget. It used those ancient devices known as vacuum
        tubes. It used a 6L6G tube running as a 35 Kilohertz oscillator;
        the output of the oscillator was amplitude-modulated by the
        output of ant single channel hi-fi system through suitable
        impedance matching transformers, etc. This amplitude modulated
        35 kilohertz signal then went through a cheapie stepup
        transformer so that the output was very high voltage (about 4
        kilovolts, as I remember) but at very high impedance. Flanagan
        fed this signal through a length of ordinary TV antenna twin
        lead to a pair of rubber pads about six inches in diameter that
        he had filched from a "relaxicisor" muscle relaxing device. Each
        pad consisted of a 1/16 inch thick rubber sheet, a piece of
        copper window screen to which was soldered one of the wires of
        the twin lead, and the rubber covering of the relaxicisor pad.
        The rubber insulation kept one from getting zapped, although the
        shock wasnt painful....just annoying. </p>
      <p>Put a signal into the neurophone input, peak the frequency,
        peak the modulation to 100%, and then hold the two pads to your
        body....anywhere. </p>
      <p>And you heard music playing in your head! </p>
      <p>Although the pads worked better and you got a louder signal
        with the pads on your bare skin, it would work through a layer
        of clothing. </p>
      <p>And it worked regardless of where you put the two pads! You
        could put one on your shoulder and the other on the sole of your
        foot...and you would still hear whatever program material was
        being played into the neurophone form the hi-fi system. </p>
      <p>I can freely describe this today because (a) I dont think
        Flanagan's patent application ever got accepted and I dont
        believe the patent ever issued. (b) Huyck Corporation is off
        doing its classic thing of making paper machine parts and isnt
        interested in the slightest, and (c) I think the time is just
        about right to get going on this little gadget again. </p>
      <p>Flanagan had succeeded where others had failed. Dr Henry
        Puharich had succeeded in developing a similar device, but the
        pads were one inch copper plates that had to be rubbed along the
        skin to achieve the "fricative effect" to permit Puharich's
        gadget to work. </p>
      <p>In a series of long and complex experiments conducted under my
        supervision at Huyck and by Dr Wayne Batteau at Tuffs, it was
        conclusively shown that the neurophone effect not the result of
        (a) the pads acting as electrostatic loudspeakers, (b) the pads
        exciting bone conduction of the sound, or (c) the pads
        activating the eighth cranial nerve. Although I tried the
        neurophone an a nerve deaf medical doctor at Columbia University
        in 1965, I kept the experiment running for only about ten
        minutes. Dr Wayne Batteau tried it at Tufts and succeed because
        the brain of his nerve deaf subject had "forgotten how to hear"
        and needed something over an hour of application of the
        neurophone signal in order to begin to hear in his brain again!
        We know now that the Flanagan neurophone operated by direct
        linkage of the electronic circuitry with the nervous system
        through electromagnetic fields. We know now that the nervous
        system will pick up any signal and send it to the brain where
        the brain recognizes the signal according to the sensory data it
        represents, then switches the signal to the proper sector of the
        brain responsible for processing such signals. But we dont know
        how Flanagan accidentally happened to crack the neural code for
        audio data. </p>
      <p>I can assure you that the Flanagan neurophone is no hoax. Many
        responsible people experienced it. Just before his death, Dr
        William O. Davis gave me one of the neurophones we had built at
        Huyck; I still have it, but a two hour search through my
        uncatalogued archives of scientific memorabilia and trivia
        failed to locate it this morning. Im going to dig it out and try
        it again for fun. And because it does represent a breakthrough
        that will permit electronic computers to communicate directly to
        our nervous systems...by putting on a beanie, and not plugging a
        cable into a socket implanted on the top of our heads! </p>
      <p>The DARPA work with computers deciphering human EEG signals,
        plus the Flanagan neurophone capable of permitting a computer to
        communicate directly with a human, both make inevitable the
        final computer; the use of the computer as a extension to the
        human brain as an intelligence amplifier for the human being. </p>
      <p>Now, what happened with the Flanagan neurophone, and why havent
        you heard more about it? I am not sure that it is because of the
        reaction of Big Science as discussed by Jerry Pournelle last
        month. There were several factors involved. </p>
      <p>First of all, it didnt look like Huyck could get a patent
        position, so they wanted out. They also discovered that the
        Huyck Corporate Research Laboratories were producing more
        inventions, patents, and potential new products than the company
        could possibly absorb. Huyck also got into production trouble
        with several products that have come along before Corporate
        Research entered the picture. So Huyck dropped the entire
        corporate research program, writing off about 2.5 million spent
        over a five year period. They also convinced themselves that
        they could not afford to develop the marketing know-how for any
        of the new products we were coming up with. They succumbed, as
        have so many other small companies, to the "Harvard Business
        School Syndrome": Dont develop new technology and products
        yourself, but wait until somebody else does and then buy the
        whole schmear, product, production, and marketing know-how in a
        big package. My employment agreement was written in a way that I
        wasnt sure what I could talk about....then. </p>
      <p>Dr. Wayne Batteau suffered a fatal heart attack in Hawaii while
        diving with dolphins. He had also done considerable work in that
        area. </p>
      <p>I dont know where Flanagan is. He worked for NASA in Houston
        for a time in computer programming. The last I knew, he was
        somewhere in California as one of the top experts pyramidology.
        I suspect I will hear from him as a result of this, and Ill
        welcome it. </p>
      <p>Big Science did not kill the neurophone. It was complacent, and
        it really didnt know anything about the device. Academia was not
        really consulted. The neurophone has been dormant for fourteen
        years now because of the failure of nerve and imagination in the
        sales and marketing department. </p>
      <p>But, now, there appears to be a need for the neurophone to take
        the final step toward direct communication between ourselves and
        our crystalline symbiotes/servants, the electronic computers. </p>
      <p>Yes, I am still interested in this area. I am interested in
        anything and everything. But do not-repeat, repeat do not write
        to me or telephone me and ask for free information. I am a
        writer and a consultant, and my business is information...and
        the only thing of real value that you or I have in this world is
        time. I didnt write this soliciting business; I wrote it to
        report to you that the intelligence amplifier is just around the
        corner and awaiting you bright people out there to put it
        together right so that humans stay in control of intelligence
        amplifiers. </p>
      <p>Now, what can we do in the future to integrate the creative
        process of "invention" more fully into the process of research,
        development, production, and marketing? Hang in there......</p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A series of experements were done by muscle testing paitents
        for meridian imbalences and then strengthing the muscle
        indicators, indicating balanced meridians, by running a
        time-domain amplifies signal through the patient's skin. </p>
      <p>The skin is embryonically the source of all special senses. Our
        skin contains more sensors for heat, touch, pain, etc., than any
        other part of the human anatomy. The human ear evolves
        embryonically out of the convolutions of the skin of an embryo
        in the mothers uterus. Basically, the skin is the oldest
        evolutonary nervous system sensor. Another way to look at this,
        is the special sense of tough has progressively extended over
        the entire body by way of skin and evolutionary wise our other
        special senses should follow suit and extend over our entire
        body in time. The skin then, since it is the precursor of the
        ears, should also be capable of hearing, or to put it another
        way, it should beable to transmit the sense of hearing to the
        brain by means other than the 8th Crainial Nerve. </p>
      <p>The skin is both piezo-electric and opto-electric, that is,
        when the skin is stimulated by an electric or photon field, it
        vibrates. If it is mechanically stimulated, it will generate its
        own electric and photon field. In Russia, blind people have been
        trained to "see" with their fingertips and in Czechoslavakia,
        deaf people have been trained to "hear" with their fingertips. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of our experement, we used a Neurophone, a
        device developed by Dr Pat Flanagan, author of the book, <i>Pyramid







          Power</i>. The device uses hyperspacial nested modulation
        technology. Briefly the device takes a complex signal such as
        the sound of an orchestra and electriclly processes it. First,
        the signal is passed into a section which clips everything into
        a series of square waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of
        clipped waves Lisitsyn confirms are the carriers of the human
        brain waves. Next, the square waves are differentiated, since
        these are finite spikes with real non-zero rise times and decay
        times rather than theoretical constructs, a series of noisy
        spikes results the second differentiator section. From here, the
        noisy spikes are introduced to special contact electrodes which
        are placed on the skin. The electrodes are fabricated of
        zirconium titanate imbedded in acrylic plastic tiles to provide
        maximum impedance match to the skin itself. </p>
      <p>In experements done at Tufts University near Boston by Dr
        Dwight Batteau in Man-Dolphin communications and assisted by Dr
        Flanagan, it was established that the nervous system uses time
        ratios as major sources of intelligent information. It was found
        that speech intelligibility was contained in time dominant
        ratios of the speech waveform. Speech quality was found to be
        contained in dominant frequency ratios. So the nervous system is
        designed to recognise two distinct paramaters: the time domain
        and the frequency domain. </p>
      <p>Baised partially upon work done at Tufts University, it is
        known that the human voice does not depend upon frequencies.
        People who have had their larynix removed can use an "artificial
        larynix", a buzz generator held against the side of the throat.
        Word information is formed by the action of the jaw, tongue,
        teeth, glottis, and the nasal cavaties. The human nose and mouth
        form a variable time dely generator. Thus, the basic audio
        information our brains evolved to decipher, the human voice, is
        dependent not upon frequency but upon the time rate of change
        nature of sound caused by time delays imposed by the mouth and
        nasal passages. </p>
      <p>The Neurophone makes use of these research results by
        suppressing the frequency domain and amplifying the time domain
        of the incomming signal. This is one reason why the Neurophone
        sounds so scratchy when one first begins to listen to it. The
        electronic circuitry of the Neurophone presents audio
        information to the skin in the way the skin originally evolved
        to recieve and decode the information eons ago. Thus the
        Neurphone directly inputs information into the brain and nervous
        system, and even the mind, bypassing all the normal sensory
        systems that lie between the mind/brain loop and the outside
        environment. </p>
      <p>Since all of the acupuncture meridians are present on the
        surface of the skin, we found some very interesting affects when
        the skin was activated by the Neurophone. All the subjects of
        the experement were muscle tested fo r one major muscle for each
        of the twelve meridians bilaterally. The meridians were recorded
        as under active for muscle weak in the clear and over active for
        muscles that became weak only by stimulation of the alarm point
        for its respective meridian. The subjects were then connected to
        the Neurophone by placing the electrodes on the skin of the
        forehead just lateral ans superior to the eyes. K-Y Jelly was
        used to enhance the contact between the skin and the electrodes.
        A tape recording of pink noise was then played through the
        Neurophone for a period of two minutes and then the muscles were
        retested after removal of the electrodes. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>Table 1 represents the totals of 10 different paitents who went
        thorugh the experiment. Out of the 240 meridiand tested, 85.8%
        of the unbalanced ones found, were corrected. The Neurophone
        appears to have a beneficial effect on the body. On subesquent
        visits, the meridians were remaining in balance two weeks later.
        Some of the many comments from the paitents included: cessations
        of seizures, inproved sleep, total relaxation, improved
        respiration, better concentration, and cessation of pain. </p>
      <p><b>Additional Research ~</b> </p>
      <p>To be certain the Neurophone was not operating by bone
        conduction, a simple experement was done, known as the Batteau
        test in honor of the hearing research of the late Dr Dwight
        Batteau who developed the test during the Neurophone evaluation
        at Tufts University. </p>
      <p>Two seperate channels of auditory information were used. One
        channel goes through a set of ordinary headphones, the other
        goes through the Neurophone. One specific frequency is played
        through the headphone channel. Another frequency slightly
        different is played through the Neurophone circuitry to the
        transducer disks. If the Neurophone was producing hearing by
        bone conduction, the two slightly different frequencies would
        "mix" in the bone structures of the inner ear, producing a
        discernible "beat frequency" which is the difference between the
        two frequencies. With the Neurophone, this "beat" is heard only
        at very high volume levels in both channels, levels at which the
        Neurophone is probably producing bone conduction by the strong
        vibration of the skin under each transducer disk. However, the
        beat frequency should theoreitcally be heard at all volume
        levels; it is not heard at normal neurophonic listining levels.
      </p>
      <p><b>Looking Ahead ~</b> </p>
      <p>Although the present experement was a relatively simple one,
        the implications of future possibilities are tremendous. The
        following ideas may well serve as topics of future research
        papers and I invite all the members of the I.C.A.K. to pursue
        them, either on their own or in conjunction with me. Some of the
        possibilities for which ther is already some evidence are: </p>
      <p>1. Increase in telepathic awareness. </p>
      <p>2. A brain/mind link between two or more people. T.E. Bearden
        has developed a mathematical formula that indicates that the
        combined mind power of a group of people will multiply
        exponentially if these people are linked in a unitary
        consciousness. </p>
      <p>3. Subliminal learning may be accomplished by the subject
        material being played through the Neurophone at a low volume
        level. No conscious effort is made to learn the material. This
        could even be accomlished while the student is asleep. </p>
      <p>4. Conscious learning may be accomplished by simultaneously
        listening to tape recorded data by means of Neurophone and
        headphones. In this way, the learning centers of the brain are
        being accessed by at least two seperate channels. </p>
      <p>5. Positive subliminal programs to alter undesirable habits:
        i.e., weight control, smoking control, and creation of positive
        mental attitude. </p>
      <p>6. Control the aging process by means of positive cellular
        programming via the Neurophone. </p>
      <p>7. Totally deaf people being able to the recorded audio.</p>

        Definitions: CRT = Critical Reaction Time </p>
      <p>In a purely rate of onset pulse information system, the pulse
        rate of the system and the pulse amplitude of the system would
        remain the same. The things which will be varied, are the slope
        of the leading edge of the pulse, and inversely the width. </p>
      <p>In this system, the amplitude,(e) of the pulse remains the
        same; so does the repeition rate of the signal. The only things
        to be changed are the slope and thus the width of the top of the
        pulse. From now on, the slope in degrees will be represented by
        (à), and the width at the top will be represented by (T). We can
        then formulate an empirical formula for the relationship of à to
        T. (T measured in usec). T = K/à as à = 45 degrees, T = 0 or T =
        max time, à = 0 degrees. K = conversion factor. </p>
      <p>Therefore T also equals I (instantaneous audio information). </p>
      <p>The width of the entering pulse with no information must be
        equal to the CRT of the nervous system at any given instance.
        Then the slope of the pulse and thus the width at the top are
        varied, so is the response of the system. A pulse of the same
        amplitude but of the wrong width for the CRT of the neuron will
        only partially load the neuron. The amount or amplitude of the
        loaded signal in the neuron will be proportional to the width of
        the pulse as it is varied. </p>
      <p>Now, if a sine wave is loaded into the system, the frequency of
        the wave must be varied so that the width of the wave will
        coincide with the varying CRT of the loaded system, otherwise
        the sine wave will have no effect on the neuron, i.e., very
        little. </p>
      <p>It has been shown by my experimentation with the effects of
        adrenergia and cholinergia on the nervous system, that as the
        body goes into the state of adrenergia, the frequency of the
        carrier must be increased to meet the smaller CRT of the nerves
        introduced by the addition of adrenaline and acetylcholine into
        the system. And, as the body goes into a state of colinergia,
        the opposite is true, the frequency must be lowered, due to the
        increased CRT. Otherwise no information can be transmitted into
        the system. </p>
      <p>In adrenergia, the excited state, the K ion mobility is
        increased and the CRT is smaller....thus requiring a higher
        frequency. In the case of cholinergia, the opposite is true. </p>
      <p>Lets now analyze a 30 KHZ sine wave as applied to the nervous
        system and see what the nervous system sees. The sine wave is
        clipped at e and the width of the top of the clipped wave is
        &lt; 15 usec. Now, if the nervous system at this instant has a
        CRT of approx 15 usec perfect loading will occur. </p>
      <p>Now, if the CRT of the nervous system at this moment should
        change to 20 usec, the carrier would have to be shifted to 25
        KHz to obtain the same response. This increase in CRT would
        indicate that the person had gone into a state of colinergia.
        The new CRT of the neuron would now cause the neuron to be
        improperly loaded at 30 KHZ, but properly loaded at 25 KHz. </p>
      <p>Now we will look and see what the effects of modulated and
        unmodulated carrier have on the system at the neurons CRT.
        According to the Encylopedia Britannica, the output frequency
        generated by a neuron is proportional to the amplitude of the
        stimulus, until the stimulus reaches a certain level and the
        frequency then remains the same is.. the clipping level of the
        system. The completely loaded neuron will then be receiving
        maximum stimulus and will then be generating a frequency of its
        own in proportion to the loaded voltage. At this loading in the
        unmodulated carrier, a series of meaningless pulses are being
        generated and sent to the brain where they are probably rejected
        and passed off as random noise. </p>
      <p>Now let us look at a tone modulated carrier (AM Signal) and see
        what happens with some information input. The pulse width at the
        top (clipping) now varies with change in carrier amplitude at
        the audio tone modulation frequency. The loading voltage of the
        neuron will now vary with the audio rate....the varying width of
        the top of the pulse now follows a pattern of widths in time
        with the audio tone. </p>
      <p>The overall process: (Audio) I = varies T and which vary e
        loading in neuron which generates freq to the brain. We now have
        a system that detects and interprets rate of change into the
        neuron's own coding system. Or, as applied to a purely rate of
        onset modulation system with a pulse input instead of a sine
        wave input. We now have a coded conversion system for
        introducing information into the nervous system. </p>

      </p>
      <p>This year the neurophone concept has now reached maturity. It
        was developed 21 years ago this year (1979). The entire history
        of the neurophone reads like a James Bond mystery novel. We are
        currently writing a full length book on the neurophone story,
        and expect to publish this next year. For the present, we will
        give you a synopsis of the neurophone story, and bring the
        reader up to date on the current development of the neurophone
        Mk XI, the eleventh model in a long chain of discovery.
        following the basic history of the neurophone, we will give
        instructions for the set up and use of the neurophone. </p>
      <p>The first neurophone was developed when I was 14 years old. A
        brief description of the original device is given in the book
        PYRAMID POWER. The original neurophone patent #3,393,279,
        describes a high voltage, high frequency, amplitude modulated
        radio oscillator. This device made the listener into a radio
        receiver. It transmitted sound information to the user by means
        of small insulated electrodes. The 3000 volt signal produced an
        electric field of extremely low power density. As the carrier
        frequency was in the vicinity of 50 Khz, and the capacitance of
        the electrodes was therefore extremely low. The above electrical
        conditions of low power density indicate that the original
        device was safe for use. However, if the electrode surfaces were
        scratched, the user would experience a mild, but annoying mild
        electric shock. </p>
      <p>When I originally received the idea for the first neurophone, I
        was a child of 14, and did not have funds to hire a patent
        attorney. One of my fathers friends was a patent attorney for
        Shell Development Corporation, and agreed to help me write my
        own application. Over the years, I became very familiar with
        patent law, as the patent examiner in Washington said the
        neurophone could not possibly work, as it defied ALL present
        laws of neurophysiology. The patent fight over the neurophone
        went on for many years, finally resulting in complete rejection
        by the examiner, closing the file forever with no recourse. </p>
      <p>In a brilliant move, my patent attorney (I could afford one by
        now) suggested that we go to Washington and demonstrate the
        neurophone to the examiner in a final attempt to gain approval.
        When we arrived at the patent office, the examiner had a real
        surprise waiting for us, he had arranged for a deaf employee of
        the patent office to be present for the demonstration! The deaf
        gentleman was nerve deaf in one ear, and almost totally deaf in
        the other ear. When the deaf employee heard high frequency
        sounds for the first time in 15 years, he wept for joy. The
        examiner then reopened the neurophone file, and issued the
        patent giving the original filing date. </p>
      <p>By the time the patent was actually issued, a company in New
        York owned by Joseph Lawrence, and Andreja Puharich was
        infringing on my patent. It seems that they had applied for a
        similar patent several months after I had applied for mine. As I
        was the first to file, and had pursued the patent, I won the
        device. The small New York company bought the patent, and by
        means of legal maneuvers, succeeded in causing me to lose a
        small fortune in the process. This was due to their issuance of
        lettered stock which tumbled to a fraction of its original value
        by the time the SEC allowed me to sell it. </p>
      <p>We have actually gone far ahead of our story, so we will
        backtrack a little. during the years in which I battled the
        patent office for the original patent many events took place.
        When I was 17 years old, LIFE magazine called and wanted to do
        an article on the device. When I was 14, I had received national
        publicity on the front pages of 300 newspapers. After the LIFE
        article came out, I was offered up to $8,000,000 for the patent
        rights. The press coverage was unbelievable. The Ive Got a
        Secret show(Gary Moore) invited me to New York, and millions of
        people saw the neurophone demonstrated on Bess Meyerson. It was
        during this show, when I first met Puharich and Lawrence. </p>
      <p>Puharich invited me to lunch at the Twenty One club, along with
        G. Harry Stine, a scientist under the employ of a firm in
        Connecticut known as Huyck Corporation. Stine's company was
        interested in the rights to the neurophone. </p>
      <p>When all the offers were in, my parents and my Houston attorney
        agreed that the neurophone should be given to Huyck. After
        examining the device for two years, Huyck said the device could
        not be patented, and dropped it into my hands once again. By
        this time, I was under extreme pressure, as I was once again
        given the task of pursuing the patent on my own limited funds.
        At the same time, Puharich and Lawrence kept urging me to give
        up, saying that they had me beat in the patent office. </p>
      <p>In 1964, I was offered a position at Tufts University near
        Boston. Dr. Dwight Wayne Batteau, a professor at Tufts had an
        intense interest in the neurophone as it might play a role in
        man dolphin communications. Dr. Batteau had a small company
        known as Listening Inc., along with a brilliant electronics man:
        Steve Moshier. Listening had extensive contracts with the ONR
        (Office of Naval Research), and was subcontracting Tufts in some
        of its research and development work. </p>
      <p>Our first task was to establish the limits and parameters of
        the neurophone as it would apply to dolphins. Our secondary task
        was to determine the physiological mechanism by which the device
        worked. </p>
      <p>Dolphins have extremely large brains, and communicate on many
        levels. We considered that the neurophone would open a channel
        to the dolphin which was not previously accessible. </p>
      <p>In our initial testing, we found that the neurophone produced a
        minute mechanical vibration in the skin under the electrodes.
        When one person was listening to the device, other people
        standing near the electrodes could hear the sounds coming from
        the skin. If a stethoscope was placed in contact with the users
        skin, the vibration could be heard loudly, and clearly. Our
        initial effort was to determine if this vibration was producing
        bone conduction, or was the skin vibration merely an artifact? </p>
      <p>Doctor Batteau came up with an ingenious experiment to
        determine if the skin vibration was actually leading to bone
        conduction: If the neurophone were a separate acoustic channel
        into the brain, we should be able to play two discordant sounds
        into the brain of an ordinary person, one by neurophone, and one
        by earphones through the ears. If bone conduction were involved,
        the sounds would mix or beat in the bone structures of the inner
        ear, producing a discord. In the process of bone conduction,
        sounds are transmitted through bony skeletal structures to the
        inner ear, where the small bones normally vibrated by the ear
        drum are activated by skeletal vibration. This vibration is then
        encoded by the inner ear, and transmitted to the brain by means
        of the 8th cranial nerve. We are sure that the neurophone did
        make use of another channel, due to the fact that people with
        8th cranial nerve damage had heard with the device. </p>
      <p>In our experiment, we played one frequency of sound into the
        neurophone, and another frequency into the headphones through
        the ears. If bone conduction were involved, the sounds would mix
        as predicted in the inner ear, and a discord would be perceived
        by the test subjects (Tufts psychology students). If the channel
        to the brain were a separate one, the signals would be heard
        simultaneously with no discord. At low volume levels, the
        students were able to perceive the separate sounds with no
        mixing. At higher volume levels, a mixing could be heard. </p>
      <p>We then ran the same experiment by playing the sounds through
        stereo headphones, with each signal going into separate ears.
        The results were exactly the same as the neurophone experiment.
        At low volume levels, the signals were indeed perceived apart
        from each other. At higher volume levels, the discord could be
        perceived. </p>
      <p>The higher volume discordant mixing can be explained by neural
        intermodulation possibly taking place in the corpus collosum,
        the small nerve bundle which connects the left and right
        hemispheres of the brain together. We tested a number of Tufts
        students, and they all had identical results. Wayne Batteau was
        so excited, that he suggested we write a letter to Science, for
        publication. Our letter is duplicated in the appendix. </p>
      <p>As the neurophone was now proven to be a separate brain
        communication channel, Doctor Batteau made an offer for rights
        to the device. He offered to give me a 1/3 interest in
        Listening, a 5% royalty, and position of Vice President in
        charge of research. The idea was to develop the neurophones
        potential in many areas, including its potential as an interface
        (electronic corpus collosum) between man and dolphin, and play
        EEG signals from a human brain into the dolphin; and to reverse
        the procedure. </p>
      <p>Our work was progressing at a satisfactory rate, when tragedy
        struck Listening. Wayne Batteau died of a heart attack in
        shallow water while swimming near our dolphin facility on Oahu,
        Hawaii. When he died, the Navy canceled our contracts and
        Listening began to fold. Shortly after that, we demonstrated the
        neurophone to the patent examiner, and the rest is history. </p>
      <p>While investigating man dolphin communications, we succeeded in
        developing a language translator, a device that translated human
        speech into dolphin language, and vic versa. This development
        required a thorough understanding of the nature of speech, and
        information theory. We made many efforts to model the nervous
        system, and succeeded in demonstrating that the nervous system
        uses time ratios as major sources of intelligent information. We
        then began to investigate timing ratios in speech patterns of
        humans and dolphins. During that period, we found that speech
        intelligibility was contained in time dominant ratios in the
        speech waveform. We found that speech quality was contained in
        dominant frequency ratios. So, the nervous system is designed to
        recognize two distinct parameters: the time domain, and the
        frequency domain. </p>
      <p>As a result of the knowledge gained in this area, I designed a
        circuit which suppressed the frequency domain, while amplifying
        the time domain. This device, was so radical in approach, that I
        applied for a patent on it as a specialized speech processor.
        Six months after the patent was applied for, the National
        Security Agency placed the patent application under a top
        secrecy order #756,124. The order said that my invention was
        being suppressed in the interest of National Security. It
        further stated that I could be tried for treason and shot by
        firing squad if I revealed its working nature to anyone other
        than an authorized government representative. In other words
        they stole it! Needless to say I was very disappointed in the
        system. It took four year, and three law firms to sue for
        release of my invention. We won the battle, and the secrecy
        order was rescinded. Patent #3,647,970 was issued on the 7th of
        March 1972. </p>
      <p>In 1974, two years after I wrote Pyramid Power, we spent the
        night in the Great Pyramid. A full description of that event
        will have to wait for the publication of our full length book on
        the neurophone.(see also "Gods of Aquarius" by Brad Stieger a
        starseed book) I can say that I had an experience of
        enlightenment, including a full blown Kundalini Release. After
        that experience, I became a trance medium. During one of my
        trances, the message came through that the speech processing
        patent which was under secrecy so long was in actuality the
        perfect neurophone circuit. Well, this was a surprise, as I had
        never tried the circuit in that way. I must admit, I really did
        not believe it could work as a neurophone. The message to try
        the speech processor as a neurophone kept coming and coming
        until I finally decided to try it out. When I tried it, I was in
        the suprise of my life! It worked! The result was the
        development of the present neurophone Mk XI, the finest
        neurophone to date, and it does not require the use of a radio
        frequency carrier wave. </p>
      <p>The clue as to how the neurophone actually works, is contained
        in the skin vibration artifact which we discovered at Tufts
        University. The original neurophone used a high voltage
        amplitude modulated carrier wave to create a molecular vibration
        in the skin itself. The skin became the diaphragm of a
        biological electrostatic vibrator. The skin is piezo electric
        and opto-electric. That is, when the skin is stimulated by an
        electric field, or by a photon field, it will contract and
        vibrate with modulation of the field. If it is mechanically
        stimulated, it will generate its own electric field. In Russia,
        blind people have been trained to see with their fingertips; and
        in Czechoslavakia, deaf people have been trained to hear with
        their fingertips. </p>
      <p>The skin is the largest most complex organ of the living
        system. As we develop in the womb, all organs of sense evolve
        from the skin. The skin involutes and convolutes to form eyes,
        ears, etc. Our research indicates that the skin itself has the
        latent potential of performing all functions of perception. </p>
      <p>The neurophone stimulates and develops this latent ability. The
        skin is the organ which receives the signal from the neurophone,
        and converts the incoming signal into a modulated molecular
        vibration which is then interpreted as sound. We could
        theoretically stimulate the sense of sight in a similar way. As
        all acupuncture meridians are present on the surface of the
        skin, we have found that the neurophone stimulation balances all
        the acupuncture meridians by activating the skin! </p>
      <p>The neurophone Mk XI converts incoming non-linear acoustic
        information into a time domain amplified signal. This signal is
        then transmitted to a pair of high dielectric constant ceramic
        electrodes which are placed in contact with the skin of the
        head. The electric field (approx 20 Volts RMS) interacts with
        the skin ceramic electrode combination to create a molecular
        vibration in the skin. This is then interpreted by the brain.
        The result is a new modality for coupling information to the
        brain, using the skin itself as the receptor. Bone conduction
        vibrators will not work as a neurophone, as the vibratory signal
        is to gross, the skin itself must vibrate in a synchronous mode
        in accordance with the time encoded information. </p>
      <p>Doctor Christopher Hills, in his book Nuclear Evolution states
        that the skin is a second brain, and is the basic organ of
        spiritual and psychic evolution. He states that the skin can be
        trained to develop powers of perception such as telepathy,
        etc... </p>
      <p>The neural information processing system of the human body is
        apparently extremely sensitive to time domain information.
        Doctor Batteau postulated that the nervous system incorporates
        delay line correlation technology to detect time varied
        information ratios. The neurophone Mk XI processing circuit
        processes the incoming complex non linear signal waveform, and
        amplifies the non linearities thus increasing the timing
        recognition pattern of the signal. In the process, the frequency
        domain is suppressed. The time rate of change of the incoming
        signal is thus amplified. This signal is so time dominant, that
        it can be hard clipped or run through a zero crossing detector
        without losing any intelligibility. </p>
      <p>This time processed signal is then fed to the pair of high
        dielectric ceramic electrodes. The 20 volt average RMS signal
        does not require a radio carrier to work. As stated earlier, the
        original neurophone design had to actually work by brute force,
        due to the fact that the modulation signal was not processed to
        increase the time domain signal properties. As previously
        stated, the original neurophone produced typical voltages on the
        order of 3000 at a carrier frequency of 50000 hertz. As the skin
        is piezoelectric, and has a dielectric constant in the range of
        12000, the neurophone electrodes are made of a ceramic material
        designed to provide a maximum impedance match to the skin
        itself. The entire skin electrode system is a piezoelectric
        resonator. Note: The ceramic electrodes are fragile and could
        break if dropped on a hard surface. Be very careful, they are
        expensive to replace. </p>
      <p>To obtain the best results from your neurophone experience, you
        should spend at least 1/2 hour per day listening to a broad
        spectrum frequency source in a quiet, relaxing environment. It
        is best to listen with an increased blood flow to the brain. The
        preferred position is an inclined plane of 11 degrees with the
        head down. Testing has shown that most people go into deep alpha
        within 30 seconds when placed in this position. This state is
        the most receptive state to listen to the neurophone. The
        neurophone listener can build his own incline plane from a board
        six feet long, and at least 18 inches wide. The raised end of
        the board should be supported at a level of 14 inches above the
        floor. </p>
      <p>The electrodes should be placed on the temples, directly behind
        and slightly above the eyes. Do not place on the hair. Although
        the electrodes will work perfectly well without electrode jelly,
        we suggest the use of EEG type electrode jelly, or KY jelly, as
        this improves impedance matching to the skin. If you use KY
        jelly as an electrode cream, smear an even coating over the
        black ceramic of each electrode, and place the electrodes in
        contact with the skin. The electrodes may be held in place by
        means of an EEG type rubber strap, or an ordinary 2 inch ACE
        bandage may be used. </p>
      <p>After the electrode strap is in position on the head, insert
        the KY coated ceramic electrodes under the strap so the
        electrodes are held securely in contact with the temples. Later,
        you may desire to move the electrodes around to experience
        different sensations. Many neurophone listeners prefer to place
        one electrode in the center of the forehead, on the 3rd eye
        area, and to place the other one on the back of the neck, or on
        the hand or wrist. </p>
      <p>The sound source for neurophone listening can be a cassette
        player, a radio, or a stereo HI Fi system. The neurophone should
        be driven from a headphone or a speaker output jack. Your
        neurophone is provided with an audio connector cable with a mini
        plug on the cassette end, and a 1/4 inch phone plug on the other
        end. This will fit most cassette players. If you want to drive
        the neurophone from another source you may have to obtain a
        different wire. Your local Radio Shack store will probably have
        the right one. </p>
      <p>In using the neurophone, I generally adjust the sound level of
        the cassette machine to a comfortable listening level as heard
        through the built in loudspeaker of the machine. I then plug the
        mini plug into the earphone jack of the player, and plug the
        standard phone plug into the input jack on the neurophone. Plug
        the electrode phone plug into the neurophone output jack. Rotate
        the neurophone volume control slowly clockwise. The switch on
        the control will turn the unit on. The small LED panel lamp
        should glow at this time. Slowly turn the control up until you
        begin to hear the tape from your cassette player through the
        neurophone electrodes. Depending on the program material to
        which you are listening, the sound which you first hear through
        the neurophone will not sound like Hi Fi. This is due to two
        things: The sound you hear is time domain dominant. 2. As this
        is a new listening channel, the brain actually has missing
        processing capability. If we run a frequency sweep of the
        neurophone while listening, we will find that all of us have
        certain spectra which are entirely missing from our perceptual
        ability. That is, in the beginning we may hear a complex sound
        wave of one millisecond duration (1KHz), but miss entirely a
        sound of another domain. As we listen through the neurophone,
        the missing ranges are programmed into the brain. After
        listening for as little as 30 minutes, the sound begins to take
        on new qualities. The sound appears to move around in the head,
        and take on new dimension as we program our psychic brain
        centers to receive the new signal input. The more the neurophone
        is used, the clearer it gets. I recommend electronic music tapes
        in the beginning, such as the astral sound tape. </p>
      <p>As the neurophone channel is but one channel into the brain, we
        have found that supplementing the neurophone channel with the
        frequency domain input by means of quality headphones is
        desirable. The reintroduction of the frequency domain through
        the headphones adds a new dimension of sound to the brain mind
        input system. The combination of neurophone plus headphone
        signals provides the best listening combination. For this
        purpose, the neurophone contains a headphone output jack which
        will accept monaural or stereo headphones. The second volume
        control from the left is used to control sound to the
        headphones. As the headphones are driven by the cassette
        recorder, the neurophone must be plugged into a speaker or
        headphone output jack. The neurophone plus headphone adjustment
        should be made as follows: 1. First adjust the sound level to
        the electrodes with the headphone control in the off position.
        2. With the headphones in place, slowly adjust the level of the
        headphones to supplement the electrode signal. Sit back, or lay
        back close your eyes and let the signals carry you away. </p>
      <p>In the near future: Source of Innergy will begin to produce
        cassette tapes designed to be used only with the neurophone. The
        tapes will cover many different categories from: Psychic Center
        Stimulation; to Subliminal Habit Modification Programs. We will
        notify neurophone owners as these tapes become available for
        purchase. </p>
      <p>In the beginning, it is not necessary to use special tapes, as
        the object is to develop the latent channel through which the
        neurophone works. This may be done by listening to white noise
        (waterfalls) or your favorite music tapes. Neurophone stimulated
        perceptual enhancement occurs with increasing frequency as you
        use your neurophone. This experience is similar to the
        meditation experience of transcending. These periods of
        extremely clarity become more and more pronounced as you put
        hours on your neurophone. All changes in awareness are not
        gradual. All progress is in the form of discrete steps. What may
        appear to be a gradual altering of consciousness is actually a
        series of graduations. We may plod along thinking we are making
        no forward progress, and at the point in time where we feel we
        want to give up we experience quantum leap in awareness. One of
        the most common awareness changes with the neurophone effect is
        an increase in telepathic awareness. Although this cannot be
        turned on at will, instances of its occurrence will increase in
        frequency as time goes on. Please keep a diary of neurophone
        hours of listening, and make note of any change in awareness,
        dreaming, or unusual perception changes. </p>
      <p>We would like all neurophone owners to send us a monthly
        research report or diary of experiences. This is important data
        which will enable us to share with you all experiences, and tune
        the neurophone experience. Keep note of your actual listening
        time, and listening material. If you experience any change in
        consciousness or awareness record this down. Others would like
        to share your experience. </p>
      <p>Retired Lt. Col. Thomas Bearden is a nuclear physicist from
        George Washington University. He is one of the foremost experts
        in warfare strategy, and is an expert in the field of Soviet
        Psychotronics Research. Tom Bearden and I have made two mind
        links by means of the neurophone. Details of the brain mind link
        will be given in a later edition of the Innergy News, or the
        neurophone research journal. Col Bearden has developed a
        mathematical formula that indicates that the combined mind power
        of a group of people will multiply exponentially if these people
        are linked in a unitary consciousness. A small group of people
        could actually alter the entire course of mankind in an instant
        of time, if they were perfectly linked in a unified field of
        consciousness. Col Bearden believes that the neurophone is the
        key to linking consciousness. He believes it may hold the answer
        to solving all the problems of mankind. </p>
      <p>This linking could be done in a number of ways. The Soviets
        have established that an EEG machine of only 16 channels could
        pick up the entire consciousness of an individual. All that is
        then necessary, is to feed the data into the mind of another by
        means of a multi channel neurophone. The neurophone would then
        become an electronic corpus collosum between the minds of two or
        more people. </p>
      <p>At a given time in the near future, we will notify all
        neurophone owners to all try to listen to the neurophone at an
        exact time period everyday. This will be a simple attempt to
        unify the consciousness of the group. This type of experiment
        has been somewhat successful in the past, when used with group
        meditation. It may be that this experiment will speed up the
        increased awareness brought about by the use of the neurophone.

      <p>1. A step up audio transformer was attached to a hi-fi
        amplifier. The output voltage of the audio transformer was about
        1,500 volts peak to peak. The perceived sound quality was very
        poor,highly distorted and very weak. The signal was perceived as
        being loudest and clearest when the amplifier was over driven
        and clipped square waves were being generated. The O'scope
        signal had ringing spikes or oscillations of a dampened wave at
        frequencies of 40 to 50kHz. (Flanagan, <i>Life Magazine </i>14
        Sep 1962) </p>
      <p>2. An amplitude-modulated signal was then fed into a high
        frequency transformer that was flat in frequency response for an
        adjustable frequency in the 20-100kHz range. The output was a
        2,000 volt peak to peak amplitude modulated carrier wave.
        (Flanagan Patent No. 3,393,279 (1968) </p>
      <p>3. The audio signal is pulse width modulated on to a 50KHZ
        square wave carrier. Output is stepped up to a 50 volt square
        wave. This signal is applied to the body by means of piezo
        ceramic disks.(lead zirconium titanate) (Flanagan Patent No.
        3,647,970 (1972) </p>
      <p>4. The audio signal is pulse width modulated on to a 45KHZ
        square wave carrier then double differentiated(processed thru 2
        differentiator circuits). Output is stepped up to a 60 volts
        RMS. This signal is applied to the body by means of piezo
        ceramic disks (Radio Shack Type)(Brass side to skin, red leads
        connected to circuit).(Info obtained from various researchers) </p>
      <p>5. The audio signal is differentiated and passed into a section
        that clips everything into a series of square waves and then
        converted to 40 volt pulses which is then run through a zero
        crossing detector (comparator).The sensor electrodes are one
        inch diameter plates made from lead zirconium titanate
        (piezoelectric discs). (Extrema, US Patent No. 4,545,065) </p>
      <p>6. Audio signal is modulated on to a 100KHZ carrier and power
        amplified then sent to an antenna. Those near the antenna
        percieves the sound if like thru earphones while those further
        away hear nothing, no contact with the antenna is made.(approx

      <p>7.&nbsp; Another unit is based upon a miniaturized hi-power
        amplifier amplifying the audio information directly, no square
        waves or carrirers are used. The sensors are piezo-electric
        transducers on ceramic bases. Good quality sound (not quite high
        fidelity headphone sound) is experenced coming from the middle
        of your brain, more or less.(www.throne.com)(GROC BOX(R)) </p>
      <p>How to use nuro devices: </p>
      <p>1. Connect the brass electrode plates (or bare ceramic) ideally
        to a point above the shoulders. The sides of the neck or about
        1-2 cm out on the face from the center line of the ears are good
        locations. </p>
      <p>2. Adjust the sound input device (stereo tape player or CD
        player) volume to its lowest setting and then increase the
        volume until it reaches the maximum volume possible without
        creating any sensation at the point of electrode contact. You
        should hear an external sound emanating from the location of the
        electrodes. This is normal. </p>
      <p>3. Using ear plugs, close off the exterior ears during the
        first week of use. This gives you time to turn your brains
        attention to the interior sound. </p>
      <p>4. For the initial week of use it is advised to use music with
        a wide band of frequency. Classical string instruments with the
        full range of orchestal sounds work well. Use the device one or
        more hours a day. </p>
      <p>5. After the first week of use switch to whatever learning
        tapes you wish to use. It is recommended that you use an auto
        reversing tape player and use it one or more hours per day. </p>

      <p>The very young man above is standing on his head because he
        says it helps him think. It evidently does. Pat Flanagan, a 17
        year old inventor from Bellaire, Texas, is already nipping at
        the heels of the venerable 30 and 40 year old scientist and
        inventors who built the remarkable structures seen on pages 54
        to 65. Pat has just perfected a remarkable machine of his own
        which one day may help deaf people hear and blind people see. It
        may also earn him a million dollars. Pat treats his imminent
        collision with success with equanimity, for he reckons and who
        is to gain say him nowadays that the generation which will take
        over from the take over generation will find nothing is
        impossible. </p>
      <p>Pat Flanagan is a unique and self spurred teenage boy who has
        forged his mind and body into the model of a mature and
        inquisitive scientist. At the same time he reflects the more
        standard teenage model; he is the twist champion of Bellaire a
        suburb of Houston a moderate party goer and girl chaiser, the
        holder of a private pilots licence, and a spectacular gymnast.
        espite his ability to function in two worlds, Pat leaves no
        doubt which one he favors. There are far too many kids my age
        who are willing to just get along. Pat is confident in his
        ability to do alot more than just get along. </p>
      <p>His single minded belief in his abilities began with a
        compelling dream he had when he was 8 years old. In the dream I
        was told I had to learn all about physics and electronics, he
        says. And it told me I should help people. Already an athletic
        boy able to do 300 pushups a day, he thereupon set out to
        improve his mind. By the time he was 13 he was repairing
        television sets during summer vacations, trying to earn money to
        build an electronic laboratory in his attic. </p>
      <p>Pat's restless imagination drove him to tireless sessions in
        his laboratory. To abet them he solicited a rare favor from his
        parents and his older brother Mike the privilage to experiment
        there undisturbed. One weekend last October, Pat started the
        experiment which led to the development of his particular
        fantastic machine. Starting with a radio transmitter he had
        designed himself, he tried modulating its waves to see if he
        could induce hearing in his nervous systemwithout going through
        the normal channels of hearing. He hooked his radio to a small
        transmitter which looked like an earmuff. After 34 hours of
        work, he stopped up his ears, put the earmuff to his head and
        found he still could hear. </p>
      <p>I ran downstairs to tell somebody anybody. I woke my mom. She
        just rolled over and said to me, thats nice, Pat, but Ill listen
        to it in the morning. She did listen in the morning and alot of
        very important people have been listening to Pat ever since. </p>
      <p>Pat calls his device the neurophone and the process it operates
        by neuroception. Essentially what it does, he thinks, is
        transmit electrical messages identical to those sounds generate
        through the bodys nervous system direct to the brain. Hence he
        can place the neurophones earmuff on someone's spine or solar
        plexus, plug up his subjects ears, and the person will still
        hear. Obviously if the neurophone in fact does what it seems to
        do, Pat has come a long way twoard short circuiting the bodys
        ordinary sensory processes and giving man, unprecedented access
        to his brain. Other inventors many with a lot more experience
        and facilities than Pat have been seeking such a device for
        years, and Pat explains his success verses their failure as a
        product of his own vigorous one man approach to science. I
        believe research in the problem of electronic hearing has been
        limited because inventors havent been able to use human subjets
        as guinea pigs. An animal cant tell you just what 'he heard or
        how clearly he heard it. But I was my own gunea pig and I wasnt
        restricted by the possibile bad effects, and I got the secret. </p>
      <p>There is some question as to just what Pat has got even he has
        no firm knowledge of why his neurophone works but no question
        whatever that somehow he has onto something valuable. Several
        comanies have expressed interest in buying the rights to the
        neurophone and one Corpus Cristi firm has tentatively offered
        him a million dollars if the machine can be adapted to send
        visual images into the brains of blind people. Dr. William O.
        Davis of Stamford, Conn Hyuck Corporation, a research and
        development company which is also fascinated by the neurophone
        says, The ability to detect radio signals in the brain is a
        remarkable phenomenon. If we never learn more about Pat's
        invention, even if we never learn why it works, it certainly is
        a utilitarian breakthru which could help a number of people.
        Davis, who used to run the Air Forces basic research program,
        adds, its important to realize that young Flanagan had the
        necessary intuition to invent his neurophone. You make
        discoveries intuitively, in the same manner you would paint a
        picture or write a symphony. </p>
      <p>Pat wants to go on to college, but he is worried about
        fettering his talent: I seek the knowledge college will provide,
        but I never want to be just satisfied with what someone else has
        written and done. He hopes, as his skills increase, to probe
        other recesses of mens mind. I believe someday the entire
        concept of medical pratice will be changed by electronics, he
        says. People will be treated electronically rather than with
        medicine. If God can make the earth and sky and the force that
        people and trees live, then inventing anything less than this
        should be relatively simple. </p>
      <p>Statements like this one tend to prove a bit abrasive to Pat's
        classmates. Pats a wise guy, plenty cocky, and sure of himself,
        one says, but the bad part of it is hes just that much better at
        anything he sets his mind to do. </p>
      <p>Pat claims this reaction does not bother him I want to be
        accepted, sure, but some people were cutout to go full tilt.
        Pats hands and mind are always going full tilt of late. The
        books strewn across his cluttred attic laboratory range from Zen
        to Karate to electronic jurnals to the Hidden Persuaders. Lights
        glow from a wave testing machine and he is working on a new way
        of tuning TV sets. </p>
      <p>People think Ive accomplished so much in life, he says. They
        say what else can you do , and all that stuff. But I know where
        Im going and I know what I have to do. When I die I want to
        leave behind something which will greatly affect and help
        everyone. </p>

        <br>
        <b><font size="+1">Principles of Operation</font></b></center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>The Thinkman is the latest development in the series of
        neurophone devices first invented by Patrick Flanagan in 1959
        when he was a prolific young inventor of 14. Since that time,
        considerable progress has been made in the development of
        improved neurophone devices, and the thinkman is the fiftieth
        neurophone system developed by Dr. Flanagan. A full and complete
        theory of the neurological, physiological and psychological
        operation of the neurophone is still being pieced together. </p>
      <p>How does it work? How is it possible to hear without using ones
        ears? The current hypothesis is based upon the fact that the
        skin is embrionically the source of all our human sense organs.
        In fact, the skin itself contains more sensors, for heat, touch,
        pain, etc., than any other part of the human anatomy. The human
        ear evolves embryonically out of the convolutions of the skin of
        an embryo in the mothers womb. Basically, the skin is the oldest
        evolutionary nervous system sensor. Since it is the precursor of
        the ears, the skin should also be capable of hearing and, as the
        neurophone proves, the skin does indeed have this capability. </p>
      <p>Neurologically, the human skin is both piezoelectric and
        optoelectric. This means that it produces minute electrical
        currents when vibrated or rubbed. Soviet and Czechoslovakian
        neurological research has also shown that the skin produces an
        electric current when stimulated by light. </p>
      <p>As long ago as 1785, Charles Augustin DeCoulomb, a french
        physicist and an early experimenter with electricity, proved
        that an electrostatic field produces a measurable physical
        force. The neurophone processes audio information to produce a
        very weak 20 volt RMS electric field at each of its two
        transducer disks. This alternating electric field is changed as
        a function of the time rate of change of the audio signal coming
        into the neurophone. This minute electrical field actually
        causes microscopic vibrations of the skin under the transducer
        disks. Maximum coupling of the electric field to the skin is
        ensured by fabricating the transducer disks from Zirconium
        Titanate which possess the same dielectric constant as human
        skin. If you were to put an ordinary medical stethoscope on the
        skin next to one of the transducer disks while the neurophone is
        being used, you would be able to detect the vibrations of the
        skin created by the tiny electric field of the transducer disk.
      </p>
      <p>Work done by Dr's Patrick Flanagan and Dwight Wayne Batteau at
        Tufts University during the years of 1964-1968 is the basis of
        the current theory regarding how the neurophone works. They
        discovered that the frequency content of the human voice had
        little to do with the brain's ability to recognize intelligence
        in human speech. For example, people who have had their larynx
        removed can use an artificial larynx, a buzz generator or low
        frequency vibrator held against the side of the throat. Words
        are formed totally by the action of the jaw, the tongue, the
        teeth, the glottis, and the nasal cavities. These cavities form
        a highly variable time delay encoding chamber. They found that
        the basic audio information which our brains evolved to
        decipher, the human voice, is dependent not upon frequency but
        upon the time rate of change nature of a sound caused by time
        delays imposed by the mouth and nasal passages. The neurophone
        makes use of these time delay codes by processing the incoming
        audio signal to remove the frequency component and leave only
        the time domain, the time rate of change information. This is
        one reason why the neurophone sounds so scratchy when one first
        begins to listen to it. Thus, the electronic circuitry presents
        audio information to the skin in the manner that the skin was
        originally designed to receive and decode such information eons
        ago. </p>
      <p>But is it certain that the neurophone is not operating by bone
        conduction as are some other devices available today for
        listening experiments and enjoyment? A definitive experiment
        proving that bone conduction is not a cause of neurophonic
        hearing can be duplicated by anyone with the required simple
        equipment. This procedure is called the Batteau test, honoring
        the late hearing researcher, Dr Dwight Wayne Batteau, who
        developed the test during neurophone evaluation at Tufts
        University. Two separate channels of audio information are
        required. One channel goes through a set of ordinary headphones,
        the other goes through the neurophone. One specific frequency is
        played through the headphone channel. Another slightly different
        is played through the neurophone circuitry to the transducer
        disks. If the neurophone were producing hearing by bone
        conduction, the two slightly different frequencies would mix in
        the bone structure of the inner ear producing a discernible beat
        frequency. With the nerophone, this beat frequency is heard only
        at very high volume levels in both channels, levels at which the
        neurophone probably producing bone conduction by the strong
        vibration of the skin under each transducer disk. However the
        beat frequency should theoretically be heard at all volume
        levels and yet it is not heard at normal neurophonic listening
        levels. The neurophonic experience is therefore probably a new
        way to hear, using a new channel into the brain: the skin. </p>
      <p>The neurophone is an electronic audio information processor
        designed and sold for experimental and entertainment purposes.
        The electronic circuitry of the neurophone accepts an input from
        any audio or Hi Fi system. It converts the audio signal into a
        digital like low voltage electrical signal that activates two
        small transducer disks. These two disks or electrodes may be
        placed anywhere on the bare skin of the listener. When the
        transducers are in contact with the skin, the audio signal will
        then be perceived in the persons head. There are no hazardous
        voltages or currents between the two sensor disks. There are no
        radio frequency carriers involved in the action of the
        neurophone. The neurophone thinkman operates from a 9 volt
        transistor radio type battery which is enclosed in its case. </p>
      <p>The audio signal source for the neurophone may be a portable
        cassette tape player, a radio, or a stereo Hi Fi system. Most
        modern cassette tape machines and Hi Fi stereo systems have a
        headphone or external speaker output jack. The neurophone output
        goes through two 1 inch diameter transducer disks fabricated of
        Zirconium Titinate which are imbedded in acrylic plastic tiles
        to protect the brittle disks against breakage. The transducer
        disks are, nevertheless, still fragile and should be treated
        carefully because hard physical shocks will break them. If a
        transducer disk is broken by rough handling, a new set of
        transducer disks may be obtained from us. Insert the plug at the
        end of the transducer lead into the jack labeled electrode on
        the end of the thinkman. </p>
      <p>Connect your neurophone to an audio source such as a cassette
        machine by means of an audio connecting cable. The small plug on
        your connecting cable will usually fit into the headphone output
        or external speaker jack on your machine, the other plug on your
        connecting cable will plug into the audio jack on the
        neurophone. Before plugging the cable into your cassette jack,
        adjust the output volume control on your machine to a 50% or
        higher level to ensure that the signal processor on your
        neurophone is receiving an adequate signal level. Turn on the
        neurophone by rotating the volume control in a clockwise
        direction. The red LED indicator light will glow, indicating the
        neurophone is on. Place the two transducer disks on the bare
        skin on either side of the forehead; They may be held in place
        by the elastic headband supplied with the unit. Turn the volume
        control clockwise to about mid way. Turn on your audio source so
        that the signal will now play through the neurophone. Place the
        electrode disks on the skin of your temples, plug up your ears,
        and the audio signal should be heard, appearing to exist in the
        middle of your head. If necessary, adjust the neurophone volume
        control until the signal is heard. </p>
      <p>As you become more experienced in neurophone listening, you
        will find that you will be able to place the two transducer
        disks on the bare skin in spots other than the forehead. One
        neurophone listener reports excellent neurophone listening with
        one transducer disk on the soft flesh of one leg and the other
        transducer on the soft skin of the stomach. However, the
        neurophone must be operated at a higher volume setting to obtain
        the same level of neurophone hearing under such remote
        transducer locations. The ability of the transducer disks to
        function at a location of the skin remote from the head is
        partially explained by the current operating hypothesis. </p>
      <p>If your neurophone begins to sound weak and the red LED
        indicator on the front panel begins to glow very dimly, replace
        the battery in the unit. Unfasten the four phillips head screws
        holding the bottom on the case and remove the bottom plate.
        Inside, you will find a battery clip and a 9 volt transistor
        battery. Replace the battery with a fresh one. For best results,
        use an alkaline battery which will provide more than 10 hours of
        neurophone use under normal conditions. </p>
      <p>The neurophone processes audio information in such a way that
        the frequency domain is eliminated but the time domain is
        preserved. Studies with earlier versions of the neurophone by
        Tufts University for the US Navy as long ago as 1966 indicated
        that the brain initially may have difficulty in recognizing the
        neurophone signals due to gaps in perception. The user may not
        be able to perceive certain frequencies and time domains in
        portions of the audio spectrum. As you use your neurophone,
        these holes in your neurophone hearing process will disappear,
        as your brain learns to recognize these energies, and you will
        begin to hear neurophonic sound with full frequency and wide
        dynamic range. </p>
      <p>The neurophone is an experimental listening device that may by
        continuous use stimulate and enhance dormant perceptive
        abilities in the user. For example, since the device is
        apparently stimulating pathways to the brain that are not used
        normally, it may increase intelligence, telepathic ability, and
        neural efficiency. Dr. Flanagan has used the neurophone longer
        than anyone in existence, and has developed extremely high
        neural efficiency scores. He believes this increase in brain
        efficiency is directly related to the use of the neurophone
        device. Many long term neurophone users report increased
        awareness, telepathic ability, out of body experiences, better
        memory, and increased auditory frequency range. A commercial
        pilot from Saudi Arabia reported a recovery of hearing damage
        due to aural trauma resulting from the loud aircraft engine
        noise as a result of his job. Please note however, that the
        neurophone is an experimental device, and has many uses that
        have been untapped. The neurophone owner will have to experiment
        and discover his own uses for the device. Dr Flanagan used his
        own neurophone to learn the Arabic language; actress Susan
        Strasberg found that she could learn her stage lines easier by
        playing them through the device. A recent book by G. Harry
        Stine, titled THE SILICON GODS by Dell, discusses the
        possibility of using the neurophone as a part of a mind computer
        link in which the power of the human mind could be amplified by
        millions of times. Stine says that the entire process if
        feasible right now, with the help of the neurophone and state of
        the art brain scan technology. Tom Bearden, in his book
        EXCALIBER BRIEFING says that the neurophone may eventually be
        used to successfully enable one or more people to do a perfect
        mind link in which the power of multiple minds may solve all
        world problems. </p>
      <p>We hope that neurophone owners will join us in the task of
        discovering and using the potential of the device. The field of
        neurophone research is wide open, in the future we will see the
        development of neurophone software and hardware as well as
        neurophone user's league, our own neurophone magazine, and a
        host of other neurophone support devices. We invite all
        neurophone owners to share their experiences with us, so that we
        may share them with others. </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The skin contains many energy sensing mechanism, one such
        mechanism is known as the Pacinian Corpuscle. The PC is a
        special nerve ending that transforms mechanical vibrations or
        pressures into nerve impulses. Until this year, (1980) very
        little was known about thie transducer, and it was thought that
        the device could only work at low frequencies of stimulation. </p>
      <p>Recent research by Fernando Grandori and Antonio Pedotti of
        Milan, Italy has shed a whole new light on this mechanism. (<i>IEEE








          Transaction on Biomedical Engineering,</i>, Vol BME-27, #10,
        Oct 1980) It now seems that the PC can react to very high
        frequencies, and responds best to a square wave stimulus. </p>
      <p>The PC consists of a sensitive nerve ending surrounded by a
        cylindrical-like core structre consisting of closely packed
        membranes called lamellae. The core is surrounded by a second
        set of lamellae, in which the distance between each one
        increases from the innermost lamella toward the periphery of the
        corpuscle. The space between all the lameae is filled with a
        liquid whos mechanical properties can be considered similar to
        that of water. When a displacement of the outermost lamella is
        caused by exerting an appropriate pressure, this stimulus is
        transmitted to the core, and in turn, causes a compression of
        the innermost lamella. This system acts as a differentiating
        mechanical amplifier. </p>
      <p>What is significant here, is that the PC responds best to a
        Squarewave. The above paper reveals that rate of change is more
        important than the <br>
        amplitude of the pressure applied to the corpuscule. This
        indicates that this highly refined receptor is designed to
        detect time significance first, and pressure significance
        secondly. </p>
      <p>If we take the Neurophone electrode disks and feed a 50 volt
        sine wave audio signal into them while placing them on the
        temples, the signal will be percieved weakly. If we feed the
        same signal as a square wave, the percieved is 10 times as loud
        as the sine wave. This tends to substantiate Dr Flanagan's
        theory reguarding the Neurophone perceptual mechanism as being
        timerate of change encoded. </p>
      <p>PC are located over the entire skins surface, with greater
        concentrations on the fingertips and sexual organs. In 1981 Dr
        Flanagan intends to develop research projects which will be able
        to evaluate the PC theory. </p>

          <b>A Possible Mechanism for Neurophonic Action</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Neurophone is a new electronic invention that may enable us
        to hear by a completely new information channel to the brain.
        Ordinary hearing is the result of the stimulation of bones in
        the inner ear by means of vibration. Sound waves may reach these
        bones through ear canal via the ear drum, or by bone conduction
        in which sound waves are conducted to the inner ear vibrations
        in the crainial bones. </p>
      <p>When the sound waves reach the inner ear, a vibration is set up
        in the cochlea which then converts the waves into nerve inpulses
        that travel up the 8th Crainial Nerve to the sound recognition
        centers of the brain. </p>
      <p>In 1958, Dr Flanagan, then a child of 14 developed a radio
        transmitter that made the brain into a radio reciever. This
        device transmits acoustic information to the brain by means of
        radio waves into the skin, bypassing the 8th Crainial Nerve.
        When he applied for a patent on the device, the patent examiner
        rejected the whole thing saying that such a device would go
        against all known laws of science. ver the following years, Dr
        Flanagan fought against insurmontable odds to prove that the
        device did indeed work. In the meantime, LIFE magazine ran a
        major article on Flanagan and the Neurophone, naming him as one
        of the top ten scientists in the US at the age of 17! In a final
        desperate move Flanagan flew to the patent office with a model
        of his invention and successfully demonstrated the device on a
        deaf employee in the patent examiner's office. The deaf man
        heard music for the first time in 15 years and broke down into
        tears. The examiner declared that the Nurophone was indeed a
        basic patentable device and approved the patent for release.
        Patent # 3,393,279 dated 16 July 1968.......... </p>
      <p>In the years that Dr Flanagan fought to recieve deserved
        recognition by the patent office, he grew into manhood and was
        working on Man-Dolphin Communications for the US Navy when the
        patent was finally issued. While involved in Man-Dolphin
        research, he became interested in nerve signal information
        encoding, and began to develop electronic circuits that
        duplicated the process of pattern recognityion observed in the
        human nervous system. This work led to research in Cryptography.
        During that period he developed a top secret sound scrambler
        that was virtually impossible to decode. Part of the scrambler
        was based on his research into nerve encoding. </p>
      <p>Dr Flanagan believed that the pattern of nerve encoding used in
        the human speech recognition system could be used to make a
        better Neurophone. He succeeded in perfecting an electronic
        curcuit that he believes duplicates the precise encoding of the
        Cochlea and 8th Crainial Nerve. When he applied for a patent on
        the new circuit, the patent aplication was immediately placed
        under top secrecy by the National Security Agency. The only
        explnation given at the time was that the circuit had potential
        uses in the defense of the country. Dr Flanagan was happy that
        the government considered that his device could be used in his
        country's defense. The only problem was that the government
        wanted the devise free, and he spent 14 years on it. </p>
      <p>He hired attorneys and challenged the secrecy order for over
        five years. At the end of that period, the patent was released
        from secrecy and was approved for issue by the patent office.
        Patent # 3,647,970 dated 7 Mar 1972. </p>
      <p>Dr Flanagan then perfected the circuit for another five years.
        This circuit recognizes time-relationships in the signal
        waveform, and generates a square wave that is time encoded. Dr
        Flanagan believes that the nervous system uses a complex deley
        line time recognition computational system that recognises time
        information. (50KHZ square wave pulse width audio modulation
        with double differentiator output) </p>
      <p>In July of 1978, he successfully applied the Time Recognition
        Processor to his Neurophone. When an audio signal is processed
        through his circuit, it is converted into a form which he
        believes is an electronic analog of the nerve signal released
        from the human cochlea, but with one major difference; in the
        cochlea hundreds of nerves carry the time-encoded signal to the
        brain. In the case of the Neurophone, the full signal processing
        is complete and may be carried to the brain by alternate
        pathways. Through the skin itself. </p>
      <p>In the original Neurophone, a 3000 volt amplitude modulated
        radio wave carried the signal to a pair of insulated electrodes
        that were placed on the head of the subject. In the present
        Neurophone, the voltage has been reduced to a 50 volt (maximum)
        square wave. This signal is applied to the body by means of
        ceramic disks.(zirconium titanate) The ceramic disks allow the
        energy field to affect the skin without a current flow. The
        small electric field causes the skin to vibrate internally in
        rhythim with the stimulation. The intea-dermal vibration can be
        heard by others if they place there own ears near the point of
        electrode skin contact. The vibration is not powerful enough
        however, to vibrate the bone below the skin surface. </p>
      <p>For the past year, Dr Flanagan has been developing a theory
        which would explain how the Neurophone actually works in the
        body. Some mechanism must exist that transmits the information
        from skin to the brain. </p>
      <p>The Neurophone has been out now for nearly five months, and we
        are starting to get reports back from layman and professional
        users. The inital results are exciting. Several people have
        reported that their ability to remember data is increasing.
        People who could not remember telephone numbers are becoming
        walking phone books! </p>
      <p>The first professional research report has been written by Dr
        Sheldon Deal, D.C., N.D.; of Tucson, Az. Dr Deal is director of
        the Swan Clinic, and is current President of the International
        College of Applied Kinesiology. </p>
      <p>Dr Deal's preliminary Neurophone research paper was recently
        presented at the I.C.A.K. convention in Detroit. With Dr Deal's
        permission, we are publishing his entire paper in INNERGY NEWS.

      </center>
      <p>Another device that uses the new hyperspatial, virtual state,
        nested modulation technology (and has done so for 17 or 18
        years) is Dr. Pat Flanagan's neurophone. With brilliant insight
        and intuition far beyond that of science at the time, Pat
        invented and patented the instrument by the time he was
        seventeen years old. The neurophone is a device that, contrary
        to all present theory and knowledge, will directly pump the
        brain and reproduce sound and information directly in the brain
        and mind system, without going through the auditory system at
        all. A simplified diagram of Pat's improved neurophone is shown
        in the figure. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the device takes a complex signal, such as the sound
        of an orchestra playing a musical interlude, and electrically
        processes it as shown in the figure. First the signal is passed
        into a section that clips everything into a series of square
        waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of clipped waves
        Lisitsyn confirms are the information carriers of the human
        brain. Next the square waves are differentiated, ielding a
        series of sharp spikes (note that these spikes retain the pulse
        time content of the clipped signal). These spikes are again
        differentiated, and since these are finite <br>
        spikes with real nonzero rize times and decay times rather than
        theoretical constructs, a series of noisy spikes results from
        the second differentiator section. From here, the noisy spikes
        are introduced to special contact electrodes, one of which is
        normally placed on the forehead, while the other may be placed
        almost anywhere, including on the foot. Nowhere are any sound
        waves introduced to the head. </p>
      <p>The square wave clipper section reduces the complex signals,
        their overtones, and their complex modulations to square waves,
        retaining the <br>
        temporal content of the wave mix but not the waves themselves.
        The first and second differentiators highten or filter through
        the temporal content of the higher order differentiations, that
        is, they serve as a band pass filter unit to accent the time
        keying of the neutrinic and mind field portions or aspects of
        the signal. When these time spikes are then introduced across
        the body as pulsed voltages, they are modulated directly on the
        dendrite firings of the brain and nervous system, providing
        direct and pulsed modulation of the neutrnic and mind field
        component channels of the mind brain consciousness life loop
        itself. Thus the neurophone directly inputs information into the
        brain and nervous system, bypassing all the normal sensory
        systems that lie between the mind brain loop and outside
        environment. </p>

        <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1958, when I was fourteen years old, a close friend of mine,
        Lou Macko, a television repairman in Houston, Texas told me of a
        most unusual phenomenon. He told me of a device that would
        transmit sound to the brain without using the ears. </p>
      <p>The description of the device had been given to him by a
        complete stranger when he had visited Chicago. The device
        consisted of two copper mesh scrub pads with wires attached to
        them. The pads were placed in a pair of plastic bags to act as
        insulators. The wires were then connected to the high voltage
        side of an audio output transformer which was connected back to
        back with the output of an ordinary record player. </p>
      <p>The result is shown in the figure. </p>
      <p>The voltage from the Hi Fi was stepped up a bit and applied to
        the pads. If the pads were placed on the skin of the head in the
        vicinity of the temples, one would "hear" the sound from the Hi
        Fi as if it were coming from within the head itself. </p>
      <p>The item at that time had no practical advantage as it was
        extremely distorted. A good deal of the sound seemed to be
        missing as if it were cut off. </p>
      <p>I researched at the library and discovered the phenomenon was
        known as far back as 1800 and was discovered by Volta. It was
        called electrophonic hearing. It was believed that the
        phenomenon was merely the action of the muscles being
        electrically stimulated and affecting the bones in the ear by
        means of minute muscle vibration. </p>
      <p>I examined the signal from the device by oscilloscope and
        discovered the sound came through in a blast when the
        transformer was overloaded and produced a sharp spike or ringing
        on the wave form. I soon discovered that the real information
        was coming through only when this effect occurred. This
        explained why only parts of the music and voice came through. </p>
      <p>I reasoned that the true carrier of information was a radio
        signal due to the oscillation produced by shock excitation of
        the combined circuit of the transformer and the parallel tuned
        circuit formed by the electrodes and the human body. I started
        experimenting with the unit using a high frequency oscillator of
        my own design and discovered a resonance in the circuit around
        40,000 cycles per second. I soon found that the resonant
        frequency would change abruptly with emotions and general body
        changes. The capacitance of the electrodes, therefore the
        dielectric constant of the skin, changed abruptly from the
        slightest outside stimulus. The dielectric constant of the skin
        would change by several orders of magnitude in a fraction of a
        second! After preliminary measurement of parameters, I designed
        the original Neurophone which is illustrated in my patent on the
        device. (#3,393,279) </p>
      <p>The device was essentially a high voltage frequency modulated
        radio transmitter of low power. Its frequency was adjustable to
        correct for changes of resonance. The original unit was hand
        adjustable. Later units were automatically tuned for maximum
        resonance. </p>
      <p>The addition of the resonant radio carrier wave made the
        difference. The sound from the device was fantastic, like sound
        from another world. The normal frequency response of the ear was
        extended beyond normal boundaries and there was no distortion. </p>
      <p>I began experimenting with a number of people who were
        considered to be totally nerve deaf, that is, they were unable
        to hear anything, even with what is known as bone conduction.
        The results were spectacular. People who had not heard in years
        were now hearing sounds they only dreamed of ever recapturing. A
        patent was applied for, and my research continued. </p>
      <p>The press learned of my discovery and articles appeared on the
        front pages of 300 newspapers, and it was picked up by news
        syndicates and international magazines around the world. LIFE
        did an article in Sept 14, 1962 page 69, 72. The results were as
        spectacular as the discovery. We received hundreds of thousands
        of letters from all over the world. Letters came from as far
        away as Tasmania addressed only to Pat Flanagan, Inventor,
        Texas, U.S.A. The U.S. Postal service did a spectacular job in
        getting the mail to the right party. </p>
      <p>There were many Neurophone discoveries not made public. On
        occasions the device stimulated perfect telepathic contact
        between one or more persons, often with startling results. These
        telepathic incidents were kept under wraps for fear of ridicule.

        <b><font size="+1">Patrick Flanagan's Neurophone --- Hope for
            the Deaf and Superlearning for All</font></b>
        <p><b>by</b> <br>
          <b>Eddy Taylor</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In 1958, Dr. Patrick Flanagan invented the Neurophone in
        Bellaire, Texas when he was 14 years old. This electronic device
        transmits sound through the skin, by-passing normal hearing. A
        family friend who was a patent attorney for Shell Oil, helped
        Patrick submit a patent application. The patent examiners
        thought that this was just sound transfer through bone
        conduction and refused to issue a patent for 12 years. In a rare
        meeting in 1970, the patent office agreed to examine the
        Neurophone for themselves and meet Patrick and his attorney.
        They both encountered a surprise. The examiner had a deaf
        employee attend the meeting to test the device. The man was
        totally nerve deaf in one ear and almost totally deaf in the
        other. Patrick showed him how to use the Neurophone and played a
        record of the famous Maria Callas singing an opera. As he was
        able to hear the undistorted beauty of her voice, the tears of
        joy streamed down his face. </p>
      <p>For the first time in history the Patent Office reopened a file
        after it was officially closed and Patrick Flanagan received
        United States Patent Number 3,393,279. Prior to this, scientists
        thought that sound could only be perceived by the inner ear to
        the brain. </p>
      <p>A Houston Post reporter had a relative who was nerve deaf from
        spinal meningitis. A test was arranged and when the device
        worked, an explosion of news coverage resulted in the story
        being carried on the international wire services. </p>
      <p><b>How the genie was lost ~</b> </p>
      <p>In an agonizing infringement, a Defense Intelligence Agency
        sealed the patent and a national security order forbade Patrick
        from working on, or even talking about this invention. After
        many years and nearly 300 inventions later, Patrick received the
        Neurophone for public use. In a triumphant court case, the
        secrecy and the seizure of the device, by the Government Agency,
        was overruled and the genie was out of the bottle! </p>
      <p><b>Electronic hearing and telepathy ~</b> </p>
      <p>To quote Patrick's Neurophone article in Nexus
        Magazine-Feb/March 1994, "All hearing aids stimulate tiny bones
        in the ear. In order for bone conduction to work, the cochlea or
        inner ear that connects to the 8th cranial nerve must function.
        People who are nerve deaf cannot hear through bone conduction
        because the nerves in the inner ear are not functional. A number
        of nerve deaf people who have had the entire inner ear removed
        by surgery have been able to hear with the Neurophone. </p>
      <p>The Neurophone is really an electronic telepathy machine.
        Several tests prove that it bypasses the 8th cranial nerve or
        hearing nerve and transmits sound directly to the brain. This
        means that the Neurophone stimulates perception through a 7th or
        Alternate Sense!" </p>
      <p><b>The Texas home of the Neurophone ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Neurophone became publicly available on a broad scale for
        the first time in July, 1996. An international Health Products
        company is now distributing the Neurophone. This corporation is
        based in Dallas, Texas and was established in 1976. A digitally
        computerized model is now being developed by Patrick and his
        wife Gael Crystal in their laboratory in Sedona, Arizona. </p>
      <p><b>Turning on our neurophysiological potential for health,
          knowledge and awareness ~</b> </p>
      <p>One of the last statements by Nikola Tesla, inventor of
        alternating current, the radio and holder of well over 1,000
        patents, was that he regretted not having done more in the
        science of electromedicine. In 1962, Patrick predicted that
        electromedicine would revolutionize conventional health care.
        One of the relatively unknown, silent revolutions has already
        taken place in the form of blood and lymph cleansing devices.
        These simple, yet powerful, electronic devices have been
        popularized by Bob Beck, physicist and bio electronic researcher
        and Hulda Clark, N.D. </p>
      <p>In 1990, a remarkable discovery was made by Steven Kaali, MD
        and William Lyman, associate Professor of Pathology at Einstein
        College of Medicine in N.Y.C. It was shown that a minute current
        (50-100 micro amperes) can alter outer protein layers of the HIV
        virus and prevent it's attachment to receptor sites. (Science
        News March 30, 1991, pg. 207). The viruses loose the ability to
        make an enzyme crucial to their reproduction. This process may
        also reverse Epstein Barr (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), Hepatitis
        and Herpes B. Responsible users of this technology who are HIV
        positive, may expect a Negative P24 surface antigen or PCR test
        (no more HIV detectable in blood) after 30 days. A simplified
        version of this unit now makes self help feasible. The potential
        to clean and potentize the blood banks of the world with this
        instrument is truly staggering. Bob Beck's Sept. 96 Explore
        Magazine Article notes a study on the life span of blood cells
        sealed under cover slips on microscope slides. While the average
        life of "normal" blood is about 4 days; blood cells treated with
        a mild microcurrent live for well over a month! </p>
      <p>This very mild charging of the blood does not harm blood cells.
        Furthermore, the applied physics of Eddy Current (Lenz's law)
        demonstrates the neutralization of a myriad of parasites,
        viruses, microbes and fungi. It is important to realize that
        these organisms are critical co-factors, if not actual carriers,
        regarding the multitude of new deadly contagious diseases
        appearing throughout the world. </p>
      <p>These blood cleansing devices are safe, with intelligent use,
        have been around for decades, and seem to have a variety of
        other benefits. You can do your own research on the scientific
        evidence by scanning
        (http:/www.electriciti.com/explore/Articles/Beck/HIVArticle.html).
        Be aware that there are now customized, blood and lymph
        cleansing units far better than Mr. Beck, Dr. Clark, and most
        others, describe and or advertise. </p>
      <p><b>The big turn off ~</b> </p>
      <p>By contrast, the HAARP Project, a giant array of microwave
        towers in Anchorage Alaska, may not exactly raise awareness and

        impact an entire nation or even a complete hemisphere of the
        world. You may find the rest of the story through the writings
        of Nick Begich and other investigators. This brings new meaning
        to that old expression used in T.V. and Radio, "Don't touch that
        dial!" Nick is a life long educator, native of Alaska, and has
        been featured on thousands of radio programs in the last 4
        years. He also is perhaps the most informed writer on the
        Patrick Flanagan story and the benefits of the Neurophone. </p>
      <p><b>Education Automation Vacation ~</b> </p>
      <p>Scientific experiments indicate that effects of the Neurophone
        range from super learning, long term memory speed learning,
        relaxation, pain control and enhanced psychic abilities. The
        Neurophone's ability to transfer large amounts of information
        into long term memory may, alone, make the current model of
        education obsolete. We could advance beyond the problem of
        information overload and actually emphasize values, goals,
        strategy and a profound interdisciplinary approach to world
        problems. Positive solutions in an ever more complex world may
        themselves depend on the solution offered by the responsible use
        of the Neurophone. </p>
      <p><b>Ma Bell ~</b> </p>
      <p>Studies on a special "head start" program, with pregnant women
        using the Neurophone have promising news. These women describe
        children with marked intelligence. This neuro-networking seems
        actually to nurture neuropathways for the fetus. </p>
      <p><b>Extra sensory perceptions ~</b> </p>
      <p>All organs of perceptions evolve from the skin of the child
        within the womb. Theoretically, the skin could perform all sense
        perception. In Russia blind people have been taught 'to see'
        with their fingertips. Deaf people in Czechoslovakia have been
        instructed 'to hear' with their fingertips. </p>

      <p><b>Dolphin speak ~</b> </p>
      <p>In a curious parallel to Roxanne Kremer's work on interspecies
        communication with the Pink Amazon River Dolphins, Dr. Flanagan
        has made impressive technical contributions. In February, 1968,
        he applied for a patent on a device for translating human speech
        into dolphin language and vice/versa. This was a result of
        studies with dolphins in the lagoon of a small island off the
        coast of Oahu, Hawaii. A vocabulary of 30 words was discovered
        before a startling intervention. Six months after applying for
        the patent, it was placed under secrecy order #756, 124 by a
        U.S.Government surveillance agency. Five years later, another
        hard-fought legal battle rescinded the suppression and patent
        #3,647,970 was granted on March 7th 1972. This speech processing
        patent is actually used as the circuit in the present version of
        the Neurophone. </p>
      <p><b>The sound of the new millennium ~</b> </p>
      <p>"The Music of the Spheres and the Hemispheres", heard with the
        assist of the Neurophone, opens new doors for musicians and
        composers, as well as educators and students of life in general.
        In what may be seen as another motif on Sonic
        Bloom-like-phenomena, some theories hold that it has the
        potential for developing super plants and healing animals as
        well as people. </p>
      <p><b>Mind meld ~</b> </p>
      <p>Experiments with a Neurophone mind link between two or more
        people seemingly makes possible learning directly from the mind
        of another. And I thought this was only in the SCI FI domain of
        Star Trek's Mr. Spock and certainly beyond the ken of Dr. Spock.
        Nick Begich describes the phenomenon as an electronic 'corpus
        collosum' between the minds of 2 people. The corpus collosum is
        the semi-permeable bridge between the 2 hemispheres of an
        individual's brain. </p>
      <p><b>The Neurophone and other gems ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Neurophone also causes both sides of the brain to pulse in
        harmony creating an environment which may be ideal for learning.
        Use of the Neurophone tends to balance all the acupuncture
        meridians. In the near future the Flanagans will produce
        cassette tapes and CD's designed to be used only with the
        Neurophone. The tapes will cover categories as varied as Psychic
        Center Stimulation to Subliminal Learning Programs. </p>

        The people of Hunza claim that their longevity, often living up
        to 130, stems primarily from their consumption of Hunza water,
        also known as 'glacial milk'. This technology has also been used

      <p>This invention relates to electromagnetic excitation of the
        nervous system of a mammal and pertains more particularly to a
        method and apparatus for exciting the nervous system of a person
        with electromagnetic waves that are capable of causing that
        person to become conscious of information conveyed by the
        electromagnetic waves. </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a means of
        initiating controllable responses of the neuro senses without
        applying pressure waves or stress waves to the ears or bones.
        Another object of this invention is to provide a means of
        causing a person to receive an aural perception of the sound
        corresponding to the audio modulation of radio frequency
        electromagnetic waves that are coupled with the nervous system
        of the person. These and other objects of this invention will be

      <p>The present invention involves the discovery that certain
        electromagnetic waves induce responses in the nervous systems of
        mammals. In human beings a response is produced when some or all
        of a persons nervous system is placed within a field of
        electromagnetic carrier waves of such a frequency, the nervous
        system is responsive to the modulation of the carrier waves.
        Each individual nervous system is at least somewhat selective in
        respect to the frequencies to which it is most responsive. A
        frequency to which the nervous system of a person is
        demonstratively responsive can be determined by varying the
        frequency of carrier waves that are modulated by an information
        signal, such as speech or music, and measuring the frequency of
        such waves that produce the sensation of hearing the sounds
        corresponding to the modulating signal. </p>
      <p>In the method of the present invention, a response is initiated
        in the nervous system of a mammal by disposing at least a
        portion of that nervous system within a field of electromagnetic
        waves of a frequency above the aural range. In a preferred
        embodiment of this invention, at least a portion of the nervous
        system of a person is exposed to audio modulated electromagnetic
        waves having a radio frequency such that the person experiences
        the sensation of hearing, substantially free of distortion, the
        information which is conveyed by the audio modulation. </p>
      <p>The present invention may be used as a hearing aid, as an aid
        to teaching speech to a person who was born deaf, as a means of
        communicating with persons in locations in which the noise level
        is high, as a device by which a person can listen to an audio
        signal that cannot be heard by others, etc. </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 1 of the drawing, in a preferred form of the
        invention, a field of electromagnetic waves is generated by a
        field generating means, such as a pair of electrodes 1. The
        electrodes 1 are preferably electrically insulated, for example
        by surrounding them with a suitable electrical insulating
        material 2, and are arranged to generate a field coupled with at
        least a portion of the nervous system of a person, for example
        by being placed near or along opposite sides of a persons head.
        The electrodes 1 can be placed in direct contact with the skin
        and the electrodes can be placed on or near various portions of
        the body, such portions preferably being near the spinal cord. </p>
      <p>The electrodes 1 are electrically connected to a source of
        modulated electromagnetic waves inclusive of a radio frequency
        power amplifier and variable frequency oscillator, indicated in
        box 4, a source of audio signal, indicated in box 5, and a power
        supply for the signal source, modulator and amplifier, indicated
        by box 6. The variable frequency oscillator 3 is preferably
        provided with a manual radio frequency control means, indicated
        by box 3a. Numerous forms of the components, indicated in boxes
        3 to 6, that provide suitable power and a source of modulated
        electromagnetic waves are presently known and the known devices
        can be suitably used as long as they are arranged to produce a
        relatively high voltage output that has a radio frequency above
        the audio range and is capable of being modulated by an audio
        signal or other signal adapted to be conveyed by the modulation
        of electromagnetic waves of such a frequency. </p>
      <p>The modulation can suitably be effected by means of either an
        amplitude or frequency modulation of such electromagnetic waves.
        These waves preferably have a frequency in the range of about 20
        kilocycles per second to about 200 kilocycles per second. The
        output of the source of modulated electromagnetic waves is
        preferably at least about 1 watt where the field generator
        comprises a pair of insulated electrodes placed on the head of a
        person. The extent to which a person is aurally perceptive to
        the output supplied at a given wattage is materially increased
        when at least one of the electrodes is placed in electrical
        contact with the body of the person. </p>
      <p>In a preferred mode of operating the apparatus shown in Figure
        1, the electrodes 1 are placed on the sides of the head of a
        person. The source 5 of audio signal is actuated to produce an
        audio signal corresponding to sounds recognizable by that
        person, and source 3 of modulated electromagnetic waves is
        actuated to couple the waves with the nervous system of that
        person. When control 3A is adjusted so that the frequency of the
        modulated waves is a frequency to which his nervous system is
        particularly responsive, the person to whom the field of such
        waves is applied has the sensation of hearing the sounds
        corresponding to the audio signal substantially free of
        distortion. </p>
      <p>In the circuit shown in Figure 2, a phase shift type of carrier
        oscillation, generally designated by dotted rectangle 7, with a
        frequency control, generally designated by rectangle 8, is
        arranged to produce electromagnetic waves, shown at A, a
        frequency ranging from about 20 to 200 kilocycles per second.
        The oscillator output is coupled through capacitor 9 to a radio
        frequency power amplifier, generally designated by a dotted
        rectangle 10. Potentiometer 11, which is connected between
        capacitor 9 and ground, provides a means of adjusting the input
        to the amplifier. Switch 12, which is connected to the cathode
        of tube 13 of the amplifier, provides a means of switching
        between resistors 14 and 15 to vary the operating power
        characteristics of the tube. </p>
      <p>The output of amplifier 10 is connected to transformer 16 which
        is coupled back-to-back with transformer 17. This arrangement of
        transformers provides an inductive load such that the amplifier
        yields a high voltage output is isolated from other components
        of the circuit. Resistor 18 connected across the output side of
        transformer 17 serves to reduce any dangerous voltage spikes
        which might be produced. The output side of transformer 17 is
        connected to a suitable field generator, which may comprise the
        electrodes 1 surrounded by insulating material 2. </p>
      <p>The output of amplifier 10 is amplitude modulated by means of
        the modulator generally designated by dotted rectangle 19. A
        fluctuating electrical signal B, preferably of audio frequency,
        is applied to the modulator by means of input jack 20 and
        transformer 21. The output of the modulator varies the screen
        voltage of tube 13 of the amplifier so that the modulation
        envelope of the current oscillations C produced across the load
        of tube 13 correspond to the fluctuating signal B applied to the
        modulator. </p>
      <p>Potentiometer 22 is connected to the cathode of tube 23 as the
        cathode resistor of tube 23. Potentiometer 22 is preferably
        adjusted so that the plate current of tube 13 of the amplifier
        so that the modulation envelope of the current oscillation C
        produced across the load of tube 13 correspond to the
        fluctuating signal B applied to the modulator. </p>
      <p>Potentiometer 22 is connected to the cathode of tube 23 as the
        cathode resistor of tube 23. Potentiometer 22 is preferable
        adjusted so that the plate current of tube 13 is about half its
        normal maximum value. The fluctuating signal applied to
        modulator 19 is then adjusted to cause the plate current of tube
        13 to vary between the maximum and minimum values so that a
        large current variation occurs in the load 16 of tube 13. </p>
      <p>The apparatus shown in Figure 2 has been used to communicate
        speech and music to numerous persons including registered
        physicians. In these uses the electrodes 1, in the form of
        circular disc covered by a plastic insulation 2, were placed
        against the sides of the heads of the persons. When the
        electromagnetic waves were adjusted to a frequency to which
        persons having normal hearing were selectively responsive, none
        of these persons perceived any sensations of hearing or
        experienced any discomfort when no audio modulation was applied
        to the waves. When the waves were audio modulated with a speech
        or music signal, none of these persons experienced any
        discomfort, but they each had the sensation of listening to the
        transmitted information and hearing it at least as clearly as
        they would hear such information from an audible transmitter.
        When the same apparatus was similarly employed on a person whose
        hearing had been damaged to an extent requiring a hearing aid to
        hear normal conversation, that person heard the audio signal
        (with this hearing aid disconnected) and heard music with a
        better fidelity than that obtainable with this hearing aid. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 shows an arrangement for mounting the field generating
        means in a position such that a portion of a persons nervous
        system may be moved into and out of coupling with the field at
        the will of the person. In this arrangement, electrodes 1
        surrounded by insulation 2 are mounted in vertical alignment
        along the back of a seating device, such as chair 24. When a
        person is seated and leaning back in the chair, portions of his
        nervous system are brought into coupling relationship with the
        field produced by electrodes 1. </p>
      <p>Figure 4 shows an alternative arrangement of the field
        generating means. In this arrangement, inductive coil 25 is
        connected to the output of a suitable source of modulated
        electromagnetic waves and serves as a field generating means
        which is adapted to be placed around the head of a person. </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the above embodiments and examples
        have been presented for descriptive purposes and that, within
        the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced
        otherwise than specifically illustrated and described. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A speech waveform is converted to a constant amplitude square
        wave in which the transitions between the amplitude extremes are
        spaced so as to carry the speech information. The system
        includes a pair of tuned amplifier circuits which act as
        high-pass filters having a 6 decibel per octave slope from 0 to
        15,ooo cycles followed by two stages, each comprised of an
        amplifier and clipper circuit. For converting the filtered
        waveform to a square wave. A radio transmitter and receiver
        having a plurality of separate channels within a conventional
        single side band transmitter bandwidth and a system for
        transmitting secure speech information are also disclosed. </p>
      <p><b>Background of Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to electronic processing of
        speech, and more particularly relates to a method and system for
        simplifying the speech waveform to facilitate transmission of
        the speech throughout various media without materially degrading
        intelligibility. </p>
      <p>In the process of producing human speech, the voice box creates
        a series of sound pulses which reverberate within and are shaped
        by the upper throat and mouth cavity. The frequency of the
        pulses produced by the voice box primarily determines the
        frequency or pitch of the sound, while the shape of the mouth
        cavity reverberates and shapes the sound pulses to produce the
        speech information. The resulting speech waveform is very
        complex and highly redundant. If such a waveform is passed
        through a band-pass filter having a bandwidth significantly less
        than 3000 cycles per second, the speech becomes unintelligible.
        Thus, even the simplest voice communication channels require a
        substantial bandwidth. Heretofore it has been commonly believed
        that the speech information was contained in the amplitude as
        well as the frequency modulation of the speech waveform, When
        voice sounds are induced in a body of water or the earth, the
        many reverberations caused by the various velocity
        discontinuities make speech unintelligible over relatively short
        transmission lengths. Also, the complex speech waveform has made
        encoding or scrambling for secure transmissions, either by
        electromagnetic, electrical, or pressure waves, so impractical
        as to be very seldom used. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of Invention Claimed ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is concerned with a method and system for
        simplifying a complex speech waveform so that it can be used for
        a multitude of applications. The simplified speech waveform may
        be passed through a narrow band-pass filter, thus permitting a
        greater number of communication channels within a given
        frequency band. The simplified speech waveform can be
        transmitted directly through the earth or water as a pressure
        wave and understand, either directly from the medium, or after
        simple amplification. The simplified waveform can be easily
        encoded by scrambling to provide secure voice communications.
        The simplified may be sued to operate machinery, produces more
        efficient public address systems and transmitters with greater
        range peak power for a given average power, and thus longer
        ranges. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, the speech waveform
        is converted to a signal having substantially constant upper and
        lower levels with abrupt transitions from one level to the
        other, the abrupt transitions being in time correspondence to
        amplitude changes in the speech waveform that exceed a
        predetermined rate of change. This is accomplished by a system
        including a high-pass filter and means for converting the
        filtered waveform to a constant amplitude, substantially square
        wave. </p>
      <p>More specifically, optimum results have been achieved by using
        a filter having a 12 decibel per octave slope from 0 to 15,000
        cycles per second. In one specific embodiment, this filter is
        formed by a pair of tuned amplifier circuits each having a 6
        decibel per octave slope within the frequency range of interest.
        In this embodiment, the speech waveform is preferably combined
        with a high frequency noise masking signal of lower amplitude
        prior to processing. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another specific aspect of the invention,
        means for converting the filtered signal to a square wave
        comprises at least one amplifier followed by a clipper circuit.
      </p>
      <p>The invention also contemplates a voice communication system
        having a plurality of separate channels within a bandwidth
        normally allotted for a single frequency, for example four
        channels within a bandwidth of 1500 cycles per second. In this
        system the processes speech is selectively passed through one of
        a plurality of narrow band-pass filters to a transmitter. The
        receiver has similar narrow band-pass filters so as to be
        selectively sensitive to transmissions in that pass band. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another specific aspect of the invention,
        each transition of the square wave is converted to a pulse of
        predetermined amplitude and width, which is then converted into
        a plurality of pulses with predetermined time spacing. These
        pulses are then transmitted to a receiver where the plurality of
        spaced pulses are recombined as one pulse. The square wave is
        then reproduced from the combined pulses. </p>

      <p><b>Description of Preferred Embodiments ~</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to Figure 1, a
        speech processor in accordance with the present invention is
        indicated generally by the reference numeral 10. The speech
        waveform is applied to the input 12 as a voltage signal derived
        from a microphone (not illustrated) or other suitable
        transducer. The speech waveform is summed with a much higher
        frequency, for example 50 KHz, masking signal produced by the
        signal generator 14. This signal is passed through a pair of
        tuned amplifier circuits 16 and 18. Each of the circuits 16 and
        18 is a high-pass filter having a 6 decibel per octave slope
        from 0 to 15,000 cycles per second, thus providing a combined
        slope of 12 decibels per octave. </p>
      <p>The filtered waveform is then passed through a circuit means
        for converting the filtered waveform to a square wave which is
        converting the filtered waveform to a square wave which is
        comprised of a first high gain amplifier 20, a first clipper
        circuit 22, a second high gain amplifier 24, and a second
        clipper circuit 26. The square wave is then passed through power
        amplifier 28 to the output in a form to drive a loudspeaker,
        transducer, radio transmitter or the like. When ultimately
        passed through a speaker, or other suitable transducer, the
        square wave is fairly intelligible. The square wave so produced
        has constant upper and lower levels, with very abrupt
        transitions between the upper and lower levels as a result of
        the two stages of amplification and clipping. The transitions
        occur in time correspondence to amplitude changes in the
        original speech waveform applied to the input 12 that exceed a
        predetermined rate of change so as to be passed through the
        high-pass filters 16 and 18. </p>
      <p>A detailed circuit diagram of the system 1o us shown in Figure
        2 wherein corresponding components are designated by
        corresponding reference numerals. Each of the components is of
        conventional design. The signal generator 14 has a variable load
        resistor 30 in the output stage which permits the amplitude of
        the masking signal to be adjusted to eliminate oscillations
        caused by noise. The amplitude of the masking signal should not
        be any greater than is required to prevent oscillation to
        minimize interference with the processing of the speech
        waveform. The tuned amplifier circuits 16 and 18 are of
        identical construction. Each is comprised of an amplifier having
        a differential input state 32 and a single output stage 34 which
        drives a tuned filter circuit 36. The tuned amplifier circuits
        16 and 18 are coupled by capacitor 38, which of course also
        comprises an element of the filter. The amplifier 20 is
        identical to the amplifier portions of the tuned amplifiers 16
        and 18, and is coupled to the output of tuned amplifiers 16 and
        18, and is coupled to the output of tuned amplifier 18 by
        capacitor 40. The clipper circuit 22 is merely a diode bridge to
        the output of tuned amplifier 18 by capacitor 40. The clipper
        circuit 22 is merely a diode bridge coupled to the output of
        amplifier 20 by capacitor 42, followed by a filter comprised of
        capacitor 44 and resistor 46. The output of the clipper circuit
        22 is coupled to the input of amplifier 24 by capacitor 50.
        Amplifier 28 is identical to amplifiers 20 and 24 and is coupled
        to the output of the clipper circuit 26 by capacitor 52. </p>
      <p>In a typical embodiment of the circuit of Figure 2, the PNP
        transistors may be MPS3640 transistors, and the diodes may be
        IN914 diodes. The resistors have the following values in kilohms
        as referenced in circuits 16 and 22: a = 33, b = 33, c = 10, d =
        33, c = 0.33, f = 33, g = 10, h = 10, I = 10, j = 100, k = 100,
        and m = 1.0. The capacitors are 10 microfarads, except for the
        capacitors in the LC tuned circuits which are 0.001 microfarads,
        All coils are 10 millihenrys. </p>
      <p>The high-pas filters 16 and 18 may be of any suitable
        conventional circuit design, and may be a resistor-capacitor
        filter, a shortened delay line filter, or an inductor-capacitor
        filter, for example. The means for converting the filtered
        waveform to a square wave may also be any suitable conventional
        circuit such as a Schmidt trigger, or a very high gain amplifier
        which quickly saturates. </p>
      <p>A multichannel speech transmission system in accordance with
        the present invention is indicated generally by the reference
        numeral 60 in the schematic block diagram of Figure 3. In the
        system 60, the speech processor 10 is selectively connectable to
        any one of four filters 62-65 by a selector switch 66. The
        outputs of the filters 62-65 are connected to the input of a
        conventional single side-band transmitter 68. </p>
      <p>The filters 62-65 are narrow band-pass filters of any suitable
        conventional design having mutually exclusive pass bands of
        about 300 cycles centered at frequencies f1, f2, f3 and f4, and
        are grouped within a total bandwidth of about 1500 cycles, for
        example. Since 3000 cycles is a typical bandwidth for single
        side band transmitters operated for simple speech transmission,
        eight filters can be used if desired. The square wave produced
        by the speech processor10 may be selectively passed through any
        one of the narrow band-pass filters 62-65 without materially
        reducing its intelligibility. </p>
      <p>The filtered square wave is transmitted by the
        conventionaltrnamitter68 to a conventional single side band
        receiver 70.The output of the receiver 70 is selectively
        connectable through filters 72-75 to a power amplifier 78 by a
        selector switch 76.The filters 72-75 have corresponding
        passbands centered at frequencies f1, f2, f3, and f4. The
        amplifier 78 may drive a speaker 80. Therefore, if the selector
        switch 76 of a particular receiving set 70 is set to the filter
        corresponding in frequency to the filter selected by switch 66
        in the transmitter, the filtered square wave will be reproduced
        by the speaker 80 and will be sufficiently intelligible for
        nearly all voice communication purposes. However, if the
        selector switch 76 of a particular receiver is set to another
        frequency filter, no sound is produced by the speaker 80. Thus,
        the transmission system of Figure 3 provides four separate voice
        channels within the frequency band of 1500 cycles, or eight
        channels in the 3000 cycle bandwidth conventionally allotted for
        single side band operation. Of course,itisto be understood that
        the particular radio frequency is merely illustrative of the
        broader concept of the invention and that the same principles
        can be applied to transmissions through any media by electrical
        or electromagnetic waves. </p>
      <p>A secure system for transmitting scrambled voice communications
        is indicated generally by the reference numeral 100 in Figure 4.
        Again the speech processor 10 is used to generate the square
        wave as heretofore described., The square wave is then passed
        through a differentiator 102 which produces a sharp spike pulse
        in time correspondence to each transition of the square wave.
        The sharp spike pulses have a polarity determined by the
        polarity of the transition and are therefore passed through a
        fullwave rectifier 104 which converts all of the spike pulses to
        the same polarity. The spike pulses are then used to trigger a
        single shot multivibrator 106 which produces a pulse of
        predetermined amplitude and time width in response to each spike
        pulse. The uniform pulses from the single shot multivibrator 106
        are then passed through an encoder 108 which produces a
        plurality of pulses of corresponding width in a predetermined
        timed sequence in response to each input pulse. This may easily
        be accomplished by a plurality of parallel delay lines d0, d1,
        and d2 for transferring the pulses to point 110 at predetermined
        time intervals. The pulses are then amplified by an amplifier
        112 which drives a transducer 114. The transducer 114 may induce
        the pulses in water, in the earth, or in any other propagating
        medium. Or, if desired, the transducer 114 can be replaced by a
        radio or other electromagnetic wave transmitter. </p>
      <p>The transmitted pulses are received by an appropriate receiving
        transducer 116, which reproduces electrical pulses of
        corresponding width and amplitude. The received pulses are
        amplified by amplifier 118 and applied to a decoder 120. The
        decoder 120 is comprised of an identical number of delay lines
        of identical time relationship so that the three pulses are
        recombined as a single pulse summation point 122. Each time that
        the three pulses occur at the same point in time, the sum of the
        pulses exceeds the threshold of a detector 124 which triggers a
        flip-flop 126. The output of the flip-flop is then a
        reproduction of the square wave originally produced by the
        speech processor 10. This square wave is then amplified by
        amplifier 128 to drive a speaker 130 and produce the voice
        communication. Reproduction of the voice communication can be
        accomplished only if the receiving decoder matches the
        transmitting encoder. The encoders and decoders can be easily
        interchanged in order to maintain secure transmissions. </p>
      <p>Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been
        described in detail, it is to be understood that various
        changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein
        without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as
        defined by the appended claims. </p>

      <p class="caption">This fascinating technology was developed in
        1958 by Patrick <b>Flanagan</b>. It was thought that sound was
        only heard by the inner ear; <b>Flanagan</b>, however, was able
        to demonstrate that the brain also hears sounds that vibrate on
        the skin. </p>
      <p>To use this technology, you place the sensors on the forehead
        under a headband. Then plug the unit into your sound source,
        such as a CD player. The sensors cause your skin, the largest
        organ of the body, to vibrate to the music youve selected, much
        like a speaker vibrates. </p>
      <p>By bypassing the ear, you are using a completely different part
        of the brain to process the sound creating new neural pathways.
        This technology is great for concentration while studying,
        learning languages, assisting in new sound perception great
        for listening to music in a whole new way, helping with
        meditation, relaxation, and healing. </p>
      <p>When you first put the sensors on your skin, you feel a
        vibration and can actually hear the sound of the music youve
        selected. You can put the sensors on any part of your body, not
        just the forehead. </p>
      <p>Just by wearing the sensors, you will notice a dramatic mood
        shift making you more positive, and also a change in your brain
        power, producing unwavering focus! The ultrasound it produces
        sends high frequency sound waves and their harmonics beyond the
        hearing threshold to the brain. It is these high frequency
        sounds that actually energize the brain, giving you more energy
        and focus. For music lovers, the clarity of the sound will
        astound you. </p>
      <p>There are two products using this technology available, the <b>Neurophone</b>
        and the Echofone. Here are the differences: </p>
      <p><b>Neurophone</b> </p>
      <p>Portability makes it useful for: Listening to lectures in the
        classroom ~ Using at work for powerful focusing ~ Focusing at
        sporting events </p>
      <p><b>Echofone</b> </p>
      <p>Stereo Transducers makes it useful for: Serious musicians
        learning music ~ Music afficianados to experience incredible
        listening pleasure Sound therapy utilizing binaural beat
        frequencies </p>
      <p>The <b>Neurophone</b> operates on an internal rechargeable
        battery making it completely portable, not requiring a plug. The
        internal pink sound generator makes it easy to use on-the-go
        because you dont need to plug it into a CD player. </p>
      <p>The Echofone works in a similar manner, however is not
        portable. It is ideal however for music appreciation having a
        convenient control panel allowing you to easily mix the
        vibration intensity of the sensors with the volume intensity of
        the headphones. </p>

        ( 6/21/97 ) Freely distributed for informational purposes</center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Pat Flanagan's Neurophone, in its several versions, has
        been the subject of intense interest to many experimenters.
        Later embodiments of his device appear to be based on the
        observation that our neural systems are set up to receive and
        decode external stimuli as sharp, transient spikes which
        represent a conversion of smoothly-varying analog sound pressure
        waves into time-coded "digital" nerve impulses. The associated
        propagation delays most likely do with sound what our TV screens
        do with serially-sequenced video waveforms: Convert them into a
        spatial distribution across the TV screen as a picture (sound
        waves encoded spatially across the brain cortex as a
        spatio-temporal pattern). The Neurophone is a first attempt at
        performing this complex conversion from frequency- to
        time-domain. </p>
      <p>The idea of reducing full-fidelity speech/music into a
        differentiated, time-ratio coded version has many potential
        applications such as: </p>
      <p>* Compression of audio or other analog signals <br>
        * Artifical cochlea for "androids" <br>
        * Alternative sensory stimulus ("hearing" through the skin) a la
        Neurophone <br>
        * Induction of information to the brain without contact (e.g.,
        sharply-pulsed magnetic fields around the head such as
        Persinger's work </p>
      <p>After reading the many files available on the Neurophone's
        history and many embodiments, as well as building a few
        experimental circuits myself, I've come to the conclusion that
        the simple "clipper/double-differentiator"-type circuit, as
        described by Tom Bearden in his book "Excalibur Briefing", is
        lacking as an effective way to convert sound to time-coded
        pulses, for the following reasons: </p>
      <p>All sound waveforms (other than pure sine waves) are complex
        superpositions of several frequencies -- fundamentals and their
        harmonics, if they're periodic (pitched) sounds. The "tone
        color" is heavily dependent upon the&nbsp; relative amplitudes
        of the harmonics vs. the fundamental frequency. </p>
      <p>Vowels, or diphthongs, in spoken language, are essentially very
        specific bandpass-filtered spectra. The vocal cords produce a
        harmonic-rich, raspy buzz, analogous to a sawtooth or pulse wave
        as seen on an oscilloscope. The mouth and nasal cavities act as
        resonators to selectively filter the buzz from the voice box
        into recognizable vowel sounds. "Fricatives" such as the "ssss"
        sound are unpitched bursts of air, "filtered" through the teeth,
        lips, etc. Fricatives contain many high frequencies clustered
        around 6-9 KHz, whereas a male voice is usually pitched
        (fundamental) around 200 Hz. </p>
      <p>To run such a waveform into a clipper or squaring amplifier
        (comparator, Schmitt trigger) would be to take a very crude
        zero-crossing detection; the frequency with the largest
        amplitude is the fundamental... the higher harmonics "ride" upon
        it... so the fundamental is the frequency that gets to "call the
        shots" with the zero-crossing detector. So out comes a square
        wave, switching up or down through zero only at the grossest
        points of change along the waveform. We've already "hacked off"
        most of the "details"-- the information contained in the upper
        harmonics. </p>
      <p>Now if we differentiate, and then "double-differentiate" this
        clipped wave, we will get narrow pulses which "track" the edges
        of the original complex sound wave ONLY WHERE IT CROSSED THROUGH
        ZERO on the scope. The problem is, we've clipped all the good
        stuff -- the harmonics -- off, and lost much of the information
        in the process. The speech now sounds like a person talking
        through a "kazoo" -- amusing, but not very useful. </p>
      <p>How do we make square waves, and then narrow pulses
        (differentiated), out of a complex wave in such a way as to
        preserve DETAILED variations (upper harmonics)? </p>
      <p>INTEGRATE, COMPARE, DIFFERENTIATE, and SUM </p>
      <p>The method I am outlining here is a result of my own
        brainstorming on the problem; if I have stepped on anyone's feet
        by re-inventing your ideas, my apologies, but rest assured that
        I'm not looking for patent rights, just circuit functionality.
        Maybe I've discovered Flanagan's REAL method???... </p>
      <p>First, we need to appreciate the fact that there are millions
        of neurons doing their thing in our auditory system, not just a
        few. Accordingly, I'm going to outline a simple circuit that
        will produce time-coded spikes, but I'm recommending that
        several of the circuit modules be built and chained together
        SEQUENTIALLY (analog sections), with their differentiated SPIKE
        outputs all SUMMED together and perhaps clipped as a group so
        that there is one amplitude for them all, but varying repetition
        rates -- sort of like Pulse-Position Modulation but more
        complex. This is the output that will connect to the piezo skin
        transducers after suitable amplification. </p>
      <p>The cochlea has many, many neurons working on a serial sound
        "stream" at the same time. Some are positioned "up front" where
        the sound enters from the outside, some are down the trough a
        ways, and some are located at the far end. As such, there is a
        built-in time delay, or acoustic propagation delay, from one end
        of the membrane to the other. Carver Mead at Cal-Tech has
        attempted to model this by means of a series of transconductance
        amplifiers wired as simple delays with carefully-calibrated
        frequency "damping" per section. </p>
      <p>My version models this with a simple R-C lowpass filter
        (integrator) and an op amp (buffer) per module. The first stage
        or module will have the highest cutoff frequency, approximately
        5 KHz, and will set the resolution limit of the system. The
        output of the buffer, which reproduces the slightly low-pass
        filtered (and DELAYED) version of the original audio signal,
        goes on to the&nbsp; input of the next module. </p>
      <p>The next module's R-C filter has a slightly lower cutoff
        frequency, say, 3 KHz. And so on, down to maybe 200 Hz.
        (Probably best to taper the cutoff&nbsp; frequencies
        LOGARITHMICALLY for economy and accuracy.) </p>
      <p>Back to the first module, which had the highest cutoff
        frequency of the chain of modules we're building up... say,
        about 5KHz: </p>
      <p>Across the series resistor forming part of our RC filter, we
        tap off two wires and run them into a comparator (op amp with no
        feedback resistor... = squaring amplifier). The input side of
        the resistor (before being low-pass filtered) goes to the (+)
        input of the comparator; the other lead of the resistor (which
        connects to the filter cap and then to the buffer input) goes to
        the (-) input of the comparator. </p>
      <p>The comparator, therefore, constantly compares the two versions
        of the audio waveform at its terminals: the unfiltered/undelayed
        input vs. the filtered/delayed output side of the RC
        filter.&nbsp; When the input side is rising in amplitude, and
        exceeds the delayed output side, the comparator switches its
        output logic HIGH; when the input signal amplitude dips down
        below the delayed signal amplitude, the comparator switches LOW.
        THIS PRODUCES A VERY PRECISE "PEAK-CROSSING" DETECTOR WHICH
        TENDS TO SWITCH AT THE +/- PEAKS OF A SINE WAVE, rather than at
        the zero-crossings at the middle of the waveform. </p>
      <p>Now we run this squared-off comparator output into a
        DIFFERENTIATOR --- a series cap (about .001uf) and a resistor to
        ground (10k) -- which hi-pass filters the square wave into sharp
        spikes having approximately a 10 uS time constant, nice and
        short. We have now generated a series of bipolar spikes whose
        position, relative to one another over time, is a function of
        the DIFFERENCE of amplitudes and phases of two slightly
        different copies of the original incoming sound wave. </p>
      <p>A similar mechanism has been discovered within the retinal
        cells in the eye. Carver Mead has reproduced this one, too.
        I.e., a retina cell "computes" the [logarithm of the] DIFFERENCE
        between what it "sees" and what its immediate neighbors see --
        and it tries to inhibit their outputs, producing automatic EDGE
        DETECTION which can be thought of as spatially high-pass
        filtering a visual scene; the result is that CHANGING
        brightnesses are emphasized. Play with a kitten and you'll
        notice a direct proportion between how fast you pull the yarn
        past its visual field and how badly the kitten feels it "has to"
        pounce on it. And frogs tend to ignore everything except
        quickly-moving black spots (flies) across its visual field. </p>
      <p>This is likely the mechanism of neural coding by which we hear,
        also (or something like it). Living things tend to respond to
        CHANGES in sensory stimulus; long, monotonous stimuli lead to
        neural shutdown (boredom --&gt; sleep) as any school teacher can
        tell you. </p>
      <p>My version of Flanagan's Neurophone preserves several
        frequency-bands worth of harmonic information... but as
        time-domain spikes just as Flanagan says we need. And we don't
        hack the most interesting stuff off the top with this approach,
        like we do with simpler versions. </p>
      <p>INTEGRATE, COMPARE, DIFFERENTIATE, and SUM --&nbsp; A SUMMARY </p>
      <p>Visualise the human cochlea as a long delay-line with damping
        (low-pass filtering) progressing as you go down the line.&nbsp;
        Picture a comparator every few millimeters, with its two inputs
        slightly separated, "sampling" across a small section of the
        delay line as the waves propagate down the line. An entire array
        of such comparators, with their outputs differentiated into10 uS
        spikes, perhaps "OR'd" together, would present a highly detailed
        PPM spike-train which, I predict, would produce an increased
        efficiency in frequency-to-time or analog-to-digital sound
        conversion for the next generation of homemade Neurophone-like
        devices. </p>
      <p>HERE IS A QBASIC PROGRAM WHICH WILL RUN A SIMULATION OF THE
        ABOVE ON YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN.... drag your mouse across the
        following code, COPY it and SAVE AS a new file called
        COCHLEA1.BAS. Then, RUN it from your resident QBASIC
        environment. </p>
      <p>The program generates a rippled, sawtooth-like "audio" waveform
        (white) made up of a fundamental and 10 harmonics, and then
        samples it several times, each time having a slightly lower
        cutoff frequency (longer time delay, more low-pass filtering).
        This is displayed in yellow. </p>
      <p>The comparator output for each delay is plotted in green. </p>
      <p>The superimposed differentiated spikes from all the comparators
        are plotted at the bottom of the screen in white. </p>
      <p>Hope these ideas stimulate further research and development. </p>
