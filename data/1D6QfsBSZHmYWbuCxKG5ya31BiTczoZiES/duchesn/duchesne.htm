      <p>The esteem in which all of Europe held the late Sieur de la
        Violette, whose writings make him immortal as long as science
        has credit, has made me believe absolutely that what came from
        his hand could not be investigated with too much care or
        received with only general approbation. Heaven does not perform
        miracles every day, nor does Nature bring forth such great men
        of genius to whom she reveals her secrets. Here is the rarest
        she has, and I can say without boasting that nothing can be
        added to this compilation, as well as other writings issued from
        this same study, if you on your part evidence as much interest
        in this book as it has merits and as I have eagerness to serve
        you. Farewell. </p>

          Marvelous Solvent; Another Wonderful Solvent; another Solvent,
          Which is the Ardent Metallic Water</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>The True Preparation of Philosophical Salt for a General
          Solvent and a Universal Medicine ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take pebbles that are as white and lucid as those which are
        found along the Lake of Geneva and the banks of some rivers.
        Pulverize them coarsely, then put six parts of this with one
        part of Sun or Moon calx, made either with Mercury, with aqua
        fort, or some other way. Melt this mixture over a fire such as
        is used to make artificial stones, and your matter will be
        converted into a mass like a ball of glass, which pulverize
        subtly. After that, put your powder in a well-stoppered glass
        vessel and digest it in a sand fire for eight days. In this way
        the sulphur will burst forth sooner from the earth and will more
        easily sublimate. Accordingly, you will sublimate the sulphur of
        your materia in a well-luted and well-stoppered cucurbite, and
        when it is sublimated, you will separate it and keep it apart.
        (See Geber 's Liquor Silicis -- HW Nintzl, ed.) </p>
      <p>The earth that does not sublimate and stays at the bottom of
        the vessel is solid and black, but it will become beautiful,
        white and almost of the consistency of salt by means of the
        reverberation, in the course of which you will see it take on
        all kinds of colors. After this earth has been reverberated at
        your discretion, pour on it some excellent vinegar, macerate
        them together for 24 hours, and the vinegar will attract the
        salt that is in the earth and which is the true root of metals.
      </p>
      <p>Thereafter, separate the thus impregnated vinegar by
        inclination, and pour it again on the same earth which you had
        previously reverberated. Once more impregnate your vinegar and
        let it digest as before. Finally, separate this vinegar and
        again reverberate your earth, upon which you must pour some more
        vinegar. Proceed thus three or four times. Then separate all
        your vinegars, evaporate them at a slow fire till one-third has
        been consumed. Now put your glass in a cold cellar where small
        stones will be formed which can truly be called the
        Philosophical Salt of metals. This is a secret where the
        curiosity of so many philosophers has not been successful. They
        only found in it a shameful confusion after efforts that were as
        long as they were useless. </p>
      <p>After the last separation of the vinegar, take your earth,
        which you will still find moist, and put it in a humid place for
        4 or 5 weeks or more. From there, put it in a furnace over a
        fire of hot ashes or lukewarm sand, where lime is used [i.e.,
        solar lime or lunar lime; substitute calx for lime -- HWN] and
        you will see emerge from this earth the spirits or the salt
        flowers in the form of transparent crystals. Separate them
        carefully from your earth, dissolve them in vinegar, and if you
        evaporate one-third of this vinegar, you will make crystals as
        before. The earth that remains after the separation of the
        crystals must once more be wetted with some vinegar, so as to
        make it moist. Put it in a humid place for 4 or 5 weeks, as
        before, and from there remove it to a slow ash or sand fire, and
        salt flowers or crystals will form for, the second time. You
        must repeat this several times, as in this way the mineral salt
        will grow and increase from day to day. </p>
      <p>The same effect can be noticed in the vitriol mines or when
        working with saltpeter, for in this way salt is extracted every
        day from the earth of nitre and vitriol. This applies to the
        true salts extracted philosophically from Sol and Luna. Indeed,
        it is such an extraordinary secret that it would be criminal to
        despise it, since it is a medicine as sovereign as it is
        general, and which can unquestionably be considered the
        masterpiece of all chemical operations, because this salt
        dissolves immediately in every liquid no matter which, and by
        its admirable effect penetrates all kinds of bodies, dissolving,
        driving away, and healing anything malignant and injurious. </p>
      <p>The author seems to have touched on this point in the Treatise
        he has written on the Medicine of the Ancient Philosophers, when
        he speaks as follows: </p>
      <p>What door to the Garden of the Hesperides have I opened by
        speaking so clearly about saltpeter? What free access have I
        given to the stupid and ignorant which should only be given to
        scholars and lovers of the Muses? Therefore, in order to prevent
        your being deceived by taking my words literally, know that
        saltpeter or the fusible salt of the philosophers, which has at
        all braes given alchemy its name, is not common saltpeter.
        Nevertheless, its composition and its wonderful nature are like
        the patron or the Lesbian rule of our Work: After this, I can
        say that I have spoken more clearly and more openly than any of
        those who came before me. </p>
      <p><b>A Good Way to Freeze the Spirits of Brandy and to make a
          Chemical Concordance with an Astronomcal One, that is, to Join
          the Terrestrial Aquafortis with Aereated and Celestial Brandy
          (Water of Life), which is a Marvelous Solvent ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some vitriol of Cyprus or of Hungary, the latter being
        second in quality, 2 lbs; sublimated Mercury and common cinnabar
        or antimony, 1 lb each. Distill them in the usual manner. Take 1
        lb of this aquafortis and distill it again with fresh cinnabar
        or sublimated Mercury. Do this three times, removing the feces
        each time, until the water is quite clear. Put it aside and take
        care that it does not get spoiled from exposure to the air. This
        done, take 8 oz of the feces of the first aquafortis which
        contains the vitriol, put on it 1-1/2 lb marc weight of a very
        excellent brandy rectified 7 times. This is to be pulverized,
        well mixed, and put to digest in moisture in a well-closed
        vessel and distilled with a small fire to begin with. Then, at
        the end, use a strong fire till all the spirits have come out.
        Note that the feces of the aquafortis will be red as corals and
        will be reduced to vapors, even if you were using cinnabar of
        antimony. </p>
      <p>Take a large retort or a glass cucurbite immersed in cold water
        and attached with a cork or arranged in such a way that it can
        neither lean to one side nor to the other and stays immersed in
        the said water. After that, take two small even bottles and put
        into each of them 1 oz of these waters, filling them completely.
        Then put one after another in a vessel and you will see a great
        bubbling up. Let it settle and add to it two other phials of the
        same size as the others, full of the same water. Again the same
        bubbling will arise. Continue thus to gradually join all your
        waters to the last drop. Thereafter let it settle, and digest
        everything in the cold state for 24 hours: then distill your
        waters in the B. M.. They will leave you a salt at the bottom
        like ice or gum. Note that you must not distill to dryness, and
        the said salt must stay liquid. Now cohobate what you have
        distilled (by repeated distillations) till your distilled water
        has no more power and has left all its spirits conjoined with
        the salt, and then the work of your plant salt will be
        accomplished. Note that you must carefully store this weak water
        to use it for the dissolution of bodies. </p>
      <p>As to the salt, dry it very gently in a small retort, closed
        and stoppered in such a way that the spirits cannot exhale, and
        when your matter is dry, you must seal the retort hermetically
        to better preserve your salt. </p>
      <p><b>Another Wonderful Solvent ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take cinnabar of antimony, composed of even parts of crude
        antimony and sublimated Mercury driven through the degrees of
        the fire. With the first degree, a gum will appear, and with the
        second -- which will be a double fire above and below -- the
        materia will sublimate as much on the sides as on the neck of
        the retort. Thus you will produce a beautiful cinnabar, of which
        take 1 part; also 1 part each of vitriol and saltpeter. Put
        everything together in a retort with a long neck, on an
        ash-fire, till all the moisture is exhaled. </p>
      <p>Now stopper your retort well with cotton, continue the fire of
        your sublimation by degrees for 24 hours, and the matter will
        all sublimate into a mass white as snow, having the form of
        hair. Take this mass and imbibe it with oil of tartar on a
        marble or glass mortar till it turns into a soft paste. </p>
      <p>Put it in a big tall alembic to which its head is attached,
        lute it, and keep it in B. M. for 6 or 7 days, during which time
        your materia will turn into liquid Mercury. It is the Mercury of
        the sulphur of antimony and can pass through leather. </p>
      <p>Now add to this Philosophical Mercury an equal quantity of
        common Mercury that has not been prepared in any way. These two
        Mercuries, mixed together and put in a proper vessel, are put in
        the warm Horse's Belly for 6 days. Then distill them on an
        ash-fire, and the quicksilver will distill in the form of water
        which is the true mercurial water. Keep it separate. </p>
      <p>Thereafter take what is left at the bottom of the vessel in the
        form of a crystalline salt. Dissolve it in B. M. with some good
        brandy. What is left is a permanent and clear oil of
        quicksilver. Thus you will have two different liquids of
        mercurial oils, made in two different ways, which are the keys
        for opening the metals of the Sun and the Moon, of which you
        will be able to prepare the great medicines for the health and
        conservation of human bodies. </p>
      <p><b>Another Solvent, Which is the Ardent Metallic Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>Make an amalgam of 2 oz of tin with as much common Mercury, in
        the usual manner. Crush this amalgam with an equal part of
        sublimated Mercury, put everything into a glass in a damp place,
        and one part will turn into water in a few days. </p>
      <p>Amalgamate 6 oz of Saturn with 6 oz of common Mercury, to which
        add as much sublimated Mercury as the weight of the two
        together, that is, 12 oz; pulverize it and put it together with
        your tin paste. In a short time, the whole will dissolve into a
        soft paste covered by a cloudy water and mixed with some
        revivified Mercury. Press this partly sticky and watery solution
        through a cloth, by which you will separate the liquid Mercury.
        The rest of the cloudy water is to be put into an alembic to be
        distilled in sand. By giving fire by degrees, you will see some
        transparent water come out, which keep separate. Then, by
        increasing the fire, the rest of the materia will be abundantly
        sublimated at the head, like needles or tufts of wool, of a
        sweet taste, and this sublimate is the true Salt of Saturn. </p>
      <p>This downy and soft materia must be mixed with its water, and
        by means of repeated digestions and distillations an ardent
        metallic brandy (water of life) can be extracted from it, or
        this downy materia can be melted in a good spirit of wine
        (alcohol). Then you can put Salt of gold or silver in one or the
        other of these two waters, as much as your water can dissolve.
        Digest everything and observe the method by which the menstruum
        are made, that is, the rectifications and cohobations, to turn
        it into a metallic ardent water which will be a true natural
        solvent, for Nature loves Nature and rejoices in Nature, as the
        philosophers say. With these small crystals and the downy
        substance a great medicine can be made of it. It you imbibe this
        substance with oil of tartar and follow the way we have
        described above concerning the Mercury of antimony, you can even
        true your downy substance into liquid Mercury, which is still an
        admirable secret. </p>
      <p>In fact, I am giving you here many fine keys and open to you a
        field that is very favorable for further philosophizing. </p>
      <p><b>Another Universal Solvent, Called Philosophical Vinegar ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take 3 quarts of good vinegar, the strongest you can find.
        After distilling it twice, put it on 3 lbs of well-calcined salt
        of tartar, then distill it strongly to make it surrender all its
        spirits. By this you will draw out one-third of your materia
        which will be capable of dissolving pearls. Into the remaining
        two-thirds put another 2 lbs of salt of tartar and distill as
        above. </p>
      <p>As soon as you have distilled one-third, put it aside to be
        used later to dissolve coral and calcined antimony. Add yet
        another pound of fresh salt of tartar to the leftovers in the
        vessel, and distill again. Continue your distillation in this
        way to the end, till all your spirits have been drawn out. Then
        you will have a marvelous solvent for all kinds of calcined
        metals and for extracting their salts, oils, and even the
        Mercuries. Therefore, if you have dissolved some metal in this
        water and have extracted its salt, remember to distill two parts
        of it after the required digestions and to put the rest in a
        cold spot so that small pieces of ice may form, which you must
        separate by inclination. After that, wash them several times
        either with common water or with brandy, and finally try to
        resolve them by moisture, so as to transform them into oils. </p>
      <p><b>Philosophical Water for Dissolving the Two Luminaries ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take nitre and sal ammoniac, 1 lb of each: small river pebbles,
        pulverized, half a pound. Mix everything well and throw them
        into a glazed earthenware vessel, pierced on the sides, only, 1
        oz at a time. This done, immediately stopper the hole with a
        damp cloth. First the spirits will rise and the water will
        distill. After this, open the hole and throw in yet another
        ounce of your powder. Continue with this till you have a
        reasonable quantity of water which you must carefully preserve
        as, by an occult property, this water dissolves the two
        luminaries and turns one into a bright red and the other into a
        sapphire color. If you wish to get a fine oil from your
        dissolved salt, even redder than blood, you will do so
        successfully if you separate the water from it by a gentle
        distillation. Do this till you obtain an oily substance. Repeat
        this three times, always putting your water back into the
        vessel. It will finally come out without any taste, leaving, as
        I have said, the finest golden oil in the world at the bottom of
        the vessel. If you pour on it fresh water for the fourth time,
        you will see the solar oil rise very red and very beautiful
        through the alembic. To separate the phlegm of this last solvent
        from the oily substance, put everything in a cold cellar, and
        there small pieces of red ice-like crystals will form. Continue
        as long as that congealing takes place, for in this way you will
        more easily preserve the phlegm. Besides, as these crystals melt
        in common water, you can still pass them through the alembic and
        extract from them the tincture with the spirit of salt, which
        will leave the body of your gold at the bottom of your vessel as
        white as the Moon, and will give you an excellent tincture for
        all hopeless illnesses. </p>
      <p><b>A Solvent for all Kinds of Precious Stones ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some of the freshest quicklime, pulverize it coarsely in a
        glass vessel and pour upon it some excellent spirit of wine
        which must be without phlegm, test the cal be spoiled. Let it
        float over it by three or four fingers' breadth, then let it
        digest in the cold till the lime has absorbed the spirit of wine
        and is completely fermented by it. After that, cover the vessel
        with a head to separate in B. M. the spirit of wine, which will
        be sweet and almost insipid, because the cal will have retained
        the sal ammoniac of the spirit of wine. This done, put some more
        good spirit of wine on the marc at the bottom of the vessel and
        digest and distill as before, continuing doing this till the
        lime refuses to absorb more spirit of wine. It will be the sign
        that it has taken as much of it as it needs. You must distill
        the last imbibition at a slow fire, however, and this time the
        spirit of wine will come out as sharp and biting as it was
        formerly. As to the rest of the materia, put it together with
        its weight in bole or tripod, and distill everything with a
        strong fire, like that used to prepare the spirit of salt. In
        this way you will extract a very powerful solvent, capable of
        dissolving crystals, pearls, and all kinds of precious stones. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of Oils and Tinctures from Minerals ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some good pumice stone, the whitest that can be found,
        powder it subtly, then saturate it with some good distilled
        vinegar, and desiccate it. You must repeat this four times, and
        the last time you must reverberate it with a flame fire that
        must not be strong, to prevent it from melting. Now cement with
        this powder some laminae that are well rid of any metal
        whatever, even of the Sun, and this by stratification in a
        reverberation degree of the fire or of any other kind, for 24
        hours, and your powder will assume the color of the metal.
        Repeat this cementing till it has eaten away your metallic
        laminae. Now take your colored powders and put them five times
        in distilled vinegar vitalized with saltpeter, taking 4 oz of
        the said salt to 1 lb of this vinegar. Leave this vinegar and
        this salt to putrefy together in a retort, through which distill
        thereafter your vinegar with a strong fire, cohobating it till
        it has removed almost all the feces. When the vinegar has been
        thus prepared, put your colored pumice stone into it. It will
        lose all its tincture. Leave everything in the Horse's Belly for
        two weeks, and during this time your vinegar will draw out the
        color of your pumice stone: Then empty it and add other vinegar.
        Continue doing this till the extraction of the color is
        completed. After that, let your menstruum exhale in the bath,
        and it will leave the tincture of your metal at the bottom. If
        you wish to exalt it further, you will have to pour on your
        tincture some excellent brandy which you must putrefy so as to
        attract the soul of the metallic and mineral tinctures that you
        wish to obtain. </p>

        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>The Way to Make Potable Gold, According to the Method of
          Raymond Lully ~</b> </p>
      <p>The great secret of the books of Raymond Lully, Asillius, and
        Zacharius in regard to the quintessence is the extraction of an
        excellent distilled spirit of wine by means of the great vessel
        sealed with cork and paper, at a slow fire. </p>
      <p>When the spirit of wine has come out, the rest has to be
        distilled in large alembics till the feces begin to thicken. Put
        them aside in a clean vessel and continue your distillations
        till you have a large amount of spirit of wine, phlegm, and
        feces. Then take the feces which you have separated and put them
        into an alembic in a steam-bath to remove the rest of their
        moisture, so that they stay at the bottom of your receptacle
        like melted pitch. Put the feces that have been thus thickened
        back into another alembic, together with their phlegm which
        floats above them by four fingers' breadth. Keep them for four
        hours on a small fire to extract their tincture, consisting of
        combustible sulphur and the impurities of the wine. When your
        phlegm is colored, empty it gently by inclination, then put
        fresh phlegm on it and continue doing this till it is no longer
        colored and your earth is left white and crystalline at the
        bottom. If you should run out of phlegm, you can get some more
        by separating the colored substance from the tincture. When you
        do this, there will remain at the bottom some sulphur, or
        better, some blood red oil which you must carefully preserve.
        Note that this preparation of the feces could be made just as
        well with simple ablutions continued till their earth stays at
        the bottom in the form of lapilli, as it happens when you purify
        common tartar to make crystals thereof. </p>
      <p>The thus prepared feces are put into small long-necked
        cucurbits, together with their heads and receivers, which you
        must hermetically seal after pouring redistilled brandy on them.
        Boil and distill them for 6 hours on a small ash-fire, then put
        the distillate back into the vessel and leave it there for an
        hour. After this, empty all this liquid by inclination as
        carefully as you can, so as not to disturb anything. Now pour
        some more of your redistilled brandy over the feces, continuing
        doing this till they become black and no longer smoke on silver
        foil. To benefit from the waters that you have obtained from
        your earth by inclination, you must put them into carefully
        closed containers in a cold place, lest they evaporate, because
        this water is the animated Philosophical Water. </p>
      <p>Now gather up all your earths and put them in a sealed
        long-necked retort. Bury it in sand and calcine it at a
        medium-sublimation fire, keeping it in the athanor for 6 whole
        days, after which your earths will be white and very well
        calcined. Thereafter take your earth and divide it between two
        cucurbites of the proper size, upon which pour one-fourth of
        their weight of the animated water of which we have just spoken.
        After attaching the heads and receptacles, keep them first for
        one day in a lukewarm B. M., then put them for two days on an
        ash-fire, to distill them slowly. The water that will distill
        will be tasteless and powerless, having left its spirit and all
        its virtue to its calcined earth. Other animated water must now
        be put on it, always keeping the same proportion of which I
        spoke above, continuing the digestion at the B. M. and the
        distillation with ashes till each earth has absorbed its
        animated water and has become volatile. You will easily
        recognize it by the test of the red-hot silver foil, when you
        will see your earths go up in smoke. If they are not totally
        evaporated, the preceding operation must be repeated and
        continued till the substance is completely exhaled. In the
        opinion of the great Lully, the earth thus prepared is the true
        Sulphur and the true Philosophical Mercury. </p>
      <p>When you see on the foil that your earth has become completely
        volatile, put it into two small sealed alembics, together with
        their receptacles, and give them a slow sublimation fire for one
        day, increasing it by degrees till the 4th day, when the white
        fumes no longer appear in the vessel and your materia strongly
        adheres to the sides like foliated earth. It will be beautiful,
        clear, and transparent like pearls and talcum. Pulverize it in a
        small marble mortar and pour on it some distilled sulphurous
        spirit, not all at once but in gradual sprinklings. Finally, put
        it in a strong athanor for 3 or 4 days, during which time it
        will receive its perfect decoction and will turn into a pearly
        substance which will be the radical balsam of metals and each
        time an extract of a plant nature. </p>
      <p><b>Use of the Preceding Philosophical Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 2 or 3 oz of the earth of which we have just spoken and
        which is called Philosophical Sulphur, add to it 6 oz of
        excellent spirit of wine extracted as above, and put it in a
        long-necked retort. Heat it for 34 hours in the B. M., and when
        everything has turned into an azure-blue water, pour into it 5
        oz of prepared Sun which will suddenly dissolve, reddening at
        the same time the water of its solvent. After that, distill this
        solution 6 times in the Bath, each time pouring the water back
        on the feces. Finally, distill with an ash-fire, and your gold
        will rise with the water, leaving the Philosophical Sulphur at
        the bottom of the receptacle. Keep it for other dissolutions.
        Repeat once more the distillation in the B. M., and the tincture
        of the Sun will stay at the bottom of the alembic, together with
        the extracting agent, as a liquid and a precious oil which some
        alchemists dissolve again with the animated menstruum of the
        Philosophical Sulphur.and pass through the beak-head of the
        vessel, so as to turn it into true potable gold and a universal
        medicine. </p>
      <p><b>Another Use of the Same Philosophical Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>Dissolve in B. M. 4 oz of our Sulphur in 2 lb of the brandy of
        which we have spoken, then distill it on ashes. Pour 6 oz of
        this distilled water on 1 oz of calcined Sun, always adding
        fresh water, so as to obtain a complete dissolution. When it is
        done, circulate it in a Pelican in the Bath, or else in the
        Horse's Belly, for 40 days, and you will have a most precious
        liquid. If you separate the humor from it on a small ash-fire,
        your Sol will remain at the bottom of your vessel, like the
        other. </p>
      <p><b>Another Use of the Same ~</b> </p>
      <p>Reduce the Sun in Mercury and calcine it with common aqua
        fortis, extracting the water and pouring it back three times on
        the feces. To finish this work properly, put the feces in a
        crucible on live coal till they turn all red and do not smoke
        any longer. Then your gold is perfectly calcined or
        precipitated, and all you have to do is wash it several times
        with dew water. When this gold lime has been thus prepared, put
        it in a vessel and pour over it 4 times as much good brandy.
        Cohobate 7 times in B. M., the last time with a small ash-fire,
        after which your Sun, at the bottom, will be turned into as fine
        a liquid as the others, and even more subtle. </p>
      <p><b>Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Choose the best tartar of Montpellier and calcine it to perfect
        whiteness, but take care that it does not melt. Take 1 lb of the
        tartar thus prepared and pour on it 2 oz of very fine brandy.
        Then distill everything in an alembic in a steam-bath; and as
        the tartar retains in itself the spirits and the sal ammoniac of
        the brandy, your distillate will be tasteless. After this first
        distillation, you must pour on it 2 or 3 oz more of the same
        water and redistill as before, and you must continue distilling
        in this way little by little till your brandy comes out with the
        same strength as you had put it in, because that is a sure sign
        that your tartar has absorbed as much fire and spirits of the
        brandy as it needs. Being full of these volatile spirits, it can
        be elevated by sublimation into a substance which the
        philosophers call terra foliata (foliated earth). This done,
        take 4 oz of the thus alcoholized tartar and half a pound of a
        strong brandy, put them together and circulate them in a proper
        vessel. Then your brandy will take on the color of the sky and
        will be capable of dissolving gold in a perfect dissolution. In
        this way you will have a plant solvent that is less harmful that
        all the others. </p>
      <p>Before putting Sol in this solvent, it must be amalgamated with
        Mercury. This amalgam must be put into aquafortis where your Sun
        will calcine into an impalpable powder. Wash it well in order to
        remove the salt and the spirits which the aqua fort may have
        left with it. Now mix this calx with twice as much sublimated
        flowers of sulphur and put everything into two earthenware
        bowls. Your Sulphur will evaporate and leave a spongy and very
        subtle gold at the bottom. Put it into your heavenly water and
        set it in B. M., and you will surely see the dissolution of your
        gold in twice 24 hours. It will be the true potable Sol, not
        only suitable for ordinary diseases but even for all kinds of
        lepra. </p>
      <p><b>Second Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>First, prepare salt in the usual way. Take good tripoli and
        good brick, 2 or 3 lbs each, according to the size of your
        retort which must be made of good clay that can stand the fire
        without bursting. Put your materia into this vessel, subtly
        pulverized and mixed together. Know that your retort must have a
        hole at the back, opposite its neck and beak, so that a blowpipe
        can be put there and enter by two fingers' breadth to blow out
        the fumes of the salt in the body of the receptacle. You must
        also lute your retort with its receptacle which must be quite
        big and ample, such as is used to make oil of vitriol. Besides,
        you must put on a small stove a container filled with water,
        such as a small retort, which is called a small fire, increasing
        it every two hours, without using the blower while the spirits
        of the salt are rising of themselves. Use it only when they no
        longer pass and when the new spirit rises up in smoke. That
        spirit must be pushed to the bottom of the receptacle by the
        action of the blower, which you must continue to the end of the
        smoke. When all the spirit has passed (it can be recognized by
        the drops that begin to distill), it has to be rectified and
        separated from the water of the blower that has passed with it.
        When that is done, you will have a very white spirit, very fine,
        which you must keep apart in good phials of Lorraine, because it
        calcines the other glasses. </p>
      <p>After having thus extracted your spirit of Salt, take gold
        leaves and amalgamate them with twice as much common Mercury,
        previously purified with salt and vinegar. When your amalgam is
        thus made, put it in a small sublimating vessel to evaporate
        there half of the Mercury. Thereafter crush your amalgam in a
        glass or marble mortar, adding one quarter of the flowers of
        Sulphur. Put everything in a crucible luted with another.
        Mercury and the Sulphur will disappear, and your Sun will remain
        calcined. There are some who repeat this operation three times,
        but once is enough. </p>
      <p>Put this solar call in a long-necked retort of Lorraine glass,
        putting over it four fingers' breadth of your spirit of Salt,
        and set it to digest on hot ashes for one day. During this time
        your spirit will extract the tincture of Sol, and when it is
        well tinged with it, pour it into a retort by inclination.
        Again, put some of your spirit over the salt and leave it to
        digest as before till it is well colored. Then pour it together
        with the other into the same retort, and continue this procedure
        to the entire dissolution of your Sol and till you do not see
        anything at the bottom of the retort but white feces. </p>
      <p>Take your retort in which your colored spirits are gathered and
        put it on a small fire to distill slowly with three or four
        cohobations, till the spirits come out weak and without
        strength. Then take some fresh spirit and put it on the materia
        left in the retort. Distill several times as before until your
        Sol rises and goes over into the receptacle, together with
        spirit. Now decrease your fire and make it so small that your
        Sol cannot rise with the spirit but stays alone at the bottom of
        the retort as a red salt or a thick congealed oil. Finally it
        must be covered with so strong a brandy that it burns everything
        in the test. Dissolve your gold salt with that by putting then
        together to digest. If the dissolution is not complete the first
        time, repeat the process by keeping to that used for the
        operation with the spirit of Salt. </p>
      <p>When your last dissolution is done, distill your yellow brandy
        through the retort, and your tincture of Sol will rise, or at
        least after several repetitions. Note that if all of Sol did not
        rise after several distillations, it would be a sign that the
        spirit of Salt did not have the strength to decorporate as
        required, and you would therefore have to put some fresh spirit
        of Salt on the body of the gold, and again do as before. </p>
      <p>When Sol has completely risen, separate the brandy from it, and
        pass the same water three or four times over its body. Finally,
        it will remain by itself at the bottom of the vessel as a yellow
        oil, which has nevertheless the power to tinge red. </p>
      <p>Note that this gold solution mixes with common water without
        its body being revivified, that is, without reverting to its
        metallic body. </p>
      <p>To rid your solar oil of any tartness that the spirit of Salt
        may have given it, you must pour some oil of tartar on it, which
        will so well correct the strange taste of the Salt that your
        potable gold will be of such a sweet and pleasant taste as
        liquorice. </p>
      <p><b>Third Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Calcine gold three times with Mercury and Sulphur, in the
        manner about which we have already spoken. Take some excellent
        spirit of Salt, well prepared and rectified, to extract the
        tincture from your gold calx, because it is characteristic of
        the spirit of Salt that it extracts the Sulphur or the red
        tincture from this noble metal and leaves its white body at the
        bottom of the vessel. The infusion of this spirit into your
        materia must be repeated as often as necessary to complete the
        extraction of all of the tincture. Now bring all your liquids
        together in an alembic pot, to separate the spirit of Salt from
        them by distilling them to dryness. After this operation you
        will find at the bottom of your receptacle a very light and very
        red powder, almost like Mars saffron. Put it in a retort, pour
        some good spirit of vitriol over it, or rather some good oil
        distilled from all of the substance of the same mineral -- or at
        least from some that has been slightly calcined, redistilled,
        and digested to the point where it does not contain any feces,
        so that the oil is quite pure, quite tart, quite white, and
        quite clear. This oil will be such as is required to extract all
        the color from the crocus of our Sun, by the conjunction of
        which it loses all its tartness and becomes perfectly mild. Keep
        this oil of solar vitriol and depend on it as an extraordinary
        remedy, of which the dose of 4 or 5 drops in white wine or
        bouillon does wonders for the cure of the strangest diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Fourth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take hold and dissolve it in the Philosophical Water that
        dissolves the two luminaries and which is composed of nitre and
        sal ammoniac, as we said above. After thus dissolving your Sun,
        distill the solution to the consistency of syrup. Then pour some
        more Water on and distill again as above, doing this three
        times. You will see that the waters come out of the alembic
        insipid, as they leave there their spirits with the body of the
        Sun. </p>
      <p>But in order to pass the Sun through the retort or the alembic,
        some fresh solvent must again be poured on it which, animated by
        the solar spirit, will do admirable thing for the health, and
        especially for the cure of lepra. </p>
      <p>Having thus calcined your gold, throw it into common water
        together with its solvent, and when everything is mixed, put
        some Mercury into it. It will cause an Eclipse of the Sun, if
        you digest it cold for some time, as it will attract all of the
        solar body. Separate the water from it by inclination and wash
        the amalgam of these two bodies several times to soften their
        tartness and to separate all the spirits from the Philosophical
        Water. </p>
      <p>Having done this, press the Mercury through a leather in which
        your solar calx will stay behind as an amalgam. Put it in the
        fire, that is, in a flat basin, to let the Mercury evaporate,
        and you will be left with a calx of crocus or solar cinnabar,
        impalpable and quite red. From it the tincture of the Sun can be
        extracted with some spirit of Salt, and of the spirit of Salt
        saturated with this tincture give three or four drops, which
        will do wonders for all inveterate diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Fifth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Distill some good spirit of vitriol and pour it over Jupiter on
        a strong ash-fire, and you will extract from it the most
        beautiful yellow water in the world. Leave it for a whole night
        in an open bottle. The following day, pour it on gold leaves put
        at the bottom of a glass alembic, and add to it an equal amount
        of very fine brandy which must be at least half dephlegmatized.
        Now distill your brandy in B. M., then your solvent on ashes, in
        the same alembic. If your Sol has not yet turned into oil at the
        bottom of your receptacle, pour some more of your solvent and
        your brandy on it. Repeat this till your gold turns into oil
        with the first force of the solvents. On this oil put the
        solvent alone, without the brandy. It will take on the color of
        the oil which has many uses, as it is given for all diseases of
        the lungs, the stomach, and the heart, in short, for all kinds
        of illnesses and infirmities. One spoonful or half a spoonful is
        given, according t the strength of the sick person. It is also
        excellent for the prolongation of life and the prevention of all
        kinds of diseases if one of these doses is taken during three
        days in bouillon or otherwise. This liquid is so harmless that
        it can even be given to three-day old babies. If you wish to
        give it in the form of oil, take only one drop in bouillon or
        distilled melissa. </p>
      <p><b>Sixth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take honeycomb of the month of May, of a good consistency, put
        it in a well-stoppered retort and let it stand for 20 days. Then
        put it in B.M. and keep it there for 5 days, after which it will
        be pure and flowing. When in this state, press it through a
        cloth and distill the strained matter three times in a small
        alembic on a slow fire. In addition, powder some gold leaves on
        a marble slab. Take 1 oz of it, upon which pour 4 oz. of your
        honey water in a retort. Keep it well closed in B. M. for 10
        days, and during this time a wonderful oil will form out of the
        quintessence of the honey and the gold. To do this perfectly,
        put it in an alembic to convert your Sun into calx by
        distillation on an ash-fire. Now wash it carefully several times
        with pure well water and three times with dew water. In short,
        put some good brandy on this purified calx and distill
        everything in B. M. in the same alembic up to 7 times. In this
        way your metal will be radically turned into oil which will in
        fact be turbid, but you can also purify it first by fire and
        then by dew water, to make it suitable for the preservation of
        health and the cure of many diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Seventh Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Calcine pumice stone in the most recent dew water you can find,
        and make a cement of the powder of this stone with the gold
        call, prepared with aquafortis, or salt, or Mercury, as you
        learnt before. Put your cement for 24 hours in a reverberation
        fire, and in this fire your Stone will extract a purple color
        from the Sun, which is no other than the true tincture of gold.
        Powder this colored stone and then pass it through a very fine
        strainer. To separate the substance of the gold from that of the
        pumice stone, pour some fine brandy over all this powder which
        you have rectified by distilling it over excellent honey of
        Narbonne. Your water will attract all the tincture, provided you
        give it several infusions of brandy till it no longer gets
        colored. When the tincture has been thus extracted from these
        waters, separate it by a gentle distillation to the consistency
        of oil. You will be left with a potable tincture whose color
        will be enhanced as it ages. Give one drop of it on a tablet of
        sugar, or in wine or bouillon, and you will restore the life of
        invalids. </p>
      <p><b>Eighth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Get some good Roman vitriol, or rather vitriol of Cyprus or
        Hungary, and put it in a glazed earthenware pot on an ash-fire
        to let the moisture of the vitriol evaporate. To finish
        calcining it well, put it in a well covered and well-luted
        earthenware pot on a live coal fire, where it has to stay for
        less than 4 hours to allow it to calcine perfectly. If it does
        not look calcined enough, cover the pot once more and put it
        back on the fire till it becomes as red as blood. After this
        preparation, without which this work cannot be accomplished, put
        the vitriolic cal, called colcothar (the caput mortuum!) into a
        well-luted retort on a reverberation fire. You will extract
        three substances, the last of which will be the oil, of which
        there will only be very little. Into this oil of vitriol, which
        you will pour into a small alembic pot, throw the gold leaves
        folded into rolls and keep them on the fire for one hour or
        more, to be dissolved and made potable. And while these leaves
        are thus being dissolved, pour on them some oil of cloves and
        camphor, that is, to 2 oz of oil of vitriol, for instance, take
        1 oz of oil of cloves and 1 oz of prepared oil of camphor, as we
        will tell you below. You will notice that as soon as you have
        mixed your oils of cloves and camphor with the vitriolic
        solution of your gold, the receptacle will get heated and a
        great boiling will arise due to the antipathy of the spirits of
        these three oils. While this is taking place, put your
        substances in the cold, and when they have somewhat recovered,
        you can put them *on the fire to distill and to successively
        separate these three liquids, the last of which to be distilled
        being the oil of gold and the true potable gold. </p>
      <p>Regarding the usable oil of camphor of which we have spoken, it
        is made as follows: Take camphor, pulverize it and dissolve it
        on a slow fire in oil of sweet almonds. When it is completely
        dissolved, pour on this oil a reasonable amount of good spirit
        of wine, and then pass everything through the beak of an
        alembic, on a sand-fire. Your oil of camphor will come out
        beautiful, clear, and quite suitable for the above-mentioned
        operation. </p>
      <p><b>Ninth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take good pulverized candied sugar, melt it on fire, then
        imbibe glowing bricks with it. When they are well imbibed, put
        them in a retort or in an alembic to be distilled on a slow
        fire. Then you will obtain a very efficacious oil. Not only can
        its acridity dissolve several solid bodies, but even the body of
        the Sun, if prepared with Mercury, aqua fortis, and Sulphur
        sublimated according to the Art, can easily be dissolved when it
        is put to digest for some time in B. M. or in the Horse's Belly.
        Finally, it can turn into oil if the liquid of the sugar is
        gently distilled in the same bath, which leaves behind it the
        oil of the Sun or the potable gold, the easiest and most
        harmless potable gold that our Art has yet prepared. </p>
      <p><b>Tenth Method of Making Potable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 oz of gold and 16 oz of Regulus of antimony. Melt the
        Regulus, and during the fusion, throw the Sun on it". Leave them
        together on the fire for a quarter of an hour, without blowing.
        At the end of this time, remove your materia, powder it, and put
        it into two crucibles, well sealed, lest your materia, powder
        it, and put it into two crucibles, well sealed, lest something
        might escape. Leave it for a whole day on the fire of a wind
        furnace, and such a fire will cause your materia to become
        almost black. Let it cool and crush it thereafter. Then put it
        on the furnace and increase the fire. If the materia can be
        easily crushed, it is a sign that the cement must be renewed and
        the 4th degree of fire be given. In this way you will obtain a
        fine white powder, upon which you must pour distilled vinegar.
        It will extract as brown color from this powder by means of the
        digestion, and if you distill it in the Bath, there will be left
        at the bottom of your vessel a red oil, almost of the color of
        rubes. </p>
      <p><b>Another Gold Oil, According to the Special Method of the
          Sieur de la Violette ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 2 lbs of melted salt, 1-1/2 lbs of fine saltpeter, remelt
        everything in a big crucible, and throw on it 1 lb of pulverized
        Tripoli, stirring the materia well. Then put it in a marble
        mortar and pulverize it completely. Note that if you can obtain
        some of those white pebbles from the Lake of Geneva of which we
        have already spoken, or some of those transparent flints,
        calcined and pulverized as is usually done by throwing them into
        the water, those things, I say, would be much better than the
        tripoli. Proceed with this mixture as above, extract the spirits
        through an earthenware retort, as is done with those of the aqua
        fortis. This water, which may be called the spirit, or rather
        the quintessence of common salt and niter, must be rectified in
        B. M. with 10 or 12 cohobations, putting the distillation over
        the marc, so as to extract from it that part of the water that
        does not have any characteristics at all of the nature of the
        Fire and which is called the watery phlegm. This operation must
        be continued till, for example, there is only half a pound or a
        little more left of 2 lbs of liquid. Then your spirit is
        marvelously purified, heavy, and separated from all its
        superfluous wateriness. </p>
      <p>This done, take one part of the Regulus of antimony prepared
        with Mars, and 2 parts of sublimated Mercury. Pulverize them and
        put them together in a retort to extract from them a gummy
        liquid. Dissolve it in moisture, and redistill it again through
        the retort to extract from it a clear and heavy oil like
        Mercury. This will be happily accomplished, provided you
        separate the first moisture during distillation. </p>
      <p>This clear and dephlegmatized oil is put into a suitably large
        retort, and the spirit of Salt, which you had previously
        preserved, is also put into the receptacle. Then join the retort
        to its receptacle; lute them together t he prevent anything from
        escaping. Give a sand-fire by degrees, and you will extract a
        mercurial liquid form the retort. Falling upon the salt, it will
        cause a big and strange effervescence, of which you must not be
        surprised. This distillation finished, remove the receptacle all
        at once and pour cold water into it to somewhat restrain the
        great ardor of the spirits. Afterwards, put them into a small
        alembic together with its head and its receptacle. Placed on
        cold sand, the materia will distill during three days without
        fire, after which you can give fire to finish the distillation
        of the liquid. However, you will observe that a white powder
        will rise which you must put aside for other uses. As to the
        mercurial liquid, pour it into strong well-stoppered bottles,
        carefully buried in wet sand, lest it evaporate because of the
        great fire by which it is animated. </p>
      <p>In addition, prepare a philosophical water of sal ammoniac and
        saltpeter, as I showed you above. Into 4 oz of this water pour
        at most 15 drops of your mercurial water, which will be an
        extractor for drawing out the tincture from one oz of gold,
        amalgamated with two parts of Regulus. When it has extracted all
        the tincture, separate it gently by inclination, and add again
        so much that only a white body remains. Do this in B. M. with
        very low heat. </p>
      <p>Collect all these colored waters and distill in the Bath what
        is most clear. Put the rest in a retort, drive it, and finally
        give it strong fire, so as to sublimate the Sun at the neck of
        the retort. It will be brilliant and radiant like a ruby and
        will turn into an oil whose uses are admirable. </p>
      <p>If you put equal parts of the said mercurial water and oil of
        vitriol or of sulphur together and extract the liquid through a
        retort, you will have an oil that coagulates in the cold and
        dissolves in a warm hand or in any other low heat, and is
        suitable for dissolving the Sun and the Moon. </p>
      <p><b>Essence and Tincture of Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Make an aqua regia with common salt, or sal ammoniac, or spirit
        of Salt. Add to 12 oz of this water 4 oz of specially prepared
        sublimate, which has been sublimated 7 times in the same way it
        was sublimated the first time, that is, it must be mixed with
        fresh vitriol in the usual proportion, so that it is completely
        saturated with it. Having thus mixed these things, let them
        digest together for 4 or 5 days, then distill and drive the
        spirits till the Mercury sublimates. If you carry this operation
        out like a good artist, you will have very excellent mercurial
        water which dissolves and opens Sol wonderfully well, for it you
        put gold into it- keeping everything in putrefaction three
        times, each time separating the phlegm from the solvent your
        materia will be well opened. To open it to the utmost degree,
        however, some fresh mercurial water must be poured over your
        materia, and it is even necessary to cohobate it up to three
        times. After this, give a good sublimations fire, and you will
        see your Sun rise over your alembic, red as blood, exalted,
        volatile, and well suited to turn into, tincture with the help
        of the alcoholized animated vegetable spirit, and capable of
        achieving the last exaltation of gold. You could also make it
        with the same aqua regia if instead of the sublimated Mercury
        you took the same amount of gum and mercurial oil that is
        extracted when making the Mercury of life, and proceeded as
        above till your Sol became volatile, for it is in this that the
        whole secret of this operation consists. After extracting your
        solar tincture in this way, you will get ahead even more by
        adding to 3 parts of this volatile gold 1 part of Mercury of the
        same luminary, extracted with revivifying salts. Thus you will
        obtain a perfect medicine, the effects of which are sovereign
        and infallible for all diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Sudorific Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Make an aqua regia in the usual way, and in this water dissolve
        gold leaves or filings, or gold in small laminae. Then pour upon
        it, drop by drop, your solution of a fine oil of tartar made by
        the dissolution of its salt. All at once, a great effervescence
        will arise from the union of these two liquids. This shows that
        your oil of tartar must not be poured on in one go, but only
        drop by drop, as we have said, making small effervescences each
        time. Continue in this way till the materia no longer bubbles
        up. Put the container with your materia in a cold place for a
        while, and your calcined Sun will precipitate to the bottom of
        the vessel. When you see it in this state, pour all the water
        off, gently, by inclination, and wash the residues with warm
        water. After that, dry them in the heat of the sun or in a
        drying closet, in such a way that the materia cannot burst into
        flames, because, being dry, it is as easily ignited as gun
        powder, not only by the least bit of heat but even simply by
        motion. This happens at the bottom, contrary to gun powder which
        pushes upward. This is so much so that if you were to put some
        of this powder on a very thick piece of wood and set fire to it,
        it would make such an effort that it would pierce the wood
        completely. Therefore, one could do wonders with it, if it were
        easy to carry it without it going up in flames, which it does by
        simply being disturbed. </p>
      <p>Such is the solar materia with which the philosophers teach us
        to compose the great Sudorific which they call Burning Gold and
        which they use with precaution and in the following manner. Take
        4 or 5 grains of your gold calx, put it in a silver spoon filled
        with a fine spirit of wine. Thereafter, set fire to it while
        keeping the spoon quite straight. By covering it with a
        bell-shaped glass, sublimate your Sun. During this sublimation
        you will observe a small noise and a small dark cloud around the
        glass. Seeing this, put some more brandy on the same powder and
        continue as before repeating the same operation for a whole day,
        so as to obtain a reasonable quantity of your sublimated Sun,
        which will be of a very subtle consistency and sky blue. Scrape
        it with feathers and preserve it Carefully. If you give 2 or 3
        grains of it on sugar or jam or in a suitable liquid, you will
        purge the sick in an extraordinary way by a thick and unctuous
        perspiration, which will drive away all kinds of putrid fevers
        and pestilences, and even the most stubborn and lamentable
        diseases. </p>
      <p>I have several times observed that this gold powder, before
        being sublimated and without any preparation other than that of
        being simply precipitated with oil of tartar, is an incredible
        remedy for pestilences, if one gives a few grains 24 hours after
        being attacked. It drives away the poison through the
        perspiration, and is quite successful, provided one rests in bed
        and does not move. </p>
      <p>Besides, if you consider the great effects of this solar calx
        and the ease with which it catches fire, you will perhaps think
        that it would be suitable to make the Philosophical Fire, which
        the Trevisan (Bernard of Treviso) valued so much, and which he
        kept so secret. </p>
      <p><b>Purgative Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some oil made of equal parts of purified antimony,
        sublimated Mercury, and oil of salt extracted in the usual way.
        Put them together in accordance with the Art, then distill them,
        and put some gold into the liquid that you extract from them.
        You will see it dissolve all of a sudden. This liquid, or
        solution of the Sun, is mixed with a little sugar or some good
        tasting jam, and it will do admirable works if you give of it at
        your discretion according to the age and the strength of the
        sick. If the liquid of this gold solution is drawn through the
        alembic, a powder will be left at the bottom of the vessel. As
        it retains the mercurial virtues of antimony and the sublimate,
        it can be given, either in substance or as an infusion, as a
        purgative medicine, after it has been sweetened. </p>
      <p>Or, if you precipitate the whole solution into cold water as
        soon as it is prepared, you will make of it a coagulate that is
        much more excellent than the usual ones, because it will contain
        the gold calx. Having been made milder by various ablutions, it
        will be a great purgative remedy, whether you give it in
        substance or as an infusion with some suitable liquid. </p>
      <p><b>Gold of Life ~</b> </p>
      <p>Gold of Life, or Life Gold, is made with 1 part of pure gold
        and 4 parts of Mercury, amalgamated and dissolved together in
        common aquafortis, because Mercury dissolves in that water and
        the Sun is precipitated into powder. Now distill the aquafortis
        to dryness, so that everything may precipitate to the bottom.
        Put fresh aquafortis, on the dry matter, distil again, and
        repeat this two or three times. Finally, pile this substance to
        calcine it completely. To drive away all the sharpness of the
        aqua fortis, wash your call first with spring water, then with
        fine brandy, and you will have a miraculous precipitate. If you
        give of it only one or 2 drams, with 2 drams of essence of aloe
        and as much essence of myrrh, separately extracted, and one dram
        of essence of theriac, you will drive away the plague, inducing
        abundant perspiration, and you will make a purgative and
        sometimes a most excellent emetic. </p>
      <p>If one wishes, one can. extract a salt or a very fine essence
        from this solar precipitate if, after softening it by several
        ablutions with common water, one puts it to digest for some time
        in vinegar. You can prepare an excellent medicine from it. After
        precipitating it with oil of tartar -- as must be done to
        extract its essence -- soften it yet more with common water, and
        finally with good spirit of wine. </p>
      <p><b>Vegetable Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 dram of gold filings or gold calcined in any way you
        like, and 3 drams of lunar filings or lunar calx, 12 oz of
        Mercury of common cinnabar or of cinnabar made of antimony and
        sublimated. Put everything together in a big retort, and after
        stoppering it only with cotton, put it on a fire of moderate
        heat. You will see your materia grow from day to day in the form
        of leaves or sheets, and it will happen in less than 3 weeks,
        and will give you as much pleasure as amazement on seeing it.
        You will be able to turn it into a fine composition for health.
      </p>
      <p><b>Calcined Philosophical Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Amalgamate 1 oz of gold with 7 oz of well-purified Mercury,
        stir them well on the fire with a stick, and after removing the
        materia from the fire, continue stirring it for a quarter of an
        hour. Then throw it into a bowl of cold water. After this, wash
        your materia with vinegar and water, then dry it in a clean
        cloth, and finally put it into 1 lb of gold aquafortis, keeping
        it in a retort above the fire till the Mercury is dissolved and
        your gold fails to the bottom as cola or impalpable powder. Put
        the latter in another retort with vinegar and boil it there for
        6 hours. After that, pour the vinegar off and replace it with
        water which must again stay on the fire to sweeten your
        substance. Continue putting fresh water on it till all the
        spirits of the aquafortis are out. Thereafter, mix your powder
        with 6 oz of good prepared common salt, put it in a crucible
        covered by another pierced crucible, and set it in a small
        furnace filled with live coal. Keep it there for 24 hours, then
        let the fire die above the crucibles. Finally, separate the salt
        with several ablutions of boiling water, and your gold will be
        left pure and clean, prepared and calcined according to the
        method of the philosophers. </p>
      <p>Here you have several good methods of extracting the spirits of
        gold and the tinctures, and to turn them into a potable essence.
        We could glue you several further descriptions which are
        contained in the writings of your author, who knew (as he
        himself says in his tetrade) more than 50 methods, but we will
        merely present these here, with the promise that we will soon

      <p><b>A Good Preparation of Luna for the Diseases of the Brain ~
          Another Preparation ~ Moon Oil ~ Moon Mercury ~ Calcination of
          Luna</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>A Good Preparation of Luna for the Diseases of the Brain ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>To prepare the Moon and to make of it a suitable remedy against
        the worst diseases of the brain, it must be calcined
        philosophically and then dissolved in fine oil of Cyprus, which
        alone has the power to liquify perfect metals without the help
        of saltpeter. When you have dissolved the Moon, evaporate or
        distill half of the dissolved materia and put the rest in a cold
        place, where small pieces of Moon crystals will form. You can
        dissolve them in oil of sage, and use them for mental
        derangement and other illnesses of this nature. </p>
      <p><b>Another Preparation ~</b> </p>
      <p>A certain philosopher friend of mine and a great personality
        prepares an excellent remedy with the Moon in the following way:
        He calcines silver laminae with sulphur, putting them layer upon
        layer in two crucibles, careful that the sulphur does not
        ignite. To make the sulphur become black as coal, he separates
        it from the Moon filings with water, and afterwards finds his
        filings black calcined and ready to turn into a subtle cal when
        ground in a mortar. When he has prepared this calx, he puts it
        in a retort and pours some water over it. Then he distills and
        cohobates several times. He says that in this way the spirit of
        the Moon goes over partly with the water, and if only a few
        spoonfuls of this water are given to patients suffering from
        mental troubles, melancholy (depression) of other infirmities of
        the brain, they provide wonderful relief. </p>
      <p><b>Moon Oil ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take laminae of the Moon cut into small pieces, and dissolve
        them in aquafortis rectified with salt of tartar or composed of
        the same salt. When your Moon is dissolved in this water, pour
        some good brandy on it and then let it stand for 24 hour's in a
        cold and humid place. During this time, some small crystals will
        form at the bottom. In addition, take some whites of egg,
        distill them, and in this distilled water digest your crystals
        for 2 or 3 days. </p>
      <p>Then put everything into an alembic, distill in the Bath, and
        at the bottom of the vessel a very precious silver oil will be
        left. </p>
      <p><b>Moon Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Moon Mercury is extracted in various ways. Sometimes long
        and tedious triturations of common Mercury with the Moon are
        used till everything passes through a chamois leather in the
        form of quicksilver. Sometimes silver calx is used, made with
        common Mercury imbibed with oil of tartar and vinegar animated
        with sal ammoniac. It is afterwards revived by the hot water
        that separates the salts from the Moon calx, causing the Mercury
        to appear. This method is much better than that of the
        putrefactions performed by others in the reviving salts, which
        they sublimate afterwards. Actually, the Moon Mercury can well
        be extracted in this way but only in very small amounts. </p>
      <p>To extract Mercury more easily from silver, take very thin
        silver laminae, put them in a retort and pour on them a plant
        resuscitator calcined to whiteness, and on this put some Flying
        Eagle and sal ammoniac. The proportion is such that on 3 oz of
        Moon laminae enough plant resuscitator is put to cover the
        laminae, also 3 oz of Flying Eagle and 1-1/2 oz of sal ammoniac.
        Put everything in an earthenware pot on a fire which you must
        control according to the Art. You will find at the bottom your
        completely corroded Moon which will have left you 2 oz of liquid
        Mercury, or at least 1-1/2 oz, if you work regularly. </p>
      <p><b>Calcination of Luna ~</b> </p>
      <p>Amalgamate 1 oz of cupeled Luna filings or sheets with 8 oz of
        purified Mercury. Grind this with common salt prepared in one
        hour in a Wooden mortar, then remove the salt with ablutions of
        common water. This done, grind the same materia again for 1 hour
        with very clean simple water. After that, put salt in the water
        and grind this amalgam again for 1 hour. Repeat the same thing
        with water alone, then with-salt, continuing this process up to
        20 times. The last time, leave the salt and put everything in a
        big crucible on live coal, stirring and grinding this mixture
        continually till the Mercury is completely exhaled from it.
        Finally, wash the remaining substance with warm water to purify
        the salt, and you will find at the bottom of your vessel a very
        subtle Moon calx, very white, and such as must be the
        Philosophical calx of metals. </p>

          Tincture of Mars ~ Salt or Crystals of Mars</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Iron Called Crocus Martis ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take steel filings or very thin sheets and pour urine or common
        water on them. In a short time rust will form over the matter.
        As soon as you see it appear, throw your steel into boiling
        water which will attract all the rust if you stir the water for
        some time with your hands, as by such stirring you will separate
        what is most subtle. Do this several times to remove a good
        amount of the rust. Now take this materia and put it in a
        crucible in a wind furnace, and suddenly your Mars will get red.
        It will be very easy to dissolve it in an aqua fortis made of 2
        parts of vitriol, 1 of common salt, and 2 of bole. If you leave
        your red steel in this water for 4 or 5 days, it will dissolve
        completely. If you separate the water from it with the alembic
        and raise the fire at the end, your salt will without fail
        sublimate and, put in a humid place, will turn into a very
        precious red oil. </p>
      <p><b>Regulus of Mars ~</b> </p>
      <p>The Regulus can be prepared in various ways, but this one is
        considered the best: Take 4 oz of horse-shoe nails, put them in
        a crucible on a fierce fire to bring them to a red heat, then
        pour on them 8 oz of antimony with a little saltpeter, and all
        this will easily melt into water without the addition of tartar,
        as is usually done. Now break the crucible, and you w <br>
        find the Regulus at the bottom. Melt it once more with 1 oz of
        saltpeter, then melt it again twice, and you will find 4 or 5 oz
        of very fine Regulus which will bear the impression of the star
        of Mars. </p>
      <p><b>Tincture of Mars ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some of the aforesaid Regulus of Mars, any quantity you
        like, and with Etampes sand or pumice stone, prepared in the way
        we have already indicated, put layer upon layer in a lured
        crucible. Then put it to calcine on a reverberation fire for 24
        hours. When cold, powder all your materia and pour good white
        vinegar on it to extract its tincture, which will make your
        vinegar bright red and the most beautiful in the world. Give one
        spoonful of it in bouillon to women suffering from leukorrhea or
        the flux of maternal blood. This same remedy is also useful for
        stopping all kinds of hemorrhages and overflowings of the blood.
        With this Mars Regulus all metals can be adjusted to extract
        their tincture according to the method which we have prescribed,
        so as to make of it a remedy for an infinite number of diseases.
      </p>
      <p><b>Salt or Crystals of Mars ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some clinker, powder it as subtly as possible, then
        reverberate it for 24 hours and pour on it some good distilled
        vinegar to extract the salt or the crystal from your materia.
        When your extractor is colored, pour it off by inclination and
        replace it with some fresh. When you have enough tinged vinegar,
        distill it to dryness, and you will find a yellowish substance
        at the bottom of your vessel, which is the desired salt. You
        can, if you wish, make it as white as snow by again pouring
        fresh vinegar on it and letting it digest and distill as before
        till your salt is quite white and crystalline, and the vinegar
        comes out as tasteless as water. If you give 1 or 2 spoonfuls of
        this water and about 5 or 6 grains of this salt, you will
        produce an incredible effect against jaundice, dropsy, cachexia
        (general debility), chlorosis or greensickness, and other
        similar diseases. What appears to be most wonderful is that this
        operation is done without. Violence and does not manifest by any
        other effect than that of the urine. </p>

          Venus</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>The Way of Extracting the Vitriol of Venus ~</b> </p>
      <p>The vitriol extracted from copper is considered by all
        philosophers the best of all, as much for human as for metallic
        bodies. </p>
      <p>The method of extraction requires that one take the best copper
        calcined with sulphur, or some verdigris, or good aes ustum. One
        or another of these three prepared coppers is put in vinegar to
        extract its salt and crystals. Thereafter, the vinegar is
        evaporated to dryness. The materia left at the bottom of the
        vessel is what is called the vitriol of Venus. <br>
        It can be further prepared. Sometimes its oil is extracted,
        which is chiefly used for the precipitation of the Mercury of
        Venus. When the latter is precipitated, it serves as an
        excellent sudorific and bezoardic against all kinds of
        pestilences when only one or two grains are given. </p>
      <p><b>Mercury of Venus ~</b> </p>
      <p>The shortest preparation of this Mercury is to take 1 part of
        the purest and freshest copper filings one can find, 2 parts of
        sublimated sal ammoniac, and as much or some more of salt of
        gold. These three are powdered as subtly as possible, and when
        mixed are put in a big flask which is buried in the sand and
        given a double fire, that is, above and under it, till the
        materia melts like wax. Then remove your flask from the sand and
        the fire, throw it into a vessel full of fresh water, and all of
        a sudden your Mercury flows in the water clear and clean and of
        a greenish color. </p>
      <p>Take this Mercury of Venus, put it in an alembic pot, pour some
        good spirit of sulphur or vitriol upon it, keep it digesting for
        some time, then distill it. Put the distillate back on your
        copper marc and redistill. Continue this operation till your
        materia takes on the color of worries (black). To make it more
        harmless, sweeten it and rid it of the impressions of the salt
        by washing it several times with the proper waters. If this
        operation is done exactly, you will have in hand one of the
        greatest sudorific remedies against the plague, of which the
        dose is only a single grain, or at most two, with some suitable
        liquid. </p>

          Prepared with Tin</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Specific Remedy Extracted from Flowers of Tin against Cramps
          of the Womb ~</b> </p>
      <p>The flowers of Jupiter must be extracted with an earthenware
        vessel, made up of several small pots. Put one on top of the
        other and seal them in such a way that they form only one body
        and one tube. Into this kind of vessel throw the Jupiter filings
        little by little, together with pulverized saltpeter. But before
        throwing this substance, your vessel must be brought to a red
        heat, and you will immediately see the spirit of the saltpeter
        rise, which will soon distill in the lower vessels. If you carry
        this procedure out according to the Art, you will cause Jupiter
        to sublimate in the form of flowers, and finally you will see it
        distill in the other vessels that are underneath, so that you
        can extract at least 1/2 lb of spirit from 1 lb of Jupiter.
        However, I would not advise you to go as far as to extract this
        spirit, but you should rather stop at gathering the flowers as
        soon as they appear when they seem to be attached to the vessel
        white as snow. Do not give them time to melt, but distill them
        from below with the power of the fire, as in these flowers
        Jupiter is prepared in such a way that its salt can be extracted
        with vinegar. It can be used for many medicinal and metallic
        works, especially as this salt, when dissolved in moisture,
        turns into a wonderful oil for all female illnesses. If you give
        only 4 to 6 drops in some melissa cordial, or in any other
        suitable liquid, you will immediately stop all cramps of the
        womb. </p>
      <p><b>An Excellent Remedy for Flushing the Eyes, Prepared with Tin
          ~</b> </p>
      <p>Before using the particular remedy for flushing the eyes, ore
        has to use general ones and work, especially on the removal of
        the primary cause and the stopping of the discharges that fall
        from the brain on this noble part. Thereafter, bath the eyes of
        the patient with the water which you wil1 prepare in the
        following way: </p>
      <p>Melt fine tin over a slow fire and stir it as soon as it is
        completely melted into calx. This done, take 4 oz of this calx
        of Jupiter, 2 oz of Alexandrian tutty [crude zinc oxide – HWN],
        and 2 oz of crystal powder, mix these 3 powders, and put them in
        a crucible in the center of a strong coal fire. Leave it there
        till the fire has reached a white heat. Then remove your
        sparkling crucible and pour the materia, now completely kindled,
        into distilled vinegar out by inclination and put the materia
        into another crucible to make it red hot on the live coal, as
        before. Finally, quench it in vinegar, as above. But take note
        that the redness of the second ignition must be great and that
        the substance which is put on the fire a second time must be
        powdered, with the result that it is so dry and hot as to absorb
        in two times half of the distilled vinegar. As this materia has
        been extinguished twice, you must now let it rest for some time
        to let it settle at the bottom. Then evaporate the vinegar from
        it on a small ash-fire and a pasty substance will be left. Pour
        dew water upon it, rising above it by two or three fingers'
        breadth. Put it in a well-luted retort on an ordinary bath, and
        circulate it for 2 or 3 days. After this time, you will find a
        water which is, specific and suitable for all flushings of the
        sight, and this cure is all the more wonderful as it can be done
        in a few days. All that is necessary is to bathe the eyes 4 or 5
        times to remove the cause of those tears which prevent the
        beauty of their function. </p>

      <p>Distill a large quantity of good vinegar, till you have a cask
        full of it, because it is the basis and the foundation of this
        Work. To strengthen it more, distill it several times over the
        feces, then mix everything you have distilled with as much other
        non-dephlegmatized vinegar, and let them go over together, so
        that the distillate will become all the more efficacious. The
        dregs that remain at the bottom are put in a retort over a good,
        fire by means of which one can extract an excellent oil from
        them, which can burn of its own and dissolve all kinds of
        minerals. </p>
      <p>After preparing this solvent, take 80 lbs of powdered litharge
        -- and NOT white lead or minium of lead calx (oxide), as several
        artists do, especially Isaac Hollandus. Take, I say, this
        litharge and put it in several big and very strong flasks. Pour
        on it as much of your vinegar that it will overfloat by 6
        fingers' breadth, and then put it on an ash-fire. Extract the
        salt of Saturn by a slow digestion, and on the feces that are
        left after the extraction of the salt and the crystals, pour
        once more the same amount of menstruum as indicated above.
        Continue doing this till all your litharge has turned into
        crystals which are, properly speaking, what the philosophers
        call the Chaos or the metallic materia prima. </p>
      <p>On this crystalline substance, again put for the last time
        fresh distilled vinegar. Dissolve it over a slow fire and filter
        it, so as to obtain a perfectly pure and flawless menstruum
        which, after: passing through the steam-bath, will leave a
        substance that melts like wax at the bottom of the alembic. It
        hardens in the cold as it melts in the heat. Thereafter, divide
        this melting substance among several alembics and little by
        little pour fresh menstruum upon it, as if to feed and water it
        only. Do this by first pouring on only two drops, then three,
        then five, then seven, increasing the amount in this way till
        the materia does not absorb any more. You will recognize this
        when you see the solvent coming out as acid as it was at the
        beginning. Therefore, whenever you distill your imbibed materia,
        take care that you continue till the phlegma is as acid as
        before, because this is how the child refuses the nurse's milk
        when its stomach is full. When the materia has been prepared in
        this way and converted into an excellent and precious gum,
        digest it in the steam bath for 30 or 40 days, till it becomes
        black and has a bad smell like that of liquid pitch. It is from
        this liquid and black pitch that you must extract, by the same
        bath, an excellent phlegma which can serve as a proper menstruum
        for extracting a precious salt from calcined earth, as we will
        write later. Owing to the continual distillation that you will
        make of the said pitch on sand, and by finally giving a strong
        fire above and below through the usual degrees up to a very
        violent fire, you will extract a red and quite ' thick oil
        which, together with the preceding distillations, will
        constitute as strong and violent a water as that extracted from
        wine, and will have the same great power. The philosophers call
        it water of life (brandy) of Saturn. Its substance is so pure
        and subtle that it must be kept in a well-closed vessel lest it
        evaporate. </p>
      <p>To complete the perfection of this solvent, this water of life
        of Saturn must be put in a gentle bath, in a long-necked
        alembic, where the purest spirit of this water will rise
        imperceptibly till you see the appearance of some lines and
        filaments through the glass of the head. It is an infallible
        sign that all of the spirit has risen, and you must therefore
        stop this distillation and extract this first precious spirit.
        Preserve it carefully in a cold place and in a well-sealed
        container. After this spirit, a milky phlegma will appear in a
        stronger bath. It will be much better for washing your calcined
        materia than the first of which we spoke above. Finally, by a
        stronger degree of fire and after changing the receptacle, you
        will still separate an ardent spirit which will first come out
        white and watery, then red and oily, but it will be heavy and
        lie at the bottom of the receptacle. However, if you wish, you
        can make it go over with a stronger fire. </p>
      <p>In regard to the earth or the feces that are left at the bottom
        of the retorts as a black powder, they can also be dissolved
        with some fresh distilled vinegar and thus turn into new lapilli
        of a sticky and gummy consistency, and finally, by means of the
        above-mentioned digestions and distillations, into wonderfully
        active and burning spirits. There are some who divide this earth
        into two, but although Isaac (Hollandus) himself adopts this
        division, I am nevertheless of the opinion that the best and
        shortest method is to calcine all the earth together and to
        reverberate it by a gentle flame till it becomes yellow like
        ochre. When this earth has become yellow due to the cohobation
        of the phlegmas, the salt can again be separated from it,
        according to the ordinary rules and operations of the Art. </p>
      <p>Having achieved the extraction of this rare and precious salt,
        take the first salt which you have little by little extracted
        and which you have preserved. Pour it on 1 oz of the last salt,
        repeating this imbibition till 1 oz of this salt weighs 3 or 4
        oz and has retained the weight of the sal ammoniac of this
        spirit, till finally the volatile exceeds the filed. If you work
        this process exactly, you will find an excellent earth at the
        bottom. Sublimate it in a very clear and well sealed glass
        vessel, and you will have the pleasure of seeing in it the
        sublimation of a Philosophical Mercury in the form of a fine
        talc, which you must keep as a most valuable substance. </p>
      <p>To crown this work, take 1 part of this Mercury and add it to 4
        parts of the above-mentioned spirit or to as much ardent spirit
        to make of them a solvent for the Sun and the Moon, such as the
        philosophers imagined were capable of turning them into spirit
        without destroying their bodies or losing ' their
        characteristics. Therefore, wonderful works can be made with
        this truly philosophical solvent, both for the health of human
        and of metallic bodies. It can even be made with coral and
        litharge, and in that case you will without doubt make the
        finest and most harmless of all solvents. </p>
      <p><b>Another Solvent of Gold by Crystals of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take minium, or better, litharge. Dissolve it twice in vinegar
        then filter and congeal it. Repeat this operation of dissolving,
        filtering, and congealing three times. When at the last time you
        have congealed to the consistency of oil, put your congelation
        in a cold place for 8 or 10 days, during which time small
        ice-like crystals will form. Remove alt their humor by
        inclination and dry them very gently near the fire on a piece of
        cloth. After that, put the thus dried pieces of crystals in an
        alembic pot with some good brandy, three times rectified on
        common salt prepared and melted, each time renewing the same
        salt or rather passing it over sulphur or vitriol. Then set
        everything to digest in the bath for 3 or 4 days. Finally,
        distill this brandy thus rectified over the pieces of crystal of
        which we have spoken, to the consistency of honey or oil. That
        done, coagulate your materia again into small crystal cubes and
        crush them with calcined gold, that is, 6 weights of ice cubes
        to 1 of gold. Now put everything into a well-closed retort in
        the horse's Belly for 40 days. Then put your vessel on an
        ash-fire to gently distill all the moisture from it. By putting
        it on sand afterwards, extract the oil with much white smoke
        which the philosophers call menstruals. Do this by raising the
        fire according to the degrees of the Art. </p>
      <p>To bring this work to a happy end, take all the oil and put it
        in a small alembic in a very gentle B. M., first to extract the
        brandy and secondly the phlegma, which you can discern from the
        brandy by the tears that fall into the receptacle. Now take this
        brandy and, pour it on the feces of your oil, and leave both
        thus in the bath for 1 or 2 days, till your water is colored.
        Thereafter, distill your colored water, pour it back on the
        materia, and distill it again. Continue distilling and putting
        your water back on the feces of the oil till you have extracted
        all the tincture. If the waters extracted from your oil were not
        sufficient for the complete extraction of your tincture, put
        them back in a gentle bath to draw out one-third which is to be
        used once more for extracting the rest of the tincture contained
        in the feces of your oil, by the above-indicated process.
        Finally, withdraw from your bath all your tinged brandy (which
        can always be useful), and you will find a golden oil at the
        bottom, excellent for health when flavored with oil of cinnamon
        and given with the specific waters for the diseases you wish to
        fight with its power. </p>
      <p><b>Oil of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take lead calx and dissolve it in good vinegar, then filter and
        evaporate 3 parts of your vinegar with a slow fire. Let the rest
        coagulate for 24 hours, or in the air if it is in winter, during
        which time the salt of the lead turns into (crystals) ice cubes.
        Then separate your vinegar by inclination and put the crystals
        on a small ash-fire to separate them from the rest of the
        vinegar, which you may have left. This operation is done by
        means of the bath, till your crystals are left completely
        dry-When in, this state put them, after powdering them, in a
        flask and-pour on them fresh vinegar of the same strength as the
        previous. Then dissolve, filter, and evaporate 2 of the 3 parts
        of your menstruum. Finally, let small pieces of crystals form in
        the cold air or in a cold cellar, as before. Thereafter, distill
        the rest of your vinegar in a retort and at a slow fire to begin
        with, then at such a degree of heat that a red oil appears. When
        this happens, take immediately another receptacle, and by
        increasing the flame-fire, you will extract all the oil of
        Saturn, which has various properties for the medicine of human
        bodies and that of metals. </p>
      <p><b>Another Excellent Oil of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Extract the calcined salt of Saturn or of white lead according
        to the method of the Art, then dissolve, filter, and coagulate
        it with h common water till it is perfectly clear and
        crystalline. Now put it to circulate for some time in B.M. with
        a good spirit of wine, in order to make it purer than it is
        after ordinary preparations. Finally, it has to be put back in
        the same bath with dew water and be circulated as before. The
        thus prepared salt turns into a precious oil of which 4 or 5
        drops only, mixed with a suitable liquid, are a very great and
        very powerful remedy for all internal inflammations, pneumonias,
        pleurisies, liver complaints, fevers, and the like. Its powers
        are even greater because they put an end to all inflammations
        and heal even ophthalmias if a little of this oil is mixed with
        tutty [crude zinc oxide – HWN]. It is also excellent for all
        kinds of cankerous ulcers. </p>
      <p><b>Flowers of Saturn which are a Specific Remedy for Opthalmias
          ~</b> </p>
      <p>Prepare a clay vessel made up of 8 or 9 little pots, put one
        upon the other, as we said in the chapter on tin. After the
        vessel is red-hot, throw some lead filings mixed with saltpeter
        through the tube, little by little. Then you will see the spirit
        of saltpeter distill through the beak of the first pot counting
        from the bottom, and the sweetness of Saturn will rise in the
        other, upper vessels in the form of flowers, of which you can
        make a salt with vinegar. When this salt is turned into oil, you
        will have an excellent remedy for ophthalmia and all diseases of
        the eye. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of the Mercury of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 2 lbs of minium, such as it is, when it can easily be
        converted into glass. Put it in a crucible in the midst of a
        strong fire and imbibe it 6 or 7 times with good vinegar. Then
        add to the thus prepared minium an equal amount of crude tartar,
        and finally distill this mixture of minium and tartar through
        the retort for 12 hours, but take care to make the fire strong
        from the beginning. You will have 17 oz of Mercury in your
        receptacle which must be half filled with cold water. At the
        bottom of the retort there will be real gold. One can reasonably
        imagine that it is the gold which the philosophers call the
        fired grain separated from its vie: curt', and in fact such. a
        Saturnian Mercury is much lighter and brisker than vulgar
        mercury. </p>
      <p><b>Another Method of Extraction the Mercury of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Mix 2 lbs of minium with as much good tartar, and put them in a
        glazed pot pierced by small holes at the bottom. Put this pot on
        another that is neither glazed nor pierced, and put it
        underground to serve as a receptacle, but only after you have
        carefully luted the joints and put some fresh water at the
        bottom to attract the Mercury and prevent the breakage of the
        vessel. Finally, cover the pot that contains the materia with
        another very tightly luted pot and give it a moderate fire for
        the first 6 hours, then a stronger fire for the next 6, and
        finally a very strong fire during the last 6 hours -- and you
        will find the Mercury of Saturn at the bottom of your
        receptacle. </p>
      <p><b>A Method of Making the Glass of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Saturn is a metal whose effects are so great and wonderful for
        the health of human bodies that it can not only do great things
        in the state in which we have just prepared it but also if it is
        vitrified by means of calcinations according to the rules of the
        true philosophy. Because glass is the extreme degree and the
        ultimate perfection to which all things can be brought by the
        Art, you must therefore not doubt that the glass of lead has in
        itself not only a very pure substance but, in addition, an
        abundance of salt, even greater than can be found in any other
        metal. This is so because Saturn abounds so much in salt that
        the other two Principles, which are the liquids and the
        sulphurs, disappear completely, with the result that usually
        only the pure salt is left behind. Often it exceeds the weight
        of the metal from which it is extracted by more than half. That
        is why the philosophers who seek the Mercury and the Sulphur of
        Saturn cry out so loud, Cavete, cavete a vitrificatione" (beware
        of the vitrification). This teaches us that all metals which
        contain more Salt than the other two Principles can be entirely
        vitrified. Among these there is Saturn which, being better
        provided with Salt than with Mercury and Sulphur, can easily
        turn into glass. This does not mean that the other metals cannot
        also be turned into glass by the length and the power of a
        continual fire. The exception is gold, which, being of a more
        perfect nature than the other metals cannot also be turned into
        glass by the length and the power of a continual fire and due to
        the great equality and combination of the Elements it contains,
        can in no way be turned into glass, because it is so richly
        composed of Water, Earth, and Air that nothing can produce in it
        any alteration of rust or corruption, and even fire cannot
        impress any change on its mass. This is all the more so as it is
        of a fiery nature and that instead of being destroyed by fire,
        it is rather preserved by it, according to this axiom of Nature:
        Like things love and preserve their like. </p>
      <p>In regard to iron, it is not absolutely Impossible to vitrify
        it, although it can only be turned into glass with great
        difficulty. This is so because it contains much more Sulphur,
        which has a fiery nature, than Salt which, as we have said, is
        the basis of all vitrifications. Salt having an earthy nature,
        is purified by the continual power of the fire and can easily
        turn into glass and a pellucid and transparent nature. </p>
      <p>It is hardly less difficult to turn silver into glass than
        iron, because it is of a very fixed substance, and it only
        occurs if it is partly driven to this perfection by the addition
        of salts and the length of strong fires. Even then it does not
        become real glass but rather a stone of a hyacinth color. The
        violence of the fire will have caused it to lose its own
        sapphire color, because it is volatile and not completely fixed
        like the substance of silver. </p>
      <p>But let us return to our Saturn which is the foundation for
        making all kinds of artificial stones, after the artists have
        turned it into small pieces of ice with the help of the acid
        plant solvent. Now then, the glass of Saturn is made as follows:
      </p>
      <p>Take 4 parts of minium, 1 part of Etamps sand or small white
        river pebbles, well-calcined. Put them in a crucible over a
        strong fire, and you will promptly make glass that is yellow in
        color and of a transparent nature, which can give good ingress
        to medicines that are too fixed and too dry, consequently
        deprived of their inceration. </p>
      <p>Note that this glass of Saturn is in no way composed of a
        mixture of pebbles or of anything else that could be added to
        its vitrification, but that it is such by its own nature. To
        prove it, do as follows: Restore the metallic nature that it had
        before, and without calcining it at all; put it, all lead that
        it is, in a tightly luted crucible in the furnace of a
        glassmaker or a potter. After removing your materia, grind what
        has not vitrified the first time, and put it back in the furnace
        to be reverberated again. Continue doing this 3 or 4 times, and
        you will find that your Saturn has completely turned into a very
        beautiful glass, quite suitable for making precious stones. If
        you wish to avoid pulverizing your materia so often, you have
        only to put it in the fire of the glassmaker, and at the end of
        the 5 or 6 days that it has been in this continual fire, it will
        not fail to become vitrified just as well as by any other
        method. </p>
      <p>I think that if one were to sublimate this glass of Saturn with
        sal ammoniac, it could be melted with a candle and thus be
        turned into transparent wax. Also, if this same glass were first
        powdered and then mired with camphor or amber or with some other
        resin or sulphurous and transparent gum, one could make
        beautiful and pellucid sealing wax from it, which would in truth
        only be suitable for Lords, as it would be extremely costly. </p>

        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Purification of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take good sublimated Mercury and dissolve it in aquafortis made
        of equal parts of moderately calcined vitriol and saltpeter.
        When your Mercury is well dissolved, put the solution into a
        small alembic to separate the three parts on a small ash-fire.
        After that, uncover your curcurbit and put it completely
        uncovered in a bowl filled with water to the rim of the materia.
        Then put everything in a very cold and very humid cellar. At the
        end of 6 days, you will find your Mercury which will mostly have
        turned into small pieces of (crystals) ice. The rest will remain
        separate in the form of a black earth which is nothing but the
        slag and the useless feces. </p>
      <p><b>Another Purification of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take common Mercury and sublimate it 10 times, but the salt and
        the vitriol must be renewed each time, and it must also be well
        washed with boiling water after each sublimation. All foreign
        things attached to Mercury will thereby be dissolved, such as
        the spirit of vitriol and salt. In addition, this water will
        cleanse it of its poisonousness and blackness. As a result,
        after these 10 sublimations and 10 ablutions it will become
        exceedingly pure and flawless, and consequently suitable for all
        beautiful chemical operations. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Sublimation of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some good strong Mercury, quite flawless and carefully
        selected, mortify it with aquafortis and turn it into small
        pieces of crystals (ice). Put 4 lbs of these crystals together
        with 2 lbs of salt and 4 lbs of either Hungarian or Cyprian
        vitriol. When everything is well mixed together and the Mercury
        can no longer be discerned, put it into two good earthenware
        pots, tightly fitting and carefully luted, of which the upper
        must be pierced above. Alter they are well installed on a
        sublimation furnace, give fire by degrees, and when the matter
        no longer exhales any phlegma, it will be the sign that al' of
        the Mercury will rise. You will recognize it on an iron knife or
        a copper foil. Then stopper the hole with some paper, stir your
        coal fire and make it very strong for 8 or 9 hours, and for 3
        hours afterwards make a flame-fire with wood. At the end you
        will have a very fine sublimate, a white flour which will have
        risen to the highest point, and a liquid Mercury that has
        revived. </p>
      <p>Separate them and then calcine the liquid Mercury together with
        that which has risen like white flour in fresh aquafortis.
        Imbibe also the sublimate with fresh aquafortis. Finally, take
        everything and mix it with fresh salt and fresh crude vitriol,
        in the same proportion as above, then put your materia back into
        the same earthenware pots as before and give fire through the
        degrees of sublimation. At last, take the sublimate, the one
        that you will find hard and firm, and also the one in the form
        of flour or a white powder, crush both with an equal amount of
        vitriol, which must be prepared in such a way that after being
        dephlegmatized and imbibed with its own phlegm by repeated
        distillations, it finally turns into philosophical colcothar
        (caput mortuum or death's head). <br>
        When this sublimate and this colcothar are well milled, they are
        put together into a glass bottle, or better, into a very big
        flask, and buried in the sand in a sublimation furnace. Now
        increase the fire so much that the vessel will finally be
        red-hot, and in 6 or 7 hours your Mercury will rise very
        beautiful and very crystalline, carrying with it the best
        essence or the best sulphur of vitriol. Continue thus till your
        Mercury does not absorb any more, which you will recognize by
        the weight of your sublimate: After it has been completely
        prepared, it no longer increases as before, because until then
        the sublimate, absorbing the spirits of vitriol and salt, had
        increased in weight by 2 oz, or at least by 1-1/2 oz. Take note
        of this, as it is the true weight and the true measure of the
        philosophers and sages, which they never wished to reveal and
        always kept secret. </p>
      <p><b>Another Sublimation of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Calcine 2 lbs of Roman vitriol over a very slow fire, or
        better, take Hungarian vitriol. Put this vitriol into a glazed
        earthenware bowl, always stirring it with a spatula, lest the
        drying vitriol adhere to the sides of the bowl. When it looks
        like a paste, gradually pour it into 1 lb of good Mercury of
        cinnabar through a linen cloth, and blend everything so well
        together that the Mercury can no longer be seen. Then add to it
        1 lb of prepared common salt, grind everything well together on
        a marble slab, and put this mixture into two bowls. Give the
        same degrees of fire as we have said in regard to the preceding
        sublimation, and you will make a very fine sublimate. Now add
        fresh materia to this sublimate and resublimate it as above, up
        to 7 times. It is not necessary to add salt to the last
        sublimations, it being sufficient to add philosophically
        desiccated vitriol, that is, imbibed with its phlegma by several
        distillations. In this way you will make one of the finest and
        most perfect sublimates in the world. </p>
      <p><b>Excellent Precipitate of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>To make an excellent precipitate of Mercury, take 2 parts of
        oil of vitriol or sulphur and 1 of Mercury, cinnabar, or silver.
        Dissolve the m together with a slow heat, and when you have
        dissolved 1/2 1b of Mercury in 1 lb of oil, add 4 oz of sea salt
        or colcothar salt, according to some alchemists, or of salt of
        tartar, which is the only one capable of softening the
        aquafortis and the sharp spirits of vitriol. By adding some
        common spring water, the Mercury is precipitated to the bottom
        in the form of a fine coagulate. Now it is washed with as much
        soft water that it becomes pleasant to the taste. Then add a
        stimulating water, and finally some brandy which is to be burnt
        over it and an excellent precipitate will be left. Others, after
        adding one or another of the salts of which we have spoken, pour
        into it spring water distilled to dryness. They renew these
        distillations several times with common water, and when the
        materia is dry at the bottom of the alembic, they sublimate it,
        because in this sublimation the Mercury attracts the sharp
        spirit of vitriol, so that it cannot disappear in any
        distillation. Consequently, it is held in suspicion by the
        medical doctors and is dangerous for the sick. Therefore they
        pass it through the whites of egg. However, the first method of
        these precipitates seems to me to be the best. </p>
      <p>There are others who pass the aquafortis frequently over the
        Mercury, as we will explain later in connection with the turpeth
        mineral of the Flemish (Hollandus?) As far as I am concerned, I
        would prefer to sublimate Mercury by precipitating it with the
        oil of sulphur and putting on it prepared sea salt, so as to let
        the Mercury be saturated with the fire of Nature. Then, with the
        same water, that is, the Mercury of Luna, I would make of my
        true Mercury of life an excellent remedy for the poxes,
        scrofula, and all other deplorable diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Another Excellent Precipitate of Mercury, Composed and Used
          by the Sieur de la Violette ~</b> </p>
      <p>Dissolve some Mercury in a very special aquafortis made of true
        Hungarian vitriol, good saltpeter, and those small Hungarian
        garnets that are full of solar sulphur. Pass the water 3 or 4
        times over the feces till it takes on the color of a
        highly-colored hyacinth and is saturated with the sulphur of the
        aforesaid garnets because, when you throw your Mercury into this
        water, it attracts the solar sulphur of these garnets, and in
        this way you will make of it an excellent remedy, while it would
        otherwise be more harmful than useful. The Mercury to be
        precipitated must necessarily be that of cinnabar or of
        antimony. Dissolve it in this aqua fortis till it is completely
        changed into water. Now precipitate it in spring water in which
        you have previously dissolved some prepared common salt, or
        better, the salt extracted from the colcothar. You will suddenly
        see your Mercury coagulate at the bottom. Thereafter, pour off
        the clear water by inclination and wash the coagulate with as
        much soft water that no sharpness is left. Now boil this soft
        calx with coral brandy, then wash everything with dew water, and
        when the materia is quite dry, pour some good spirit of wine
        over it, burning it on the matter to dryness. The same white
        calx or the same coagulate can be made with common aquafortis,
        then precipitated into salt water, and finally softened and
        dried. This last precipitate can be used for cancer and external
        ulcers, but I would not give any of it internally, unless it
        were first sublimated and resublimated several times. </p>
      <p>The best precipitation of Mercury is made with, the oils of
        common salt or nitre, or with the acidifies of sulphur and
        vitriol, which are the true mountain vinegars whose effects,
        even when joined to those of Mercury, are not as harmful or
        emetic as those of sal ammoniac or distilled vinegar, which can
        only be removed with difficulty, even if they are washed by
        several and different ablutions. Therefore, if you wish to
        precipitate the Mercurv of cinnabar or antimony with the
        above-mentioned oils, take 2 parts of one of these oils to I
        part of Mercury, put everything in a flask on a slow fire till
        all of the Mercury is dissolved and has completely turned into
        water. Thereafter, first pour on it 3 or 4 oz of good prepared
        salt, and secondly, spring water, so as to coagulate your
        Mercury into a white coagulate. Then soften it as much as you
        can by passing it several times through stimulating waters and
        finally through brandy, and thus you will make an excellent
        precipitate of Mercury. There are some who sublimate it on
        prepared salt and the soft sublimate, and thus get a very useful
        purgative from it. </p>
      <p><b>Precipitate of Mercury without Aquafortis ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take quicksilver and gold, make an amalgam of them as the
        goldsmiths do, then separate the Mercury as much as possible
        through a leather. Put the matter that did not pass in a flask
        which, sealed or not, is put in an athanor where your materia
        will soon rise to the top of the glass and will gradually become
        red. Take care not to increase the fire, lest the Mercury
        evaporate before it is completely digested. In this way you will
        have a Mercury precipitated by gold, whose powers are wonderful
        and quite numerous. The main ones are the following: </p>
      <p>First, this powder is excellent for the cure of gout, if you
        give once a Month half a dram with 2 oz of bugloss preserve in
        the form of pills. It is also wonderful for venereal diseases,
        because if you give only 4 or 6 grains with some preserve or
        wine for 8 days, you will completely cure syphilis. </p>
      <p>If you use silver instead of gold when making your amalgam, and
        you give 4 grains of it together with betony or melissa
        preserve, you will assuredly cure mental derangements,
        melancholy (depression) and even epilepsy, provided you add to
        this precipitate some peony water. </p>
      <p><b>Red Precipitate of Mercury by Means of Gold ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 6 parts of Mercury of cinnabar or some other, 1 part of
        calcined gold. Amalgamate them together and put only 1-1/2 oz in
        each flask on a continuous athanor fire. They must not be
        hermetically closed, to allow the humor of Mercury to evaporate.
        In three weeks at most you will see the most beautiful red
        precipitate and the most useful for health that can be imagined.
      </p>
      <p><b>Red Mercury Precipitated by Means of Quicklime ~</b> </p>
      <p>With the help of quicklime that has only been coarsely ground
        one day, it is possible to make an extremely red precipitate of
        common Mercury. The method of making it well is to put common
        Mercury in an alembic and upon it enough of this new cal to
        cover the Mercury by 4 fingers' breadth. Give fire by degrees,
        to make it come out into the receptacle half filled with water.
        The Mercury will leave a portion of its substance intermixed
        with that of the ca1x. Then take what has passed into the
        receptacle, which you will find much purer and more flawless
        than before. Wipe it clean and put it back into the alembic, in
        such a way that it sinks to the bottom, which will easily happen
        owing to its heaviness. Raise the fire further by degrees and
        repeat this operation 6 or 7 times, for the more you repeat it,
        the better the result will be, because Mercury will always
        decrease in weight. Finally, take this matter, that is, the calx
        at the bottom of the alembic, and dissolve it in a big bowl of
        water, stirring it by hand and making the lightest part come
        out, in the same way as minium is prepared. By several ablutions
        your calx will pass from one earthenware pot to another, with
        the result that at the bottom of your bowl only the Mercury
        precipitated by the spirits of the salt will remain as red as
        field poppies. </p>
      <p><b>Mercury Precipitated in all Kinds of Colors ~</b> </p>
      <p>Mercury can be precipitated in any color one wishes if, after
        dissolving it in aqua fortis, you throw into it all the things
        that can precipitate and color it. Thus you will make it white
        as milk if you throw sea salt in the aquafortis that has
        dissolved it. You will make it quite red if you throw urine into
        the same aquafortis. You can make it tan-colored red by pouring
        on oil or salt of tartar, and you will make it become quite
        green by putting some salt of Venus (copper) into it. In short,
        you can metamorphose it into all the colors you wish with the
        various salts whose properties are taught by philosophy. </p>
      <p><b>Diaphoretic and Fixed Precipitated Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>First you must make an aqua fortis of saltpeter, alum, and
        vitriol, 1-1/2 oz of each. After it is well dephlegmatized,
        dissolve in 2 lbs of this water 1 oz of antimony; of talcum,
        cinnabar, and sulphur 1-1/2 oz each; of the sublimate, the
        verdigris, and the Crocus Martis 1/2 oz each. When everything
        has been soaking for 24 hours, remove all the water with a very
        strong fire till all the spirits have passed. After having well
        dephlegmatized it, dissolve very good Mercury in it, which will
        precipitate at the 4th distillation, and if you raise the fire
        for the last, you will find your Mercury at the bottom of the
        alembic, turned into a very red and fixed powder. You can soften
        it with several ablutions of fresh water, and if you wish to
        make it wonderful for the health and even for chemical works,
        pour up to 9 times tartarized brandy over it, till it comes out
        insipid or soft. Instead of common Mercury, some take Mercury of
        cinnabar which they revivify or else weaken with sulphur,
        resuscitating it afterwards with brandy or brandy of tartar. </p>
      <p><b>Another Diaphoretic and Fixed Precipitated Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>You must well purify the amount of Mercury of antimony or of
        cinnabar that you wish to take, then precipitate it all by
        itself by putting it on the fire in a flask of good glass,
        hermetically closed, letting it thus gently boil in an athanor
        for 20 or 25 days, or the time needed to precipitate it
        completely. After that, dissolve it in twice distilled vinegar,
        pouring fresh distilled vinegar over the precipitated mercury
        till it is completely dissolved. When you have reduced it to
        this condition, put it in a glass bowl with a flat and quite
        smooth bottom, so that it settles in the center quite congealed,
        discarding around it the evil-smelling excrements and scoriae
        which are not homogeneous. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, rectify a good oil of the Green Lion and pass
        it three times through the beak of the vessel, together with its
        spirit. The fourth time, pass the oil alone through the alembic
        with a moderately hot ash-fire, and what will stay in it is the
        germ or the salt of the oil, which is quite suitable for
        extracting the spirit of gold. What has come out is the phlegma
        which we need to soften our Mercury. This phlegma, or this
        rectified oil, is put on the purified Mercury, so as to float
        over the materia by 3 fingers' breadth. This must be done in a
        small glass alembic on a moderate and temperate ash-fire. Keep
        your vessel on it for 7 hours, then separate your oil by
        distillation according to the degrees of the Art, and your
        Mercury will be left congealed in whiteness at the bottom of the
        vessel. </p>
      <p>Put the same oil back on the congealed Mercury, distill it
        again, and continue doing this till the oil has lost all its
        power. When this has happened, strengthen the stomach of the
        Ostrich with some fresh liquid of the Green Lion, digesting it
        as often as you did before, and repeat this till the rectified
        -Mercury becomes blood red. This done, take this rubified
        Mercury and powder it subtly in a hermetically sealed flask of
        very strong glass. Keeping it in an athanor on a suitable fire,
        you will have a fixed Mercury in 7 days, which can be called the
        true diaphoretic Mercury and can be used as an excellent remedy
        for several great diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Mineral Turpeth ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take Mercury of cinnabar or antimony, put it in a flask, pour
        on it enough oil of vitriol to overfloat it by 2 or 3 fingers'
        breadth, and leave everything in the cold till the Mercury turns
        into calx. Distill this Gala to a liquid through the retort or
        the alembic, pour some more fresh oil of vitriol, on it, then
        distill. Now again pour some fresh oil on it and distill once
        more. Do this 4 or 5 times, and you will find a yellow powder.
        After it is well dried, wash it carefully with common water to
        remove its acrimony, then finally add some spirit of wine and
        distill. If you wish to make it more harmless and perfect, pour
        some dew water on it and distill it like the spirit of wine.
        Thus you will have an excellent turpeth, of which the dose is 6
        to 12 grains at most. </p>
      <p><b>Another Mineral Turpeth ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 oz of rolled gold leaf and 12 oz of Mercury, dissolve
        the gold in aqua regia and the Mercury in common aquafortis.
        Unite these two solutions, and an Eclipse with result.
        Thereafter distill by degree, and increase it at the end as much
        as you can. Break your retort, pulverize the precipitated
        substance at the bottom, put the latter back into an another
        retort, and pour all the water that you have distilled 3 or 4
        times over it. </p>
      <p>The last time, increase your fire to make everything rise that
        can be sublimated. Take only what is at the bottom, powder it
        and put it in a crucible over live coal to expel the spirits of
        the aquafortis as much as possible. Take this powder, triturate
        it well on a marble slab and then in a glass mortar, pound it
        with common distilled water, and you will see some grease
        floating over your powder. Pour it out and preserve it. Repeat
        this ablution with fresh water till nothing greasy floats on top
        and your water comes out as soft as when you poured it on. This
        water is such that it you touch cankerous or syphilitic ulcers
        with it, it will consume the dead flesh by pricking the live a
        little, and will certainly cure them. </p>
      <p>In regard to the remaining powder, take care to wash it with
        cordial waters and finally with the theriacal water of
        Paracelsus, which he makes with theriac, myrrh, saffron, and
        brandy, because your powder will draw out their fragrance and
        will become more restorative because of it. This powder is used
        to cause a mild vomiting, which is necessary for the treatment
        of syphilis and the poxes, and it will cause at least 7 or 8
        movements of the bowel, if you give 6 or 7 grains in substance
        with some rose preserves. Occasionally, its action continues to
        the following day, and therefore the second dose must not be
        given till the third day, as the latter will not only purge till
        the following day but sometimes for three or four days more.
        Accordingly, you must not administer any while it is working and
        must wait with the third dose till the purgation of the second
        is over, at Which time you can confidently give the third, which
        will purge for many days. By this method the Naples sickness
        (cholera) is cured, even if it were accompanied by a thousand
        ulcers, for even the first dose stops all pain, and the others
        cut the root of the illness. </p>
      <p><b>Another Mineral Turpeth by a Flemish Physician ~</b> </p>
      <p>He makes his mineral turpeth by precipitating Mercury into a
        good oil of vitriol or sulphur, well dephlegmatized, passing
        this oil twice or three times over the Mercury. To soften it
        greatly, he washes it with various waters and turns it as he
        pleases either into a purgative or a sudorific. To make it
        purgative, he mixes it with scammony or some other cathartic,
        and he gives only a few grains of this mixture. To make it
        sudorific, however, he fixes it by the addition of saltpeter
        which he ignites and washes with several ablutions. The ordinary
        dose is 18 grains, and the extraordinary 1 scruple, which is
        given to those one wishes to perspire a great deal. </p>
      <p><b>Essencified Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take common Mercury, purify it well beforehand by distilling it
        3 or 4 times through the retort with crude Montpellier tartar.
        Then make a precipitate with aquafortis, cohobate it three
        times, the last time giving a strong fire to drive out all the
        spirits. Now dissolve it in vinegar, and continue pouring fresh
        on till the matter is completely dissolved. Do this on an
        ash-fire, where you will finally distill the vinegar to dryness.
        Upon this dry matter pour common water and distill it. Repeat
        this 4 times, each time renewing the water, then distill it to
        dryness and put your dried materia for, two weeks to digest with
        spirit of wine. After this time, separate this spirit by
        distillation, but be careful not to open the vessel before twice
        24 hours, because during this time the matter will dissolve
        completely. Crystals will form at the neck of the retort, and at
        the bottom of the retort you will find an ash-colored oil in
        which you can dissolve the call of the Sun according to the Art,
        that is, I part of the gold cal in 3 parts of oil. After that,
        it congeals into a red powder in an athanor within 20 days. Of
        this powder one gives the dose of 1-1 /2 grains in wine. It
        purges from below and through perspiration, and one can cure
        syphilis, dropsy, and several other illnesses. </p>
      <p><b>Mercurial Brandy ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 4 oz of antimony, some tin and some lead, of each half a
        pound. Melt the tin and the lead in a crucible, then add the
        antimony, and when everything is quite hot, add 1 lb of tartar
        and 1 lb of saltpeter. Pulverize and make a Regulus. When cold,
        cast it into an ingot, pulverize this materia and put it in a
        retort with a sand-fire. Add 2 parts of sublimate. Now attach a
        big receptacle and increase the fire, so that nothing can come
        out any longer. Note that there will be some revivified antimony
        at the bottom of the receptacle, which you must separate. To
        gather the mercurial brandy, one has only to pour water into the
        receptacle, and it will immediately turn white. Pour everything
        into a big earthenware pot, and after, your flowers have settled
        at the bottom and the water has cleared, pour this water off and
        replace it with fresh one till it becomes tasteless. Then your
        mercurial brandy is ready. It can even be better prepared for
        the sick by cooking it for 3 or 4 days in a hermetically closed
        flask on very hot sand, then burning on it 7 or 8 times very
        carefully rectified brandy. (ordinary brandy, Not mercurial
        brandy). The dose is from 2 to 4 grains in some preserve, and is
        given for scrofula, syphilis, ulcers, worms, and other
        illnesses. </p>
      <p><b>Another Mercurial Brandy ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some good Mercury sublimated with vitriol in the way we
        have taught. Dissolve it in aquafortis made of vitriol and
        saltpeter, distill it to dryness, and then give a good
        sublimation fire. Take what has been sublimated, dissolve it
        again in fresh aquafortis, distill and resublimate it
        immediately. Continue doing this till there are no more feces at
        the bottom. You must always separate the latter, and by these
        repeated dissolutions and sublimations you will prepare a
        sublimate teat is very beautiful, transparent, and crystalline,
        whose feces are as beautiful as the sublimate. By this process
        you will obtain a quintessence of Mercury. Some make it in
        another way by sublimating the Mercury 7 times with salt,
        without using aquafortis. I find, however, that the Mercury
        always takes the spirits of vitriol away, becoming abundantly
        saturated with them, and this is what you have to watch out for
        as the most important thing. When you have turned this sublimate
        into such a quintessence, put it in a hermetically sealed flask
        in an athanor fire or a fire that does not exceed the heat of
        the sun, and calcine it for 20 days. Thereafter, put the thus
        calcined powder in an alembic in a steam bath, making sure that
        the water does not touch the alembic. Your sublimated Mercury
        will dissolve and distill into a mercurial water or Virgin's
        Milk, with which the spirit of vitriol will go over, which is a
        wonderful solvent. </p>
      <p><b>Another Excellent Sweet Oil of Mercury ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some gum of Mercury brandy, saturated as much as possible
        with the fire of Nature. Distill and purify it just once. With
        this clear, heavy and mercurial liquid which coagulates in the
        cold. into crystals, mix some excellent spirit of salt
        previously circulated with good spirit of wine. Then separate it
        from your chilled mercurial materia till it is completely
        dissolved and no longer freezes. When it is in this state, take
        this mixture and put it to putrefy in B. M. or in the Horse's
        Belly for 42 days, which is one philosophical month. During this
        time you will see wonders happen with the, colors. Thus your
        pungent materia will become soft (sweet) through the conjunction
        of the spirit of salt and the digestion in heat, and it will of
        itself become a great and sovereign medicine. As it is not
        emetic, it is very excellent for health. The normal dose is 2 or
        3 drops in any suitable liquid, or mixed with some syrup or
        pleasant preserve. </p>
      <p><b>Mercurial Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 1b of good sublimated Mercury, 12 oz of crude antimony;
        grind, mix, and put everything together in a retort on ashes, in
        a fire of degrees, and you will distill a substance like milk.
        Distill this milk separately and you will extract a clear water.
        Put this water in an alembic and remove its phlegma in the bath.
        Then you will find at the bottom a mineral mercurial water which
        dissolves all bodies and causes the Sun to pass through the
        alembic. Instead of crude antimony, take some Regulus, and you
        will do better. </p>
      <p><b>Another Mercurial Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 lb of good sublimate, 1 lb of sublimated sal ammoniac,
        mix them, sublimate them 4 or 5 times, each time pouring the
        sublimate back over the feces, then grind them together.
        Remember to mate the sublimation in a big retort attached to a
        fairly big jar for receiving the sal ammoniac and everything
        that goes over. Keep this materia moist in order to dissolve it,
        and when it is dissolved, distill it as an aquafortis. Then take
        the feces, pound them and resublimate them with a quarter of the
        sal ammoniac. Keep it moist again and distill it, then add the
        waters of which you will have a large amount and which are
        really mercurial waters. </p>

        <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Elixir of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Antimony is hermaphroditic, male and female, of both natures,
        Sulphur and, Mercury, fixed and volatile, the first-born of the
        metallic nature, middle substance between Mercury and metal, the
        only natural solvent and natural fire with which all things can
        be mixed, the Dragon and the devouring Lion, the solvent and the
        coagulant. In this substance are expressed the juice and the
        blood, because it is the Red Lion of which Paracelsus speaks,
        which is nothing else but this precious materia of which a pure
        susbstance is extracted by separating all its impurities, both
        by the operations that follow the trails of Nature and by
        various ablutions, as we will show in the Great Triad of
        Paracelsus </p>
      <p>Therefore, in order to carry out this Work, you must first of
        all separate the Regulus, add as little saltpeter as possible,
        melt this Regulus, pulverize it and wash it as often with its
        water that no blackness is left, so that, when you pound it
        again, it stays heavy, quite white and flawless like silver,
        because when it is in this state it can be amalgamated with the
        perfect bodies. </p>
      <p>Take 1 part of this Regulus, 2 parts of gold gone through
        antimony in the normal manner, 4 parts of sublimated Mercury,
        prepared as it is shown in the chapter on Mercury. It must be so
        well prepared and so well purified of its salts and all its
        arsenical spirits, that you could give some of it orally without
        any inconvenience. The gold must be mixed with the melted
        Regulus, as in this way it will be calcined by a philosophical
        calcination. Add also the sublimated Mercury. Make one single
        body of these three well purified and cleansed substances, a
        triad or chemical concordance. By sublimation you will turn
        these three into one and the same substance, because, as Arnold
        of Villanova says: ...which is done by repeated sublimations, in
        which consists the whole secret of the ancients; but the
        moderns, like Paracelsus, add to it the astronomical concordance
        of the wine. Thus is made a great Elixir and a universal
        medicine for the health of human bodies. </p>
      <p><b>Essence of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>It must be calcined by itself, in an earthenware pot over the
        fire, always stirring it with an iron spatula and taking care
        that it does not melt before it turns greyish-white. If it were
        to curdle -- which must be prevented as much as possible -- it
        has to be powdered again and immediately calcined, as in this
        way the arsenical and poisonous part of the antimony will
        vanish. Take this calx of antimony, powder it subtly and extract
        its salt with very strong vinegar. When your menstruum takes on
        a hyacinth color, pour it off by inclination and add fresh one,
        and continue doing this till it is no more colored. All these
        tinctures must be put in an alembic on an ash-fire till they are
        evaporated to dryness. Regarding the materia or the salt which
        is left over after the extraction of the vinegar, wash it with
        distilled water to soften your materia as much as possible. If
        it is put together with hardboiled whites of egg, it will
        immediately be converted into an oil suitable for the cure of
        all rodent and cankerous ulcers. </p>
      <p>But we must proceed further and pour some excellent spirit of
        wine on this materia softened by ablutions, which will become
        red like a ruby in the course of the digestion and distillation
        which you will make of it. Pour so much spirit of wine back on
        the materia that will not attract any more tincture. After its
        perfect calcination, separate the spirit of wine, and you will
        be left with a red powder that is wonderful in its effects. Give
        7 or 8 grains of it to purify the mass of the blood, renew and
        restore the person, cure lepra, the poxes, scrofula, in short,
        the physical and spiritual (mental) diseases, epilepsies,
        dropsies, etc. </p>
      <p>To go even further with the same remedy, take some of this red
        powder and circulate it immediately in a Pelican with a very
        good spirit of wine, then heat everything on a very strong fire.
        A quite red oil will be the result, endowed with greater virtues
        than the powder which has now been separated from its
        impurities. The oil is quite spiritual, quite positive, and
        quite active. </p>
      <p><b>Another Essence of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Subtly pulverize 1 lb of antimony and incorporate it with 8 oz
        of saltpeter. After this, calcine it in a crucible over hot
        ashes, taking care that the fire does not touch it. Then pound
        it again with 4 oz of saltpeter, calcine it again over ashes,
        proceeding thus up to three times. Now that it is subtly
        pulverized, pound it in a glazed bowl with very hot water which
        you must remove by filtration. Continue in this way till it no
        longer comes out salty, and you will find your now white
        antimony. When it is dried in the sun, put it for 4 hours in a
        long-necked flask on slow ashes, with good spirit of wine. </p>
      <p>Repeat this digestion and infusion 5 times, till the menstruum
        has attracted all the essence of antimony. Evaporate all your
        spirits of wine in B. M., and you will have at the bottom a
        powder, salt, or essence of antimony, of which only 1 grain with
        rose preserve will do wonders. Others take all this powder and
        reverberate and fix it for 24 hours to make a medicine of it,
        but the essence is much better because it purges without
        vomiting. The secret lies in the calcination on ashes without
        the fire touching the materia. </p>
      <p><b>Antimony Precipitate ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take oil of salt, made with bole Armeniac, and digest it for a
        few days with some crude antimony or a Regulus of antimony, then
        distill with a strong fire. You will obtain a red oil which will
        come out in a rather large amount. If you put this oil in spring
        water, it will precipitate into a powder as white as that of
        Mercury of Life (Note: brandy is called, literally, Water of
        Life). If you give 6, 7, or 8 grains of it, it will purge
        without vomiting. </p>
      <p><b>Sudorific Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 lb of antimony, 2 lbs of saltpeter, mix everything well
        and put it gradually into a red-hot crucible. Immediately, take
        the materia at the bottom of the crucible, weigh it and add the
        same amount of saltpeter, then put it back into the crucible as
        before. Do this 3 times. Wash your materia very carefully
        several times, and a white powder will be left. Soften it and
        mix it with an equal amount of saltpeter. Put everything back
        into the red hot crucible, as before, and finally wash your
        materia very well and edulcorate it. Take 1 scruple of it, which
        you must infuse for one night in the water of holy thistle herb,
        and you will obtain an excellent sudorific. This powder is
        sufficient to make several infusions which can still strongly
        affect the perspiration. </p>
      <p><b>Crocus or Sulphur of Antimony Hepar Antimonii) ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take equal parts of antimony and saltpeter, mix them well, then
        gradually throw this powder into a medium red-hot crucible. Make
        of it Hepar or Liver of Antimony, pulverize and boil it in water
        till the latter turns red. Run it through brown paper or filter
        it other wise, then pour either simple or distilled vinegar into
        it, and suddenly the tincture or the red sulphur will separate
        and precipitate to the bottom. The thus prepared and dry sulphur
        can serve as a great remedy for purifying the mass of the blood,
        and even as an excellent purgative. Mr Wolfius, physician in
        ordinary to His Serene Highness Prince Maurice, Landgrave of
        Hessen, made an interesting experiment with it in connection
        with a young girl who had galls (skin sores) on her legs, so
        ugly and trying that he wondered if it was not some sort of
        lepra. By rubbing them with Sulphur and Mercury, the galls
        disappeared but came back later. To achieve a complete recovery,
        he made her take some of this crocus of antimony for one month,
        mixed with a diuretic extract, only in the proportion of 6 or 7
        grains to 1 dram of diuretic, which she took in the morning.
        Sometimes she had 2 or 3 bowel movements, without any
        disturbance or vomiting -- due to the aforesaid mixture. After
        taking this remedy for one month, she was completely cured. This
        experience has made him praise all remedies made of antimony
        more than those made of Mercury. </p>
      <p><b>Mixed Tincture of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take antimony glass, pulverize it, and mix 2 oz of it with 1 oz
        of candied sugar, add to it some excellent spirit of wine, set
        it on fire, and stir it with a spoon till it is completely
        extinguished. Separate what is most clear by inclination, pour
        some more spirit of wine on it, light it, and let it go out. Do
        this several times, always separating the clear materia. If you
        give one spoonful of the resulting liquid, which is an oil of
        the sugar impregnated with the tincture of antimony, you will
        cause two bowel movements without vomiting, and two spoonfuls
        will cause four. </p>
      <p>To prepare it in another way, the tincture of antimony is first
        extracted with spirit of wine. Then add to it as much sugar as
        is necessary, and set fire to it to turn it into oil, which will
        be better impregnated in this way. </p>
      <p><b>Flowers of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Make the flowers of antimony in the same way as you make those
        of tin and lead. An excellent purgative is made of these flowers
        in the amount of 6, 7, or 8 grains infused in wine, or in
        substance, without any vomiting. But you must distill acid
        spirit of vitriol together with its phlegma over these flowers,
        several times - then dry everything. </p>
      <p><b>Regulus of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>To make a Regulus, Hermes puts 4 oz of horseshoe nails in a
        crucible. When they are red-hot, he adds 8 oz of antimony and
        some saltpeter, melts everything without tartar. He lets it
        cool, then finds the core of the Regulus, melts it still more,
        adding this time about I oz of saltpeter. He lets it cool again,
        then melts it again twice by itself, and extracts 4 or 5 oz of
        this Regulus, which has the impression of Mars, which is
        excellent. Read about the properties of this Regulus in the
        chapter on iron. But to make a still more excellent remedy of
        it, take 4 oz of this Regulus prepared as above, melt it and add
        to it I oz of the Sun. Calcine everything, pulverize it and put
        it in a flask, pouring enough of an excellent spirit of salt
        upon it to float over it by 3 or 4 fingers' breadth. In a few
        hours it will be tinged bright-red, due to the dissolution of
        the gold. When this solution is evaporated, you will be left
        with a powder which, without causing vomiting, is wonderfully
        effective in the evacuation and purgation of bodies when given
        either by itself in substance or as an infusion. It is given
        with some preserve but without separating it from its menstruum.
        Given in small amounts of 4 or 5 drops mixed with some liquid,
        it is a sovereign remedy for several deplorable diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Crystals of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 3 oz of Regulus of antimony and 4 oz of good saltpeter of
        three waters, calcine them together according to the Art, at the
        end giving such a strong fire that your materia turns white,
        then pulverize it and let it reverberate for 8 or 10 days in a
        hermetically closed flask. Pulverize your materia on a marble
        slab, then put it in a flask, pouring some spirit of guaiacum on
        it, which should float over it by 4 fingers' breadth. Put it to
        digest on an ash fire, let the materia boil for 3 or 4 days,
        then remove your spirit of guaiacum impregnated with part of the
        salt of antimony. Put the rest in a damp place, and it will turn
        into crystals which you must separate with a pierced wooden
        spoon. Now evaporate one-third of your spirit, put it in a humid
        place, and it will turn into lapilli (small stones) which you
        must collect as before. When you have a good amount of these
        lapilli, dry them gently on the ashes to perfect dryness. It is
        an excellent purgative, the dose being 8 or 10 grains, without
        it causing any nausea or vomiting. </p>
      <p><b>Salt of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Powder some antimony as finely as possible, dissolve it in its
        own water which is nothing but the aqua regia. Put this solution
        into a bowl glazed over hot ashes, where it will evaporate till
        your powder is quite dry. Boil it in rain water for 2 hours,
        then, after it has settled, empty it by inclination and put
        fresh water on it till it comes out very soft and clear. When
        your powder is dry, put it in a spotless glass vessel and
        calcine it on a small fire till it takes on the color of
        cherries. Keep it on such a fire for I month. Then reduce it to
        an impalpable powder on a marble slab, put it in a flask with
        vinegar which must float over it by 2 fingers' breadth, and boil
        it in B. M. for 1 day, adding fresh vinegar as the previous
        diminishes. </p>
      <p>Now pour this vinegar into a glass retort and let it evaporate,
        or distill it, till a white powder is left at the bottom. Pour
        fresh vinegar on the latter, and when it has boiled for 2 hours,
        let it rest for I day till the vinegar becomes quite clear. Now
        empty it into a retort, pour fresh vinegar on the feces and
        proceed as above till it is well dissolved. Distill all your
        vinegars in B. M., and you will find your white salt at the
        bottom. Boil it in rain water for 2 hours, then, after the water
        has rested for 1 day, empty it into a retort without disturbing
        the feces at all and without any of them flowing into the water.
        Afterwards, remove the water by the bath, and you will find your
        perfect salt at the bottom, which is called Philosophical Salt
        and can serve as a noble medicine for all diseases of the human
        body, both internal and external ones. </p>
      <p><b>Oil of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take some salt prepared as above, put it in a long-necked glass
        flask hermetically sealed and very well luted, lest it break and
        the virtue evaporate. Then calcine it with the fire of the
        athanor. To begin, give it a fire whose heat is equal to that of
        the sun in March. Let it stand thus for 8 days, then increase
        the fire so that your hand can stand it during 8 more days. When
        you see your materia become yellow, increase the fire by I
        degree and leave it thus for another 8 days. It will become
        tanned like a chestnut. Keep it in this or a slightly greater
        heat till it turns scarlet. Leave it thus for 8 days, and you
        will see its color become half black and half red. Now give it
        the strongest possible heat, and be not afraid of giving it too
        much, because your salt is fixed and fire could not harm it.
        After this, let it cool. To turn it into oil, pulverize it
        subtly and filter it through the sieve of the cordial powders. </p>
      <p>When this powder has been made, put it into a flask with
        vinegar over it, dissolve it in B. M. for 4 days, then let your
        materia rest for 1 day. Thereafter, drain off what is most clear
        of the vinegar, put fresh on for the 4th time, and stir your
        materia 4 times a day. What is left at the bottom is useless for
        medicines, but take your three solutions, distill the vinegar in
        the retort, and you will find at the bottom a powder which you
        must put in a glass alembic with its receptacle, well-luted to
        its head in cold water, lest the spirit escape. </p>
      <p>Give a small fire for 4 hours and keep it thus till you see the
        spirit rise red as blood. Now make the fire as strong as
        possible, and keep it thus for 1 hour. When you see that your
        alembic begins to be full of snow, make a good fire till it
        becomes as clear as before. When everything has cooled, the oil
        of antimony will be perfect. It is incomparable for the cure of
        human bodies, especially for lepra, pestilence, and all the
        other deplorable diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Another Oil of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Powder, very subtly, 1 lb of antimony, such as it comes out of
        the mines. Put it in a large crucible glazed inside and saturate
        it with a good oil of tartar till both are well incorporated.
        After this, dry your mixture on a slow fire for 2 or 3 hours,
        then immediately soak and dry it till it has absorbed as much as
        its weight and you have 2 lbs of materia. Now subtly pulverize
        your antimony imbibed with tartar and put it in a big glass
        flask with some good brandy which must stand over it by 4
        fingers' breadth. Now close your flask with another (flask) and
        lute it hermetically so that nothing can enter it, set it in a
        dung-hill for 4 days, and you will find that your water is of a
        lemon-yellow color. Pour it off by inclination, and immediately
        replace it by fresh water. Proceed in this way till it is no
        longer colored. This done, distill by the bath all the strained
        materia that you have kept, and put the water back which must
        distill up to 7 times over your feces. The last time, the oil
        will be quite red, thick, and very sweet. It cures all cancers,
        neoplasias, and when circulated with good brandy, is an
        admirable remedy for all internal diseases of the human body. </p>
      <p><b>Mercury of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Extract the Regulus of antimony, then turn it into Mercury with
        resuscitating salts by means of ordinary digestions and
        sublimations. To this end, reduce the Regulus or the cinnabar of
        antimony to a very fine powder, then mix it with as much
        Hungarian vitriol and some salt in order to sublimate it
        according to the Art. You will obtain a beautiful Flying Eagle
        in the form of sublimated Mercury which you can revive into
        liquid Mercury, just as the common sublimate is revived.
        However, the cinnabar of antimony cannot easily be converted
        into liquid Mercury without sublimating it. This is done by
        mixing it with its weight of half-calcined tartar, or quicklime,
        or half-burnt bread crusts, and some sal ammoniac. For the rest,
        follow the rules of the Art, distilling by the retort with fire
        and in the same way as you make the antimonial cinnabar. Thus
        you will extract a double Mercury which will flow in the
        receptacle filled with cold water, and you will have a most
        excellent Eagle which can truly be called the Philosophical
        Mercury. </p>

      <p>Take vitriol, distill the phlegma, spirit, and oil from it by
        the retort. After that separate the oil from the phlegma and the
        spirit by distillation, which do according to the Art. Better
        still, add to 3 or 4 lbs of vitriol 1/2 lb or more of powdered
        coral and 5 or 6 oz of seed pearls. From the powdered colcothar,
        which contains the calx of the coral and the pearls, extract all
        the salts with common water distilled according to the Art. This
        salt is again several times dissolved and coagulated with the
        phlegma of the vitriol, till it becomes white and transparent as
        snow. Put the spirit and the oil on this salt in a hermetically
        closed flask, to digest and circulate in a hot B. M. for several
        days. In the same bath, or on ashes, distill all the liquid
        which will leave all the spirits with its own salt, and it will
        come out of it almost tasteless. Keep it nevertheless, to give 1
        spoonful of it to feverish patients and to use it for red spots
        on the face, and many other troubles. <br>
        Now reduce the magistery left dry and as a salt at the bottom,
        and keep it as a very precious remedy for all obstructions,
        general debilities, dropsies, hypochondriac melancholies, and an
        infinite number of other disorders. It is given by itself with
        the proper liquids. </p>
      <p>To make a greater magistery of it, however, distill the tartar
        crystals in our way. When the fetid oil is separated from them
        and the liquid is purified by redistilling it with the colcothar
        and the coral, you will extract all the salt from the feces
        according to the Art. Add it to the liquid, digest and circulate
        this liquid in the bath, and then distill it. It will leave a
        magistery in the form of salt, which does wonders for all
        obstructions and general debilities. But if it is mixed, while
        liquid, with the liquid of the vitriol impregnated with its own
        salt, and everything is digested and circulated together, it
        will become the magistery of magisteries. </p>
      <p><b>Seaparation and Conjunciton of the Elements of Vitriol for a
          Universal Medicine ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take Hungarian vitriol, as much as you like. Dissolve it in
        common water in a warm spot, filter it through paper and
        coagulate what you have filtered. Repeat this 3 times, then
        calcine and coagulate the vitriol between the yellow and red
        color, then dissolve it in vinegar, filter and coagulate it 3
        times, as you did with the water, or till it leaves no more
        feces. Now coagulate it in the bath, and immediately calcine it
        to a golden color. In a glass retort distill the spirit with a
        sand-fire. Pulverize the Death's Head, pour its own spirit back
        on it, and by distilling it with an open fire, you will get
        water and oil. Repeat this by cohobating its spirit 3 times.
        Always pulverize the materia and put its spirit back on it.
        Thereafter, extract the salt from the feces with vinegar,
        filter, coagulate the filtered salt and dissolve it immediately.
        Filter and coagulate 3 times, and when the Elements have been
        thus separated, unite them in this way: </p>
      <p>Take 3 parts of spirit, 2 parts of oil, and 1 of salt. Put all
        three in a glass mortar to digest in the athanor for 30 days.
        The result will be a Stone, of which 1 grain only will be enough
        for spasms, paralyses, palpitations, disorders of the womb, as
        also for epilepsy and all hopeless diseases of the human body. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of Vitriol from all Metals ~</b> </p>
      <p>Vitriol can be extracted from all metallic bodies calcined by
        sulphur with distilled rain or snow water, because by
        calcination these bodies are impregnated with the vitriolic
        spirit of the sulphur, which is the only means of extracting the
        vitriol. </p>
      <p>Others distill the phlegma, the spirit, and the oil with good
        vitriol, then they take 3 oz of these three combined together,
        which they mix with 3 lbs of distilled water. Into that they put
        the calcined metal from which they wish to extract the vitriol,
        till this liquid has attracted it. When the liquid can attract
        no more, they separate two-thirds of it by distillation. When
        cold, the vitriol is coagulated, and they finally separate it
        several times. </p>
      <p>But to do better, more water would have to be consumed, till it
        becomes thick in the end, which happens variously according to
        the state of the vitriol. From 1 lb of copper, more than 1-1/2
        lbs of vitriol are extracted, all the more so as the water that
        is added coagulates and increases the weight. Very precious oils
        for health are extracted from these metallic vitriols. </p>
      <p>Others reduce all metals to vitriol, after calcining each in
        its proper way. Then they imbibe them with spirit or oil of
        vitriol, which has the peculiar quality of turning calcined
        bodies into its own nature solely by imbibitions and digestions.
        Beautiful and great operations can be made with it for health. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of the Sulphur of Vitriol ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take vitriol, the greenest and finest of Hungary. Crush it and
        expose it to the summer sun in bowls, stirring it twice or 3
        times a day. When it has been bleached by the rays of the sun,
        dissolve it in water, and you will separate from it an ochre, or
        rather a sulphur, which stays at the bottom. Coagulate the rest
        in vitriol and set it again in the same sun to blanch. Wash it
        in several waters, and your sulphur will separate. Continue this
        procedure till almost all your vitriol has turned into sulphur
        and settled at the bottom. Pain-killers can be made with this
        sulphur. </p>
      <p><b>Crocus of Martis of Vitriol ~</b> </p>
      <p>You have only to rubefy the vitriol in all its parts and to
        pour on it spring water, then to mix this materia with a stick
        in an earthenware vessel. Leave it there for 3 or 4 hours till
        the water is clear. Pour it off and repeat this procedure till
        the water is sweet. At the bottom you will find a purplish
        powder, which is the Crocus Martis. Some call it ochre, but it
        is the true Philosophical Crocus Martis. </p>
      <p><b>An Excellent Oil of Vitriol ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take vitriol and distill it in the ordinary way to extract its
        phlegma, spirit, and oil. Extract all the white salt from the
        colcothar with hot water. Upon this salt (purified with its
        phlegma, if you wish) put the phlegma, spirit, and oil back,
        then set everything to digest in B. M. for several days. Drive
        the pure away with the impure, and after a fairly long
        digestion, distill the moisture. All the virtues, both of the
        oil and of the spirit, will combine and mix with the salt, of
        which give a few grains in bouillon or in wine or in any other
        suitable liquid, for all obstructions and for several other
        diseases. </p>
      <p><b>Oil of Vitriol and Salt Together ~</b> </p>
      <p>If you cannot find any good glass vessels that can stand the
        fire, the oil of vitriol and salt can be made better and more
        easily by drying the vitriol to a yellow color, and the salt to
        decrepitation, and by putting 2 parts of subtly pulverized
        vitriol together with 1 part of salt and 2 of coarsely crushed
        bole. Process them with a strong fire, and the salt will help
        the vitriol go over, and you will obtain more liquid suitable
        for extracting the sulphur from marcasites than you would get
        with ordinary aqua regia. To separate both spirits, put
        everything in a boiling bath. The oil of the salt will come out
        first, of an acid taste and such as if you had distilled it
        alone. The oil of vitriol, slightly acid, will stay heavier in
        its full strength. It is suitable for what it is ordinarily
        used. The oil of vitriol can be dephlegmatized and purified so
        as to dissolve Luna. I would use this water to precipitate
        Mercury, as it is neither as corrosive nor as harmful as others.
      </p>
      <p><b>Sweet Oil of Vitriol ~</b> </p>
      <p>You can extract the oil of vitriol if you take 1 lb of phlegma
        to 12 oz of colcothar, put everything in a hermetically closed
        flask, buried between two pots filled with ashes, lute, and
        place it in an athanor to digest slowly for 8 days. At the end
        of this time, your materia is purified and digested, so that it
        turns into a kind of mudpie. Now it has to be put into a glass
        lute and distilled with a reverberation fire. From the
        beginning, 1 or 2 oz of sweet oil will be distilled for every
        pound of colcothar. It is a sovereign remedy for fevers,
        dropsies, and even for painless inflammations, polyps, and
        carbuncles. If you change receptacles and increase the fire, you
        will distill a very pungent and violent oil, in the quantity of
        3 to 4 oz per pound. It is suitable for precipitating Mercury,
        taking 1/2 lb of Mercury to 1 lb of oil and, after it is well
        dissolved in water, pouring on it 4 oz of salt extracted from
        the colcothar with common spring water. Thereafter, boil the
        water fast in the alembic, and in this way the acid sulphur of
        the oil of vitriol will rise. If you renew the water several
        times and distill them, you will separate all their acidity. </p>
      <p><b>AnoTher Sweet Oil of Vitriol ~</b> </p>
      <p>The oil of vitriol can also be made as sweet as honey and
        capable of perfectly dissolving the Sun, in the following way: </p>
      <p>Take as much vitriol as you like. Add to it 1/4 of its weight
        of Mars filings, mix everything according to the Art. Put it for
        1 hour on an ash-fire, and the oil will become sweet.
        Thereafter, filter this oil through a cloth, and in this way you
        will obtain an excellent oil for dissolving gold. </p>
      <p>Others dissolve in oil of vitriol as much salt of tartar as it
        will dissolve, and immediately redistill the oil over it, then
        repeat this dissolution and redistillation till it can dissolve
        gold leaf or calcined gold. </p>
      <p>For calculi, redistill the oil of vitriol over crystal. To stop
        bleeding, distill the oil of vitriol over the Crocus Martis. As
        a tonic, distill the oil of vitriol, over corals and pearls. <br>
        There are some who add 1 lb or 1-l/2 lbs of corals to 2 or 3 lbs
        of vitriol and distill everything together, for which corals are
        wonderful. </p>

      <p><b>Sovereign Balsam of Sulphur for all Lung Diseases ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 oz of flowers of sulphur, or common sulphur, 3 oz of oil
        of tartar, put everything together in a big flask on an
        ash-fire, or bring it close to the fire to boil the oil till all
        the sulphur is dissolved. This is achieved without the addition
        of hot water, provided the oil of tartar is not used up too
        much. When the sulphur is well dissolved in the oil, remove it
        from the fire and let it cool. Away from the fire, pour white
        vinegar on it little by little, because of the bubbling that
        will occur together with very evilsmelling fumes. Then let
        everything settle and a curd will form at the bottom. Remove the
        vinegar by inclination, and pour so much hot water on the curd
        that all the spirit of vinegar comes out. You will be left with
        a sweet curd. With the tip of three fingers put as much of it as
        you like in some egg, and you will see wonders for asthma,
        pulmonary consumption, and ulcers of the lungs. </p>
      <p><b>Flowers of Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take sulphur, alum, and saltpeter, 1 lb each. Put everything in
        a very strong glass alembic with its head, give fire by degrees
        in an athanor, and a water will come out with which you can
        precipitate Mercury. When the flowers begin to rise, put on a
        blind alembic and increase the fire, and your flowers will rise.
        From 1 lb you will always get 12 oz or more. </p>
      <p><b>Mortification of Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>It has to be pulverized and mixed in a retort with good brandy
        for 6 hours, till it is dissolved over hot ashes. Then, after
        drawing the water off by distillation, pour more water back on
        it, and do this up to 3 times, so that your materia stays black.
        Then wash it as often with hot water in a glazed bowl till -- it
        comes out sweet and quite clear. Now, after well drying your
        materia on hot ashes, put it in a well-luted crucible and keep
        it in a reverberation flame fire for 4 hours. When it is cold,
        you will find that it is white. Put it back into another big
        crucible to reverberate it still more, and you will find it
        yellow. When you have immediately pulverized and reverberated it
        in another crucible for 4 hours, you will find it red like
        cinnabar, and fixed. It is wonderful for health, according to
        Paracelsus, who prepared it as above. Others extract the
        tincture with brandy by the same process used to extract the
        tincture of antimony. </p>
      <p><b>Tincture of Red Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take sulphur and dissolve it in oil of turpentine. To this
        solution add some zwieback, always stirring till the materia
        becomes dry and like powder. Put this powder in a flask, our
        good spirit of wine on it, which will attract its red tincture,
        leaving the oily part at the bottom with the zwieback. </p>
      <p><b>Oil of Red Sulphur for the Pest ~|</b> </p>
      <p>Put 2 oz of spirit of turpentine in a vessel on hot sand and
        dissolve there, at different times, 9 drams of flowers of
        sulphur. You will be left with a mass as black as pitch. Pour
        some good spirit of wine on this mass, then put it on an
        ash-fire, and in 4 hours you will extract the red tincture. Put
        some fresh spirit of wine on it, so much that it no longer
        attracts the redness. Distill all your spirits on the sand in an
        alembic, and a very red oil will distill. It is chiefly used for
        pestilence, and it operates through perspiration. </p>
      <p><b>Another Oil of Red Sulphur ~</b> </p>
      <p>Make a vessel of glass or Beauvais earth in the form of a lute.
        To begin, give a very small fire to melt the sulphur which you
        have put in it in small pieces, mixed with as much pumice stone,
        which is a wonderful means for activating all things. It can
        neither give the materia its quality nor impress it on it. Note
        that later you must give a strong fire (because this is how
        sulphur, resins, and all oily and sulphurous gums distill).
        About 4 oz will come out of 1 lb, sometimes a little less. This
        oil dissolves both Luna and that which is extracted by the bell
        jar. </p>

      <p><b>Preparation of Arsenic ~ Sublimation of Arsenic</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Arsenic ~</b> </p>
      <p>Arsenic resembles Mercury, both in its peculiar quality of
        whitening and in the occult virtues of its nature. That is why
        Paracelsus repeats in his Librum de Aurora what he said about
        Mercury and all its preparations, and takes in its place well
        prepared arsenic, purified of all its impurities. To purify and
        prepare it as the Philosophers do, take equal parts of
        crystalline arsenic and good vulgar sandarac, powder them and
        put them in a retort with some common water. Give distillation
        fire till the water has gone over and taken with it all the
        blackness and impurities of the arsenic, and everything that can
        sublimate has risen. Then, when you open your retort, you will
        find that the sublimate is nothing but fake white flour, which
        is all the impurity of the arsenic. At the bottom you will find
        all the good substance in the form of a beautiful crystalline
        Regulus. Having been prepared in this way, it can sublimate with
        antimony and vitriol instead of sublimated Mercury, and thus
        make the Triad of Paracelsus. </p>
      <p>Arsenic can be prepared in several ways, for some separate the
        floury substance by sublimating it with Mars or soap. Others use
        other means, as we have indicated in our Book on the Spagyric
        Preparation of medicaments. </p>
      <p><b>Sublimation of Arsenic ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take very good arsenic and fix it by calcining it with
        saltpeter according to the Art. Take 6 oz of this calcined
        arsenic with, as much good sublimate, and 4 oz of common salt,
        prepared or decrepitated. Put everything in a sublimation
        furnace or in a proper flask in an ash-fire, and when the
        moisture has completely vanished, stopper it with cotton,
        continuing and increasing the sublimation fire till the
        sublimate has completely risen into the neck of the vessel. It
        will happen in 12 hours if you manage the fire correctly.
        Finally, expose the phial or the flask to the air, so that it
        breaks of its own and you can then separate your materia all the
        better. Take this sublimate and resublimate it another 3 or 4
        times with fresh materia. This is to give it a coagulative
        impression and the white tincture of arsenic, which is a great
        secret. When this sublimate has been prepared in this way, mix
        it with half the powdered tartar, adding some vinegar and always
        proceeding as is done in the reunification of cinnabar. Thus you
        will prepare a Mercury with this sublimate which, when clean and
        purified, is preferable to the vulgar in all kinds of chemical
        operations. </p>

          Cinnabar ~ Cinnabar of Antimony</b> </p>
      <p><b>Mineral Cinnabar ~</b> </p>
      <p>Of all the cinnabars, the mineral is always the best, and we
        find a very excellent one of this kind near Marburg in Germany,
        where there is a mine of quite red cinnabar, the most beautiful
        in the world. A liquid Mercury is extracted from it which gilds
        silver, and this Mercury is easily extracted and in an adequate
        quantity. If you add to 1 lb of this pulverized cinnabar just a
        little quicksilver, you will extract at least 1 /2 lb of liquid
        Mercury. It is of a nobler nature than the vulgar, because it
        subtilizes the metals so very much that if it is amalgamated
        with gold, the goldsmiths cannot use it to gild because the gold
        is softened too much by it. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction of Mercury froM Common Cinnabar ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take common cinnabar, as much as you like, and after turning it
        into powder, mix it with half of its weight of pulverized
        tartar. Pound it very strongly, then put everything in a big
        retort with very sharp vinegar, enough to stand above the
        materia by 3 or 4 fingers' breadth. When the vinegar has been
        removed by a slow distillation, take it from the receptacle and
        half fill the latter with common water. Add it to the retort
        which has previously been put on the furnace and buried in sand.
        Make a good fire underneath, and toward the end also above, and
        you will see your liquid Mercury distill in a large quantity
        into the water of your receptacle. Thereafter, separate it from
        the water, and after you have well dried its moisture off, keep
        it to use it for making your precipitate Mercuries and other
        things. </p>
      <p>Note that crushed quicklime can be used instead of tartar to
        revivify the cinnabar into liquid Mercury, just as sublimated
        Mercury, if it is mixed with it in the same quantity as the
        tartar. The thus prepared Mercuries are of quite another nature
        than vulgar mercury which, because of its coldness and
        crudeness, in no way agrees with hot and boiled things, such as
        are the perfect metals, the Sun and the Moon. </p>
      <p><b>Cinnabar of Antimony ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take equal parts of crude antimony and sublimated Mercury, mix
        them well and put them on a sand-fire in a retort adapted and
        luted with its receptacle. Extract from it, by degrees, a gum
        which is the butter of antimony, and when the gum has stopped
        distilling, make a fire both above and underneath it, and your
        materia will all sublimate at the sides as well as at h neck of
        the retort, as beautiful cinnabar of antimony. In this way you
        will make a beautiful cinnabar of antimony. </p>

        times as much saltpeter, and set on fire till the calcination is
        perfect. You could do the same with pearls, but it is better to
        dissolve those with the acid solvent of dephlegmatized sulphur
        because, although it stays mingled with the essence, it can only
        be very useful for it. </p>
      <p><b>Dissolution of Pearls with the Vinegar of Saturn ~</b> </p>
      <p>Distill the vinegar saturated with the sweet salt of Saturn,
        and dissolve the pearls in it. Then distill the vinegar over the
        pearls, and when it has gone over, change receptacles and give a
        slow fire. First you will see a white and very ethereal spirit
        come out. After that, increase the fire somewhat, and you will
        obtain a reddish liquid. Take all these liquids and put them in
        a small retort on a pierced plate, so that it can receive the
        hot steam of a bath. The white and ethereal spirits can thereby
        separate from the others when the receptacle is changed, and a
        red, oily, and sulphurous liquid will be left at the bottom. If
        then you pour a few drops of the white spirit of Saturn on the
        thus dissolved, filtered, and purified pearls, you will see how
        the body of your dissolved pearls coagulates with the menstruum
        into a very transparent substance, almost like oriental pearls,
        quite suitable for the embellishment of women and the
        strengthening of all the noble parts of the human body. </p>
      <p>When the fiery oil with all its spirit has been extracted from
        litharge or minium, it must be rectified according to the Art.
        First distill the pure and true fiery mecurial spirit, then a
        reddish and oily water, and finally the salt in the form of a
        corrosive vinegar, which is the phlegma with which the pearls
        are dissolved. Because of the added mercurial spirit, they
        coagulate with their acid phlegma. The same spirit, which has
        the coagulative virtue, in it and brought it close to a lighted
        candle, would ignite without your finger feeling it. On the
        contrary, you would feel your finger colder than warmer,
        although it would be completely inflamed. </p>
      <p><b>Magistery of Pearls and Corals ~</b> </p>
      <p>The magistery of pearls and corals is made with vinegar and
        spirit of tartar. After you have completely dissolved both in
        vinegar and have added a few drops of oil of tartar, that is,
        salt of tartar dissolved in spring water by putting 4 oz of salt
        in 2 lbs of water, thus giving it a strong taste to make it more
        penetrating (otherwise the essences would go to the bottom and
        turn yellow there), separate your pearls from your menstruum,
        then sweeten them with several ablutions, and you can make good
        use of them in different ways in medicine. </p>
      <p>If the magistery of pearls is mixed with some water of euphrasy
        (eye bright) in the form of a liniment, it removes the spots
        that cover the pupil of the eyes, provided they are not too
        deep-seated and are not covered by a membrane. </p>
      <p><b>Essence of Medicinal Stones ~</b> </p>
      <p>The essence of eggshells, shells, pebbles, sponges, and stones
        called lynceus and judaic stones is extracted in the same way as
        we have just taught. Such essences have a wonderful power for
        dissolving and driving calculi out of the bladder. But the
        essences of the Judaic stone and the lynceus are incomparably
        more suitable than the others, because if you give only 2 grains
        of them with white wine or some suitable water, you will give a
        diuretic which causes a patient to urinate almost to urinate
        blood. </p>
      <p>Instead of vinegar, I think one could take the acid spirit of
        vitriol or sulphur, and if they were processed as above with the
        tincture of the salt of the Judaic stone, an equally powerful
        diuretic could be made of them for dissolving calculi, provided
        injections into the bladder were made with it, using a syringe
        and the water of the whites of egg or, after dissolving the said
        stones in vinegar, they were dissolved once again in hardened
        whites of egg </p>
      <p><b>Essence of Hematite ~</b> </p>
      <p>The essence of haematite (iron ore) can easily be extracted
        with pumice stone, as we have said in several places, or with
        vinegar prepared with roses. Of this vinegar impregnated with
        this stone, one can make a syrup with the juice of red-currants
        or plantains, or a kind of a specific and very suitable potion
        for those who urinate blood. If you do not find any haematite,
        take corals or Crocus Martis, and prepare it just like the
        haematite. </p>
      <p><b>Essence of Hyacinth ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take the purest hyacinths (the gem) that you can find, powder
        them subtly, calcine them 3 times with flowers of sulphur, then
        extract their essence or tincture with the spirit of salt by
        means of a digestion in the bath or the Horse's Belly. This
        tincture is wonderful for nervous diseases, if an adequate dose
        is given every two weeks. The experience of it has been made
        with a patient who was completely cured, being twice or three
        times purged with this remedy, because it has the property of
        purging and fortifying at the same time. You can extract the
        essence from other stones in the same way. </p>

      <p>Pulverize the crystal and heat it several times red-hot in a
        crucible, then slake it in vinegar. Repeat this calcination and
        slaking several times, the more the better. It would even be
        good to reverberate it a little longer in a furnace and
        thereafter to steep the red calx several times in vinegar. Now
        pour fresh vinegar on the thus calcined crystal, 4 fingers'
        breadth above it, to extract the salt. Then separate the vinegar
        from it, and the salt will be left at the bottom, the color of
        leeks. Put this salt on a marble slab, to be dissolved in a damp
        spot. Give a few drops of this liquid for calculi in a suitable
        vehicle. </p>
      <p>Venetian glass slaked several times in spirit of vinegar and
        well powdered has the same property as crystal, even more so for

      <p><b>Preparation of Talc for Reducing it to Oil ~ Another Oil of
          Talc ~ Another Excellent Oil of Talc</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Talc for Reducing it to Oil ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take powdered talc, tartar, and saltpeter, in equal amounts,
        and calcine them in a strong fusion fire till your substance is
        white. Then remove the salts, and the talc will be left over
        calcined and reduced to a white powder. Finally, extract the
        salt from it with very good vinegar on a digestion fire. Now put
        these vinegars saturated with the salt of your talc into an
        alembic to be distilled to dryness. Put the remaining substance
        to resolve in a damp place, and in this way you will obtain oil
        of talc -- if it is true what they say that the vinegar attracts
        the salt of the talc as well as that of other minerals. As far
        as I am concerned, I would distill it to half or two-thirds and
        let small pieces of ice form in the cold, and the resolution
        would be done sooner. </p>
      <p><b>Another Oil of Talc ~</b> </p>
      <p>Pulverize talc or crush it as much as you can, put it in an
        earthenware pot which must be neither cooked nor glazed. Lute it
        exactly, and put it in a reverberation furnace for 8 hours to
        calcine completely. Now put it in a small bag of new linen, tie
        it well and crumple it a long time between your hands, so that
        the materia can easily pass through the sieve of the cordial
        powders. When it has turned into a powder as subtle as flour,
        put it in a glass retort and bury it in the earth in a cellar,
        with its beak turned upward and covered with parchment. Leave it
        thus for 20 days, without touching it. During this time your
        talc will be reduced to a paste. </p>
      <p>When this is done, put your retort on the furnace in an
        earthenware bowl, over 2 fingers' breadth of sand, which must
        cover it all around to the top. Now add the receptacle and give
        it a small fire, gradually increasing it till a white liquid
        comes out, then a red, and finally a tan-colored. Thus you will
        see various colors and different and viscous substances come out
        of one and the same materia. The first, which is completely
        medicinal, is called Earth by the alchemists because of its
        moisture, and the second, Fire because of its subtlety.
        Thereafter, pile your remaining feces and boil them in a boiler
        or a pot with well water. Filter it and keep it apart in a
        well-closed phial, just as the other oils. </p>
      <p>This last water blanches the whole body, cures the swellings of
        the legs and scabies, softens and whitens the hands and cleans
        them of all spots if they are washed in it several times. But
        this liquid not only removes spots but also warts, scars, and
        other marks, it whitens the teeth and removes the wrinkles of
        the face forever. If you give 2 drops of it to drink in wine or
        bouillon, it drives away bad breath due to putrefaction. In
        addition, it fortifies the body, arouses the appetite, and
        corrects all the defects of the stomach. </p>
      <p><b>Another Excellent Oil of Talc ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 4 lbs of good sublimate, specially prepared with 4 lbs of
        Roman vitriol, 2 lbs of prepared common salt, and 2 lbs of
        Mercury of cinnabar which has previously been mortified in salt
        and vinegar for 5 or 6 days. Filter this through a linen and
        squeeze it out little by little into your vitriol and salt
        materia which you have previously melted on a medium coal-fire
        and half-dried. Now grind everything till it is reduced to
        powder and the Mercury can no longer be seen. Then put your
        materia on a marble slab and pound it till everything has turned
        into an impalpable powder. Put it between two glazed earthenware
        bowls and sublimate it. Thereafter, take this sublimate, some
        colcothar, Venetian glass, and prepared common salt. Put
        everything back to be sublimated as before, and the sublimate
        must again be resublimated with as much talc as it weighs, and
        as much salt prepared 6 times. Always mix the feces under the
        sublimated substances, each time pounding them together and
        putting one finger's breadth of fresh prepared salt over them.
        In this way you will make a beautiful, crystalline sublimate,
        well stripped of its poison, which is suitable both for health
        and the beauty of the face. </p>
      <p>Regarding the left-over feces, dissolve them in water to
        separate the salt, and you will have a perfectly beautiful and
        philosophically calcined talc which can be dissolved in this
        state and converted into oil with spirit of wine. It is
        wonderful for improving a person's looks. </p>
      <p>So take 1 lb of this sublimate, 2 lbs of very fine crystalline
        salt of tartar made by several dissolutions, additions, and
        distillations with brandy, grind and mix everything well
        together, then put it to dissolve in the cellar on a glass
        plate. After that, dephlegmatize it in the bath, and finally
        distill it on ashes. All your Mercury will turn into a precious
        and transparent water, while your salt of tartar will stay in
        the retort and be much better than before for identical works.
        Even by itself this oil will give a lustrous surface to yellow
        pearls. If mixed with the proper waters, it is one of the
        beautiful decorations of Nature. </p>
      <p>But to prepare of it the true and sovereign oil of talc, take
        the remaining calcined talc and saturate it on a marble slab or
        in a glass vessel with double its weight of your oil, put
        everything back in the bath to digest for 8 days, then pass it
        through the retort, and part of the talc mixed with the oil of
        Mercury will go into the receptacle. At the bottom the talc will
        be left in the form of Lumen perlarum (Light of pearls, or
        pearly light.), which dissolves of itself in all kinds of
        liquids. It is the true and admirable oil of talc, which whitens
        wonderfully, nourishes the complexion, and preserves one's
        beauty. In addition, it removes all spots and blemishes from the
        skin, rids the face of red blotches even if they are natural,
        and immediately blanches a scarlet complexion. </p>

      <p><b>The Author’s Anti-Podagral Water ~ The True Laudanum or
          Nepenthe of the Author ~ The Author’s Elixir or Mercury of
          Life (Mercury Brandy) ~ The Author’s Panacea ~ The Great
          Pacacea or the Polychrest Anodyne of Montanus.</b> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>The Author’s Anti-Podagral Water ~</b> </p>
      <p>The basis of this remedy is a water composed of 8 quarts of
        river water, in which are extinguished (slaked) 16 times 4 small
        steel balls, each weighing 1 lb, and 1 ball of copper weighing
        1/2 lb. Thereafter, infuse into 2 quarts of this water 112 oz of
        antimony glass for 24 hours. In the other 6 quarts dissolve 2 oz
        of precipitated Mercury. When these two waters have been thus
        prepared, mix them in a flask to be used as we will explain
        below. </p>
      <p>Prepare precipitated Mercury in the ordinary way, but to 4 oz
        of Mercury and as much aquafortis add 1 /2 oz of pulverized
        sulphur, dissolved in water before adding the Mercury. After
        this, evaporate the aquafortis to dryness, and you will obtain a
        precipitated Mercury as white as snow. </p>
      <p>There are others, such as Rulandus, who prepare a remedy for
        gout with a decoction made with leaves of dwarf elders
        (bloodwort), the inner bark of elders, flowers of chamomile and
        melilot (sweet clover), and the right amount of water to which
        iron nails have conveyed a certain proportion of rust, or with
        old farrier's water, or water in which you have several times
        slaked red-hot copper. Thereafter, they add to each pound of
        this decoction 1 /2 scruple of sublimated Mercury. They make
        this water more or less tart, in proportion to the dissolved
        copper or sublimated Mercury which they add. The physician must
        adjust the dose according to the condition of the disorder and
        the state of the patient. </p>
      <p>For the same disorder others use aquafortis in which silver has
        been separated by a decoction of melilot, to which they add some
        sublimated Mercury. . </p>
      <p>There are others who prepare a specific remedy for this
        disorder with the phlegma and the spirit extracted from vitriol,
        and chiefly from the acidity of sea salt, which they apply with
        warm bandages on the painful part. </p>
      <p>Others successfully use the water into which they have several
        times thrown lead, copper, gold, and silver, after they had
        melted them. Finally, they infuse and macerate in B. M.
        litharge, antimony, minium, and marcasites of gold and silver. </p>
      <p>Still others prepare a remedy which they consider remarkable
        for pains that cannot be controlled by anodynes (pain-killers)
        and paregorics (tinctures of opium used especially to relieve
        pain). They make it with common water in which they macerate
        quicklime for 10 or 12 days, then boil in it flowers of white
        buds of elders, add some colcothar, or feces of aqua fortis.
        They use this compound in various ways, according to the nature
        of the disorder. </p>
      <p>Others add to the recipe of Ruland’s calcined quicksilver or
        quicksilver reduced to salt with a sufficient quantity of
        aquaforts. When Mercury is thus prepared, it is like a ferret
        and penetrates to the roots of the disorder to resolve there the
        tartars, the salts, and the gypseous substances at the joints,
        which Cause such great pains, because it checks and tempers the
        great acrimony and stops the flow of fresh substances which
        normally fall on these parts, so that it can rightly be called
        the specific remedy for arthritic pains and the great dissipater
        of the gums that accompany them. Not only does it remedy the
        pains of gout but also those of smallpox and nodes, provided it
        is only applied externally and is very well and correctly
        prepared, and not at all crude, such as apothecaries are used to
        prepare in their ointments, plasters, and poultices. One can
        also distill the waters in which the Mercuries have been
        calcined and dissolved, and use these waters saturated with
        their essence as a very powerful remedy. </p>
      <p>It is, therefore, not without reason that some metallic or
        mineral substance is added to all anti-podagral waters, all the
        more so as they all contain some mercurial substance. The latter
        is the true refrigerant which drives away the inflammations and
        the acrimony of the substances held in the joints. And this is
        not done as do the oxycrats, the plantain juices, and the
        ordinary narcotics which stop the pores, clog the coarse humors
        and the hardened gums, and consequently aggravate the disorder
        instead of alleviating it. Quite to the contrary, because of the
        mercurial salts which they impart to the waters where they are
        infused, they temper the acrimony of the fluid substances,
        dissipate, attenuate, resolve and consume the gypseous and
        gummatous ones, and simultaneously remove the co-existing cause
        of the disorder which brings about the pain. Consequently, they
        cure gout totally and radically, together with all its pain. </p>
      <p>The way to use this anti-podagral water is to soak a cloth in
        it in the form of a sling. Tie it above the sick spot, and it
        will drive the trouble downward. Gradually lower the bandage to
        follow the ailment till it has completely disappeared. </p>
      <p><b>The True Laudanum or Nepenthe of the Author ~</b> </p>
      <p>The preparation of this remedy requires as its base the
        narcotic of vitriol and the Moon. To prepare such a remedy, one
        has therefore to take 4 oz of well rubefied vitriol and the
        weight of 10 ecus [old French coin -- HWN] in calcined Luna. Mix
        them together and put them in a glass retort in a violent
        ash-fire, after previously pouring very good distilled vinegar
        over them (four liters). Distill this vinegar 7 or 8 times over
        your materia, and it will be left viscous and sticky at the
        bottom. Note that for such distillations it is necessary to have
        a big receptacle of which the neck opening and the beak of the
        retort must fit into each other up to the knob, so that nothing
        can enter or get out. In addition, the joints must be luted and
        the head of the receptacle must be cooled with a wet cloth. When
        these distillations are finished, pour the last one over your
        materia. Then remove them all pure and clear, put them in an
        alembic on a very gentle ash-fire to separate the vinegar. The
        sticky substance that stays at the bottom is the true narcotic
        and the true base of which we have spoken. </p>
      <p>Aside from this, prepare some oil of gold and silver, that is,
        that of the Sun with oil of juniper, and that of the Moon with
        oil of sage. </p>
      <p>Moreover, prepare a large amount of tincture of coral, and thus
        you will have the foundation and base which you require for this
        great and admirable secret. <br>
        By several sprinklings and exsiccations imbibe the sweet sulphur
        of vitriol with at least its weight of the tincture of coral,
        which is vitriolic and in which you have previously dissolved
        some gold-leaf. When 1 oz of this sulphur has absorbed 1 /2 oz
        of this tincture impregnated with gold, add 1/2 oz of the
        magistery of pearls, made in our way and as we have described it
        in our Panacea of the oil of the Sun and the Moon. Make, as said
        above, 1 1 /2 drams. Add to this mixture, which will become
        blacker and thicker than pitch, the essences of balsam, theriac,
        and mithridate, confections of alkermes, and hyacinth, and
        sandalwood, of each 1 /2 drams; essences of carabus and camphor,
        of each I scruple; real bezoar and bezoardic earth, prepared
        deer horn, unicorn (!!!) and sigillated earth, of each 1
        scruple; essence of saffron, 2 drams; oils of cinnamon, nutmeg,
        mace, cloves, pepper, of each 12 drops; oils of anise, sweet
        fennel and lemon peel, of each 20 drops; liquid sulphur,
        distilled over pasque-flower and strengthened with oil of sage,
        2 scruples; essences of amber and musk, of each 1 /2 scruple
        (note that for women neither musk nor amber must be added). Pour
        over everything 1 oz of the water which comes out first from the
        cores of the deer horn, and circulate it in a hermetically
        closed vessel for 30 days, the better make the conjunctions. You
        will obtain the best Laudanum in the world, of which the dose of
        2 grains will accomplish wonders without any narcotic, for all
        pains of gout, syphilis, epilepsy, and other weakening diseases,
        continuing fevers, confections, stomach troubles, nephritides,
        etc. </p>
      <p>Read on this subject the works of the author where you will
        find more ample descriptions of the admirable effects and
        virtues of this Nepenthe. </p>
      <p><b>The Author’s Elixir or Mercury of Life (Mercury Brandy) ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>Purify the little King (Regulus) by several fusions and
        ablutions till you see it rid of its blackness and have made it
        quite heavy and starred. Take part of this substance, some
        sublimated Mercury, especially prepared and edulcorated with
        salt, 2 parts. Distill everything, and if it does not all go
        over, add more sublimated Mercury, redistill as before, and
        everything will go over as grease. Set the receptacle with the
        grease in a cellar for a few days, and your materia will become
        liquid, or rather a heavy mercurial water. Thereafter, put this
        water in B. M. to purify it, then calcine and precipitate it in
        the water known by the Philosophers, and in one instant you will
        obtain a precipitate as white as snow. Aside from this, you will
        see the spirit of vitriol suddenly dissolve. Now separate the
        water and replace it with fresh water as often as is necessary
        to remove all acidity. Make the separation by distillation, so
        that the distilled water leaves an excellent spirit of vitriol
        for epilepsy at the bottom of the vessel. As to the sweet calx
        at the bottom, dry it well and sublimate it with your vitriolic
        sulphur. Then circulate this substance with a good spirit of
        wine to make an excellent remedy of it. Better, take 3 parts of
        this white calx, 2 parts of the Regulus with which you had
        melted the gold and silver (because in this way your materia
        will more easily sublimate) and 1 part of vitriolic. sulphur.
        Sublimate and resublimate everything twice or three times and as
        long as there is blackness. You will obtain a sovereign remedy
        which will have a great and wonderful effect on epilepsy if you
        give of it a dose of 4 grains. But to do better still, circulate
        everything with spirit of wine and then distill. </p>
      <p><b>The Author’s Panacea ~</b> </p>
      <p>Take 1 part of sal ammoniac, 2 parts of quicklime, mix them
        well and put them in a glazed earthenware pot, or better, in a
        big glass flask, the knob of which must be completely luted.
        Surround it with fire, bringing it gradually closer to the fire.
        Finally, cover it with the fire. After the fire has lasted for 4
        hours, let it cool, and you will find sal ammoniac at the
        bottom. Separate and dissolve the calx, filter and coagulate
        according to the Art, then pound it and mix it with double its
        calx. Put it in a flask on fire, as you did the first time, and
        at the end of this operation you will find it at the bottom of
        the vessel considerably increased and fixer than it was before.
        Dissolve it again, filter and coagulate it as before in a glass
        or earthenware vessel of Beauvais. Repeat this operation 3
        times. </p>
      <p>Finally, take your fixed sal ammoniac and melt it in a
        cast-iron crucible, pour it into ingots such as metals are cast
        in, grind it and put it on a glass in the cellar where it will
        dissolve into a white water as clear as crystal. You will see it
        happen in a few days. Dephlegmatize this water in an alembic in
        the bath or on an ash-fire, and take care that instead of
        dephlegmatizing it, you do not remove all its moisture and thus
        bring it back to its first form of salt. </p>
      <p>Take 2 or 3 parts of this dephlegmatized water, put it in a
        small alembic and heat it. Now add 1 part of sublimated Mercury,
        reduced to powder, and with a slow heat, you will see it
        dissolve in a quarter of an hour. This done, take brown paper
        folded into small pieces, and let it absorb this water of salt
        and Mercury. Put each such saturated piece in a*retort or in
        another alembic, till the paper has absorbed all the water, then
        distill on a sand-fire: Your mercurial spirit will come out of
        the vessel slightly red, due to the paper and the strong fire
        with which you have driven it out. If this is so, rectify it
        through the alembic, and it will become clear, beautiful, white,
        sweet, and of a smell almost resembling that of musk. This is
        your solvent of pearls, corals, etc. If given by itself, it can
        serve as an excellent sudorific. </p>
      <p>If now you wish to dissolve pearls in this menstruum, take 1 oz
        of the most oriental, wash them well and pulverize them, then
        put them in a small alembic of which the neck is only 1 inch
        wide. Stopper it with a glass cover and put it on a very slow
        ash-fire where the pearls dissolve in one hour, leaving black
        feces at the bottom. Now separate what is most clear of your
        solution, distill it through the alembic, and you will get a
        solvent that can still be used another time. As to the dry
        residues at the bottom, distill good spirit of wine 3 or 4 times
        over them, then distilled water, by which you will dissolve all
        mercurial spirits of the solution which may have been left in
        the materia. In this way you will turn your pearls into a
        philosophical solution that smells as sweet and delicious as
        musk. </p>
      <p>Note that you must let the solution cool as soon as it is done.
        Then filter it through a brown paper cone put in a funnel. When
        everything has been filtered, separate your menstruum to dryness
        through the alembic, as you already did above. </p>
      <p>This mercurial spirit not only dissolves pearls but also the
        Crocus Martis. An excellent red tincture can be extracted from
        the latter which, when it is separated from its solvent like the
        pearls, can be used for health and chiefly for the liver. It not
        only rectifies it but cures its greatest illnesses, such as
        dropsy, and the most obstinate dysenteries. <br>
        Now take some Regulus of antimony, saturated with the spirit of
        7 metals and of sublimated Mercury, equal parts. Pound them
        together and put them in a retort to distill in the form of
        grease or a congealed oil. Thereafter, throw them into boiling
        water in which you will first see your oil precipitate as a
        white powder. Wash this 7 or 8 times with cold water to make it
        sweet and without tartness. Afterwards rectify it with spirit of
        wine. </p>
      <p>After you have prepared and dried this powder well, mix it with
        as much crystalline saltpeter and flowers of sulphur, and throw
        everything into an iron crucible or mortar, then light the fire
        with a glowing coal, and the saltpeter will ignite and leave
        your materia calcined at the bottom. Take this calx and dissolve
        it in hot water to extract the salt from it. Put some fresh
        saltpeter on the remaining powder and ignite it again. Repeat
        this procedure 4 or 5 times, to drive out the arsenical poison
        of the antimony which is what <br>
        makes your powder vomitive. </p>
      <p>When these flowers of sulphur are well dried, dissolve them
        with the same mercurial solvent as is used for pearls, following
        the whole process of the dissolution of pearls. If the solvent
        does not dissolve them completely, use cohobation. </p>
      <p>Take oriental saffron, the best you can find, draw its extract
        from it with very fine spirit of wine, in accordance with the
        Art. Separate it by distillation, then distill your saffron 2 or
        3 times with common distilled water to attract the scent of the
        spirit of wine and the saffron, which some find unpleasant. When
        you make the last distillation, take it to dryness, so as to dry
        the essence of the saffron so thoroughly that it can be
        pulverized. </p>
      <p>Take some essence of pearls, essence of flowers of antimony,
        and essence of saffron, as much of one as of the other, mix them
        well, and pour an excellent spirit of wine over them by two
        fingers' breadth. Now digest everything in B. M. for 24 hours.
        Finally, distill the spirit of wine, and your medicine is ready.
      </p>
      <p>Small children are given 3 grains of this remedy, the
        15-year-old 5 grains, the aged 7 grains, and strong persons 9 or
        10, with a little wine or some other suitable liquid. One dose
        of this medicine can operate 10 times imperceptibly through
        perspiration, without in any way altering either the
        constitution or the temper. That is why it is justly considered
        one of the most excellent remedies for all deplorable diseases
        and chiefly for pulmonary consumption, general decline, dropsy,
        hectic fever, general debility, and fevers; in short, it is a
        general medicine which not only drives away all the disorders of
        the human body but also preserves health. Give 15 to 20
        consecutive sniffs to uproot the most rebellious diseases,
        because the chief property of this remedy consists in the
        restoration of the radical balsam. Sometimes I added to this
        composition some oil of the Sun, which goes into our Nepenthes,
        and some of my tincture of salt, which did wonders. </p>
      <p><b>The Great Panacea or the Polychrest Anodyne of Montanus ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The preparation of this remedy consists chiefly in two factors,
        which are sulphur and vitriol, and the true essence of gold. </p>
      <p>To prepare the vitriolic sulphur correctly, take Roman vitriol
        or rather crude vitriol of Hungary. Cook it in common water in a
        boiling B. M., till a small skin is found on the surface. Then
        pour a few drops of oil of tartar on it to force the sulphur of
        vitriol to the bottom, while you are pouring the rest into a
        wooden vessel by inclination, adding a few wooden sticks to
        allow the vitriol to coagulate and the sulphur to go to the
        bottom. When the vitriol that adheres to the sticks is dried by
        a slow fire, it turns into a yellow powder. Dissolve it again in
        water and boil it as before till it develops the little skin,
        upon which pour at once a few drops of oil of tartar. In short,
        continue with this procedure as you did the first time till all
        your vitriol has turned into sulphur. Finally, circulate this
        sulphur several times with an excellent spirit of wine till it
        is perfectly sweet. Thus is made a great remedy which, when
        philosophically calcined with an alkalized spirit of wine, turns
        into a liquid that is suitable for all general debilities,
        dropsies, intermittent fevers, dysenteries, stomachaches, and
        especially for pestilence. </p>
      <p>Regarding the essence of gold, which gives the name Polychrest
        to this panacea, it is made as follows: </p>
      <p>Take philosophical water made of niter and sal ammoniac, whose
        preparation we have indicated elsewhere. In 6 oz of it dissolve
        1 oz of gold, distill. Then distill 3 oz of this new water over
        the gold calx, and repeat this 3 times. Thus, to dissolve 1 oz
        of gold, 1 lb of philosophical water is required. </p>
      <p>When your Sun is dissolved, distill the water on ashes in an
        alembic that is narrower below than above, because in this way
        the gold will go over better and more easily. Take care not to
        distill to dryness but only to the consistency of honey or
        syrup, and to renew the philosophical water each time -- 3 or 4
        oz, as we have already said, till at last you see your gold rise
        together with its solvent, and only a white, somewhat greyish
        calx is left at the bottom. </p>
      <p>This done, take the receptacle into which your gold has
        filtered together with its solvent, and pour on it 3 times as
        much common water as your solvent weighs. After well mixing
        everything, pour on it 4 oz of Mercury of cinnabar to 1 oz of
        the Sun, and this will first result in an Eclipse. Keep it in
        the cold for 24 hours, during which time the Mercury will
        amalgamate with the water. Pour the latter off by inclination,
        each time adding enough spring water to wash the amalgam several
        times. Thereafter, it renews the whole body by penetrating to
        the marrow of the bones, and by uniting with all natural, vital,
        and animal spirits frees the principal parts of the human body
        from all great evils that can attack it, especially from
        epilepsies, apoplexies, paralyses, contractures, syncopes,
        palpitations, and from all strange and feverish sensations of
        heat, as also from all pains and obstructions caused by
        cachexies, dropsies, hysteric and like sufferings - in short, it
        is the universal medicine and the greatest after the Azoc, which
        can cause even greater wonders if one adds the tinctures of
        corals and the all-animating salt. </p>
