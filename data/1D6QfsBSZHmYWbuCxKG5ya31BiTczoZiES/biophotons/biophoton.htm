      Cell to cell communication by biophotons has been demonstrated in
      plants, bacteria, animal neutrophil granulocytes and kidney cells.
      Whether such signal communication exists in neural cells is
      unclear. By developing a new biophoton detection method, called in
      situ biophoton autography (IBA), we have investigated biophotonic
      activities in rat spinal nerve roots in vitro. We found that
      different spectral light stimulation (infrared, red, yellow, blue,
      green and white) at one end of the spinal sensory or motor nerve
      roots resulted in a significant increase in the biophotonic
      activity at the other end. Such effects could be significantly
      inhibited by procaine (a regional anaesthetic for neural
      conduction block) or classic metabolic inhibitors, suggesting that
      light stimulation can generate biophotons that conduct along the
      neural fibers, probably as neural communication signals. The
      mechanism of biophotonic conduction along neural fibers may be
      mediated by protein-protein biophotonic interactions. This study
      may provide a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms
      of neural communication, the functions of the nervous system, such
      as vision, learning and memory, as well as the mechanisms of human
      neurological diseases.<br>

      By comparing the theoretically expected results of photon emission
      from a chaotic (thermal) field and those of an ordered (fully
      coherent) field with the actual experimental data, one finds ample
      indications for the hypothesis that 'biophotons' originate from a
      coherent field occurring within living tissues. A direct proof may
      be seen in the hyperbolic relaxation dynamics of spectral delayed
      luminescence under ergodic conditions. A possible mechanism has to
      be founded on Einstein's balance equation and, under stationary
      conditions, on energy conservation including a photochemical
      potential. It is shown that the considered equations deliver,
      besides the thermal equilibrium, a conditionally stable region far
      away from equilibrium, which can help to describe both 'biophoton
      emission' and biological regulation.<br>

      Coherence is a property of the description of the system in the
      classical framework in which the subunits of a system act in a
      cooperative manner. Coherence becomes classical if the agent
      causing cooperation is discernible otherwise it is quantum
      coherence. Both stimulated and spontaneous biophoton signals show
      properties that can be attributed to the cooperative actions of
      many photon-emitting units. But the agents responsible for the
      cooperative actions of units have not been discovered so far. The
      stimulated signal decays with non-exponential character. It is
      system and situation specific and sensitive to many physiological
      and environmental factors. Its measurable holistic parameters are
      strength, shape, relative strengths of spectral components, and
      excitation curve. The spontaneous signal is non-decaying with the
      probabilities of detecting various number of photons to be neither
      normal nor Poisson. The detected probabilities in a signal of
      Parmelia tinctorum match with probabilities expected in a squeezed
      state of photons. It is speculated that an in vivo nucleic acid
      molecule is an assembly of intermittent quantum patches that emit
      biophoton in quantum transitions. The distributions of quantum
      patches and their lifetimes determine the holistic features of
      biophoton signals, so that the coherence of biophotons is merely a
      manifestation of the coherence of living systems.<br>
