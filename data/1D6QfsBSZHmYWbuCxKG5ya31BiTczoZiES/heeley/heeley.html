      An inventor from St Helens has designed the answer to every
      motorist’s prayer - a device to make your run around faster,
      greener and give you up to 75% more miles per gallon. Engineer
      George Heeley has tested his ‘Passive Turbo’ fuel saving device in
      the UK and US with impressive results. To date more than 1,000
      vehicles in the US have been fitted with the device. The £200
      device uses clever science to make petrol or diesel powered
      vehicles from cars to HGVs more fuel efficient, cut exhaust
      emissions as well as giving a increase in power. <br>
      <br>
      The gadget gives petrol powered cars a<b> miles per gallon
        increase of between 25 to 75% and 18 to 25% on diesel powered
        vehicles</b>. Now Mr Heeley, who used to work for Tate and Lyle
      as an engineer, is planning to manufacture the device from his
      Kleen and Green Miracle Solutions premises in St Helens. <br>
      <br>
      He said: “I have the Passive Turbo fitted on my own vehicles and
      we are fitting them on other people’s vehicles at a rate of a few
      a week. It really does work. <br>
      <br>
      “The Passive Turbo works using a special air filter with near zero
      drag resulting in the engine receiving near on 100% of air on the
      induction stroke which is not affected by weather, pollen or
      crankcase venting like a standard air filter. <br>
      <br>
      “The second stage of this device consists of a container of liquid
      (non flammable) that changes its state from liquid to a gas by
      molecular adhesion. <br>
      <br>
      “This gas mixes with a metered flow of air into the engines PSV
      system in a continuous ongoing process. The effects of these two
      units working together results in the increase in fuel consumption
      as well as minimum exhaust emissions.”<br>

      <br>
      A device which can be retrofitted to petrol engines, or fitted to
      new engines during production, enriches the air used in the
      combustion cycle leading to improved fuel efficiency and a
      reduction in the vehicle emissions. Filtered air is drawn through
      a chamber 2 containing an oil based liquid A, eg upper cylinder
      lubricant, and is then delivered to the air intake X. The chamber
      2 contains a liquid in a lower section 2B which is separated from
      an upper section 2A by a baffle 4 having apertures 4A. Air enters
      intake port 5 via a venturi 8 and passes down a tube 6 and bubbles
      through the liquid A. The air is withdrawn from the upper section
      2A via outlet port 9. Crankcase gases may also be supplied to the
      engine via a pipe 14.; The air filter which provides filtered air
      directly to the engine and to the enrichment chamber 2 comprises
      three boxes 7A-7C containing knitted copper mesh of decreasing
      mesh size.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus for enriching air
      for an engine.<br>
      <br>
      Many vehicles are driven by a petrol engine. Such engines
      typically have an air intake manifold which at a lower pressure to
      ambient air which draws air in through an air filter to be mixed
      with petrol. The petrol and air mixture is then delivered into a
      cylinder. A problem with such engines is that the combustion is
      not always complete causing unwanted emissions from the exhaust
      and a lack of fuel economy.<br>
      <br>
      The invention seeks to provide an apparatus for enriching air for
      an engine to provide improved combustion leading to improved fuel
      efficiency and reduced unwanted emissions.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus
      for enriching air for an engine comprising: a) a substantially
      enclosed chamber adapted to contam an oil-based liquid, b) at
      least one air inlet to deliver ambient air into a lower section of
      the chamber, c) an air outlet to withdraw air from an upper
      section of the chamber for delivery to an engine air intake
      manifold, and d) a baffle in the chamber between the upper and
      lower section, said baffle having at least one aperture allowing
      air to pass through the baffle, in use said chamber is partly
      filled with an oil-based liquid and air is drawn through the air
      inlet through the oil based liquid to enrich the air, and enriched
      air passes from the air outlet through the air intake manifold of
      an engine from where it is mixed with fuel for combustion, said
      baffle preventing oil based liquid from exiting the air outlet.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the air inlet receives air through a venturi.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the air inlet is at the top of the chamber with a tube
      extending inside the chamber to the bottom of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the chamber includes a liquid level indicator. The
      indicator may be in the form of a sight glass.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably a flow regulator is provided to control flow of air
      from the air outlet and the air inlet manifold.<br>
      <br>
      Preferable the oil-based liquid is an upper cylinder lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the apparatus is adapted to enrich air for petrol
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the baffle is inclined across the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably a filter is provided to filter air before it the air
      enters the chamber air inlet. The filter may be formed of a
      knitted copper mesh. The filter may include two or more sections
      each with different mesh sizes. The invention also extends to a
      filter per se of knitted copper mesh two or more sections each
      with different mesh sizes.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also extends to a vehicle incorporating the above
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the invention will now be described with
      reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 shows a
      perspective view, and Figure 2 shows a cross section view of the
      apparatus with an engine.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the drawings there is shown an apparatus 1 for
      enriching air for introducing into the air intake manifold "X" of
      a petrol engine in a vehicle (not shown).<br>
      <br>

      <img alt="" src="gb2.jpg" height="568" width="497"><br>
      <br>
      Apparatus I has a substantially enclosed chamber 2 adapted to
      contain an oil-based liquid in the form of upper cylinder
      lubricant "A". Lubricant "A" can be replenished through a filler
      cap 3. Chamber 2 is divided into an upper section 2A and a lower
      section 2B by means of an inclined baffle 4 with apertures 4A
      above the level of lubricant "A". Apertures 4A allow air to pass
      through the baffle 4.<br>
      <br>
      At least one air inlet is provided having an inlet port 5 at the
      top of chamber 2 leading to a tube 6 to deliver ambient air into
      the bottom of lubricant "A" in lower section 2B of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The air port 5 receives air from a filter 7 through a venturi 8.
      Venturi 8 accelerates air into the port 5.<br>
      <br>
      An air outlet port 9 is provided to withdraw air from an upper
      section 2B of the chamber for delivery to the engine air intake
      manifold "X" through a sight glass 10, reducing valve 11, flow
      regulator 12 and one way valve 13. Air from the engine crankcase
      is also fed through one way valve 13 to the intake manifold "X"
      through pipe 14.<br>
      <br>
      Chamber 2 includes a liquid level indicator in the form of a sight
      glass 15.<br>
      <br>
      Filter 7 has three boxes 7A,7B,7C through which air is passed from
      a filter inlet 7D. Each box is filled with a knitted copper mesh
      of a different mesh size, with the mesh of box 7A the largest size
      and the mesh of box 7C the smallest size. The primary function of
      the filter is to filter air entering the intake manifold "X".
      Filer 7 however also provides filtered air to apparatus 1.<br>
      <br>
      When the engine is running, the pressure in manifold "X" is below
      ambient air pressure and so draws air through the apparatus 1. In
      use air enters filter 7 through inlet 7D and passes through each
      of the boxes 7A,7B,7C. Air filtered in filter 7 then (in addition
      to passing through to manifold "X") passes through venturi 8 where
      it is accelerated through inlet port 5 and down pipe 6 into the
      lubricant "A". Air emerges as bubbles "B" in the lubricant
      absorbing small amounts of evaporated lubricant. The so lubricant
      enriched air passes through the baffle apertures 4A, out through
      outlet 9 into the air intake manifold "X" where it is mixed with
      fuel for combustion.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the engine running on enriched air leads to
      improved fuel efficiency and reduced unwanted emissions due to,
      inter alia, improved combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Baffle 4 prevents the lubricant "A" from slopping around the
      chamber and exiting the chamber exit port 9 with the air, whilst
      the apertures 4A allow the enriched air from the end of pipe 6 to
      pass through the baffle 4.<br>
      <br>
      Sight glass 15 allows the level of lubricant "A" in the chamber 2
      to be monitored and replenished as required through filler cap 3.<br>
      <br>
      Although only one air intake 5 with tube 6 is shown, two or more
      may be provided to help improve the air enrichment process.<br>
      <br>
      The inventions also relates to a filter having two or more boxes
      or chambers each with different mesh sizes of a knitted copper
      mesh.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of the invention may be fitted to new engines or
      retro-fitted to old engines.<br>

      There is provided a method of enriching an air supply for an
      engine, said method comprising conveying pressurised air to a
      chamber containing a liquid and causing said air to pass through
      the liquid to enrich the air with one or more additives and then
      conveying enriched air from the chamber for supply to an engine.
      Also provided are an engine air supply assembly (1), apparatus
      (100) for enriching air and a vehicle incorporating the same.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to enriching air for an
      engine, particularly, though not exclusively, to methods of
      enriching an air supply for an engine, to apparatus for enriching
      air for an engine, to engine air supply assemblies and to vehicles
      incorporating the aforesaid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND TO INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] It is known that hydrocarbon fuel burning engines create
      CO2 and other waste products that are believed to have a harmful
      effect on the environment. Various attempts have been made to
      improve the efficiency of engines or to treat exhaust gases to
      reduce their environmental impact. Many of these have however been
      complex solutions and have not necessarily been economically
      viable or practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Many vehicles are powered by diesel or petrol engines. Such
      engines typically have an air inlet manifold. Air from the
      manifold is delivered into a cylinder together with fuel where
      combustion of the mixture then takes place. A problem with such
      engines is that combustion is not always complete causing
      undesirable emissions and reducing fuel economy.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In vehicles driven by a petrol engine the engines typically
      have an air intake manifold which is at lower pressure to ambient
      air and which draws air in through an air filter to be mixed with
      petrol. The reduced pressure at the air intake manifold can be
      used to draw air through a chamber and enrich the air with
      volatile components from liquid held in the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Enriching the air supplied to the manifold of a diesel
      engine is however a harder problem to address. In vehicles driven
      by a diesel engine the engines typically have an air intake
      manifold which is at a higher pressure to ambient air.
      Accordingly, air can not be drawn through a chamber by virtue of
      their being a reduced air pressure at the inlet manifold.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Accordingly, the present invention aims to address at least
      one disadvantage associated with the prior art whether discussed
      herein or otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><b><br>

      namely an oil based liquid. The apparatus further comprises an air
      inlet 104 through which pressurised air is conveyed into the
      chamber and an air outlet 106 through which pressurised and
      enriched air is conveyed from the chamber for supply to an engine
      (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The apparatus 100 comprises an air inlet tube 108 having
      the inlet 104 at the lower end thereof. Although only one inlet
      and tube is shown in the illustrated embodiment other embodiments
      (not shown) comprise two or more to help improve the enrichment
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The apparatus 100 further comprises a baffle 110. The
      baffle 110 is inclined and comprises apertures 112 in the upper
      part thereof. Said apertures 112 are configured to allow air to
      pass through the baffle 110. The baffle 110 is adapted to restrict
      liquid from slopping around the chamber and from exiting the
      chamber via air outlet 106 whilst apertures 112 therein allow
      enriched air to pass through the baffle 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The chamber 102 is adapted such that it comprises an upper
      section 114 and a lower section 116 with the lower section 116
      arranged to accommodate an oil based liquid L and with the upper
      section 114 arranged to provide an airspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The chamber 102 further comprises a filler aperture 118
      covered by a filler cap 120. The chamber may be supplied with an
      oil based liquid L via said filler aperture 114. The chamber 102
      is provided with a liquid level indicator in the form of a sight
      glass 124. This allows the level of liquid L in the chamber 102 to
      be monitored and replenished as required through filler aperture
      118.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] In use the chamber 102 is part filled with an oil based
      liquid L which can be a cylinder lubricant. The chamber 100 is
      part filled with oil based liquid L such that the apertures 112 of
      the baffle 110 lie above the level of the liquid L and such that
      the inlet 104 lies below the level of the liquid L.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] As noted, the air inlet 104 is provided at the end of an
      inlet tube 108 and that tube 108 extends from a port 122 at the
      top of the chamber 102 to the lower section 116 of the chamber
      102. In use, pressurised air is thus delivered into the lower
      portion of liquid L in the lower section 116 of the chamber 102.
      The port 122 receives pressurised air from a stream 126 drawn off
      from a turbocharger 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Before entering the turbocharger 200 air is drawn through a
      filter 300. The filter 300 comprises three filter sections 302,
      304, 306 located in a filter casing 308 which has a filter inlet
      310 from which air is passed to said filter sections. Each filter
      section 302, 304, 306 comprises a knitted copper mesh. The filter
      sections 302, 304, 306 each contain copper mesh of a different
      mesh size with the mesh of filter part 302 the largest size and
      the mesh of filter part 306 the smallest size. The filter 300
      provides filtered air to the turbocharger 200 and thus to the
      apparatus 100 and also to the engine (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The turbocharger is of known construction and comprises a
      wastegate valve 202. The wastegate valve 202 is in fluid
      communication with the stream 126 drawn off from the turbocharger.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The apparatus 100 further comprises a regulator valve 128,
      a one way flow valve 130 and an on/off valve 132 located along the
      pathway of stream 126 so as to control the flow of pressurised air
      to the chamber 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] As noted, the apparatus 100 comprises an air outlet 106
      which is provided at the top of chamber 102. The apparatus 100
      further comprises a jet 134 through which a stream 136 exiting the
      chamber 102 passes in use. A regulator valve 138 is located in the
      pathway of stream 136 to regulate the supply of air from the
      chamber 102 to an engine (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In the illustrated embodiment the assembly is adapted such
      that pressurised enriched air is conveyed from the chamber 102
      along stream 126 to an engine (not shown) via the turbocharger
      200. In use the pressurised enriched air is combined with air
      drawn in from the filter 300 in the turbocharger and the combined
      stream 204 is conveyed to the inlet manifold 400 of an engine (not
      shown). In an alternative embodiment (not shown) stream 126 may be
      fed directly to an air intake manifold of an engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] In use, ambient air is drawn into the assembly through
      filter 300 and enters the turbocharger 200 where it is
      pressurised. Air then leaves the turbocharger in two air streams.
      A first air stream is conveyed to the chamber 102 of the apparatus
      100 and a second air stream is conveyed to an engine air intake
      manifold 400. The first air stream 126 passes through a regulator
      valve 128, a one way valve 130 and an on/off valve 132. The first
      air stream 126 then passes through air port 122 and through inlet
      tube 108 to the air inlet 104 where it enters into the oil based
      liquid L which comprises cylinder lubricant. Air emerges as
      bubbles B in the liquid which entrain small amounts of evaporated
      lubricant. The lubricant (additive) enriched air passes through
      the apertures 112 of the baffle 110 and out through air outlet
      106. The enriched air stream 136 which exits the chamber 102 then
      passes through a jet 134 and a regulator valve 138 before being
      returned to the turbocharger 200. The enriched air is combined
      with air in the turbocharger 200 and then the majority of the
      enriched air is supplied to the engine air intake manifold 400 in
      air stream 204 with a small amount being re-circulated to the
      chamber 102 with air stream 126. The enriched air supplied to the
      air intake manifold 400 is then mixed with fuel for combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] It will be appreciated that an apparatus, assembly and/or
      method according to a preferred embodiment of the invention may
      lead to improved fuel efficiency and/or reduced emissions due to
      improved combustion in an engine supplied with enriched air.<br>
