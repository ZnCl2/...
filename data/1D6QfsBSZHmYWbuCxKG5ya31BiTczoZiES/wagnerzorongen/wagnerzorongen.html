      <b>SIMULATED HYDROGEN ( ZORONGEN GAS TECHNOLOGY )</b><br>
      <br>
      ...The technology that I invented and successfully developed is
      based on a new electrolyte that manufactures a unique new gas
      known as zorongen that is 94.3% hydrogen, 1.2% oxygen, 4.5%
      nitrogen. This blend is produced by a new electrolysis technology
      this was achieved by recognizing that the only way to utilize an
      electrolyzer was to develop an electrolyte to separate only the
      hydrogen blend from the water...<br>
      <br>
      The experiments have shown that a minute amount of the new
      catalyst injected into water can indeed place the water into a
      different atmosphere, once this atmosphere has been converted the
      water is bombarded with electrons thus separating the hydrogen
      from the oxygen of the water, the hydrogen being the lighter
      element would surface and is burned off as zorongen gas. The
      catalytic effect on the oxygen would cause the oxygen to be
      encapsulated into the water molecules. The zorongen gas is the
      only fuel sources that can be recycled back into the engines
      carburetor, the zorongen gas exhaust recirculation system results
      in no emissions eliminating all carbon monoxide pollutants,
      implementation of zorongen fuel" will result in a lasting and
      universal benefit for mankind.<br>
      <br>
      The zorongen gas is a formulation of gases that can only be
      manufactured through the zorongen fuel cell by the use of the
      zorongen electrolyte, zorongen gas blend can not be manufactured
      or blended in any other way. The zorongen gas unlike hydrogen will
      not explode at high temperatures but will bum when ignited...<br>
      <br>
      <b>ZORONGEN GAS POWERED VOLKSWAGON</b><br>
      <br>
      In Jan. 1990 I developed an all zorongen gas 1971 Volkswagon to
      introduce my new zorongen gas cell. 12 of the fuel cells were
      attached to the car and put on display to promote the invention of
      the new zorongen gas technology, the Volkswagon was designed to
      bum on all zorongen gas or mixed with regular gas and propane gas.
      The car was equipped with a solar cell so the car can produce its
      own energy, the solar panel produces energy to the cars battery
      and the battery feeds voltage to the fuel cell where the zorongen
      gas is produced and then used to fuel the engine.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      My zorongen gas technology is revolutionary in as much as it
      produces 94.5% zorongen gas at room temperature, at 1,5 amp. 12
      volts and develops 94.3% hydrogen. As is known, hydrogen makes up
      90% of the atoms in the universe. It is abundant in interstellar
      space with an average of about one hydrogen atom per cubic
      centimeter. However, on earth, the gas constitutes about 0.29% of
      the atmosphere, it is known that 66.6% hydrogen and 33.4% oxygen
      can be produced by passing an electric current through water, and
      separates the hydrogen from the oxygen in the water molecule in a
      process called electrolysis using hydrochloric acid electrolyte,
      where as zorongen can be produced with no carbon electrolyte and
      will produce 94.3% hydrogen using my new zorongen electrolyte with
      no hydrochloric acid. Air is a mixture of gases, it is
      approximately 70% nitrogen and 20% oxygen. Each of the atmospheric
      gases liquifies at different temperatures. Nitrogen liquifies at a
      higher temperature then oxygen. For example, air coming into
      contact with uninsulated zorongen fuel lines will liquify nitrogen
      before the oxygen. Oxygen is separated out of the water and used
      in pure form in engine combustion. Suitable devices that
      accomplish this have been designed and tested in vehicles,
      aircraft, generations. Out of my flowing equation came the
      revolutionary new simulated hydrogen zorongen gas technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ZORONGEN versus Natural Gas</b><br>
      <br>
      Some advantages of ZORONGEN as compared to natural gas (menthane)
      are:<br>
      A minimum of 4% ZORONGEN in air is needed for combustion. For
      natural gas it is 5%. An explosion of 4% ZORONGEN has only
      one-fourth the energy of a 5% natural gas and air mixture. This
      means that if an explosion with leaking ZORONGEN gas occurs, it
      would be less damaging than a similar explosion with natural gas.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In general, Zorongen is not particularly hazardous compared to
      other flammable substances. It does have some unique properties
      that require special safety considerations. Its high rate of
      diffusivity enables it to penetrate some materials, such as cast
      iron.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heat energy</b><br>
      <br>
      On a weight basis Zorongen has three times the energy content of
      hydrocarbon fuels. On a volume basis it has about one-third less.
      This means that a given volume of Zorongen will not give off as
      much energy as other gases, such as methane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Explosion Energy</b><br>
      <br>
      A concentration of Zorongen of 18% or more in air can cause
      detonation ( explosion). Only 6% is needed for methane and
      propane. The amount of pressure exploding Zorongen will exert on
      an enclosed container depends on the detonatio velocity and the
      density of the unburnt mixture. Since Zorongen bums quickly, it
      has the highest explosion potential of any gas, on a mass basis.
      On a volume basis, it has the lowest explosion hazard. For an
      equivalent storage of energy, Zorongen has a simil arexplosion
      potential as methane or propane...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flammability limits and Optimum Mix</b><br>
      <br>
      The limits of flammability of Zorongen in air are from 4% to 75%.
      This means that a minimum of 4% and no more than 75% Zorongen
      mixed (by volume) in air are necessary to support combustion. The
      range of flammability for Zorongen is wider than methane, propane,
      or other hydrocarbon fuels. "In most accidental situations, the
      lower flammability limit is of particular importance. This is due
      to the fact that in realistic accident sequences, ignition sources
      with sufficient energy are nearly always present, once leaking
      fuels and combustibles have reached flammability concentrations in
      air." The minimum limit of flammability for Zorongen is higher
      than for either propane or gasoline (2%)...<br>

      <br>
      As a young boy, the late Dr. John C. Wagner visited the Petrified
      Forest and was intrigued by the fact that wood, an organic
      material, had turned into stone over the centuries since the trees
      had fallen. He never forgot the petrified wood during his career
      as a chemist and as a Professor at Tulane University. He
      speculated that this petrifying process could be speeded-up
      through catalyzed chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      His many experiments resulted in several useful discoveries and as
      early as 1988 he was able to precipitate contaminating soluble
      metals from acid baths. The process involves introducing a
      decarboxylation product which causes contaminating metals, organic
      materials and other unwanted ingredients to become encapsulated
      and precipitate as inert silicates. This precipitate, which is
      easily filtered, purifies the baths and extends their lives
      dramatically.<br>
      <br>
      This Catalyzed Reagent Process is a proprietary blend of soluble
      silicates, which allows for effective immobilization of soluble
      metals by reacting with them to form metal silicates. Silicon is a
      member of the carbon family and like carbon can form polymers.
      These polymers are a unique class of compounds in which Sodium
      Oxide (Na 2 O) is associated with silicon dioxide (SiO 2 )
      generally in ranges varying from 1:1 to 1:3.22. In dilute
      solutions, these compounds depolymerize to form chains of silica
      and oxygen. Negative charges on some oxygen atoms react with
      positive metal ions to form stable, insoluble metal silicates. The
      ingredients in the catalyzed reagents will also react with
      volatile and non-volatile organic compounds producing a
      non-volatile, non-toxic, non-hazardous waste. The carbon dioxide
      (CO 2 ) formed reacts with the silicates and does not escape, thus
      no off-gassing. PRO - pHx (pronounced, "pro-fix") is considered
      non-toxic, non-hazardous, non-flammable, non-caustic,
      non-corrosive and non-acid. It is inorganic, water soluble,
      colorless and has no fumes or out-gassing.<br>
      <br>
      In late summer of 2000, Gwen Wagner, John's widow began marketing
      this product and named it PRO - pHx. She contacted Amplate, Inc. a
      plating company in Charlotte, NC and it's president, David French
      tested PRO - pHx for use in their acid baths.<br>
      <br>
      After successful results in the laboratory, French tested it on a
      spent muriatic acid tank and found the acid was restored to a
      nearly like-new condition. So, instead of going through the
      expense of proper disposal and replacement, he was able to reuse
      this acid, and he is still using it over one year later. Since
      then, Amplate has introduced PRO - pHx into all seven of their
      plating lines acid strips, pickling tanks and activator baths with
      highly successful results. They found that a concentration of 0.5
      to 1.0% PRO - pHx extends the bath life indefinitely and the
      filtered precipitate passes TCLP test and can be disposed of as a
      non-hazardous waste. Acid addition is only required to make-up for
      drag-out and evaporation. In the year 2001, Amplate disposed of no
      acids and has zero acid waste.<br>
      <br>
      Walt Johnston, partner in Lake County Black Oxide also uses PRO -
      pHx. He states, "In August (2001) we took a six month old, badly
      contaminated bath (15% muriatic) and restored it with PRO - pHx.
      This same acid bath is like new today." PRO - pHx is equally
      effective in sulfuric, nitric, citric, formic, and hydrochloric
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have also been run on sugar waste sludge having both low and
      20% solids content. Results show very significant reductions in
      metal concentrations as well as hydrocarbon and COD levels.<br>
      <br>
      Trials run on paper mill sludge have resulted in decreased, metal
      contents as follows: As - 43%, Cd -89%, Cr - 44%, Pb - 54%. This
      reduction allowed the final product to be fabricated as a board
      material similar to particleboard.<br>
      <br>
      Sewage plant waste was also tested with results showing decreases
      in Ca - 42%, Cu - 53%, Zn - 32% and over 99% in Total Coliform and
      Standard Plate Count.<br>
      PRO - pHx appears to be a win-win product. Not only can it save
      plating, galvanizing and anodizing companies money by extending
      the life of their acid baths and thus reducing the cost of acid
      replacement, but also it decreased the expense of hazardous waste
      handling and disposal. In addition, it is also environmentally
      friendly, since it is non-toxic and lowers landfill volumes,
      especially for hazardous materials.<br>
