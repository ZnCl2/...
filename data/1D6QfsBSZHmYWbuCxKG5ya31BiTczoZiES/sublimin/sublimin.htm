              ---</b>Physiological effects have been observed in a human
            subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak
            electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain
            frequencies near 1/2 Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a
            sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when
            displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields
            of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is
            therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a
            subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer
            monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be
            imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by
            modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a
            video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may
            be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For
            certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of
            exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be
            generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with
            subliminal intensity.</font></font> </p>

human






          subjects, sensory resonances can be excited by subliminal
          atmospheric acoustic pulses that are tuned to the resonance
          frequency. The 1/2 Hz sensory resonance affects the autonomic
          nervous system and may cause relaxation, drowsiness, or sexual
          excitement, depending on the precise acoustic frequency near
          1/2 Hz used. The effects of the 2.5 Hz resonance include
          slowing of certain cortical processes, sleepiness, and
          disorientation. For these effects to occur, the acoustic
          intensity must lie in a certain deeply subliminal range.
          Suitable apparatus consists of a portable battery-powered
          source of weak subaudio acoustic radiation. The method and
          apparatus can be used by the general public as an aid to
          relaxation, sleep, or sexual arousal, and clinically for the
          control and perhaps treatment of insomnia, tremors, epileptic
          seizures, and anxiety disorders. There is further application
          as a nonlethal weapon that can be used in law enforcement
          standoff situations, for causing drowsiness and disorientation
          in targeted subjects. It is then preferable to use venting
          acoustic monopoles in the form of a device that inhales and
          exhales air with subaudio frequency.</font> </p>

        that stores one or more speech models, where each speech model
        corresponds to a characteristic of a group of reference
        subjects. Signal processing circuitry, which may be implemented
        in hardware, software and/or firmware, compares the test speech
        parameters of a test subject with the speech models. In one
        embodiment, each speech model is represented by a statistical

        base. The system further includes output circuitry for
        outputting at least one indicator of a characteristic in

        circuitry. The characteristic may be time-varying, in which case
        the output circuitry outputs the characteristic in a
        time-varying manner. The output circuitry also may output a
        ranking of each output characteristic. In one embodiment, one or
        more characteristics may indicate the degree of sincerity of the

        The system may also be employed to determine the effectiveness
        of treatment for a psychological or physiological disorder by

        inducing various brain wave patterns through visual stimulation.
        The apparatus comprises a pair of spectacles or other viewing
        apparatus having a liquid crystal display embedded in each lens.
        By repetitively activating and deactivating the liquid crystals,
        shadows are generated which are perceived by the subject
        individual wearing the viewing apparatus. Responding to the
        frequency of shadow generation, the subject's brain is thereby
        induced to generate sympathetic brain wave frequencies. The
        apparatus finds particular utility in the generation of alpha
        waves. Because learning is enhanced when the brain is in the
        alpha state, activities such as listening to tapes or lectures
        and the like can be carried out with greater facility. Shadow
        generation is accomplished through the use of a timing mechanism
        for each liquid crystal display and the frequency for each is
        adjustable over a wide range, permitting synchronous or
        asynchronous timing. </p>

          signals from the customer shopping area within a store are
          sensed and fed to a signal processing circuit that produces a
          control signal which varies with variations in the amplitude
          of the sensed audio signals. A control circuit adjusts the
          amplitude of an auditory subliminal anti-shoplifting message
          to increase with increasing amplitudes of sensed audio signals
          and decrease with decreasing amplitudes of sensed audio
          signals. This amplitude controlled subliminal message may be
          mixed with background music and transmitted to the shopping
          area. To reduce distortion of the subliminal message, its
          amplitude is controlled to increase at a first rate slower
          than the rate of increase of the amplitude of ambient audio
          signals from the area. Also, the amplitude of the subliminal
          message is controlled to decrease at a second rate faster than
          the first rate with decreasing ambient audio signal amplitudes
          to minimize the possibility of the subliminal message becoming
          supraliminal upon rapid declines in ambient audio signal
          amplitudes in the area. A masking signal is provided with an
          amplitude which is also controlled in response to the
          amplitude of sensed ambient audio signals. This masking signal
          may be combined with the auditory subliminal message to

        system so as to produce a sensory stimulus if the system detects
        the presence or absence, as the case may be, of certain
        characteristics in the waveform patterns of the bioelectrical
        signals being monitored. The coincidence of the same or
        different characteristics in two or more waveform patterns, or
        the non-coincidence thereof, may be correlated with a certain
        desired condition of the organism's nervous system; likewise,
        with respect to the coincidence or non-coincidence of different
        characteristics of a single waveform pattern. In any event, the
        sensory stimulus provided by the invented system, typically an
        audio or visual stimulus, or combination thereof, is fed back to
        the organism which associates its presence with the goal of
        achieving the desired condition of its nervous system.
        Responding to the stimulus, the organism can be trained to
        control the waveform patterns of the monitored bioelectrical
        signals and thereby, control its own nervous system. The results
        of the coincidence function permit results heretofore
        unobtainable. </p>
