      Plant Milk has been consumed for centuries in various cultures,
      both as a regular drink (such as the Spanish horchata) and as a
      substitute for dairy milk. The most popular varieties are soy
      milk, almond milk, rice milk and coconut milk. The protein content
      varies. It contains no lactose or cholesterol, and is usually sold
      with added calcium and vitamins, especially B12.<br>
      <br>
      There are several reasons for consuming plant milk: ethical
      (animal welfare) reasons, environmental reasons, health reasons,
      including lactose intolerance, milk allergy and PKU; veganism and
      ovo-vegetarianism; religious reasons, such as by some Christian
      denominations during Lent; and simple taste preference.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States soy milk was long the most popular non-dairy
      milk, but starting around 2010 almond milk began to increase in
      popularity, and in 2013 it surpassed soy milk as the most popular
      variety.[1] Other popular milks in the US are rice and coconut. In
      Europe soy and oat milk are popular. There is also hemp milk,
      cashew milk, hazelnut milk, and milk from peas and lupin.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Plant milks are used to make ice cream, plant cream, vegan cheese
      and yogurt (for example, soy yogurt).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Varieties</b><br>
      <br>
      The most popular plant milks are almond milk, soy milk, coconut
      milk and rice milk. Hemp milk and peanut milk are also available.
      It can also be made from:<br>
      <br>
      Grains: barley, oat, spelt<br>
      Legumes: lupin, pea<br>
      Nuts: cashew, hazelnut, walnut<br>
      Seeds: chia seed, flaxseed, quinoa, sesame seed, sunflower seed,

      </b><b>Production method for plant-based milk powder</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the production method for plant-based
      milk powder. According to the method, grain processed byproducts
      or whole grain seeds serve as raw materials. The method comprises
      the following steps: performing pretreatment on edible parts of
      plants, removing stench from the plants, depolymerizing plant
      globulin subunits, performing physical fracture on long peptide
      chains of plant globulin, binding small protein molecules with
      non-polar groups, performing ionization treatment on protein, and
      emulsifying to obtain the plant-based milk powder. By the method,
      an out-dated grain processing mode is changed; the utilization
      rate of grains is greatly improved; a whole ecological industry
      chain is created; moreover, the product, namely plant-based milk
      or plant-based milk powder, produced by the method is similar to
      animal milk.<br>

      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a milk product scarcely causing
      lactose intolerance and richly containing nutrients, and to
      provide a method for producing the same. SOLUTION: This milk
      product exhibiting green color contains a powder in a dispersed
      state in an amount of 0.2-5.0 wt.% based on the total amount of
      the milk product. The powder has a particle diameter of 0.5-2.0
      [mu]m, and is prepared by culturing Artemisia princeps, a plant
      belonging to the genus Artemisia in the family Compositae, by a
      special culture method, harvesting the plant, drying the harvested
      plant, and subsequently pulverizing the dried plant.; The method
      for producing the green milk product comprises the combination of
      a process for steaming the plant belonging to the genus Artemisia
      in the family Compositae, drying the steamed plant and
      subsequently pulverizing the dried plant, a process for dissolving
      a sugar and a dispersing agent in high temperature water and
      subsequently dispersing the particles of the plant belonging to
      the genus Artemisia in the family Compositae in the solution, and
      a process for adding and mixing the dispersion to milk to prepare
      the green mixture.<br>

      </b><b>Vegetable based milk substitute&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In preparing a milk substitute, non-woody plant material, e.g
      cabbage leaves, is macerated, with water if necessary, and the
      resultant pulp filtered, preferably after agitation with
      decolourizing carbon, to produce a filtrate from which the protein
      is precipitated, e.g. by heating to 55 DEG to 90 DEG C., and
      decanted or centrifuged out to yield a slurry which is converted
      to a colloidal dispersion, e.g. using a colloid mill. The
      colloidal dispersion, which may also be prepared by vacuum
      evaporating the filtrate at or below 30 DEG C., is then blended
      with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat, e.g. maize oil,
      containing 2 to 5% by weight, of fat, a small amount of soya
      lecithin as emulsifier, and, if desired 3 to 5% of unrefined
      sugar, to produce an emulsion, preferably of droplet size 5 to 20
      m , to which further additions, e.g. of vitamins and/or mineral
      supplements, may be made. The milk-substitute emulsion may be
      dried, condensed or converted to cheese or yoghurt. A modification
      of the process comprises adding live yeast to the precipitated and
      separated protein slurry, autolysing, e.g. at 50 DEG to 55 DEG C.
      for 24 hours, separating the liquid (now containing hydrolysed
      protein) from the resultant mixture, adding to this liquid an
      amount of separated protein substantially equal to the hydrolysed
      protein it contains, and then blending the resultant suspension
      with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat.<br>
