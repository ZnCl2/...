      Here we report that aloe-emodin (AE), a hydroxyanthraquinone
      present in Aloe vera leaves, has a specific in vitro and in vivo
      antineuroectodermal tumor activity. The growth of human
      neuroectodermal tumors is inhibited in mice with severe combined

      animals. The compound does not inhibit the proliferation of normal
      fibroblasts nor that of hemopoietic progenitor cells. The
      cytotoxicity mechanism consists of the induction of apoptosis,
      whereas the selectivity against neuroectodermal tumor cells is
      founded on a specific energy-dependent pathway of drug
      incorporation. Taking into account its unique cytotoxicity profile
      and mode of action, AE might represent a conceptually new lead

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticancer effect
      of aloe-emodin, an anthraquinone compound present in the leaves of
      Aloe vera, on two distinct human gastric carcinoma cell lines, AGS
      and NCI-N87. We demonstrate that aloe-emodin induced cell death in

      Aloe-emodin caused the release of apoptosis-inducing factor and

      Aloe-emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound from the root and

      The results showed that aloe-emodin inhibited cancer cells in a
      dose-dependent manner. Treatment with aloe-emodin at 10 to 40
      microM resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. The alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) activity in KB cells increased upon treatment
      with aloe-emodin when compared to controls. This is one of the
      first studies to focus on the expression of ALP in human oral
      carcinomas cells treated with aloe-emodin. These results indicate
      that aloe-emodin has anti-cancer effect on oral cancer, which may

      Anandamide was the first brain metabolite shown to act as a ligand
      of “central” CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Here we report that the
      endogenous cannabinoid potently and selectively inhibits the
      proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Anandamide
      dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and EFM-19
      cells with IC50 values between 0.5 and 1.5 µM and 83–92% maximal
      inhibition at 5–10 µM. The proliferation of several other
      nonmammary tumoral cell lines was not affected by 10 µM
      anandamide. The anti-proliferative effect of anandamide was not
      due to toxicity or to apoptosis of cells but was accompanied by a
      reduction of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. …These data
      suggest that anandamide blocks human breast cancer cell
      proliferation through CB1-like receptor-mediated inhibition of
      endogenous prolactin action at the level of prolactin receptor.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      ANA induced a decrease of EGFR levels on LNCaP, DU145, and PC3
      prostatic cancer cells by acting through cannabinoid CB1 receptor
      subtype and this leaded to an inhibition of the EGF-stimulated
      growth of these cells. Moreover, the G1 arrest of metastatic DU145
      and PC3 growth was accompanied by a massive cell death by
      apoptosis and/or necrosis while LNCaP cells were less sensitive to
      cytotoxic effects of ANA. The apoptotic/necrotic responses induced
      by ANA on these prostatic cancer cells were also potentiated by
      the acidic ceramidase inhibitor, N-oleoylethanolamine and
      partially inhibited by the specific ceramide synthetase inhibitor,
      fumonisin B1 indicating that these cytotoxic actions of ANA might
      be induced via the cellular ceramide production. The potent
      anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of ANA on metastatic
      prostatic cancer cells might provide basis for the design of new
      therapeutic agents for effective treatment of recurrent and

      <br>
      Cell migration is of paramount importance in physiological
      processes such as immune surveillance, but also in the
      pathological processes of tumor cell migration and metastasis
      development. The factors that regulate this tumor cell migration,
      most prominently neurotransmitters, have thus been the focus of
      intense investigation. While the majority of neurotransmitters
      have a stimulatory effect on cell migration, we herein report the
      inhibitory effect of the endogenous substance anandamide on both
      tumor cell and lymphocyte migration. …Using the specific agonist
      docosatetraenoylethanolamide (DEA), we have observed that the
      norepinephrine-induced migration of colon carcinoma cells is
      inhibited by the CB1-R. The SDF-1–induced migration of CD8+ T
      lymphocytes was, however, inhibited via the CB2-R, as shown by
      using the specific agonist JWH 133. Therefore, specific inhibition
      of tumor cell migration via CB1-R engagement might be a selective
      tool to prevent metastasis formation without depreciatory effects
      on the immune system of cancer patients.<br>

      plant, Artemisia annua L. It has been shown to selectively kill
      cancer cells in vitro and retard the growth of implanted
      fibrosarcoma tumors in rats. In the present research, we
      investigated its mechanism of cytotoxicity to cancer cells. …This
      rapid induction of apoptosis in cancer cells after treatment with
      DHA indicates that artemisinin and its analogs may be inexpensive
      and effective cancer agents. <br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Artemisinin is of special biological interest because of its
      outstanding antimalarial activity. Recently, it was reported that
      artemisinin has antitumor activity. Its derivatives, artesunate,
      arteether, and artemeter, also have antitumor activity against
      melanoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, CNS, and renal cancer cell
      lines. Recently, monomer, dimer, and trimer derivatives were
      synthesized from deoxoartemisinin, and the dimers and the trimers
      were found to have much more potent antitumor activity than the
      monomers. …The deoxoartemisinin trimer was found to have greater
      antitumor effect on tumor cells than other commonly used
      chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-FU, cisplatin, and paclitaxel.
      Furthermore, the ability of artemisinin and its derivatives to
      induce apoptosis highlights their potential as chemotherapeutic
      agents, for many anticancer drugs achieve their antitumor effects
      by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells.<br>

      <br>
      Artemisinin, a natural product isolated from Artemisia annua,
      contains an endoperoxide group that can be activated by
      intracellular iron to generate toxic radical species. Cancer cells
      over-express transferrin receptors (TfR) for iron uptake while
      most normal cells express nearly undetectable levels of TfR. We
      prepared a series of artemisinin-tagged transferrins (ART-Tf)
      where different numbers of artemisinin units are attached to the
      N-glycoside chains of transferrin (Tf). The Tf bearing
      approximately 16 artemisinins retains the functionality of both Tf
      and artemisinin. Reduction of TfRs by TfR siRNA transfection
      significantly impaired the ability of ART-Tf, but not
      dihydroartemisinin, to kill cells. We also demonstrate that the
      ART-Tf conjugate kills the prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145 by
      the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.<br>

      (4E, 4G), bFGF, and VEGF. In vivo, the growth of HEp-2
      cell-transplanted tumors in nude mice was inhibited by

          for Cytotoxic Recognition by Leukocyte Complement Receptor
          Type 3 (CD11b/CD18)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ß-Glucans were identified 36 years ago as a biologic response
      modifier that stimulated tumor rejection. In vitro studies have
      shown that ß-glucans bind to a lectin domain within complement
      receptor type 3 (CR3; known also as Mac-1, CD11b/CD18, or
      Mß2-integrin, that functions as an adhesion molecule and a
      receptor for factor I-cleaved C3b, i.e., iC3b) resulting in the
      priming of this iC3b receptor for cytotoxicity of iC3b-opsonized
      target cells. This investigation explored mechanisms of tumor
      therapy with soluble ß-glucan in mice. Normal mouse sera were
      shown to contain low levels of Abs reactive with syngeneic or
      allogeneic tumor lines that activated complement, depositing C3
      onto tumors. Implanted tumors became coated with IgM, IgG, and C3,
      and the absent C3 deposition on tumors in SCID mice was
      reconstituted with IgM or IgG isolated from normal sera. Therapy
      of mice with glucan- or mannan-rich soluble polysaccharides
      exhibiting high affinity for CR3 caused a 57–90% reduction in
      tumor weight. In young mice with lower levels of tumor-reactive
      Abs, the effectiveness of ß-glucan was enhanced by administration
      of a tumor-specific mAb, and in SCID mice, an absent response to
      ß-glucan was reconstituted with normal IgM or IgG. The requirement
      for C3 on tumors and CR3 on leukocytes was highlighted by therapy
      failures in C3- or CR3-deficient mice. Thus, the tumoricidal
      function of CR3-binding polysaccharides such as ß-glucan in vivo
      is defined by natural and elicited Abs that direct iC3b deposition
      onto neoplastic cells, making them targets for circulating
      leukocytes bearing polysaccharide-primed CR3. Therapy fails when
      tumors lack iC3b, but can be restored by tumor-specific Abs that
      deposit iC3b onto the tumors. <br>

      Anti-tumor mAbs hold promise for cancer therapy, but are

      and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b,

      Exposure of B16 cells to betulinic acid, 23-hydroxybetulinic acid

      demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, gel electrophoresis and

      that both 3-oxo-23-hydroxybetulinic acid and 23-hydroxybetulinic

      </b>Neuroblastoma has long been recognized to show spontaneous
      regression during fetal development and in the majority of stage
      4s infants &lt;1 year of age with disseminated disease. Stage 4s
      disease regresses with no chemotherapy in 50% of the patients. The
      mechanism by which this occurs is not understood but may be
      programmed cell death or apoptosis. Betulinic acid (BA) has been
      reported to induce apoptosis in human melanoma with in vitro and

      <br>
      Blueberries are a rich source of phenylpropanoid-derived
      phytochemicals, widely studied for their potential health
      benefits. Of particular interest for colonic health are the lower
      molecular weight phenolic acids and their derivatives, as these
      are the predominant phenolic compounds detected in the colon.
      Blueberries contained a wide variety of phenolic acids, the
      majority of which (3371.14 ± 422.30 mg/kg compared to 205.06 ±
      45.34 mg/kg for the free phenolic acids) were attached to other
      plant cell-wall components and therefore, likely to become
      available in the colon. Cytokine-induced stimulation of the
      inflammatory pathways in colon cells was four-fold up-regulated in
      the presence of the free phenolic acid fraction. Incubation of the
      bound phenolic acids with human faecal slurries resulted in
      qualitative and quantitative differences in the phenolic compounds
      recovered. The metabolites obtained by incubation with faecal
      slurries from one volunteer significantly decreased (1.67 ± 0.69
      ng/cm3) prostanoid production, whereas an increase (10.78 ± 5.54
      ng/cm3) was obtained with faecal slurries from another volunteer.
      These results suggest that any potential protective effect of
      blueberry phenolics as anti-inflammatory agents in the colon is a
      likely result of microbial metabolism. Studies addressing a
      wide-range of well-characterised human volunteers will be required
      before such health claims can be fully established.<br>

          Cancer T24 Cells Through Reactive Oxygen Species Production
          and Mitochondrial Depolarization</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      RESULTS: CAP decreased the viability of T24 cells in a
      dose-dependent manner without marked apoptosis. CAP induced ROS
      production and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, thereby
      inducing cell death, not apoptosis, in T24 cells at a
      concentration of 100 microM or higher. Furthermore, these effects
      of CAP could be reversed by capsazepine, the antagonist of
      transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channel. In vivo
      experiment showed that CAP significantly slowed the growth of T24
      bladder cancer xenografts as measured by size (661.80 +/- 62.03 vs
      567.02 +/- 43.94 mm(3); P &lt;.01).<br>
      CONCLUSIONS: CAP mediates cell death in T24 cells through calcium
      entry-dependent ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization,
      and it may have a role in the management of bladder cancer.<br>

      vitamins A, C, D and E and various carotenoids, including alpha-

      alpha-carotene, from food and supplements were significantly and
      inversely associated with risk for ovarian cancer, predominantly

      </div>
      <br>
      On Tuesday, the British Journal of Cancer published a propitious
      study from Cork Cancer Research Centre (“CCRC”) at the University
      College Cork in Ireland that found that curcumin—a compound in the
      curry spice turmeric—begins killing esophageal cancer cells within
      24 hours. According to the CCRC study, curcumin ostensibly acts as
      a free radical scavenger that triggers a lethal cell death signal
      that causes cancerous cells in the throat to digest and kill
      themselves.<br>

      </b>This study investigated the cellular and molecular changes
      induced by curcumin leading to the induction of apoptosis in human
      lung cancer cell lines—A549 and H1299. A549 is p53 proficient and
      H1299 is p53 null mutant. The lung cancer cells were treated with
      curcumin (0–160 µM) for 12–72 h. Curcumin inhibited the growth of
      both the cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. Growth
      inhibition of H1299 cell lines was both time and concentration
      dependent. Curcumin induced apoptosis in both the lung cancer cell
      lines. A decrease in expression of p53, bcl-2, and bcl-XL was
      observed after 12 h exposure of 40 µM curcumin. Bak and Caspase
      genes remained unchanged up to 60 µM curcumin but showed decrease
      in expression levels at 80–160 µM. The data also suggest a p53
      independent induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells.<br>

      <br>
      The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms of
      curcumin-induced human breast cancer cell apoptosis. From
      quantitative image analysis data showing an increase in the
      percentage of cells with a sub-G0/G1 DNA content, we demonstrated
      curcumin-induced apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7,
      in which expression of wild-type p53 could be induced. Apoptosis
      was accompanied by an increase in p53 level as well as its
      DNA-binding activity followed by Bax expression at the protein
      level. Further experiments using p53-null MDAH041 cell as well as
      low and high p53-expressing TR9-7 cell, in which p53 expression is
      under tight control of tetracycline, established that curcumin
      induced apoptosis in tumor cells via a p53-dependent pathway in
      which Bax is the downstream effector of p53. This property of
      curcumin suggests that this molecule could have a possible
      therapeutic potential in breast cancer patients.<br>

      Curcumin, an active ingredient from the rhizome of the plant,

      activities. It has recently been demonstrated that the
      chemopreventive activities of curcumin might be due to its ability
      to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In the present study,
      we have investigated the effects of curcumin on growth and
      apoptosis in the human ovarian cancer cell line Ho-8910 by MTT
      assay, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and Western
      blotting. Our data revealed that curcumin could significantly

      <br>
      The CKII inhibitory compound was purified from the fruit of
      Xanthium strumarium by organic solvent extraction and silica gel
      chromatography. The inhibitory compound was identified as
      3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde by analysis with FT-IR, FAB-Mass,
      EI-Mass, (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
      inhibited the phosphotransferase activity of CKII with IC(50) of
      about 783 microM. Steady-state studies revealed that the inhibitor
      acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate ATP.
      A value of 138.6 microM was obtained for the apparent K(i).
      Concentration of 300 microM 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde caused 50%
      growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937.
      3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde-induced cell death was characterised
      with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3.
      Furthermore, the inhibitor induced the fragmentation of DNA into
      multiples of 180 bp, indicating that it triggered apoptosis. This
      induction of apoptosis by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was also
      confirmed by using flow cytometry analysis. Since CKII is involved
      in cell proliferation and oncogenesis, these results suggest that
      3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde may function by inhibiting oncogenic
      disease, at least in part, through the inhibition of CKII

      Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an active
      herbal component traditionally used in China for treating various

      cell lines and the actual molecular mechanism of which is still
      not clear. Since apoptosis could be a potential mechanism to

      in human cervical cancer cells. Our results suggest that emodin
      exerts antiproliferative effects in human cervical cancer cells.
      Emodin inhibited DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis as
      demonstrated by increased nuclear condensation, annexin binding
      and DNA fragmentation in Bu 25TK cells in the presence of emodin.
      Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time in human cervical
      cancer cells that the apoptotic pathway involved in emodin-induced
      apoptosis is caspase-dependent and presumably through the
      mitochondrial pathway, as shown by the activation of caspases-3,

      Green tea and its major constituent epigallocatechin gallate

      suggested that EGCG may provide protective effects against hormone

      and alters the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins that
      are critical for cell survival and apoptosis. This review will
      highlight the important in vitro mechanistic actions elicited by
      EGCG in various breast and prostate cancer cell lines.

      <br>
      Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and ninth
      most common in women. It has a protracted course of progression
      and is thus an ideal candidate for chemoprevention strategies and
      trials. This study was conducted to evaluate the
      chemopreventive/antiproliferative potential of
      (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, the major phytochemical in
      green tea) against bladder cancer and its mechanism of action.
      Using the T24 human bladder cancer cell line, we found that EGCG
      treatment caused dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cellular
      proliferation and cell viability, and induced apoptosis.
      Mechanistically, EGCG inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt
      activation that, in turn, results in modulation of Bcl-2 family
      proteins, leading to enhanced apoptosis of T24 cells. These

      The antitumor activity of fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus was

      polysaccharide composed predominantly of sulfated fucose, markedly
      inhibited the growth of HCT-15 cells (human colon carcinoma

      and increase of the population of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells were
      observed. …Furthermore, the induction of apoptosis was also
      accompanied by a strong activation of extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase and an inactivation
      of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in a time-dependent
      manner. These findings provide evidence demonstrating that the
      pro-apoptotic effect of fucoidan is mediated through the

      Fucoidan is an active component of seaweed that has been shown to
      inhibit proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death in several

      process have not yet been elucidated. In the present report, we

      fucoidan reduced the viable cell number of MCF-7 cells in a dose-
      and time-dependent manner. In contrast, fucoidan did not affect
      the viable cell number of normal human mammary epithelial cells.
      Results from the apoptosis assay demonstrated that fucoidan
      induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, chromatin

      Fucoidan-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of
      caspase-3 and was partially prevented by pretreatment with a
      pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. The mitochondrial potential in
      HS-Sultan cells was decreased 24 hr after treatment with fucoidan,
      indicating that fucoidan induced apoptosis through a mitochondrial
      pathway. When HS-Sultan was treated with 100 mg/mL fucoidan for 24
      hr, phosphorylation of ERK and GSK markedly decreased. In
      contrast, phosphorylation of p38 and Akt was not altered by
      treatment with fucoidan. L-Selectin and P-selectin are known to be
      receptors of fucoidan; however, as HS-Sultan does not express
      either of these selectins, it is unlikely that fucoidan induced
      apoptosis through them in HS-Sultan. The neutralizing antibody,
      Dreg56, against human L-selectin did not prevent the inhibitory
      effect of fucoidan on the proliferation of IM9 and MOLT4 cells,
      both of which express L-selectin; thus it is possible fucoidan
      induced apoptosis though different receptors. These results

      was significantly downregulated by 1.0 mg/ml of fucoidan, whereas
      CXCR4 mRNA expression was unchanged by fucoidan. CXCL12 and CXCR4
      mRNA were barely expressed in HepG2 cells. In addition, 1.0 mg/ml
      of fucoidan mildly arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis
      in Huh7 cells. The findings suggest that fucoidan exhibits

      </b>Resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
      ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis has been reported in some cancer
      cells, including AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Hizikia
      fusiforme is a commonly used brown seaweed species in Korea that

      activities. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with
      TRAIL in combination with subtoxic concentrations of ethyl alcohol
      extract of H. fusiforme (EAHF) sensitized TRAIL-resistant AGS
      cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Combined treatment with EAHF

      The present study was undertaken to determine if (a) genistein
      induces topo II-mediated DNA damage in HT-29 colon cancer cells;
      and (b) if this damage is required to induce apoptosis. DNA damage
      was evaluated using the comet assay. Apoptosis was determined by
      the ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining technique. DNA
      breakage was noted within 1 h of treatment. Apoptosis was only
      induced with high concentrations (&gt;/=60 microM) of genistein.
      Marked inhibition of HT-29 cell growth was evident at
      concentrations ranging from 60 to 150 microM. This was associated
      with a cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M. Similar findings were obtained
      in SW-620 and SW-1116 colon cancer cell lines. Aclarubicin, a topo
      II antagonist, reduced genistein-induced DNA breaks but did not
      reduce apoptosis. These data suggest that, in colon cancer cells,
      topo II serves as the enzymatic target of genistein. Furthermore,

      We found that 6-gingerol, a phenolic alkanone isolated from

      slightly. 6-Gingerol facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
      increasing TRAIL-induced caspase-3/7 activation. 6-Gingerol was
      shown to down-regulate the expression of cIAP1, which suppresses
      caspase-3/7 activity, by inhibiting TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB
      activation. As 6-shogaol has a chemical structure similar to
      6-gingerol, we also assessed the effect of 6-shogaol on the
      viability of gastric cancer cells. Unlike 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol

      <br>
      Our previous study demonstrated that the in vivo anti-metastatic
      effect induced by oral administration of ginseng protopanaxadiol
      saponins was mediated by their metabolic component M1, and that
      the growth, invasion and migration of tumor cells were inhibited
      by M1 but not by ginsenosides. Here we investigated the inhibitory
      mechanism of M1 on the growth of tumor cells. M1 inhibited the
      proliferation of B16-BL6 mouse melanoma cells in a time- and
      dose-dependent manner, with accompanying morphological changes at
      the concentration of 20 microM. In addition, at 40 microM M1
      induced apoptotic cell death within 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy
      revealed that dansyl M1 entered the cytosol and quickly reached
      the nuclei (approximately 15 min). Western blot analysis revealed
      that M1 rapidly up-regulated the expression of p27Kip1, but
      down-regulated the expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in a
      time-dependent manner. Thus, the regulation of apoptosis-related
      proteins by M1 is responsible for the induction of apoptotic cell
      death, and this probably leads to the anti-metastatic activity in
      vivo.<br>

      The mean concentrations of IH-901 needed to inhibit the

      S and/or G2/M arrest in SW480 cell cycle progression. GSE also
      induced Cip/p21 levels in all 3 cell lines. Furthermore, an

      Although MDM2 inhibits tumor-suppressor function of p53, there

      attractive therapeutic strategy. Hispolon extracted from Phellinus
      species was found to induce epidermoid and gastric cancer cell
      apoptosis. …The results indicated that cells with higher ERK1/2
      activity were more sensitive to hispolon. In addition,
      hispolon-induced caspase-7 cleavage was inhibited by the ERK1/2

      <br>
      Cellular damage induced by chronic inflammation is a well known
      cause of colon carcinogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the
      enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostanoids, is known to
      play an important role in inflammation. Herbal flavonoid
      isoliquiritigenin (ILTG) has previously been reported to be a
      strong suppresser of the COX-2 pathway as well as an inducer of
      apoptosis. Here we report that the susceptibility to apoptosis by
      ILTG is dependent on the level of COX-2 in mouse colon
      adenocarcinoma Colon 26, which spontaneously expresses COX-2. This
      dependency was observed to be enhanced by blockage of the
      lipoxigenases (LOXs)-mediated metabolic pathway and attenuated by
      addition of a number of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Taken

      Transfection experiments reveal that ISL is able to transactivate
      the endogenous ER alpha in MCF7 cells and this is supported by the
      capability to induce down-regulation of ER alpha protein levels
      and up-regulation of pS2 mRNA. Moreover, by using chimeric
      proteins consisting of the hormone binding domains of ER alpha and
      ER beta fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, we have determined
      that ISL is an estrogenic agonist of both ER isoforms. As a
      biological counterpart, low and intermediate ISL concentrations
      that induce substantial transcriptional activity stimulate the
      proliferation of MCF7 cells. However, high levels of ISL become
      cytotoxic even in steroid-receptor negative HeLa cells. Thus, the
      activity of ISL and the balance between risk or chemopreventive

      Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is an active constituent

      produce anti-tumor activities. However, the apoptosis-inducing
      activity of luteolin still remains unknown. Flavonoids have been
      found to possess prooxidant and antioxidant action. The biological
      and pharmacological effect of flavonoid may depend upon its
      behavior as either an antioxidant or a prooxidant. Our experiments
      found that luteolin-induced CH27 cell apoptosis was accompanied by
      activation of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase
      and catalase, but not through the production of reactive oxygen
      species and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential.
      Therefore, the effects of luteolin on CH27 cell apoptosis were

      </div>
      <br>
      Luteolin, a flavonoid isolated from the fruit of Vitex
      rotundifolia, has been examined with regard to the inhibition of
      proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human myeloid
      leukaemia HL-60 cells. The concentration required for 50%
      inhibition of the growth after 96 h was 15 +/- 1.1 microM. The
      mode of cell death induced by luteolin was found to be apoptosis,
      as judged by the morphologic alteration of the cells and by the
      detection of DNA fragmentation using agarose gel electrophoresis.
      The degree of apoptosis was quantified by a sandwich enzyme
      immunoassay and flow cytometric analysis. These results suggest
      that luteolin may be used as potential chemopreventive and
      chemotherapeutic agents.<br>

      In addition, it showed that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was
      activated after the treatment of luteolin for 3-12 h. Further
      investigation showed that a specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125,
      reduced the activation of CPP 32, the mitochondrial translocation
      of Bax, as well as the cytosolic release of cytochrome c that
      induced by luteolin. Finally, the apoptosis induced by luteolin
      was suppressed by a pretreatment with SP600125 via evaluating

      Male mice were implanted subcutaneously with a suspension of Colon

      E and Q inhibited the O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin (EROD)
      catalysed by cytochrome P450 CYPIA. In contrast, M increased the

      NADPH cytochrome c reductase and glutathione reductase, while E
      increased only NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity. The effects
      on enzyme activities in vitro suggest that there is not only the
      potential for flavonoids to alter metabolic activation of
      carcinogens but also of therapeutically administered drugs in

      Recent epidemiological evidence and animal studies suggest a

      induced an appreciable apoptosis in HL60 cells after 24 h of
      incubation as evidenced by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy
      and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. … These results support
      the hypothesis that hydroxytyrosol may exert a protective activity
      against cancer by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis

      dose-dependent manner. Cf-PS-treated AGS cells exhibited a marked
      increase in caspase-3 activation and a decrease in Bcl-2
      expression. In addition, phosphorylation of insulin-like growth
      factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) was decreased in Cf-PS-treated AGS
      cells as compared to non-treated control cells, which is
      consistent with PI3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation. Cf-PS also
      decreased IGF-I-stimulated recruitment of p85 to IGF-IR and IRS-1.
      These results indicate that Cf-PS inhibits cell proliferation and

      <br>
      The biological activities of the polysaccharide have attracted
      more and more attention in the biochemical and medical areas due
      to their anti-cancer effects. To estimate the anti-tumor mechanism
      of MAP, a novel polysaccharide from the loach, Misgurnus
      anguillicaudatus, the apoptosis effects of the polysaccharide on
      the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (SMMC-7721 cells) were
      studied. The present studies showed that MAP could induce cell
      apoptosis which was closely accompanied with an increase of
      intracellular-free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), the
      enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, dissipation of
      mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), up-regulation of p53 mRNA,
      increase expression of Bax mRNA, and decrease expression of Bcl-2
      mRNA. These results suggested that cell apoptosis induced by MAP
      mainly was mediated by mitochondrial pathways, not involved death
      receptors (DRs) pathways. The mechanism possibly is that MAP acts
      on mitochondria and boosts ROS, ROS mediates a release of Ca2+
      from the intracellular Ca2+ pool, increasing [Ca2+]i targets the
      cells a start-up of the apoptosis program.<br>

      suppressed TNFa-induced COX-2 protein expression by 79% (SE =
      0.042), total pomegranate tannin extract (TPT) 55% (SE = 0.049),
      and punicalagin 48% (SE = 0.022). Additionally, PJ reduced

      punicalagin 3.6-fold, whereas ellagic acid (EA) (another

      </div>
      <br>
      Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine,
      displays anti-cancer activities through a variety of mechanisms
      that include the induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Although high
      concentrations may be needed for the efficacy of resveratrol
      alone, the compound shows promise as a potent sensitizer of the
      apoptotic effect of other anti-cancer agents, including death
      ligand TRAIL. Intracellular heat shock proteins (Hsps) are
      frequently up-regulated in cancer cells, conferring resistance to
      apoptosis. Modulation of these proteins may overcome the
      resistance and increase efficacy of anticancer therapies. In this
      study, resveratrol caused significant dose-dependent apoptosis or
      necrosis in the lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia cell lines Jurkat
      and U937 at 50µM and above.<br>

      lines (17A, 17B, 22A, 22B, 38, SqCC/Y1, and 1483). Six of the

      The results showed that the growth of SGC-7901 cells was strongly
      inhibited by the ethanolic extracts at the concentration ranging
      between 0.31-5.00 mg/ml, and the apoptosis of treated cells was
      induced at the concentration of 1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mg/ml in

      The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor
      activity of a lectin from Sophora flavescens and explore its
      potential apoptotic induction mechanism. …In conclusion, all
      experimental results demonstrated that this lectin seems to be a
      potent anti-tumor agent for its cytotoxicity and apoptosis effects
      on HeLa cells. Also, bioinformatics analyses showed that this

      Screening of various natural products in a search for novel

      the strong apoptosis-inducing activity in a fraction extracted
      with methanol from the roots of Sophora subprostrata Chun et T.
      Chen. We purified the compound that induced apoptosis in human
      leukemia cells and identified it as sophoranone. Sophoranone
      inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in various lines of
      cells from human solid tumors, with 50% inhibition of growth of
      human stomach cancer MKN7 cells at 1.2 ± 0.3 µM. The
      growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities of sophoranone
      for leukemia U937 cells were very much stronger than those of
      other flavonoids, such as daidzein, genistein and quercetin.<br>

      Matrine, one of the main active components from the dry roots of

      Further immunoblots revealed that in Matrine-treated cells,
      caspase-3, -7 were activated and the pro-apoptotic molecules Bok,
      Bak, Bax, Puma, and Bim were also up-regulated. Our results

      The Chinese herbal medicine Radix Sophorae is widely applied as an

      this study, Leachianone A, isolated from Radix Sophorae, possessed
      a profound cytotoxic activity against human hepatoma cell line
      HepG2 in vitro, with an IC(50) value of 3.4microg/ml post-48-h
      treatment. Its action mechanism via induction of apoptosis
      involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Its anti-tumor
      effect was further demonstrated in vivo by 17-54% reduction of
      tumor size in HepG2-bearing nude mice, in which no toxicity to the

      <br>
      A total of eleven stilbenes [1-6] and flavonoids [7-11] were
      investigated for their tumor-specific cytotoxicity and
      apoptosis-inducing activity, using four human tumor cell lines
      (squamous cell carcinoma HSC-2, HSC-3, submandibular gland
      carcinoma HSG and promyelocytic leukemia HL-60) and three normal
      human oral cells (gingival fibroblast HGF, pulp cell HPC,
      periodontal ligament fibroblast HPLF). All of the compounds,
      especially sophorastilbene A [1], (+)-a-viniferin [2], piceatannol
      [5], quercetin [9] and isoliquiritigenin [10], showed higher
      cytotoxicity against the tumor cell lines than normal cells,
      yielding tumor-specific indices of 3.6, 4.7, &gt;3.5, &gt;3.3 and
      4.0, respectively. Among the seven cell lines, HSC-2 and HL-60
      cells were the most sensitive to the cytotoxic action of these
      compounds. Sophorastilbene A [1], piceatannol [5], quercetin [9]
      and isoliquiritigenin [10] induced internucleosomal DNA
      fragmentation and activation of caspases -3, -8 and -9
      dose-dependently in HL-60 cells. (+)-a-Viniferin [2] showed
      similar activity, but only at higher concentrations. All the
      compounds failed to induce DNA fragmentation and activated
      caspases to much lesser extents in HSC-2 cells. Western blot
      analysis showed that sophorastilbene A [1], piceatannol [5] and
      quercetin [9] did not induce any consistent changes in the
      expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad) and anti-apoptotic
      protein (Bcl-2) in HL-60 and HSC-2 cells. An undetectable
      expression of Bcl-2 protein in control and drug-treated HSC-2
      cells may explain the relatively higher sensitivity of this cell
      line to stilbenes and flavonoids.<br>

      Little is known about the activity of cannabinoids like THC on

      The exposure of human stomach cancer KATO III cells to black tea
      theaflavin extract, free theaflavin, and theaflavin digallate that
      are main components of the extract, led to both growth inhibition
      and the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
      Morphological changes showing apoptotic bodies were observed in
      the cells treated with black tea theaflavin extract, theaflavin
      and theaflavin digallate. The fragmentations by these theaflavin
      compounds of DNA to oligonucleosomal-sized fragments that are
      characteristics of apoptosis were observed to be concentration-

      the ethnobotany, pharmacology and phytochemistry of this genus.
      During the past 20 years, alkaloids, terpenes, quinovic acid

      Uncaria. Fifty-three novel structures are reported in this review.
      The species in which the largest number of compounds has been
      identified is the Peruvian Uncaria tomentosa or ‘cat’s claw.’
      Pharmacological studies are described according to cytotoxicity,
      anti-inflammatory, antiviral, immunostimulation, antioxidant,
      CNS-related response, vascular, hypotensive, mutagenicity and
      antibacterial properties. The potential for development of leads

      Natural products are still an untapped source of promising lead
      compounds for the generation of antineoplastic drugs. Here, we
      investigated for the first time the antiproliferative and
      apoptotic effects of highly purified oxindole alkaloids, namely
      isopteropodine (A1), pteropodine (A2), isomitraphylline (A3),
      uncarine F (A4) and mitraphylline (A5) obtained from Uncaria
      tomentosa, a South American Rubiaceae, on human lymphoblastic
      leukaemia T cells (CCRF-CEM-C7H2). Four of the five tested
      alkaloids inhibited proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
      cells. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effect of the most
      potent alkaloids pteropodine (A2) and uncarine F (A4) correlated
      with induction of apoptosis. After 48 h, 100 µmol/l A2 or A4
      increased apoptotic cells by 57%. CEM-C7H2 sublines with
      tetracycline-regulated expression of bcl-2, p16ink4A or

      show the strong apoptotic effects of pteropodine and uncarine F on

      </div>
      <br>
      In this paper, we report the anticancer activities of Uncaria
      rhynchophylla extracts, a Rubiaceae plant native to China.
      Traditionally, Uncaria rhynchophylla has been used in the
      prevention and treatment of neurotoxicity. However, the cytotoxic
      activity of Uncaria rhynchophylla against human colon carcinoma
      cells has not, until now, been elucidated. We found that the
      methanolic extract of Uncaria rhynchophylla (URE) have cytotoxic
      effects on HT-29 cells. The URE showed highly cytotoxic effects
      via the MTT reduction assay, LDH release assay, and colony
      formation assay. As expected, URE inhibited the growth of HT-29
      cells in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, the methanolic
      URE of the 500 µg/ml showed 15.8% inhibition against growth of
      HT-29 cells. It induced characteristic apoptotic effects in HT-29
      cells, including chromatin condensation and sharking occurring 24
      h when the cells were treated at a concentration of the 500 µg/ml.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a rare calcitonin-producing
      tumor, is derived from parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid and
      is characterized by constitutive Bcl-2 overexpression. The tumor
      is relatively insensitive to radiation therapy as well as
      conventional chemotherapy. To date, the only curative treatment is
      the early and complete surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue.
      In this study, the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of
      fractions obtained from Uncaria tomentosa (Willd.) DC, commonly
      known as uña de gato or cat’s claw were investigated. Cell growth
      of MTC cells as well as enzymatic activity of mitochondrial
      dehydrogenase was markedly inhibited after treatment with
      different fractions of the plant. Furthermore, there was an
      increase in the expressions of caspase-3 and -7 and
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fraction, while bcl-2
      overexpression remained constant. In particular, the alkaloids
      isopterpodine and pteropodine of U. tomentosa exhibited a
      significant pro-apoptotic effect on MTC cells, whereas the
      alkaloid-poor fraction inhibited cell proliferation but did not
      show any pro-apoptotic effects. These promising results indicate
      the growth-restraining and apoptotic potential of plant extracts
      against neuroendocrine tumors, which may add to existing therapies
      for cancer.<br>

      necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and nitric

      growth and metastasis in the C57BL/6 mouse, and d) nuclear factor
      ?B (NF-?B) activity in LPS-stimulated HeLa cells. UT did not show
      an important cytotoxic effect in vitro at the doses up to 300
      µg/ml, but did inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. UT
      inhibited TNF-a, IL-6 and NO production in vitro. NF-?B activity
      was also inhibited. Our studies show that UT merits further study

      <br>
      A family of compounds found in cruciferous vegetables, such as
      broccoli, cauliflower, and watercress, blocked lung cancer
      progression in both animal studies and in tests with human lung
      cancer cells, report researchers from Georgetown University
      Medical Center and the Institute for Cancer Prevention. They say
      the results, published in a set of papers in the September 15
      issue of Cancer Research, suggest that these chemicals — put into
      a veggie pill of sorts — might some day be used to help current
      and former smokers ward off development of lung cancer, the
      leading cause of cancer death in Americans.<br>

      willow extract and death was delayed (for 35 days). In vitro the

      among primary cells harvested from seven patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 13 with AML (acute myeloid
      leukemia). DNA fragmentation patterns within treated cells
      inferred targeted cell death by apoptosis had occurred. The

      Limited in vitro studies indicate that several prenylated

      anticarcinogenic properties. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the anti-tumorigenic effects of xanthohumol (XN), the
      major prenylflavonoid in hops, on prostate cancer and benign
      prostate hyperplasia. …XN and its oxygenated derivative also
      induced cell cycle changes in both cells lines, seen in an
      elevated sub G1 peak at 48h treatment. Western blot analysis was
      performed to confirm the activation of proapoptotic proteins, Bax
      and p53. XN and its derivative caused decreased activation of
      NFkappaB. This work suggests that XN and its oxidation product,
      XAL, may be potentially useful as a chemopreventive agent during
      prostate hyperplasia and prostate carcinogenesis, acting via
      induction of apoptosis and down-regulation of NFkappaB activation

      </div>
      <br>
      Xanthohumol (XN), a natural polyphenol present in beer, is known
      to exert anti-cancer effects. However, its precise mechanisms are
      not yet clearly defined. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the effect of oral administration of XN in breast cancer
      xenografts in nude mice. …Oral administration of XN to nude mice
      inoculated with MCF7 cells resulted in central necrosis within
      tumours, reduced inflammatory cell number, focal proliferation
      areas, increased percentage of apoptotic cells and decreased
      microvessel density. Anti-angiogenic effects of XN were further
      confirmed by immunoblotting for factor VIII expression in
      XN-treated tumours as compared to controls. Decreased
      immunostaining for NF?B, phosphorylated-inhibitor of kappa B and
      interleukin-1ß were also observed as well as a significant
      decrease in NF?B activity to 60% of control values. These novel
      findings indicate that XN is able to target both breast cancer and
      host cells, namely inflammatory and endothelial cells, suggesting
      its potential use as a double-edge anti-cancer agent.<br>

      Based on these observations, lymphocytes from patients with B-CLL
      were cultured in the presence of XA in vitro. XA induced a
      dose-dependent killing of B-CLL cells at an LD50(24 h) of 24.4 ±
      6.6 µM, independent of known adverse prognostic factors including
      functional loss of p53. Cell death was associated with poly
      (ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage and annexin V positivity,
      suggestive of an apoptotic mechanism. Surprisingly, p70S6K
      phosphorylation was stimulated upon XA treatment. In conclusion,
      XA has an antitumor activity on B-CLL cells in vitro. The
      molecular mechanisms behind this pro-apoptotic effect deserve
      further investigation.<br>
