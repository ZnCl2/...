      <br>
      A 1975 Ford statio wagon was driven from New to washington rcently
      with its gas tank filled with HydroFuel.<br>
      <br>
      HydroFuel is about 45 % crude alcohol, 45% medium octane gasoline,
      and 10 % water."The entire mixture is made into a clear fuel by
      adding a few percent Hydrelate", Alfred Globus said.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Globus is co-counder and president of United International
      Research, inc., an independent research firm on Long Island.<br>
      <br>
      If his new fuel proves out, the impact our economy would be
      tremendous. In mass production Hydrofuel would sell for less than
      50 cents a gallon and would save 1million gallons of gasoline a
      day, Dr Globus says.<br>
      <br>
      The prospect of HydroFuel being everything Dr Globus hopes it is
      are slim, if for no other reason than many ideas of this nature
      pop up and inevitably (seemingly) fail.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Offers Credentials</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr Globus, however, has credentials. he is a former teacher of
      biochemistry at Fairleigh Dickinson University. United
      International is affiliated with Guardian Chemical Corp. United
      International's Polycomplex, which enables oil to with water, was
      used to clean up the great Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969<br>
      <br>
      A lto of schemes that didn't work involved mixing water and
      alcohol with gasoline. For years engineers have known that adding
      water to gasoline improves combustion. In World War 2, water was
      injected into the cylinders of planes for increasing power during
      takeoff.<br>
      <br>
      More recently, water tanks have been put on cars for injection at
      ignition. It is clumsy, and in cold weather the water freezes.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Globus claims to have solved the problem with his Hydrelate,
      synthetic compound made partly from coal. His fuel is mixed at the
      refinery or at a distributor's station and may be handles at
      stations just like regular gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      That '75 Ford wagon is a stock model with 60,000 miles on it. Six
      thousand were tun with the first version of Hydrofuel,and 6000
      more were driven with the present HydroFuel. Dr Globus says the
      car gets approximately one mile a gallon less than with regular
      gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      "The oil companies, with their large gas refining capacity, are
      not too enthusiastic about our product", Dr Globus said.<br>
      <br>
      "The entire fuel-water, alcohol and gasoline mixed with the
      Hydrelate -- would cost 20 to 25 % less than unleaded gas if it
      were made in carload quantities".<br>
      <br>
      If oil companies aren't enthusiastic, the auto companies are. No
      modifications of existing autos are needed. The fuel would solve
      many, maybe all, of their problems in meeting anti-pollution
      standards. Catalytic converters might be unnecessary. The fuel
      could be the savior of Detroit's prime money maker, the big car.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fuel For Heating</b><br>
      <br>
      During the winter the oil furnace at United International burns
      Hydroleum, which is 90% fuel oil and 10% water by the same
      Hydrelate.<br>
      <br>
      I could conceive of the fuel being used in airplanes, too", Dr
      Globus said.<br>
      <br>
      ""I've had it in containers as long as three months with no sign
      of separation. We've operated at 20 degrees below zero showing no
      sign of crystallization, and it would be good to 30 below.<br>
      <br>
      "Two foreign countries -- one in a part of South America where a
      lot of sugar is grown, the other an Arab country -- have expressed
      interest in the process. The alcohol come from cellulose, such as
      sugar cane or corn stalks.<br>
      <br>
      One of these times there's going to bea breakthrough in
      supplementing gasoline. "I had a call from a major sugar
      producer", Dr Globus remarked. "He said some day the waste they
      now throw away might be worth more than the sugar is."<br>

          <b>Stabilization of ethanol-gasoline mixtures</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      1982-05-04<br>
      <br>
      A stabilized composition of matter comprising a fuel oil, such as
      gasoline, ethanol, small amounts of water and a stabilizing amount
      of an additive which is substantially insoluble in water, but
      which is soluble in ethyl alcohol and gasoline and is effective to
      prevent the separation of the gasoline-ethyl alcohol solution into
      two distinct phases; said additive being n-hexylalcohol,
      hereinafter, n-hexanol. The invention also includes a method for
      stabilizing gasoline, that is, for preventing or retarding the
      phase separation of gasoline-ethanol mixtures in the presence of
      small amounts of water, and this being the case when the
      temperature of the gasoline-ethanol mixture has been reduced to
      below 20 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to the stabilization of gasoline which has
      been diluted with ethanol, i.e. stretched with ethanol containing
      3-4% water and which solutions are subject to separation.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the relative shortage and high cost of gasoline, it is
      desirable to provide some method and means which will stabilize
      gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures, thereby allowing the
      gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures to function at their fullest
      efficiency, i.e., to exist as a single phase and this even when
      the ambient temperatures fall below 20 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, it would be desirable to provide some method and
      means which will stabilize gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures,
      wherein the alcohol is ethyl alcohol containing small amounts of
      water, for instance 3-4%, and is present in an amount of 10% or
      more and preferably above 20%, so that the phase separation which
      would normally occur is avoided and the mixture maintained as a
      single phase.<br>
      <br>
      The use of ethyl alcohol as an extender for gasoline has been
      proposed. However the successful use of ethyl alcohol has been
      limited to those instances where the alcohol has been
      substantially anhydrous. In the presence of even small amounts of
      water, the ethyl alcohol is no longer miscible with gasoline,
      bringing about a separation into two phases, especially when there
      is a drop in ambient temperature. When this occurs, i.e., when the
      separation into two phases takes place, the bottom phase which
      consists of water and alcohol is corrosive to the steel brought
      into contact therewith and in particular the gas tank, pumps,
      holding tank, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This invention contemplates the use of ethanol which is not
      anhydrous, but which instead contains 3-4% water. Such alcohol is
      made by simple distillation methods, instead of the expensive
      azeotropic distillation procedures which require more energy and
      the use of costly materials. In addition, the presence of the
      water introduced with the gasoline-ethanol mixture when used for
      example in the conventional engine gives rise to an increased
      octane rating.<br>
      <br>
      The use of an alcohol to hold ethanol and small amounts of water
      in gasoline solution has already been proposed. Thus it has been
      suggested to use alcohols such as i-propanol and i-butanol because
      they are miscible both with water and gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has now found that the use of an alcohol such as
      n-hexanol, which is substantially insoluble in water but which is
      instead soluble in both gasoline and ethanol has numerous
      advantages in forming a stable liquid and preventing separation of
      the gasoline and alcohol. The hexanol is 1-hexanol i.e., the
      straight chain alcohol, since it has been found that branching
      materially reduces the effectiveness of this alcohol as a
      stabilizer, the reduction in effectiveness bearing a direct
      relationship to the amount of branching present.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of this invention to provide compositions
      comprising a fuel oil, i.e., gasoline and ethanol which
      compositions are stable against separation into more than one
      phase and that in the presence of small amounts of water and that
      particularly in the event of a drop in ambient temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a method for
      preventing or retarding the separation into more than one phase of
      gasoline-ethanol solutions in the presence of small amounts of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      It is still another object of this invention to provide
      compositions of matter comprising a high grade fuel oil i.e.
      gasoline, ethanol and a stabilizing agent therefore.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of this invention to provide an additive
      especially adapted for stabilizing gasoline, particularly mixtures
      of gasoline and ethanol in the presence of small amounts of water
      comprising n-hexanol per se or in the form of its solution in the
      gasoline and/or ethanol. The n-hexanol serves to "couple" the
      ethanol to the gasoline, forming a stable liquid and preventing
      separation even in the presence of small amounts of water.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages will become more apparent
      as the description thereof proceeds.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with this invention, the above objects and
      advantages are accomplished by the addition to a fuel oil i.e.
      gasoline-ethanol solution containing small amounts of water of a
      stabilizing amount of an additive which is both alcohol and
      gasoline miscible and/or soluble and is effective to prevent the
      separation of the gasoline-ethanol solution into two distinct
      phases and namely by using as additive n-hexanol. It is possible
      in accordance with the invention to employ a mixture of n-hexanol
      with its isomers such as methyl pentanol, ethyl butanol or the
      like, but as noted above such mixtures have not been found to be
      as effective as n-hexanol. Therefore, if n-hexanol is not readily
      available for the purposes of the invention, it has been found
      satisfactory to employ n-hexanol and the mixed isomers thereof, as
      for example produced in the oxo-process. The n-hexanol and/or
      isomers thereof act to couple the alcohol to the gasoline
      effectively stabilizing the mixture so that the phase separation
      which would normally occur when even trace amounts of water are
      present is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      The stabilizing additive in accordance with the invention, in
      addition to being miscible with both the ethanol and gasoline
      phases is also relatively volatile and boils and evaporates in
      approximately the same range as gasoline, i.e., the stabilizing
      additive has a flash point below about 145 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      The additive in accordance with the invention, as noted above is
      preferably n-hexanol or a mixture thereof with its isomers.
      However it has been found that the efficiency of this stabilizing
      additive can be increased if there is included therein a
      dispersing agent which is itself sufficiently volatile to meet the
      requirements of a combustion engine. Such a dispersant is
      3,5-dimethl-1-hexyn-3-ol.<br>
      <br>
      3.5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol is a clear colorless volatile liquid
      having a boiling point of 150 DEG-151 DEG C. Other surfactants
      similar to the 3,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol can be employed, as for
      instance the Surfynol products (manufactured by Air Products).
      Such products must be unsaturated and must constitute volatile
      surface active agents that eventually evaporate from the system
      containing them, so as to leave no residue to clog the engine or
      otherwise interfere with its functioning.<br>
      <br>
      The quantity of surfactant utilized amounts to 3-7% preferably
      3-5% referred to the stabilizer.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with another aspect of the invention, in order to
      reduce any tendency of the water present in the gasoline-ethanol
      mixture, to bring about corrosion of the steel, it has been found
      expedient to add a volatile amine and more specifically an alcohol
      amine, most preferably a glycol amine which is volatile under the
      conditions of use. One example of a preferred amine for use herein
      is diglycol amine. Another particularly effective amine is n-butyl
      amine. If n-butyl amine is employed, then the effectiveness
      thereof can be further increased by the addition of a small amount
      of 2-pentanone (methylpropylketone). The pentanone serves to
      prevent the separation of n-butyl amine from the hexanol. (This is
      to a great extent due to their overlapping boiling points.) The
      selection of the amine is in part determined by its flash point
      which must be sufficiently high that it does not increase the
      flash point of the gasoline-ethanol-stabilizer-surfactant mixture.
      Preferably a boiling point of about 135-145 DEG F. is to be
      strived for. All of the components of the composition as noted are
      volatile and in use leave no residue in the engine.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention, stabilizing of the mixture of
      gasoline and ethanol containing small amounts of water is achieved
      by the addition of small quantities of the stabilizing additive
      n-hexanol or its mixture with one or more of its isomers per se or
      together with the non-ionic surfactant and/or alcohol amine. The
      additive employed to effect the stabilization may be added to the
      gasoline-ethanol mixture or to the gasoline or the ethanol prior
      to forming the mixture. It is preferred however to add the
      stabilizing additive to the gasoline-ethanol-water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Thus in accordance with the invention it has now been found that
      if about 1-20% of the stabilizing additive is introduced into the
      mixture of gasoline and ethanol containing small amounts of water,
      the mixture exists as a solution or as one phase.<br>
      <br>
      The stabilizer, as pointed out here and above may be added to the
      ethanol or to the gasoline prior to forming the mixture thereof or
      it may be added directly to the gasoline-ethanol mixture. The
      stabilizer is added in amounts on the order of from about 1-20%
      and preferably 3-10% based on the mixture of gasoline and ethanol,
      which amounts have been found to effect a substantially complete
      stabilizing of the gasoline-ethanol mixtures with which the
      invention is concerned. Preferred ranges of the stabilizer to be
      added to the gasoline-ethanol-water mixture range from about 3% to
      about 12%.<br>
      <br>
      The surfactant and the amine are added directly to the stabilizer,
      the surfactant in an amount of 3-7% referred to the stabilizer and
      the amine in approximately like amounts.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant mixture burns clearly without free carbon (soot) and
      ignites easily in combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      Using 194 proof ethanol and gasoline (10:90), separation takes
      place at 30-32 DEG F. If n-hexanol is added in an amount of one
      part per hundred parts of mixture, no separation takes place until
      the temperature has fallen to below -25 DEG F. If the mixture
      includes the surfactant, separation does not take place until the
      temperature has fallen to below -40 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      Using 190 proof ethanol and gasoline (10:90) and 21/2% either of
      hexanol, tertiary butanol or isobutyl alcohol, the anticipated
      separation takes place as follows:<br>
      <br>
      tertiary butyl alcohol: +55 DEG F.<br>
      isobutyl alcohol: +24 DEG F.<br>
      hexanol: -2 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples are set forth for purposes of illustration
      and are not to be construed as limitations of the present
      invention except as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      9 parts of 194 proof ethanol and 90 parts of gasoline (regular
      unleaded) were mixed together. T this mixture there was added 1
      part of a stabilizer having the following composition:<br>
      <br>
      90%: n-hexanol<br>
      7%: surfynol (3,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol)<br>
      3%: diglycol amine<br>
      <br>
      No separation of the mixture took place even when the ambient
      temperature dropped to about -30 DEG F. When 2% of the above
      mixture was added separation did not take place until the
      temperature had reached -65 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      When isobutyl alcohol was substituted for the n-hexanol,
      separation was observed at 25-27 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1.5% of n-hexanol was added to 13.5% 193 proof ethanol and this
      combination added to 85% of gasoline (regular unleaded).<br>
      <br>
      No separation was observed to occur even when the temperature had
      fallen to below -20 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      The addition of the stabilizer, n-hexanol in this case is
      particularly preferred, since the specific gravity of n-hexanol is
      similar to that of the ethanol facilitating the further
      processing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1.5% of a stabilizing additive having the following composition:<br>
      90%: n-hexanol<br>
      8%: n-butylamine<br>
      2%: 2-pentanone<br>
      <br>
      were added to an ethanol-gasoline mixture of the following
      composition:<br>
      13.5%: ethanol (194 proof)<br>
      85%: gasoline (leaded or unleaded)<br>
      <br>
      No separation was observed even when the ambient temperature was
      dropped to below -20 DEG F.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLE 4</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 3 was repeated with identical results using as the
      stabilizer the following composition:<br>
      <br>
      85%: n-hexanol<br>
      12%: n-butylamine<br>
      3%: 2-pentanone<br>
