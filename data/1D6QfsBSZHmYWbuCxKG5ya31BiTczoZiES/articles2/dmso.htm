        <p><b>DMSO</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>No later than 1968, it was discovered that there was another
        product that could target cancer cells, but this product
        actually bound to the chemotherapy. In this article (which will
        be linked to below): </p>
      <p>"Haematoxylon [a dye] Dissolved in Dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO]
        Used in Recurrent Neoplasms [i.e. cancer cells or tumor cells],"
        by E. J. Tucker, M.D., F.A.C.S., and A. Carrizo, M.D. in
        International Surgery, June 1968, Vol 49, No. 6, page 516-527 </p>
      <p>It was shown that DMSO targeted cancer cells!! Is it any wonder
        that the referee of the article stated: </p>
      <p>"In spite of my criticisms, there are some parts of this study
        which do interest me very much. The fact that the Haematoxylon
        [a color die, which allowed the researchers to see which cells
        absorbed the DMSO and haematoxylon] and D.M.S.O. solution had a
        particular affinity for neoplasms [i.e. cancerous cells], and
        did not stain other tissues in animals could be most
        significant." </p>
      <p>In other words, these researchers had discovered something that
        could bind to chemotherapy and then target cancer cells. They
        had found a second "magic bullet"!! </p>
      <p>The combination of DMSO and Haematoxylon was being used as a
        cure for cancer in this study. The combination performed very,
        very well. However, it was unfortunate that chemotherapy was
        used in many of the cases. Since DMSO binds to some types of
        chemotherapy (which was probably not known at the time), it is
        not know whether the success of the treatment was caused by the
        DMSO/chemotherapy combination or the DMSO/haematoxylon
        combination. </p>
      <p>In any case, even though both DMSO and haematoxylon are purely
        non-toxic and purely natural (both come from trees), this is not
        a treatment that should be used at home. It can cause severe
        internal bleeding in some cases. It is far beyond the scope of
        this article to get into the use of this treatment. </p>
      <p>The point is that the "magic bullet" had been found, which this
        website calls "DMSO Potentiation Therapy (DPT)." Obviously,
        further research using DMSO and chemotherapy, or DMSO and
        haematoxylon, never happened. </p>
      <p>Why don't you ask your oncologist why research on the magic
        bullet discovered in 1968 was not followed up on!! You might
        mention the scientific study discussed above. </p>
      <p>In later studies DMSO was found to be a superb potentiator of
        Adriamycin, Cisplatin, 5 Fluorouracil, and Methotrexate, and
        others. For more information about DMSO and chemotherapy see the
        excellent book (which talks about both IPT and DMSO being
        combined with chemotherapy): <br>
        Treating Cancer With Insulin Potentiation Therapy, by Ross A.
        Hauser, M.D. and Marion A. Hauser, M.S. </p>
      <p>Absolutely nothing has been done about these discoveries for
        almost 40 years!! The complete article discussing DMSO and
        Haematoxylon can be found at: <br>
        The Original DMSO and Haematoxylon Journal Article </p>
      <p>You might ask your oncologist why your chances of survival are
        only 3% (ignoring all of their statistical gibberish such as
        "5-year survival rates" and deceptive terms like "remission" and
        "response"), when your chance of survival would be over 90% if
        they used DMSO with very small doses of chemotherapy. </p>
      <p>It would be better for medical doctors to treat cancer patients
        with the right treatment than to have patients treat themselves
        at home. Medical doctors can diagnose better, treat better,
        watch for developing problems better, etc. Unfortunately,
        doctors are using treatments that have been chosen solely on the
        basis of their profitability rather than their effectiveness. </p>
      <p>DMSO is a highly non-toxic, 100% natural product that comes
        from the wood industry. But of course, like IPT, this discovery
        was buried. DMSO, being a natural product, cannot be patented
        and cannot be made profitable because it is produced by the ton
        in the wood industry. The only side-effect of using DMSO in
        humans is body odor (which varies from patient to patient). </p>
      <p>The FDA took note of the effectiveness of DMSO at treating pain
        and made it illegal for medical uses in order to protect the
        profits of the aspirin companies (in those days aspirin was used
        to treat arthritis). Thus, it must be sold today as a "solvent."
        Few people can grasp the concept that government agencies are
        organized for the sole purpose of being the "police force" of
        large, corrupt corporations. </p>
      <p>While it is generally believed that orthodox medicine and
        modern corrupt politicians persecute alternative medicine, this
        is not technically correct. What they do is persecute ANY cure
        for cancer, it doesn't matter whether it is orthodox or
        alternative. The proof of this is IPT and DMSO, which can both
        be combined with chemotherapy. It appears that orthodox medicine
        persecutes alternative medicine only because there are far more
        alternative cancer treatments that can cure cancer than orthodox
        treatments. </p>
      <p>Another substance that targets cancer cells is being researched
        at Purdue University and other places: folic acid. This too will
        be buried unless it can lead to MORE PROFITABLE cancer
        treatments. </p>
      <p>But alternative medicine is not interested in combining DMSO
        with chemotherapy. DMSO will combine with many substances, grab
        them, and drag them into cancer cells. It will also blast
        through the blood-brain barrier like it wasn't even there. </p>
      <p>DMSO has been combined successfully with hydrogen peroxide
        (e.g. see Donsbach), cesium chloride, MSM (though it may not
        bind to MSM), and other products. </p>
      <p>(Note: The issue has come up several times whether it would be
        a good idea to mix DMSO with full-strength chemotherapy. This
        question generally comes up when someone wants to take cesium
        chloride and DMSO with their chemotherapy. The theory would lean
        against such advice, however, in actual practice many patients
        on chemotherapy have also taken DMSO. It does not seem to cause
        a problem, but whether the DMSO binds to the chemotherapy would
        depend on which chemotherapy was being used. DMSO does not bind
        to every type of chemotherapy, only certain kinds (the exact
        kinds are not totally known because the FDA forced all research
        on DMSO to stop). </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>What It Does</b> </p>
      <p>DMSO tends to build up white blood cells and increase immune
        production of MIF (migration inhibitory factors) of macrophages.
        Thus, the immune system is made more effective by allowing
        macrophages to move more quickly. Thus DMSO modulates
        lymphocytes, and it therefore reactivates the production of MIF.
        It also diminishes allergic reactions by unfolding the cell
        membrane and making more cell receptor sites available to
        attachment by specific antigens. </p>
      <p>The modulating effect of DMSO on lymphocytes also tends to
        increase the production of lymphokines (chemical immune cell
        mediators) such as interferon. It potentiates cell mediated
        immunity and can be effective in multiple sclerosis, systemic
        lupus, erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis,
        ulcerative colitis, cancer, etc. </p>
      <p><b>What Are Its Major Therapeutic Properties?</b> </p>
      <p>* It blocks pain by interrupting conduction in the small
        c-fibers, the non-myelinating nerve fibers. <br>
        * It is anti-inflammatory. <br>
        * It is anti bacterial, fungal and viral. <br>
        * It transports all molecules (drugs, etc.) across cell
        membranes. <br>
        * It reduces the incidence of platelet thrombi (clots in
        vessels). <br>
        * It effects cardiac contractility by inhibiting calcium to
        reduce the workload of the heart. <br>
        * It is a vasodilator, probably related to histamine release in
        the cells and to prostaglandin inhibition. <br>
        * It softens collagen. <br>
        * It is a scavenger of the hydroxyl free radical. <br>
        * It stimulates the immune system. <br>
        * It is a potent diuretic. <br>
        * It increases interferon formation. <br>
        * It stimulates wound healing. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>DMSO has certain unique physiological characteristics which
        stem from its molecular makeup: </p>
      <p>* It is a simple small molecule with unusual properties. <br>
        * An exothermic reaction occurs when DMSO is diluted with water
        (heat is generated). <br>
        * Hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are free radicals (oxidants),
        are ubiquitous and highly injurious to cells — and thus health.
        DMSO neutralizes (quenches) these free radicals. It is a free
        radical scavenger! <br>
        * DMSO substitutes for water in the living cell—it can destroy
        intracellular free radicals. No other antioxidant can do that. <br>
        * DMSO increases the permeability of cell membranes yielding a
        flushing effect of toxins from intracellular location to
        extracellular. <br>
        * It is an antidote to allergic reactions. <br>
        * It can penetrate any cell wall; thus it can get where most
        chemicals can’t. <br>
        * It has a very low index of any toxicity. <br>
        * Allergic reactions to DMSO can occur but they are uncommon. <br>
        * DMSO has a myriad of applications in medicine. Some are so
        dramatically effective that the concept of such therapy just
        boggles the mind! </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A wide range of primary pharmacological actions of dimethyl
        sulfoxide (DMSO) has been documented in laboratory studies:
        membrane transport, effects on connective tissue,
        anti-inflammation, nerve blockade (analgesia), bacteriostasis,
        diuresis, enhancements or reduction of the effectiveness of
        other drugs, cholinesterase inhibition, nonspecific enhancement
        of resistance to infection, vasodilation, muscle relaxation,
        antagonism to platelet aggregation, and influence on serum
        cholesterol in emperimental hypercholesterolemia. This substance
        induces differntiation and function of leukemic and other
        malignant cells. DMSO also has prophylactic radioprotective
        properties and cryoprotective actions. It protects against
        ischemic injury. (1986 Academic Press, Inc.) </p>
      <p>The pharmacologic actions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) have
        stimulated much research. The purpose of this report is to
        summarize current concepts in this area. </p>
      <p>When the theorectical basis of DMSO action is described, we can
        list literally dozens of primary pharmacologic actions. This
        relatively brief summary will touch on only a few: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) membrane penetration <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) membrane transport <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) effects on connective tissue <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) anti-inflamation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) nerve blockade (analgesia) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (F) bacteriostasis <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (G) diuresis <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (H) enhancement or reduction of effectiveness
        of other drugs <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I) cholinsterase inhibition <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (J) nonspecific enhancement of resistance of
        infection <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (K) vasodilation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (L) muscle relaxation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (M) enhancement of cell differentiation and
        function <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (N) antagonism to platelet aggregation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (O) influence on serum cholesterol in
        experimental hypercholesterolemia <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (P) radio-protective and cryoprotective

      <p><b>Primary Pharmocological Actions</b> </p>
      <p><b>A. Membrane Penetration</b> </p>
      <p>DMSO readily crosses most tissue membranes of lower animals and
        man. </p>
      <p>Employing [35S] DMSO, Kolb et al,59 evaluated the absorption
        and distribution of DMSO in lower animals and man. Ten minutes
        after the cutaneous application in the rat, radioactivity was
        measured in the blood. In man radioactivity appeared in the
        blood 5 minutes after cutaneous application. One hour after
        application of DMSO to the skin, radioactivity could be detected
        in the bones. </p>
      <p>Denko22 and his associates applied 35S-labeled DMSO to the skin
        of rats. Within 2 hour a wide range of radioactivity was
        distributed in all organs studied. The highest values occurred
        in decreasing order in the following soft tissues; spleen,
        stomach, lung, vitreous humor, thymus, brain, kidney, sclera,
        colon, heart, skeletal muscle, skin, liver, aorta, adrenal, lens
        of eye, and cartilage. </p>
      <p>Rammler and Zaffaroni80 have reviewed the chemical properties
        of DMSO and suggested that the rapid movement of this molecule
        through the skin, a protein barrier, depends on a reversible
        configurational change of the protein occurring when DMSO
        substitutes for water. </p>
      <p><b>B. Membrane Transport</b> </p>
      <p>Nonionized molecules of low molecular wight are transported
        through the skin with DMSO. Substance of high molecular weight
        such as insulin do not pass through the skin to any significant
        extent. Studies in our laboratory have revealed that a 90%
        concentration of DMSO is optimal for the passage of morphine
        sulfate dissoved in DMSO.77 It would have been expected that
        100% would provide better transport than 90%, and the reason for
        an optimal effect at 90% DMSO remains unexplained. It is of
        course well known that 70% alcohol has a higher phenol:water
        partition coefficient than 100% alcohol. </p>
      <p>Elfbaum and Laden27 conducted an in vitro skin penetration
        study employing guinea pig skin as the membrane. They concluded
        that the passage of picrate ion through this membrane in the
        presence of DMSO was a passive diffusion process which adhered
        to Fick's first law of diffusion. It is demonstrated by
        diffusion and isotope studies that the absolute rate constant
        for the penetration of DMSO was approximately 100 times greater
        than that for the picrate ion. Thus, the two substances were
        transferred through the skin independently of each other. The
        exact mechanisms involved in the membrane penetrant action of
        DMSO have yet to be elucidated. </p>
      <p>Studies on membrane penetration and carrier effect have been
        carrier effect have been carried out in agriculture, basic
        biology, animals, and man. In field tests with severely diseased
        fruit, Keil55 demonstrated that oxytetracycline satisfactorily
        controlled bacterial spot in peaches. Control was significantly
        enhanced by adding DMSO to the antibiotic spray. DMSO was
        applied to 0.25 and 0.5% with 66 ppm of oxytetracycline. This
        application gave control of the disease similar to that produced
        alone by 132 ppm of oxytetracycline and suggested the
        possibility of diluting the high-priced antibiotic with
        relatively inexpensive DMSO. There is no good evidence in
        animals that 0.5% DMSO has significant carrier effects. It could
        well be that Keil's results were attributable to a carrier
        effect, but the possibility should always be considered that
        when DMSO is combined with another substance a new compound
        results which can then exert a greater or lesser influence on a
        given process. </p>
      <p>Leonard63 studied different concentrations of several
        water-soluable iron sources applied as foliage sprays to orange
        and grapefruit trees whose leaves showed visible signs of iron
        deficiency. The application of iron in DMSO as a spray was
        followed by a rapid and extensive greening of the leaves, with a
        higher concentration of chlorophyll. </p>
      <p>Amstey and Parkman2 evaluated the influence of DMSO on the
        infectivity of viral nucleic acid, an indication of its
        transmembrane transport. It was found that DMSO enhanced polio
        RNA infectivity in kidney cells from monkeys. Enhancement
        occurred with all DMSO concentrations from 5 to 80% and was
        optimal at 40% DMSO, with a 20-minute absorption period at room
        temperature. A significant percentage of nucleic acid infection
        was absorbed within the first 2 minutes. </p>
      <p>Cochran and his associates14 concluded that concentrations of
        DMSO below 20% did no influence the infectivity of tobacco
        mosaic virus (TMV) or the viral RNA. With concentrations between
        20 and 60% the infectivity of TMV and TMV RNA varied inversely
        with the DMSO concentration. </p>
      <p>Nadel and co-workers72 suggested that DMSO enhanced the
        penetration of the infectious agent in experimental leukemia of
        gunea pigs. Previously Schreck et al.97 had demonstrated that
        DMSO was more toxic in vitro to lymphocytic leukemia than to
        lymphocytes from normal patients. </p>
      <p>Djan and Gunberg24 studied the percutaneous absorption of
        17-estradiol dissolved in DMSO in the immature female rat. These
        steroids were given in aqueous solutions subcutaneously or were
        applied topically in DMSO. Vaginal and uterine weight increases
        resulting from estrogen in DMSO administered topically were
        comparable to results obtained in animals in which the drugs
        were administered in pure form subcutaneously. </p>
      <p>Smith102 reported that a mixture of DMSO and diptheria toxoid
        applied frequently to the backs of rabbits causes a reduction of
        the inflammation produced by the Shick test, indicating that a
        partial immunity of diphtheria has been produced. </p>
      <p>Finney and his associates29 studied the influence of DMSO and
        DMSO-hydrogen peroxide on the pig myocardium after acute
        coronary ligation with subsequent myocardial infaction. The
        addition of DMSO to a hydrogen peroxide perfusion system
        fascilitated the difffusion of oxygen into the ischemic
        myocardium. </p>
      <p>Maddock et al.66 designed experiments to determine the
        usefulness of DMSO as a carrier for antitumor agents. The agents
        were dissoved in 85-100% concentrations of DMSO. One of the
        tumors studied was the L1210 leukemia. Survival time without
        treatment was appoximately 8 days. The standard method of
        employing Cytoxan intraperitoneally produced a survival time of
        15.5 days. When Cytoxan was applied topically in water, the
        survival time was 12.6 days, and topical Cytoxan dissolved in
        DMSO resulted in survival time of 15.3 days. </p>
      <p>Spruance recently studied DMSO as a vehicle for topical
        antiviral agents, concluding that the penetration of acyclovir
        (ACV) through guinea pigs skin in vitro was markedly greater
        with DMSO than when ployethylene glycol (PEG) was the vehicle.
        When 5% ACV in DMSO was compared with 5% ACV in PEG in the
        treatmental herpes infection in the guinea pig, ACV DMSO was
        more effective.103 </p>
      <p>The possibility of altering the blood-brain diffusion barrrier
        with DMSO needs additional exploration. Brink and Stein10
        employed [14C]pemoline dissolved in DMSO and injected
        intraperitoneally into rats. It was found in larger amounts in
        the brain than was a similar dose given in 0.3% tragacanth
        suspension. The authors postulated that DMSO resulted in a
        partial breakdown of the blood-brain diffusion barrier in vitro.
      </p>
      <p>There is conflicting evidence as to whether dimethyl sulfoxide
        can reversibly open the blood-brain barrier and augment brain
        uptake of water-soluable compounds, including anticancer agents.
        To investigate this, 125[-Human serum albumin, horse-radish
        peroxidase, or the anticancer drug melphalan was administered iv
        to rats or mice, either alone or in combination with DMSO. DMSO
        administration did not significantly increase the brain uptake
        of any of the compounds as compared to control uptakes. These
        results do not support prior reports that DMSO increases the
        permeability of water-soluable agents across the blood-brain
        barrier.43 </p>
      <p>Maibach and Feldmann67 studied the percutaneous penetration of
        hydrocortisone and testosterone in DMSO. The authors concluded
        that there was a threefold increase in dermal penetration by
        these steroids when they were dissolved in DMSO. </p>
      <p>Sulzberger and his co-workers107 evaluated the penetration of
        DMSO into human skin employing methylene blue, iodine, and iron
        dyes as visual tracers. Biopsies showed that the stratum corneum
        was completely stained with each tracer applied to the skin
        surface in DMSO. There was little or no staining below this
        layer. The authors concluded that DMSO carried substances
        rapidly and deeply into the horny layer and suggested the
        usefulness of DMSO as a vehicle for therapeutic agents in
        inflammatory dermatoses and superficial skin infections such as
        pyodermas. </p>
      <p>Perliman and Wolfe76 demonstrated that allergens of low
        molecular weight such as penicillin G potassium, mixed in 90%
        DMSO, were readily carried through intact human skin. Allergens
        having molecular weights of 3000 or more dissolved in DMSO did
        not penetrate human skin in these studies. On the other hand,
        Smith and Hegre101 had previously recorded that antibodies to
        bovine serum albumin developed when a mixture of DMSO and bovine
        serum albumin was applied to the skin of rabbits. </p>
      <p>Turco and Canada112 have studied the influence of DMSO on
        lowering electrical skin resistance in man, In combination with
        9% sodium chloride in distilled water, 40% DMSO decreased
        resistance by 100%. It was postulated that DMSO in combination
        with electrolytes reduced the electrical resistance of the skin
        by facilitating the absorption of these electrolytes while it
        was itself being absorbed. </p>
      <p>DMSO in some instances will carry substances such as
        hydrocortisone or hexachlorophene into the deeper layers of the
        stratum corneum, producing a reservoir.104 This reservoir
        remains for 16 days and resists depletion by washing of the skin
        surface with soap, water, or alcohol.105 </p>
      <p><b>C. Effect on Collagen</b> </p>
      <p>Mayer and associates69 compared the effects of DMSO, DMSO with
        cortisone acetate, cortisone acetate alone, and saline solutions
        on the incidence of adhesions following vigorous serosal
        abrasions of the terminal ileum of Wistar rats. Their technique
        had developed adhesions in 100% of control animals in 35 days.
        The treatments were administered daily as postoperative
        intraperitoneal injections for 35 days. The incidence of
        adhesions in different groups was DMSO alone: 20%,
        DMSO-cortisone: 80%, cortisone alone: 100%, saline solution:
        100%. </p>
      <p>It has been observed in serial biopsy specimens taken from the
        skin of patients with scleroderma that there is a dissolution of
        collagen, the elastic fibers remaining intact.93 Gries et al.44
        studied rabbit skin before and after 24 hour in vitro exposure
        to 100% DMSO. After immersion in DMSO the collagen fraction
        extractable with neutral salt solution was significantly
        decreased. The authors recorded that topical DMSO in man exerted
        a significant effect on the pathological deposition of collagen
        in human postirradiation subcutaneous fibrosis but did not
        appear to change the equilibrium of collagen metabolism in
        normal tissue. Urinary hydroxyproline levels are increased in
        scleroderma patients treated with topical DMSO.93 Keloids
        biopsied in man before and after DMSO therapy show histological
        improvement toward normalcy.28 </p>
      <p><b>D. Anti-Inflammation</b> </p>
      <p>Berliner and Ruhmann7 found that DMSO inhibited fibroblastic
        proliferation in vitro. Ashley et al.3 reported that DMSO was
        ineffective in edema following thermal burns of the limbs of
        rabbits. Formanek and Kovak31 showed that topically applied DMSO
        inhibited traumatic edema induced by intrapedal injection of
        autologous blood in the leg of a rat. </p>
      <p>DMSO showed no anti-inflammatory effect when studied in
        experimental effect when studied in experimental inflammation
        induced in the rabbit eye by mustard oil in the rat ear by
        croton oil.79 </p>
      <p>Gorog and Kovacs40 demonstrated that DMSO exerted minimal
        anti-inflammation effects on edema induced by carrageenan. These
        authors also studied the anti-inflammatory potential of DMSO in
        adjuvant-induced polyarthritis of rats. Topical DMSO showed
        potent anti-inflammatory properties in this model. Gorog and
        Kovacs41 have also studied the anti-inflammatory activity of
        topical DMSO, in contact dermatitis, allergic eczema, and
        calcification of the skin of thr rat, using 70% DMSO to treat
        the experimental inflammation. All these reactions were
        significantly inhibited. </p>
      <p>The study of Weissmann et al.114 deserves mention in discussing
        the anti-inflammatory effects of DMSO. Lysosomes can be
        stabilized against a variety of injurious agents by cortisone,
        and the concentration of the agent necessary to stabilize
        lysosomes is reduced 10- to 1000-fold by DMSO. The possibility
        was suggested that DMSO might render steroids more available to
        their targets within tissues (membranes of cells or their
        organelles). </p>
      <p>Suckert106 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects with
        intra-articular DMSO in rabbits following the creation of
        experimental [croton oil] arthritis. </p>
      <p><b>E. Nerve Blockade (Analgesia)</b> </p>
      <p>Immersion of the sciatic nerve in 6% DMSO decreases the
        conduction velocity by 40%. This effect is totally reversed by
        washing the nerve in a buffer for 1 hour.89 Shealy99 studied
        peripheral small fiber after-discharge in the cat.
        Concentrations of 5-10% DMSO eliminated the activity of C fibers
        with 1 minute: activity of the fibers returned after the DMSO
        was washed away. </p>
      <p>DMSO injected subcutaneously in 10% concentration into cats
        produced a total loss of the central pain response. Two
        milliliters of 50% DMSO injected into the cerebrospinal fluid
        led to total anesthesia of the animal for 30 minutes. Complete
        recovery of the animal occurred without apparent ill effect.100
      </p>
      <p>Haigler concluded that DMSO is a drug that produced analgesia
        by acting both locally and systemically. The analgesia appeared
        to be unrelated to that produced by morphine although the two
        appear to be a comparable magnitude. DMSO had a longer duration
        of action than morphine, 6 hr vs 2 hr, respectively.45 </p>
      <p><b>F. Bacteriostasis</b> </p>
      <p>DMSO exerts a marked inhibitory effect on a wide range of
        bacteria and fungi including at least one parasite, at
        concentrations (30-50%) likely to be encountered in
        antimicrobial testing programs in industry.6 </p>
      <p>DMSO at 80% concentration inactivated viruses tested by Chan
        and Gadenbusch. These viruses included four RNA viruses,
        influenza A virus, influenza A-2 virus, Newcastle disease virus,
        Semliki Forest virus, and DNA viruses.12 </p>
      <p>Seibert and co-worker98 studied the highly pleomorphic bacteria
        regularly isolated from human tumors and leukemic blood. DMSO in
        12.5-25% concentration caused complete inhibition of growth in
        vitro of 27 such organisms without affecting the intact blood
        cells. </p>
      <p>Among the intriguing possibilities for the use of DMSO is its
        ability to alter bacterial resistance. Pottz and associates78
        presented evidence that the tubercle bacillus, resistant to
        2000Ýg of treptomycin or isoniazide, became sensitive to 10Ýg of
        either drug after pretreatment with 0.5-5% DMSO. </p>
      <p>Kamiya et al.54 found that 5% DMSO restored and increased the
        sensitivity of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. In
        particular, the sensitivity of all four strains of Pseudomonas
        to colistin was restored when the medium contained 5% DMSO. The
        authors recorded that antibiotics not effective against certain
        bacteria, such as penicillin to E. coli, showed growth
        inhibitory effects when the medium contained DMSO. </p>
      <p>Ghajar and Harmon35 studied the influence of DMSO on the
        permeability of Staphylococcus aureau, demonstrating that DMSO
        increased the oxygen uptake but reduced the rate of glycine
        transport. They could not define the exact mechanism by which
        DMSO produced its bacteriostatic effect. </p>
      <p>Gillchriest and Nelson37 have suggested that bacteriostasis
        from DMSO occurs due to a loss of RNA conformational structure
        required for protein synthesis. </p>
      <p><b>G. Diuresis</b> </p>
      <p>Formanek and Suckert32 studied the diuretic effects of DMSO
        administered topically to rats five times daily in a dosage of
        0.5 ml of 90% DMSO per animal. The urine volume was increased
        10-fold, and with the increase in urine volume, there was an
        increase in sodium and potassium excretion. </p>
      <p><b>H. Enhancement or Reduction of Concomitant Drug Action</b> </p>
      <p>Rosen and associates84 employed aqueous DMSO to alter the LD50
        in rats and mice when oral quaternary ammonium salts were used
        as test compounds. In rats, the toxicity of pentolinium tartrate
        and hexamethonium bitartrate was increased by DMSO, while the
        toxicity of hexamethonium iodide was decreased. </p>
      <p>Male68 has shown that DMSO concentrations of upward to 10% lead
        to a decided increase in the effectiveness of griseofulvin. </p>
      <p>Melville and co-workers70 have studied the potentiating action
        of DMSO on cardioactive glycosides in cats, including the fact
        that DMSO potentiates the action of digitoxin. This effect,
        however, does not appear to involve any change in the rate of
        uptake (influx) or the rate of loss (efflux) of glycosides in
        the heart. </p>
      <p><b>I. Cholinesterase</b> </p>
      <p>Sams et al.90 studied the effects of DMSO on skeletal, smooth,
        and cardiac muscle, employing concentrations of 0.6-6%. DMSO
        strikingly depressed the response of the diaphragm to both
        direct (muscle) and indirect (nerve) electrical stimulation, and
        caused spontaneous skeletal muscle fasciculations. DMSO
        increased the response of the smooth muscle of the stomach to
        both muscle and nerve stimulations. The vagal threshold was
        lowered 50% by 6% DMSO. Cholinesterase inhibition could
        reasonably explain fasciculations of skeletal muscle, increased
        tone of smooth muscle, and the lower vagal threshold observed in
        these experiments. In vitro assays show that 0.8-8% DMSO
        inhibits bovine erythrocyte cholinesterase 16-18%. </p>
      <p><b>J. Nonspecific Enhancement of Resistance</b> </p>
      <p>In a study of antigen-antibody reactions, Reattig81 showed that
        DMSO did not disturb the immune response. In fact, the oral
        administration of DMSO to mice for 10 days prior to an oral
        infection with murine typhus produced a leukocytosis and
        enhanced resistance to the bacterial infection. </p>
      <p><b>K. Vasodilation</b> </p>
      <p>Adamson and his co-workers1 applied DMSO to a 3-1 pedicle flap
        raised on the back of rats. The anticipated slough was decreased
        by 70%. The authors suggested that the primary action of DMSO on
        pedicle flap circulation was to provoke a histamine-like
        reponse. Roth87 has also evaluated the effects of DMSO on
        pedicle flap blood flow and survival, concluding that DMSO does
        indeed increase pedicle flap survival, but postulating that this
        increase takes place by some mechanism other than augmentation
        of perfusion. Kligman56, 57 had previously demonstrated that
        DMSO possesses potent histamine-liberating properties. </p>
      <p>Leon62 has studied the influence of DMSO on experimental
        myocardial necrosis. DMSO therapy effected a distinct
        modification with less myocardial fiber necrosis and reduced
        residual myocardial fibrosis. The author reported that neither
        myocardial rupture nor aneurysm occured in the group treated
        with DMSO. </p>
      <p><b>L. Muscle Relaxation</b> </p>
      <p>DMSO applied topically to the skin of patients produces
        electromyographic evidence of muscle relaxation 1 hour after
        application.8 </p>
      <p><b>M. Antagonism to Platelet Aggregation</b> </p>
      <p>Deutsch23 has presented experimental data showing that 5% DMSO
        lessons the adhesiveness of blood platelets in vitro. Gorog39
        has shown that DMSO is a good antagonist to platelet aggregation
        as well as thrombus formation in vivo. Gorog evaluated this in
        the hamster cheek pouch model. </p>
      <p><b>N. Enhancement of Cell Differentiation and Function</b> </p>
      <p>It has been shown that dimethyl sulfoxide induces
        differentiation and function of leukemic cells of mouse 11, 33,
        46, 65, 92, 115, rat,58 and human.9, 15, 16, 34, 109 DMSO was
        also found to stimulate albumin production in malignantly
        transformed hepatocytes of mouse and rat49 and to affect the
        membrane-associated antigen, enzymes, and glycoproteins in human
        rectal adenocarcinoma cells.111 Hydrocortisone-induced
        keratinization of chick embryo cells74 and adriamcycin-induced
        necrosis of rat skin108 were inhibited by DMSO. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, modification by DMSO of the function of normal
        cells has been reported. DMSO stimulates cyclic AMP accumulation
        and lipolysis and decreases insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation
        in free white fat cells of [the] rat. It also enhances heme
        synthesis in quail embryo yolk sac cells.110 </p>
      <p>Leukemic blasts can be induced by external chemical agents to
        mature to neutrophils, monocytes, or RBCs. The phenotype of
        leukemic cells thus results from both internal genetic
        aberrations and the response of leukemic cells to their external
        environment. When human myeloid leukemia cells are exposed in
        vitro to a variety of agents (e.g.vitamin A or dimenthyl
        sulfoxide) the blasts lose their proliferative potential, the
        expression of oncogene products is sharply decreased, and after
        5 days the leukemic cells become morphologically mature and
        functional neutrophils. Some patients with myeloid leukemias
        have responded to therapy designed to induce maturation in vivo.
        The induced maturation of leukemic cells is a new therapeutic
        tactic-alternative to cytotoxic drug therapy-wherein leukemic
        cells are destroyed by transforming them into neutrophils.86 </p>
      <p>O. Influence on Serum Cholesterol in Experimental
        Hypercholesterolemia </p>
      <p>Rabbits given a high cholesterol diet with 1% DMSO showed
        one-half as much hypercholesterolemia as control animals.48 </p>

      <p>Q. Protection against Ischemic Injury </p>
      <p>De la Torre has advanced a scheme based on both investigated
        and theoretical actions of DMSO on the biochemical events
        generated after an ischemic injury. He previously proposed this
        hypothetical model to help conceptualize how DMSO, or similar
        drugs, mights affect the pathochemical balance that results in
        lack of tissue perfusion following trauma.19 </p>
      <p>The biochemical and vascular responses to injury appear to have
        a cause and effect relationship that can be integrated in terms
        of substances that either increase or decrease blood flow. The
        substance's effect can be physical, i.e. reduce or increase the
        vessel lumen obstruction, or chemical, i.e. reduce or increase
        the vessel lumen diameter (vasoconstriction/vasodilation). </p>
      <p>Platelets, for example, can induce both conditions. Obstruction
        of the vessel lumen can result from platelet adhesion (platelet
        buildup in damaged vessel lining) or platelet aggregation.
        Platelet damage moreover can cause vasoconstriction or vasospasm
        by liberating vasoactive substances locally with the blood
        vessel or perivascularly, if penetrating damage to the vessel
        has occurred. There are two storage sites within platelets that
        contain most of these vasoactive substances. The alpha granules
        contain fibrinogen, while the dense bodies store ATP, ADP,
        serotonin, and calcium, which can be secreted by the platelet
        into the circulation by a canalicular system.5 Thromboxane A2
        has also been shown to be manufactured in the microsomal
        fraction of animal and human platelets.73 All these vasoactive
        substances (with the exception of ATP) can cause significant
        reduction of blood flow by physical or chemical reactivity on
        the vasculature. </p>
      <p>DMSO can antagonize a number of these vasoactive substances
        released by the platelets, which could consequently induce
        vasoconstriction, vasospasm, or obstruction of vessel lumen. For
        example, a study has shown that DMSO can inhibit ADP and
        thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro.95 It may
        presumable do this by increasing the evels of cAMP (a strong
        platelet deaggregator) through inhibition of its degradative
        enzyme, phosphodiesterase.26, 51 DMSO is reported to deaggregate
        platelets in vivo following experimental cerebral ischemia.26,
        51 This effect may be fundamental in view of the finding that
        cerebral ischemia produces transient platelet abnormalities that
        may promote microvascular aggregation formation and extend the
        area of ischemic injury.25 </p>
      <p>The biochemical picture is further complicated by the possible
        activity of DMSO on other vasoactive substances secreted by the
        platelets during injury or ischemia. For example, the release of
        calcium from cells from cells or platelets and its effect on
        arteriolar-wall muscle spasm may be antagonized by circulating
        DMSO.13, 88 Collagen-induced platelet release may also be
        blocked by DMSO.44, 94 </p>
      <p>The following effects of DMSO are likely to be involved in its
        ability to protect against ischemic injury. </p>
      <p><b>DMSO and PGTX System</b> </p>
      <p>Little is known about the actions of DMSO on the prostanoids
        (PG/TX). Studies have reported that DMSO can increase the
        synthesis of PGE1, a moderate vasodilator.61. PGE1 can reduce
        platelet aggregation by increasing cAMP levels and also inhibit
        the calcium-induced release of noradrenalin in nerve terminals,
        an affect that may antagonize vasoconstriction and reduction of
        cerebral blood flow.53 </p>
      <p>DMSO, it will be recalled, also has a direct effect on cAMP. It
        increases cAMP presumably by inhibiting phosphodiesterase,113
        although an indirect action on PGI2-induced elevation of
        platelet cAMP by DMSO should not be ruled out. Any process that
        increases platelet cAMP will exert strong platelet
        deaggregation. </p>
      <p>It has also been reported that DMSO can block PFG2 receptors
        and reduce PFE2 synthesis.82 Both these compounds can cause
        moderate platelet aggregation and PFG2 is known to induce
        vasoconstriction.60 The effects of DMSO on thromboxane synthesis
        are unknown. It could, however, inhibit TXA2, biosynthesis in
        much the same way as hydralazine or dipyridamole42 since it
        shares a number of similar properties with these agents:
        specifically, their increase of cAMP levels. </p>
      <p><b>DMSO and Cell Membrane Protection</b> </p>
      <p>The ability of DMSO to protect cell membrane integrity in
        various injury models is well documented.38, 64, 91, 114 </p>
      <p>Cell membrane preservation by DMSO might help explain its
        ability to improve cerebral and spinal cord blood flow after
        injury.18 DMSO could be preventing impairment of cerebrovascular
        endothelial surfaces where PGI2 is elaborated and where
        platelets can accumulate following injury. The effects of DMSO
        may be two-fold: reduction of platelet adhesion by collagen,44
        and reduction of platelet adhesion by protecting the vascular
        endothelium and ensuring PGI2 release. </p>
      <p><b>DMSO, Hydroxyl Radicals, and Calcium</b> </p>
      <p>Although many hormones, chemical transmitters, peptides, and
        numerous enzymes can be found in mammalian circulation at any
        given time, it is the hydrozyl radicals that have drawn
        attention by playing an important role in the pathogenesis of
        ischemia.21, 30 Free radicals can be elaborated by peroxidation
        of cellular membrane-bound lipids where oxygen delivery is not
        totally abolished, as in ischemia and hypoxia, or when oxygen is
        resupplied after an ischemic episode.83 </p>
      <p>One of the significant sites where hydroxyl radicals can form
        following ischemia is in mitochondria. DMSO is known to be an
        effective hydroxyl radical scavenger.4, 20, 75 Since it has been
        shown that DMSO can improve mitochondrial oxidative
        phosphorylation, it has been suggested that DMSO may act to
        neutralize the cytotoxic effects of hydroxyl radicals in
        mitochondria themselves.96 Oxidative phosphorylation is one of
        the primary biochemical activities to be negatively affected
        following ischemic injury. DMSO has also been reported to reduce
        ATPase activity in submitochondrial particles,17, 36 an effect
        that can lower oxygen utilization during cellular ischemia. </p>
      <p>It has been proposed that DMSO may reduce the utilization of
        oxygen by an inhibiting effect on mitochondrial function. In one
        experiment the energy loss due to inhibition of oxidative
        activity after brain tissue was perfused with DMSO was
        compensated for by an increase in glycolysis.36 </p>
      <p>It seems probable that the neutralizing action of DMSO on
        hydroxyl radical damage following injury could diminish the
        negative outcome of ischemia. However the formation of hydroxyl
        radicals is dependent on time and oxygen availability, but the
        development of ischemia is immediate and its reversal may depend
        on more prevalent subsystems such as the PG/TX and platelet
        interactions. Maintaining the balance of these subsystems
        appears more critical in predisposing the outcome of cerebral
        ischemia. </p>
      <p>Another interesting effect of DMSO is on calcium. When isolated
        rat hearts are perfused with calcium-free solution followed by
        reperfusion with a calcium-containing solution, a massive
        release of creatine kinase (indicating cardiac injury) is
        observed. This creatine kinase level increase is accompanied by
        electrocardiographic (EKG) changes and ultrastructural cell
        damage.50 DMSO has been reported to significantly reduce the
        release of creatine kinase and prevent EKG and ultrastructural
        changes if it is present during reperfusion of the isolated rat
        heart with a calcium-containing solution.88 Moreover,
        examination of the heart tissue by electron microscopy showed
        that DMSO-treated preparations lacked the mitochondrial swelling
        and contraction band formation otherwise induced by the reentry
        of calcium.88 These findings are supported by another
        investigation showing that DMSO can block calcium-induced
        degeneration of isolated myocardial cells.13 This protective
        effect by DMSO on myocardial tissue may be critical during
        ischemic myocardial infarction when evolutionary EKG changes,
        serum creates kinase levels are elevated, and myocardial
        necrosis can develop rapidly. </p>
      <p>DMSO2 is not an effective cryoprotective agent; however,
        Herschler47 has recorded that DMSO (dimethyl sulfone) is a
        natural source of biotransformable sulfur in plants and lower
        animals. Jacob and Herschler have reported a number of unique
        properties possessed by DMSO.52 Since DMSO is oxidized to DMSO2
        in vivo, scientists should include DMSO as a control in basic
        biologic studies on DMSO in plants and animals. </p>

      <p>... The 30 patients included in this study were regular
        patients in our clinic and were evaluated three times in order
        to see if it was possible to use the HLB test as a measuring
        method of FR, as well as DMSO as an optimum antioxidant. The
        results obtained are represented in Figure 1, where we find an
        initial average FR measuring 30.6% of the patients included,
        with an important and significant decrease of FR production
        after DMSO administration, obtaining lower levels with an
        average of 10.6%. That represents a 66% decrease in patients
        before beginning the DMSO therapy, and keeping the patients in
        monthly applications we obtained an average of 13.3% of FR
        synthesis. That represents 52% decrease than the patients had in
        the beginning, and 12% higher than patients after any DMSO
        infusion. </p>
      <p>It is important to verify that the higher values were obtained
        in patients with RA, and the lowest in patients with OA. </p>

      <p>The subject of DMSO therapy has its own web page on this site.
        I want to focus here on its use in cancer therapy. DMSO has many
        characteristics which make it a good adjunctive treatment for
        cancer. Recall from our previous discussion that DMSO is a
        super-solvent. It binds to water (which makes up around 65% of
        the body) better than water does. This gives DMSO the ability to
        penetrate every single cell of the body, so whatever its other
        effects may be, they will be spread systemically through the
        entire body. Whatever is administered with DMSO tends to bind
        with the DMSO and is carried to the inside of cells along with
        DMSO. </p>
      <p>Animal studies show that DMSO, by itself, inhibits the growth
        of breast, colon and bladder cancer, as well as leukemia, in
        animals. The fact that this list is not longer probably reflects
        the fact that DMSO has not been studied in other cancers. </p>
      <p>If cytotoxic drugs are given to fight a cancer, they are more
        effective when given with DMSO to escort them to the inside of
        cancer cells. DMSO also relieves the pain of cancer and, by
        being a free radical scavenger, reduces the side effects of
        radiation therapy. </p>
      <p>But, it's the old story! As with most effective and affordable
        cancer therapies, it is not approved for that use by the FDA.
        This, despite the presence of more than 6,000 articles attesting
        to its safety and effectiveness and despite the fact that almost
        every civilized country approves of DMSO treatment for cancer
        except, you guessed it, the USA. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, some doctors do offer DMSO in the US. Because
        DMSO is approved for one rare bladder condition called
        "interstitial cystitis," it is possible for doctors to use it
        for any other purpose. The FDA's authority extends to the
        determination of whether or not an item is safe, and it is up to
        the doctor to determine its correct use. While the FDA specifies
        approval only for treatment of interstitial cystitis this
        specification has no teeth. </p>
