      I began a replication of Arata in early 2009 under sponsorship of
      EPRI. I completed that work with a report dated August 2012. It
      was a collaborative effort among 6-8 LENR experts.<br>
      <br>
      We found excess energy in 14 consecutive experiments, but the
      power output was only on the order of 100-200 milliwatts. This
      result was real, but it was dwarfed by Rossi's claims. At that
      time Rossi had failed in over ten consecutive experiments to
      demonstrate his claims.<br>
      <br>
      The Lugano effort was the Mount Everest of bad Science. I and
      others demanded that the Lugano test not use optical pyrometry.
      Levi and his noble band did us one better by refusing to use
      thermocouples to corroborate their own data.<br>
      <br>
      I had abandoned all hope of the Rossi claims when Parkhomov
      announced his replication of Lugano. I dropped everything and
      began my own replication since I had all the equipment set up from
      the EPRI experience.<br>
      <br>
      I found no excess energy in 7 consecutive experiments. Then I
      learned that Parkhomov had trouble replicating his own claims.
      This followed with a Chinese claim, but that too was withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of my EPRI study I discussed adding high voltage pulses
      through the nanopowders to enhance energy output. I burned out the
      power supply and I was introduced to Arthur Manelas (Pelham NH) to
      fix the supply as he was an expert on high voltage pulsed power.
      He showed me a device that seemingly violated the First Law of
      Thermodynamics. He had an electric car powering itself with a
      supply based on Tesla and Floyd Sweet.<br>
      <br>
      I and two other talented engineers set out to make independent
      measurements of the performance. We found a large ferrite billet
      (1" x 4" x 6") weighing one kilogram. The billet was highly
      insulating. It was also ferromagnetic with unusual field
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      The billet was wound around each of its 3 axises with about 150
      feet of magnet wire. High voltage pulses were sent in through two
      windings and power was extracted from the third winding to charge
      the battery pack of the car. We found an excess electrical power
      out put of 60 watts for the 6 days of the test. During this period
      the billet ran 5 degrees C below ambient.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first report of any transformer showing a Negative
      Hysterisis. This has caused us to believe that LENR has magnetism
      at it core.<br>
      <br>
      Arthur Manelas took the device apart to rebuild two new ones.In
      the interim he suffered a stroke and died without leaving a
      circuit diagram or notes on the operation. I remain baffled by the
      operation in 2011-2012 period and believe that the excess comes
      from a new magnetic interaction.<br>

      Brian Ahern, Vibronic Energy Technologies Corp "Nanomagnetism for
      Energy Production" March 22, 2014 CF/LANR Colloquium at MIT <br>
      <br>
      Comment -- ROGER JOHNSON -- During the 2014 CF/LANR colloquium at
      MIT Dr. Ahern mentioned that there seemed to be a correlation
      between northern lights and the voltage fluctuations in the
      Manelas circuit.&nbsp; I compared the Manelas data with the
      fluctuations in earth's magnetic field at Fredericksburg, VA and
      Saint John's NFLD (intermagnet.org).&nbsp; While the field was
      active during the first test as expected when northern lights are
      visible this far south&nbsp; I can not see anything that suggests
      a connection between the field and the voltage drops.&nbsp; I also
      do not see any connection between the two phenomena in the second
      set of data.&nbsp; I suspect that the ACE and GOES satellite
      data&nbsp; also will show no correlation with the voltage
      fluctuations, but I have not checked them.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ahern also mentioned that the ferrite was cooler than the
      ambient temperature, and also exhibited negative hysteresis.&nbsp;
      Although the photo does not appear to have been taken in Pelham,
      NH I compared the Manelas data with weather data from Pelham, NH,
      where I think Mr. Manelas used to live.&nbsp;
      (weatherunderground.com).&nbsp; The voltage dips occurred during
      periods of low temperature and high humidity in the first
      test.&nbsp; There seems to be no connection between temperature
      and the voltage anomalies in the second test, however the initial
      positive voltage anomaly may have occurred because the ferrite was
      warmer when the system was started.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;I believe that the device Mr. Manelas has developed is in
      fact a magnetic refrigeration unit that extracts&nbsp; heat in the
      form of electrical energy.&nbsp; It behaves differently when
      cold/humid.&nbsp; I would like to record the temperature of the
      ferrite with a thermal imaging camera while monitoring the output
      to see if the voltage anomalies are connected to the ferrite
      temperature, and to see if the ferrite temperature is
      uniform.&nbsp; If there is a connection between temperature and
      output then adding a fan to warm the ferrite, and/or adding holes
      to the ferrite to improve heat transfer should increase output.<br>
