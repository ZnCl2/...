      When we think of EVs (electric vehicles) we usually think of super
      lightweight tiny one or two passenger cars like we see on the
      homepage of this forum. In reality however, a somewhat new but
      suppressed battery technology can change how we think in a hurry.
      Below is an article from Energy Consultant B.D. McBride that will
      make you think twice about many things. Although he starts out
      talking about the Fukishima tragedy, he changes gears to reveal
      things the U.S. government does not want us to know - about green
      energy and solutions that have been available to us for years, but
      have been hidden from us. Anyway, this may make your blood boil so
      prepare yourself...<br>
      <br>
      "After the Fukishima fiasco many nuclear scientists were quietly
      asking each other why we continue to use dangerous and obsolete
      nuclear reactors fueled by uranium when they can be retrofitted to
      use safer, cheaper, and more powerful Thorium, the only green
      nuclear fuel which is virtually impossible to have a meltdown or
      other catastrophic failure. After all, Thorium is not only more
      abundant, much cheaper to acquire and process, but also yields a
      20 to 1 energy yield advantage over uranium. Better still, Thorium
      cannot be used to make nuclear weaponry so every country on Earth
      (even Iran and other nations hostile towards the West) could enjoy
      a nuclear energy option. According to the EPA and CDC, common coal
      dust is three times more dangerous to people than Thorium. And
      Thorium nuclear waste is one tenth the volume of uranium nuclear
      waste. Frankly I cannot find a downside to Thorium. China, Norway,
      and India have already made the switch to Thorium, but in the West
      the technology is being conveniently ignored. Why?<br>
      <br>
      Worst still is what has been happening in the nuclear battery
      development arena. In 1996-1998, Dr. Shimoda (Osaka University of
      Technology), Dr. Khanna (Harvard), Dr. Eugene Mallove (MIT) and
      Dr. Aries M. DeGeus introduced the world to the realities of MHD
      physics and plasma powered energy - the same energy we see in
      lightning bolts during a thunderstorm. They put forth solid
      theories that even the U.S. DoE embraced and subsequently
      sponsored over $40 million of research that resulted in the
      publication of 5 white papers that were once posted on the
      internet between 1997-2008, but which all then mysteriously
      vanished in 2010 without explanation.<br>
      <br>
      Further, at least three, and possibly as many as five inventors
      including Russian Dimitri Petronov, and Americans Aries DeGeus,
      Dr. Mallove, and "Daniel" produced working prototypes of a Thorium
      plasma battery that was demonstrated to dozens of people, and
      unfortunately both the American, and Russian militaries. With zero
      emissions, these batteries were scalable and could put out
      consistent voltage with less than .0002 fluctuation, and could be
      regulated with an AC/DC converter. They could theoretically put
      out reliable energy without fission for their entire half-life. In
      the case of the Thorium 232 isotope, the battery could operate for
      over a hundred years. The three known prototypes powered an
      electric scooter, a two bedroom home, and a small four passenger
      car for over a year without a single recharge. Then word got out.<br>
      <br>
      Since then, two of these inventors were murdered and two others
      disappeared and nobody knows what happened to the prototypes. Then
      the Pentagon invoked “National Security” and issued a gag order to
      the only surviving inventor who has since gone underground.
      Information at the DoE about Thorium and other nuclear batteries
      vanished just like related details at over a dozen other links
      like these were also removed:<br>

      Valuable technology which can eliminate coal plants, global
      warming, and wean the world off fossil fuels is being suppressed
      by the western governments and their oil industry/national defense
      puppet masters my friends. Use of a Thorium plasma battery in 50
      million American cars would eliminate over $850 million USD every
      single day in fuel tax revenues at the state and federal levels in
      America. That income represents about 40% of America's operating
      capital.<br>
      <br>
      Now since these batteries are scalable, imagine the one the size
      of about 500 square meters is plugged into a power grid and
      supplies clean, green electricity to a city of 2 million
      residents. Even more government revenues are denied. But the
      technology suppression is not only based on economics, but
      apparently national security according to this link:<br>

      If plasma battery technology is good enough for the U.S. Navy and
      NASA, it should be good enough for every citizen whose taxes pay
      for both of those government agencies to operate! If the batteries
      are good enough to power an electric tank, they should be good
      enough to power every family's car. This suppression reminds me of
      the old Canadian Avro jet fighter plane the U.S. Defense
      Department demanded be destroyed in the 1950s. Clearly these
      batteries are certainly not in the best interests of the $600
      Billion oil industry.<br>

      How much do you think it costs to bribe,.... er,.... sorry,
      "lobby" every member of the House and Senate? My wife who is an
      accomplished lawyer and former U.S. Assistant Attorney, thinks
      this technology suppression is a classic textbook case of
      "racketeering" and "organized crime". She directed my attention to

            Disruptive Oil Giant Killer Technology</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      At the risk of being black-balled and ostracized by my government
      and peers, I feel compelled to speak out as a plasma physicist.
      Since 1959 the scientific community has known that Thorium was a
      better, safer, and more economical option to power nuclear
      reactors, yet they pursued uranium – why?<br>
      <br>
      Simply put – because Thorium cannot be used to make nuclear bombs
      or power nuclear submarines – the two driving forces that gave
      birth to America’s nuclear program. Why is Thorium superior? For
      Five reasons as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. Thorium is more stable and contains 20% more energy density
      than Uranium, thus yielding more energy per ton and dollar.<br>
      <br>
      2. It is impossible for Thorium reactors to have a catastrophic
      meltdown like we saw with Uranium in Chernobyl. Therefore there is
      no lethal risk to the community or world.<br>
      <br>
      3. Thorium is more readily available in abundance while Uranium
      deposits will be fully depleted within the next 10 years, and
      almost 80% of Thorium deposits are found in the U.S. not in
      unstable countries.<br>
      <br>
      4. Thorium does not pose the disposal nightmare that we
      experienced with uranium over the last 3 decades.<br>
      <br>
      5. Since Thorium is not suitable for atomic weapons, we need not
      worry about emerging nations who really want and need and nuclear
      energy while we fear a secret nuclear weapons program.<br>
      <br>
      So with all these benefits, why are we still using dangeous
      uranium that makes every nuclear reactor a ticking time bomb? In
      simple terms – the military industrial complex, big oil, and all
      the politicians whose campaigns were funded and supported by both.<br>
      <br>
      In 2004, Thorium plasma batteries made their debut as compact
      portable devices that could provide reliable power for 3-7 years,
      non-stop, without a recharge. Three inventors came up with 3
      different but similar designs and all three worked flawlessly –
      providing a green alternate energy source with no adverse safety
      or environmental concerns.<br>
      <br>
      Since these stand-alone batteries can be manufactured in various
      sizes consider the following applications:<br>
      <br>
      * Laptop and other PCs<br>
      * Electric bicycles &amp; scooters<br>
      * Automobiles<br>
      * Trucks<br>
      * Ships &amp; Barges<br>
      <br>
      But think BIG and one of these plasma batteries the size of a
      shoebox could power a complete 5 bedroom house and every appliance
      in it. Or one the size of Hummer could power a complete 300 unit
      condominium complex without any external power grid connection.
      But think even bigger still… A battery the size of that same 5
      bedroom house could power the City of Dayton – by plugging it into
      the local power grid. And there would be zero emissions. Thorium
      plasma power can eliminate every coal plant in the world in less
      than 5 years. But it gets better still…<br>
      <br>
      If we were to drive electric cars and trucks powered by plasma
      battery technology, we could reduce global warming by 30% within
      five years and perhaps 50% within a decade. But what is good for
      mankind and our grandchildren poses a huge threat of financial
      loss to others – primarily big oil and politicians. Here is why…<br>
      <br>
      While two-faced politicians talk about greening the world every
      four years just before they face elections, they are being wined
      and dined by big oil (Remember the Cheney-Enron affair?) to
      complicitly keep us addicted to oil. Why?<br>
      <br>
      Because roughly 43% of all revenues paid for gasoline and other
      fuels are collected by the government in taxes, and these taxes
      provide more than a third of the nation’s operating budget.
      Adopting green Thorium plasma battery technology would reduce
      national oil consumption by more than 85% and how would our pols
      get by with 33% less tax revenues. Once gotten, graft is no sot
      easy to surrender as one Senator told me last year – “It would be
      easier to quit smoking after 10 years of chain smoking!”<br>
      <br>
      So in essence, short term greed obfuscates even the chance of any
      long term vision or concern for our grandchildren. But if we found
      a way to use Thorium to make some horrific weapons of mass
      destruction that could kill millions if people in some foreign
      oil-rich land 5,000 miles away, Congress would be throwing
      billions into its development. In reality, those who are supposed
      to be serving “We the people” are simply serving themselves and
      the oil giants for as long as they can possibly profit.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, my recent information is that the U.S. and Russian
      militaries are already using these nifty batteries in their most
      sacred and secret programs (i.e. unmanned underwater missile
      launchers, spy drones, super long-range torpedoes, etc). So while
      Uncle Sam ignores our critical and immediate public need for green
      energy and clean air, they are preparing for some future war that
      could be years away, even though we now have enough weapons in our
      arsenal to destroy every major city in the Eastern hemisphere
      within 10 hours!<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, there are over 100 nuclear plants fueled by dangerous
      uranium vulnerable to natural disasters, terrorist attack, or
      targeted in the event of our next war. Each and every time a
      nuclear accident takes place, we all become potential victims left
      only at the mercy of the blowing winds. Our fates our left to
      luck.<br>
      <br>
      Japan’s nuclear fiasco is perhaps the final alarm Mother Nature
      will sound for us. Those of you with the interest and intelligence
      to sort fact from fiction need to start doing a little homework
      about Thorium plasma battery technologies and put the screws to
      your local pols, and compel them to put commitments in writing
      before they get your vote. As you may know by now, their ears only
      listen to us citizens every four years. Afterwards, they let money
      do all the talking – at our expense and risk.<br>

      ...Danny is not allowed to tell us very much. In fact, according
      to the court order he was served by the Pentagon's legal
      department,&nbsp; he is not even allowed to tell us his real name
      or anything about the incredible plasma battery that took him
      almost 12 years to develop. This green energy device (which we
      learned on our own), operates on radiated isotopes and magnets,
      puts out a steady and constant charge of AC or DC current for 5 to
      7 years, and is very compact. So much so, that one the size of a
      pack of cigarettes can power a television set or electric scooter,
      and one the size of a shoebox can, and did power a small car with
      an electric motor non-stop for 13 months - before Uncle Sam came
      along and confiscated all of it - in the name of national
      security.&nbsp; Government agents not only seized his prototype,
      but all of his notes, drawings, and even his computer's hard
      drive! To add insult to injury even his patents were ordered to be
      sealed.&nbsp; As I talked to Dan on the phone for almost twenty
      minutes, I could hear the angst and frustration in his voice.<br>
      <br>
      You see Danny once worked as an Air Force reservist - one of those
      "weekend warriors" to pay his way through graduate school. So now
      our beloved government says that Dan who did some work for the
      design team of the now famous "Predator" remotely-piloted
      surveillance aircraft, forfeited his rights to ownership of any
      patents since he "probably used knowledge acquired during his time
      in the Air Force Reserves".&nbsp; So instead of helping the world
      put a final end to coal plants with his cool battery (they can be
      made as large as a house to power a city of 1 million people), the
      device is destined for covert military use.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed this is one amazing battery my friends. One the size of a
      refrigerator could power a 300 room hospital or condo building
      with no connection to the power grid for several years - all
      without any noise or emissions. They can even be used to power
      electric super high speed bullet trains without running miles of
      power lines.<br>
      <br>
      What became of Dan's battery? It was pirated by the DoD and turned
      over to Sandia National Laboratories where we learned several
      prototypes were made and delivered to NASA , U.S. Navy,&nbsp; U.S.
      Army, and U.S. Air Force for "field testing" about&nbsp; 18 months
      ago. What kind of tests, we can only guess.&nbsp; But after
      speaking with a long-time friend and graduate of M.I.T. who works
      as a consultant to Raytheon, his guesses are probably more
      realistic and accurate than mine:<br>
      <br>
      1. A long range torpedo for submarines that could travel for many
      miles to find and destroy its target, since current torpedo ranges
      are limited only by the duration of their power source.<br>
      <br>
      2. Perhaps a silent tank or armored vehicle powered by an electric
      motor and a plasma battery that would allow it to traverse and
      entire continent without ever having to refuel.<br>
      <br>
      3. How about a power source for a satellite or a high altitude
      surveillance drone - also powered by an electric motor or turbofan
      and a plasma battery.&nbsp; Such an combination would enable the
      aircraft to remain aloft for days or even weeks!<br>
      <br>
      But with Global Warming threatening our world, this plasma battery
      could easily end our addiction to oil and power our automobiles
      and eliminate 27% of our global emmissions. It could provide
      reliable power for many remote rural communities and third world
      countries. It could be used extensively in disaster-relief
      operations following hurricanes like Andrew and Katrina with on
      site power generation without the need for fossil fuels to run
      noisy generators.<br>
      <br>
      Is it fair for the Pentagon to take priority over all new
      technology - especially one that would benefit our environment so
      dramatically?&nbsp; We tried to ask them, but of course they had
      "no comment".&nbsp; It is a sad day in America when our best and
      brightest inventors are muzzled and their incredible gadgets
      reserved only for some future war that may or may not take place.
      Humanitarian needs and benefits need to trump military planning in
      my humble opinion.&nbsp; If you agree with me, send a copy of this
      article and say so in a letter to your Congressman and Senator.<br>
      <br>
      Today Danny has yet another great green energy idea smoldering in
      his brain, but he doesn't dare spend yet another $150,000 and 12
      years of his life to develop it, only to have it stolen away by
      the government. Now his biggest fear is being arrested since he
      was read the National Security Act warning when served his gag
      order.&nbsp; Before I hung up the phone with Danny, he told me in
      a sad voice of surrender,,, "They didn't even say thank you."<br>

      <i>High Speed Bullet Trains could be self-powered with Thorium
        Plasma Batteries – Eliminating route restrictions and need for
        external electric power lines.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      China and Japan are leading the world in development of high speed
      bullet train routes, but thus far routes have been limited to
      major metropolitan corridors supported and tethered to local power
      grids. But new battery technologies would allow a transnational
      route or even a transcontinental route that would require no
      external power source. The development of the Thorium plasma
      battery, a nuclear battery created independently by both U.S. and
      Russian inventor could power the trains for 5-10 years without a
      single recharge, and without posing any safety or health hazards.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, a Thorium plasma battery the size of a small refrigerator
      would be sufficient to power today’s trains with a reliable
      self-contained power source. Unfortunately, both the American and
      Russian militaries have seized ownership of the technology from
      their inventors and promptly confiscated and classified all notes,
      drawing, and patents related to the device, ostensibly “to protect
      national security interests”. See these links:<br>
      <br>
      The very same batteries could be used to power cell phones,
      laptops, electric scooters, electric vehicles, and even entire
      homes, as was demonstrated by the Russian inventor DiMitri
      Petronov in 2009. Both the CDC and EPA have reported that Thorium,
      the only safe green nuclear fuel that can actually be safely
      handled by humans with no chance of a catastrophic failure, is
      actually 30 times safer than common coal. Although India, China,
      and Norway are now using Thorium to power their nuclear reactors,
      the Thorium plasma battery does not utilize fission, but rather
      the principles of fusion of radiated isotopes. Only five
      scientists in the world have confirmed knowledge of the new
      battery, and allegedly Panasonic is poised to be the first to
      introduce the technology in a cell phone that will never need to
      be recharged.<br>
      <br>
      But for now, only the U.S. Navy and Air Force get to use these
      super high-tech batteries for long range torpedoes and
      anti-satellite weaponry. Sadly, this same technology if made
      available for commercial applications could reduce green house
      gases by 30%-50% and ultimately replace every coal plant in the
      world since the batteries could be made in large 1-10 megawatt
      sizes that could be plugged into local power grids to power entire
      cities.<br>
      <br>
      So for now at least, public transportation, global warming, and
      clean green energy is forced to take a back seat to weaponry that
      may never even be used. This questionable rank of priorities by
      the American and Russian governments makes one wonder if the
      United Nations is totally devoid of any leadership, ethics, and
      courage to compel public access to such useful technology.<br>
      <br>
      Finally found with google search:<br>
      <br>
      "Not again with the same thorium hoax, exposed as such repeatedly
      elsewhere... Again, it's been talked about since the 1950s, so do
      your own research before you start laughing. Start with Scientific
      American, especially the comments by readers...<br>
      <br>
      But yes, thorium and unicorns and pixie dust will make all the
      technical struggles that have persisted since 60 years ago
      magically disappear. Have I missed all the interim Thorium-powered
      concept cars at the last 20 years of auto shows, too?"<br>
      <br>
      No wonder the hoaxers can't post at TES! <br>

      I received this from an MIT alumni of mine and since I personally
      met Gene Mallove, I have to take this quite seriously. I hope you
      do too.<br>
      <br>
      In 1998 an American named Stanley Meyer, (probably Ohio’s most
      famous inventor) was poisoned and died clutching his throat
      outside a restaurant in his hometown of Grove City just moments
      after he jumped up from the table and shouted “They’ve poisoned me
      – I am going to die!” Stan had invented and demonstrated many
      times for the media and hundreds of people, his now-famous dune
      buggy with an internal combustion engine that ran only on water.
      Stan had found a practical and cheap way to produce hydrogen on
      demand. He was offered millions by Arab investors
      (well-documented) and declined their offers. The Pentagon had
      officials meet with Meyer and there were agreements made to fund a
      research and production facility. Within two months however, Stan
      was dead at age 45.<br>
      <br>
      Eugene Mallove another alternate energy inventor found a way to
      use the principles of cold fusion to replace oil as our primary
      fuel and he was found beaten to death in 2005. In 2007 A.M. DeGeus
      another American inventor who is one of two American scientists
      who pioneered the plasma battery was found slumped over in his car
      parked at an Airport in North Carolina before boarding a plane for
      Europe where he was expected to ink a multi-million dollar funding
      deal that would put his invention, another oil replacement on the
      market. In 2010, Russian Dimitri Petronov, who also produced a
      plasma battery the size of a shoebox that powered his entire two
      bedroom house and all the appliances in it for over a year without
      a single recharge, vanished after being seen enjoying coffee and
      pastry in Moscow’s Red Staren Coffee Shop. His disappearance took
      place only a few weeks after giving elaborate demonstrations of
      his 3 year battery to top Generals at a Russian military base. Yet
      another American inventor, who we only know now as “Danny” had
      invented a similar plasma battery that went even longer than
      Petronov’s, was hustled away by FBI agents after returning from a
      visit to China where he met with investors and planned to
      demonstrate his battery. Although he was confirmed to be alive in
      January of 2011, he no longer resides in his California home and
      he won’t even tell his own sister where he is living! &nbsp;<br>

      </b>So why are these energy inventors disappearing or suffering
      sudden and unusual deaths? Well friends, just stop and consider
      who makes money from oil and how much money these people make… The
      petroleum industry is a $600 Billion ANNUAL industry in which less
      than 2,000 of the world’s most influential people receive 85% of
      this revenue stream, including the Bush and Cheney families, along
      with 73 other American, Saudi, British, and Kuwaiti blue-blood
      families just like them. Further, State, Provincial, and Federal
      governments in 32 countries derive over 30% of their operating
      budgets from gasoline and other fuel taxes. Typically 40 cents of
      every dollar spent on gas, oil, or diesel fuel goes into
      government accounts. Now imagine, that a new technology comes
      along that will eliminate this income stream, or at the very
      least, reduce it by more than half. Those who stand to lose
      billions of dollars will not think twice about snuffing out the
      life of an inventor or entrepreneur when the cost of a
      professional hit man is only $100,000 these days, with amateurs
      charging only half this amount. Certainly billionaires who own and
      control 85% of the world’s wealth are not going to let a few
      innovative scientists threaten to stop their gravy train.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how deceptive or well-covered up the murders may be, it
      is clear to most in academic and energy circles that very evil
      conspirators have monitors in the scientific community and
      patrolling the internet for new “threats”. If the new technologies
      cannot be discredited or outright purchased (only to be locked in
      a closet), the key people either disappear, suffer some bizarre
      accident, or become targeted for some phony criminal charges that
      keeps investors away from funding the technology involved.<br>
      <br>
      Those that merely think I am some “conspiracy nut” are in fact
      ignorant of reality and need to some homework. For starters they
      (perhaps even you?) need to stop getting their “news” from the
      mainstream media that is owned and operated by the same circle of
      blue-bloods and read the postings at
      http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm , wikileaks,
      www.informationclearinghouse.com, and democraticunderground.com.
      Or grab a few enlightening books like “Immaculate Deception” by
      General Russell Bowen or “The Defrauding of America” by Rodney
      Stitch. Only after you tune into the truth will your realize the
      general public is just being milked for more and more money by the
      wealthy, who keep everyone either oblivious, or diverted by one
      fabricated crisis after another. Americans have truly lost their
      collective backbone and become complacent sheeple. I believe it
      was Ayn Rand who said, “Every people get the government they truly
      deserve”. Start reading America or you will continue to be used
      and abused!<br>
