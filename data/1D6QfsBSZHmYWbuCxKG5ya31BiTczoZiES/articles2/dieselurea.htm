        <p><b><font size="+1">Urea tanks on diesel trucks -- that's the
              law in the United States starting in 2010</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Automotive grade of world's most widely used nitrogen
        fertilizer used to meet new US environmental regulations to cut
        air pollution </p>
      <p>Urea tanks will be standard equipment for most new diesel
        trucks, buses, cars, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs)
        manufactured in the United States after Jan. 1, 2010. An
        automotive grade of urea will be injected into the vehicles'
        exhaust stream to "scrub" nitrogen oxide (NOx) from the diesel
        exhaust. </p>
      <p>NOx, a major air pollutant, contributes to smog, which causes
        asthma and respiratory and heart diseases. </p>
      <p>The system, urea SCR or "urea-based selective catalytic
        reduction," is the only technology available that can remove
        enough NOx from diesel exhaust to comply with strict new limits
        imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), says
        Glenn Kedzie, Environmental Counsel for the American Trucking
        Associations. </p>
      <p>The automotive urea, called "diesel exhaust fluid" (DEF) in the
        United States and AdBlue, a trademarked name in Europe, reduces
        NOx by as much as 90% alone, and can take NOx to near-zero
        levels when used in combination with diesel particulate filter
        technology, says Kim Doran, spokesperson of the newly formed
        North American SCR Stakeholders Group and editor of
        FactsAboutSCR.com, a Web site dedicated to SCR news. </p>
      <p>DEF and AdBlue are an aqueous urea solution 32 (AUS 32), a
        clear 32.5% nitrogen solution of high-purity urea in
        demineralized water. The urea solutions are safe to handle,
        manufacturers claim. AdBlue can be bought in bulk in Europe or
        by the liter at some service stations. </p>
      <p>The advent of DEF and AdBlue is creating a new demand for urea,
        the world's most widely used nitrogen fertilizer. Some are
        concerned that the new use will drive fertilizer prices higher.
        Others think it will be an incentive for manufacturers to
        increase production and thus, lower prices. </p>
      <p>"We know about diversion of traditional food crops such as corn
        or sugarcane to biofuels like ethanol — but now urea, a basic
        input for food production, is also going into fuel," says Dr.
        Amit Roy, President and CEO of the International Center for Soil
        Fertility and Agricultural Development (IFDC). </p>
      <p>"Ironically, cleaning our environment is a key reason for both
        technologies." </p>
      <p><b>Manufacturers Adopting Urea SCR Technology</b> </p>
      <p>More than half a million diesel trucks in Europe now use urea
        SCR and the fleet is growing by about 25,000 trucks per month,
        according to Integer Research, a London-based market analysis
        firm specializing in urea SCR. </p>
      <p>Doran says that SCR technology is being adopted by passenger
        car and light truck manufacturers serving the United States
        including Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Jeep, Kia, MiniCooper, and
        Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz is introducing three new
        diesel-powered SUVs that use urea SCR technology into the United
        States in late 2008. Urea SCR is also used in Japan and
        Singapore and will soon be used in China. </p>
      <p>Manufacturers in the commercial trucking industry adopting SCR
        include Freightliner, Kenworth, Mack, Peterbilt, and Volvo.
        Leading engine manufacturers using SCR include Cummins and
        Detroit Diesel Corp. </p>
      <p><b>Future Demand</b> </p>
      <p>Consumption of the urea solution is about 3% of the diesel
        consumption. Diesel trucks average 6.5 miles per gallon (2.8
        km/liter). An average diesel truck will need to refill its
        20-gallon tank of DEF every 4,000 to 6,000 miles (76 liters
        every 6,400 to 9,600 km). </p>
      <p>Urea to reduce NOx emissions now consumes 0.3 to 0.4 million
        metric tons (mt) of urea in Western Europe, says Stephen Zwart,
        Licensing Manager of Netherlands-based Stamicarbon, the world's
        largest licensor of urea plant technology. In 10 years the
        current truck fleet in Western Europe will have been replaced,
        and urea use will be 3 to 4 million mt. </p>
      <p>Future urea demands generated by SCR technology in the United
        States have been calculated by Dr. Carlos Baanante, IFDC
        Agricultural Economist. </p>
      <p>In 2003, 213 billion liters of diesel fuel were used for
        transportation in Europe and 146 billion liters in the United
        States, according to EarthTrends, an initiative of the World
        Resources Institute (http://earthtrends.wri.org/index.php). </p>
      <p>Baanante assumes that only 7% of the diesel trucks in the
        United States will use urea SCR in 2010 — the new trucks
        purchased that year. </p>
      <p>"U.S. urea consumption for transportation will probably be the
        urea fertilizer equivalent of about 210,000 tons in 2010 — but
        will be at least double that amount in 2011 and will increase
        rapidly afterward as older trucks are replaced with newer models
        that carry urea tanks," Baanante says. </p>
      <p>The estimates assume that a liter of the solution weighs about
        1 kg and the urea fertilizer contains 46% N, Baanante explains.
        Thus, 1 kg of urea solution would consume the N needed to
        produce 0.7065 kg of urea fertilizer. A conversion factor of
        0.7065 is used to calculate urea solution consumption in terms
        of mt of urea-fertilizer equivalent. </p>
      <p>"More than 90% of the world's urea production is for
        fertilizers — but new demands for urea SCR may change that,"
        Baanante says. Urea is also used in animal feed, plastic and
        glue manufacture, highway de-icing, cloud seeding to induce
        rain, and tooth-whitening products. </p>
      <p><b>Stringent New EPA Exhaust Emission Rules</b> </p>
      <p>Kedzie says that diesel-powered vehicles manufactured in the
        United States in 2010 can emit no more than 0.2 grams of NOx per
        brake horsepower hour — 90% less than current emissions. The new
        EPA regulations will not apply to vehicles manufactured before
        2010. </p>
      <p>Tractors, bulldozers, and other non-road vehicles must meet the
        new EPA standards by 2015. The U.S. timetable for ships and
        locomotive engines has not yet been set. </p>
      <p>"Some trucking agencies are now buying new trucks that were
        scheduled for replacement after 2010 to avoid the expenses of
        urea tanks and buying and transporting urea," Kedzie says. </p>
      <p>But Thom Albrecht, a transportation equity analyst with
        Stephens Inc. in Virginia, United States, thinks that most
        corporate carriers — the main buyers of heavy-duty trucks — will
        continue normal buying cycles as the next EPA emissions deadline
        looms in 2010. Albrecht reached that conclusion after surveying
        88 carriers about their future buying plans. </p>
      <p><b>New Demands Could Affect World Fertilizer Market</b> </p>
      <p>Keith Stokes, proprietor of Stokes Engineering and IFDC
        consultant on urea production, says, "Urea for NOx reduction
        will create a new demand that could drive up fertilizer
        prices—just as ethanol production did." </p>
      <p>But Doran of SCR Stakeholders says, "Demand for this
        automotive-grade urea is not expected to exceed 5% of the
        world's production. The new use of urea to control vehicle
        emissions could lead to increased investment and expand world
        capacity for urea production." </p>
      <p><b>How Urea SCR Systems Work</b> </p>
      <p>Urea SCR cleans the exhaust after combustion. The urea solution
        is held in a separate storage tank and injected as a fine mist
        into the hot exhaust gases. The heat breaks the urea down into
        ammonia—the actual NOx-reducing agent. Through a catalytic
        converter, the ammonia breaks the NOx down to harmless nitrogen
        (N) gas and water vapor. The exhaust is no longer a pollutant;
        the atmosphere is about 80% nitrogen gas. </p>
      <p>Bill Herz, Vice President of Scientific Programs for The
        Fertilizer Institute, based in Washington, D.C., says, "You hear
        a lot about harmful effects of fertilizer on ecosystems—but
        little about the positive role of urea in stripping away
        pollutants." </p>
      <p>Doran says, "Because SCR technologies reduce NOx exhaust to
        almost zero, engines can be tuned to maximize fuel efficiency."
        The result is as much as a 3%??% fuel savings and reduced carbon
        dioxide emissions. </p>
      <p>"The exhaust coming from the tailpipe of an SCR-equipped
        vehicle may actually be cleaner than the air around it," Doran
        adds. </p>
      <p>In fact, according to Daimler Trucks, the engine efficiency
        achieved by using SCR technology in Europe has saved customers
        more than 280 million liters of diesel and nearly half a billion
        dollars in fuel spending. At the same time, the environment was
        spared about 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p><b>A Trucker's Concerns</b> </p>
      <p>"We're concerned because we don't know enough about the new
        urea technology," says Adam Collum, Manager and Co-Owner of
        Hellums Trucking Co. in Dennis, Mississippi, United States. </p>
      <p>"A new heavy-duty diesel truck now costs about $100,000. Adding
        the urea SCR system will add $10,000 to the cost. How much more
        will the urea solution that we burn cost? What about
        maintenance? Will the urea cause corrosion?" </p>
      <p>Doran says, "Urea can be corrosive to aluminum. Vehicle SCR
        systems and DEF dispensers have been designed to accommodate
        this and DEF is always stored in appropriate containers." </p>
      <p><b>BlueTec Technology in Europe</b> </p>
      <p>The new diesel SUVs coming from Daimler in Europe to the United
        States are called BlueTec models because they are equipped with
        BlueTec SCR injection systems—a technology that Mercedes-Benz
        has used in trucks and buses in Europe for years. For these
        models, the urea will come in cartridges that will be replaced
        during normal servicing. </p>
      <p>Detroit Diesel Corp., a brand of Daimler Trucks North America,
        has announced that it will use BlueTec technology on all future
        trucks. </p>
      <p>The Mercedes-Benz E320 BlueTec won the 2007 World Green Car of
        the Year Award partly for "paving the way for super-clean diesel
        technology around the world." The BlueTec diesel emissions
        control technology was declared the best new technology for 2007
        by the Automotive Journalist Association of Canada. </p>
      <p><b>Planning for the Future</b> </p>
      <p>The North American SCR Stakeholders Group met to further plan
        the development of a distribution and retail infrastructure to
        ensure DEF availability in the United States in August in
        Dearborn, Michigan. Stakeholders include representatives of
        almost 200 organizations including diesel vehicle manufacturers,
        current and potential DEF producers, fuel and equipment
        distributors and retailers, as well as the U.S. EPA and
        Department of Energy, according to an Aug. 11 SCR Stakeholders
        news release. </p>
      <p>Part of the work of the SCR Stakeholders Group involves
        development of a Web site locator for DEF similar to that used
        for AdBlue in Europe. </p>
      <p>In Europe, AdBlue prices have almost doubled since mid-2007 and
        producers are finding it difficult to absorb cost increases for
        urea, Today's Trucking reported on July 18, 2008, citing Integer
        Research. "Add the fact that producers are getting better
        returns on urea when it is sold as fertilizer, and no wonder
        that prices have driven up," the report stated. </p>
      <p><b>DEF Manufacturers</b> </p>
      <p>Traditional fertilizer manufacturers will probably produce most
        DEF urea used in the United States. Producers in the SCR
        Stakeholders Group include Agrium, Brenntag North America, Dyno
        Nobel, Koch Industries, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, and
        Terra Industries. </p>
      <p>Stephen Zwart of Stamicarbon says, "In Europe, manufacture of
        AdBlue has been a boon to many fertilizer manufacturers who now
        allocate part of their production to urea solution for the
        trucking industry." </p>
      <p><b>Logistics of DEF</b> </p>
      <p>Keith Stokes says that delivering urea to gas stations should
        not be a problem. "Although the United States has more than
        30,000 gas stations, only 2,200 of them supply 97% of the
        heavy-duty vehicle market. </p>
      <p>"But urea storage tanks in some regions will need heating coils
        to keep the solution above its 12° F [-11° C] freezing point." </p>
      <p>Pilot Travel Centers, the largest retail operator of travel
        centers in the United States, announced rollout plans to make
        DEF available "at the pump" at more than 100 centers in mid to
        late 2009 in a Sept. 29 news release. The Pilot Centers will
        also carry prepackaged DEF. </p>
      <p><b>Aqueous Urea Production</b> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mitsubishi is increasing production of high-grade
        aqueous urea solution for urea SCR systems, according to
        GreenCarCongress.com. The company's plant at Kitakyushu, Japan,
        has been running at about 20% capacity—about 2 million liters
        per year. As SCR demand increases, plans are to increase
        production to 10 million liters in 2008 and reach 50% capacity
        in 2009. </p>
      <p>Japan's demand for high-grade aqueous urea is about 20,000
        kiloliters per year, but industry sources expect it to increase
        to about 600,000 kiloliters in the future. </p>
      <p><b>Need for Higher Production and More Efficient Use of Urea</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The new demands for urea to treat diesel exhausts will make
        research to improve the efficiency of its use as a fertilizer
        even more important," says Ramon Lazo de la Vega, IFDC Senior
        Engineering Specialist. "IFDC works in three main areas to
        increase the efficiency of urea use: through deep placement of
        urea briquettes, especially in irrigated rice fields; through
        controlled-release fertilizers; and through nitrification and
        urease inhibitors that decrease nitrogen losses to the air
        through volatization and to groundwater through leaching. </p>
      <p>"New urea plants are also being built. For example, two large
        urea plants are opening in Iran and one each in Egypt, Nigeria,
        Oman, and Russia." </p>
      <p>IFDC's Amit Roy says, "Most basic fertilizer products used
        today—including major improvements of farm-use urea — were
        developed by the fertilizer program of the U.S.-based Tennessee
        Valley Authority (TVA) in the 1950s to 1970s when energy seemed
        cheap. With current manufacturing technology, the energy
        equivalent of four barrels of oil is used to convert 'free'
        atmospheric nitrogen to 1 ton of urea. </p>
      <p>"The new demands emphasize the need for research to develop a
        new range of more energy-efficient technology — not only for
        food but now for use with fuel," Roy says. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">EPA Issues Guidance on Urea SCR for Diesel
              Emissions Control</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The EPA has issued guidance on emission certification
        procedures for on-road diesels that use selective catalyst
        reduction (SCR) technology for NOx reduction. This guidance
        enables automakers, for the first time, to adapt the technology
        to light- and heavy-duty vehicles in the US. </p>
      <p>The specific area of concern is the use of a reducing agent
        (e.g., AdBlue) injected into the exhaust gas upstream of the
        catalyst.&nbsp; Without the reducing agent, the efficiency of
        the SCR catalyst drops to zero and NOx emissions can increase
        substantially. Many automakers, however, are looking to such
        urea SCR solutions as the near-term solution for meeting Tier 2
        Bin 5 emissions regulations for diesels. </p>
      <p>The guidance letter is not a ruling — it does not establish a
        final certification process, but rather reflects the agency’s
        current thinking and direction. </p>
      <p>The letter focuses on specific regulatory requirements that can
        impact the certification and implementation of SCR for
        light-duty and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and heavy-duty diesel
        engines: Allowable Maintenance and Adjustable Parameters. </p>
      <p>Allowable maintenance. Under existing regulations,
        emission-related maintenance can not occur before 100,000 miles
        of use (150,000 miles for medium- and heavy-duty engines) or
        before 100,000 mile intervals thereafter. Because the SCR
        catalyst in a urea SCR system does not function without the use
        of a reducing agent, EPA believes that the 100,000-mile interval
        applies to the SCR catalyst and all of the associated hardware,
        including but not limited to, the reducing agent, the reducing
        agent storage tank, the dosing valve, and all lines and hoses. </p>
      <p>The problem with that from the OEM’s point of view is their
        inability to equip vehicles with storage tanks of sufficient
        size to allow for that 100,000-mile interval. The regulatory fix
        to this is for OEMs to request a change to the scheduled
        maintenance interval, based on the technological necessity of a
        new maintenance interval. EPA opened the door for that with the
        guidance letter, and suggested that “It may be appropriate for
        EPA to approve an industry-wide scheduled maintenance change, as
        we have done previously in similar situations.” </p>
      <p>Adjustable parameters. Emissions certification testing is done
        across a range of parameters that can be (a) physically adjusted
        and (b) affect the emissions outcome. EPA is considering an SCR
        system that requires a reducing agent to meet the definition of
        an adjustable parameter—i.e., without the reducing agent, the
        NOx control fails. </p>
      <p>This means that we have the authority to test an SCR-equipped
        vehicle with varying levels of reducing agent in the storage
        tank, or, theoretically, without any reducing agent at all. If
        the vehicle is capable of meeting the NOx standard without any
        reducing agent, we would not consider the SCR system to be in
        violation of the standard. However, if the vehicle exceeds
        emissions standards without reducing agent in the tank, we
        expect that we would deny the certification because the design
        will be considered unacceptable. If the manufacturer can prove
        to EPA that their SCR system design will not run out of reducing
        agent in-use and thus not exceed the emission standards, we may
        determine that the design is acceptable and approve
        certification of the vehicle design. </p>
      <p>EPA then divides its acceptance criteria for urea SCR systems
        into two categories: vehicle compliance and reducing agent
        availability and accessibility. </p>
      <p>Vehicle compliance. There are five different categories for
        vehicle compliance, and manufacturers must satisfy all five: </p>
      <p>1. Driver warning system <br>
        2. Driver inducement <br>
        3. Identification of incorrect reducing agent <br>
        4. Tamper resistant design <br>
        5. Durable design </p>
      <p>Reducing agent availability. EPA will review each
        manufacturer’s plan for reducing agent availability and
        accessibility, with particular emphasis on the following
        procedures: </p>
      <p>1. Reducing Agent Available at Dealerships <br>
        2. Reducing Agent Available at Truckstops <br>
        3. Back-Up Plan </p>
      <p>The EPA also wants to see public eduction plans from each
        manufacturer. The agency also calls for the establishment of an
        industry-wide reducing agent quality standard and
        specifications. SCR systems will need to be designed to operate
        using the general range of commercially available reducing
        agents. The agency also notes the importance of having a clear
        and unambiguous industry-wide identifier, regardless of any
