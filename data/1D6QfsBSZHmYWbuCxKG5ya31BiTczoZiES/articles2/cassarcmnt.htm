      Italcementi, which spent 10 years developing its TX Active, said
      the building material is capable of reducing urban pollution by
      more than 40 percent, the Italian news agency ANSA reported
      Tuesday. <br>
      <br>
      Tests on a road near Milan showed TX Active cut the level of
      nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide by as much as 65 percent. <br>
      It functions via a chemical process called photocatalysis, whereby
      sunlight triggers a chemical reaction when titanium dioxide on the
      surface of the cement comes into contact with pollutants in the
      air. TX Active works most effectively in bright sunlight. <br>
      Italcementi said test results have been verified by independent
      bodies like the National Research Council. <br>
      <br>
      TX Active cement has already been used on a number of buildings,
      including Air France's new headquarters at Paris' Charles de
      Gaulle Airport, Rome's Dives in Misericordia church and Bordeaux's
      Hotel de Police.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Visitors to the Venice Biennale
        can check out the smog-eating cement that Italian inventors
        claim will help cities clean themselves</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Venice hardly counts among the most-polluted places in the world.
      There are no cars traveling its narrow streets, and all traffic is
      either by foot or by boat. So despite the crowded walkways and
      canals, the air in Venice is far cleaner than that of, say, Milan,
      Italy's economic capital, which recent figures indicate has some
      of the worst air quality in Europe.<br>
      <br>
      Even so, visitors to the Italian Pavilion of the architecture
      exhibition in the Venice Biennale, which will remain open until
      Nov. 19, will get a breath of fresh air. That's because parts of
      the concrete walls and grounds have been built with cement
      containing an active agent that, in presence of light, breaks air
      pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, benzene, and
      others through a natural chemical process called photocatalysis.<br>
      <br>
      The demonstration is a reminder that smart innovation applies also
      to mundane products and can offer unexpected solutions even for
      complex problems such as air pollution. The technology, called TX
      Active, has been under development for almost 10 years in the labs
      of Italcementi, the world's fifth-biggest cement producer, and is
      starting to be applied commercially to buildings and streets in
      Italy, France, Belgium, and elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Painting the Town</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The results so far are astonishing: A street in the town of
      Segrate, near Milan, with an average traffic of 1,000 cars per
      hour, has been repaved with the compound, "and we have measured a
      reduction in nitric oxides of around 60%," says Italcementi's
      spokesperson Alberto Ghisalberti. In a test over an 8,000 square
      meter (or approximately 2 acres) industrial area paved with active
      blocks near Bergamo, Italcementi's hometown, the reduction was
      measured at 45%.<br>
      <br>
      In large cities such as Milan, with persistent pollution problems
      caused by car emissions, smoke from heating systems, and
      industrial activities, both the company and outside experts
      estimate that covering 15% of all visible urban surfaces (painting
      the walls, repaving the roads) with products containing TX Active
      could abate pollution by up to 50%, depending on the specific
      atmospheric conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this approach isn't meant to replace efforts to curb
      pollution, but it can significantly magnify their effects. Here's
      how it works: The active principle—basically a blend of titanium
      dioxide that acts as photocatalyzer — can be incorporated in
      cement, mortar, paints, and plaster.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        The Big Bite</span><br>
      <br>
      In the presence of natural or artificial light (this applies also
      indoors) the photocatalyzer significantly speeds up the natural
      oxidation processes that cause the decomposition of pollutants,
      transforming them into less harmful compounds such as water,
      nitrates, or carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      "These aren't necessarily 'clean', but from an environmental
      standpoint they're much more tolerable," says Rossano Amadelli of
      the Italian National Research Council (CNR), the scientists who
      led the laboratory testing of the TX Active materials.<br>
      <br>
      The patented pollution-reduction technology — which in Italy is
      becoming known as "cemento mangiasmog" or "smog-eating cement" —
      comes at a premium, of course, but the extra cost is limited by
      the fact that the active principle only needs to be used on the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeping It Clean</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "To transform the facade of a five-story building into a
      photocatalytic surface would add only 100 or so euros ($120) to
      the cost of a traditional paint or plaster," Ghisalberti
      estimates. Paving a street or a sidewalk is a different story, but
      still not extreme: Photocatalytic blocks cost about one-third more
      than usual paving, which is still far less than the long-term cost
      of doing nothing about air pollution.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that the photocatalyzing cement has another
      advantage, one that has great appeal to star architects such as
      Richard Meier. TX Active not only hastens the decomposition of
      organic and inorganic pollutants, it also prevents their build-up
      on surfaces, helping to preserve a building's pristine appearance
      over time.<br>
      <br>
      The spectacular design of Meier's Dives in Misericordia Church in
      Rome, includes three concrete self-bearing white sails, topping
      out at 26 meters. One of Meier's material requirements was that
      the whiteness of the sails be durable. That has been achieved
      through the application of the active principle, which basically
      "self-cleans" the surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The same system has been applied to the new Air France
      headquarters inside the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, a
      place with high concentrations of hydrocarbons and where, needless
      to say, a standard white facade would not remain white for long.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention refers to the use of colloidal
      photocatalytic preparations of titanium, dioxide (TiO.sub.2) for
      maintaining the original appearance of cementitious, stone, or
      marble products.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The conservation of architectural assets depends to a considerable
      extent on the environment in which they are located. The problem
      of the preservation of such assets assumes important dimensions if
      it is considered that the action of atmospheric agents has become
      increasingly aggressive over time.<br>
      <br>
      The conservation of architectural structures, buildings and
      artefacts subject to outdoor exposure has to do with forces that
      act in an important way on the surface is of the constructions or
      in the layers immediately below the surface and that regard the
      depositing of organic and inorganic materials which usually adhere
      to the aforesaid organic substrate, and the action of acid rain.<br>
      <br>
      One of the main problems of architectural cementitious, stone, or
      marble products therefore regards the constant maintenance over
      time of their original appearance, which is undermined by the
      natural process of ageing due to the influence of atmospheric
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      The need is therefore particularly felt for economical systems of
      intervention which enable conservation of the aesthetic
      characteristics of the surface of constructions made of
      cementitious, stone, or marble material.<br>
      <br>
      With the aim of protecting such artefacts, various techniques are
      resorted to, the most common of which consist in applying
      water-repellent products, such as silicone solutions that are
      stable in alkaline environments and are stable to light and
      weather. Unfortunately, the progressive increase in the pollutants
      present in a typical metropolitan environment, perhaps also on
      account of their frequently acidic nature, has markedly limited
      the duration of this type of protection, with consequent aesthetic
      degradation of the artefact.<br>
      <br>
      In order to overcome this new problem, various solutions have been
      proposed. For example, the patent IT 1286492 (in the name of the
      present applicant) illustrates a hydraulic binder for cementitious
      compositions which comprises in its mass a titanium-dioxide based
      photocatalyst that is able to oxidize, and hence neutralize, the
      polluting substances present in the environment. This type of
      solution is certainly valid as regards the protection of the
      surface of the artefact from any possible deterioration caused,
      for example, by wind abrasion, but clearly it implies the use of
      enormous amounts of photocatalyst as compared to those actually
      needed. In fact, the photocatalyst is present not only on the
      surface of the artefact or in the immediately underlying layers,
      i.e., in the areas where its presence proves useful, but in the
      entire cementitious mass, which, for the most part, will never
      come into contact with external agents.<br>
      <br>
      Alternative solutions have also been proposed (see, for example,
      the European patent, application No. EP 0 885 857 in the name of
      the present applicant) which regard cementitious levelling
      plasters containing various polymeric additives and photocatalysts
      that are able to oxidize the polluting substances present in the
      environment, but these cementitious-based formulations are white,
      and cannot be used, for instance, on marble or stone materials
      without consequently modifying their aesthetic characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      The use of anatase, which is one of the tetragonal crystalline
      forms of titanium dioxide, as photocatalyst for the oxidation of
      organic pollutants has been known for some time, also in the form
      of colloidal preparations.<br>
      <br>
      The patent EP 784034 (in the name of Matsushita Electric Works)
      describes substrates obtained by depositing titanium dioxide on
      the surface of a substrate by deposition of a solution containing
      ammonium titanium fluoride, followed by calcining. The patent EP
      614682 (in the name of Fuji Electric) illustrates a titanium-based
      or titanium/activated carbon-based photocatalyst fixed on a
      fluororesin to obtain sheets or panels to be applied externally on
      buildings for removing low concentrations of NO.sub.x.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporation of metal ions (doping agents) in these
      preparations alters the photocatalytic activity of titanium
      dioxide to a substantial extent. The most important parameters are
      the type of ion, the concentration of the dopants, and the thermal
      treatment useful for the formation of the photocatalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Brezova V. et al., J. Photochem. Photobiol. A: Chem., 109, (1997),
      177-183, analyze the influence of various metal ions and their
      concentrations in a particular application of titanium dioxide as
      photocatalyst, namely, in the oxidation of phenol. In particular,
      preparations of colloidal titanium dioxide are described, in which
      the titanium dioxide is doped with various metals at 5% atom/atom,
      following a procedure whereby colloidal titanium dioxide is first
      prepared, and next the salt of the doping metal is mixed under
      heating. Among the various metal ions tested, cerium is reported
      to reduce the photocatalytic activity of the colloidal titanium
      dioxide. In the publication, as in other previous publications on
      this subject, no mention is made of the use of the said
      photocatalytic products on cementitious materials.<br>
      <br>
      The patent EP 633964 (in the name of Fujisawa, Hashimoto, and
      Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha) describes a TiO.sub.2 based photocatalyst
      preferably doped with V, Fe, Cu. Co, Ni, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd. Ag, Pt,
      or Au, and fixed on a fluorinated polymer for adhesion to the
      substrate. This photocatalyst is useful for purifying air, but
      also water, from various undesired substances.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It has' now been surprisingly found that colourless colloidal
      preparations of titanium dioxide, or of one of its precursors,
      possibly doped with elements chosen from groups I-VA, and the
      lanthanide and actinide series of the periodic table, or mixtures
      thereof, preferably magnesium, cerium, niobium or lanthanium, wh n
      applied on the surface of cementitious, stone, or marble products,
      are able to preserve the original appearance of the surface,
      without altering the characteristics of the cementitious, stone,
      or marble material.<br>
      <br>
      The solution devised thus regards a system for treating
      cementitious, stone, or marble surfaces by using titanium
      dioxide-based colourless colloidal suspensions, the titanium
      dioxide being possibly doped with elements chosen from groups
      I-VA, and the lanthanide and actinide series of the periodic
      table.<br>

      and marble products, by means of application of said preparations
      on the given surface.<br>
      <br>
      The colloidal preparations of titanium dioxide or one of its
      precursors useful for the purposes of the present invention may
      contain a metal ion chosen from groups I-VA, and the lanthanide or
      actinide series of the periodic table, and preferably comprising
      lithium, beryllium, magnesium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanium,
      cerium, niobium, vanadium, zirconium, and mixtures thereof. More
      preferably, the colloidal preparations of titanium dioxide or one
      of its precursors according to the present invention are doped
      with ions selected from the group consisting of magnesium, cerium,
      niobium, and lanthanium.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of doping agent, i.e., of metal ion present in the
      preparations useful for the purposes of the present invention,
      ranges from 0.1 to 5% (percentage expressed as metal-ion atoms
      with respect to the atoms of titanium), preferably from 0.1 to 1%.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the titanium dioxide present in the preparations
      according to the invention is prevalently in the form of anatase;
      i.e., the particles of photocatalyst have an anatase structure at
      least for 75%.<br>
      <br>
      As precursor of titanium dioxide useful for the purposes of the
      present invention is meant any product that is able to produce
      titanium dioxide prevalently in the form of anatase, possibly with
      appropriate types of thermal treatment. For example, TiCl.sub.4,
      TiOSO.sub.4, titanium alkoxide (for instance, titanium
      isopropoxide) can be effectively used as precursors for the
      purposes of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      By polluting substances that are oxidized by the photocatalysts of
      the present invention are meant the organic substances that may be
      present in the environment as a result of motor-vehicle exhaust or
      industrial emissions, such as benzene, aromatic volatile
      compounds, pesticides, phenols, and benzofluorides, without
      excluding inorganic compounds, such as nitrogen oxides (NO.sub.x)
      which can be oxidized to yield nitrates.<br>
      <br>
      By cementitious artefact is meant any product in the hardened
      state deriving from a cementitious composition or cementitious
      mixture, by cementitious composition or cementitious mixture being
      meant any composition in which the binder is mixed with water and
      possibly with aggregates of various grain size. The cementitious
      compositions thus include both cementitious pastes, i.e., pastes
      consisting of binder and water (devoid of aggregates), and
      conglomerates, i.e., mixtures of water, cement and aggregates.<br>
      <br>
      The aggregates or inert substances may be coarse aggregates, such
      as crushed stones or gravel, or fine aggregates, such as sand, and
      are classified according to UNI 8520 Standards. Examples of
      conglomerates are mortars (mixtures of binder, water, and fine
      aggregate) and concretes (mixtures of water, binder, fine
      aggregate, and coarse aggregate). Among the cementitious products
      preferred according to the present invention are cited the
      so-called "architectural concretes", i.e., in situ castings with
      non-treated surfaces (plane or shaped) or treated surfaces (for
      example, sanded).<br>
      <br>
      By marble or stone products are meant the marbles proper, i.e.
      crystallized metamorphic limestones, "calcetiri", cipollinos,
      limestone, dolomites, polishable limestone breccias, onyx marbles,
      serpentines, and ophicalcites; granites proper, i.e., intrusive
      magmatic rocks consisting of quartz, sodium and potassium
      feldspars, and micas, other intrusive magmatic rocks (diorites,
      gabbros, etc.), and the corresponding porphyritic-structured
      effusive magmatic rocks, metamorphic rocks, such as "gnelsa" and
      "serizi"; travertine and the so-called commercial stone, such as
      sandstone, tuff, quartzites, mica schists, slates, basalts, etc.
      Titanium dioxide in colloidal form is prepared using sol-gel
      techniques so as to have particles of a size of between 10 and 200
      .ANG., preferably between 50 and 100 .ANG..<br>
      <br>
      In contrast with what is reported in the prior art, hydrolysis of
      the titanium dioxide takes: place directly in the presence of the
      salt of the doping element by co-precipitation or mixing. In fact
      the preparation of two distinct colloidal suspensions, one
      containing the titanium dioxide and the other the salt of the
      doping metal, which are subsequently mixed together, is described
      in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      The colloidal suspension is then treated so as to obtain a
      colloidal film over the material that is to be preserved, a
      necessary step for assessing the photocatalytic action of titanium
      dioxide in the presence of the various types of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the colloid in aqueous suspension may be sprayed or
      applied using a brush directly on the product in small successive
      amounts until the desired thickness is reached.<br>
      <br>
      UV and visible-light measurements using diffused-reflectance
      spectroscopy reveal the minimum quantity suitable for guaranteeing
      maximum light absorption by the TiO.sub.2.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative, the colloidal suspension can be vacuum-dried in
      order to obtain a titanium-dioxide powder which can be preserved
      for an unlimited period and re-suspended in water, maintaining its
      colloidal properties.<br>
      <br>
      When applied on the surface of cementitious, stone, or marble
      products, the colloidal preparations according to the present
      invention effectively protect the product from alterations due to
      organic pollutants, and in general from atmospheric agents, by
      causing their photo-oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, when inorganic pollutants do not find an organic
      substrate to adhere to, they encounter greater difficulties in
      depositing on the surface of the product<br>
      <br>
      As compared to the methods of the prior art, the application of
      the preparations in question guarantees a form of protection of
      the above-mentioned products that is long-lasting by using amounts
      of material, namely titanium dioxide or one of its precursors,
      that are considerably smaller than those required by the methods
      described previously.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the effectiveness of the titanium dioxide according
      to the present invention, possibly doped with metal ions belonging
      to groups I-VA, and the lanthanide or actinide series of the
      periodic table, as compared to the use of other formulations of
      titanium dioxide, considerably accelerates photo-oxidation of
      polluting agents, as illustrated in the assays described later
      (Examples 9, 10 and 11).<br>
      <br>
      Particularly surprising is the fact that the colloidal titanium
      dioxide prepared according to the present invention reveals
      excellent adhesion to the cementitious, marble or stone material
      to be protected.<br>
      <br>
      This was verified by subjecting specimens of cementitious and
      marble material treated with the titanium-dioxide colloidal
      suspension to leaching in water under stirring (Examples 7 and 8).<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that the colloid according to the present
      invention finds in cementitious, marble or stone materials an
      optimal substrate for the photocatalytic action envisaged, whilst
      for other materials, such as glass, adhesion of the colloid is
      possible only via a type or thermal treatment which is
      particularly burdensome, at approximately 5 000.degree. C., in the
      presence of an organic crosslinking agent.<br>
      <br>
      The activity of the colloidal preparation has moreover proved
      effective after various cycles of fouling with coloured organic
      substrates and subsequent cleaning of the specimens treated, thus
      demonstrating the effect of the photocatalyst over time. Examples
      of implementation of the present invention will now be described.
      In these examples, the percentage of dopant is to be understood
      calculated as metal-ion atoms with respect to the titanium atoms.<br>

      <br>
      The preparation in question is based on the controlled hydrolysis
      of the titanium-dioxide precursor. The typical preparation
      involves the addition of titanium isopropoxide to a solution 0.1 M
      of HNO.sub.3 to obtain 0.565 mol. of titanium dioxide per liter.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, in a 1-liter beaker containing water (750 ml) and
      HNO.sub.3 at a 65% concentration (5.2 ml), titanium isopropoxide
      (125 ml) was added slowly under vigorous stirring. The resulting
      solution was heated up to 80.degree. C. for 8-12 hours,
      maintaining vigorous stirring. In this way, the isopropanol that
      had formed was evaporated. The volume of the reaction mixture was
      kept at 200 ml by adding water.<br>

      <br>
      The colloid (10 ml) prepared as described in Examples 1-5 was put
      in a hermetically sealed glass container so as to hinder complete
      evaporation of the water and at the same time favour the regular
      growth of the particles from an average size of 50 .ANG. to a
      maximum size of 100/200 .ANG., and was then heated up to
      200-220.degree. C. overnight. The precipitated colloid was
      re-suspended by mechanical stirring and vacuum heat-concentrated
      until a concentration of 150 g/l was obtained. Next, Carbowax 2000
      (300 mg) was added, and the dispersion underwent stirring for 8
      hours until total dissolution of the Carbowax was achieved and a
      homogeneous suspension was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting product was spread on glass substrates and set to
      dry in a muffle oven at 500.degree. C. for 30 minutes. The film

      200-220.degree. C. overnight.<br>
      <br>
      Specimens of cementitious mortar (disks sized 25.times.8.times.2.5
      cm) were prepared using white cement Italbianco Italcementi 52.5
      R.<br>
      <br>
      After the preparation, the specimens were cured for 1 day in
      moulds in an environment at 20.degree. C. and relative humidity

      The aqueous suspension was brush-applied on the said specimens of
