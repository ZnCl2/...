                  to assist each
                  other, against all force offered to, or attacks made

                  therein all the privileges of trade and commerce,
                  subject to the same
                  duties, impositions, and restrictions as the
                  inhabitants thereof
                  respectively, provided that such restrictions shall
                  not extend so far
                  as to prevent the removal of property imported into
                  any State, to any
                  other State, of which the owner is an inhabitant;
                  provided also that no
                  imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any
                  State, on the

                  felony, or other
                  high misdemeanor in any State, shall flee from
                  justice, and be found in
                  any of the united States, he shall, upon demand of the
                  Governor or
                  executive power of the State from which he fled, be
                  delivered up and
                  removed to the State having jurisdiction of his
                  offense.<br>

                  Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these
                  States to the
                  records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the courts
                  and magistrates

                  State to recall its delegates, or any of them, at any
                  time within the
                  year, and to send others in their stead for the

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Article VI.</span> No

                  <br>
                  No State shall lay any imposts or duties, which may

                  united States, in
                  congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to
                  garrison the forts
                  necessary for the defense of such State; but every
                  State shall always
                  keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia,
                  sufficiently armed

                  actually invaded by
                  enemies, or shall have received certain advice of a
                  resolution being
                  formed by some nation of Indians to invade such State,
                  and the danger
                  is so imminent as not to admit of a delay till the
                  united States in
                  congress assembled can be consulted; nor shall any
                  State grant
                  commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor
                  letters of marque or

                  shall alternately
                  strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the
                  number shall be
                  reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less
                  than seven, nor more

                  presence of
                  Congress be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose
                  names shall be so
                  drawn or any five of them, shall be commissioners or
                  judges, to hear

                  judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the
                  determination: and
                  if either party shall neglect to attend at the day
                  appointed, without
                  showing reasons, which Congress shall judge
                  sufficient, or being
                  present shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall
                  proceed to nominate
                  three persons out of each State, and the secretary of
                  Congress shall
                  strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and
                  the judgement
                  and sentence of the court to be appointed, in the
                  manner before
                  prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any
                  of the parties
                  shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court,
                  or to appear or
                  defend their claim or cause, the court shall
                  nevertheless proceed to
                  pronounce sentence, or judgement, which shall in like
                  manner be final
                  and decisive, the judgement or sentence and other
                  proceedings being in
                  either case transmitted to Congress, and lodged among
                  the acts of
                  Congress for the security of the parties concerned:
                  provided that every
                  commissioner, before he sits in judgement, shall take
                  an oath to be
                  administered by one of the judges of the supreme or
                  superior court of
                  the State, where the cause shall be tried, 'well and
                  truly to hear and
                  determine the matter in question, according to the
                  best of his
                  judgement, without favor, affection or hope of
                  reward': provided also,
                  that no State shall be deprived of territory for the
                  benefit of the

                  jurisdictions as they may
                  respect such lands, and the States which passed such
                  grants are
                  adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at

                  may be in the same
                  manner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes

                  value of coin
                  struck by their own authority, or by that of the
                  respective States —

                  with the
                  Indians, not members of any of the States, provided
                  that the
                  legislative right of any State within its own limits
                  be not infringed
                  or violated — establishing or regulating post offices
                  from one State to
                  another, throughout all the United States, and
                  exacting such postage on
                  the papers passing through the same as may be
                  requisite to defray the
                  expenses of the said office — appointing all officers

                  proportion to the number
                  of white inhabitants in such State; which requisition
                  shall be binding,
                  and thereupon the legislature of each State shall
                  appoint the
                  regimental officers, raise the men and cloath, arm and
                  equip them in a
                  solid- like manner, at the expense of the United

                  Congress assembled
                  shall, on consideration of circumstances judge proper
                  that any State
                  should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number
                  of men than the
                  quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised,
                  officered, cloathed,
                  armed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of
                  each State,
                  unless the legislature of such State shall judge that
                  such extra number
                  cannot be safely spread out in the same, in which case
                  they shall
                  raise, officer, cloath, arm and equip as many of such
                  extra number as
                  they judge can be safely spared. And the officers and
                  men so cloathed,
                  armed, and equipped, shall march to the place
                  appointed, and within the
                  time agreed on by the united States in congress

                  appoint a
                  commander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine
                  States assent to
                  the same: nor shall a question on any other point,
                  except for
                  adjourning from day to day be determined, unless by
