      </div>
      <br>
      Pine Pollen refers to the pollen of trees in the pinus genera,
      which are sometimes used as dietary supplements. Scots Pine (Pinus
      sylvestris) contains testosterone at levels unlikely to affect the
      body, while other species may have antiinflammatory properties
      based on preliminary evidence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Primary Information, Benefits, Effects, and Important Facts</b><br>
      <br>
      Pine pollen is a term used to refer to supplements derived from
      the pollen of pine trees. Pine trees in general refer to the
      genera of pinus, and the pollen that is commonly used as a dietary
      supplement is the Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) due to some
      studies having detected a testosterone content in this pollen.<br>
      <br>
      In regards to the above, the testosterone content of Scots pine
      pollen appears to be too low to cause appreciable effects in the
      human body due to testosterone ingestion despite it being a higher
      concentration than the testosterone found in Royal Jelly. No
      studies have been conducted in humans on any parameter related to
      testosterone such as aphrodisia, muscle growth, or general male
      vitality.<br>
      <br>
      Pine pollen appears to have a traditional usage in Chinese
      medicine as well, although the species used have been those
      available in the region and these are not the Scots pine. These
      studies are preliminary but suggest a possible antiinflammatory
      effect that could benefit arthritis, but due to a lack of
      compositional studies on the pine pollen (ie. what is actually in
      the pollen that could be mediating the antiinflammatory effects)
      it is not known if these properties extend to Scots Pine.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, this supplement is heavily underresearched and at this
      moment in time it cannot be recommended for any particular usage
      in humans until more studies are conducted.<br>

          diploid fibroblasts and in a mouse model induced by
          D-galactose. </b><br>
        <b>Mao GX, et al. </b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      The present paper was designed to investigate the effect of pine
      pollen against aging in human diploid fibroblast 2BS cells and in
      an accelerated aging model, which was established by subcutaneous
      injections with D-galactose daily for 8 weeks in C57BL/6J mice.
      Pine pollen (1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL) is proved to delay the
      replicative senescence of 2BS cells as evidenced by enhanced cell
      proliferation, decreased SA-β-Gal activity, and reversed
      expression of senescence-associated molecular markers, such as
      p53, p21(Waf1), p16(INK4a), PTEN, and p27(Kip1) in late PD cells.
      Besides, pine pollen reversed D-galactose-induced aging effects in
      neural activity and inflammatory cytokine levels, as indicated by
      improved memory latency time and reduced error rate in step-down
      test and decreased concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α in model mice.
      Similar to the role of AGEs (advanced glycation endproducts)
      formation inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG), pine pollen inhibited
      D-galactose-induced increment of AGEs levels thus reversed the
      aging phenotypes in model mice. Furthermore, the declined
      antioxidant activity was obviously reversed upon pine pollen
      treatment, which may account for its inhibitory effect on
      nonenzymatic glycation (NEG) in vivo. Our finding presents pine
      pollen as an attractive agent with potential to retard aging and
      attenuate age-related diseases in humans.<br>

          pollen aqueous extract on CCl4-induced oxidative damage of
          human hepatic cells</b><br>
        <b>Xueyuan Jin, et al.</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Objective: We observed the effects of Masson pine pollen aqueous
      extracts (MPPAE) on CCl4-induced oxidative damage of the human
      hepatic cell line L-02. Methods: We created an in vitro model of
      oxidative liver damage by treating L-02 human hepatic cells with
      40 mmol/L CCl4. Effects of different concentrations of MPPAE on
      cell proliferation, morphology, and change of functional indexes
      were observed after addition of CCl4. Results: CCl4 was toxic to
      proliferation, cell morphology, and functionality of hepatic
      cells. It decreased proliferation by 29.3-38.4% and increased AST
      and ALT activities by 22.3% and 99.2%, respectively. The oxidative
      stress also disrupted hepatic cell growth and induced pyknosis.
      Although MPPAE did not prevent decreased proliferation of L-02
      cells, the treatment alleviated some CCl4-induced cell morphology
      changes and inhibited the abnormal rise of ALT (39.8%-70.1%) and
      AST (14.75-27.25%) activities in a dose dependent manner. A high
      dose of MPPAE (400 mg/L) ameliorated nucleus deformation to an
      almost normal appearance. Conclusions: According to our in vitro
      model, MPPAE specifically prevented the changes in cell morphology
      and functional injury caused by CCL4 treatment; however, it
      offered limited protection against damage-induced reduction of
      proliferation.<br>

      <b> </b><b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      The effects of pine pollen extract (PE) on Freund's complete
      adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritis and collagen-induced arthritis
      (CIA) were investigated. The oral administration of PE (100 and
      200 mg/kg per day) for 21 days after subcutaneous immunization
      with FCA, significantly reduced hindpaw swelling and the
      production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and
      IL-6) compared with the FCA-induced arthritis group. Treatment
      with the PE (100 mg/kg) also decreased the serum levels of
      LDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol contents compared
      with those of the arthritis group. Since CIA is a model of some
      types of human autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the study
      examined whether PE is efficacious against CIA in mice and
      investigated the possible antioxidant potential of PE on CIA.
      Arthritis in DBA/1J mice was induced by subcutaneous immunization
      with bovine type II collagen. PE (100 and 200 mg/kg) was orally
      administered once daily for 49 days after initial immunization
      with type II collagen. The arthritis score and paw edema were
      markedly suppressed in the groups treated with PE. Moreover,
      administration of PE (100 mg/kg) for 49 days reduced the serum
      levels of rheumatoid factor, anti-type II collagen antibody,
      TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, protein carbonyl, advanced glycation
      endproducts, malondialdehyde and LDL-cholesterol compared with
      that of CIA mice. These results suggest that the pine pollen might
      be beneficial in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that pine pollen can inhibit
      cerebral cortical cell apoptosis in mice with arsenic poisoning.
      The present study sought to detect the influence of pine pollen on
      apoptosis-related proteins. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting
      and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure the
      levels of apoptosis-related proteins in the cerebral cortex of
      mice with arsenic poisoning. Results indicated that pine pollen
      suppressed cell apoptosis in the cerebral cortex of
      arsenic-poisoned mice by reducing Bax, Bcl-2 protein expression
      and increasing p53 protein expression.<br>

        <b>Lee KH, Kim AJ, Choi EM</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>To determine the medicinal properties of pine pollen, the
      antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities of the ethanol extract
      of pine pollen extract (PPE) were investigated. PPE displayed a
      strong free radical scavenger activity on
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydrogen peroxide. It
      was observed also that the antioxidant activity, measured by the
      ferric thiocyanate method, increased with the addition of PPE to
      the linoleic acid emulsion system. PPE was also found to inhibit
      significantly the amount of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls
      formed from liver homogenate. Like the antioxidant activity, the
      reducing power of PPE was excellent. Thereafter, the study
      investigated the effects of PPE in modulating the production of
      pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated
      RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the effect of PPE on interleukin
      (IL)-1beta-induced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) production and
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation in the human
      synovial sarcoma cell line, SW982. PPE was found to inhibit the
      production of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 and
      IL-6 in LPS-activated macrophages. Treatment with PPE at 10
      microg/mL significantly (p &lt; 0.05) inhibited IL-1beta-induced
      MMPs (MMP-1 and -3) production in SW982 cells. IL-1beta-induced
      JNK activation was inhibited by PPE (10 microg/mL), whereas p38
      and ERK1/2 were not affected. These findings suggest that pine
      pollen is a potential antioxidant and beneficial for inflammatory
      conditions through down-regulation of JNK and MMPs.<br>
