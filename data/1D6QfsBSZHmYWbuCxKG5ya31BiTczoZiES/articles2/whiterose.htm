      <p>Nothing is so unworthy of a civilized nation as allowing itself
        to be "governed" without opposition by an irresponsible clique
        that has yielded to base instinct. It is certain that today
        every honest German is ashamed of his government. Who among us
        has any conception of the dimensions of shame that will befall
        us and our children when one day the veil has fallen from our
        eyes and the most horrible of crimes --- crimes that infinitely
        outdistance every human measure --- reach the light of day? </p>
      <p>If the German people are already so corrupted and spiritually
        crushed that they do not raise a hand, frivolously trusting in a
        questionable faith in lawful order in history; if they surrender
        man's highest principle, that which raises him above all other
        God's creatures, his free will; if they abandon the will to take
        decisive action and turn the wheel of history and thus subject
        it to their own rational decision; if they are so devoid of all
        individuality, have already gone so far along the road toward
        turning into a spiritless and cowardly mass --- then, yes, they
        deserve their downfall. </p>
      <p>Goethe speaks of the Germans as a tragic people, like the Jews
        and the Greeks, but today it would appear rather that they are a
        spineless, will-less herd of hangers-on, who now - the marrow
        sucked out of their bones, robbed of their center of stability
        --- are waiting to be hounded to their destruction. So it seems
        --- but it is not so. Rather, by means of a gradual,
        treacherous, systematic abuse, the system has put every man into
        a spiritual prison. Only now, finding himself lying in fetters,
        has he become aware of his fate. </p>
      <p>Only a few recognized the threat of ruin, and the reward for
        their heroic warning was death. We will have more to say about
        the fate of these persons. If everyone waits until the other man
        makes a start, the messengers of avenging Nemesis will come
        steadily closer; then even the last victim will have been cast
        senselessly into the maw of the insatiable demon. </p>
      <p>Therefore every individual, conscious of his responsibility as
        a member of Christian and Western civilization, must defend
        himself against the scourges of mankind, against fascism and any
        similar system of totalitarianism. Offer passive resistance ---
        resistance --- wherever you may be, forestall the spread of this
        atheistic war machine before it is too late, before the last
        cities, like Cologne, have been reduced to rubble, and before
        the nation's last young man has given his blood on some
        battlefield for the hubris of a sub-human. Do not forget that
        every people deserves the regime it is willing to endure. </p>
      <p>From Friedrich Schiller's "The Lawgiving of Lycurgus and
        Solon": </p>
      <blockquote>Viewed in relation to its purposes, the law code of
        Lycurgus is a masterpiece of political science and knowledge of
        human nature. He desired a powerful, unassailable state, firmly
        established on its own principles. Political effectiveness and
        permanence were the goal towards which he strove, and he
        attained this goal to the full extent possible under the
        circumstances. But if one compares the purpose Lycurgus had in
        view with the purposes of mankind, then a deep abhorrence takes
        the place of the approbation which we felt at first glance.
        Anything may be sacrificed to the good of the state except that
        end for which the State serves as a means. The state is never an
        end in itself; it is important only as a condition under which
        the purpose of mankind can be attained, and this purpose is none
        other than the development of all of man's powers, his progress
        and improvement. If a state prevents the development of the
        capacities which reside in man, if it interferes with the
        progress of the human spirit, then it is reprehensible and
        injurious, no matter how excellently devised, how perfect in its
        own way. Its very permanence in that case amounts more to a
        reproach than to a basis for fame; it becomes a prolonged evil,
        and the longer it endures, the more harmful it is...
        <p>At the price of all moral feeling a political system was set
          up, and the resources of the state were mobilized to that end.
          In Sparta there was no conjugal love, no mother love, no
          filial devotion, no friendship; all men were citizens only,
          and all virtue was civic virtue. </p>
        <p>A law of the state made it the duty of Spartans to be
          inhumane to their slaves; in these unhappy victims of war
          humanity itself was insulted and mistreated. In the Spartan
          code of law the dangerous principle was promulgated that men
          are to be looked upon as means and not as ends --- and the
          foundations of natural law and of morality were destroyed by
          that law... </p>
        <p>What an admirable sight is afforded, by contrast, by the
          rough soldier Gaius Marcius in his camp before Rome, when he
          renounced vengeance and victory because he could not endure to
          see a mother's tears!... </p>
        <p>The state [of Lycurgus] could endure only under the one
          condition: that the spirit of the people remained quiescent.
          Hence it could be maintained only if it failed to achieve the
          highest, the sole purpose of a state.</p>
      </blockquote>
      From Goethe's "The Awakening of Epimenides", Act II, Scene 4:
      <blockquote>SPIRITS: Though he who has boldly risen from the abyss
        Through an iron will and cunning May conquer half the world, Yet
        to the abyss he must return. Already a terrible fear has seized
        him; In vain he will resist! And all who still stand with him
        Must perish in his fall
        <p>HOPE: Now I find my good men Are gathered in the night, To
          wait in silence, not to sleep. And the glorious word of
          liberty They whisper and murmur, Till in unaccustomed
          strangeness, On the steps of our temple Once again in delight
          they cry: Freedom! Freedom!</p>

      <p><br>
        It is impossible to engage in intellectual discourse with
        National Socialism because it is not an intellectually
        defensible program. It is false to speak of a National Socialist
        philosophy, for if there were such an entity, one would have to
        try by means of analysis and discussion either to prove its
        validity or to combat it. In actuality, however, we face a
        totally different situation. </p>
      <p>At its very inception this movement depended on the deception
        and betrayal of one's fellow man; even at that time it was
        inwardly corrupt and could support itself only by constant lies.
        After all, Hitler states in an early edition of "his" book (a
        book written in the worst German I have ever read, in spite of
        the fact that it has been elevated to the position of the Bible
        in this nation of poets and thinkers): "It is unbelievable, to
        what extent one must betray a people in order to rule it." </p>
      <p>If at the start this cancerous growth in the nation was not
        particularly noticeable, it was only because there were still
        enough forces at work that operated for the good, so that it was
        kept under control. As it grew larger, however, and finally in
        an ultimate spurt of growth attained ruling power, the tumor
        broke open, as it were, and infected the whole body. The greater
        part of its former opponents went into hiding. The German
        intellectuals fled to their cellars, there, like plants
        struggling in the dark, away from light and sun, gradually to
        choke to death. </p>
      <p>Now the end is at hand. Now it is our task to find one another
        again, to spread information from person to person, to keep a
        steady purpose, and to allow ourselves no rest until the last
        man in persuaded of the urgent need of his struggle against this
        system. When thus a wave of unrest goes through the land, when
        "it is in the air", when many join the cause, then in a great
        final effort this system can be shaken off. After all, and end
        in terror is preferable to terror without end. </p>
      <p>We are not in a position to draw up a final judgment about the
        meaning of our history. But if this catastrophe can be used to
        further the public welfare, it will be only by virtue of the
        fact that we are cleansed by suffering; that we yearn for the
        light in the midst of deepest night, summon our strength, and
        finally help in shaking off the yoke which weighs on our world.
      </p>
      <p>We do not want to discuss here the question of the Jews, nor do
        we want in this leaflet to compose a defense or apology. No,
        only by way of example do we want to cite the fact that since
        the conquest of Poland three hundred thousand Jews have been
        murdered in this country in the most bestial way. Here we see
        the most frightful crime against human dignity, a crime that is
        unparalleled in the whole of history. For Jews, too, are human
        beings --- no matter what position we take with respect to the
        Jewish question --- and a crime of this dimension has been
        perpetrated against human beings. </p>
      <p>Someone may say that the Jews deserved their fate. This
        assertion would be a monstrous impertinence; but let us assume
        that someone said this - what position has he then taken toward
        the fact that the entire Polish aristocratic youth is being
        annihilated? (May God grant that this program has not fully
        achieved its aim as yet!) All male offspring of the houses of
        the nobility between the ages of fifteen and twenty were
        transported to concentration camps in Germany and sentenced to
        forced labor, and the girls of this age group were sent to
        Norway, into the bordellos of the SS! </p>
      <p>Why tell you these things, since you are fully aware of them -
        or if not of these, then of other equally grave crimes committed
        by this frightful sub-humanity? Because here we touch on a
        problem which involves us deeply and forces us all to take
        thought. Why do the German people behave so apathetically in the
        face of all these abominable crimes, crimes so unworthy of the
        human race? Hardly anyone thinks about that. It is accepted as
        fact and put out of mind. The German people slumber on in their
        dull, stupid sleep and encourage these fascist criminals; they
        give them the opportunity to carry on their depredations; and of
        course they do so. Is this a sign that the Germans are
        brutalized in their simplest human feelings, that no chord
        within them cried out at the sight of such deeds, that they have
        sunk into a fatal consciencelessness from which they will never,
        never awake? </p>
      <p>It seems to be so, and will certainly be so, if the German does
        not at least start up out of his stupor, if he does not protest
        wherever and whenever he can against this clique of criminals,
        if he shows no sympathy for these hundreds of thousands of
        victims. He must evidence not only sympathy; no, much more: a
        sense of complicity in guilt. For through his apathetic behavior
        he gives these evil men the opportunity to act as they do; he
        tolerates this "government" which has taken upon itself such an
        infinitely great burden of guilt; indeed, he himself is to blame
        for the fact that it came about at all! Each man wants to be
        exonerated of a guilt of this kind, each one continues on his
        way with the most placid, the calmest conscience. But he cannot
        be exonerated; he is guilty, guilty, guilty! </p>
      <p>It is not too late, however, to do away with this most
        reprehensible of all miscarriages of government, so as to avoid
        being burdened with even greater guilt. Now, when in recent
        years our eyes have been opened, when we know exactly who our
        adversary is, it is high time to root out this brown horde. Up
        until the outbreak of the war the larger part of the German
        people were blinded; the Nazis did not show themselves in their
        true aspect. But now, now that we have recognized them for what
        they are, it must be the sole and first duty, the holiest duty
        of every German to destroy these beasts. </p>
      <blockquote>"If the people are barely aware that the government
        exists, they are happy. When the government is felt to be
        oppressive, they are broken. " "Good fortune, alas! builds
        itself upon misery. Good fortune, alas! is the mask of misery.
        What will come of this? We cannot foresee the end. Order is
        upset and turns to disorder, good becomes evil. The people are
        confused. Is it not so, day in, day out, from the beginning? "
        "The wise man is therefore angular, though he does not injure
        others: he has sharp corners, though he does not harm; he is
        upright but not gruff. He is clear-minded, but he does not try
        to be brilliant." --- Lao Tzu
        <p>"Whoever undertakes to rule the kingdom and to shape it
          according to his whim --- I foresee that he will fail to reach
          his goal. That is all. " "The kingdom is a living being. It
          cannot be constructed, in truth! He who tries to manipulate it
          will spoil it, he who tries to put it under his power will
          lose it. " "Therefore: Some creatures go out in front, others
          follow, some have warm breath, others cold, some are strong,
          some weak, some attain abundance, other succumb. " "The wise
          man will accordingly forswear excess, he will avoid arrogance
          and not overreach." --- Lao Tzu</p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Third Pamphlet</font></b></p>

      <p><i>Salus publica suprema lex</i> </p>
      <p>All ideal forms of government are utopias. A state cannot be
        constructed on a purely theoretical basis; rather, it must grow
        and ripen in the way an individual human being matures. But we
        must not forget that at the starting point of every civilization
        the state was already there in rudimentary form. The family is
        as old as man himself, and out of this initial bond man, endowed
        with reason, created for himself a state founded on justice,
        whose highest law was the common good. The state should exist as
        a parallel to the divine order, and the highest of all utopias,
        <i>the civitas dei</i>, is the model which in the end it should
        approximate. </p>
      <p>Here we will not pass judgment on the many possible forms of
        the state - democracy, constitutional monarchy, and so on. But
        one matter needs to be brought out clearly and unambiguously.
        Every individual human being has a claim to a useful and just
        state, a state which secures the freedom of the individual as
        well as the good of the whole. For, according to God's will, man
        is intended to pursue his natural goal, his earthly happiness,
        in self-reliance and self-chosen activity, freely and
        independently within the community of life and work of the
        nation. </p>
      <p>But our present "state" is the dictatorship of evil. "Oh, we've
        known that for a long time," I hear you object, "and it isn't
        necessary to bring that to our attention again." But, I ask you,
        if you know that, why do you not bestir yourselves, why do you
        allow these men who are in power to rob you step by step, openly
        and in secret, of one domain of your rights after another, until
        one day nothing, nothing at all will be left but a mechanized
        state system presided over by criminals and drunks? Is your
        spirit already so crushed by abuse that you forget it is your
        right --- or rather, your <i>moral duty</i> --- to eliminate
        this system? </p>
      <p>But if a man no longer can summon the strength to demand his
        right, then it is absolutely certain that he will perish. We
        would deserve to be dispersed through the earth like dust before
        the wind if we do not muster our powers at this late hour and
        finally find the courage which up to now we have lacked. Do not
        hide your cowardice behind a cloak of expediency, for with every
        new day that you hesitate, failing to oppose this offspring of
        Hell, your guilt, as in a parabolic curve, grows higher and
        higher. </p>
      <p>Many, perhaps most, of the readers of these leaflets do not see
        clearly how they can practice an effective opposition. They do
        not see any avenues open to them. We want to try to show them
        that everyone is in a position to contribute to the overthrow of
        this system. It is not possible through solitary withdrawal, in
        the manner of embittered hermits, to prepare the ground for the
        overturn of this "government" or bring about the revolution at
        the earliest possible moment. No, it can be done only by the
        cooperation of many convinced, energetic people - people who are
        agreed as to the means they must use to attain their goal. </p>
      <p>We have no great number of choices as to these means. The only
        one available is <i>passive resistance</i>. The meaning and the
        goal of passive resistance is to topple National Socialism, and
        in this struggle we must not recoil from any course, any action,
        whatever its nature. At <i>all</i> points we must oppose
        National Socialism, wherever it is open to attack. We must soon
        bring this monster of a state to an end. A victory of fascist
        Germany in this war would have immeasurable, frightful
        consequences. The military victory over Bolshevism dare not
        become the primary concern of the Germans. The defeat of the
        Nazis must <i>unconditionally</i> be the first order of
        business. The greater necessity of this latter requirement will
        be discussed in one of our forthcoming leaflets. </p>
      <p>And now every convinced opponent of National Socialism must ask
        himself how he can fight against the present "state" in the most
        effective way, how he can strike it the most telling blows.
        Through passive resistance, without a doubt. We cannot provide
        each man with the blueprint for his acts, we can only suggest
        them in general terms, and he alone will find the way of
        achieving this end: </p>
      <p><i>Sabotage</i> in armament plants and war industries, sabotage
        at all gatherings, rallies, public ceremonies, and organizations
        of the National Socialist Party. Obstruction of the smooth
        functioning of the war machine (a machine for war that goes on
        solely to shore up and perpetuate the National Socialist Party
        and its dictatorship). <i>Sabotage</i> in all the areas of
        science and scholarship which further the continuation of the
        war --- whether in universities, technical schools,
        laboratories, research institutions, or technical bureaus. <i>Sabotage</i>
        in all cultural institutions which could potentially enhance the
        "prestige" of the fascists among the people. <i>Sabotage</i> in
        all branches of the arts which have even the slightest
        dependence on National Socialism or render it service. <i>Sabotage</i>
        in all publications, all newspapers, that are in the pay of the
        "government" and that defend its ideology and aid in
        disseminating the brown lie. </p>
      <p>Do not give a penny to the public drives (even when they are
        conducted under the pretense of charity). For this is only a
        disguise. In reality the proceeds aid neither the Red Cross nor

        financially interested in these money drives. After all, the
        presses run continuously to manufacture any desired amount of

        the nature of tyranny] to strive to see to it that nothing is
        kept hidden of that which any subject says or does, but that
        everywhere he will be spied upon,... and further, to set man
        against man and friend against friend, and the common people
        against the privileged and the wealthy. Also it is part of these
        tyrannical measures, to keep the subjects poor, in order to pay
        the guards and the soldiers, and so that they will be occupied
        with earning their livelihood and will have neither leisure nor
        opportunity to engage in conspiratorial acts... Further, [to
        levy] such taxes on income as were imposed in Syracuse, for
        under Dionysius the citizens gladly paid out their whole
        fortunes in taxes within five years. Also, the tyrant is
        inclined constantly to foment wars" </p>

      <p>There is an ancient maxim that we repeat to our children: "He
        who won't listen will have to feel." But a wise child will not
        burn his fingers the second time on a hot stove. In the past
        weeks Hitler has choked up successes in Africa and in Russia. In
        consequence, optimism on the one hand and distress and pessimism
        on the other have grown within the German people with a rapidity
        quite inconsistent with traditional German apathy. On all sides
        one hears among Hitler's opponents --- the better segments of
        the population --- exclamations of despair, words of
        disappointment and discouragement, often ending with the
        question: "Will Hitler now, after all...?" </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the German offensive against Egypt has ground to a
        halt. Rommel has to bide his time in a dangerously exposed
        position. But the push into the East proceeds. This apparent
        success has been purchased at the most horrible expense of human
        life, and so it can no longer be counted an advantage. Therefore
        we must warn against all optimism. </p>
      <p>Neither Hitler nor Goebbels can have counted the dead. In
        Russia thousands are lost daily. It is the time of the harvest,
        and the reaper cuts into the ripe grain with wide strokes.
        Mourning takes up her abode in the country cottages, and there
        is no one to dry the tears of the mothers. Yet Hitler feeds with
        lies those people whose most precious belongings he has stolen
        and whom he has driven to a meaningless death. </p>
      <p>Every word that comes from Hitler's mouth is a lie. When he
        says peace, he means war, and when he blasphemously uses the
        name of the Almighty, he means the power of evil, the fallen
        angel, Satan. His mouth is the foul-smelling maw of Hell, and
        his might is at bottom accursed. True, we must conduct a
        struggle against the National Socialist terrorist state with
        rational means; but whoever today still doublts the reality, the
        existence of demonic powers, has failed by a wide margin to
        understand the metaphysical background of this war. Behind the
        concrete, the visible events, behind all objective, logical
        considerations, we find the irrational element: The struggle
        against the demon, against the servants of the Antichrist.
        Everywhere and at all times demons have been lurking in the
        dark, waiting for the moment when man is weak; when of his own
        volition he leaves his place in the order of Creation as founded
        for him by God in freedom; when he yields to the force of evil,
        separates himself from the powers of a higher order; and after
        voluntarily taking the first step, he is driven on to the next
        and the next at a furiously accelerating rate. Everywhere and at
        all times of greatest trial men have appeared, prophets and
        saints who cherished their freedom, who preached the One God and
        who His help brought the people to a reversal of their downward
        course. Man is free, to be sure, but without the true God he is
        defenseless against the principle of evil. He is a like
        rudderless ship, at the mercy of the storm, an infant without
        his mother, a cloud dissolving into thin air. </p>
      <p>I ask you, you as a Christian wrestling for the preservation of
        your greatest treasure, whether you hesitate, whether you
        incline toward intrigue, calculation, or procrastination in the
        hope that someone else will raise his arm in your defense? Has
        God not given you the strength, the will to fight? We must
        attack evil where it is strongest, and it is strongest in the
        power of Hitler. </p>
      <p>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done
        under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed,
        and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
        there was power; but they had no comforter. Wherefore I praised
        the dead which are already dead than the living which are yet
        alive. <i>Ecclesiastes 4</i> </p>
      <p>True anarchy is the generative element of religion. Out of the
        annihilation of every positive element she lifts her gloriously
        radiant countenance as the founder of a new world... If Europe
        were about to awaken again, if a state of states, a teaching of
        political science were at hand! Should hierarchy then... be the
        principle of the union of states? Blood will stream over Europe
        until the nations become aware of the frightful madness which
        drives them in circles. And then, struck by celestial music and
        made gentle, the approach their former altars all together, hear
        about the works of peace, and hold a great celebration of peace
        with fervent tears before the smoking altars. Only religion can
        reawaken Europe, establish the rights of the peoples, and
        install Christianity in new splendor visibly on earth in its
        office as guarantor of peace. Novalis </p>
      <p>We wish expressly to point out that the White Rose is not in
        the pay of any foreign power. Though we know that National
        Socialist power must be broken by military means, we are trying
        to achieve a renewal from within of the severely wounded German
        spirit. This rebirth must be preceded, however, by the clear
        recognition of all the guilt with which the German people have
        burdened themselves, and by an uncompromising battle against
        Hitler and his all too many minions, party members, Quislings,
        and the like. With total brutality the chasm that separates the
        better portion of the nation from everything that is opened
        wide. For Hitler and his followers there is no punishment on
        this Earth commensurate with their crimes. But out of love for
        coming generations we must make an example after the conclusion
        of the war, so that no one will ever again have the slightest
        urge to try a similar action. And do not forget the petty
        scoundrels in this regime; note their names, so that none will
        go free! They should not find it possible, having had their part
        in these abominable crimes, at the last minute to rally to
        another flag and then act as if nothing had happened! To set you
        at rest, we add that the addresses of the readers of the White
        Rose are not recorded in writing. They were picked at random
        from directories. </p>
      <p>We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White
        Rose will not leave you in peace! </p>

      <p>A Call to All Germans! </p>
      <p>The war is approaching its destined end. As in the year 1918,
        the German government is trying to focus attention exclusively
        on the growing threat of submarine warfare, while in the East
        the armies are constantly in retreat and invasion in imminent in
        the West. Mobiliation in the United States has not yet reached
        its climax, but already it exceeds anything that the world has
        ever seen. It has become a mathematical certainty that Hitler is
        leading the German people into the abyss. Hitler cannot win the
        war; he can only prolong it. The guilt of Hitler and his minions
        goes beyond all measure. Retribution comes closer and closer. </p>
      <p>But what are the German people doing? They will not see and
        will not listen. Blindly they follow their seducers into ruin.
        Victory at any price! is inscribed on their banner. "I will
        fight to the last man," says Hitler --- but in the meantime the
        war has already been lost. </p>
      <p>Germans! Do you and your children want to suffer the same fate
        that befell the Jews? Do you want to be judged by the same
        standards as are your traducers? Are we to be forever a nation
        which is hated and rejected by all mankind? No. Dissociate
        yourselves from National Socialist gangsterism. Prove by your
        deeds that you think otherwise. A new war of liberation is about
        to begin. The better part of the nation will fight on our side.
        Cast off the cloak of indifference you have wrapped around you.
        Make the decision before it is too late. Do not believe the
        National Socialist propoganda which has driven the fear of
        Bolshevism into your bones. Do not believe that Germany's
        welfare is linked to the victory of national Socialism for good
        or ill. A criminal regime cannot achieve a German victory.
        Separate yourselves in time from everything connected with
        National Socialism. In the aftermath a terrible but just
        judgment will be meted out to those who stayed in hiding, who
        were cowardly and hesitant. </p>
      <p>What can we learn from the outcome of this war-this war that
        never was a national war? </p>
      <p>The imperialist ideology of force, from whatever side it comes,
        must be shattered for all time. A one sided Prussian militarism
        must never again be allowed to assume power. Only in large-scale
        cooperation among the nations of Europe can the ground be
        prepared for reconstruction. Centralized hegemony, such as the
        Prussian state has tried to excercise in Germany and in Europe,
        must be cut down at its inception. The Germany of the future
        must be a federal state. At this juncture only a sound federal
        system can inbue a weakened Europe with a new life. The workers
        must be liberated from their condition of down trodden slavery
        under National Socialism. The illusory structure of autonomous
        national industry must disappear. Every nation and each man have
        a right to the goods of the whole world! </p>
      <p>Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the protection of
        individual citizens from the abritrary will of criminal regimes
        of violence --- these will be the bases of the New Europe. </p>
      <p>Support the resistance. Distribute the leaflets! </p>

      <p>Fellow Fighters in the Resistance! </p>
      <p>Shaken and broken, our people behold the loss of the men of
        Stalingrad. Three hundred and thirty thousand German men have
        been senselessly and irresponsibly driven to death and
        destruction by the inspired strategy of our World War I Private
        First Class. Fuhrer, we thank you! </p>
      <p>The German people are in ferment. Will we continue to entrust
        the fate of our armies to a dilettante? Do we want to sacrifice
        the rest of German youth to the base ambitions of a Party
        clique? No, never! The day of reckoning has come --- the
        reckoning of German youth with the most abominable tyrant our
        people have ever been forced to endure. In the name of German
        youth we demand restitution by Adolf Hitler's state of our
        personal freedom, the most precious treasure we have, out of
        which he has swindled us in the most miserable way. </p>
      <p>We grew up in a state in which all free expression of opinion
        is unscrupulously suppressed. The Hitler Youth, the SA, the SS
        have tried to drug us, to revolutionize us, to regiment us in
        the most promising young years of our lives. "Philosophical
        training" is the name given to the despicable method by which
        our budding intellectual development is muffled in a fog of
        empty phrases. A system of selection of leaders at once
        unimaginably devilish and narrow-minded trains up its future
        party bigwigs in the "Castles of the Knightly Order" to become
        Godless, impudent, and conscienceless exploiters and
        executioners --- blind, stupid hangers-on of the Fuhrer. We
        "Intellectual Workers" are the ones who should put obstacles in
        the path of this caste of overlords. Soldiers at the front are
        regimented like schoolboys by student leaders and trainees for
        the post of Gauleiter, and the lewd jokes of the Gauleiters
        insult the honor of the women students. German women students at
        the university in Munich have given a dignified reply to the
        besmirching of their honor, and German students have defended
        the women in the universities and have stood firm.... That is a
        beginning of the struggle for our free self-determination ---
        without which intellectual and spiritual values cannot be
        created. We thank the brave comrades, both men and women, who
        have set us brilliant examples. </p>
      <p>For us there is but one slogan: fight against the party! Get
        out of the party organization, which are used to keep our mouths
        sealed and hold us in political bondage! Get out of the lecture
        rooms of the SS corporals and sergeants and the party
        bootlickers! We want genuine learning and real freedom of
        opinion. No threat can terrorize us, not even the shutting down
        of the institutions of higher learning. This is the struggle of
        each and every one of us for our future, our freedom, and our
        honor under a regime conscious of its moral responsibility. </p>
      <p>Freedom and honor! For ten long years Hitler and his coadjutor
        have manhandled, squeezed, twisted, and debased these two
        splendid German words to the point of nausea, as only
        dilettantes can, casting the highest values of a nation before
        swine. They have sufficiently demonstrated in the ten years of
        destruction of all material and intellectual freedom, of all
        moral substance among the German people, what they understand by
        freedom and honor. The frightful bloodbath has opened the eyes
        of even the stupidest German - it is a slaughter which they
        arranged in the name of freedom and honor of the German nation"
        throughout Europe, and which they daily start anew. The name of
        Germany is dishonored for all time if German youth does not
        finally rise, take revenge, and atone, smash its tormentors, and
        set up a new Europe of the spirit. Students! The German people
        look to us. As in 1813 the people expected us to shake off the
        Napoleonic yoke, so in 1943 they look to us to break the
        National Socialist terror through the power of the spirit.
        Beresina and Stalingrad are burning in the East. The dead of
        Stalingrad implore us to take action. "Up, up, my people, let
        smoke and flame be our sign!" </p>
      <p>Our people stand ready to rebel against the Nationals Socialist
        enslavement of Europe in a fervent new breakthrough of freedom
        and honor. </p>

          <b>Copyright © 1997</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Introduction and Background</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty-four years ago three German students
        were arrested. A few days later they were hauled before the
        Volksgerichtshof ("People's Court"), sentenced to death and
        executed by beheading the same day. Within a few months many
        more arrests were made, and, in a second trial, three additional
        death sentences were handed down. (The "People's Court," I
        should add, existed outside the German constitution. It was
        created by the NSDAP, the National Socialist Party, in 1934 for
        the sole purpose of eliminating Hitler's enemies.) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can one explain that after ten years of
        Nazi rule, with its incessant political indoctrination beginning
        as early as in preschool, and in the midst of a "great patriotic
        war," these students, who had largely grown up under the
        influence of this regime, resolved to take a stand against Nazi
        tyranny? To accomplish this it will be necessary to expand
        somewhat on the historical background. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my firm belief that no one raised in
        the United States can fully comprehend what it is like to live
        under an absolute dictatorship. For it is quite different from
        what we generally associate with this term as it relates, for
        example, to the typical Latin American situation. Never before
        has there been such absolute control, except for Soviet Russia,
        which Hitler actually emulated to a large degree. The government
        - or rather, the party - controlled everything: the news media,
        arms, police, the armed forces, the judiciary system,
        communications, travel, all levels of education from
        kindergarten to universities, all cultural and religious
        institutions. Political indoctrination started at a very early
        age, and continued by means of the Hitler Youth with the
        ultimate goal of complete mind control. Children were exhorted
        in school to denounce even their own parents for derogatory
        remarks about Hitler or Nazi ideology. My own teenage cousin,
        for instance, threatened to denounce his father; and I was
        barely able to deter him by pointing out to him that he himself
        might end up destitute, if his father were arrested and
        incarcerated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organized resistance was practically
        impossible. One could not speak openly, even with close friends,
        never knowing whether they might not be Nazi spies or
        collaborators. So well organized was the control and
        surveillance by the party, that each city block had a party
        functionary assigned to spy on his neighbors. This "Blockwart"
        was ostensibly responsible for the well being of the residents
        of his city block, but in reality had to monitor, record and
        report on activities, conversations, and remarks of each person,
        as well as on their associations. Even the privacy of one's home
        was not assured: a tea cozy or pillows placed over the telephone
        were popular precautions against eavesdropping by bugging. Nor
        did one ever know what mail had been secretly opened. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember only too well an incident in a
        cinema: someone sitting a few rows in front of me was led away
        by the Gestapo. Apparently he had made a derogatory remark to
        his companion about Hitler during the preceding news reel.
        Whoever had overheard him must have, as a patriotic duty, tipped
        off the secret police. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, there were individuals, and small,
        local groups who were opposed to the regime. As a matter of
        fact, we now know that there were over 300 of them; but because
        of the conditions described above, it was nearly impossible to
        establish contacts, let alone to maintain communications. Thus
        the existing groups were small, isolated, and did not know of
        each other. Any successful resistance could only have come from
        the Military; they tried, very late, on that fateful July 20,
        1944 - and bungled it badly. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I am coming back to the question:
        how was it possible that a group of university students defied
        this powerful regime - and, against all odds, called for open
        resistance? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is twofold: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We were students, and students,
        throughout history, have been idealistic, rebellious, and
        willing to take chances: rebellious against existing order,
        against old and empty conventions (the United States and Europe
        experienced their share of it in the Sixties). Most of our group
        had been members of the "Bündische Jugend." These were youth
        organizations (somewhat similar to the Boy Scouts,) which had
        come into being around 1908 in Europe and were particularly
        strong in Germany. In essence they grew out of a disillusionment
        of young people with the old established order, and with
        schools, which had failed them badly, as well as rebellion
        against overbearing parents. They were infused with typically
        German romanticism. Their ideals and stated goals were: personal
        freedom, self-imposed discipline, and strict adherence to
        highest moral and ethical principles. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. These students came from bourgeois
        families. Their parents were opposed to Hitler, which must have
        influenced them to a large degree. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Most of us were medical students, except
        for Sophie Scholl, who majored in biology and philosophy. We
        shared a common interest in and a deep love for the arts, music,
        literature, and philosophy. Most of us had Jewish friends or
        classmates, who were evicted or deported or who had suffered in
        the "Crystal Night" pogrom. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all began, if you will, in the winter of
        1938/39: Those who served their compulsory two year army service
        and planned to enter medical school were consigned to a
        "Sanitätskompanie," a training school for medics, for their
        final six months. This is where I met Alexander Schmorell: he
        was multi-talented, a gifted sculptor, deeply interested in
        literature and music; he was born in Russia, to a German father,
        a physician, and a Russian mother. We soon discovered our
        similar political leanings, and became close friends. Some of
        you may have read in one of the books about the White Rose, what
        Alex Schmorell said to me, pointing to the door of our room in
        the barracks: "Maybe ten years from now there will be a plaque
        on this door which will read: 'This is where the revolution
        began'." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the following spring (1939) most of us
        enrolled at the University of Munich. There were two days of
        required political indoctrination, which no one took seriously.
        Although fraternities had been dissolved and incorporated into
        the National Socialist Student Organization, we felt exhilarated
        by the degree of freedom one enjoyed as a student, compared to
        what lay behind us: namely six months of "Arbeitsdienst" (a
        compulsory paramilitary work service in uniform), followed by
        two years of military service. Yet, most kept their opinions to
        themselves in view of the palpable sense of oppression, of being
        watched, and the ever looming threat of concentration camps. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, student unrest was smoldering. For
        example, at the end of the summer semester, the leader of the
        Nazi student organization (for the state of Bavaria) ordered a
        convocation, in which he informed us that we were ordered to
        spend our summer vacation bringing in the harvest, otherwise we
        would not be permitted to re-enroll for the fall semester. There
        were demonstrations, students at the chemistry department set
        off stink bombs, and the Gestapo (secret police) was brought in.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after World War Two was unleashed by
        Germany's invasion of Poland (in Sept. 1939) most medical
        students were drafted, housed in barracks, and required to
        attend classes in uniform. In the beginning, this was carried
        out in typically Prussian manner: students were crowded into
        barracks, up to ten to a room, which made studying extremely
        difficult; marching to class in columns in the morning,
        returning the same way in the evenings. Eventually the absurdity
        and impracticality of this became obvious, and more freedom was
        permitted; we were allowed to live in private quarters, and to
        even wear civilian clothes during our senior year. Only Saturday
        morning roll call and drill remained mandatory. Many of us would
        not show up, and friends would respond for those missing during
        roll call, shouting "here" when their names were called. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this student company I introduced Alex
        Schmorell and Hans Scholl to each other. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The White Rose</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The White Rose is a shining example of resistance to Hitler,
        but also of the ruthlessness which the Nazis authorities showed
        when faced with any opposition. In early 1943, the fortunes of
        war were clearly turning against the Germans. The battle of
        Stalingrad had been a complete disaster, resulting in the
        surrender of the Sixth Army on January 31, 1943. Around this
        time, a small group of students, mostly centered in the
        University of Munich, began openly to agitate against the Nazi
        regime. They saw the war as lost, the good things they had
        thought would result from the Nazis in the 1930s as having been
        thrown away, and were horrified at the mistreatment of the Jews.
        The leaders of the student revolt were Hans Scholl (25), a
        medical student and his sister Sophie (21), a biology student.
        Hans Scholl had been an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth
        in 1933, but he quickly became disillusioned with Nazism as its
        inhumanity and barbarism became more and more clear with the
        passage of time. </p>
      <p>People who have never lived under a totalitarian government
        have difficulty understanding how difficult it was - and how
        dangerous - to organize opposition to the government. The Nazis
        in particular were organized right down to the street level and
        people were encouraged to inform on their parents, relatives,
        and friends to the Gestapo; in short, anyone who manifested
        disagreement with the Nazis could be in serious trouble. Under
        the law of the Third Reich, over 5,000 people were executed for
        such trivial offenses as making jokes about Hitler or listening
        to radio broadcasts from Britain. </p>
      <p>Most of the White Rose members were medical students, except
        for Sophie Scholl, who majored in biology and philosophy, and
        many had Jewish friends or classmates, who had been persecuted
        under the Nazis, Their disillusionment became most pronounced as
        the brutality of the regime became more apparent and especially
        when the mass deportations of the Jews began. </p>
      <p>The White Rose began distributing anti-government leaflets in
        mid 1942. The main authors were Hans Scholl, Alex Schmorell, and
        George </p>
      <p>Wittenstein (see below) who wrote four leaflets and distributed
        about 100 copies of them. Of the 100, 35 fell into the hands of
        the Gestapo. At about this time, Sophie Scholl joined the group.
        It is known that Hans Scholl coined the expression "leaflets of
        the White Rose", but the origin of the expression is unclear.
        The leaflets protested against the brutality and evil of the
        government, and against the extermination of the Jews, which was
        beginning to become known to more and more people at this time.
      </p>
      <p>In summer 1942, many of the male medical students at the
        University of Munich were obliged to serve a three-month stint
        on the Russian front. Several of the White Rose members were
        among them. There they saw with their own eyes the horrors of
        war, and there they also saw the unbelievable cruelty the
        Germans displayed to the Jews. They personally witnessed
        beatings and other mistreatment and heard reliable stories of
        the persecution of the Jews then in full swing. They returned in
        November 1942. </p>
      <p>In February 1943, the Gauleiter (District Leader) of Bavaria,
        Paul Giesler, addressed the students at the University of
        Munich. By then, he was already aware of some of the White Rose
        activities. He sneeringly said that the female students should
        be producing children for the Reich rather than wasting time
        studying and added: "If some of the girls lack sufficient charm
        to find a mate, I will assign each of them one of my adjutants."
        Female students who attempted to leave the session were arrested
        by the Gestapo, which led to a general riot and the eventual
        freedom of the women. </p>
      <p>Several more activist leaflets soon followed, more and more
        revolutionary in nature, with the last ones calling openly for
        the overthrow of the government. By a stroke of bad luck, Sophie
        and Hans Scholl were observed dumping some of these leaflets out
        of a window at the university, were betrayed to the Gestapo and
        arrested. More than 80 arrests throughout Germany soon followed.
      </p>
      <p>The Scholls and another collaborator were almost immediately
        (February 22, 1943) brought before the People's Court
        (Volksgerichtshof), a creation of the Nazi Party and feared for
        its denial of justice and cruelty. They were convicted of
        treason in a trial lasting only about 4 hours and sentenced to
        death by guillotine. Sophie Scholl had been mistreated so much
        in her "questioning" by the Gestapo that she arrived in court
        with a broken leg. But in a display of great courage, she stood
        up to the President of the Court, Roland Freisler (known for his
        perversion of justice), saying: "You know as well as we do that
        the war is lost. Why are you so cowardly that you won't admit
        it?" </p>
      <p>The Scholls were executed the same day. A few days later,
        several of their colleagues were executed. The White Rose was
        finished. </p>
      <p>Although they actually accomplished little (obviously they had
        no realistic chance of accomplishing very much from the outset),
        the White Rose students serve as an example that not all Germans
        blindly went along with Hitler. Their activities are important
        to include in any assessment of the reaction of Germans to
        Hitler, and what is striking is that the persecution of the Jews
        played a major role in galvanizing them into more open and
        radical opposition to the Hitler government. In spite of the
        difficulties they faced, they were imbued with a willingness to
        risk it all for their country and for the victims of its
        terrible practices. That they failed was perhaps preordained;
        that they dared to try is a testament to their humanity. <br>

      <p>Excerpt from: Gill, Anton. <i>An Honourable Defeat</i> ; NY,
        Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1994.&nbsp; pp. 183-195 </p>
      <p>Today, the main square outside the University of Munich is
        called Geschwister-Scholl-Platz. The name commemorates a small
        group of students who, operating independently, managed to
        create one of the few single protests of great significance
        outside the main body of the Resistance, in the town which had,
        throughout the mid-thirties, advertised itself on tourist
        brochures as 'The Birthplace of the Party'. </p>
      <p>Hans and Sophie Scholl were the second and fourth of the five
        children of Robert Scholl, the liberal and independent mayor of
        the little town of Forchtenberg on the River Kocher to the east
        of Heilbronn. He was a big, warm-hearted man, rarely without a
        cigar smoking away below his luxuriant mustache. Hans and Sophie
        were born in 1918 and 1921, and in those days Forchtenberg's
        only contact with the outside world was a yellow post-coach that
        connected it with the nearest railway station. The children
        loved it, but Robert had ambitions for his town. He managed to
        get the railway extended to Forchtenberg, and had a community
        sports center and a warehouse built. These improvements were not
        without their critics: Robert was far too progressive for some,
        and in 1930 he was voted out of office. The family moved first
        to Ludwigsburg and then to Ulm, where they settled. Robert, who
        had a tendency to live beyond his means, rented a large
        apartment for his family on the Cathedral Square. He set himself
        up as a business and tax consultant. </p>
      <p>The five children, Inge, Hans, Elisabeth, Sophie and Werner,
        were free to enjoy, as compensation for the loss of the
        countryside, the large palace park nearby. Hans, according to
        his brother-in-law, was more like his father -- impulsive,
        generous and extrovert. Sophie, no less strong a personality,
        had her mother's quiet sensitivity. What she shared with Hans
        was an absolute sense of human rights, something which all the
        children had inherited from their father, who exerted a strong
        but benign influence on them. Sophie also developed a mystical
        feeling for nature. She loved dancing. She was a good pianist
        and she could have become a professional artist - her drawings
        for Peter Pan, for example, glow with life; but when she went to
        university in Munich she opted to read the unusual combination
        of biology and philosophy. </p>
      <p>The happy family life did not end with Hitler's seizure of
        power. The arrival of National Socialism was the first impact of
        politics on the children's thought. Hans was fifteen, Sophie,
        twelve. </p>
      <p>Inge Aicher-Scholl was sixteen. She remembers that on 30
        January I933 the radio and the newspapers were full of the news,
        'Now everything will be better in Germany. Hitler is at the
        tiller." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard a great deal spoken about the
        Fatherland, of comradeship, the union of the Germanic people and
        love of the homeland. It impressed us, and we listened eagerly
        when such things were talked about on the streets or in
        school--for indeed we loved our homeland... And everywhere we
        heard that Hitler wanted to help the homeland back to greatness,
        happiness and security. He would see to it that everyone had a
        job to go to and enough to eat. He wouldn't rest until every
        single German enjoyed independence, freedom and happiness... </p>
      <p>The children were keen to join the Hitler Youth, and their
        parents, though they had given them a liberal upbringing, did
        not forbid it. But never for an instant had Robert been fooled
        by Hitler, and he said to them, 'Have you considered how he's
        going to manage it? He's expanding the armaments industry, and
        building barracks. Do you know where that's all going to end?'
        The children argued that Hitler had solved the problem of
        unemployment, and pointed to the new motorways being built
        throughout the land. Robert wondered aloud if material security
        would ever make happy a people which had been robbed of its
        right to free speech. </p>
      <p>At first his arguments fell on deaf ears. His children were
        enthusiastic members of the Hitler Youth and its female branch,
        the League of German Girls. They became group leaders. Only
        Sophie was a little less enthusiastic than the others. She was
        already worried by the fact that her Jewish schoolfriends could
        not join. She listened more attentively to her father's
        arguments. He and Hans, on the other hand, were barely on
        speaking terms some of the time. </p>
      <p>But then Hans attended the 1935 Party Rally at Nuremberg. He
        had been selected to carry the flag of Ulm--Standort at the
        Rally--a great honour. But he came back a changed man. He did
        not say much at first, but gradually new ideas emerged. The
        endless, senseless drilling, the hate-filled aggressive
        speeches, the stupid conversation, the vulgar jokes--a
        concentration of all this at Nuremberg had finally focused his
        mind on what Nazism really meant. </p>
      <p>There had been signs of Hans's disaffection before this. He was
        annoyed when he was told that the Hitler Youth was not
        interested in his collection of international
        folksongs--foreign, especially Russian, songs were strictly
        forbidden. And the special flag of his group was forbidden
        too--all groups were expected to carry a swastika banner. When
        finally his twelve-year-old standard bearer was threatened by a
        senior Hitler Youth official for refusing to give up the group
        flag, Hans hit the official. That was the end of the Hitler
        Youth for him. Soon afterwards he heard that a young
        schoolteacher had been picked up by a gang of SA and spat upon
        to order; the schoolteacher's crime was failure to join the
        Party. Gradually, news of the concentration camps seeped
        through. </p>
      <p>Sophie was quick to pick up his mood. The first cracks had
        appeared in the cement which bound their allegiance to Hitler.
        Hans began to show more of an interest in another kind of youth
        group--the dj.1.11,, so-called because it had been founded as
        Deutsche Jugend on 1 November I 929. The dj.1.11 was now
        illegal--all youth groups and organisations had been banned
        under the Nazis or amalgamated with the Hitler Youth--but it
        still existed underground. Its spirit was the open-minded,
        liberal, easy-going one of the Weimar Republic at its best. Its
        members would organise hitch-hiking expeditions as far as
        Finland and Sweden, or travel south to Calabria and Sicily. It
        represented cosmopolitanism, not nationalism. Its members did
        not wear uniforms or salute each other. They read 'illegal'
        books--works by George Bernard Shaw (who the Nazis thought was a
        Jew on account of his red hair), Stefan Zweig and Paul Claudel.
        It was for culture and against militarism, for the individual
        and not the mob. Sophie might have joined it too, but for the
        fact that it was open only to boys from age of twelve upwards.
        Nevertheless, she and her oldest sister Inge caught its mood. </p>
      <p>One day in late November 1937 there was a ring at the door of
        the Scholls' apartment and two men from the Gestapo stood there.
        The secret police had had the dj.1.11 group under observation
        for some time and now they were ready to pounce. The men said
        they were there to search the flat and arrest the children. With
        great presence of mind, Frau Scholl told them that they could do
        so by all means, but that, if the gentlemen would excuse her,
        she had to go to the baker's. The policemen didn't object--women
        in the Third Reich were consigned to three areas of life:
        church, kitchen and children. Even female Nazi leaders were
        never given much status or publicity by the regime. </p>
      <p>Frau Scholl left the flat and went up to the attic floor where
        Hans's and Werner's--the younger brother was also a determined
        anti-Nazi--bedrooms were to be found. Quickly she packed any
        potentially incriminating literature into a basket and took it
        round the corner to trusted friends. The Gestapo search turned
        nothing up, and the officials took Inge, Sophie and Werner--the
        three children who were at home at the time--away with them.
        Sophie was released almost immediately, but Inge and Werner were
        taken to Stutttgart and detained for a week, interrogated about
        what they might know of Ernst Niekisch and his Widerstand
        (Resistance) magazine, and about dj.1.11. They managed to play
        dumb, and were finally released. Hans, who had been arrested
        subsequently, was held for five weeks. Luckily for him he had
        been conscripted by then, and sympathetic commanding officer had
        him released, telling the Gestapo that as Hans was a soldier, he
        was in the Army's jurisdiction, not theirs. </p>
      <p>The Scholls--who were a well-known family in the smallish of
        Ulm--failed to stay out of trouble. Werner had taken an early
        decision to leave the Hitler Youth. It was a gesture of
        solidarity towards his friend Oti Aicher (who later married Inge
        Scholl), who had refused to join it and as a result was not
        allowed to take his final school examinations, thus cutting off
        any hope of university. Aicher later remembered how Werner had
        tied a swastika scarf round the eyes of the bust of Justice in
        front of the Ulm Law Courts. </p>
      <p>Werner was a keen photographer, and most of the surviving
        pictures of Sophie were taken by him. He died on the Russian
        Front, aged twenty-one. At a meeting of the League of German
        Girls to discuss suitable material for home reading, Sophie
        suggested Heinrich Heine, the brilliant nineteenth-century
        revolutionary German poet who was also a Jew. Replying to
        appalled objections at her suggestion, she said, 'The person who
        doesn't know Heine, doesn't know German literature.' Robert
        Scholl himself was later arrested and imprisoned briefly for
        anti-Nazi activities. </p>
      <p>The children read a great deal: Socrates, Aristotle, St.
        Augustine, Pascal; Maritain and Bernanos. The influence of these
        thinkers went deep, strengthening their resolve against the
        regime. The question was what to do, and how to do it?
        Meanwhile, for Sophie, school continued. She met Fritz
        Hartnagel, a career soldier four years her senior, and they went
        for tours in the country occasionally in his father's car,
        together with her older sister Elisabeth. For the innocent
        Sophie friendship with Hartnagel began to tum into something
        more. But it never quite became love. After the war Hartnagel
        married Elisabeth. They still live in Stuttgart, where before
        his retirement he was a judge. </p>
      <p>If she was moving away from Nazism through the late thirties,
        Sophie Scholl turned actively against it as a result of two
        experiences: Kiistallnacht, which she lived through in Ulm, and
        the outbreak of war on 1 September I939 -- She extracted a
        promise from each of her male friends that they would never fire
        their guns, but she was well aware of how unrealistic such a
        promise was. She wrote to Hartnagel with uncharacteristic
        bitterness: </p>
      <p>"You'll have your hands full from now on.&nbsp; I just can't
        accept that now people will be in peril of their lives because
        of other people.&nbsp; I can't accept it and I find it
        horrifying.&nbsp; Never tell me that it's for the sake of the
        Fatherland." </p>
      <p>Her subsequent letters express increasing disgust and anger at
        the war. 'I think I know you and that you're not much in favour
        of this war,' she wrote to him later. 'So how can you spend your
        time training people for it?' And in September I940 she wrote a
        letter of which Beck and Oster would have approved: </p>
      <p>"For me the relationship between a soldier&nbsp; and&nbsp;
        his&nbsp; people is&nbsp; roughly like that of a son who swears
        to stand by his father and his family through thick and
        thin.&nbsp; If it turns out that the father harms another family
        and then gets hurt as a consequence, must the son still stick by
        him? I can't accept it. Justice is more important than
        sentimental loyalty." </p>
      <p>Hartnagel himself remembers: </p>
      <p>"It was striking to see with what incisiveness and logic Sophie
        saw how things would develop, for she was warm-hearted and full
        of feeling, not cold and calculating. Here is an example: in
        winter 1941-42 there was a big propaganda campaign in Germany to
        get the people to give sweaters and other warm woolen clothing
        to the Army.&nbsp; German soldiers were at the gates of
        Leningrad and Moscow in the middle of a winter war for which
        they weren't prepared ... Sophie said, 'We're not giving
        anything.' I had just got back from the Russian Front ... I
        tried to describe to her how conditions were for the men, with
        no gloves, pullovers or warm socks. She stuck to her viewpoint
        relentlessly and justified it by saying, 'It doesn't matter if
        it's German soldiers who are freezing to death or Russians, the
        case is equally terrible.&nbsp; But we must lose the war.&nbsp;
        If we contribute warm clothes, we'll be extending it.'" </p>
      <p>After matriculation from school in 1940 she took a one-year
        course in kindergarten supervision, in the hope of avoiding
        State Work Duty - a kind of civil national service which all
        would-be students had to fulfill. But not only did the
        authorities refuse to accept the kindergarten training as a
        replacement for the State Duty, but with the acceleration of the
        war in 1941 they added to it State War Work. For another year,
        therefore, Sophie endured barrack life and manual labour before
        she could finally start her course at Munich University. She
        travelled there from Ulm early in May 1942. It was just before
        her twenty-first birthday--her last. </p>
      <p>Hans was at the station to meet her. He was reading medicine at
        the university - the semesters alternating with service at the
        Front. Through him she quickly gained an entree to university
        life. Among the first people she met was Professor Carl Muth,
        whose library Hans had been cataloguing. Muth was a pillar of
        the literary Resistance. His Roman Catholic magazine High Land
        had been banned finally in June 1941, having managed for eight
        years never once to mention Hitler's name. By now Hans had read
        the sermons of Bishop Galen. He had not given up his own ideas
        of making some kind of stand against the regime, and had become
        markedly politicised. From his writing it is clear that had he
        lived he would have chosen politics, not medicine, as his
        career. </p>
      <p>He was already at the centre of a group of young medical
        students -- Willi Graf, Christoph Probst and Alexander Schmorell
        -- who had decided to launch a leaflet campaign against the war,
        encouraging passive Resistance to the regime. They were joined
        by the popular philosophy lecturer Kurt Huber, who had already
        attracted the suspicion of the Nazis. He was considerably older
        than the others, but had no wish to lead the group. He guided
        his younger comrades' thoughts, and edited the last two of the
        six leaflets they produced. His lectures were always packed,
        because he managed to introduce veiled criticism of the regime
        into them. </p>
      <p>The group had no wish to throw bombs, or to cause any injury to
        human life. They wanted to influence people's minds against
        Nazism and militarism. Already a sympathetic architect had lent
        them his studio in a rear courtyard for their clandestine
        activities, and the relatively well-off Sclhmorell had been able
        to buy a typewriter and a duplicating machine. They called their
        group the 'White Rose'. Sophie was not brought into it
        initially, but she had a shrewd idea of what her brother was up
        to from early on. She would find books in his rooms -- which
        smelt of jasmine and cigarettes -- with significant passages
        marked. </p>
      <p>The choice of the name 'White Rose' is not easily explained.
        The rose as a symbol of secrecy might have occurred to them, and
        'white' might have reflected the fact that their leaflets were
        not inspired by any colour of political thought, but by broad
        humanism. It's also possible that the name was taken from B.
        Traven's eponymous novel, in which a Mexican farmer fights a
        tyrannical oil company. Whatever the reason the symbol is still
        a powerful one in Germany. </p>
      <p>The first four leaflets of the White Rose appeared in quick
        succession in June and July 1942. They were written jointly by
        Hans Scholl with Alexander Schmorell and Christoph Probst, who
        was the only married member of the group apart from Huber and
        who was already, at twenty-three, the father of two children (a
        third, whom he would never see, was born after his arrest). </p>
      <p>The first leaflet begins uncompromisingly: 'Nothing is less
        worthy of a cultivated people: than to allow itself to be
        governed by a clique of irresponsible bandits of dark ambition,
        without"Resistance.' The four issues, each covering two sides of
        the paper, draw on Goethe, Schiller and Aristotle, among others,
        to make their point, which is contained effectively in the
        sentence quoted. They refer to the murder of Jews in Poland,
        encourage the idea of sabotage in the armaments industry, and
        criticise the anti-Christian and anti-social nature of the war.
        'We are all guilty. We will not be silenced. We are your bad
        conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!' </p>
      <p>Sophie soon joined. Fear for the safety of her family was
        overridden by her desire to do something to fight Hitler. It was
        hard for them all: hard to swim against the current, and harder
        still to wish defeat upon their own country. Worst of all was
        the isolation in which they worked. </p>
      <p>Tirelessly the group distributed the leaflets by the
        suitcaseload throughout towns in southern Germany, either
        travelling with them (a very dangerous undertaking) and
        delivering them by hand at night, or using the mail. They were
        so successful that the movement spread, notably to Hamburg,
        where a branch of the White Rose was set up which survived its
        originator. </p>
      <p>The White Rose went into temporary abeyance during the summer
        of I942 as Hans, Willi and Alexander were ordered to the Russian
        Front, but they returned to Munich in October. The period had
        been of special significance to Schmorell. His mother, whom he
        had lost in infancy, was Russian. Meanwhile Sophie had spent the
        vacation working in an arms factory, and Robert Scholl had been
        in a Gestapo prison. </p>
      <p>Hans had seen the maltreatment of Jews and Russian prisoners at
        first hand. One day he gave his tobacco to an old man, and his
        iron rations to a girl. The girl had thrown the rations back at
        him, but he had picked them up, plucked a daisy, placed it on
        the pile of rations, and laid them at her feet. After a moment's
        hesitation, she had accepted them, and put the flower in her
        hair. </p>
      <p>The group returned from the Front more determined than ever to
        carry on the work of Resistance, and to make the White Rose into
        a permanent Resistance cell. Hans and Alexander even managed to
        arrange a meeting with Falk Harnack, the younger brother of
        Arvid Harnack of the Red Orchestra, with the intention of making
        contact with the main Resistance in Berlin, though death was to
        prevent this ever happening. In the meantime, postage and paper
        cost money. Fritz Hartnagel gave Sophie 1000 Reichsmark, for
        what she told him was 'a good purpose'. A generous source of
        support was the Stuttgart tax consultant Eugen Grimminger, who
        was married to a Jewess and had looked after Robert Scholl's
        business while he was in prison. A schoolfriend of Sophie
        remembers a meeting in Stuttgart in December 1942, when she told
        her, 'If I had a pistol and I were to meet Hitler here in the
        street, I'd shoot him down. If men can't manage it, then a woman
        should.' She replied, 'But then he'd be replaced by Himmler, and
        after Himmler, another.' Sophie retorted: 'One's got to do
        something to get rid of the guilt.' </p>
      <p>They bought a new, less noisy, duplicating machine. On trains,
        they took suitcases full of leaflets. If the police searched the
        train, they would leave the suitcase on the rack and hide in the
        lavatory, or spend the journey in another compartment. They
        became used to living on their nerves, but they never considered
        that they had a choice. Sophie and Hans took adjoining rooms in
        Franz-Josef-Strasse #13. In January 1943 a new White Rose
        leaflet appeared, this time written in a more popular style.
        Several thousand copies were made. Addresses were painstakingly
        copied out of telephone directories. The conspirators had to
        ensure that the Gestapo could not trace the source to Munich.
        Once again by train journeys, the group had to run the police
        gauntlet and post their leaflets from neighbouring towns. </p>
      <p>On 13 January, to mark the 470th anniversary of the university,
        the Nazi Gauleiter -- District Leader -- of the city, Paul
        Giesler, gave a speech in the course of which he told the female
        students that it would be better for them to get on with giving
        the Fuhrer a child than wasting time on books; he even offered
        to put his henchmen at their service. Several girls immediately
        left the hall in protest, only to be arrested at the exit. This
        led to a demonstration, in the course of which the Nazi Student
        Leader was dragged from the podium, beaten up, and declared a
        hostage against the release of the girls. The Nazis telephoned
        the police, who promptly arrived and broke up the meeting. This
        was the first student demonstration against the Nazis in Munich,
        and it stimulated the Gestapo to redouble its efforts to find
        the originators of the White Rose. </p>
      <p>Elisabeth Scholl spent a week at the end of January and the
        beginning of February with her brother and sister in Munich. She
        found a Russian blouse in a wardrobe and Sophie told her that
        Alexander liked to put it on when he went to visit the Russian
        forced-labourers in their barracks. Christoph Probst dropped in
        on his way between postings during a period of military duty
        and, though he only stopped for an hour and a half, Elisabeth
        was struck by the fact that he changed into civilian clothes. On
        3 February news of the defeat at Stalingrad (where Fritz
        Hartnagel was fighting) came through on the radio. One evening
        soon after, Alexander and Hans said they were going over to the
        Women's Hospital. Later on Willi Graf arrived and when Elisabeth
        told him where his friends were, he laughed and said they would
        hardly go there without him. All that evening Sophie was
        nervous, and kept talking about the need to write anti-Nazi
        graffiti on walls. 'You'd need to use something that was hard to
        get off,' she said, 'like bitumous paint.' </p>
      <p>The following morning Hans, Sophie and Elisabeth went to the
        university to attend a lecture by Huber on Leibniz. On a wall by
        the entrance the word 'Freedom' had been written in huge
        letters. 'What bastard did that?' snarled an older student. A
        large group of people were watching a handful of Russian women
        Tabourers trying to clean it off. 'They'll have a hard job,'
        said Sophie. 'That's bitumous paint.' Another friend, Traute
        Lafrenz, who was one of the leaders of the Hamburg White Rose,
        and now works as a doctor in Illinois, was in Munich too that
        day and saw Hans Scholl. 'I remember he was smiling to himself.
        Some outraged student or other came up to him and said, "Have
        you seen what's happened?" "No," said Hans. "What?" But his
        smile broadened. From that moment on I began to be terribly
        afraid for him.' </p>
      <p>The significance of the defeat at Stalingrad, in whatever light
        Goebbels presented it, could not be concealed from the German
        people, and the group around Hans Scholl realised that they
        should follow up with another leaflet immediately. This, the
        last from the White Rose, was quickly prepared and addressed to
        their 'Fellow Students'. It was more strongly and directly
        expressed than any of its predecessors. </p>
      <p>"The day of reckoning is come, the reckoning of German youth
        with the most appalling tyranny that our people has ever
        endured.&nbsp; In the name of the entire German people we demand
        from Adolf Hitler the return of our personal freedom, the most
        valuable possession of the Germans..." </p>
      <p>Hans and Sophie decided to distribute it in the university
        personally. </p>
      <p>On Thursday 18 February 1943 the weather was springlike -- They
        hurried to the university at 10 a.m. before the first morning
        lectures were over, carrying copies of the new leaflet in a
        small suitcase. They hurried to spread them wherever they could
        -- on windowsills, shelves, the tops of walls -- until their
        supply was almost exhausted. </p>
      <p>They had already left the main building when they decided to go
        back and get rid of the rest. They ran up the main staircase of
        the university's central hall and emptied the remaining contents
        of the case from a parapet into the courtyard. They were just in
        time. Immediately afterwards the doors of the lecture halls
        opened and students poured out. But the Scholls had been seen.
        The university's caretaker, Jakob Schmid, charged towards them
        as they raced back down the staircase, seized them each by the
        arm and bellowed, 'You're under arrest!' </p>
      <p>Both the young people stayed calm. They remained quiet and
        dignified as they were taken first to the bursar and then to the
        rector, SS Oberfuhrer Dr Walter Wrist, lecturer in Aryan
        language and culture. The doors of the university were sealed
        and all the students remaining inside had to assemble in the
        courtyard. Those who had picked up leaflets had to surrender
        them. The Scholls were taken to Gestapo Headquarters in
        handcuffs. Secret police went immediately to the rooms at
        Franz-Josef-Strasse, where they found several hundred new red
        8-pfennig stamps. Very soon afterwards, the Gestapo was on the
        trail of the rest of the group, though the Scholls betrayed no
        one. Christoph Probst was arrested the following day and the
        others soon after. </p>
      <p>The Scholls had known the risk that they were running. Sophie
        had even said shortly before: 'So many people have already died
        for this regime that it's time someone died against it.' There
        had been plenty of indications that the Gestapo investigation
        had been getting closer to them every day. They failed to
        receive a warning at the eleventh hour: the previous day, 17
        February, Otl Aicher, who had been wounded on active service,
        was staying with Carl Muth. He was in Munich with the intention
        of seeing Hans and Sophie, but before he could make contact he
        received an urgent coded message from Ulm by telephone, to the
        effect that Hans should be told personally that the 'book called
        Totalitanian State and Utopia was out of print'. He had rung
        Hans and told him that he had important news. They made a date
        for the following day--18 February -- at 11a.m. But when Aicher
        reached Franz-Josef-Strasse, it was too late. The Gestapo were
        already there, and he, too, was arrested--luckily to be released
        soon afterwards. </p>
      <p>Hans and Sophie were not tortured, but they were interrogated
        intensively for four days in Gestapo Headquarters at Wittelsbach
        Palace in Munich. Otl Aicher and Traute Lafrenz took the bad
        news to their parents, who tried to see if anything could be
        done to secure their release. It was in vain. Throughout their
        ordeal, the brother and sister, who each shared cells with one
        other political prisoner of their own sex, remained calm and
        fatalistic. Neither of them was broken by the experience. The
        trial was set for 22 February. Roland Freisler, Hitler's hanging
        judge, flew down from Berlin specially to preside. This was an
        indication of the importance the Nazi leadership considered the
        White Rose to have. The war was lost; the Allies were already
        bombing Munich; but protestors still had to be smashed. </p>
      <p>The hearing started at 9 a.m. and lasted until 1 p.m. It was a
        closed trial, and those without passes, including Hans's and
        Sophie's parents, were not admitted, though Robert was able to
        force an entrance briefly. The Scholls were tried together with
        Christoph Probst. None of them flinched under the sarcastic,
        hectoring onslaught of the judge. The verdict was a foregone
        conclusion: death by the guillotine. They were taken from the
        court to Stadelheim Prison immediately after judgement had been
        passed. </p>
      <p>By a miracle the parents had a last opportunity to see their
        children. They saw Hans first. Robert embraced him saying, 'You
        will go down in history. There is another justice than this.'
        Hans asked them to say farewell to his friends, and only when he
        mentioned one name very special to him did he weep, bowing his
        head so that no one should see. Sophie, when her turn came,
        accepted some little cakes that her brother had refused, saying,
        'Lovely. I didn't get anything to eat at lunchtime.' She looked
        wonderful, fresh and full of life. Her mother said, 'I'll never
        see you come through the door again.' 'Oh mother,' she answered,
        'after all, it's only a few years' more life I'll miss.' She was
        pleased and proud that they had betrayed no one, that they had
        taken all the responsibility on themselves. Her main concern was
        that her mother should be able to withstand the deaths of two
        children at the same time. But, for herself, she was completely
        composed. </p>
      <p>The parents left and returned to Ulm, thinking that something
        might still be done to help--at least to get the sentence
        commuted. But in the Nazi State, punishment normally followed
        sentence with terrifying speed. By 6 p.m. Sophie and Hans were
        dead. </p>
      <p>The following day, Inge Scholl was able to visit the flat in
        Franz-Josef-Strasse and there she found Sophie's diary, which
        had been overlooked by the Gestapo. Inge saw it as a gift from
        heaven. The family, in accordance with Nazi custom, was placed
        under arrest for being related to the malefactors. Kurt Huber,
        Willi Graf and Alexander Schmorell, who were arrested later,
        were sentenced to death on 19 April. </p>
      <p>Hans and Sophie were buried in Perlach Cemetery in south Munich
        on 24 February. In the town, graffiti appeared on walls: 'Their
        spirit lives.' </p>
