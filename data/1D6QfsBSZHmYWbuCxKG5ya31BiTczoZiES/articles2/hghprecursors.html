      ...I actually tried the Ultra Lab HGC, for a short time period of
      3 months. I had a back problem. It miraculously healed. It hurt
      like it had just been injured, and then healed. The same thing
      with my knees, which I had injured more than a decade before -
      they hurt like I had just injured them all over again and then
      healed. I have had zero problems with either since 2003, they were
      permanently and lastingly healed.<br>
      <br>
      I was worried about side effects from a product that powerful and
      stopped taking it, not realizing it would soon be gone. The
      benefits lasted until now (and are still lasting.) If you look on
      the web, the product that worked was "500 sub lingual pellets",
      the 126 tablet version you can actually find pictures of now was
      not as good, and now the product is entirely gone...<br>

      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The purpose of the present invention is to provide a
      growth-promoting preparation and a H-OL double-uplifting system to
      solve the above technical problems.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the above purpose, the present invention adopts the
      following technical solutions:<br>
      <br>
      A growth-promoting preparation and H-OL double-incends system is
      characterized in that the growth-promoting preparation is composed
      of zinc gluconate, alpinia, bio-calcium carbonate, L-lysine
      hydrochloride, and taurine, and each The weight ratio of the
      ingredients is 1:55:46:11:6. This growth-promoting preparation is
      combined with the application of the H-OL double-incendence system
      in promoting the growth of adolescents.<br>
      <br>
      The H-OL double-incendence system is an effective combination of
      the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system and the OL
      chondrocyte activation therapy after accurate detection of the
      cause, judging the increase potential, and differently increasing
      the development plan.<br>
      <br>
      The steps of the diagnosis and treatment of the H-OL double-incend
      system are as follows: using the X-ray method and the lateral
      position, if necessary, adding an oblique slice, to understand the
      growth and development status of the skeleton according to the
      conditions of the epiphyseal line, the epiphysis, and the
      skeleton; the epiphyseal line is close A black shadow of the
      femoral head. It belongs to a type of cartilage. After puberty
      begins to develop, it gradually begins to ossification. When it is
      completely ossified, people stop growing. The step of this
      examination is to select some sites to take X-rays, and then the
      professional doctor will measure according to the appearance of
      your bones. The pelvic pelvis will observe the skeletal osseous
      situation and determine the bone age. From the front to the back,
      the degree of ossification will be from low to high. From the
      anterior tibial superiorus to the posterior tibial superiorus and
      combined with the size of the epiphysis (whether the bilateral hip
      joints are normal, whether the size of the bilateral femoral head
      tibias is normal), the width of the epiphyseal line, and the
      degree of closure of the epiphyseal line, etc. Make evaluation
      conclusions! In the differential diagnosis should pay attention
      to: (1) the distal humerus see the fracture line, such as the
      fracture line in the metaphyseal end of the site should be
      supracondylar fracture; such as in the iliac lower growth plate
      and metaphysis Separation for the whole scorpion.<br>
      (2)<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the normal elbow shaft, the longitudinal axis of
      the proximal humerus can pass through the center of the radial
      head. Can be seen in the supracondylar fracture: metaphyseal
      imitation of the visible fracture line; full septum separation:
      the metaphysis see the "board sign" or "angle sign", the elbow
      visible ring swelling; (3) proximal humerus The longitudinal axis
      is not seen through the center of the radial head; the external
      skull of the cuboid is swollen, tender, and often touches the
      fracture block; elbow dislocation: the posterior elbow triangle
      disappears; (4) &lt;1 year old baby with small zygomatic bone The
      head has not yet appeared. The above method is not applicable. It
      is often misdiagnosed as dislocation of the elbow joint. This case
      is first considered as full separation.<br>
      <br>
      Through the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system,
      high-concentration nanometer series of traditional Chinese
      medicine prescriptions and the above-mentioned growth promoting
      preparations are used; the natural secretion of auxin is
      stimulated, pituitary cells are stimulated and repaired, and a
      large number of osteoblasts are continuously generated, thereby
      prolonging the length of long bones, and simultaneously enhancing
      the The uptake and use of important elements such as sodium,
      potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and sulfur promote the metabolism
      of the human body and allow the body to grow naturally.<br>
      <br>
      Through OL chondrocyte activation therapy, the motility of human
      osteoblasts, chondrocytes and tendon bursa cysts is stimulated to
      continuously divide and proliferate under the action of human
      growth hormone, accumulate in the space of long bones, and promote
      osteoarticular cartilage and osteophyte. Cartilage growth, long
      bone growth. And can further extend the growth cycle of iliac
      cartilage, postpone the closing time of the epiphyseal line, so as
      to achieve the purpose of efficient, rapid, sustained, stable and
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      The beneficial effects of the present invention: a
      growth-promoting preparation and a H-OL double-increased system,
      which adopts the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system, adopts
      a high-concentration nanometer-based traditional Chinese medicine
      prescription and the above-mentioned growth-promoting preparation,
      and stimulates the human body through OL chondrocyte activation
      therapy The activity of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and tendon
      bursa cells stimulates the natural secretion of auxin, stimulates
      and repairs the pituitary cells, and continues to produce a large
      number of osteoblasts, thereby prolonging the length of long
      bones. This therapy is mainly applied to males and females.
      Increased adolescence, increased adolescence, increased adulthood,
      precocious puberty, dwarfism, short stature, and stunted growth
      have a good therapeutic effect.<br>

      profitability of the production of meat foodstuffs, and in men -
      for the treatment of physiological or medical conditions
      characterized by a shortage of growth hormone in the secretion,
      e.g. low size of children having growth hormone deficiencies, and
      for the treatment of medical conditions which are improved from
      the anabolic effect of the growth hormone. The invention also
      relates to compositions for the stimulation of the release of
      growth hormones containing spiro compounds as active components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Growth hormone, which is secreted from the pituitary, stimulates
      growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing. In
      addition, growth hormone is known to have the following basic
      effects on the metabolic processes of the body:<br>
      1. Increased rate of protein synthesis in all cells of the body;<br>
      2. Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the
      body;<br>
      3. Increased mobilization of free fatty acids and use of fatty
      acids for energy.<br>
      <br>
      A deficiency in growth hormone secretion can result in various
      medical disorders, such as dwarfism.<br>
      <br>
      Various ways are known to release growth hormone. For example,
      chemicals such as arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA),
      glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as well
      as activities such as sleep and exercise, indirectly cause growth
      hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some
      fashion on the hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease
      somatostatin secretion or to increase the secretion of the known
      secretagogue growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) or an unknown
      endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone or all of these.<br>
      <br>
      In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were desired,
      the problem was generally solved by providing exogenous growth
      hormone or by administering GRF or a peptidal compound which
      stimulated growth hormone production and/or release. In either
      case the peptidyl nature of the compound necessitated that it be
      administered by injection. Initially the source of growth hormone
      was the extraction of the pituitary glands of cadavers. This
      resulted in a very expensive product and carded with it the risk
      that a disease associated with the source of the pituitary gland
      could be transmitted to the recipient of the growth hormone.
      Recently, recombinant growth hormone has become available which,
      while no longer carrying any risk of disease transmission, is
      still a very expensive product which must be given by injection or
      by a nasal spray.<br>
      <br>
      Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the release of
      endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl compounds
      related to GRF or the peptides of U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,890. These
      peptides, while considerably smaller than growth hormones are
      still susceptible to various proteases. As with most peptides,
      their potential for oral bioavailability is low. The instant
      compounds are non-peptide analogs for promoting the release of
      growth hormone which are stable in a variety of physiological
      environments and which may be administered parenterally, nasally
      or by the oral route.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The instant invention covers certain spiro compounds which have
      the ability to stimulate the release of natural or endogenous
      growth hormone. The compounds thus have the ability to be used to
      treat conditions which require the stimulation of growth hormone
      production or secretion such as in humans with a deficiency of
      natural growth hormone or in animals used for food production
      where the stimulation of growth hormone will result in a larger,
      more productive animal. Thus, it is an object of the instant
      invention to describe the spiro compounds. It is a further object
      of this invention to describe procedures for the preparation of
      such compounds. A still further object is to describe the use of
      such compounds to increase the secretion of growth hormone in
      humans and animals. A still further object of this invention is to
      describe compositions containing the spiro compounds for the use
      of treating humans and animals so as to increase the level of
      growth hormone secretions. Further objects will become apparent
      from a reading of the following description.<br>

      The compounds of the instant invention all have at least one
      asymmetric center as noted by the asterisk in the structural
      Formulas I and II above. Additional asymmetric centers may be
      present on the molecule depending upon the nature of the various
      substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will
      produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all such
      optical isomers, as separated, pure or partially purified optical
      isomers, racemic mixtures or diastereomeric mixtures thereof, be
      included within the ambit of the instant invention. In the case of
      the asymmetric center represented by the asterisk in Formula I and
      II, it has been found that the absolute stereochemistry of the
      more active and thus more preferred isomers are as shown in
      Formula Ia. With the R2 substituent as hydrogen, the special
      configuration of the asymmetric center corresponds to that in a
      D-amino acid. In most cases this is also designated an
      R-configuration although this will vary according to the values of
      R1 and R2 used in making R- or S stereochemical assignments.

      The instant compounds are generally isolated in the form of their
      pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, such as the salts
      derived from using inorganic and organic acids. Examples of such
      acids are hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, formic,
      acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, malonic,
      methane sulfonic and the like. In addition, certain compounds
      containing an acidic function such as a carboxy can be isolated in
      the form of their inorganic salt in which the counterion can be
      selected from sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and
      the like, as well as from organic bases.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of compounds I and II of the present invention can
      be carded out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes.
      Syntheses detailing the preparation of the compounds of Formula I
      and II in a sequential manner are presented in the following
      reaction schemes.<br>
      <br>
      The protected amino acid derivatives 1 are, in many cases,
      commercially available where the protecting group L is, for
      example, BOC or CBZ groups. Other protected amino acid derivatives
      1 can be prepared by literature methods. Many of the spiro
      piperidines and spiroazepines (n=2) of formula 2 and 2a are known
      in the literature and can be derivatized on the phenyl or
      heteroaryl by standard means, such as halogenation, nitration,
      sulfonylation, etc. Alternatively, various phenyl or heteroaryl
      substituted spiro piperidines and spiroazepines (n=2) can be
      prepared following literature methods using derivatized phenyl and
      heteraryl intermediates. In Schemes subsequent to Scheme I, the
      synthetic methods are illustrated only with spiropiperidines
      although it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
      the illustrated transformations can also be carried out in the
      higher homolog series to afford compounds of Formulas I and II
      with n=2.<br>
      <br>
      Intermediates of formulas 3 and 3a can be synthesized as described
      in Scheme 1. Coupling of spiro piperidines of formula 2 and 2a to
      protected amino acids of formula 1, wherein L is a suitable
      protecting group, is conveniently carded out in an inert solvent
      such as dichloromethane by a coupling reagent such as DCC or EDC
      in the presence of HOBT. Alternatively, the coupling can also be
      effected with a coupling reagent such as BOP in an inert solvent
      such as dichloromethane. Separation of unwanted side products, and
      purification of intermediates is achieved by chromatography on
      silica gel, employing flash chromatography (W. C. Still, M. Kahn,
      and A. Mitra J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2923), MPLC or preparative
      TLC. ##STR14##<br>
      <br>
      Conversion of 3 and 3a to intermediates 4 and 4a can be carried
      out as illustrated in Scheme 2. Removal of benzyloxycarbonyl
      groups can be achieved by a number of methods known in the art;
      for example, catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence
      of palladium or platinum catalyst in a protic solvent such as
      methanol. In cases where catalytic hydrogenation is
      contraindicated by the presence of other potentially reactive
      functionality, removal of benzyloxy carbonyl groups can also be
      achieved by treatment with a solution of hydrogen bromide in
      acetic acid. Removal of BOC protecting groups is carried out in a
      solvent such as methylene chloride or methanol, with a strong
      acid, such as hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid.
      Conditions required to remove other protecting groups which may be
      present can be found in Greene, T; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective
      Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New
      York, N.Y. 1991. ##STR15##<br>
      <br>
      Intermediates of formula 5 and 5b, wherein A is a methylene or a
      substituted methylene group, can be prepared as shown in Scheme 3
      by coupling of intermediates of formula 4 and 4a to amino acids of
      formula 6, once again, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane
      by a coupling reagent such as EDC or DCC in the presence of HOBT.
      These amino acids 6 are known amino acids or amino acids readily
      synthesized by methods known to those skilled in the art.
      Alternatively, the coupling can also be effected with a coupling
      reagent such as BOP in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.
      Also if R4 or R5 is a hydrogen then amino acids of formula 7 are
      employed in the coupling reaction, wherein L is a protecting group
      as defined above, to give 5a and 5c. Deprotection of 5a and 5c
      (L=protecting group) can be carried out under conditions known in
      the art. ##STR16##<br>
      <br>
      Compounds of formula I and II wherein R4 and/or R5 is a hydrogen
      can be further elaborated to new compounds I and II (preferred
      side chain R7 .dbd.CH2 --CH(OH)--CH2 X, wherein X.dbd.H or OH)
      which are substituted on the amino group as depicted in Scheme 4.
      Reductive amination of I and II with an aldehyde is carried out
      under conditions known in the art; for example, by catalytic
      hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of platinum,
      palladium, or nickel catalysts or with chemical reducing agents
      such as sodium cyanoborohydride in an inert solvent such as
      methanol or ethanol. Alternatively, a similar transformation can
      be accomplished via an epoxide opening reaction. ##STR17##<br>
      <br>
      Compounds of formula I and II, wherein A is N(R2)--(CH2)z
      --C(R7)(R7a)--(CH2)y, can be prepared as shown in Scheme 5 by
      reacting 4 or 4a with reagents 8, wherein X is a good leaving
      group such as Cl, Br, I, imidazole. Alternatively, 4 and 4a can be
      reacted with an isocyanate of formula 9 in an inert solvent such
      as 1,2-dichloroethane. If R4 or R5 is hydrogen in the final
      product, the reagents 8 and 9 will bear a removable protecting
      group L in place of R4 or R5. ##STR18##<br>
      <br>
      The compounds I and II of the present invention can also be
      prepared in a convergent manner as described in reaction schemes
      6, 7 and 8.<br>
      <br>
      The protected amino acid derivatives 10 are, in many cases,
      commercially available where M=methyl, ethyl, or benzyl esters.
      Other ester protected amino acids can be prepared by classical
      methods familiar to those skilled in the art. Some of these
      methods include the reaction of a protected amino acid with a
      diazoalkane and removal of a protecting group L, the reaction of
      an amino acid with an appropriate alcohol in the presence a strong
      acid like hydrochloric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Synthetic
      routes for the preparation of new amino acids are described in
      Schemes 14, 15, and 16.<br>
      <br>
      Intermediates of formula 11 and 11a, can be prepared as shown in
      Scheme 6 by coupling of amines 10 to amino acids 6 and/or 7,
      wherein L is a protecting group, as described above in Scheme 3.
      When a urea linkage is present in 11 or 11a, it can be introduced
      as illustrated in Scheme 5. ##STR19##<br>
      <br>
      Conversion of the ester 11 or 11a to intermediate acids 12 or 12a
      can be achieved by a number of methods known in the art as
      described in Scheme 7; for example, methyl and ethyl esters can be
      hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide in a protic solvent like aqueous
      methanol. In addition, removal of benzyl group can be accomplished
      by a number of reductive methods including hydrogenation in the
      presence of platinum or palladium catalyst in a protic solvent
      such as methanol. An allyl ester can be cleaved with
      tetrakis-triphenylphosphine palladium catalyst in the presence of
      2-ethylhexanoic acid in a variety of solvents including ethyl
      acetate and dichloromethane (see J. Org. Chem. 1982, 42, 587).
      ##STR20##<br>
      <br>
      Acid 12 or 12a can then be elaborated to 5 &amp; 5a and 5b &amp;
      5c as described in Scheme 8. Coupling of spiro piperidines of
      formula 2 and 2a to acids of formula 12 or 12a, wherein L is a
      suitable protecting group, is conveniently carried out in an inert
      solvent such as dichloromethane by a coupling reagent such as
      dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) or EDC in the presence of
      1-hydroxybenztriazole (HOBT). Alternatively, the coupling can also
      be effected with a coupling reagent such as
      benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium
      hexafluorophosphate ("BOP") in an inert solvent such as
      dichloromethane. Transformation of 5a &amp; 5c to I and II is
      achieved by removal of the protecting group L. When R4 and/or R5
      is H, substituted alkyl groups may be optionally added to the
      nitrogen atom as described in Scheme 4. ##STR21##<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of oxygenated spiroindanyl piperidine
      intermediates is illustrated in scheme 9 in which R3a and R3b are
      both hydrogens. Hydroboration of the protected spiroindene 13
      followed by oxidative workup with pyridinium chlorochromate
      provides the spiroindanone 14. ##STR22##<br>
      <br>
      Conversion of spiroindanes into benzolactam intermediates is
      illustrated in Scheme 10. The treatment of the spiroindanone with
      hydrazoic acid in an inert solvent such as chloroform (Schmidt
      reaction) is one of the many suitable literature methods for this
      transformation. A mixture of two benzolactams is formed in this
      example. The isomers are easily separated by chromatography on
      silica gel. These intermediates can then be deprotected and
      incorporated into growth hormone secretagogues as depicted in
      Schemes 1 and 8 utilizing generic intermediate 2. ##STR23##<br>
      <br>
      Alkylation of 15 and 16 with an alkyl halide in a solvent such as
      DMF in the presence of NaH afford 17 and 18 (R2 .dbd.C1 -C4
      alkyl). ##STR24##<br>
      <br>
      When L is an appropriate protecting group such as a benzyl group
      the amides can be reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to provide
      the amines 19 and 21. These amines where R2 .dbd.H can then be
      alkylated, arylated, acylated, or reacted with substituted
      sulfonyl halides or isocyanates employing conditions known to
      those skilled in the art to afford compounds 20 and 22. Removal of
      the protecting group (L) by hydrogenolysis using a palladium
      catalyst provides intermediates that can be incorporated into the
      secretagogues of this invention using the chemistry illustrated in
      Schemes 1 and 8 shown above which utilize generic intermediate 2.
      ##STR25##<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the
      1,2,3,4-tetrahydrospiro[isoquinolin-4,4'-piperidine] ring system
      can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 12. The ozonolysis of the
      protected spiroindene followed by dimethyl sulfide treatment gives
      a hemiacetal intermediate 24 which under reductive amination and
      acylation conditions provides amine 25. The amino protecting group
      (L) has been defined above. ##STR26##<br>
      <br>
      The ring analogs of formula 26, where X, Y is H,H; OH,H; H,OH; and
      .dbd.O may be prepared by methods described in the literature and
      known to those skilled in the art. For example, as illustrated in
      Scheme 13, the spiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4'-piperidine] analog can
      be prepared from a substituted or unsubstituted
      2-hydroxyacetophenone and a properly protected 4-piperidone as
      described by Kabbe, H. J. Synthesis 1978, 886-887 and references
      cited therein. The 2-hydroxyacetophenones, in turn, are either
      commercially available or can be prepared by routes in the
      literature known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are
      described by Chang, C. T. et al, in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1961,
      3414-3417. and by Elliott, J. M. et al, in J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35,
      3973-3976. Removal of the protecting group as described in:
      Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., Wuts, P.
      G., John Wiley &amp; sons, New York, 1991, and Olofson, R. A. et
      al, J. Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 2081-2082, provides the amine which
      then can be incorporated into a growth hormone secretagogue via
      the chemistry detailed in Schemes 1 and 8 shown above which
      utilize generic intermediate 2. ##STR27##<br>
      <br>
      The ketone functionality in compounds of general structure 27 may
      be reduced to an alcohol using sodium borohydride or may be fully
      reduced to a methylene also employing conditions known to those
      skilled in the art. For example, reduction of the ketone with
      sodium borohydride, followed by treatment with concentrated
      hydrochloric acid and hydrogenation yield compounds with general
      structure 29. The amine of structure 27, 28, or 29 can then be
      incorporated into a growth hormone secretagogue via the chemistry
      detailed in Schemes 1 and 8 utilizing generic formula 2.
      Alternatively, the ketone can often be reduced after incorporation
      into the compounds of Formula I.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of chiral
      hydroxyspiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4'-piperidine] analogs can be
      achieved using optically active reducing agents and the
      crystallization of diastereomeric salts.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of formulas I and II of the present invention are
      prepared from a variety of substituted natural and unnatural amino
      acids such as those of formulas 30 and 6 and 7 where A is --(CH2)x
      --C(R7)(R7a)--(CH2)y --. The preparation of many of these acids
      has been described in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,237.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of these intermediates in racemic form is
      accomplished by classical methods familiar to those skilled in the
      art (Williams, R. M. "Synthesis of Optically Active .alpha.-Amino
      Acids" Pergamon Press: Oxford, 1989; Vol. 7). Several methods
      exist to resolve (DL)-amino acids. ##STR28## One of the common
      methods is to resolve amino or carboxyl protected intermediates by
      crystallization of salts derived from optically active acids or
      amines. Alternatively, the amino group of carboxyl protected
      intermediates can be coupled to optically active acids by using
      chemistry described earlier. Separation of the individual
      diastereomers either by chromatographic techniques or by
      crystallization followed by hydrolysis of the chiral amide
      furnishes resolved amino acids. Similarly, amino protected
      intermediates can be converted to a mixture of chiral
      diastereomeric esters and amides. Separation of the mixture using
      methods described above and hydrolysis of the individual
      diastereomers provides (D) and (L) amino acids. Finally, an
      enzymatic method to resolve N-acetyl derivatives of (DL)-amino
      acids has been reported by Whitesides and coworkers in J. Am.
      Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 6354-6364.<br>
      <br>
      When it is desirable to synthesize these intermediates in
      optically pure form, some established methods include: (1)
      asymmetric electrophilic amination of chiral enolates (J. Am.
      Chem. Soc. 1986, 108, 6394-6395, 6395-6397, and 6397-6399), (2)
      asymmetric nucleophilic amination of optically active carbonyl
      derivatives, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 1906; Tetrahedron Lett.
      1987, 28, 32), (3) diastereoselective alkylation of chiral glycine
      enolate synthons (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9276; J. Org. Chem.
      1989, 54, 3916), (4) diastereoselective nucleophilic addition to a
      chiral electrophilic glycinate synthon (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986,

      For example, alkylation of the enolate of diphenyloxazinone 31 (J.
      Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9276) with cinnamyl bromide in the
      presence of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide proceeds smoothly to
      afford 32 which is converted into the desired
      (D)-2-amino-5-phenylpentanoic acid 33 by removing the
      N-t-butyloxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid and
      hydrogenation over a PdCl2 catalyst (Scheme 14) ##STR29##<br>

      Intermediates of formula 30 which are O-benzyl-(D)-serine
      derivatives 34 are conveniently prepared from suitably substituted
      benzyl halides and N-protected-(D)-serine 34. The protecting group
      L is conveniently a BOC or a CBZ group. Benzylation of 34 can be
      achieved by a number of methods well known in the literature
      including deprotonation with two equivalents of sodium hydride in
      an inert solvent such as DMF followed by treatment with one
      equivalent of a variety of benzyl halides (Synthesis 1989, 36) as
      shown in Scheme 15. ##STR30##<br>
      <br>
      The O-alkyl-(D)-serine derivatives are also prepared using the
      alkylation protocol shown in Scheme 15. Other methods that could
      be utilized to prepare (D)-serine derivatives of formula 35
      include the acid catalyzed benzylation of carboxyl protected
      intermediates derived from 34 with reagents of formula ArCH2
      OC(.dbd.NH)CCl3 (O. Yonemitsu et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1988, 36,
      4244). Alternatively, alkylation of the chiral gylcine enolates
      (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9276; J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 3916)
      with ArCH2 OCH2 X where X is a leaving group affords 35. In
      addition D,L--O-aryl(alkyl)serines can be prepared and resolved by
      methods described above.<br>
      <br>
      The alkylation of N-protected-(D)-cysteine 36 is carried out by
      the procedure described in the (D)-serine derivative synthesis and
      illustrated below with R1a --X where X is a leaving group such as
      halides and mesyloxy groups as shown in Scheme 16. ##STR31##<br>
      <br>
      The oxidation of the cysteine derivatives 37 to the sulfoxide 38
      (n=1) and the sulfone 38 (n=2) can be accomplished with many
      oxidizing agents. (For a review of the oxidation of sulfides see
      Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 1982, 14, 45.) Sodium periodate (J. Org.
      Chem. 1967, 32, 3191) is often used for the synthesis of
      sulfoxides and potassium hydrogen persulfate (OXONE) (Tetrahedron
      Lett. 1981, 22, 1287) is used for the synthesis of sulfones.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, a variety of substituted amino acids may be incorporated
      into a growth hormone secretagogue via the chemistry detailed in
      Schemes 1 and 8. The secretagogues that contain a sulfoxide or a
      sulfone functional group can also be prepared from the cysteine
      secretagogues by using sodium periodate or OXONE.RTM..
      Alternatively hydrogen peroxide may be used as the oxidizing
      reagent in the last step of the synthesis as shown in Scheme 17.
      The sulfoxide 40 (n=1) and sulfone 40 (n=2) analogs can be
      separated by preparative thin layer chromatography. ##STR32##
      Removal of amino protecting groups can be achieved by a number of
      methods known in the art; as described above and in Protective
      Groups in Organic Synthesis T. W. Greene, John Wiley and Sons, New
      York. 1981.<br>
      <br>
      Compounds of formula I wherein R@4 and R@5 are each hydrogen can
      be further elaborated by reductive alkylation with an aldehyde by
      the aforementioned procedures or by alkylations such as by
      reaction with various epoxides. The products, obtained as
      hydrochloride or trifluoroacetate salts, are conveniently purified
      by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatogrphy (HPLC) or
      by recrystallization.<br>

      The spiro piperidines of formula 41 can be prepared by a number of
      methods, including the syntheses as described below. ##STR33##<br>
      <br>
      The spiropiperidines of formula 42, wherein L is a defined
      protecting group, can be synthesized by methods that are known in
      the literature (for example H. Ong et al J. Med. Chem. 1983, 23,
      981-986). The indoline nitrogen of 42, wherein L is a protecting
      group such as methyl or benzyl, can be reacted by with a variety
      of electrophiles to yield spiro piperidines of formula 43, wherein
      R9 can be a variety of functionalities. Compound 42 can be reacted
      with, for example, isocyanates in an inert solvent like
      dichloromethane to yield urea derivatives, chloroformates in an
      inert solvent like dichloromethane to yield carbamates, acid
      chlorides, ##STR34## anhydrides, or acyl imidazoles to generate
      amides, sulfonyl chlorides to generate sulfonamides, sulfamyl
      chlorides to yield sulfamides. Also, the indoline nitrogen of 42
      can be reductively alkylated with aldehydes with conditions known
      in the art. When the aldehyde used in the reductive amination
      reaction is a protected glyoxylic acid of structure HCOCOOM,
      wherein M is a defined protecting group, M can be removed from the
      product and further derivatized. Alternatively, 42 can be reacted
      with epoxides to produce 43, wherein R9 is
      .beta.-hydroxy-substituted alkyl or arylalkyl groups. The indoline
      42 can also be transformed to compounds of formula 43, wherein R9
      =phenyl or substituted phenyl, heteroaryl or substituted
      heteroaryl, by carrying out the reacting 42 with a fluoro phenyl
      or fluoro heteroaryl reagent. This chemistry is detailed in H. Ong
      et al J. Med. Chem. 1983, 23, 981-986. ##STR35##<br>
      <br>
      The spiro piperidine intermediate 43 (L=Me or Bn), wherein R9 is
      hydrogen or most of the derivatives described above, can be
      demethylated or debenzylated to produce 44, wherein R9 is hydrogen
      or most of the derivatives described above, as shown in Scheme 19.
      For compounds of formula 43, wherein L=Me, demethylation can be
      carried out by a number methods familiar those skilled in the art.
      For example, demethylation of 43 be accomplished by reacting it
      with cyanogen bromide and potassium carbonate in an inert solvent
      solvent such as dichloromethane to yield a cyanamide which can
      reduced to give 44 by treatment with lithium aluminum hydride in
      refluxing tetrahydrofuran, refluxing strong acid like aqueous
      hydrochloric acid, or with Grignard reagents like methyl magnesium
      bromide. Alternatively, demethylation of 43 can be effected with
      the ACE-Cl method as described in R. Olofson et al. J. Org. Chem.
      1984, 49, 2795 and references therein. For intermediates of
      formula 43, wherein L=Bn, removal of benzyl group can be
      accomplished by reductive methods including hydrogenation in the
      presence of platinum or palladium catalyst in a protic solvent
      like methanol. Alternatively, debenzylation of 43, L=Bn, can be
      effected with the ACE-Cl method as described in R. Olofson et al.
      J. Org. Chem. 1984.<br>

      The spiro heterocyclic compounds 45 can be prepared by a number of
      methods, including the syntheses as described in Scheme 20.
      ##STR36## Allylic oxidation of the protected piperidine 47 is
      accomplished by classical methods familiar to those skilled in the
      art (Rabjohn, N. Org. React. 1976, 24, 261). The resulting allylic
      alcohol is treated with thionyl chloride in an inert solvent such
      as benzene to provide the corresponding chloride 48. When D.dbd.O
      or S, the alkylation is carried out in DMF or acetone as solvent
      with potassium carbonate as a base, and when D.dbd.NR9 (R9 .dbd.H,
      alkyl, aryl, acyl, sulfonyl, carbamate) the reaction is carried
      out with sodium hydride as a base in an inert solvent such as THF
      to afford the cyclization precursor 49. When L is a defined
      protecting group, compound 49 can be cyclized by a number methods
      familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, cyclization of
      49 can be accomplished by reaction with tributyltin hydride
      (Curran, D. P. Synthesis 1988, 417 and 489) in an inert solvent
      such as benzene to yield 46. Alternatively, compound 46
      (D.dbd.NR9) can be prepared by the method shown in Schemes 18 and
      19. When D.dbd.S, compound 46 can be oxidized to the sulfoxide 47
      (n=1) and the sulfone 47 (n=2) by many oxidizing agents (Scheme
      21). For example, sodium periodate is often used for the synthesis
      of sulfoxides and OXONE is used for the synthesis of sulfones.
      Removal of the protecting group provides the amine 45 which then
      can be incorporated into a growth hormone secretagogue via the
      chemistry detailed in Scheme 1 and 8 shown above which utilize
      generic intermediate 2. ##STR37##<br>
      <br>
      The spiro piperidines of formula 50 and formula 51 can be prepared
      by the syntheses described in Scheme 22.<br>
      <br>
      The phthalimidines of formula 53, where R11 is defined as alkyl,
      aryl, (CH2)q -aryl, or a protecting group, are either commercially
      available or can be synthesized from the corresponding
      phthalimides by methods that are known in the literature ( for
      example, Bewster et al in J. Org. Chem., 1963, 28, 501; Mcalees et
      al J. Chem. Soc., 1977, 2038). The phthalimidine 53 can be
      alkylated in the presence of a base, such as potassium hydride,
      lithium or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, with the protected
      bis 2-haloethyl amine, where L is a defined protecting group such
      as methyl, benzyl, t-BOC, or CBZ, etc., and Y could be Cl, Br, I,
      to yield the spiropiperidine 54. The protecting group could be
      removed by procedures described above to yield formula 50.
      Reduction of the lactam in formula 50 by hydrides, such as lithium
      aluminum hydride, yields formula 51. ##STR38##<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction
      schemes is not significant and it is within the skill of one
      skilled in the art to vary the order of reactions to facilitate
      the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products.<br>
      <br>
      The growth hormone releasing compounds of Formula I and II are
      useful in vitro as unique tools for understanding how growth
      hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level. This
      includes use in the evaluation of many factors thought or known to
      influence growth hormone secretion such as age, sex, nutritional
      factors, glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, as well as fasting and
      non-fasting states. In addition, the compounds of this invention
      can be used in the evaluation of how other hormones modify growth
      hormone releasing activity. For example, it has already been
      established that somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release.
      Other hormones that are important and in need of study as to their
      effect on growth hormone release include the gonadal hormones,
      e.g., testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone; the adrenal
      hormones, e.g., cortisol and other corticoids, epinephrine and
      norepinephrine; the pancreatic and gastrointestinal hormones,
      e.g., insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin; the vasoactive
      peptides, e.g., bombesin, the neurokinins; and the thyroid
      hormones, e.g., thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The compounds of
      Formulas I and II can also be employed to investigate the possible
      negative or positive feedback effects of some of the pituitary
      hormones, e.g., growth hormone and endorphin peptides, on the
      pituitary to modify growth hormone release. Of particular
      scientific importance is the use of these compounds to elucidate
      the subcellular mechanisms mediating the release of growth
      hormone.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of Formula I and II can be administered to animals,
      including man, to release growth hormone in vivo. For example, the
      compounds can be administered to commercially important animals
      such as swine, cattle, sheep and the like to accelerate and
      increase their rate and extent of growth, to improve feed
      efficiency and to increase milk production in such animals. In
      addition, these compounds can be administered to humans in vivo as
      a diagnostic tool to directly determine whether the pituitary is
      capable of releasing growth hormone. For example, the compounds of
      Formula I and II can be administered in vivo to children. Serum
      samples taken before and after such administration can be assayed
      for growth hormone. Comparison of the amounts of growth hormone in
      each of these samples would be a means for directly determining
      the ability of the patient's pituitary to release growth hormone.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention includes within its scope
      pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient,
      at least one of the compounds of Formula I and II in association
      with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Optionally, the active
      ingredient of the pharmaceutical compositions can comprise an
      anabolic agent in addition to at least one of the compounds of
      Formula I and II or another composition which exhibits a different
      activity, e.g., an antibiotic growth permittant or an agent to
      treat osteoporosis or in combination with a corticosteroid to
      minimize the catabolic side effects or with other pharmaceutically
      active materials wherein the combination enhances efficacy and
      minimizes side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Growth promoting and anabolic agents include, but are not limited
      to, TRH, diethylstilbesterol, estrogens, .beta.-agonists,
      theophylline, anabolic steroids, enkephalins, E series
      prostaglandins, compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,239,345,
      e.g., zeranol, and compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,979,
      e.g., sulbenox or peptides disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,890.<br>
      <br>
      A still further use of the growth hormone secretagogues of this
      invention is in combination with other growth hormone
      secretagogues such as the growth hormone releasing peptides
      GHRP-6, GHRP-1 as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,890 and
      publications WO 89/07110, WO 89/07111 and B-HT920 as well as
      hexarelin and the newly discovered GHRP-2 as described in WO
      93/04081 or growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH, also
      designated GRF) and its analogs or growth hormone and its analogs
      or somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2 or .alpha.-adrenergic
      aginists such as clonidine or serotonin 5HTID agonists such as
      sumitriptan or agents which inhibit somatostatin or its release
      such as physostigmine and pyridostigmine.<br>
      <br>
      As is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and
      potential uses of growth hormone are varied and multitudinous.
      Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for
      purposes of stimulating the release of endogenous growth hormone
      can have the same effects or uses as growth hormone itself. These
      varied uses of growth hormone may be summarized as follows:
      stimulating growth hormone release in elderly humans; treating
      growth hormone deficient adults; prevention of catabolic side
      effects of glucocorticoids, treatment of osteoporosis, stimulation
      of the immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating
      bone fracture repair, treatment of growth retardation, treating
      acute or chronic renal failure or insufficiency, treatment of
      physiological short stature, including growth hormone deficient
      children, treating short stature associated with chronic illness,
      treatment of obesity and growth retardation associated with
      obesity, treating growth retardation associated with Prader-Willi
      syndrome and Turner's syndrome; accelerating the recovery and
      reducing hospitalization of burn patients or following major
      surgery such as gastrointestinal surgery; treatment of
      intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia,
      hypercortisonism and Cushings syndrome; replacement of growth
      hormone in stressed patients; treatment of osteochondrodysplasias,
      Noonans syndrome, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, delayed
      wound healing, and psychosocial deprivation; treatment of
      pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency; attenuation of
      protein catabolic response after a major operation; treating
      malabsorption syndromes, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to
      chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; accelerating weight gain
      and protein accretion in patients on TPN (total parenteral
      nutrition); treatment of hyperinsulinemia including
      nesidioblastosis; adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction and
      to prevent and treat gastric and duodenal ulcers; to stimulate
      thymic development and prevent the age-related decline of thymic
      function; adjunctive therapy for patients on chronic hemodialysis;
      treatment of immunosuppressed patients and to enhance antibody
      response following vaccination; improvement in muscle strength,
      mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis,
      renal hemeostasis in the frail elderly; stimulation of
      osteoblasts, bone remodelling, and cartilage growth; treatment of
      neurological diseases such as peripheral and drug induced
      neuropathy, Guillian-Barre Syndrome, amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and
      demyelinating diseases; stimulation of the immune system in
      companion animals and treatment of disorders of aging in companion
      animals; growth promotant in livestock; and stimulation of wool
      growth in sheep.<br>
      <br>
      It will be known to those skilled in the art that there are
      numerous compounds now being used in an effort to treat the
      diseases or therapeutic indications enumerated above. Combinations
      of these therapeutic agents some of which have also been mentioned
      above with the growth hormone secretagogues of this invention will
      bring additional, complementary, and often synergistic properties
      to enhance the growth promotant, anabolic and desirable properties
      of these various therapeutic agents. In these combinations, the
      therapeutic agents and the growth hormone secretagogues of this
      invention may be independently present in dose ranges from one
      one-hundredth to one times the dose levels which are effective
      when these compounds and secretagogues are used singly.<br>
      <br>
      Combined therapy to inhibit bone resorption, prevent osteoporosis
      and enhance the healing of bone fractures can be illustrated by
      combinations of bisphosphonates and the growth hormone
      secretagogues of this invention. The use of bisphosphonates for
      these utilities has been reviewed, for example, by Hamdy, N. A.
      T., Role of Bisphosphonates in Metabolic Bone Diseases. Trends in
      Endocrinol. Metab., 1993, 4, 19-25. Bisphosphonates with these
      utilities include alendronate, tiludronate, dimethyl--APD,
      risedronate, etidronate, YM-175, clodronate, pamidronate, and
      BM-210995. According to their potency, oral daily dosage levels of
      the bisphosphonate of between 0.1 mg and 5 g and daily dosage
      levels of the growth hormone secretagogues of this invention of
      between 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight are administered to
      patients to obtain effective treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of this invention can be administered by oral,
      parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or
      subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal,
      sublingual, or topical routes of administration and can be
      formulated in dosage forms appropriate for each route of
      administration.<br>
      <br>
      Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules,
      tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms,
      the active compound is admixed with at least one inert
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or
      starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal
      practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g.,
      lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of
      capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise
      buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared
      with enteric coatings.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include
      pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions,
      syrups, the elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the
      art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can
      also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and
      suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      Preparations according to this invention for parenteral
      administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions,
      suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or
      vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable
      oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable
      organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also
      contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and
      dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example,
      filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating
      sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the
      compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be
      manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can
      be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable
      medium immediately before use.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably
      suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active
      substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also
      prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this
      invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount
      of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is
      obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic
      effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the
      treatment. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.0001 to 100
      mg/kg. of body weight daily are administered to patients and
      animals, e.g., mammals, to obtain effective release of growth
      hormone.<br>
