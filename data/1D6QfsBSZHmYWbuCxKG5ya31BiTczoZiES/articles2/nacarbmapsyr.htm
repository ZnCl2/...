        I had always wondered, since most people's health problems are
        partly owing to being too acidic, if it would be a good idea to
        take baking soda, since it is so alkaline. Well, it turns out
        that there is a story to that, whereby simple baking soda and
        maple syrup cooked gently together were said to stop and even
        heal cancer. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">“<em>There is not a tumor on God’s
            green earth that cannot be licked with a little baking soda
            and maple syrup</em>.” That is the astonishing claim of
          controversial folk healer Jim Kelmun who says that this simple
          home remedy can stop and reverse the deadly growth of cancers.
          His loyal patients swear by the man they fondly call Dr. Jim
          and say he is a miracle worker. “Dr. Jim cured me of lung
          cancer,” said farmer Ian Roadhouse. “Those other doctors told
          me that I was a goner and had less then six months to live.
          But the doc put me on his mixture and in a couple of months
          the cancer was gone. It did not even show up on the x-rays.” </span><br>
        <br>
        Dr. Jim discovered this treatment accidentally somewhere in the
        middle of the last century when he was treating a family plagued
        by breast cancer. There were five sisters in the family and four
        of them had died of breast cancer. He asked the remaining sister
        if there was anything different in her diet and she told him
        that she was partial to sipping maple syrup and baking soda. <br>
        <br>
        Since then, reported by a newspaper in Ashville, North Carolina,
        Dr. Jim dispensed this remedy to over 200 people diagnosed with
        terminal cancer and amazingly he claims of that number 185 lived
        at least 15 more years and nearly half enjoyed a complete
        remission of their disease.<span lang="EN-US"> When combined
          with other safe and effective treatments like transdermal
          magnesium therapy, iodine, vitamin C, probiotics and other
          items like plenty of good sun exposure, pure water and clay
          treatments we should expect even higher remission rates.</span>
        <br>
        <span lang="EN-US"></span><br>
        <span lang="EN-US">It is important not to use baking soda which
          has had aluminum added to it. The Cancer Tutor site reports
          that Arm and Hammer does have aluminum but the company insists
          that is not true. One can buy a product which specifically
          states it does not include aluminum or other chemicals. (e.g.
          Bob's Red Mill, Aluminum-Free, Baking Soda). Sodium
          bicarbonate is safe and extremely inexpensive. </span><br>
        <span lang="EN-US">Some people believe that this works because
          the cancer cells love sugar and gobble up the maple syrup, and
          in the process give a free ride for the </span>baking soda
        right into the cancer cell. The baking soda is like <span
          lang="EN-US"> cyanide to cancer cells, for it hits the cancer
          cells with a shock wave of alkalinity, which allows much more
          oxygen into the cancer cells than they can tolerate. Cancer
          cells cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen.
        </span><br>
        <br>
        My husband and I take a teaspoon of this daily, every now and
        again. The key to heating it is to put it on a super, super low
        temperature. Once the maple syrup is burned, it tastes TERRIBLE.
        But if you keep it just warm enough to fizz and mix for five
        minutes, so the two substances get combined, then it tastes
        quite pleasant. This sure can't hurt. 100% pure maple syrup is
        also very good for you <br>
        The nice thing about this remedy, is that you can do it at the
        same time as anything else you are doing. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE </span><br>
        <br>
        Mix 3 parts organic maple syrup with 1 part Aluminum free baking
        soda ( Red Mill Brand) stir with low heat (not over 120 degrees)
        for 5-10 minutes and take 3 tsp per day for 1 to 2 months. If it
        tastes terrible, you burned it, which is easy to do. Change diet
        to no meat and especially no sugar!! and no white flour.&nbsp; <br>

        Tonight we are going back to medical basics with the application
        of the least expensive, safest and perhaps mosteffective cancer
        medicine there is. Sodium bicarbonate has been on many cancer
        patients’ minds this past year. It has not been easy though to
        get to Rome or even contact Dr. Tullio Simoncini for treatment.
        And doctors willing to give bicarbonate IVs are not on every
        corner so it’s been somewhat frustrating to have something so
        simple and effective remain elusive. If doctors doing such
        treatments want to be listed by the IMVA for referral please
        contact us. <br>
        <br>
        Though we have known that oral intake of sodium bicarbonate will
        have the "Simoncini” effect on oral, esophagus and stomach
        cancer we have not focused at all on the systemic effect of
        bicarbonate taken orally. Every cancer patient and every health
        care practitioner should know that oral intake of sodium
        bicarbonate offers an instant and strong shift of blood pH into
        the alkaline. So strong is the effect that athletes can notice
        the difference in their breathing as more oxygen is carried
        throughout the system and as more acids are neutralized.[i] The
        difference can be stunning for those whose respiration is
        labored under intense exercise loading.[ii] This tells us to
        take very seriously the oral use of bicarbonate for cancer
        treatment no matter what other treatment is used. <br>
        <br>
        This diagram shows the diffusion directions for H+, CO2, and O2
        between the blood and the muscle cells during exercise. The
        resulting concentration changes affect the buffer equilibria,
        shown in the upper right-hand corner of the diagram (yellow). If
        the amounts of H+ and CO2 exceed the capacity of hemoglobin,
        they affect the carbonic acid equilibrium, as predicted by Le
        Châtelier's Principle or the quantitative treatment in terms of
        equilibrium constants. As a result, the pH of the blood is
        lowered, causing acidosis. The lungs and kidneys respond to pH
        changes by removing CO2, HCO3-, and H+ from the blood. <br>
        <br>
        When one reads my thesis on different medicinal substances one
        has to always remember that I am a protocol man who does not
        support single shot cures for anything. With the publication of
        today’s chapter on sodium bicarbonate and maple syrup sodium
        bicarbonate slips securely into the number three spot right
        behind magnesium chloride and iodine. Each of these three
        substances effects directly onto basic human physiology in a way
        most pharmaceutical drugs do not. When used together we have a
        super threesome that will inexpensively go far to resolving many
        of the physical and even some of the emotional problems we and
        our children face. And if you have not made the connection
        please note that all three of these substances are used in
        emergency rooms and intensive care wards and they do commonly
        save lives every day with their inherent healing powers. See my
        chapter on emergency room medicine and cancer treatment.<br>
        <br>
        All cancer sufferers and in fact every chronic disease patient
        should hold clearly in mind that pH is the regulatory authority
        that controls most cellular processes. The pH balance of the
        human bloodstream is recognized by medical physiology texts as
        one of the most important biochemical balances in all of human
        body chemistry. pH is the acronym for "Potential Hydrogen". In
        definition, it is the degree of concentration of hydrogen ions
        in a substance or solution. It is measured on a logarithmic
        scale from 0 to 14. Higher numbers mean a substance is more
        alkaline in nature and there is a greater potential for
        absorbing more hydrogen ions. Lower numbers indicate more
        acidity with less potential for absorbing hydrogen ions. <br>
        <br>
        Our body pH is very important because pH controls the speed of
        our body's biochemical reactions. It does this by controlling
        the speed of enzyme activity as well as the speed that
        electricity moves through our body; the higher (more alkaline)
        the pH of a substance or solution, the more electrical
        resistance that substance or solution holds. Therefore,
        electricity travels slower with higher pH. If we say something
        has an acid pH, we are saying it is hot and fast. Alkaline pH on
        the other hand, bio-chemically speaking, is slow and cool. <br>
        <br>
        Body ph level changes are intense in the profundity of their
        biological effects. Even genes directly experience external pH.
        pH differentially regulates a large number of proteins.
        Increased oxidative stress, which correlates almost
        exponentially with ph changes into the acidic, is especially
        dangerous to the mitochondria, which suffer the greatest under
        oxidative duress. Epigenetics, which may now have begun
        eclipsing traditional genetics, commonly describes how factors
        such as diet and smoking, rather than inheritance influence how
        genes behave. <br>
        <br>
        The following chapter comes after 100 pages of text in the Yeast
        and Fungi Invaders section of the Winning the War on Cancer
        book. Please note that sodium bicarbonate taken in water alone
        will have a powerful effect on entire body physiology because of
        the instant shift into alkaline pH levels. Bicarbonate can be
        taken frequently throughout the day with half teaspoons amounts
        though for long term use lower doses are safer. For cancer
        patients initial use should be heavy and frequent to force a
        greater shift because smaller pH shifts can actually stimulate
        cancer growth. <br>
        <br>
        Common sense knowledge speaks loudly about cancer and Candida
        patients avoiding glucose. This is similar to the common sense
        of pilots who know to pull back on the stick to pull out of a
        dive. That works until you approach the speed of sound and at
        that point all the pulling in the world will not work. You have
        to push the stick forward and do what instincts scream not to
        do. Several died trying until Chuck Yeager pushed that stick
        forward and became the first man to break the speed of sound.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bicarbonate Maple Cancer
          Treatment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The bicarbonate maple syrup cancer treatment focuses on
        delivering natural chemotherapy in a way that effectively kills
        cancer cells but significantly reduces the brutal side effects
        experienced with most standard chemotherapy treatments. In fact
        so great is the reduction that the dangers are brought down to
        zero. Costs, which are a factor for the majority of people, of
        this particular treatment are nil. Though this cancer treatment
        is very inexpensive, do not assume it is not effective. The
        bicarbonate maple syrup cancer treatment is a very significant
        cancer treatment every cancer patient should be familiar with
        and it can easily be combined with other safe and effective
        natural treatments. <br>
        <br>
        This cancer treatment is similar in principle to Insulin
        Potentiation Therapy (IPT). IPT treatment consists of giving
        doses of insulin to a fasting patient sufficient to lower blood
        sugar into the 50 mg/dl. In a normal person, when you take in
        sugar the insulin levels go up to meet the need of getting that
        sugar into the cells. In IPT they are artificially injecting
        insulin to deplete the blood of all sugar then injecting the
        lower doses of toxic chemo drugs when the blood sugar is driven
        down to the lowest possible value. During the low peak, it is
        said that the receptors are more sensitive and take on
        medications more rapidly and in higher amounts.<br>
        <br>
        The bicarbonate maple syrup treatment works in reverse to IPT.
        Dr. Tullio Simoncini acknowledges that cancer cells gobbles up
        sugar so when you encourage the intake of sugar it’s like
        sending in a Trojan horse. The sugar is not going to end up
        encouraging the further growth of the cancer colonies because
        the baking soda is going to kill the cells before they have a
        chance to grow. Instead of artificially manipulating insulin and
        thus forcefully driving down blood sugar levels to then inject
        toxic chemo agents we combine the sugar with the bicarbonate and
        present it to the cancer cells, which at first are going to love
        the present. But not for long! <br>
        <br>
        This treatment is a combination of pure, 100% maple syrup and
        baking soda and was first reported on the Cancer Tutor site.
        When mixed and heated together, the maple syrup and baking soda
        bind together. The maple syrup targets cancer cells (which
        consume 15 times more glucose than normal cells) and the baking
        soda, which is dragged into the cancer cell by the maple syrup,
        being very alkaline forces a rapid shift in pH killing the cell.
        The actual formula is to mix one part baking soda with three
        parts (pure, 100%) maple syrup in a small saucepan. Stir briskly
        and heat the mixture for 5 minutes. Take 1 teaspoon daily, is
        what is suggested by Cancer Tutor but one could probably do this
        several times a day. <br>
        <br>
        “There is not a tumor on God’s green earth that cannot be licked
        with a little baking soda and maple syrup.” That is the
        astonishing claim of controversial folk healer Jim Kelmun who
        says that this simple home remedy can stop and reverse the
        deadly growth of cancers. His loyal patients swear by the man
        they fondly call Dr. Jim and say he is a miracle worker. “Dr.
        Jim cured me of lung cancer,” said farmer Ian Roadhouse. “Those
        other doctors told me that I was a goner and had less then six
        months to live. But the doc put me on his mixture and in a
        couple of months the cancer was gone. It did not even show up on
        the x-rays.” <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Jim discovered this treatment accidentally somewhere in the
        middle of the last century when he was treating a family plagued
        by breast cancer. There were five sisters in the family and four
        of them had died of breast cancer. He asked the remaining sister
        if there was anything different in her diet and she told him
        that she was partial to sipping maple syrup and baking soda.
        Since then, reported by a newspaper in Ashville, North Carolina,
        Dr. Jim dispensed this remedy to over 200 people diagnosed with
        terminal cancer and amazingly he claims of that number 185 lived
        at least 15 more years and nearly half enjoyed a complete
        remission of their disease. When combined with other safe and
        effective treatments like transdermal magnesium therapy, iodine,
        vitamin C, probiotics and other items like plenty of good sun
        exposure, pure water and clay treatments we should expect even
        higher remission rates. <br>
        <br>
        It is very important not to use baking soda which has had
        aluminum added to it. The Cancer Tutor site reports that Arm and
        Hammer does have aluminum but the company insists that is not
        true. One can buy a product which specifically states it does
        not include aluminum or other chemicals. (e.g. Bob's Red Mill,
        Aluminum-Free, Baking Soda). Sodium bicarbonate is safe,
        extremely inexpensive and unstoppably effective when it comes to
        cancer tissues. It’s an irresistible chemical, cyanide to cancer
        cells for it hits the cancer cells with a shock wave of
        alkalinity, which allows much more oxygen into the cancer cells
        than they can tolerate. Cancer cells cannot survive in the
        presence of high levels of oxygen. Studies have already shown
        how manipulation of tumor pH with sodium bicarbonate enhances
        some forms of chemotherapy.[iii] <br>
        <br>
        “The therapeutic treatment of bicarbonate salts can be
        administered orally, through aerosol, intravenously and through
        catheter for direct targeting of tumors,” says oncologist Dr.
        Tullio Simoncini. “Sodium bicarbonate administered orally, via
        aerosol or intravenously can achieve positive results only in
        some tumors, while others – such as the serious ones of the
        brain or the bones - remain unaffected by the treatment.” <br>
        <br>
        The maple syrup apparently enables and increases penetration of
        bicarbonate into all compartments of body, even those which are
        difficult or impossible to penetrate by other means. These
        compartments include the central nervous system (CNS), through
        the blood-brain barrier, joints, solid tumors, and perhaps even
        the eyes. IPT makes cell membranes more permeable, and increases
        uptake of drugs into cells. The maple syrup will make tissues
        more permeable, too. It will transport the bicarbonate across
        the blood-brain barrier and every other barrier in the body for
        sugar is universally needed by all cells in the body. The
        essence of IPT is that it allows cancer drugs to be given in a
        smaller dose, far less toxic to normal cells, while building up
        lethally toxic concentrations in cancer cells. Both IPT and
        bicarbonate maple syrup treatments use the rabid growth
        mechanisms of the cancer cell against them. <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Jim did not have contact with Dr. Simoncini and did not know
        that he is the only oncologist in the world who would sustain
        the combining of sugar with bicarbonate. Dr. Simoncini always
        directs his patients to dramatically increase sugar intake with
        his treatments but has never thought to mix the two directly by
        cooking them together. Because his treatments depend on
        interventionist radiologists who insert catheters to direct the
        bicarbonate as close to the affected area as possible, or
        physicians willing to do expensive intravenous treatments, I
        pushed bicarbonate up into the number six slot in the IMVA
        cancer protocol. With the discovery of Dr. Jim’s work
        bicarbonate comes back into our number three spot right behind
        magnesium chloride and iodine. <br>
        <br>
        That number three slot for a brief time was held by hemp oil
        containing THC. The great advantage that maple syrup and
        bicarbonate treatment has over this type hemp oil is that it is
        legal thus easily obtainable. The two together, backed by a
        solid protocol of other nutritional substances makes winning the
        war on cancer almost a certainty. When using these substances it
        is safer to change one’s vocabulary and not say one is treating
        and curing cancer. Far better to conceptualize that one is
        treating the infectious aspect of cancer, the fungus and yeast
        colonies and the yeast like bacteria that are the cause of TB. <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Simoncini says that, “In some cases, the aggressive power of
        fungi is so great as to allow it, with only a cellular ring made
        up of three units, to tighten in its grip, capture and kill its
        prey in a short time notwithstanding the prey's desperate
        struggling. Fungus, which is the most powerful and the most
        organized micro-organism known, seems to be an extremely logical
        candidate as a cause of neoplastic proliferation.” <br>
        <br>
        pH of the blood is the most important factor to determine the
        state of the microorganisms in the blood. <br>
        <br>
        “Sodium bicarbonate therapy is harmless, fast and effective
        because it is extremely diffusible. A therapy with bicarbonate
        for cancer should be set up with strong dosage, continuously,
        and with pauseless cycles in a destruction work which should
        proceed from the beginning to the end without interruption for
        at least 7-8 days. In general a mass of 2-3-4 centimeters will
        begin to consistently regress from the third to the fourth day,
        and collapses from the fourth to the fifth,” says Dr Simoncini.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many ways to use sodium bicarbonate and it is a
        universal drug like iodine and magnesium chloride. Raising pH
        increases the immune system's ability to kill bacteria,
        concludes a study conducted at The Royal Free Hospital and
        School of Medicine in London. Viruses and bacteria that cause
        bronchitis and colds thrive in an acidic environment. To fight a
        respiratory infection and dampen symptoms such as a runny nose
        and sore throat, taking an alkalizing mixture of sodium
        bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate will certainly help. <br>
        <br>
        The apple cider vinegar 1/4 teaspoon and 1/4 teaspoon baking
        soda taken 2 times or more a day is another treatment as is
        lemon and baking soda, or lime and baking soda formulas. Perhaps
        honey could be substituted for maple syrup for those who live in
        parts of the world where maple syrup is not available but to my
        knowledge no one has experimented with this. <br>

        [i] The breakdown of glucose or glycogen produces lactate and
        hydrogen ions - for each lactate molecule, one hydrogen ion is
        formed. The presence of hydrogen ions, not lactate, makes the
        muscle acidic that will eventually halt muscle function. As
        hydrogen ion concentrations increase the blood and muscle become
        acidic. This acidic environment will slow down enzyme activity
        and ultimately the breakdown of glucose itself. Acidic muscles
        will aggravate associated nerve endings causing pain and
        increase irritation of the central nervous system. The athlete

        <p>Remember Dr. Tullio Simoncini and his treatment of cancer as
          a fungus? If not, you can reread an article called "Cancer Is
          A Fungus" in my August 2, 2007 newsletter. It's at: </p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">www.Beating-Cancer-Gently.com/nl108.html</span>
        <p>The story told of Jim Kelmun, a 75-year old former truck
          driver and his success in helping people heal cancer using --
          you guessed it -- baking soda and maple syrup. Seein' as how
          I'm a 76-year old former airplane driver who has helped a
          couple thousand people recover from cancer, I figured ol' Jim
          from Asheville and I had a lot in common and I better pass on
          his story (and Dr. Mark's reaction to it) to you, my loyal
          readers, and see what you think. </p>
        <p>First, here's a short quote from the story, so you get the
          drift. <br>
        </p>
        <p><i>[Kelmun]...has no medical degree and authorities are
            demanding that he stop dispensing his 'wonder drug' -- or
            face a prison sentence. </i></p>
        <p><i>But his loyal patients swear by the man they fondly call
            'Dr. Jim' -- and say he's a miracle worker. </i></p>
        <p><i>'Dr Jim cured me of lung cancer,' declares farmer Ian
            Rodhouse, 64. 'Those other doctors told me I was a goner ahd
            had less than six months to live.' </i></p>
        <p><i>'But the doc put me on his mixture -- and in a couple of
            months, the cancer was gone. It didn't even show up on
            X-rays.' </i></p>
        <p><i>The gentle, silver-haired grandfather -- who has been
            preparing home remedies since 1954 -- says he first hit upon
            the miracle cure in the mid-1970's, when he was treating a
            family plagued by breast cancer. </i></p>
        <p><i>'There were five sisters in the family and all of them
            passed away from the big C by age 50 -- except one,' he
            recalls. </i></p>
        <p><i>'I asked if there was anything different in her diet. She
            told me she was partial to sipping maple syrup and baking
            soda. </i></p>
        <p><i>'I figured, let me try it out on some of my other
            patients.' </i></p>
        <p><i>Since then, 'Dr. Jim' has dispensed his mixture to more
            than 200 patients diagnosed with terminal cancer. Amazingly,
            he claims that of that number, 185 lived at least 15 more
            years -- and nearly half enjoyed a complete remission of
            their disease."</i> </p>
        <p>Well, you get the idea. When Dr. Sircus and I discussed this
          subject, it was obvious that the "goofy" article on "Dr. Jim"
          had made him put on his thinking cap (which is quite well worn
          -- Dr. Mark is one of the "thinkingest" docs I know). In fact,
          he sent me an article he had written on the subject that
          should interest any of you "battling" cancer. </p>
        <p>You may recall that Dr. Sircus has a regimen for treating
          cancer which includes magnesium chloride, iodine, selenium and
          alpha lipoic acid. After reading of Dr. Simoncini's work, he
          added baking soda to his regimen. But even Dr. Simoncini
          recognized the limitations of his own baking soda treatment.
          Here's a quote from Dr. Simoncini: </p>
        <p><i>"The therapeutic treatment of bicarbonate salts [baking
            soda] can be administered orally, through aerosol,
            intravenously and through catheter for direct targeting of
            tumors...[but it] can achieve positive results only in some
            tumors, while others - such as the serious ones of the brain
            or the bones - remain unaffected by the treatment."</i></p>
        <p>Dr. Mark's thinking led him to an interesting hypothesis.
          What if, he said, baking soda and maple syrup worked just like
          IPT (Insulin Potentiated Therapy)? Here are some quotes from
          his article: </p>
        <p><i>"IPT treatment consists of giving doses of insulin to a
            fasting patient sufficient to lower blood sugar into the 50
            mg/dl. Then they inject lower doses of toxic chemo drugs
            [when the cancer cell] receptors are more sensitive and take
            on medications more rapidly and in higher amounts. </i></p>
        <p><i>The bicarbonate/maple syrup treatment works in reverse to
            IPT. Dr. Tullio Simoncini acknowledges that cancer cells
            gobble up sugar so when you encourage the intake of sugar
            it's like sending in a Trojan horse. The sugar is not going
            to encourage the growth of the cancer colonies because the
            baking soda is going to kill the cells before they have a
            chance to grow. </i></p>
        <p><i>The treatment is a combination of pure, 100% maple syrup
            [bulk Grade B from the health food store] and baking soda
            and was first reported on the Cancer Tutor site. When mixed
            and heated together, the maple syrup and baking soda bind
            together. The maple syrup targets cancer cells (which
            consume 15 times more glucose than normal cells) and the
            baking soda, which is dragged into the cancer cell by the
            maple syrup, being very alkaline forces a rapid shift in pH
            killing the cell. </i></p>
        <p><i>The actual formula is to mix one part baking soda with
            three parts (pure, 100%) maple syrup in a small saucepan.
            Stir briskly and heat the mixture for 5 minutes. Take one
            teaspoon daily is what is suggested by Cancer Tutor but one
            could probably do this several times a day."</i> </p>
        <p>In summary, Dr. Sircus says: </p>
        <p><i>"The maple syrup apparently enables and increases
            penetration of bicarbonate into all compartments of the
            body, even those which are difficult or impossible to
            penetrate by other means. These compartments include the
            central nervous system (CN, through the blood-brain barrier,
            joints, solid tumors, and perhaps even the eyes. IPT makes
            cell membranes more permeable, and increases uptake of drugs
            into cells. The maple syrup will make tissues more
            permeable, too. It will transport the bicarbonate across the
            blood-brain barrier and every other barrier in the body for
            sugar is universally needed by all cells in </i><span
            style="font-style: italic;">the body...Both IPT and
            bicarbonate/maple syrup treatments use the rabid growth
            mechanisms of cancer cells against them."</span></p>
        <p>There you have it, folks. Can you imagine this mixture
          harming you? Two or three teaspoons a day? Would I try it? You
          bet. It meets all my criteria: simple, effective, inexpensive
          and available anywhere in the world. </p>
        <p>Incidentally, Dr. Sircus has moved baking soda/maple syrup up
          to Number Three in his regimen -- right behind magnesium
          chloride and iodine. </p>
        Thanks, Dr. Sircus, for your magnificently open mind and
        flexibility in applying your knowledge to new ideas. Well,
        according to Jim Kelmun, it's no new idea -- just another
        suppressed cancer treatment that works.

        <h4 style="text-align: center;">CONCLUSIONS of CANCER TUTOR ON
          THIS PROTOCOL</h4>

        The <u>Weekly World News</u> is the source of the information
        for this treatment. This tabloid was published out of Boca
        Raton, Florida. It specialized in writing articles which other
        newspapers would not publish. However, most people would agree
        that many of their published articles were pure fiction. They
        still have a presence online.
        <p>We have not been able to validate the authenticity of the
          article which discusses the Kelmun protocol, nor has anyone
          validated the authenticity of anyone interviewed in the
          article. </p>
        <p>The treatment is a combination of baking soda and maple
          syrup. After a thorough analysis of this treatment the Cancer
          Tutor website has decided <b>NOT</b> to endorse or even
          support this treatment. </p>
        <p>While the Kelmun protocol may be effective in the digestive
          tract, there are well-established treatments which are known
          to be effective in the digestive tract. </p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Simoncini, <b><u>who is for real</u></b>,
          and is a well-known oncologist in Italy, says that baking soda
          and water are only effective on cancers of the digestive
          tract, from the throat to the end of the colon. Cancers
          outside of the digestive tract need the baking soda <b><u>injected
              so that the baking soda is not neutralized by the
              digestive tract.</u></b> </p>
        <p>Also, the Vitamin C and Baking Soda protocol mentioned on
          this website is also superb at dealing with digestive tract
          cancers. </p>
        <p>Thus, there is no real reason for a third baking soda
          treatment for the digestive tract. </p>
        <p>The real issue is getting the baking soda past the digestive
          tract. With Dr. Simoncini the baking soda is injected. This
          creates a localized area of the body which has a high
          concentration of baking soda. It is an effective treatment. </p>
        <p>With the Kelmun protocol the maple syrup cannot get the
          baking soda past the digestive tract because there is no
          chemical way for maple syrup and baking soda to chemically
          bind. Furthermore, even if there was a way, there are still
          serious problems. </p>
        <p>First, getting the baking soda past the digestive tract does
          not create a localized area of high concentrations of baking
          soda. </p>
        <p>It is <b>NOT</b> advisable to create a wide area of a high
          concentration of baking soda because the blood must remain at
          a constant pH. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, human blood already contains some baking soda.
          The baking soda acts as a buffer for acids. </p>
        <p>Human blood must remain at a constant pH or else the person
          may die. It is not wise to tamper with this pH. Baking soda
          already in the blood is used by the body to keep the blood
          from becoming too acidic. </p>
        <p>Some have suggested that the combination of baking soda and
          maple syrup in the stomach creates carbon dioxide which is
          helpful in treating cancer. </p>
        <p>The fact is that carbon dioxide is present throughout your
          body. Every cell in the body excretes carbon dioxide. The
          blood carries this carbon dioxide to the lungs where it is
          discharged when you breathe. </p>
        <p>Claiming that adding carbon dioxide to the body is good is
          like saying that taking a shower outside, during a
          thunderstorm, is good. </p>
        <p>In short, <b><u>this treatment is not in any way endorsed or
