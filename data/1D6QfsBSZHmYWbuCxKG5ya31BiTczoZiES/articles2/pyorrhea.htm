      denticola and even more preferably by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
      Said gum diseases, in particular gingivitis and periodontitis
      (pyorrhea), are primarily caused by a pro-inflammatory response to
      components of P. gingivalis, leading to destruction of periodontal
      tissue, and are often accompanied by osteoclastogenesis (increased
      number of osteoclasts responsible for destruction of bone tissue),

      amount of water to form a gel or further mixing 10-50% tooth
      powder based on <b>50-90% bittern</b>. Since bittern is

      of pyorrhea when tooth is brushed with a tooth-brush holding the
      dentifrice. Components of bittern such as <b>magnesium salt,
