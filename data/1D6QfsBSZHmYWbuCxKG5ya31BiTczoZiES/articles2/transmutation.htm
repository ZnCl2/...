      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accelerator-driven transmutation
        of spent fuel elements</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An apparatus
      and method is described for transmuting higher actinides,
      plutonium and selected fission products in a liquid-fuel
      subcritical assembly. Uranium may also be enriched, thereby
      providing new fuel for use in conventional nuclear power plants.
      An accelerator provides the additional neutrons required to
      perform the processes. The size of the accelerator needed to
      complete fuel cycle closure depends on the neutron efficiency of
      the supported reactors and on the neutron spectrum of the actinide
      transmutation apparatus. Treatment of spent fuel from light water
      reactors (LWRs) using uranium-based fuel will require the largest
      accelerator power, whereas neutron-efficient high temperature gas
      reactors (HTGRs) or CANDU reactors will require the smallest
      accelerator power, especially if thorium is introduced into the
      newly generated fuel according to the teachings of the present
      invention. Fast spectrum actinide transmutation apparatus (based
      on liquid-metal fuel) will take full advantage of the
      accelerator-produced source neutrons and provide maximum
      utilization of the actinide-generated fission neutrons. However,
      near-thermal transmutation apparatus will require lower standing
      inventories of plutonium and higher actinides. Uranium, presently
      the largest volume constituent in nuclear waste, is fully utilized
      and not discharged as waste. Since no plutonium, higher actinides
      or fission products are present in the reconstituted fuel
      elements, the present processes can be used repeatedly. Since the
      performance of the existing reactors is not changed, full
      utilization of both thorium and uranium resources is achieved. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A new
      transmutation assembly permits an efficient transmutation of a
      long-lived radioactive material (long-lived FP nuclides such as
      technetium-99 or iodine-129) which was produced in the nuclear
      reactor. Wire-type members of a long-lived radioactive material
      comprised of metals, alloys or compounds including long-lived FP
      nuclides are surrounded by a moderator material and installed in
      cladding tubes to form FP pins. The FP pins, and nothing else, are
      housed in a wrapper tube to form a transmutation assembly. The
      wire-type members can be replaced by thin ring-type members. The
      transmutation assemblies can be selectively and at least partly
      loaded into a core region, a blanket region or a shield region of
      a reactor core in a fast reactor. From a viewpoint of reducing the
      influence on the reactor core characteristics, it is optimal to
      load the transmutation assemblies into the blanket region.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The present
      invention addresses the problems outlined above. An accelerator
      based on a combination of a high repetition rate high energy
      pulsed power supply (RHEPP) and a magnetically-injected anode
      plasma (MAP) source diode is used to provide pulsed particle beams
      having intermediate energy (0.2-20 MeV) and average power levels
      of hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts. This will increase the rate
      of isotopic production by 2-3 orders of magnitude over processes
      based on conventional accelerators. Any gaseous ion can be
      accelerated with this technology (proton, deuteron, and helium
      beams are of special interest). This capability can be applied to
      transmute target nuclei selectively into desired isotopes.
      RHEPP/MAP accelerators are also extremely power efficient and
      relatively small in size, making application of small units
      practical in, for example, major local or regional medical
      facilities. Finally, the use of relatively low beam particle
      energies reduces or eliminates the problem of undesired products
      and the subsequent generation of radioactive waste. Although the
      invention is being discussed in terms of embodiment via the
      RHEPP/MAP system, any pulsed ion beam generator having sufficient
      ion kinetic energy and total average beam current can be used in
      the same manner.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Apparatus for
      nuclear transmutation and power production using an intense
      accelerator-generated thermal neutron flux. High thermal neutron
      fluxes generated from the action of a high power proton
      accelerator on a spallation target allows the efficient burn-up of
      higher actinide nuclear waste by a two-step process. Additionally,
      rapid burn-up of fission product waste for nuclides having small
      thermal neutron cross sections, and the practicality of small
      material inventories while achieving significant throughput derive
      from employment of such high fluxes. Several nuclear technology
      problems are addressed including 1. nuclear energy production
      without a waste stream requiring storage on a geological
      timescale, 2. the burn-up of defense and commercial nuclear waste,
      and 3. the production of defense nuclear material. The apparatus
      includes an accelerator, a target for neutron production
      surrounded by a blanket region for transmutation, a turbine for
      electric power production, and a chemical processing facility. In
      all applications, the accelerator power may be generated
      internally from fission and the waste produced thereby is
      transmuted internally so that waste management might not be
      required beyond the human lifespan. <br>

      transmuting spent fuel from a nuclear reactor includes the step of
      separating the waste into components including a driver fuel
      component and a transmutation fuel component. The driver fuel,
      which includes fissile materials such as Plutonium.sup.239, is
      used to initiate a critical, fission reaction in a reactor. The
      transmutation fuel, which includes non-fissile transuranic
      isotopes, is transmuted by thermal neutrons generated during
      fission of the driver fuel. The system is designed to promote
      fission of the driver fuel and reduce neutron capture by the
      driver fuel. Reacted driver fuel is separated into transuranics
      and fission products using a dry cleanup process and the resulting
      transuranics are mixed with transmutation fuel and re-introduced
      into the reactor. Transmutation fuel from the reactor is
      introduced into a second reactor for further transmutation by
      neutrons generated using a proton beam and spallation target. <br>

      relates to field of liquid radioactive wastes recycling.
      Long-living radionuclides are isolated from nitric acid solution
      of used nuclear fuel (UNF) into solid phase in form of acetates,
      oxides and other compounds, which do not contain elements strongly
      activated with neutrons. Radionuclides are imbedded and fixed in

      transmuting spent fuel from a nuclear reactor includes the step of
      separating the waste into components including a driver fuel
      component and a transmutation fuel component. The driver fuel,
      which includes fissile materials such as Plutonium&lt;239&gt;, is
      used to initiate a critical, fission reaction in a reactor. The
      transmutation fuel, which includes non-fissile transuranic
      isotopes, is transmuted by thermal neutrons generated during
      fission of the driver fuel. The system is designed to promote
      fission of the driver fuel and reduce neutron capture by the
      driver fuel. Reacted driver fuel is separated into transuranics
      and fission products using a dry cleanup process and the resulting
      transuranics are mixed with transmutation fuel and re-introduced
      into the reactor. Transmutation fuel from the reactor is
      introduced into a second reactor for further transmutation by
      neutrons generated using a proton beam and spallation target.<br>

      exposed to a neutron flux by distributing it in a
      neutron-diffusing medium surrounding a neutron source. The
      diffusing medium is transparent to neutrons and so arranged that

      be used to produce useful radioisotopes, in particular for medical

      included in the exposed material. It may also be used to
      efficiently transmute long-lived radioactive wastes, such as those
      recovered from spent nuclear fuel. The use of heavy elements, such
      as lead and/or bismuth, as the diffusing medium is particularly of

        Abstract</span> -- The invention relates to nuclear physics and
      can be used for neutralizing long-lived radioactive isotopes
      contained, for example, in radioactive waste (RW) of the nuclear
      engineering. A radioactive isotope undergoes exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation and a deep ionization of the isotope
      atoms is performed. Deep ionization of the atoms results in an
      energy-permitted expedient B-decay thereof prohibited in a neutral
      state. Measures are taken in order to prevent ionized atoms from
      recombination with short-lived nucleus. The retention time must be
      long enough to transmit at least a part of the parent nucleus into
      the short-lived and stable daughter nucleus. For ensuring a factor
      k of an operating time of said daughter nucleus, the retention is
      performed at least during a time Ki, i is a life time of the
      parent nucleus at the expedient B-decay. A charge-particle beam
      (electrons, protons or ions) is used for electromagnetic
      irradiation. The charge-particle beam irradiation can be combined
      with the photon flux irradiation. The intentive method makes it
      possible to speed up the transmutation of the long-lived
      radioactive isotopes without using nuclear collisional reactions
      accompanied by the production of radioactive co-products.<br>

      radioactive waste treatment process for transmuting long-lived
      radioisotopes into short-lived radioisotopes through applied
      nuclear physics. Nuclear reactions, specifically of the (gamma, n)
      type, also known as photodisintegration, are utilized to
      accomplish this transmutation from troublesome, long-lived
      radioactive waste isotope(s) of given atomic mass to shorter-lived
      or stable materials of lower atomic mass, by exposing the
      troublesome isotopes to a high energy photon flux for a sustained
      time. Generally speaking, the target nucleus of the
      radioisotope(s) to be treated is irradiated by gamma photons of an
      energy greater than the binding energy of the neutron in the
      target nucleus. This causes the irradiated nucleus to absorb the
      gamma rays, thereby placing the nucleus in an excited state. Upon
      relaxation, the nucleus ejects a neutron through the (gamma, n)
      reaction, thereby transmuting the element to an isotope of lower
      atomic mass and shorter half-life.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Radioactive
      wastes are placed in nuclear explosion zone of weapon plutonium
      wherein intensive neutron flux is allowed to pass through them to
      convert them to steam that condenses into particles measuring
      about 10-6 cm. Neutron flux and heat energy released due to
      explosion of weapon plutonium cause transmutation of nuclides in
      desired quantities and their separation into long- and
      short-living ones in condensed state from steam by centrifuging.
      Proposed technique provides for using products of explosion to
      produce electrical energy and transuranium elements. EFFECT:
      provision for peaceful use of weapon plutonium.<br>

        Abstract</span> -- A new transmutation assembly permits an
      efficient transmutation of a long-lived radioactive material
      (long-lived FP nuclides such as technetium-99 or iodine-129) which
      was produced in the nuclear reactor. Wire-type members of a
      long-lived radioactive material comprised of metals, alloys or
      compounds including long-lived FP nuclides are surrounded by a
      moderator material and installed in cladding tubes to form FP
      pins. The FP pins, and nothing else, are housed in a wrapper tube
      to form a transmutation assembly. The wire-type members can be
      replaced by thin ring-type members. The transmutation assemblies
      can be selectively and at least partly loaded into a core region,
      a blanket region or a shield region of a reactor core in a fast
      reactor. From a viewpoint of reducing the influence on the reactor
      core characteristics, it is optimal to load the transmutation
      assemblies into the blanket region.<br style="font-weight: bold;">

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An apparatus
      and method is described for transmuting higher actinides,
      plutonium and selected fission products in a liquid-fuel
      subcritical assembly. Uranium may also be enriched, thereby
      providing new fuel for use in conventional nuclear power plants.
      An accelerator provides the additional neutrons required to
      perform the processes. The size of the accelerator needed to
      complete fuel cycle closure depends on the neutron efficiency of
      the supported reactors and on the neutron spectrum of the actinide
      transmutation apparatus. Treatment of spent fuel from light water
      reactors (LWRs) using uranium-based fuel will require the largest
      accelerator power, whereas neutron-efficient high temperature gas
      reactors (HTGRs) or CANDU reactors will require the smallest
      accelerator power, especially if thorium is introduced into the
      newly generated fuel according to the teachings of the present
      invention. Fast spectrum actinide transmutation apparatus (based
      on liquid-metal fuel) will take full advantage of the
      accelerator-produced source neutrons and provide maximum
      utilization of the actinide-generated fission neutrons. However,
      near-thermal transmutation apparatus will require lower standing
      inventories of plutonium and higher actinides. Uranium, presently
      the largest volume constituent in nuclear waste, is fully utilized
      and not discharged as waste. Since no plutonium, higher actinides
      or fission products are present in the reconstituted fuel
      elements, the present processes can be used repeatedly. Since the
      performance of the existing reactors is not changed, full
      utilization of both thorium and uranium resources is achieved.<br>
