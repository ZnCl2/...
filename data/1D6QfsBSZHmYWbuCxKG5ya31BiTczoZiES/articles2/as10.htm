            that reverses signs of aging!</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A "space drink" developed by NASA to protect astronauts from
      radiation can also reduce wrinkles and reverse the telltale signs
      of ageing in just four months, say researchers, following a human
      trial. A team at Utah University has found in its research that
      the concoction, known as AS10, dramatically reduces wrinkles,
      blemishes and sun damage after four months. <br>
      <br>
      The drink can apparently reduce signs of aging in just four
      months: At the start of their trial, the researchers took visia
      photographs -- which reveal the condition of the skin below the
      surface by using different types of light exposure -- of 180
      participants. They again took the photos after four months of
      drinking two shots of AS10 a day. By the end UV spots were reduced
      by 30 per cent and wrinkles by 17 per cent, the 'Daily Mail'
      reported. <br>
      <br>
      AS10 was developed as a nutritional supplement for astronauts to
      protect them from the damaging effects of high levels of radiation
      outside the Earth's atmosphere. The drink contains a blend of
      fruits including cupuacu (a Brazilian fruit from the cacao plant
      family), acai, acerola, prickly pear and yumberry, which all
      provide vitamins and phytochemicals -- compounds known to block
      the harmful effects of radiation. Other ingredients are grape,
      green tea, pomegranate and vegetables.<br>

      The North American Space Agency (NASA) has told BeverageDaily.com
      that it has nothing to do with wonder ‘space drink’ AS10, but the
      brand’s UK distributor insists the agency did co-develop a 'NASA
      Quintet’ of superfruits used in the beverage.<br>
      <br>
      A rash of stories in outlets as august as the New York Daily News
      in the US and The Mail in the UK this week copied the same claims:
      that non-existent University of Utah research into the NASA
      beverage showed ‘miraculous’ results in reversing UV spots and
      wrinkles.<br>
      <br>
      Drinking just two shots of the drink daily cut UV spots by 30% and
      wrinkles by 17%, The Mail gushed, while the paper also quoted
      ‘University of Utah nutritional scientist’, Dr Aaron Barson,
      comparing free radicals to ‘Pacmen’ taking bites out of molecules
      in cells.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>University of Utah denies involvement</b><br>
      <br>
      But beyond the glut of news articles, BeverageDaily.com was unable
      to locate any reference to any University of Utah research study
      published online.<br>
      <br>
      A University of Utah spokeswoman told BeverageDaily.com on Friday:
      “Dr. Aaron V. Barson, Jr. was a volunteer/adjunct clinical
      assistant professor at the University of Utah from 1988 through
      2002.”<br>
      <br>
      She added: “He currently has no affiliation with the University of
      Utah and the research attributed to him in the story that ran
      originally in the New York Daily News titled ‘Space drink’
      concocted by NASA helps reduce wrinkles is in no way connected to
      the University of Utah.” <br>
      <br>
      AS10 was developed as a nutritional supplement for astronauts to
      protect them from high radiation levels outside the Earth’s
      atmosphere – The Mail claimed – modestly priced at £30 (€37) per
      750ml, pictured left.<br>
      <br>
      The paper published “startling images [that] may prove that a
      fruit drink developed NASA to protect astronauts from radiation
      can rejuvenate the skin”, and cited a “groundbreaking study”
      showing that the AS10 beverage “dramatically reduces wrinkles,
      blemishes and sun damage after four months”.<br>
      <br>
      According to its UK brand website, replete with astronaut imagery
      , AS10 fuses “next generation super fruit” cupuacu, acai, acerola,
      prickly pear and yumberry mixed with “five top ingredients from
      our joint research with NASA Johnson Space Centre”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>'Not a NASA food product'</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      But William Jeffs from NASA’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston
      (which runs the agency’s Advanced Food Technology Project), told
      BeverageDaily.com on Friday: “In short, the ‘AS10’ drink substance
      mentioned in this news story is not a NASA food product.”<br>
      <br>
      He added: “NASA has not used any material or food substance
      described in these various news stories, nor are we conducting any
      research related to the claims made in these news stories.”<br>
      <br>
      However, David Wilson, AmeriSciences UK Master Distributor, told
      BeverageDaily.com&nbsp; that The Mail story “has been picked up by
      other agencies across the world who have not reproduced it
      naturally”, with neither the University of Utah or NASA involved
      in Aaron Barson’s “small study”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Media misreporting blamed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Wilson said he was “extremely frustrated” by media misreporting,
      and that PR agencies sent data (not seen by BeverageDaily.com)
      omitted to say that it a ‘NASA Quintet’ of five ‘super fruits’
      added to AS10 that accounted for its effects, whereas astronauts
      took the quintet in gel capsule form.<br>
      <br>
      “It really is the responsibility of the media to ensure their
      content is correct. NASA didn’t develop the AS10 drink itself,”
      Wilson said. “But as you can see they were involved in joint
      research to develop the active ingredients in the drink.”<br>
      <br>
      By way of evidence, Wilson sent us a link to a 2011 paper
      published in the journal Radiation Research , reporting increased
      survival rates for female mice exposed to ionizing radiation and
      fed a fruit and vegetable AmeriSciences/NASA antioxidant premix,
      compared to a control diet.<br>
      <br>
      The lead NASA research contact for that study was one Dr Jeffrey
      Jones , Wilson said, and the firm’s NASA collaboration stemmed
      from a 2005 Space Act Agreement to co-develop nutritional
      supplements for astronauts.<br>
      <br>
      Houston-based AmeriSciences’ website is currently offline, and
      Wilson said the company was currently undergoing a restructuring
      process “that will hopefully be finished soon”.<br>

      What is unique about the AS10 Combination?<br>
      <br>
      Why take supplements based on space research?<br>
      <br>
      Based on joint research with NASA / Johnson Space Centre -&nbsp;
      the AS10 Combination is a combined multi-vitamin and anti-oxidant
      formula.<br>
      <br>
      Civilian formulas based in part on joint research between
      AmeriSciences® and NASA/JSC are now available in the UK. These
      products are the AS10 drink, the AS10 Fusion healthy energy drink
      and AS10 Life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Astronauts Test Use of Nutritional Supplements in Space</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After nearly four years of joint research of Houston-based
      AmeriSciences® and NASA / Johnson Space Center (JSC), a senior
      NASA medical officer has confirmed that two of the resulting
      nutritional supplement formulas were used and tested in space by
      the astronauts of mission STS-125 of May 11, 2009 and the mission
      STS-127 of July 15, 2009 and are now in use and testing aboard the
      International Space Station.<br>
      <br>
      This marks a milestone in the advancement of a project between
      AmeriSciences® and NASA/JSC to develop nutritional supplements for
      the astronauts to meet the needs of long-duration space flight as
      well as conditioning here on Earth. Commenced through a Space Act
      Agreement between AmeriSciences® and NASA/JSC back in the fall of
      2005, this joint research effort has now progressed to in-flight
      testing as well as clinical ground studies to determine safety and
      effectiveness of the resulting formulations.<br>
      <br>
      "NASA/JSC has always had to push forward with new technologies to
      meet the extreme conditions of outer space ... nutritional
      supplementation is another one of those areas of technology in
      which NASA can make a significant contribution to society as a
      whole while promoting the health of the participants in their
      space program," comments Lou Gallardo, Chairman of AmeriSciences®.
      "We a proud to be working closely with NASA/JSC on this project
      and combining all of our expertise to create the best products
      possible for the astronauts."<br>
      <br>
      The years of preparation and research by experts from both
      AmeriSciences® and NASA has led to the use and testing of
      antioxidant and multivitamin formulations aboard the Space Shuttle
      and International Space Station. The commencement of use and
      testing of these formulas on Space Shuttle mission STS-125 was
      important to said research as this mission to repair the Hubble
      Space Telescope presented extra physiological challenges.
      Prolonged Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs or "space walks") and
      the high-orbit location of the telescope exposed the astronauts to
      an increased risk of higher levels of radiation and other medical
      concerns.<br>
      <br>
      "This is just the first step towards preparing for the rigours of
      long-duration space flight on the human body," explains Gallardo,
      "the good news is that the results from this research can impact
      everyone's health here on Earth”.<br>

      oxidative exposure treatment composition such that the life
      shortening effects induced by the radiation source or the
      oxidative stress are ameliorated.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] Statement Regarding Federally Sponsored Research or
      Development:<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Pursuant to an assignment to Jeffrey A. Jones, a former
      U.S. Government Employee, the U.S. Government retains, pursuant to
      15 U.S.C. 3710d(a), a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable,
      paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention
      practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the U.S.
      Government.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The field of invention relates to compositions and methods
      useful for pre- treating and treating a subject exposed to
      radiation. More specifically, the field of invention relates to
      compositions and methods for reducing the risk for and
      ameliorating the radiation- induced life shortening effects from
      exposure to a radiation source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Oxidative damage is the result of the human body
      metabolizing oxygen so that the cells can produce the energy that
      runs all the chemical reactions that sustain life. During this
      critical process, the body produces dangerous molecules that react
      with cell proteins and DNA to cause irreversible damage.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Oxidative damage is well documented during many activities,
      including space flight, lunar exploration and space walks.
      Exposure to oxidative insults occurs to astronauts during
      extravehicular activities (EVA), including increased oxygen
      exposure (hyperoxia), radiation, and exercise. Risks from
      increased oxidative damage include increased muscle fatigue,
      increased risk for cataracts, macular degeneration, cardiovascular
      disease, and many forms of cancer, as well as a number of other
      chronic diseases. Currently there is no effective countermeasure
      to mitigate oxidative damage during these activities. As humanity
      contemplates lunar missions, with greatly increased EVA frequency
      and durations, mitigating oxygen-related health risks is
      important.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Ionizing radiation induces nuclear DNA strand breaks, which
      initiate a transfer to the mitochondria of both pro-apoptotic and
      anti-apoptotic molecules. The molecular events that occur early in
      the initiation of apoptosis originate at the mitochondrial
      membrane. The events include molecular sequelae of both oxidative
      and nitrosative stress, which produces rapid depletion of
      antioxidant stores. Antioxidant depletion at the mitochondria
      associates with disruption of cytochrome C binding to cardiolipin,
      mitochondrial membrane disruption, and leakage into the cytoplasm
      of cytochrome C. These disruptions and ruptures initiate a cascade
      of molecular events that eventually lead to apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There are many sources of oxidative stress in the lives of
      workers, whether they work in nuclear power facilities, on the
      front lines of international conflicts, in hospitals, or in the
      reaches of outer space. The exposure dose can vary substantially,
      but at minimum will accelerate the aging of their organ systems,
      and at worse could result in acute exposure syndromes that may be
      fatal. A common thread of the oxidative stress exposures is
      reactive oxygen species (ROS)-binding to critical cellular
      organelles and molecules, which can result in cellular
      dysfunction, mutation of nucleic acids, or even apoptotic cell
      death. Currently there are no proven countermeasures for these
      exposures, aside from a clinical agent, amifostine, which reduces
      mucositis and other side effects from radiation therapy dose in
      cancer patients, and Iodine in the form of potassium iodide
      tablets, which reduces the likelihood of thyroid exposure to
      radioactive iodine.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Radiological terrorism, nuclear accidents, and astronauts
      outside of the earth's protective atmosphere are instances where
      acute radiation events can expose humans to radiation-based
      injuries. The long-term effects of acute radiation exposure
      include cataract formation, carcinogenesis, neurological
      degeneration, and other biomarkers of radiation- induced aging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] Radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      comprise a mixture of micronutrient multivitamin and trace
      elements, a mixture of antioxidants and chemopreventative agents,
      and optionally a mixture of fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Mixtures of micronutrient multivitamin and trace elements
      includes amounts of vitamin A, some of which is beta-carotine;
      vitamins Bp, Bl, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, C, D, E and K. The
      mixture also includes an amount of inositol. The mixture also
      includes amounts of calcium, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium,
      copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, potassium, boron and
      vanadium. [0011] Mixtures of non-essential antioxidants and
      chemopreventative agents include bioflavins, which include rutin,
      quercetin, hesperidin; alpha lipoic acid (ALA), N-acetyl-L-
      cysteine (NAC), lutein, lycopene, astaxanthin, plant sterols,
      isoflavones, garlic extract, which provides allicin; green tea
      extract, which provides epigallocatech gallate; cruciferous
      vegetable extract, which provides glucosinolates; fruit extracts,
      ginkgo biloba extract, coenzyme Q-10, and resveratrol.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Mixtures of fatty acids when included in a radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment composition provides essential
      omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Methods of treatment of a subject exposed to a radiation
      source or an oxidative stress, or both, with the radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment composition include the step of
      administering to the subject a daily dose of the radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment composition such that the life
      shortening effects induced by the radiation source or the
      oxidative stress are ameliorated.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In some methods the administration of the daily dose of the
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition occurs on a
      continuing daily basis for at least 7 days before exposure to the
      radiation source or oxidative stress. In some other methods, the
      administration of the daily dose of the radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment composition occurs on a continuing daily basis
      after exposure to the radiation source or oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Some methods include the step of administering to the
      subject an amount of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
      plasmid DNA in liposome at least 24 hours before exposure to the
      radiation source.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The daily dose of radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
      composition can be administered proportionally during the 24-hour
      period such that the sum of the proportional amounts totals the
      daily dose.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>Problem</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] Because acute radiation sickness (ARS) occurs within a very
      short period, the opportunity to treat or mitigate the effects of
      high-dose irradiation is limited. As an augmentation to treatment,
      prophylactic measures can be a more effective strategy to address
      acute radiation-induced phenomenon. Preventing the onset of ARS
      may also minimize other biological consequences of ionizing
      radiation, which is an additional benefit.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Developing countermeasures for radiation injury has a long
      history and is very challenging. Joint research with NASA has
      postulated that that the era of high-dose single counter-radiation
      agents is ending. Development of a multi-pathway defense strategy
      via comprehensive dietary ingredient cocktail is a successful
      approach to protect the human body against either acute or chronic
      sources of oxidative damage or radiation exposure. Oxidative
      damage in humans working or living in extreme environments is
      widespread and affects many cellular components. Clinical research
      shows downstream biological effects from this damage are variable,
      based upon host factors, dose quality, magnitude and rate, as well
      as the presence or absence of countermeasures.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] There is accumulating evidence for a role of oxidative
      stress in both the acute and chronic effects of ionizing
      radiation. Administration of organ- specific targeted antioxidant
      therapies, including manganese superoxide dismutase plasmid DNA in
      liposome (MnSOD-PL) gene product, can increase survival rates due
      to a decrease in acute and chronic toxicities of single-fraction
      and fractionated irradiation. Systemic administration of
      antioxidant agents, including amifostine, GS-nitroxide and
      superoxide dismutases (SODs), also decreases acute and chronic
      toxicities.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] With respect to late effects of ionizing radiation, two
      categories of studies exist. Prior studies report improved
      conditional survival of MnSOD-PL-treated high-dose- irradiated
      animals for acute radiation events. Other studies describe
      improved conditional survival effects of antioxidants in low-doses
      or partial-body-irradiated animals; however, these studies use
      very high dosages of antioxidants such that they are toxic to the
      subject.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] Certain antioxidants (e.g., a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid,
      beta-carotene, etc.), have properties that protect cells from
      oxygen free -radical toxicity, and therefore can decrease the type
      of oxidative damage observed among subjects exposed to radiation,
      particularly astronauts exposed to radiation or hypobaric
      hyperoxia. Additionally, antioxidants can reduce oxidative damage
      associated with prolonged hyperoxic environments, among other
      culprits of oxidative damage.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant capable of reversing
      endothelial dysfunction caused by increased oxidant stress. Though
      it seems likely that vitamin C supplementation would mitigate
      hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage among extravehicular activities
      (EVA), it is debated whether vitamin C could act as a pro-oxidant
      when iron stores are elevated. Vitamin C can also act as a
      pro-oxidant in large doses as a single-agent. Treatments with
      vitamin A, C, or E can protect rats exposed to acute hyperoxia
      (80% oxygen) against oxygen toxicity by elevating glutathione
      concentration. Vitamin E supplementation to rabbits can decrease
      lipid peroxidation and diminish increases in pulmonary antioxidant
      enzymes induced by in vitro 100% oxygen exposure. These increases
      likely contribute to symptoms of oxidative stress, a-tocopherol is
      also effective in preventing hyperoxia- induced DNA fragmentation
      and apoptosis. Flavonoids appear to exhibit more antioxidant
      effects than a- tocopherol in healthy adults. In addition to a
      plethora of other tested agents (e.g., a-lipoic acid, folic acid,
      co-enzyme Q10, selenium, beta carotene, glutathione, and N-
      acetylcysteine), there are a large number of plant extracts that
      have antioxidant properties, including strawberry and blueberry,
      curcumin, and green tea.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Quercetin, a plant bioflavanoid, appears to be a powerful
      antioxidant and free radical scavenger while also demonstrating
      desirable anti-carcinogenic, neuroprotective, antiviral, and
      cardio/vascular protective properties. Quercetin also appears to
      help prevent cataract formation and exhibit positive effects on
      cognitive performance and immune response. In vitro experiments
      suggest it may be beneficial in protecting against bone loss.
      Furthermore, recent studies suggest having a protective mechanism
      against viral illness after exertional stress in athletes and
      synergistic properties with other micronutrients such as Vitamin
      C, B3, and omega- 3 fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Additionally, supplementing animals exposed to carcinogens
      and ionizing radiation with omega-3 fatty acids and fiber can
      reduce the risk of cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids show a benefit of
      improving lipid parameters in those individuals with unfavorable
      total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratios. Combinations
      of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      other fatty acids appear to show efficacy in improving cognitive
      performance and mood in test subjects with affective disorders,
      traumatic brain injury, and exposure to environmental stress.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of
      several conditions leading to declining functionality, both in
      normal as well as diseased individuals. Dietary antioxidants can
      play a role in neutralizing free radicals caused by factors
      including exposure to radiation.<br>

      <b>Radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] Compositions comprising low levels of each of the most
      effective micronutrient multivitamins, trace elements,
      antioxidants, chemoprevention agents and optionally certain fatty
      acids, allows for a broad range of cellular protection and
      bioavailability without the toxicity usually associated with high
      single doses of particular vitamins, elements, antioxidants,
      chemoprevention agents, and lipids. [0032] Radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment compositions comprise a mixture of
      micronutrient multivitamin and trace elements, a mixture of
      antioxidants and chemopreventative agents, and optionally a
      mixture of fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      include a mixture of micronutrient multivitamins and trace
      elements. The low levels of each of the most effective protection
      molecules allows delivery to a subject, such as a human, without
      the toxicity associated with high-dose, oral single agents, and
      with conceivably better efficacy. Most micronutrient multivitamins
      and trace elements are at the levels of federally Recommended
      Daily Allowance. Some vitamins with antioxidant capacity are at
      slightly higher but safe dosage levels (i.e., well below levels of
      any adverse effect).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      comprise a mixture of antioxidants and chemopreventative agents.
      The non-essential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents
      derive from natural foods and herbal sources. Many of the
      nonessential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents
      demonstrate antioxidant effects. Previous studies in scientific
      peer-reviewed journals report doses as such safe, including the
      NIH consensus conference on dietary supplements. Recommendations
      by the National Cancer Institute/Chemoprevention Branch for
      possible reductions in cancer development risk, epidemiological
      reviews, and testing in randomized, placebo-controlled studies
      provide additional support for their safe use.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Optionally, the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
      compositions include a mixture comprising fatty acids, including
      omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty acids, specifically fatty acids
      obtained from fish oil, have been found to have a number of
      beneficial health effects. It is understood that oil from fish
      contains EPA and DHA. These are classified as omega-3 fatty acids.
      These omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil are known to keep
      blood triglycerides in check and may inhibit the progression of
      atherosclerosis. EPA and DHA are believed to have
      anti-inflammatory activity and are sometimes used as dietary
      supplements with inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease
      and rheumatoid arthritis. It is believed that the omega-3 fish oil
      fatty acids may balance other fatty acids. When fatty acids are
      out of balance in the body, the body may release chemicals that
      promote inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for
      prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that
      regulate dilation of blood vessels, inflammatory responses, and
      other critical body processes. DHA and EPA are also believed
      essential for nerve and eye functions. DHA comprises about 60
      percent of the outer rod segments of photoreceptor cells that are
      used to see with by humans. Brain tissue has a substantial
      component of fat composed of DHA. It is believed that fish oil
      omega-3 fatty acids and, specifically, DHA and EPA, are useful in
      wet macular degeneration since these fatty acids help heal and
      support blood vessel walls. Studies show that eating fish several
      times a month may reduce the risk of developing AMD.<br>

      [0036] Pharmacopeial compendia, including the United States
      Pharmacopeia and National Formulary (USP 32-NF 27), give the
      materials and specifications for micronutrient vitamins (e.g.,
      ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol), trace elements (e.g., potassium,
      zinc), and other coenzyme and non-botanical constituents (e.g.,
      coenzyme Q-10, choline bitartrate, N-acetyl cysteine) for the
      radiation exposure treatment compositions.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Micronutrient vitamin and trace element mixtures</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] The first mixture comprises micronutrient vitamins and
      trace elements. The first dietary supplement can contain various
      vitamins important for the dietary requirement of animals,
      including mammals, and especially humans (homo sapiens), including
      Vitamins A, Bp, Bl, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, C, D, E and K.
      Some of the vitamins also have antioxidant properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] There may be more than one source for micronutrient
      vitamins. Vitamin A palmitate and beta-carotene, and combinations
      of the two, are sources of Vitamin A. Choline bitartrate is a
      source of choline. Ascorbic acid is a source of Vitamin C. Sodium
      ascorbate is also a source for Vitamin C. Cholecalciferol is a
      source of Vitamin D. D-alpha tocopheryl succinate and mixed
      tocopherols, and combinations of the two, are sources of Vitamin
      E. Natural and mixed carotenoids are preferred sources of Vitamin
      E. Phytonadione is a source of Vitamin K. Thiamine can originate
      from thiamine mononitrate, which provides Vitamin Bl. Riboflavin
      is a source of Vitamin B2. Niacin can originate from inositol
      hexanicotinate, which provides Vitamin B3. Pyridoxine
      hydrochloride is a source of Vitamin B6. Folate can originate from
      folic acid, which provides Vitamin B9. Cyanocobalamin is a source
      of Vitamin B12. Biotin is a source of B7. Pantothenic acid can
      originate from d-calcium pantothenate, which provides Vitamin B5.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The first dietary supplement also contains inositol.
      Although no longer considered a Vitamin B complex on its own, many
      vitamin supplement formulations still include inositol for its
      general bioactivity. Inositol hexanicotinate is the
      niacin-esterified version of inositol. Inositol and inositol
      hexanicotinate, and combinations of the two, can provide inositol.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The first dietary supplement can also contain various trace
      elements important for the dietary requirement of mammals,
      especially humans, including calcium, iodine, magnesium, zinc,
      selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, potassium,
      boron and vanadium.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] There may be more than one source for trace elements.
      Calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate, and combinations of the
      two, are sources of calcium. Kelp is a source of iodine. Magnesium
      oxide and chelate, and combinations of the two, are sources of
      magnesium. Zinc chelate [monomethionine], zinc oxide and zinc
      gluconate are sources of zinc. Zinc oxide provides the most
      concentrated form of elemental zinc. 1- Selenomethionine is a
      source of selenium. Copper amino acid chelate, copper oxide and
      copper gluconate are sources of copper. Manganese amino acid
      chelate is a source of manganese. Chromium polynicotinate is a
      source of chromium. Molybdenum amino acid chelate is a source of
      molybdenum. Potassium citrate is a source of potassium. Boron
      chelate is a source of boron. Vanadyl sulfate is a source of
      vanadium.<br>

      [0048] Vitamin C is arguably the most important water-soluble
      biological antioxidant. It can scavenge both reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species thought to play roles
      in tissue injury associated with the pathogenesis of various
      conditions. By virtue of this activity, it inhibits lipid
      peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage and oxidative protein damage.
      It helps preserve intracellular reduced glutathione
      concentrations, which in turn helps maintain nitric oxide levels
      and potentiates its vasoactive effects. In addition, vitamin C may
      modulate prostaglandin synthesis to favor the production of
      eicosanoids with antithrombotic and vasodilatory activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The mechanisms underlying the immune effects of zinc are
      not fully understood, though some of them may be accounted for by
      its membrane- stabilization effect. Zinc is also believed to have
      secondary antioxidant activity. Although zinc does not have any
      direct redox activity under physiological conditions, it
      nevertheless may influence membrane structure by its ability to
      stabilize thiol groups and phospholipids. It may also occupy sites
      that might otherwise contain redox active metals such as iron.
      These effects may protect membranes against oxidative damage. Zinc
      also comprises the structure of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase
      (Cu/Zn SOD), a very powerful antioxidant. Additionally, it may
      have secondary antioxidant activity via the copper-binding protein
      metallothionein.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate ester) is hydrolyzed by a
      pancreatic hydrolase and combined with bile acids and other fats
      prior to its uptake by enterocytes in the form of micelles. It is
      then re-esterified and secreted by the enterocytes into the
      lymphatic system in the form of chylomicrons. These chylomicrons
      enter the circulation via the thoracic duct and undergo metabolism
      via lipoprotein lipase. Most of the retinyl esters are then
      rapidly taken up into liver parenchymal cells and again hydrolyzed
      to all-trans retinol and fatty acids (e.g., palmitate). All-trans
      retinol may be then stored by the liver as retinyl esters or
      transported in the circulation bound to serum retinol binding
      protein (RBP). Serum RBP is the principal carrier of retinol,
      which comprises greater than 90% of serum vitamin A. It is
      believed that RBP in association with transthyretin or prealbumin
      co-transport proteins are responsible for the transport of retinol
      into target cells. All-trans retinol is delivered to the cornea
      via the tears and by diffusion through eye tissue. Retinol is
      oxidized to retinal via retinol dehydrogenase. Retinal is
      metabolized to retinoic acid via retinal dehydrogenase. The
      metabolites of retinol and retinoic acid undergo gucuronidation,
      glucosylation and amino acylation. They are excreted mainly via
      the biliary route, though some excretion of retinol and its
      metabolites also occurs via the kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Intestinal absorption of vitamin C occurs primarily via a
      sodium-dependent active transport process, although some diffusion
      may also come into play. The major intestinal transporter is SVCT1
      (sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1). Some ascorbic acid may
      be oxidized to dehydroascorbic (DHAA) acid and transported into
      enterocytes via glucose transporters. Within the enterocytes, all
      DHAA is reduced to ascorbic acid via reduced glutathione, and
      ascorbic acid leaves the enterocytes to enter the portal and
      systemic circulation for distribution throughout the body. The
      transporter SVCT2 appears to aid in the transport of vitamin C
      into the aqueous humor of the eyes. Though it cannot itself cross
      the blood-brain barrier, ascorbic acid may be oxidized to DHAA and
      be transported to the brain tissues via GLUT1 (glucose transporter
      1), where it can then be reduced back to ascorbic acid for
      utilization. Metabolism and excretion of vitamin C occurs
      primarily via oxidation to DHAA and hydrolyzation to
      diketogulonate, though other metabolites such as oxalic acid,
      threonic acid, L-xylose and ascorbate-2-sulfate can also result.
      The principal route of excretion is via the kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Vitamin D is principally absorbed in the small intestine
      via passive diffusion. It is delivered to the enterocytes in
      micelles formed from bile acids, fats, and other substances. Like
      vitamin A, vitamin D is secreted by the enterocytes into the
      lymphatic system in the form of chylomicrons and enters the
      circulation via the thoracic duct. It is also transported in the
      blood bound to an alpha globulin known as Vitamin D-Binding
      Protein (DBP) and the group- specific component (Gc) protein. Much
      of the circulating vitamin D is extracted by the hepatocytes to be
      metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] or calcidiol via the
      enzyme vitamin D 25 -hydroxylase. 25(OH)D is then metabolized in
      the kidney to the biologically active hormone form of vitamin D,
      calcitrol [l,25(OH)2D], via the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D-l-alphahydroxylase. Calcitrol may undergo further hydroxylation
      and metabolism into 24,25(OH)2D and l,24,25(OH)3D. These
      metabolites, as well as vitamin D are excreted primarily via the
      biliary route. The final degradation product of l,25(OH)2D is
      calcitroic acid, which is excreted by the kidney.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Much of the pharmacokinetics of zinc in humans remains
      unknown. Zinc is absorbed all along the small intestine, though
      most appears to be assimilated from the jejunum. Zinc uptake
      across the brush border appears to occur by both a saturable
      barrier- mediated mechanism and a non-saturable non-mediated
      mechanism. The exact mechanism of zinc amino-acid chelates (such
      as the zinc-methionine used in AmeriSciences OS2) transport into
      the enterocytes remains unclear, but evidence demonstrates greater
      bioavailability than other supplemental forms. Zinc transporters
      have been identified in animal models. Once the mineral is within
      the enterocytes, it can be used for zinc-dependent processes,
      become bound to metallothionein and held within the enterocytes or
      pass through the cell. Transport of zinc across the serosal
      membrane is carier-mediated and energy-dependent. Zinc is
      transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A fraction of
      zinc is extracted by the hepatocytes, and the remaining zinc is
      transported to the various cells of the body via the systemic
      circulation. It is transported bound to albumin (about 80%),
      alpha-3-macroglobulin (about 18%), and to such proteins as
      transferin and ceruloplasmin The major route of zinc excretion
      appears to be the gastrointestinal tract via biliary, pancreatic
      or other gastrointestinal secretions. Fecal zinc is also comprised
      of unabsorbed dietary zinc as well as the sloughing of mucosal
      cells.<br>

      <b>Antioxidant and chemopreventative agent mixtures</b><b><br>

      [0054] The antioxidant and chemopreventative agent mixture is a

      other ancillary compounds, which can provide antioxidant activity
      and some measure of protection against oxidative stress.<br>

      for isoflavones. Bulb garlic is a source for garlic extract. Green
      tea leaf is a source for green tea extract and epigallocatech
      gallate. The green tea leaf extract is standardized to 95%
      polyphenols and 50% epigallocatech gallate (EGCG). Broccoli
      sprouts are a source for cruciferous vegetable extract.
      Strawberries, escobillo, blueberries, blackberries, cranberries,
      grapes, and pomegranates are sources for fruit blends. Ginkgo
      biloba leaves are a source for ginkgo biloba extract.<br>

      [0056] Quercetin, rutin and hesperidin are flavonols with a phenyl
      benzo(c)pyrone- derived structure. Extraction of the quercetin
      glycosides, primarily rutin, from plants, produces commercial
      quantities of quercetin. Citrus peel, apples, onions and Uncaria
      leaves are useful for the isolation and synthesis of quercetin.
      Preferably, the starting material for the flavonols for the
      non-essential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents is
      immature sun-dried Fava d'Anta beans (Dimorphandra mollis or
      Dimorphandra gardeneriana). The manufacturing process for
      quercetin includes the aqueous extraction of rutin from the plant
      source, release of the aglycone via hydrolysis through the
      addition of an acidic aqueous solution, and neutralization to
      produce a crude crystalline quercetin product. Several
      purification processes to the resultant quercetin product yields
      purified quercetin crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Green tea extract originates from the leaves of Camellia
      sinensis. Gently washing, drying, shivering, compacting and
      keeping the leaves at controlled room temperature under low
      humidity conditions occurs prior to extract processing. Extraction
      takes place in a reactor using purified water at about 90 [deg.]C.
      Processing at high pressure and lower temperatures concentrates
      the intermediate extraction product. Food processing appropriate
      solvents assist in providing a filtered and crystallized extract.
      Drying and powdering to specification completes the production
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Antioxidant and chemoprevention agent mixtures contain a
      blend of fruit concentrates and extracts having elevated
      antioxidant values. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Database
      for the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) lists
      antioxidant values. Processing whole fruits of F. ananassa
      (strawberry), E. vaccinium (blueberry), R. rubus (blackberry) and
      E. vaccinium (cranberry) for use in the non-essential natural
      antioxidants and chemoprevention agents mixture includes washing
      and treating only with water. Drying and blending into powdered
      fruit concentrates completes the processing of the fruits.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Percolation processes can produce extracts from M. glabra
      (Escobillo), V. vinifera (grape) and P. granatum (pomegranate)
      using solutions of water, ethanol or combinations of both as a
      solvent. Homogenization of the extracts occurs in a two-stage
      process with heated transfer lines. A spray dry tower powders the
      extracts.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] All fruit-sourced materials undergoes visual inspection and
      metal detection scanning before blending and combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Brassica oleracea italia seed has perceived health benefits
      and high antioxidant values attributed to its content of
      sulforaphane. Collections of the seeds are the precursor for
      growing and cultivating broccoli sprouts in pesticide-free
      conditions. The harvesting of florets of young broccoli occurs to
      maximize glucosinolate content. Processing technology controls
      endogenous myrosinase enzymes to prevent sulforaphane digestion.
      The process does not use solvents. Approximately 20 pounds of
      broccoli sprouts yield 1 pound of cruciferous vegetable extract
      material (i.e., a 20: 1 concentration). [0062] Resveratrol
      (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic compound of the
      class of stilbenes. Some types of plants produce resveratrol and
      other stilbenes in response to stress, injury, fungal infection
      and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Resveratrol- 3- Obeta- glucoside
      is a piceid. Vitis vinifera, Carignane and Cinsault varieties are
      whole red grapes from the Rhone Valley in Southern France. Grape
      seeds and skins collected from wine fermentation vessels form the
      extraction material. A multistep process involving water
      extraction and purification of polyphenols on adsorbent resin
      ensures high purity and reproducibility. Prior to blending and
      release, standardization, quality assurance testing and metal
      detection scanning occurs. Approximately 500 to 750 pounds of red
      grapes yields 1 pound of the standardized extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Isoflavones are polyphenolic compounds commonly found in
      legumes, including soybeans. The most common and abundant soy
      isoflavone aglycone is genistein, followed by daidzein and
      glycitein. The soy isoflavone isolate starts off with non-GMO
      soybeans that undergo extraction with water and ethanol,
      filtration, elution with a resin, concentration and a second round
      of filtration. Drying, pulverizing, assaying, diluting, and
      blending the extract achieves standardization specifications.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Astaxanthin is a carotenoid with known antioxidant
      properties and documented effects on immunology, muscular
      endurance, visual acuity, reduced rate of macular degeneration,
      and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The algae Haematococcus
      pluvialis, cultivated in Hawai'i, is a starting material for
      astaxanthin extract. Washing, drying, and pulverizing occur after
      harvesting. Effused supercritical C02 extracts a dried biomass
      intermediate. The product forms from mixing the resulting
      oleoresin extract intermediate with stabilizing ingredients
      generally recognized by the Food and Drug Administration and then
      spray dried. Milling and chilsonating the end product occurs to
      the specified mesh size to finish the product.<br>

      [0067] Astaxanthin has both lipo- and hydrophilic antioxidant
      activity, working both inside as well as outside cell membranes.
      Astaxanthin is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and
      effectively work inside retinal tissues. Evidence suggests it
      inhibits the neurotoxicity induced by peroxide radicals or serum
      deprivation; reduces the intracellular oxidation induced by
      various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, astaxanthin
      reduced the expressions of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-modified
      protein (indicator of lipid peroxidation) and
      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; indicator of oxidative DNA
      damage) in animal models. These findings indicate that astaxanthin
      has positive effects against cellular damage in-vivo, and that its
      protective effects may be partly mediated via its antioxidant
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) forms a redox couple with its
      metabolite, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) and may scavenge a wide
      range of reactive oxygen species. Both ALA and DHLA can scavenge
      hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide radicals, peroxynitrite, hydrogen
      peroxide and hypochlorite. ALA, but not DHLA, may scavenge singlet
      oxygen, and DHLA, but not ALA, may scavenge superoxide and peroxyl
      reactive oxygen species.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] ALA has been found to decrease urinary isoprostanes, O-LDL
      and plasma protein carbonyls, markers of oxidative stress.
      Furthermore, ALA and DHLA have been found to have antioxidant
      activity in aqueous as well as lipophilic regions, and in both
      extracellular as well as intracellular environments. ALA is also
      involved in the recycling of other biological antioxidants such as
      vitamins C and E, as well as glutathione.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Alpha lipoic acid pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that its
      absorption takes place from the small intestine, followed by
      portal circulation delivery to the liver, and to various tissues
      in the body via systemic circulation. Alpha lipoic acid readily
      crosses the blood brain barrier, and is readily found (following
      distribution to the various tissues) extracellularly,
      intracellularly and intramitochondrially. It is metabolized to its
      reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) by mitochondrial lipoamide
      dehydrogenase, which can in turn form a redox couple with lipoic
      acid. ALA is also metabolized to lipoamide, which forms an
      important cofactor in the multienzyme complexes that catalyze
      pyruvate and alpha- ketoglutarate, both important aspects of
      cellular respiration and energy production via the Krebs cycle.
      ALA can also be metabolized to dithiol octanoic acid, which can
      undergo catabolism.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin appear to be more
      efficiently absorbed when administered with high-fat meals. They
      are hydrolyzed in the small intestine via esterates and lipases,
      and solubilized in the lipid core of micelles formed from bile
      acids and other lipids. They can also form clathrate complexes
      with conjugated bile salts. Both of these complexes can deliver
      carotenoids to the enterocytes, where they are then released into
      the lymphatics in the form of chylomicrons. From there, they are
      transported to the general circulation via the thoracic duct.
      Lipoprotein lipases hydrolyze much of the triglyceride content in
      the chylomicrons found in the circulation, resulting in the
      formation of chylomicrons remnants, which in turn retain
      apolipoproteins E and B48 on their surfaces and are mainly taken
      up by the hepatocytes. Within the liver, carotenoids are
      incorporated into lipoproteins and they appear to be released into
      the blood mainly in the form of HDL and - to a much lesser extent
      - VLDL. Astaxanthin is distributed throughout the body, with
      muscle tissue seemingly receiving larger concentrations based on
      tissue/plasma ratio at 8 and 24 hours after oral ingestion. Lutein
      appears to undergo some metabolism in-situ to meso- zeaxathin.
      Xanthophylls as well as their metabolites are believed to be
      excreted via the bile and, to a lesser extent, the kidney.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fatty acid mixture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0072] Fatty acid mixtures contain fatty acids, including
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
      Preferred fatty acids are essential omega-3 fatty acids. The
      omega-3 fatty acids can derive from small feeder fish typically
      found at or near the bottom of the food chain, including sardines,
      anchovies, and mackerel. These marine species are advantageously
      devoid of the contaminants typically associated with more
      predatory, higher marine species.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Molecularly distilled fish body oil that is highly
      purified, concentrated and standardized can provide specific
      amounts of essential omega-3 (n-3) poly-unsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic
      Acid (EPA).<br>
      <br>

      useful fatty acid mixtures for use with radiation and oxidative
      exposure treatment compositions. Table 6 shows the daily dose of a

      [0075] In some embodiment mixtures, the total amount of omega-3
      fatty acids in the fatty acid mixture is about 1200 mg.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;img id="imgf000021_0002" he="37" wi="152"

      <br>
      exposure treatment compositions [0076] In some embodiment mixtures
      of fatty acids, the amount of EPA for a daily does is about 720
      mg. In some other embodiment mixtures of fatty acids, the amount
      of DHA for a daily does is about 480 mg.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Following ingestion, EPA and DHA undergo hydrolysis via
      lipases to form monoglycerides and free fatty acids. In the
      enterocytes, reacylation takes place and this results in the
      formation of triacylglycerols, which are then assembled with
      phospholipids, cholesterol and apoproteins into chylomicrons.
      These are then released into the lymphatic system from whence they
      are transported to the systemic circulation. Here, the
      chylomicrons are degraded by lipoprotein lipase, and EPA &amp; DHA
      are transported to various tissues of the body via blood vessels,
      where they are used mainly for the synthesis of phospholipids.
      Phospholipids are incorporated into the cell membranes of red
      blood cells, platelets, neurons and others. EPA and DHA are mainly
      found in the phospholipid components of cell membranes. DHA is
      taken up by the brain and retina in preference to other fatty
      acids. DHA can be partially and conditionally reconverted into
      EPA, and vice- versa, although the process is thought to be
      less-than-efficient and may be adversely affected by age.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
      are essential omega-3 fatty acids and both play a role in the
      formation of anti-inflammatory and immunemodulating eicosanoids.
      As such, they have several actions in a number of body systems.
      Both play an important role in the maintenance of normal blood
      flow as they lower fibrinogen levels. DHA is vital for normal
      neurological function throughout life. Several mechanisms are
      believed to account for the anti-inflammatory activity of EPA and
      DHA. Most notably, the two competitively inhibit the conversion of
      arachidonic acid to the proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
      and leukotriene B4 (LKB4), thus reducing their synthesis. EPA and
      DHA also inhibit the synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta. EPA and
      DHA inhibit the 5-LOX (lipoxygenase) pathway responsible for the
      conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory leukotrienes in
      neutrophils and monocytes and can suppress phospholipase
      C-mediated signal transduction, also involved in inflammatory
      events. EPA is the precursor to series-3 prostaglandins, series-5
      leukotrienes (LTB5) and series-3 thromboxanes (TXA3). This could
      account in part for its microvascular and anti-inflammatory role.
      Furthermore, EPA is a precursor of resolvins (Rv) such as RvEl and
      RvDl which may help reduce tear gland inflammation, increase tear
      volume and ocular lubrication. [0079] EPA and DHA have both
      similar and dissimilar physiologic roles. EPA appears to be more
      important in those roles where the eicosanoids are involved such
      as inflammation as well as tear gland function and tear
      production, whereas DHA seems to play its most important role in
      offering structural protection to the retina and other
      neurovascular structures such as corneal nerves.<br>

      [0080] Blending in suitable devices combines the components of
      each mixture. For example, mixing can occur in a V-type blender.
      One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the devices and
      apparatuses best suited for combining the components of the
      mixture comprising nonessential natural antioxidants and
      chemoprevention agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions,
      which comprise micronutrient vitamins, trace elements,
      non-essential natural antioxidants, chemoprevention agents and
      optionally fatty acids, can ameliorate the chronic,
      life-shortening effects of radiation exposure after exposure.
      Treatment with radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
      compositions can also ameliorate organ- specific late radiation
      injuries, which may include pulmonary fibrosis, renal failure,
      hepatic fibrosis and central nervous system damage, which can
      result in neuro-cognitive impairment. As well, treatment with
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions can also
      ameliorate the acute effects of total-body irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Administration of the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
        composition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0082] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      as described, which contain amounts of micronutrient multivitamin,
      trace elements, non-essential antioxidants, chemopreventative
      agents, and optionally fatty acids, are useful for pre- or
      post-exposure treatment to radiation sources or sources of
      oxidative stress, or both, that impact a subject. Exposure to
      either or both of these damaging sources can induce
      life-shortening effects. Daily administration of the radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment compositions can ameliorate these
      post-exposure life-shortening effects. The composition can be
      effective for subjects exposed to radiation in outer space.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The administration of the radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment compositions can be self-introduced, making oneself the
      subject of the daily administration of the treatment. Examples of
      self-introduction include orally consuming the composition with
      meals or as capsules, injecting oneself with a solution comprising
      the composition, and applying an ointment comprising the
      composition to one's skin. Examples of administration of the
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions to a subject
      not oneself include feeding a subject a foodstuff comprising the
      composition as part of a daily meal and injecting a subject with a
      solution comprising the composition. One of ordinary skill in the
      art can device numerous methods of administering radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment compositions to various subjects to
      effect the proper daily dose. These can include time- release
      capsules, orally ingested liquids, intraperitoneal, intravenous,
      subcutaneous, sublingual, transcutaneous, intramuscular, and other
      well-understood forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] "Subjects" include, without limitation, animals, which
      include mammals, which also include dogs, cats, mice and humans
      (homo sapiens).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      are "daily dose" amounts. That is, the radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment compositions as described represent the amount
      of radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions that are
      for administration during a 24-hour period or on a daily basis to
      a subject to ameliorate the life shortening effects of radiation
      exposure or oxidative stress, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition
      can be administered or introduced to a subject as a pure or
      refined material. Typically, the composition is dilution by
      blending with other materials for ingestion or injection,
      including foodstuffs (water, drinks, meals, chow mixes) edible
      solids, gels; palatable liquids and solutions; salines and fluids
      for intramuscular administration; and inert binding materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Oral consumption is the preferred method of administration
      since digestion metabolizes many of the component mixtures,
      especially antioxidant compounds, into their active and protective
      forms. Oral consumption is also a comfortable and palatable
      delivery vehicle for introduction of the radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment compositions versus more invasive means. Forms
      of the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition for
      oral administration, either in pure or diluted form, include
      lacquered or coated tablets, unlacquered or uncoated tablets,
      caplets, hard capsules, liquid-filled capsules, hard gelatin
      capsule, hard vegetable-based capsule, elixir, soft-chew, lozenge,
      chewable bar, juice suspension, liquids, time-release
      formulations, and foodstuffs.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The daily dosage can be administered in the form of one or
      more capsules. The formulation of an individual capsule is
      determined based on the amount of the essential ingredients that
      are required to be present in each capsule to total the amount of
      essential ingredients. For simplicity, during the remaining
      portion of this description, the form of administration, whether
      lacquered tablets, unlacquered tablets, caplets, or capsules, will
      be referred to as "capsules" without distinguishing among the
      various forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] An example foodstuff that includes a daily dose of the
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition for oral
      administration comprises 0.024% of the micronutrient multivitamin
      and trace elements by total weight of the foodstuff and 0.023% of
      the antioxidant and chemopreventative agent mixture by total
      weight of the foodstuff, with the remainder of the foodstuff used
      for blending down the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] If a foodstuff or other material for oral consumption is
      used for administering the radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition, it is preferable that components of the
      foodstuff or other materials do not react with, interfere with the
      processing or absorption of, or negate the desirable properties of
      the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The entire daily dose of the radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition does not have to be administered in a single
      dose during a 24-hour period. The radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition sub-divided and proportionally administered
      more than once per day. The daily dose appropriately apportioned
      reflects the number of administrations to occur during the day.
      For example, it may be easier to administer the daily dose of
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition as three,
      one-third portions three times a day. In this example, tri-daily
      consumption of one-third portions of the radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment composition can occur with three regularly
      scheduled meals and effects the daily dose for the subject.
      Dividing the daily dose into smaller, more frequent
      administrations can improve the habit of self- administration,
      make it easier to audit to determine if proper dosage has
      occurred, and make the consumption of the radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment composition more tolerable to those with
      highly-sensitive taste. The sum of the proportional amounts of the
      administered composition during the 24-hour period should total
      the daily dose of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition
      mixtures can be administered separately to effect the proper daily
      dose of the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition.
      For example, the antioxidant and chemopreventative agent mixture
      can be provided for in separate capsules from the fatty acid
      mixture and the micronutrient multivitamin and trace element
      mixture. In another example, the antioxidant and chemopreventative
      agent mixture and the micronutrient multivitamin and trace
      elements mixture can be compounded together and the fatty acid
      mixture provided as a separate mixture. One of ordinary skill in
      the art can devise a variety of dosage schedules and partitions of
      the mixtures comprising the radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition to effect the proper administration of the
      daily dose.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition
      mixtures can be subdivided and proportionally administered during
      a 24-hour period to effect the proper daily dose of the radiation
      - oxidative exposure treatment composition. For example, the daily
      dose of the radiation - oxidative exposure treatment compositions
      can be administered through three capsules of a micronutrient
      multivitamin and trace elements, each capsule containing a third
      of the daily dose of the micronutrient multivitamin and trace
      elements mixture; three capsules of antioxidants and
      chemopreventative agents, each capsule containing a third of the
      daily dose of the antioxidant and chemopreventative agents
      mixture; and two soft liquid-filled capsules containing fatty
      acids, each containing half of the daily dose of the fatty acids.
      One of ordinary skill in the art can devise a variety of dosage
      schedules and partitions of the radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition mixtures to effect the proper administration
      of the daily dose. The sum of the proportional amounts of the
      administered mixture during the 24-hour period should total the
      daily dose of the mixture, and the sum of the proportional amounts
      of radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition should
      total the daily dose for the composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Research suggests that fat soluble antioxidants such as
      carotenoid lutein are best absorbed when combined with fat (e.g.,
      oils). The fatty acid mixture comprises molecularly distilled fish
      oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids, which also acts as a
      carrier and solubilizer for these carotenoids. This reduces the
      need to take the capsules with a fatty meal. Nevertheless, it is
      believed that combining the dose with the intake of a small meal
      containing a healthy portion of fat (i.e., olive oil, salmon, etc)
      may further help in the proper assimilation of the active
      components. It is preferable to avoid taking at the same time as
      foods rich in oxalic or phytic acid (e.g., raw beans, seeds,
      grains, soy, spinach, rhubarb), as they may depress the absorption
      of minerals like zinc; however, it is not necessary to avoid these
      foods for the composition to still be effective.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A delayed-release mechanism through enteric coating of soft
      liquid-filled capsules can be provided. Such a coating helps to
      reduce gastroesophageal reflux and fishy odor. The capsule can be
      coated in order to enhance the bioavailability of the dosage by
      maintaining the integrity of the fatty acids, minimizing their
      exposure to the gastric environment, and maximizing the capsule's
      disintegration upon its arrival at the duodenum.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The active ingredients of radiation - oxidative exposure
      treatment composition may be presented in a variety of forms.
      Additionally, the method of manufacturing may take a variety of
      forms and a number of inactive ingredients may be added to provide
      longer shelf life, to make the capsule more palatable or
      presentable, and to aid in the ease of manufacturing process. The
      capsules may be blended with any desired inactive ingredients, so
      long as the blend is uniform and the appropriate composition is
      reached for each capsule. The capsules may be coated or they can
      be contained in a carrier, such as mineral oil, to produce a soft
      gel.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The actual capsules containing parts or all of the
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition mixtures may
      contain somewhat more than the total amounts specified as the
      daily dose since the active ingredients may degrade over time.
      Consequently, in order to assure that the active ingredients are
      present in the minimum amounts required at the time the capsules
      are actually ingested, may require increasing the dosage beyond
      the minimum amounts required in order to account for and
      compensate for degradation over time. Some of the essential
      ingredients degrade faster than others, which can result in
      different percentages of excess in each capsule for one essential
      ingredient as compared to a different essential ingredient.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Prior animal-based studies also show that 7-10 days of oral
      administration of diets rich in antioxidants result in significant
      elevations in levels of micronutrients. Although not intending to
      be bound by theory, it is believed that administering radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment compositions on a continuing daily
      basis for at least 7-10 days before exposure to a radiation source
      maximizes the concentration of beneficial components for radiation
      exposure treatment in the subject at the time of radiation
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Animal-based studies also suggest that administration of
      combinations of vitamins, trace elements, non-essential natural
      antioxidants, and chemopreventative agents during and after
      exposure to a radiation source provides a source of continual
      antioxidant bioavailability that improves both acute as well as
      long-term survival due to the reduction in radiation-induced life
      shortening caused by total-body irradiation. Although not
      intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that this effect
      also works for oxidative stress-induced damage. The period for
      continuing daily administration of the daily dose of radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment compositions can be in a range of
      from about 1 day after exposure to the end of the subject's
      lifespan. The experiment shows beneficial administration of a
      radiation - oxidative exposure treatment composition for up to 450
      days.<br>
      <br>
      [00100] Experimental models demonstrate the use of radiation -
      oxidative exposure treatment compositions in ameliorating the
      acute effects of radiation. These models show strongly imply that
      the long-term effects are transferable to other animal species,
      including other mammals, and especially to humans (homo sapiens).<br>
      <br>
      [00101] Methods of pre- or post-exposure treatment can include the
      additional step of administering manganese superoxide dismutase
      plasmid DNA in liposome (MnSOD-PL) gene product intravenously in
      conjunction with receiving daily doses of radiation - oxidative
      exposure treatment compositions. The additional step can further
      decrease radiation-induced cellular apoptosis, tissue injury, and
      improve the survival rate in organ- specific and total-
      body-irradiated rodents.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] Administration of a MnSOD-PL injection at least 24 hours
      prior to total-body irradiation not only improves survival from
      the LD50 dose of 9.5 Gy in C57BL/6HNsd mice but also ameliorates
      the late radiation-induced life shortening in male mice. Radiation
      - oxidative exposure treatment compositions also improves the
      long-term survival rate in acutely irradiated mice by reducing
      radiation-induced life shortening effects.<br>
      <br>
      [00103] Intravenous injection of MnSOD-PL (at a dilution of 100
      [mu]g of plasmid DNA to 100 [mu]L. of liposomes) gene product at
      least about 24 hours before irradiation can provide some
      protective benefit. The injection amount is about 0.004 grams
      plasmid DNA per kilogram subject body weight.<br>
      <br>
      [00104] Test mice receiving a MnSOD-PL injection prior to
      irradiation and demonstrating improved survival after the LD50/30
      dose also show amelioration of radiation- induced late effects.
      Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that
      these results are attributable to a decrease in radiation-induced
      aging in a non-specific sense rather than a decrease in the
      frequency or type of radiation-induced tumors or evidence of
      neurodegenerative disease. Since radiation-induced life shortening
      associates with biomarkers of aging, including fur graying in
      rodent models, organ failure, osteoporosis and fibrosis, many
      animals in these prior studies do not show specific causes of
      death. Additionally, prior studies indicate antioxidant MnSOD-PL
      treatment does not increase tumor frequency or lethality.<br>
      <br>
      [00105] Examples of specific embodiments facilitate a better
      understanding of radiation - oxidative exposure treatment
      compositions and their use in ameliorating radiation- induced life
      shortening effects after exposure to a radiation source. In no way
      should the Examples limit or define the scope of the invention.<br>

      [00106] The mammal models are 160 female C57BL/6NHsd mice, aged 8
      weeks. There are four groups of 40 mice each. Each mouse weighs
      approximately 22.5 grams.<br>
      <br>
      [00107] The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and
      Use Committee approves all experimental protocols. The University
      of Pittsburgh Division of Laboratory Animal Research provides
      veterinary care. The model animals are C57BL/6HNsd female mice.
      Each cage houses five mice during the study. Maintenance and
      housing of the mice occurs according to the protocols of The
      University of Pittsburgh Division of Laboratory Animal Research.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Protocols</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00108] For the experiment, an "experimental" chow mix with
      dietary supplements sustains two of the four groups of 40 mice.
      The diet of chow mix in combination with the dietary supplement
      sustains these two groups from 7 days before the before
      irradiation until conclusion of the experiment. A "house" chow mix
      maintains the other two groups of 40 mice for the same period for
      control purposes. The chow portion per mouse per day is 5,000 mg.<br>
      <br>
      [00109] The base chow mix is "Lab Diet rMH 3000 (5P00)" (Cat. No.
      1812877) from TESTDIET (Richmond, Indiana).<br>
      <br>
      [00110] The house chow mix comprises 0.12% hydrogen silicon
      dioxide by total weight of the house chow mix and the remainder is
      base chow mix. The silicon dioxide, which is inert and not harmful
      to the mice, compensates for any potential changes in the weight
      of the mice due to the addition of the dietary supplement. <br>
      <br>
      [00111] Table 7 shows the constituents of both the first dietary
      supplement mixture comprising micronutrient vitamins and trace
      elements and the second dietary supplement mixture comprising
      non-essential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents.
      AmeriSciences LP (Houston, Texas) supplies the first dietary
      supplement mixture as "AmeriSciences/NASA Premium Multivitamin
      Premix". AmeriSciences LP also supplies the second dietary
      supplement mixture as "AmeriSciences/NASA Fruit and Veggie
      Antioxidant Formula Premix".<br>
      <br>
      [00112] Units of measure for Tables 7 includes "IU", which
      represents "International Units", an understood metric in the art
      for measuring the active amount of particular species, especially
      vitamins (e.g., Vitamins A, D, and E). Milligrams ("mg") are
      1x10-3 grams. Micrograms C^g") are 1x10-6 grams.<br>

      [00114] The experimental chow mix that sustains the other two
      groups of 40 mice includes both the first and second dietary
      supplement mixtures with the base chow mix. The experimental chow
      mix comprises 0.024% "AmeriSciences/NASA Premium Multivitamin

      "AmeriSciences/NASA Fruit/Veggie Antioxidant Formula" by total

      day of AmeriSciences/NASA Fruit Veggie Antioxidant Formula. Based
      upon an average weight per mouse of 22.5 grams, each mouse ingests

      [00115] There are no other additional ingredients for either the

      [00116] Intravenous injection of MnSOD-PL (100 [mu]g of plasmid
      DNA in 100 [mu][Epsilon] of liposomes) gene product occurs about
      24 hours before irradiation into one of the two experimental chow
      mix diet groups (40 mice) and into one of the two house chow mix
      diet groups (40 mice) according to methods known in the art. Given
      the average weight of a mouse in the experiment is 22.5 grams, the
      injection amount is about 0.004 grams plasmid DNA per kilogram
      subject bodyweight. The feed schedule and mixes for both groups
      remains unchanged.<br>

      [00117] A J.L. Shepherd Mark I cesium irradiator exposes all
      models to a 9.5 Gy total- body radiation dose at a rate of 70
      cGy/min 24 hours after the two MnSOD-PL injected mice receive
      their injections and after 7 days of feeding with either the house
      or experimental chow mixes. "Gy" is a gray, which is the
      absorption of one joule of ionizing radiation by one kilogram of
      matter. Statistical Evaluation of Experimental Models<br>
      <br>
      [00118] Evaluations of the models are for survival, overall
      survival and conditional survival. "Overall survival" is the time
      from the date of irradiation to the date of expiration for any
      model under study. "Conditional survival" is the time from the
      date of irradiation to the date of expiration for all mice that
      survive 31 days or longer after irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [00119] The two-sided Fisher's exact test compares model 30-day
      mortality between any two different diet and injection status
      groups. The two-sided log-rank test compares two different diet
      and injection status groups having models surviving 31 days or
      longer. Comparative P-values of less than 0.050 are significant.

      [00120] Mice on the house chow diet compared to experimental chow
      diet did not show any differences in body weight over the 450-day
      post-irradiation period. This indicates that the experimental chow
      diet containing the micronutrient vitamins, trace element,
      nonessential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agent diet
      is similarly palatable to the mice as the house chow.<br>

      for the members of the four model groups in the experiment. In no
      way should either Figure 1 or 2 limit or define the scope of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [00123] Figure 1 is a graph showing percentage overall survival of
      the members of four model groups receiving 9.5 Gy of radiation for
      the period of 450 days after initial exposure. Figure 2 is a graph
      showing percentage condition survival of the members of the four
      model groups after receiving 9.5 Gy of radiation during the period
      of 30 days from initial exposure to 450 days after initial
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MnSOD-PL Administration Improves Survival after LD50/30
        Total-Body Irradiation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00124] Table 8 indicates that mice receiving intravenous
      administration of MnSOD- PL gene product show improved survival
      compared to mice in the control group (house chow diet) after 9.5
      Gy TBI exposure. The data in Table 8 confirms and demonstrates
      decreased 30-day mortality in the MnSOD-PL gene product
      injection/house chow group compared to the no injection/house chow
      control: 20% mortality in the MnSOD-PL group compared 45% in the
      control (P = 0.031). Figure 1 also shows this increased survival
      rate from the acute exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [00125] Table 8 shows mice receiving the no injection/experimental
      chow diet did not show an improvement in survival up to the thirty
      day mark, having a mortality of 50%, compared to 45% for the no
      injection/house chow control (P = 0.82).<br>
      <br>
      [00126] Thirty-day mortality is significantly lower in MnSOD-PL
      gene product injection/experimental chow group compared to the no
      injection/house chow control and no injection/experimental chow
      diet: 17.5% for the antioxidant diet + MnSOD-PL group compared to
      45% mortality in no injection/house chow control and 50% in the no
      injection/experimental chow diet (P = 0.015 and 0.004,
      respectively). These results establish that the experimental chow,
      which contains the first and second dietary supplement mixtures,
      does not negatively affect the radio-protective effect of MnSOD-PL
      gene product against total-body irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antioxidant Diet Improves Conditional Survival and Ameliorates
        Radiation-Induced Life Shortening</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00127] Evaluation for late effects of radiation (conditional
      survival) occurs for mice surviving beyond 30 days after
      irradiation. Figure 2 and Table 8 shows that the conditional
      survival of mice on the experimental chow diet significantly
      improves over the remainder of the 450 days of observation period
      compared to that of those on the house chow diet control group (P
      = 0.040). Mice on the house chow diet also receiving the MnSOD-PL
      gene product injection show improvement in conditional survival
      rates compared to the house chow diet control group with no
      injection (P = 0.020). The MnSOD-PL gene product
      injection/experimental chow group also show improvement in
      conditional survival compared to the no injection/house chow diet
      control (P = 0.010). There is no significant difference in
      conditional survival between the MnSOD-PL gene product
      injection/experimental chow group and both the MnSOD-PL gene
      product injection/house chow group or no injection/experimental
      chow diet group.<br>
      <br>
      [00128] Among the irradiated mice surviving 31 days or longer,
      Table 8 shows the conditional median survival time is 213 days for
      the no injection/house chow diet controls, 328 days for the
      MnSOD-PL gene product injection/house chow group, 309.5 days for
      the no injection/experimental chow group, and 322 days for the
      MnSOD-PL gene product injection/experimental chow group.<br>
      <br>
      [00129] The conditional survival results establish that the
      supplement mixture comprising micronutrient vitamins and trace
      elements and the supplement mixture comprising non-essential
      natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents ameliorate
      radiation-induced life shortening. The results support the concept
      of abating continuing oxidative stress in the post-irradiation
      cellular microenvironment of tissues, organs and organ systems
      with mixtures of micronutrient vitamins and trace elements,
      non-essential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents.<br>
      <br>
      [00130] The experiment shows the composition comprising the
      micronutrient vitamins, trace elements, non-essential natural
      antioxidants and chemoprevention agents improves conditional
      survival in total-body-irradiated female mice. A significant
      therapeutic effect of the experimental chow diet is in conditional
      survival. In animals surviving the acute effects of radiation, the
      diet containing the micronutrient vitamins, trace elements,
      non-essential natural antioxidants and chemoprevention agents
      ameliorates radiation-induced life shortening.<br>

      [00131] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that
      each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower
      limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the
      upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or
      intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the
      invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may
      independently be included in the smaller ranges is also
      encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically
      excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range
      includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or
      both of those included limits are also included in the invention.<br>
