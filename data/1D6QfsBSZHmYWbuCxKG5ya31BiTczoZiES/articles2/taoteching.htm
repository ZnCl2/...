          <p align="left">I<font size="-1">T</font> is only after some
            years of hesitation that I have undertaken a new version of
            the Tao Tê Ching. The task has already been performed by
            Julien, Chalmers, Strauss, Plänckner, and Legge, most of
            whom, at any rate, are scholars of the first water. But it
            occurs to me — and with all deference I make the avowal—that
            one prime defect lies at the root of every translation that
            has been published hitherto; and this is, that not one seems
            to have been based solely and entirely on commentaries
            furnished by members of the Taoist school. The Confucian
            element enters largely into all; and here, I think, an
            injustice has been done to Lao Tsze. To a Confucianist, the
            Taoist system is in every sense of the word a heresy, and a
            commentator holding this opinion is surely not the best
            expositor. It is as a grammarian rather than as a
            philosopher that a member of the Ju-chia deals with the Tao
            Tê Ching; he gives the sense of a passage according to the
            syntactical construction rather than according to the genius
            of the philosophy itself; and in attempting to explain the
            text by his own canons instead of by the canons of Taoism,
            he mistakes the superficial and apparently obvious meaning
            for the hidden and esoteric interpretation. One of the
            greatest reproaches levelled at the Taoist system by
            Confucian scholars is the alleged scorn of ethical morality
            attributed to Lao Tsze and his followers. They have been
            represented as ascribing all the troubles and vices of China
            to the example of Yao and Shun, and to the doctrines
            respecting benevolence, rectitude, ceremonies, and music
            enforced by the Sages who immediately succeeded them. Lü
            Tsu, in his commentary, vehemently controverts this theory,
            and strives to prove, not only that Taoism and Confucianism
            are at one upon such points, but that <i>the latter is
              actually based upon the former </i>— being a mere
            carrying-out in practice, a careful systematising, as it
            were, of the radical doctrines of Lao Chün. The fact that I
            have entirely discarded all assistance from commentators of
            the Confucian school is my only excuse for coming forward
            with a new translation of this important classic. The
            version now presented is based solely upon the commentaries
            of Lü Ch‘un-yang, commonly called Lü Tsu, the well-known
            Taoist patriarch of the eighth century of our era; and his
            guidance I have followed throughout. I candidly admit that
            this has not been done without some effort. It was no means
            easy, at first, to reject what appeared&nbsp; to be the
            plain, clear, unmistakeable meaning of the text—a meaning,
            too, endorsed by many eminent Chinese scholars, such as Chu
            Hsi, Liu Chieh-fu, Wang Pi, and Su Tsze-yu, and adopted by
            Legge, Julien, and Chalmers—in favour of an interpretation
            at once far-fetched and obscure. But I felt that I was after
            all under the guidance of a disciple, and not a critic, of
            the Master; and although many passages which before stood
            out distinctly enough are now dimmed by mysticism, I cannot
            help thinking that we have advanced a step towards the
            comprehension of their true significance. There are other
            passages the existing translations of which, apart from
            questions of commentary, I believe to be entirely, and
            indeed palpably, wrong, and of these I now offer a new
            rendering with confidence. The versions of Julien and
            Chalmers have lain beside me, and I have constantly referred
            to them; but far from relying on them for assistance, each
            glance has shown me how wide and radical was the divergence
            between them and the work growing slowly but steadily under
            my hand. </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; I need only add that the words
            enclosed in brackets [thus] are for the most part
            representative of the commentary I have followed, and thus
            serve to supplement the meagre and laconic text.

            robbers; by closing his eyes to objects of desire, he
            secures his heart from corruption. Wherefore the Sage, in
            governing, does so with a heart empty , but a bosom
            full&nbsp; ; he makes his will pliant, his bodily frame-work
            firm; he ever keeps the people from [harmful] knowledge and
            desires, and prevents those who have such knowledge from
            daring to put it into practice. He pursues a policy of
            inaction, and there is therefore nothing that is left

            radiance ; and it identifies itself with the sordid ones of
            the earth . Pellucid it yet has the semblance of permanence.

          <p align="left">&nbsp; The space between Heaven and Earth may

            imitation of them] regards the cultivation of his body as of
            secondary importance, his body still progresses [of its own
            accord]; he discards his body, and yet his body is

            Wherever it dwells, it sanctifies the spot. In the heart,
            its sanctifying properties are unfathomable. In bestowing,

            ability; in the adoption of public measures it sanctifies

            occupies the left-hand position [in the war-chariot]; it is
            the general-in-chief who is stationed on the right. The
            meaning of this is that the latter is placed similarly to a
            chief mourner at a funeral — <i>q.d.</i>, in an
            inauspicious position. Having been instrumental in killing
            multitudes of people, he should weep bitterly with pity and

          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; To carry out this doctrine to the

            temperance that one may be said to submit betimes to T<font

            accumulation of virtue. When virtue is thus heavily
            accumulated there is nothing to which the man is inadequate;
            when there is nothing to which a man is inadequate, it is

            gains its allegiance; and a small State, by bearing itself
            humbly towards a great State, may obtain possession of it.

            itself take . </p>

            bestow on those who have a superfluity. Who is able to
            devote his surplus to the needs of others? — Only he who is
            possessed of T<font size="-1">AO</font>.<br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">Thus it is that the Sage acts, yet does not
            plume himself; achieves works of merit, yet does not hold to
            them. He has no wish to make a display of his worthiness. </p>

          <p align="left">There is nothing under Heaven that is weaker
            or softer than water; yet those who attack what is hard and
            strong are not aware that it is that which can overcome it.
            They do not see that, their task is an easy one. </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that weakness overcomes
            strength, that the soft overcomes the hard, is unknown to
            none; yet they cannot act upon it. </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the Sage says: He who
            bears the reproach of the State may be called lord of the
            nation's altars; he who bears the calamities of the State
            may be called the King of the world. These are true words,
            though apparently at variance ; <i>i.e.</i>, paradoxical. </p>

          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; When peace is made after a great
            quarrel, there is always a feeling of resentment left
            behind. How can this be regarded as right? </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore the Sage, unwilling to
            shift responsibility upon others, keeps, on his left hand,
            an officer to make record . The virtuous man keeps a record
            of his compacts; the unprincipled man repudiates them. </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; The T<font size="-1">AO</font> of
            Heaven has no favourites; its practice is simply to reward
            the virtuous. </p>

          <p align="left">With a small State, sparsely populated,
            supposing that I had weapons for a thousand men, I would not
            use them. <br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">I would rather teach my subjects to think
            seriously of death, and not to emigrate to a distance. <br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">Then, though they might have ships and
            chariots, nobody would mount them; though they might have
            armour and weapons, nobody would set them in array.<br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">I would make them return to the use of the
            quipu, render their food toothsome, beautify their clothes ,
            live tranquilly at home, be happy in their domestic usages,
            keep watch with neighbouring states for their mutual safety,
            and let the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs be heard by
            one another . <br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">Thus the people would die of old age without
            ever coming into collision with each other. </p>

            Pleasant, or specious, words are not faithful. </p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtuous do not bandy
            arguments. Those who bandy arguments are not virtuous. The

          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sage does not lay up hidden
            stores. The more he employs it on behalf of others the more
            he has for himself. The more he imparts to others, the more
            his own stores increase. </p>
