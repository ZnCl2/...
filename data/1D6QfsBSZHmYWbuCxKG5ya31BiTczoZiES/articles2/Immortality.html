            Words</b></big><br>
        <b>by&nbsp;</b><b>Leonard Orr</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A mind expanded by a new idea can never return to its former size.
      Two common words in everyone’s vocabulary when combined into one
      idea become one of the most powerful ideas in the universe.
      Physical is a very common word. Immortality is also a common word.
      When you combine them, you get the idea of physical immortality.
      I’ve been exposing people to the idea of physical immortality for
      over 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      Physical immortality means victory over physical death. It means
      body and mind mastery. Our Spirit is already an immortal master.
      This simple thought of physical immortality makes us realize that
      although death may be popular, it is not inevitable. Physical
      death is optional. The whole purpose of Jesus Christ was to teach
      us this. But Jesus was not the first nor the last human to conquer
      death. The Hebrew Bible is about five main immortal humans:
      Elijah, Moses, Melchizadek, and Enoch. In the beginning of Bible
      history, everyone lived 500 to 1000 years. India has its immortal
      yogis. Every continent has its favorite immortals, including
      native Americans. I’ve made this one of my favorite research
      projects for 37 years. Why do Christians die? Why? If Jesus died
      to save us from sin and death?<br>
      <br>
      The founders and heroes and heroines of most religions who
      conquered death do not have a local address on planet Earth. When
      I learned about the immortal yogis who do, I was so excited I
      couldn’t wait to meet them. Since my first trip to India in 1977,
      I have met over 8 immortals who each have maintained their body
      for at least 300 years. People have to be at least 300 to qualify
      for my research. I know of many more that I haven’t had a chance
      to meet yet.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve met several who are over 2000. These are yogis who have
      maintained a local address on planet Earth for over 2000 years.
      I’ve written books about two of them: Babaji and Bhartriji. People
      often tell me that after my lecture or book in which the idea of
      physical immortality got their attention, they couldn’t stop
      thinking about it for several years. It makes so much sense. How
      could people be blinded by the death is inevitable belief system
      for so long?<br>
      <br>
      After teaching the truth about physical immortality for over 30
      years, I’ve concluded that the reason people don’t like to know
      about it is because it I involves a little spiritual work and
      personal changes. Physical immortality is the natural result of a
      mind filled with wisdom and aliveness.<br>
      <br>
      The three basic causes of death are:<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp; ignorance<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; emotional energy pollution<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; poor diet.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, to master death you have to do three things:<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Master the idea of physical immortality, which
      involves living from Spirit, our natural divinity.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unravel our own death urge, which we received from
      our parents and encourage all the people in our environment to do
      the same. Learn how to keep our energy body &amp; emotional mind
      clean and balanced through spiritual purification practices.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn the power of nutrition and fasting and the
      other simple and pleasurable habits that give us body mastery.
      Becoming a vegetarian is basic!<br>
      <br>
      Mastering spiritual practices is less difficult than living a
      miserable life that leads to the grave. In fact, true spiritual
      practices are the ultimate pleasures and enrich all the pleasures
      of living. As I studied the lives of my immortal yogi friends, I
      began to realize that becoming an immortal yogi is not difficult;
      it just takes a different focus. People die because they kill
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest enemy of mankind has been and always will be
      ignorance. And the most evil form of ignorance is
      self-righteousness – thinking we know enough. Self-righteous
      people are murdering their own natural divinity and are guilty of
      murdering the natural divinity of everyone around them. It is the
      sin of eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and naturally
      yields the personal doom of death. The Bible says, “God is not
      willing for any to perish, but that all should come to a knowledge
      of repentance.” Repentance means to change our mind. Repentance is
      neither difficult nor unpleasurable. In fact, it is exciting,
      inspiring, and produces pleasure, bliss, and ecstasy. If God made
      the path to eternal life difficult, He/She would be a sadist Who
      has doomed us to eternal misery. The only thing difficult about it
      is giving up your addiction to misery. Changing gives us the
      immense satisfaction of accomplishment.<br>
      <br>
      Simple spiritual purification practices like bathing twice per
      day, conscious energy breathing, fire purification, an exercise
      system, a conscious diet, loving relationships, and mastering a
      mantra are the basic common denominators of the lifestyle of all
      the immortal masters I have met. These spiritual practices with
      earth, air, water, and fire can clean the mind faster than the
      mind can clean the mind. They are healing magic. In the process of
      mastering these, we must develop a balance between solitude and
      service.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve written many books about physical immortality and the
      practical principles of conquering death and I recommend that you
      read them all and use my tapes repetitively if you are interested
      in personal mastery. But every year I try to put this simple truth
      into one page, in a clearer and easier way for people to
      understand.<br>
      <br>
      Anyone can read or have read to them one page and have their mind
      expanded to receive the joy that this great idea brings. It
      unshackles your creativity and releases enormous reserves of
      energy and intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      Is physical immortality realistic? Yes, if we honor the following.
      The three basic secrets to physical immortality are:<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp; to stay tuned into God – Infinite Energy, our
      Source – all the time. Have pure thoughts and Life.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; to heal the death urge. Healing the death urge can
      take us through the most ugly emotions of suicidal and homicidal
      thoughts – we have to survive the illusions in our own mind and go
      for wisdom and bliss.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep our energy body clean and balanced with the
      simple and pleasurable spiritual purification practices with mind,
      earth, air, water, fire, and love.<br>
      <br>
      When we eat food we have to clean the dishes, etc. When our home
      gets dirty, we have to clean it. We also have to wash our clothes.
      When our energy body (also called emotional body) gets dirty
      through absorbing emotional energy pollution as we participate
      with people or in our self-healing process, we have to clean
      ourselves emotionally and spiritually. It is a daily process.
      Spiritual cleanliness is Energy and Peace.<br>
      <br>
      If we stay ahead of the pollution – cleansing process, we become
      more alive every day. If we lose the spiritual purification game,
      we become more dead every day. Victory or victim?<br>
      <br>
      One of the indicators is the guru belly phenomena. The solar
      plexus chakra is the social chakra and emotional energy pollution
      can be collected physically in the form of fat around the navel –
      it is sometimes called psychic fat.<br>
      <br>
      Another indicator is stiffness. An over loaded body gets stiffer
      and stiffer every day and every year until we become a stiff – and
      are buried. When we absorb other people’s death urge, we can get
      depressed, feel suicidal, become prone to anger, be grouchy, or
      have violent dreams. Victim consciousness in all its forms is a
      sign of death urge.<br>
      <br>
      I’ll finish this page with an idea which is a million times
      greater than physical immortality, and is the source of personal
      mastery or misery and death. It is this: ‘Energy becomes what it
      thinks about’. Your personal energy is the Eternal Spirit – God
      Within – your natural divinity.<br>
      <br>
      This Infinite Eternal Energy is helpless and powerless without
      thought and yet it is the power of thought. Your unlimited
      potential is only potential until it has been activated and
      directed by your thoughts. Energy is directed by thought.<br>
      <br>
      Infinite Power directed by thoughts of weakness can produce
      infinite weakness. Infinite power directed by wholesome and
      healthy thoughts produce infinite wholesomeness, health, and
      safety – beyond safety – peace and pleasure. Thoughts of death
      produce death. Thoughts of Eternal Life produce physical
      immortality and body mastery. The body is Energy materialized by
      thought; not passive thinking, but active thinking; thought in
      motion. Your physical body and emotional body have been built up
      by millions of thoughts in action. To be a master, you now have to
      catch the thoughts and change them with the kind of actions that
      produce the results you like. We are all scientists and our body
      is the laboratory. Various nutrients have been created by thinking
      beings to produce certain effects in the body. Some of these cause
      and effect relationships are simple and some are quite complex.
      And simple fasting is the direct route to the purity of Infinite
      Energy. However, it is also possible to starve to death for
      spiritual purposes. We have to learn balance and common sense.
      More people die from overeating today than from starvation.<br>
      <br>
      Repentance is fun! Changing our minds is the great, eternal
      adventure of all intelligent divine beings.<br>
      <br>
      Playing in your Spirit Energy, your Divine Mind, and your
      Infinitely Beautiful Body is what Eternal Life is all about.<br>
      <br>
      Have fun!<br>

        <b>ULTIMATE CYBER SECURITY SWITCH, 9/11-EQUIVALENT EVENT-PROOF
          SWITCH, AND OTHERS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor: WU WEIMIN [CA] &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Ever since the inception of internet, hackers from different
      countries have been successfully defeating many governments and
      more than 70 corporations around the world in cyber warfare: as,
      the USA, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and many others
      according to the news broadcasted by CNN, CBC, etc. All their
      helpless and unstoppable defeats only root in their lack of one of
      my inventions titled: Ultimate Cyber Security Switch. Only this
      invention is qualified to defeat all individual and
      government-sponsored hackers by preventing and stopping them from
      hacking into any cyberspace that is protected by this invention.
      Therefore, this invention can save all these losing countries
      billions if not trillions of US dollars each and every year of
      losses from intellectual properties, military intelligence,
      economic intelligence, financial information, etc. And since many
      ages ago, people have been mining gold with wash plant, panning,
      etc hoping and fantasizing becoming rich. But existing sluice and
      riffle systems are simply too inefficient with a lot of gold loss
      through the sluice and riffle systems. Hence, I have invented a
      series of revolutionary gold mining equipments and processes to
      expedite gold production yet minimize loss. Moreover, the Law of
      No Largest, or Smallest, or Any Other Absolute Limit established
      by me states that throughout the universe nothing can be the
      smallest or the largest. There is never either upper or lower
      physical limit to anything throughout the universe. There is
      perpetually something smaller than the smallest particle that can
      ever be found; there likewise is perpetual something larger than
      the largest expanse that can ever be found. Therefore, Higgs Boson
      (or God particle) sought in the Hadron Collider in Switzerland, or
      any other so-called particle can never ever be the smallest
      particle because there perpetually is something even smaller than
      the smallest particle that can ever be found according to this
      Law. The Law of Time Delusion established by me states that in
      fact time is but a delusion because there is no reality in any
      time. It is only because time is but a delusion that other animals
      live in perpetual non relativity with no concept or sense of time.
      And it is also only because time is but a delusion that the
      selfsame number of hours or any other periods of time to the
      selfsame person are felt and perceived completely different
      whenever and if he or she falls asleep and whenever and if he or
      she fells anxious. And it is also only because time is but a
      delusion different people can agree on an arbitrarily set or
      assigned time. Albert Einstein and a plethora of other scientists
      are absolutely wrong about the nature of time. Because time is but
      a delusion, any attempt to seek any form of time travel is
      foolishness, failure, and waste of life in the making. Time
      travel, such as Einstein's Rosen Bridge, wormhole, Higgs singlet,
      time travel portal, or any other form of time manipulation is
      absolutely impossible though people can always so fantasize, just
      as a lot of people would always waste lives fantasizing
      immortality though it is impossible. It is likely foolish for
      anyone to believe that Nazi Bell could somehow manipulate time by
      spinning red mercury, etc because time is but a delusion. The Law
      of Inevitable Randomness establish by me states that only by
      involving randomness in one way or another rather than regulated
      or calibrated actions and/or processes any ultimate state can be
      attained. For example, in order to polish any mirror to its
      ultimate resolution possible, random polishing process must be
      implemented. To expand this law to other area, according this law
      Albert Einstein's Spooking Communication Theory is also a fraud
      because it is but random coincidence by which two distant objects
      sometimes exhibit entanglements, same behaviors, etc, not any
      dictating law or regularity. But Einstein had mistaken the random
      coincidence between two distance objects for the act of law or
      regularity. Furthermore, ultimately on the one hand anything must
      encompass an element of randomness; on the other hand, only
      randomness can cause anything or state to achieve the culmination
      of that thing, much as only hand-polished or
      random-action-polished lens can attain the ultimate precision of
      their size. And then the Law of Uniqueness likewise established by
      me states that, at the level tending to either infinite large or
      small and no matter how adamantly a person desires otherwise,
      everything throughout the universe must be and can only be unique;
      therefore, there cannot be another planet or any other heavenly
      body like the Earth which sustains life. Therefore, there has
      never been, and never is, and will never be any life anywhere
      throughout the entire universe. The Law of Uncertainty also
      established by me states that there perpetually exists an element
      of uncertainty in all human affairs (especially whenever and if
      great interest becomes at stake), any phenomenon, and any
      existence. For example, albeit Popes have always done their best
      to conceal their secrets from their donors for decades, these laws
      had recently dictated a unique butler of one of the Popes to have
      just divulged only few unimportant Vatican secrets against all
      their ardent desires to hide the truth from the donors,
      supporters, and followers. Ever since the split second on such a
      birthday when the human species had emerged onto Earth, people
      have killed and harmed one another to establish empires, wealth,
      power, predominance, social strata, fame, successes, etc for
      selfish aggrandizement; but none of such lifetime have been wisely
      spent because all conquerors and/or winners have died, much as all
      ordinary people and losers do. Therefore, all their cunning,
      brutal, and hell-for-leather rampages, campaigns, maneuvers,
      intrigues, duplicities, chicaneries, deceptions, etc eventually
      have been but foolish dissipations of lifespan in vain at the
      pursuing for any thing but that which can last. And furthermore,
      billions of innocent people have already been defrauded, deceived,
      brainwashed, victimized, and/or inflicted in respect to the
      authentic and genuine truth and true reality of universe
      containing life, mind, and other existences. Even as recent as
      December 2012, delusional faiths in the country of India of
      multiple dysfunctional faiths had driven many Indian men into
      gang-raping and/or murdering women in their country in the most
      uncivilized manner. All people's all uncivilized conducts and
      inner sufferings can only ultimately root in delusional faiths
      because only their deceptive faiths, beliefs, and hence mindsets
      drive them into their behaviors and then foolish ways of life.
      Their faiths are delusional and hence they are dysfunctional
      because the ultimate faith always functions. All conventional
      faiths/belief systems have always been predicated on the
      diffusions of lies, frauds, deceits, misinformation, deceptions,
      and brainwashing that are devised to batten on, defraud, and abuse
      their parishioners, other followers, and their innocent children.
      Had these inventions not come to fruition, and so long as the
      human race can still endure the living conditions on this planet,
      people will continue enduring countless faith predators that will
      continue defrauding, brainwashing, victimizing billions of faith
      victims, as since the emergence of humankind on this planet they
      have always battened on their faith victims throughout the world
      and even have sexually exploited/molested the innocent children of
      their faith victims in none other than the places of worship. The
      places of worship are also sometimes used as their bases for other
      crime: as, some faith predators have actually been charged for
      selling child pornography, etc in none other than the places of
      worship. Therefore, these inventions are of unprecedented and
      historic significance, practicality, and value since they qualify
      to prevent future billions of innocent human beings from
      continuously being defrauded, brainwashed, victimized, and/or
      harmed by faith predators with their delusional faiths, and they
      revolutionize and upgrade the vision, sphere, and capability of
      the humanity. My qualification cannot manifest it clearer to me
      that the effective ways and strategies to prevent or reduce the
      sufferings of innocent lives from continuing being misled,
      brainwashed, victimized, and/or harmed are to live the correct
      faiththe correct belief system. As a member of true integrity and
      righteousness of the human species and we are stumbling across one
      another on the universal yet against-our-will-journey of aging
      towards inevitable death instincts, I am behooved and honor-bound
      to provide the humankind with these inventions to upgrade human
      knowledge so as to dispel the worldwide spiritual plague and
      precipices of delusional faiths, misled beliefs, misled
      perceptions, misled preconceptions, misled information, misled
      knowledge, misled science, etc that have been deluding,
      victimizing, and/or afflicting the humanity since its emergency
      tens of thousands of years ago. Only in so doing, said deceits,
      frauds, whoppers, delusions, etc against humankind can be so
      lifted and dispelled that mankind will no longer suffer in
      ignorance, delusion, deceit, pseudo-science, etc. Only the correct
      knowledge, insight, and faith about mind, life, and universe can
      be qualified, on all terms for anyone, to harness and/or
      manifestto the ultimate maximathe human potential of the mind
      and/or the body; otherwise, all talents, knowledge, knowing,
      faculties, etc are perpetually limited and confined within the
      spheres of apparent reality without ever becoming qualified to be
      expanded to, upgraded into, or evolved into true reality
      transcending apparent reality. Only by living true reality guided
      by the ultimate faith (the truly correct and hence functioning
      faith/belief system) anyone can become qualified for life to enjoy
      mind freedom including emotional freedom, etc and
      omniscience...&nbsp; &amp;c &amp;c<br>

      Inventor: WEN DONG &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The invention provides a method for achieving immortality and even
      achieving rejuvenescence by humans. The method is mainly composed
      of a human aging theory and a part about how to preventing human
      aging. The method is characterized in that when a human body
      sweats by a great amount, edible rice vinegar is sprayed all over
      the human body to enable pores all over the body to absorb the
      rice vinegar into the human body. After entering the human body,
      the rice vinegar can prevent most inorganic salts in the human
      body from generating precipitates and even dissolve inorganic
      salts which are already precipitated and include calcium oxalate,
      calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and the like in the body. The
      specific weight of the inorganic salts in the human body in the
      human body is reduced through dissolving of parts of the inorganic
      salts in the human body and exhausting the parts of the inorganic
      salts out of the human body so as to prevent aging. The method of
      spraying rice vinegar on the human body has the advantages of
      being small in toxic and side effects of rice vinegar, low in
      cost, favorable for popularization, easy to operate, free of
      training, strong in controllability, and capable of increasing and
      decreasing the spraying times and the concentration of the rice
      vinegar for adjustment according to needs.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      Biological theory of aging and how to prevent biological aging
      process of the present invention patent relates.<br>
      <br>
      [0002]<br>
      In the scientific community there are two theories of biological
      aging: one for congenital doctrine, they think the gene is a key
      factor in the decision to biological aging, so they stepped up to
      crack the genetic code.<br>
      Another theory that biological aging postnatal environment is a
      key factor in the decision.<br>
      I support the latter theory, following talk about my reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0003]<br>
      Many biological phenomena acquired environmental biological
      explanation is the main factor in determining the biological
      aging, but with the gene theory is difficult to make sense.<br>
      Illustration: ? Scientists have done experiments with rats,
      scientists fed mice by strictly controlling the amount of food,
      can significantly improve the lives of mice; ? millennium water
      lily seeds can still grow after germination millennium; ? the
      nature of the worker bees and the queen are the same Eggs females,
      almost similar gene, and because they eat different food, their
      life can vary several times as much, eat royal jelly queen bee,
      worker bees eat honey; ? biosphere has immortality phenomena, such
      as scientists are Research by the division of reproductive sector
      insects and other genes in the same situation, you can go on
      unlimited split.<br>
      <br>
      [0004]<br>
      By summarizing many biological phenomena, we find that the
      metabolism of biological aging is caused by the main reason, does
      not participate in the metabolism of the organism does not occur
      aging, such as water lily seeds did not sprout before aging.<br>
      We believe that the organisms absorb nutrients from the outside
      world during the same time inhale a possible biological aging
      substance, it is an increase in the accumulation of such
      substances, resulting in a biological aging and even death.<br>
      Death from natural biological aging and biological aging should
      not be reversed.<br>
      I infer that this substance constitutes organism must matter, and
      according to the organism childhood ? adult ? elderly, this
      substance is gradually increased.<br>
      We then constitute organisms substances into three categories: 1,
      organics; 2, water; 3, inorganics, in line with the above
      conditions only inorganic.<br>
      Anatomy of an organism we can prove that all organisms inorganic
      content is based on biological, childhood ? adult ? elderly
      gradually increased, and this phenomenon in nature is impossible
      to reverse.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      Here we focus on to explain why the increase in the accumulation
      of inorganic substances, can cause biological aging and even
      death.<br>
      Both soluble and insoluble inorganic fraction non soluble salts in
      the body is difficult to gradually increase, can gradually
      accumulate in the body increase is mainly insoluble inorganic
      salts.<br>
      And yet one inorganic salt from a soluble to an insoluble.<br>
      We can no longer participate in life activities, and it is on the
      rise in vivo, inevitably resulting in a decline of vitality.<br>
      Suppose the same total body weight, increased body salts, the most
      straightforward is caused by the body of water and organic content
      share declined, and the vitality of life depends on the organic
      matter, organic matter decline in the proportion, vitality will
      decline.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      Here I vessels in the human body as an example Details: Patrons
      are inseparable from human cells and blood vessels, if the intake
      of food from outside the gradual deposition of inorganic salts in
      the body vessel wall, will inevitably result in smaller diameter
      vessels, resulting in the ability to pump blood vessels decreases,
      the supply of such cells that can be obtained will decrease,
      caused by aging cells due to lack of support.<br>
      And then to human bones as an example, the following figure taken
      from biology textbooks<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      We know that the bone marrow is where blood.<br>
      Bone marrow is the organic matter from the table, we can see very
      intuitive, as people age, bone mineral content increased, the
      proportion of organic matter decline, the body's hematopoietic
      function decline, hematopoietic capacity decreased, and causing
      cell received support decline, so that cell senescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0009]<br>
      Based on the above reasoning, I believe that biological life
      depends on its in vivo accumulation of inorganic increased speed,
      long slow accumulation of biological life, rapid accumulation of
      short biological life.<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      As the above theory is correct, we inorganic body by blocking an
      increase in vivo or in people insoluble salts into soluble salts
      from the body, reducing the proportion of body salts, humans will
      be possible to achieve longevity not old, even rejuvenated.<br>
      Here is the experiment conducted to prove that I assumed that I
      was 20 years old body mineral content as a percentage ratio of the
      weight value, and now I am 35 years old, if the proportion of
      inorganic let my body fall to 20-year-old value, then I will be
      able to reproduce the 20-year-old face.<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      In order to make my body proportion of inorganic fall, it began in
      2006 a large number of oral consumption of vinegar, hydrochloric
      acid, experiments carried out for almost a year, due to the mouth,
      stomach, liver, kidney and are subject to different degrees of
      damage, teeth can hardly bite hard, experiment was interrupted,
      after years of conditioning.<br>
      I also began at the end of this year, another experiment in vivo
      method of inorganic salts dissolved.<br>
      The in vitro method into the liquid, that is, after the body a lot
      of sweat, edible vinegar sprayed on the skin surface, absorbed
      through the skin into the body, several times a day.<br>
      Carried out for nearly four months, the experimental results began
      to appear, performance 1, the original bald hair out, hair began
      to grow new small, 2-3 cm long now; 2, skin wrinkles begin to
      disappear, the skin begins to become more tender.<br>
      3, has white hair began to darken; 4, the bones become more
      elastic, the whole body feels lighter, more power becomes
      abundant.<br>

      Through ecological re-cycling, plants take up the nutrients from
      the cadavers. But it is not understood whether the plant roots can
      take the nutrients and the genes of the dead plants and cadavers,
      to develop into a transgenic plants. Biotechnology has
      successfully developed transgenic plants and animals. Recently,
      gene sequencing studies, have shown that animals carry foreign
      genes making them as natural transgenic animals. Reason for the
      presence of transgenes not investigated. Further studies will
      enable us to learn more about the existence of transgenic flora
      and fauna and the role of gene re-cyling. Corroborating the
      Nature's hidden biological phenomena, like ethnicity, cyclic
      occurrence of diseases, re-appearance of extinct animals, Biblical
      citations etc., with modern literature on transgenic
      plants/animals, human genomic studies. gene sequencing, etc. it is
      hypothesized that genes of flora and fauna are recycled from
      generation to generation through immortal DNA. It will change the
      present concept of organism's mortality to immortality.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] Current literature on the cutting edge Biotechnology
      experimental findings, genetic engineering, gene sequencing and
      gene resequencing studies have enabled to hypothesize, the theory
      of “Gene re-cycling”, that genes of every flora and fauna are
      recycled from generation to generation through the transgenic
      plants, humans, animals, birds or fishes.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Gene re-cycling theory will reveal the scientific truth
      behind the natural biological phenomena occurring in our planet.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] As per the natural phenomenon occurring and the modern
      literature cited below, plant's roots can attract the genes from
      the humus of other organisms in the soil/water which will then
      become an integral part of the plant chromosome.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Such foreign genes from other species of organisms, after
      integrating it into the plant chromosome, will remain inactive and
      enter into a latent period. Genes, after entering into a
      homologous host and under appropriate environmental conditions
      will become active again and multiply with the gene expression of
      the original homologous host.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] This is a new theory invented/hypothesized. It has great
      utility for the following purposes:<br>
      1. Knowledge of disease outbreak/infection caused by the genes of
      pathogenic organisms transported from soil and water via
      transgenic plants/fishes to humans and animals, can help to take
      appropriate disease control measures,<br>
      2. Revealing the root cause of biosphere ethnicity due to genes in
      the food from Transgenic plants and animals,<br>
      3. Understanding the effect of expression of genes in the food on
      physiological and genetic changes in humans, animals and plants.<br>

      <b>Revised Experimental Proof</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Introduction:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] In the earlier Provisional Application dated Sep. 30, 2008,
      an experiment was planned to conduct the Gene sequencing and
      re-sequencing of human genome to prove the Gene Recycling and
      development of ethnicity. On my preliminary enquiry with gene
      sequencing scientists, it was found out that human genome has more
      than 1 million base pairs and the cost of sequencing and
      re-sequencing of human genome will be very high, since sequencing
      each base pair will be around ¢5 per base pair.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Hence it was decided to plan the experiment of gene
      re-cycling, with beef cattle (meat) having less number of genome
      base pair (roughly 22,000 genes). Sequencing of cow's Genome has
      been studied and is available in the Genome bank.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Current literature: In the AARP bulletin today
      (http://bulletin_aarp.org/your/health/policy/articles/scientists
      _unravel_genome_of_the_cow.ht.8/82009 it was reported that “Of
      cow's 22,000 genes versions of at least 14,000 have counterparts
      in other mammals. Cows appear to have 1000 genes that they share
      with dogs and rodents (Brown, and Lewin 2009)”. It shows that 1000
      latent genes of heterologus species (dogs and rodents) that are
      not found in people, might have entered the cow's genome through
      gene recycling, developing the animal into a transgenic cow. This
      transgenic cow, hidden in her roughly 22000 genes are hints of how
      natural selection/gene re-cycling, sculpted a bovine, with full
      gene expression over the past 60 million years (Brown, D and
      Lewin, H. A. 2009). It shows that 1000 latent genes of heterologus
      species (dogs and rodents) that are not found in people, might
      have entered the cow's genome through gene re-cycling, developing
      the animal into a transgenic cow. This transgenic cow, hidden in
      her roughly 22000 genes are hints of how natural selection/gene
      re-cycling, sculpted a bovine, with full gene expression over the
      past 60 million years (Brown and Lewin, 2009)”. This scientific
      report indicate that natural biological Gene re-cycling results in
      the development of transgenic organism, creating new species of a
      unicellular/multicellular organism (extinct animals and birds)
      through Gene re-cycling take place with long periods of time,
      depending upon the biology of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The above scientific literature fully proves/support the
      theory of Gene Re-cycling, as transgenic animals are being
      developed naturally in the development of new life on Earth. When
      the genes, recycle through inter species and intra species, it
      makes the genes immortal with or without mutation. As time goes
      many such articles may be published proving gene re-cycling is not
      a Hypothesis, but a proven naturally existing scientific truth.
      This made me to submit a Non-provisional Patent Application.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Meanwhile I have also planned an experiment, which may not
      be necessary as per the scientific proof given in the paragraph
      [0008 and 0009] given above to produce transgenic cereal plant by
      planting the cereal seeds in soil buried with beef meat
      (putrefied). After conducting the squencing and re-sequencing
      studies of the beef cattle genes and that of cereals, the
      transgenic genotype of the cereal will be decided.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] After confirming the transgenic nature of the cereal it
      will be fed to the mice/rabbits and observe those experimental
      animal for the transgenes from the beef cattle. The result will be
      published in scientific journal/scientific conference.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In the light of the above a Non-Provisional Application on
      “Gene re-cycling” as given below, has been submitted as a
      continuation of Utility Provisional application No. 61/194,637 Dt.
      Sep. 30, 2008 for Patent registration.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Plants take up the nutrients from the dead and putrefied
      flora (humus) &amp; fauna, recycle it for the nutrition and growth
      of humans, plants and animals, and thus maintain ecological
      re-cycling system. Similarly the herbivores and carnivores animals
      also play their own role in the ecological recycling process.
      However more scientific data is required to know, whether the
      plants can take not only the nutrients but also the
      genes/viruses/bacteria from the infected materials, dead animals,
      humans, birds or plants in the soil &amp; water and recycle those
      genes, generation after generation making the biosphere as
      immortal. Hence it is hypothesized that genes of every flora and
      fauna are recycled from generation to generation through the
      plants, humans, animals, birds and fishes (living in land, sky and
      water).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] When the “Gene Recycling” hypothesis is proved the concept
      of mortality of living beings will be changed to immortality. This
      is a postmodern century of interrogation. “Gene Recycling”
      hypothesis can provide full or partial answer for many of the
      Mother nature's biological phenomenon we now see in the world.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Based on the modern scientific literature and technology,
      the theory of “Gene Recycling”, can provide a strong support to
      the natural unknown biological phenomena occurring in our planet.
      It is in the hidden plan of the Creator for making the
      biosphere/life on this planet as immortal. As per the natural
      phenomenon occurring and the modern literature cited below,
      plant's roots can attract the genes from the humus of other
      organisms in the soil/water which will then become an integral
      part of the plant chromosome. Such foreign genes from other
      species of organisms, after integrating it into the plant
      chromosome will remain inactive and enter into a latent period.
      Genes, after entering into a homologous host or under appropriate
      environmental conditions will become active again and multiply
      with the gene expression of the original host. The scientific
      literature given below provide s a strong support to the “Gene
      Recycling” hypothesis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Natural Biological Phenomena:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0000]<br>
      <b>1. Prevalence of Ethnic Population and Evolutionary
        Conservatism.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] All organisms on Earth appear to be unrelated in the
      evolutionary process of different species of plants, birds,
      animals, mammals and humans. But a detailed study of the molecular
      biology of cells, has shown that basic molecular structure of all
      living organisms are conserved to a great extent and all have the
      same chemical structure such as amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
      and nucleotides. Besides the above, other resembling factors are
      that the genetic information of all multi cellular organisms,
      stored in the genome, is carried by DNA and is transported, from
      generation to generations. The hereditary information is stored in
      all the cells in the DNA as chemical code, arranged in linear
      fashion (Koonin, 2002).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] We can also notice the family resemblances among genes
      coding for proteins. Genes and portions of genes get duplicated to
      develop into new diverse genes through mutation of the parent
      genes. Usually one cell expresses only a fraction of its genes.
      Changes in the environment due to signals from other cells can
      influence the pattern of genes they express. The gene expression
      by different sets of genes produces different types of cells in a
      multicellular organism. Thus a small group of genes may multiply
      to develop into higher plant or animal species with large number
      of genes. A broad phylogenic picture provides a rough idea of the
      relation ship between the species on our planet Earth (Li, W-H and
      Graur, 1991).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (a) “Gene Recycling” Hypothesis Claim:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] If the roots of the plants are taking organic and Inorganic
      nutrients along with the genes from the human and animal cadavers,
      then the plant and its parts or fruits will also contain these
      human, animal genes, which will remain as tent genes. The
      plant/its parts or fruits containing such foreign (human/animal)
      latent genes, when consumed by other people in the locality or
      town, the genes may enter their gastro intestinal system and
      reproductive system (gonads). It may then remain in the system as
      latent genes. These latent foreign genes which have entered into
      the gonads may pass it on to their progeny and become active and
      provide gene expression (dominant genes) in the next generation of
      people in the locality/town. This will result in ethnicity (common
      characters related to place of origin, culture, speech, food
      habits etc.) in those local people.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) Supporting literature:</b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. (b) 1. Transgenic plants:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] Genetic engineering studies have revealed that a mutant
      gene can be inserted into the chromosome of a plant cell and it
      becomes a part of the plant genome. In the laboratory experiment
      it has been shown that, when the tobacco leaf discs incubated in a
      selection media with genetically engineered Agrobacteria, the
      injured cells at the edge of the plant leaf disc, released
      substances that attract the Agrobacteria which carry a recombinant
      plasmid with a selectable marker and desired transgene, inject its
      bacterial DNA into the plant cells. The plant cells which take up
      the appropriate bacterial DNA, survive and proliferate to express
      the selectable marker gene, and develop into a callus. When these
      calluses are placed in special medium, it will induce the
      production of shoots. These then develop into adult plants
      carrying transgenes (Davey et al., 1989 &amp; Walden and Schell,
      1990).<br>
      1. (b) 1.1. Transgenic Plant Experiment Supports the Hypothesis:<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Similar to the experiment stated above if an injured cell
      from the plant leaf is attracting the DNA from the bacteria; as
      per the hypothesis, under natural environmental conditions, the
      injured cells of plant roots can also attract/absorb/take up the
      gene(s) along with the nutrients from the dead and putrefying
      flora (humus) and fauna in the soil/water. When such a foreign
      gene from other species is recognized by a plant cell, it will
      efficiently transfer a DNA strand of human/animal/bacterial/viral
      gene to the plant cell. It then becomes the part of plant
      chromosome, survive to grow into a transgenic plant carrying such
      a foreign gene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1 (b) 1. 2. Possibility 1:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] The transgenic plants (or its product) carrying foreign
      gene when consumed by species homologous to the gene, it can
      develop to express the phenotypic and genotypic characters of the
      gene. In other cases it may remain as latent gene and express it
      only when it enters into a host homologous to the gene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 1. 3. Possibility 2:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] The transgenic plants (or its product) carrying foreign
      gene when consumed by species heterologous to the gene, it may
      remain as a latent gene and will pass it on to its progeny and
      continue to remain as latent gene in the progeny.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 2. Transgenic animals:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] In the case of mouse, foreign DNA can be randomly
      integrated into the genome. When fragments of DNA are introduced
      into cells, they are rapidly joined end to end by intra cellular
      enzymes and form long tandem arrays. These are then randomly
      integrated into a chromosome. When original gene(s) of an animal,
      is thus altered permanently, such an animal is known as transgenic
      animal. The genes which are responsible for altering are called
      transgenes (Boyd and Samid, 1993 &amp; Palmiter and Brinster,
      1986).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 3. Role of Gene Regulatory Proteins:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] Genome (whole set of genetic information belonging to a
      cell/organism carried by DNA) in its DNA sequenquence carries the
      information to express many thousands of different proteins and
      RNA molecules. Usually cells express only a fraction of its genes.
      The gene expression by different sets of genes produces different
      types of cells in a multicellular organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Changes in the environment such as signals from other cells
      can influence the pattern of genes they express. Even though the
      expression of a gene is generally regulated, the initiation of RNA
      transcription will be an important control point for most genes.
      The transcription of the gene in the DNA is controlled by the
      regulatory region at which it starts. These regulatory regions
      function like tiny microprocessors. Thus these regions act like
      switches by responding to the various signals, which they
      interpret and integrate the neighboring gene to switch on or off.
      Bacterial Genetic study conducted in 1950 gave the first evidence
      on the existence of “gene regulatory proteins”. These gene
      regulatory proteins, turns specific sets of genes on or off, the
      production of proteins. These are called “repressors” as they shut
      off the production of proteins. These repressors can be (1) viral
      encoded gene regulatory protein or (2) bacterial gene regulatory
      protein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 3. 1. Viral Encoded Gene Regulatory Protein</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] The bacteriophage lambda repressor, is a gene regulatory
      protein encoded by a bacterial virus. It shuts off the viral genes
      that code for the protein components of new virus particles. Thus
      it enables the viral genome to remain as silent occupier in the
      viral chromosome and multiplies along with the bacterial growth.
      Lambda repressor is one of such regulatory proteins which are
      encoded by bacteriophage lambda. This lambda repressor shuts off
      the viral genes that code for the protein components of new virus
      particles, and there by makes the virus genome inactive in the
      bacterial chromosome. But the mutant bacteriophage lambda cannot
      shut off the specific set of genes. With the help of DNA
      sequencing and DNA foot print studies it has been found that these
      regulatory proteins are bound to specific DNA sequences close to
      the genes which they regulate (Gilbert and Muller-Hill, 1967;
      Jacob and Monod, 1961; Kaiser, 1957 &amp; Ptashne, 1967).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1 (b) 3. 2. Bacterial Gene Regulatory Protein:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] The lac repressor is the first bacterial gene regulatory
      protein to be recognized. These generally respond when there is a
      nutritional requirement and they respond by shutting off genes
      encoding specific sets of metabolic enzymes when they are not
      necessary. Thus when sugar is absent in the medium, lac repressor
      turns off the production of the proteins responsible for lactose
      metabolism, (Jacob and Monod, 1961 &amp; Gilbert and Muller-Hill,
      1967).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 4. Growth Factors Regulate the Protein Synthesis:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] The growth factors regulate the protein synthesis and
      stimulate the cell/proliferation. Most growth factors also
      stimulate cell growth. (Loughlin and Fallon, 1992 and Purves,
      1988).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 5. Cells Enter Into Non Growing State—“G Zero” in the
        Absence of Growth Factors:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] Mammalian cells stopped growth between mitosis and S phase,
      when they are deprived of serum which contains highly specific
      proteins called Growth Factors. In the absence of serum these,
      cells will delay division by entering a specialized non growing
      state called “G zero” (Pardee, 1974 &amp; 1989).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (b) 6. Cell Senescence:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] Cells from mammalian tissue cultures can be propagated only
      for a certain number of cell divisions (50 divisions for human
      cell cultures), after wards they cease to divide and die. This
      process is called cell senescence. But some cells derived from
      rodent tissue cultures escape senescence and divide indefinitely
      to produce cell lines (Todaro and Green, 1963).<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. (c) Hypothesis Linked to the Above Cited Literature:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] Similar to the reference cited above the mammalian gene(s)
      taken up by the roots of the plants can remain as silent occupier,
      in the plant/heterogenous species, as the gene regulatory proteins
      switch off the foreign genes, or the cells may cease to divide due
      to cell senescence. It will only multiply and provide the original
      specific gene expression, . with phenotypic and genotypic
      characters, if it enters a homologous host and under suitable
      internal or external environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] When the root of the plant takes up the (dominant) genes of
      other species from the soil, these foreign (to the plant) genes
      will lie in a latent state as lambda bacteriophage is integrated
      into E. Coli. These genes foreign to the plant may then enter into
      other species (humans/animals) through the consumption of the
      plant products, containing genes of other species and will be
      passed on to a different species (humans/animals/birds). The gene
      regulatory proteins can switch on or off specific sets of genes,
      depending upon the homologous host cell in which the gene is
      integrated. Parmley et al. ( 2007) recently reported that a
      secondary function of some pieces of DNA has the capacity to hold
      back the function of production of the protein, by keeping a check
      and slowing the process of associated genes, becoming ideal
      protein machines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0051] Experiments proposed: Experiment 1. 1. Study to find out
        whether the plant roots take up the human genes from the soil
        and get integrated into plant chromosomes.</b><b><br>

      participate in this study, using the commercially available ISO

      agencies for human DNA testing. The 13 markers are referred to as
      the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). All of these 13 markers are
      used only in the determination of human identity” (GTL, 2008).

      [0000] II. Natural phenomena:<br>
      Cyclic development of viral diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Present scientific view is that the pathogenic
      bacteria/viruses exist in animals or birds as they become carriers
      of bacteria/viruses (host—parasite balance) without producing
      disease. Under adverse environmental conditions the disease
      outbreak occurs, due to the break down of immunity in those
      carrier animals/birds causing the cyclic development of disease
      outbreaks. Friedman (1992) reported that viral chromosomes can
      integrate into host chromosomes. The viruses which are integrated
      into the plant chromosome need not multiply immediately, but goes
      into a latent state and remain as inactive in the plant cells as
      provirus. It will come active only under suitable conditions
      sometimes after passing through several hosts/generations.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Hypothesis: The viruses/bacteria in the dead bodies of the
      humans/animals or the human/animal excreta, will be taken up by
      the roots of the plants grown in the soil in that area, get
      integrated into the plant chromosomes. The cyclic outbreak of
      certain viral diseases can then be attributed to the release of
      the viruses integrated into the plant chromosome, when such plants
      or its part/fruit are consumed by susceptible (immune compromised)
      humans or animals, resulting in an infection in the people/animals
      leading to fresh outbreak of the viral/bacterial infection in that
      area. The delay in the outbreak may be due to the time the
      virus/bacteria takes to travel from the roots to fruit/plant parts
      and the chance occurrence of a susceptible person/animal, eating
      the affected plant part. It is also important to note that certain
      plants like coconut trees/jack fruit trees etc. will take 5-8
      years to bear fruits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. Supporting Literature:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <b>1. Viral Chromosomes Integrate Into Host Chromosomes:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0067] The viral chromosomes after entering a host cell,
      necessarily need not multiply to produce more viral progeny.
      Because the genomes of these viruses enter into a latent state and
      become inactive in the host cell without producing any progeny.
      This viral latency was found out when uninfected bacteria, on
      exposure to UV light was able to induce the production of progeny
      of bacteriophages. Subsequently it was shown that these uninfected
      bacteria (lysogenic bacteria) carry in their chromosome, a
      complete viral (bacteriophage) chromosome lying in a dormant
      state. These types of host integrated viral chromosomes are called
      “provirus”. Bacteriophages which can integrate their DNA into
      bacterial chromosomes are called as temperate bacteriophages.
      Bacteriophage lambda is a temperate bacteriophage and when it
      infects a suitable E. coli host cell, it can grow either by lytic
      or lysogenic pathway. In the lytic path way lambda multiplies to
      several progeny particles and they will be released when the E.
      coli is lysed. In the lysogenic pathway, the integrated viral DNA
      replicates along with the host chromosome and produce new
      integrated viral DNA copies, resulting in the development of a
      lysogenic bacterium. This lysogenic cell multiplies in the normal
      way. But when it is exposed to any environmental insult/changes
      like exposure to UV light, or ionizing radiation, the cell becomes
      fragile/weakened leading to the release of the integrated provirus
      from the cell chromosome. Then it will lead a normal cycle of
      viral multiplication. It shows that the integrated provirus will
      not perish along with its damaged host cell, but can escape to
      infect other E. coli Campbell (1993).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Hypothesis: As per the literature cited above the
      mammalian/human gene(s) taken by the roots of the plants can
      integrate itself into plant chromosome and will remain as an
      integrated gene. The integrated foreign gene will be released from
      the plant chromosome, when the plant products are consumed by
      humans/animals etc. or cause any physical or chemical injury to
      the plant cell due to any environmental changes like extreme heat
      or cold or change in the nutritional status of the plant. Then the
      gene released from the plant chromosome will then follow the lytic
      or lysogenic path way and will lead to the escape of the released
      gene to other species. When the gene enters a heterologous
      unrelated species of organism, the gene regulatory proteins will
      switch off the foreign genes entered into unrelated host. If the
      gene released from the plant cell entered into a new suitable
      homologous species, related to the gene's original host, the gene
      regulatory proteins will be switched on.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] To explain it further, the human gene integrated into the
      plant cell chromosome, when released by the consumption of humans,
      the gene(s) will enter a new cell in the human body, it will be
      expressed providing the phenotypic and genotypic characters of the
      gene remained in the plant chromosome as integrated gene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] III. Natural phenomena: Transmission of Prions (PrP
        Gene) Through Food and Hereditary:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0070] Feeding “Renderers meat” with sheep offal, contaminated
      with Scrapie (PrPsc) produce BSE infection/mad cow disease in beef
      cattle. Consumption of beef infected with BSE/TSE prion (aberrant
      protein) will produce vCJD infection in humans. The causative
      agent of BSE/TSE is believed to be a small protein infectious
      particle (prion) which resist inactivation by the methods capable
      of destroying nucleic acids. The recent discovery that only a
      protein can cause and transmit the disease is shocking to the
      molecular biologists and virologists.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Hypothesis: As prions are transmitted through food and
      hereditary, the genes integrated into the plant chromosome when
      consumed by the animal or humans, will also produce gene
      expression in the animals/humans, if the gene is homologous or
      continue to remain as latent gene as in the case of prions
      (production of a slow latent infection).<br>
      <br>
      <b>III. 1. Supporting Literature:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0072] Feeding “Renderers meat” with sheep offal, contaminated
      with ovine prion protein (PrP) gene in scrapie (Shiquan, et al.
      (2002) produce BSE infection/mad cow disease in beef cattle.
      Consumption of beef infected with BSE/TSE prion (aberrant protein)
      will produce vCJD infection in humans. Humans can be infected by
      Prions either as acquired through diet and surgical procedures or
      through “apparent hereditary Mendelian transmission where it is an
      autosomal and dominant trait” (Alan Cann, 2005). Prions are
      responsible for a slow developing disease due to the latent
      infection. It can be compared to the latent gene/host integrated
      viral chromosomes or provirus/bacteriophage lambda (Campbell,
      1993).<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV. Natural Phenomena/Mythology:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0073] Re-incarnation myth becomes a scientific reality due to
      modern scientific biotechnology success in cloning, and
      Transgenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In India there are so many stories of
      re-incarnation/re-birth of a person in another part of India or
      world. Re-cycling of genes is probable explanation for the myth of
      re-incarnation. It is possible to explain hypothetically that the
      dominant genes of “X” person's cadaver integrated into the soil,
      when taken up by the root of the plant, will remain as latent
      genes in the plant part/fruit. If the plant part is then taken up
      by another person and entered into the gonad of another person,
      the phenotypic and genotypic character of the dominant gene of the
      “X” person will be expressed in the progeny as
      rebirth/reincarnation of the “X” person.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Re-incarnation story give strong support to the Gene
      Recycling Hypothesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Gene re-cycling hypothesis can be the scientific/nature's
      explanation for the Hindu mythological stories on people with
      animal face/head and human body or female body with fish tail
      (Mermaid) manifested as nature's freak, due to incomplete
      expression of human gene(s), integrated into animal chromosome
      (transgenic animal) or vice versa. Traditionally many people
      attribute such nature's freak is endowed with God's power Cherubim
      is a typical example for transgenic person with incomplete
      expression of genes from other species like animals &amp; birds.
      It is also possible that the human gene is carried by another
      animal as shown in the movie of the dog “Fluke”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>V. Natural Phenomena:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Reappearance of the Extinct Animals and Birds:<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Cell theory of 19thcentury stated that all living organisms
      possess cells and the new cells are developed only from the
      existing cells. Thus all Eukaryotic or Prokaryotic unicellular or
      multi cellular organisms are developed through the evolution from
      an original population of primitive “cells”.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Hypothesis: New cells will be developed by recycling the
      genes of the previous generation of living organisms existed
      earlier on earth. The well-known saying “Life comes after death”
      should be a scientific fact. The animals and birds once lived on
      earth after extinction may come back again to life through the
      recycling of the genes deposited in the humus and remained as
      integral part of the soil. The plants grown on such soil with the
      genes of the extinct animals and birds, may take up the genes
      through its roots and can remain in the leaves and fruits. When
      animals/birds of other species eat the leaves/fruits, the genes of
      extinct animals/birds, may enter the body of the new host and by
      entering the ova/sperm may re produce the life of the extinct
      species. Recently it has been reported that Black footed Ferret
      which was extinct has been found recently.<br>

      <br>
      VI. A. Genes in the Tree—Tree of Life: Garden of Eden:Bible

      [0080] “8. And the Lord God planted a garden toward the east, in
      Eden; and there He placed the man whom he had formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] “9. And out of the ground the Lord God caused to grow every
      tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of
      life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the
      knowledge of good and evil”.<br>
      <br>
      VI. B. Forbidden Fruit: Does the Fruit From the Tree in the Garden
      of Eden Contained Gene to Know Good and Evil?<br>

      “2 And the woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees
      of the garden, we may eat;<br>
      <br>
      [0083] “3. but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle
      of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it or touch
      it lest you die!<br>
      <br>
      [0084] “4. And the serpent said to the woman, You surely shall not
      die!<br>
      <br>
      [0085] “5. For God knows that in the day you eat from it your
      eyes, will be opened and “you will be like God, knowing good and
      evil”.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] VI. C. Gene expression—Tree of Life: Disobedience and Fall
      of Man and Woman from God's Grace: Bible, 1973: Genesis Ch. 3,
      verse 22-24.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] “22 Then the lord God said, “Behold, the man has become
      like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he stretch
      out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat and
      live forever”—<br>
      <br>
      [0087] “23 therefore the Lord God sent him out from the Garden of
      Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] “24 So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden
      of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which
      turned every direction, to guard the way to the tree of life”.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Hypothesis: The above Biblical passage gives us the insight
      that God intended that man and woman to lead an eternal life by
      eating the fruit of “the Tree of Life”. But since man and woman
      disobeyed God and sinned, He threw them out of the Garden so that
      they will not have eternal life, simply by eating the fruit.
      Instead they (we) have to toil in the soil and go back into the
      soil, so that our gene will integrate with the soil and will
      regenerate again into humans with the gene integrated in the
      trees/plants/fruits rooted in the same soil. Thus each tree by
      taking the human genes from the soil with their roots, become the
      symbolic of the tree of life of the Garden of Eden.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Thus through the recycling of genes through the plants/tree
      of life, humans have eternal life and will have several
      opportunity to become self purified to receive the<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Lord Jesus when He comes 2&lt;nd &gt;time. It can be
      presumed that each civilization on this earth is a re-incarnation
      of the previous civilization. If each person on this earth is a
      new entry into this planet, God must have created several billions
      or trillions of people, but through recycling of genes most
      probably, we are all born repeatedly on this earth
      (re-incarnation/rebirth?).<br>
      <br>
      VI. D. God Can Raise Up Children From Stones:<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Bible (1973). New Testament; Matthew Ch. 3, verse. 9 “and
      do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, We have Abraham for
      our father; “for I say to you, that God is able from these stones
      to raise up children to Abraham”. We cannot simply ignore this as
      a statement by John the Baptist out of his anger or frustration.
      If we read it in between the lines, then we can understand or
      presume, that the soil and the stones may contain the genes of the
      human beings, hence John the Baptist knowingly or unknowingly said
      that God can raise the people from the stones/soil.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Hypothesis: If we understand that every flora and fauna
      seen on the earth are mortal and become part of the earth after
      their life span, then we should also know that new life on earth
      starts not only by recycling the nutrients but also by genes of
      the dead flora and fauna.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The well known fact: “LIFE COMES AFTER DEATH”, will be
      supportive of the hypothesis that genes of every flora and fauna
      are recycled from generation to generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] VI. E. Ezekiel's Prophesy of Life from Dry Bones:<br>
      Bible (1973). Ezekiel—Book of Ezekiel: Ch. 37. verse 1-14,<br>
      <br>
      [0096] “The hand of the lord was upon me, and He brought me out by
      the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the
      valley; and it was full of bones.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] “2 And He caused me to pass among them round about, and
      behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo,
      they were very dry.<br>
      <br>

      And I answered, “0 Lord God, Thou knowest.”<br>
      <br>
      [0099] “4 Again He said to me “Prophecy over these bones and say
      to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.”<br>
      <br>
      [0100] “5 Thus says the Lord God to these bones, Behold I will
      cause breath (spirit) to enter you that you may come to life.<br>

      come to life.”<br>

      into them, and they came to life, and stood on their feet, an
      exceedingly great army.<br>

      God, “Behold I will open your graves and cause you to come up out
      of your graves, My people; and I will bring you unto the land of
      Israel.<br>

      [0108] “13 “ Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have
      opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves,
      My people”.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] “14 “And I will put My Spirit within you and you will come
      to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know
      that I the Lord have spoken and done it, “declares the Lord.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0110] By applying modern science and technology knowledge, it is
      hypothesized that “Genes of every flora and fauna are recycled
      from generation to generation through the plants, humans, birds
      and animals living in land and water”. Gene Recycling plays the
      most crucial role in the continued propagation of flora and fauna
      on our planet. Through gene recycling, biosphere is made to
      immortal existence. This is a postmodern century of interrogation.
      Gene Recycling Hypothesis can provide full or partial answer for
      many of the nature's phenomenon we now see in the world.<br>

      Inventor: CHOUDURY SPANDAN<br>
      Also published as: WO2009147634 // GB2475181 <br>
      <br>
      This Patent Application presents a biomedical mechanism of
      feasibly effecting tangible human immortality. The applicant
      believes that this technique is the only feasible and meaningful
      means of effecting perpetual persistence of human life. It forgoes
      all modern day approaches in the world up to now that target
      medical mechanisms to extend the life span of the body, and
      instead adopts a fundamentally novel innovation by way of enabling
      the biomedical transfer of the cognition that essentially
      constitutes a human to a different body prior to the death of the
      original body, whereby the transfer is NOT a copy of (and hence
      what would otherwise NOT be) the essential original human but IS
      the essential original human itself.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The field of invention is biomedical engineering. It
      primarily, but not only, involves neuroscience and electrical
      engineering. A novel, and possibly the ONLY feasible, means of
      effective persistence of human life for perpetuity is presented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] As indicated above, the applicant deems it futile of anyone
      to attempt to keep the human body alive perpetually—THAT WILL
      NEVER WORK. EVER, although it will be possible to increase the
      relative duration of the longevity of the body. It is a reasonable
      expectation that regardless of the state of research even millions
      of years from now, each body WILL die some time, either from old
      age, or external events (including diseases caused by external
      events, accidents etc). That, is because given the virtually
      unlimited count of interacting variables involved inside and
      outside a body to keep it alive, it will forever be impossible to
      successfully manage them all for eternity.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] This Patent Application presents the applicant's novel
      invention on a practical mechanism of essential persistence of
      life for perpetuity.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The applicant sees two perspectives to human immortality—<br>
      <br>
      A. Immortality only from the perspective of people that knew the
      original human, but not from the perspective of the original
      human.<br>
      B. Genuine immortality from the perspective of the original human.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The applicant infers that while it will in principle be
      technically feasible soon to transfer the cognitive and
      sufficiently important individual-defining non-cognitive contents
      of the human brain to a new brain (or another equivalent entity)
      whereby the people who knew the dead human would perceive the new
      entity containing the transferred data as essentially having
      simulated the original human, the key flaw in that approach is
      that the original human being will NOT feel as having continued
      life in the new entity—the original human's sense of self identity
      “I” would not be transferred into the new entity. Instead the
      second human's sense of self identity would be of a new “I” that
      would be a reasonable COPY of the original human's identity, and
      there could in principle be an unlimited count of such copies
      across multiple entities. That, however, does not constitute
      genuine immortality. In short, if the original human was “Mary” or
      “James” the second entity would still say “I am Mary” or “I am
      James”, but the original Mary or James would not accept the
      respective second entities as them, both when the original Mary or
      James are still alive and after their body-death. For purposes of
      this Patent Application, the original human will be referred to as
      “Mary-I”, while the second human per “A” would be “Mary-II-A”, and
      that per “B” “Mary-II-B”. This Patent Application pertains to the
      creation of Mary-II-B.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] This Patent Application is on the second perspective (“B.”)
      listed in the previous section, whereby the original human Mary-I
      would actually recognize herself as having been transferred into
      the new entity, with that entity being preferably a regular human
      brain attached to a regular human body.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] There will be a common period of time prior to Mary-I's
      body-death when Mary-I and Mary-II-B would both be simultaneously
      alive, and while still alive Mary-I will be able to confirm her
      being able to recognize the (foreign) memory and cognition of the
      second brain and sense input from the second body. Mary-I will in
      effect be able to use not only her own brain's resources (i.e. her
      brain hardware and data) and input from the senses of her own
      body, but also be able to use the resources (i.e. brain hardware
      and data) of the second brain and receive input from the senses of
      the second body. Then, per the mechanism described in this Patent
      Application, Mary-I will willfully “transfer” her memory and
      consciousness to the second body. Of course, the people around the
      original human (Mary-I) would deem the second human (Mary-II-B) as
      essentially being even more of Mary-I, than would be the case with
      Mary-II-A.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF DIAGRAMS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] FIG. 1—Demonstrates a sample neural network of 8 brains,
      including Mary-I's original, that forms an integrated, single,
      logical, augmented center of consciousness. As indicated, upon
      subsequent physical delinking, ordinarily at most only one of the
      7 other brains can manifest Mary-II-B, while each of the remaining
      6 can at most manifest Mary-II-A. Arrows indicate direction of
      flow of information, hence the direction of consciousness
      transport prospect, albeit the invention recommends
      dual-directional rather than unidirectional arrows in each case.
      Of course, the at-most-single Mary-II-B brain is only in as much
      as that only a single, logical, (augmented or diminished)
      integrated center of consciousness can be created to control one
      brain or a set of linked brains—and so it is optionally possible
      to have Mary-II-B to be created across multiple brains that are
      combined to form a single, integrated, logical center of
      consciousness. There will still ever be only ONE Mary-II-B,
      regardless of whether or not she is created in one brain or across
      multiple brains. The latter would not be recommended because of
      the logistical inconvenience that would be associated with the
      need to have multiple brains constantly communicate towards
      maintaining that logical, integrated center of consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] FIG. 2—Demonstrates a sample neural network of 8 brains,
      including Mary-I's original, that forms an integrated, single,
      logical, augmented center of consciousness, whereby, upon
      subsequent physical delinking, while only one (ordinarily the
      maximum count permissible per this invention's inference) of the 7
      other brains manifest Mary-II-B, only 3 of those 7 other brains
      manifest Mary-II-A and the remaining choose to retain their
      respective original identities. Arrows indicate direction of flow
      of information, hence the direction of consciousness transport
      prospect, albeit the invention recommends dual-directional rather
      than unidirectional arrows in each case. Again, the at-most-single
      Mary-II-B brain is only in as much as that only a single, logical,
      (augmented or diminished) integrated center of consciousness can
      be created to control one brain or a set of linked brains—and so
      it optionally is possible to have Mary-II-B to be created across
      multiple brains that are combined to form a single, integrated,
      logical center of consciousness. There will still ever be only ONE
      Mary-II-B, regardless of whether or not she is created in one
      brain or across multiple brains. The latter would not be
      recommended because of the logistical inconvenience that would be
      associated with the need to have multiple brains constantly
      communicate towards maintaining that logical, integrated center of
      consciousness.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0017] What is self identity and how is that relevant to perpetual
      persistence of life?<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the context of this invention it would be relevant to
      understand precisely what constitutes one's being aware of oneself
      and hence one's existence. While the views presented in this
      section are entirely the applicant's own, they do NOT by
      themselves constitute the invention itself, but instead
      justify/prove/validate the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The first step towards that understanding would be to
      analyze if a human brain soon after conception were in principle
      medically isolated from all possible forms of input (to the brain)
      for decades afterwards while still being artificially provided all
      forms of nutrition to keep it medically alive and cause it to
      physiologically mature as brains would normally grow would at all
      have a consciousness and consequently have a sense of
      self-awareness. In other words, could a human brain develop
      consciousness when right from its inception it ceased to have
      absolutely any auditory, visual, olfactory, taste or tactile or
      absolutely any other form of input—the latter including a sense of
      pain, pressure, vibration etc. (which essentially are appropriate
      combined or singular renditions of the fundamental five senses
      anyway)? Regardless of whether that brain would still have
      medically “awake” and “sleep” cycles, including cycles of dreams,
      what could that brain base its consciousness on?<br>
      <br>
      [0020] To answer that, one could ask oneself how one recognizes
      oneself cognitively immediately upon waking up from sleep. That
      awareness is from independent, corroborating recent (and sometimes
      past) memories of incidences, in addition to corroborating new
      input from the five senses with memories already in the brain of
      similar prior input (e.g. the visual/auditory input on
      surroundings being either similar to or different from what is
      already in memory, etc). Hence there need be some memory for self
      awareness. Memory is accepted as valid memory (and not
      imagination) with a high degree of conviction when it can be
      corroborated with other memory—and therefore the reality of memory
      is that each experience typically gets laid down in long term
      memory as a set of independent memories that effectively
      corroborate (and therefore reinforce/validate) each other—e.g.,
      the memory of having simply sat in a chair somewhere could be
      recalled from various separate sitting-/time-/surroundings-/etc.
      angles, hence when recalling that experience one would essentially
      corroborate across multiple memories of that experience and
      therefore reasonably assess that one did indeed sit on that chair.
      In contrast to that, if all one recalled from that experience was
      just One Single Static memory of sitting on the chair, one would
      fail to adequately corroborate that memory with other memories of
      the same experience, and hence one would reasonably question the
      accuracy of that memory. The fact that most incidences are
      perceived across a span of time, however short, enables a memory
      of each such incident to be laid down as a set of corroborating
      memories, and of course the more intense an experience the greater
      would be the information content and count of such independent,
      corroborating memories. It could be noted that the count of
      memories of any experience would also increase with the intensity
      of that experience, even if the core incident behind that
      experience was fleeting. That is because the intensity of the
      experience would enable the individual to accept input (to be
      mentally tagged to that experience) on that experience for an
      appropriate period even after its occurrence. For example, if a
      person accidentally suffers a cut to a finger from a very
      momentary lapse of concentration while, say, cutting a piece of
      fruit to eat, the consequences of that cut would substantially add
      to the memory content of that experience, which would all be
      appropriately considered later for independent mental lookup and
      corroboration towards ascertaining whether one did indeed cut
      one's finger. As the brain continually lays new memories
      appropriate to the perceived significance of an experience, the
      longer an experience persists, and the more significant an
      experience is assessed to be at and shortly following the time it
      occurs, the more separate (yet linked, as they relate to the same
      event/experience) memories of it would be laid down that can later
      be collectively accessed for a corroborative validation on if the
      recalled past event/experience's having actually occurred. Each of
      those memories is built with various layers of the “knowledge
      framework of rules” (with basic rules at the lowest layers, and at
      the upper layers are more complex rules created using the
      relatively lower layers' basic rules and other rules of typical
      complexity not more that itself) that one gradually first develops
      at early childhood and continues developing on subsequently for
      one's entire lifetime (forming more and more complex rules). As
      particular complex rules are used more often, they themselves get
      directly interpreted to major extents without requiring referring
      the lower rules for interpretation, therefore increasing the speed
      of processing of related complex experiences. In short, self
      awareness requires memory, and for memory to form there have to be
      experiences, which are impossible in the absence of external
      input. It is important to recognize that if there is even a tiny
      amount of any input given to the brain at any time (e.g. in the
      case of any individual who might be born regular, but soon looses
      all physical senses within a day of birth), the brain would take
      that minimum information that was available for a day and
      naturally proceed to build up on that towards continually
      generating newer information databases—and in that case the brain
      WOULD be conscious. That build up of new information in that
      stated particular brain would largely be abstract of course as
      additional external input would be absent that would otherwise
      have enabled the buildup of a framework of a pool of rules
      adequately reflective of “reality”, but the brain would still
      develop an altered consciousness “in a world of its own”. It is
      significant to note that that state of abstraction is NOT truly
      unreal per se, but it is abstract in the context of the “real”
      world that regular humans live in. The human brain is designed to
      accept external input, however minimal, and, based on its
      significance, appropriately process the information contained in
      that input towards not only optimizing the subsequent application
      of the perceived rule(s) contained in that input, but also develop
      more complex rules premised on the basic rule(s) as voluntary and
      deemed necessary choices in anticipation of a need to apply such
      complex rules.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Therefore in the complete absence of all forms of external
      input, the applicant infers that it is logical that that brain
      would fail to have a meaningful form of consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] There would essentially be no meaningful functional
      difference between its states of wakefulness and sleep, even if
      the brain goes through biological sleep and wakefulness cycles
      anyway.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The above conclusion is based on the hypothetical premise
      of a complete absence of external input into the neurons of the
      brain since the neurons' conception. In reality, that scenario is
      virtually impossible, because at the least the neurons Would be
      able to sense medical variations of the state of the brain itself
      as “internal” input that would be processed and developed upon
      towards an abstract perception of consciousness. In fact, even
      artificially rendering permanent unconsciousness to the brain
      since inception wouldn't make possible that state devoid of all
      input, since as long as the neurons are alive they would still
      automatically collect information from its surroundings,
      including, from within the brain itself, as well as from within
      itself. Of course the quality of consciousness would vary
      depending on the quality of input that it is based on.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] However, the above conclusion is relevant to establishing
      the fact that being aware of the self and therefore being aware
      that one is alive mandates that the brain receive external input
      over a period at some point (at least in the past), as is
      enumerated further below. The mind of a regular human associates
      its sense of “I” with a virtually limitless count of memories that
      it can validate each of either entirely from other memories
      already in the brain related to the same event/entity/experience
      and/or with new input from the five senses. For example, one of
      those associations with one's self identity could be—“I recall
      having placed my finger on a cube of ice in the freezer
      compartment of my kitchen refrigerator a week ago, and my finger
      felt very cold” and “I recall placing my hand on a block of ice in
      the supermarket ten years ago and my finger did feel cold” and
      “Let me go touch snow ice that has collected outdoors in my garden
      this winter morning and let me try to experience if it indeed
      feels cold to the touch”. Each of those two memories correctly
      corroborate with each other affirming the individual's belief in
      the validity of those memories and therefore in the individual's
      identity of self. This is further reinforced by subsequently
      determining that snow ice feels the same to the touch. When the
      brain is totally relaxed, yet awake—that bandwidth of the sense of
      “I” tends to narrow (in the sense that there's a lower count of
      memories of the self active uppermost in the mind). When there's
      total amnesia of past memories and a complete loss of the ability
      to lay down new long term memories, one loses one's sense of
      identity completely, yet one can still function for basic tasks
      with short term memory (which do not contribute to one's self
      identity). A further degeneration of brain abilities would
      ultimately lead towards a gradual to a complete loss of even the
      ability to function.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] A highly relaxed, awake human mind is of course not always
      entirely aware of its identity at any of the uppermost predominant
      layers of consciousness. Such periods typically are no longer than
      a short few seconds. That state is different from when the mind is
      so focused in other deliberations that one's awareness of one's
      own identity ceases to be a priority consideration for the
      duration of that focus, which also typically is no more than a few
      seconds. However, in a matter of seconds, in either case, one's
      identity comes actively back in one's mind at the appropriate
      upper level(s) of awareness. Of course since the levels of
      awareness in one's mind are made up of various layers
      consciousness (most conscious at the highest and least conscious
      at the lowest), self awareness is manifested only in the
      appropriate layers, commensurate with the significance of the need
      to be self aware (per the ongoing deliberations in one's mind, and
      where relevant the external input as well). It is to be noted that
      even while one might not be consciously aware of the more profound
      aspects of one's identity during the stated periods of intense
      alternative focus, one still retains a form of self awareness in
      more simple parameters—by comparing incoming external input with
      short- and long term memory of the same input. For example, that
      awareness continuity could be in the form of a breeze blowing
      across one's face before and then, or some background sound
      persistent before and then, et al.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Therefore, what a human cares for in as much as being alive
      is to be able to CONSCIOUSLY refer back—and therefore naturally
      corroborate across—as many of those memories as is possible, in
      the process not only consciously and subconsciously affirming the
      individual's self identity but laying new memories (in the form of
      plans, etc) towards feeling positive about one's self identity in
      the long run on the whole. The latter is of course achieved in a
      complex combination of learnt behaviors (outside the scope of this
      Patent Application) that ultimately release the “feel good”
      neurotransmitter et al chemicals in the brain (e.g.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (A). learning that society currently affirms that one must
      love and take good care of one's child and therefore one must do
      good to one's child, based on which genuine love for the child
      develops (albeit that love also develops in the absence of society
      based on other aspects related to memory in the human mind),
      therefore doing good to one's child or seeing the child happy
      releases those feel-good chemicals in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] (B). learning that society encourages success, hence
      planning for and attaining success releases those feel-good
      chemicals in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Therefore, that self identity (and not the brain hardware
      associated with it) is what constitutes being a particular human,
      and it is that self identity that the invention described in this
      Patent Application focuses on perpetually transferring
      sequentially, towards life's persistence in perpetuity. To be
      noted is that brain hardware is of course critical for that
      identity processing to be done, and subtle variations in the
      hardware of the brain would cause subtle changes in the perception
      of one's self-identity even with everything else remaining the
      same—for example if a pair of (genetically identical) clones were
      kept in the same environment since inception, they would NOT
      develop to have the exact identical memory banks or personality.
      However, the applicant infers that most brains' hardware is
      acceptably identical within reasonable limits in the context of
      this processing (distinguishing a human brain from, say, a dog's
      brain or—as an extreme incompatible example—a latest modern day
      supercomputer), rendering it possible that most brains be
      acceptably compatible to process that transferred self-identity in
      as much as their being able to reasonably manifest the original
      human's self awareness and traits.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] For feasibility, this invention uses the brain's existing
      abilities and properties towards that transfer, as elaborated
      subsequently in this Patent Application.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The quality of human consciousness containing (by
      definition) one's self identity, even for the same individual, is
      plastic. There are multiple, non-discrete qualitative levels of
      increasing or decreasing consciousness. In all cases when one can
      reasonably identify oneself, one ultimately normally has a
      positive experience with one's being alive and awake, hence it
      would be any of these states of consciousness (where one can
      meaningfully identify oneself) that would need to be transferred
      in the context of immortality. However, when there is no sense of
      self identity at all (when, for example, there's total amnesia of
      past events associated with a complete inability to lay any new
      memory) even while the ability to otherwise fully function with
      short term memory alone is retained, the state would not be
      meaningful to transfer towards immortality because there is no
      self identity in such a case.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Key Feasibility Controls</b><br>
      <br>
      [0032] At the core of this invention are the following controls
      that render this invention feasible—<br>
      <br>
      [0033] (i.) The applicant's inference that what constitutes being
      any particular human is Not tied to any one physical brain, but
      the awareness of memory content and new external input towards
      direct and indirect self-recognition (i.e. consciousness of the
      self) and learned reactive rules (i.e. personality, which to a
      major extent is essentially a manifestation of consciousness of
      the self) (more importantly the former, because human personality
      can be modified/learnt later but critical information needs to be
      retained if self-identifying memories have to be passed on) that
      can each be Consciously (and Otherwise, primarily the
      former)—While the Original Brain is Alive—Rendered Familiar with a
      New Brain's Hardware and its Information Content, Integrated for
      Functioning (While Still Keeping the Original Information
      Separately Identifiable) with the New Information Content and
      Hardware of the Second Brain Along with the Original Brain
      Hardware. This Process can be Extended to Beyond a Set of Just Two
      Brains. Consequent to that and the other controls listed in this
      section the Applicant's Inference that any One Original Brain is
      able to Consciously (and Otherwise, primarily the former),
      Following the Stated Integration with One or More Additional
      Brains (&amp; the Information Contained Therein), Choose One of
      Those Brains to Base its Consciousness (and therefore personality
      too) On. That is Based on the Fact that Each Individual Human
      Brain Constitutes a Reasonable Minimal Hardware that is able to
      Support Adequate Human Consciousness by Itself, Albeit the Quality
      of that Consciousness is Expected to be Slightly Inferior to the
      Integrated Consciousness Attained with Multiple Brains.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] (ii.) The applicant's inference that there cannot be more
      than one integrated center of consciousness (that, by definition,
      acknowledges complete self identity) for any living entity at any
      one time. There can be multiple separate integrated centers of
      consciousness, each of which could in principle separately take
      complete control of one's entire core consciousness at different
      points of time, but only one can he the sole integrated center of
      consciousness at any one time. To rephrase, There can be at Most
      be One Logical (and hence PHYSICAL (which crucially doesn't
      entirely HAVE to be at one location—just that the constituent
      physical components need to not be physically delinked)) Center of
      Consciousness for any Living Entity at any One Point of Time. To
      rephrase, in the context of the human, when a set of integrated
      brains (manifesting an integrated center of consciousness) are
      physically delinked, the consciousness of that set can at best be
      transferred to AT MOST one human brain's center of consciousness
      (or—if chosen—an integrated, augmented logical center of
      consciousness formed of interlinked centers of consciousness of
      multiple regular brains) (and at worst to no human brain at
      all—the integrated consciousness, would just be destroyed), in as
      much as a human brain is considered the minimum (but NOT the
      maximum) physical hardware capable of adequately hosting a
      comprehensive center of human consciousness that (i.e. the
      consciousness) can be fully independent of reliance on any other
      hardware (i.e. any other brain), as is the case with every known
      regular human brain today. This for example, is to contrast the
      regular human brain from that of a primate in much as the latter
      being incapable of physically hosting a human-quality center of
      consciousness. Again, that is not to state that consciousness WILL
      be transferred to one brain even if not desired, but only that AT
      MOST one center of consciousness (spanning one or multiple brains)
      can have the integrated consciousness transferred to (if
      applicable/necessary at a slightly inferior quality, but adequate
      and comparable to the quality of consciousness in any regular
      human brain). Again, it is important to note that in principle it
      is 100% possible that if so elected an integrated center of
      consciousness can be transferred to span across multiple human
      brains whereby the multiple brains would either together host a
      SINGLE integrated center of consciousness or independently host
      separate centers of consciousness only one of which would take
      full control at any one point of time, however such would render
      this invention less practicable and less useful. because of the
      then need for perpetual communication and cooperation among
      multiple brains that typically would also imply the requirement of
      the same count of independent, perpetually collaborating humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] (iii.) The already publicly recognized ability of the brain
      to attempt to functionally optimally (i.e. as best as is possible
      given the tissues and other aspects of the scenario) communicate
      with neurons not part of that brain, and with the quality of
      communication augmented in a technology enabled environment. This
      has been independently evidenced in various
      attempted-regenerative/“curative” procedures involving the
      cerebrospinal system.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] (iv.) The brain's already publicly recognized ability to
      still function optimally (as best as is possible) without the
      original entirety of the brain, on account of information content
      multi-duplication and redundancy across the brain, brain hardware
      redundancy and brain hardware function flexibility. This is
      evidenced in cases of traumatic brain injury or surgical removal
      of brain components.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] (v.) The (human) brain's already recognized ability to
      learn to do just about anything, with and/or without conscious
      will. There is ho dearth of evidence on the brain's remarkable
      learning abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Specific Steps in Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Step 1—Link Brains to Communicate</b><br>
      <br>
      [0038] [Key Feasibility Control Applied—(iii.)] (Ref. “Key
      Feasibility Controls”)<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Mary-I is to be linked to the new brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The intention is that subsequently, per Step 2, Mary-I's
      brain naturally integrates (enabled by appropriate, minimal
      external technology support (Ref. “Technology supported interbrain
      communication”)), as far as optimal logical functioning, with the
      brain of the second individual towards jointly forming an
      augmented logical neural network, essentially aimed at rendering
      the two brains capable of functioning as one, while still
      maintaining their separate identities at will.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In order to be meaningful (for example for protection from
      transmissible terminal illnesses like hepatitis, cancer tissue,
      HIV etc) this integration will Not mandate a direct tissue
      connection, but instead can even be achieved with wires, or even
      entirely wirelessly.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Step 2—Learn to Use Other Brain, Towards Forming (Together
      with Mary-I's Own Brain) an Integrated, (Virtual) Single,
      Augmented, Logical Brain Containing an Integrated, Augmented,
      Logical Center of Consciousness<br>
      [Key Feasibility Controls Applied—(i.), (ii.), (iii.), (v.)] (Ref.
      “Key Feasibility Controls”)<br>
      <br>
      [0042] This is the most critical component of this invention,
      whereby each of the two connected brains would, using a
      combination of the appropriate, minimal external technology
      support and optimal mental effort by way of using the brains'
      natural ability to learn and optimally integrate with new
      hardware, gradually recognize the hardware and information content
      of the other brain, towards forming a single, augmented, logical
      brain with a single, augmented, integrated logical center of
      consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] That single, augmented, integrated logical center of
      consciousness will include, in whole or in (typically the most)
      part, the logical center of consciousness of each individual
      brain, and (typically) an additional consciousness component
      originally present in neither of the two original centers of
      consciousness. That additional consciousness component may
      preferably be reduced or eliminated for the integrated, augmented
      consciousness to maintain acceptable fidelity to the logical
      integration of the original set of consciousnesses.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The aim of this step is to establish one logical center of
      consciousness (while still consciously and otherwise retaining the
      separate identities) for the combined brain at any one point of
      time, such that it can be switched on or off at will (by the
      combined single logical center of consciousness, with
      (importantly—so that the rights and will of each original human
      are never compromised at any point) each original separate logical
      center of consciousness retaining full overriding control on its
      own share of original physical resources and original information
      content) to return back to the state of the two separate logical
      centers of consciousness. In short, the combined logical center of
      consciousness will happen only if both original separate centers
      of consciousness agree, while never losing awareness of and
      control on their separate original identities (i.e. on the
      separate original logical centers of consciousness), and should
      one of those identities wish to exit the combo it could. The combo
      would essentially remain an optimally integrated sum of two
      separately distinguishable parts that could choose to either
      separate or work together—with each maintaining the critical
      ability to recognize and influence the other. So there is an
      element of trust involved, necessitating a correct selection of
      the two original human candidates, and it would be meaningful that
      with that selection correctly done the logic of mutual- and
      overall good would largely prevent infraction of rights by the
      combined logical center of consciousness of its separate always
      identifiable component original centers of consciousness: in fact,
      it would also be easy for each brain's consciousness to willfully
      deny detrimental “takeover” against its will by another brain's
      consciousness, much though not exactly the same way for example
      the Autonomic Nervous System in any standalone individual
      optimally controls that individual's heart rate, digestion etc
      without direct conscious control by that individual's
      consciousness albeit the individual would still be appropriately
      aware of the individual's heart rate, digestion, etc. In other
      words, the consciousness combo in the combined logical center of
      consciousness would remain appropriately aware of each component
      center of consciousness and be able to control that component
      center of consciousness to an extent appropriately less than the
      extent of its awareness of it. As an additional option, that
      awareness by the integrated center of consciousness of each
      component center of consciousness and consequently of the human
      body originally attached to each respective component center of
      consciousness can be but does not have to be 100%—in other words
      it could be but doesn't have to be that sections of a component
      center of consciousness and consequently of the original human
      body attached to that component center of consciousness remain
      completely out of bounds of the integrated center of
      consciousness, not just in Step 2 but even at the conclusion of
      Step 3. That one logical center of consciousness could be
      physically located at either brain, or in both combined—of course
      ideally the former for portability logistics so that Mary-I's
      original brain hardware could be completely disregarded at will
      (if so chosen by the stated combined single logical center of
      consciousness, (pre-) approved by Mary-I).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] After the two brains have been linked to communicate so
      that the process of logical functional integration could begin,
      the next step would be for Mary-I to consciously (and
      sub-/unconsciously) familiarize with the second brain's hardware's
      peculiarities and with the information content therein, and
      consequently “learn” to cogitate using “both” her existing brain
      as well as the second brain's hardware resources and information
      content. This process could last several hours up to multiple days
      (in sessions), in the earlier phases of implementation of this
      invention, and would expectedly very significantly speed up with
      improvements in supporting technology later. The stated processes
      of logical integration and learning by both the two brains would
      proceed at the same time. The neurons of the brains would know how
      to optimally integrate and function jointly, as long as a potent
      communication environment (outlined separately in this Patent
      Application) is provided. At the end of the process, the brains
      would be deemed to have provisionally been functionally integrated
      towards optimal logical operations as one (virtual) single,
      augmented brain. That virtual single brain would have two separate
      physical centers of consciousness of course (that would, at mutual
      consensus as part of the process of learning, switch off or on
      alternately and simultaneously as part of that learning), and
      Mary-I's brain and the other brain would each learn to recognize
      the logical consciousness center of the other brain, and as part
      of the familiarization process grant alternating permission for
      trial control of consciousness and data (i.e. retrieving and
      adding memory, processing new input from body etc.) by the other
      brain's center of consciousness. Essentially Mary-I's sense of
      self identity would now include recognizing new data and brain
      behavior that were not originally hers and which she would
      reasonably “tag” as such (i.e. she would not confuse new
      information in the second brain with her own original information
      in her brain, instead she would tag new information as not
      originally hers and simply learn to deal with that information
      while maintaining her identity in the integrated logical combo).
      As part of the integration, she would also learn to recognize and
      work with the other brain's different physical components and data
      therein towards manifesting her own original personality, to the
      extent that her original personality would need to be reasonably
      exhibited at will following the transfer. While a significant
      portion of the learning will be in conscious states, part of the
      learning will be in sub-/unconscious states as well. This process
      of “learning” towards a logically integrated single (virtual)
      brain with a single (virtual) logically integrated center of
      consciousness made up of the always identifiable separate original
      two logical centers of consciousness (with two physical centers of
      consciousness that will not always be either simultaneously awake
      or simultaneously asleep, by mutual consensus) where each brain
      learns to recognize and work with the other brain's physical
      components and data therein towards manifesting one's original
      self-identity and personality and other adequately significant
      aspects of oneself using one's own and the other brain's hardware,
      and identifies and tags the other brain's information content as
      not being one's own original memory, and with the combined single
      logical center of consciousness maintaining the ability to be
      switched on or off at will (by the combined single logical center
      of consciousness itself (or by one/more individual component
      original logical center(s) of consciousness where applicable),
      with (importantly—so that the rights and will of each original
      human are never compromised at any point) each original separate
      logical center of consciousness retaining full overriding control
      on its own share of original physical resources and original
      information content) to therefore enable a return to the original
      state of two separate logical centers of consciousness (if so
      desired), is the first significant step of this process. Post
      transfer, the traits of either Mary-II-B or the original second
      individual would be manifested at will whenever chosen. In effect,
      the “better” traits would ordinarily manifest (again, largely at
      will)—for example if Mary-I was level headed and the second
      individual originally was less so, then the combo would be level
      headed at will, and if Mary-I was poor in Math while the second
      individual was not then the combo would not have to be poor in
      Math.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The centromedian nucleus, which is part of the ILN
      (Intra-Laminar Nucleus) of the thalamus, is already recognized in
      the medical community today as an important center of
      consciousness in the human brain. Since, as part of the “learning”
      phase, the two separate brains would need aim to function as one
      with preferably hut not necessarily one physical center of
      consciousness (towards attaining the post-learning-completed
      requirement of having one logical center of consciousness for the
      combo at any one point of time, albeit with the combo's never
      losing awareness of the two separate identities), the applicant
      recommends enabling neural networking that allows the two
      centromedian nuclei and other separate components that all jointly
      constitute the two integrated centers of consciousness in the two
      brains to both remain functional (to allow for both the
      independent brains to learn to recognize and “learn” each other
      and consequently enable both operate jointly as one center of
      consciousness and also separately as two separate centers of
      consciousness that each brain would be able to sense both of), as
      well as alternatively temporarily disabling the integrated center
      of consciousness in each brain. For part of the process, both
      brains' centers of consciousness would optionally need to be
      simultaneously disabled (naturally as sleep, and artificially with
      technology support) to allow natural, enhanced with technology
      support, optimized information dissemination from the other brain
      into each brain. During the process, information from the second
      brain would be naturally, enhanced with technology support,
      optimally integrated with Mary-I's brain, and vice versa,
      resulting in Mary-I's being able to consciously sense and
      deliberate with memories in the second brain and sense and process
      input from the second body. The second brain would be able to do
      the same with memory in Mary-I's brain and input from Mary-I's
      body.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Mary-I and the other individual could be geographically
      located separately anywhere (albeit in the earlier incidences of
      implementation of the mechanism in this Patent Application they
      should be in proximity), and at the conclusion of the process of
      that optimal functional integration, Mary-I and the second human
      would each have a voluntary (i.e. it can be switched on and off at
      will), augmented cognitive ability primarily Solely (i.e. in the
      most part) using the physical resources of the other brain. The
      centers of consciousness of the two separate brains would also be
      able to at will operate as one or separately. At that stage,
      either Mary-I or the other individual, could be relocated to the
      other brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The applicant emphasizes that in this invention
      dual-directional transfer is more recommended than unidirectional,
      towards a higher degree of potency of the process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] Step 3—Relocate to Second Brain and Physically
        Disassociate from Original Brain</b><br>
      <br>
      [Key Feasibility Controls Applied—(i.), (ii.), (iii.), (iv.),
      (v.). The notable inclusion of (iv.) is relevant for reasons of
      the reduction (by way of disassociation from the original brain
      (hence from the center of consciousness therein)) of the
      augmented, integrated, logical brain (hence of the augmented,
      integrated, logical center of consciousness) of Step 2] (Ref. “Key
      feasibility controls”)<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The sequence of the two operations in this Step 3 surmised
      in the step title above is important—relocation at will happens
      first, physical disassociation with the original brain happens
      next.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] With the two brains having already been functionally
      integrated in Step 2 towards the creation of one logical,
      augmented, integrated single center of consciousness (that will
      also have, to appropriate extents, retained awareness of and
      control on the separate original identities), it would be
      necessary here to get the two brains' centers of consciousness
      suitably collaborating towards confirming with Mary-I that she can
      acceptably sense an integrated consciousness using the centers of
      consciousness and memory in both the brains and input from both
      the bodies and then checking that the same responses are
      consciously made representing Mary-I from the second individual.
      Next, Mary-I would consciously (and otherwise, with external
      technology support) actively “relocate” in a highly focused,
      deliberated and conscious fashion to the augmented, integrated,
      logical center of consciousness and voluntarily (by focused
      deliberation or otherwise, with external technology support)
      disable (or render less relevant) her own brain's center of
      consciousness thereby gradually relinquishing control of self
      identity from her own brain and allowing self identity to be
      processed from the augmented, integrated, logical center of
      consciousness (which by then would essentially comprise of, in
      whole or in (typically the most) part, the logical center of
      consciousness of the second brain, and (typically) an additional
      consciousness component (that, as indicated elsewhere in this
      Patent Application, may be reduced or eliminated) originally
      present in neither of the two original centers of consciousness)
      such that when her original brain is then disassociated her
      consciousness (and hence by definition her self-identity) would
      all the while have remained active in the other brain, she
      becoming Mary-II-B. Implementing the process while conscious per
      the critical procedural preference stated above would render the
      process reasonably safe in the sense that Mary-I would
      definitively know that she has transferred to the second brain
      prior to her death.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Step 4—Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for Essential Immortality</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0051] Mary-II-B can repeat the three steps 1-3 at an appropriate
      time before the physical death of her new body. This cycle of 4
      steps is continued, to render Mary-I effectively immortal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Considerations</b><br>
      <br>
      [0052] To be noted here is that memory/personality information in
      the sections of the brain that are not relevant to conscious
      cognition (e.g. breathing, swallowing, etc) will be given a lower
      priority for transfer. The reason for that is that while those
      components do have a minor contribution to self identity, that
      contribution is relatively minimal. Most of these lesser
      significant to self-identity inadequately cognitive body functions
      would be directly taken up by the host body's already existing
      capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fair Scope of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] Without limiting itself to (i.e. irrespective of) any
      specific support hardware, this Patent Application covers the
      four-step process earlier detailed, even when more than two brains
      are involved. The latter is possible, per discussions in this
      Patent Application, if for example Mary-I chooses to link to
      multiple (and not just one) other brains towards forming an
      integrated brain with an integrated consciousness center, prior to
      delinking from them all into one brain (or—not
      recommended—multiple brains, towards an integrated, augmented
      center of consciousness) of her choice to form Mary-II-B.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In short, this Patent Application encompasses not only all
      morphs/variations/renditions/forms/flavors of the combination of
      the three steps (Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3) with and without Step
      4—enumerated in the section “Specific steps in invention”—but also
      (all morphs/variations/renditions/forms/flavors) of the following
      core sequence of three steps Step A, Step B and Step C, with and
      without Step D (that together constitute an adequate, accurate
      superset to the steps in “Specific steps in invention”), in the
      premise of, but not limited by, the applicant's comprehensive
      logic, details, options and variations elaborated in the entirety
      of this Patent Application. As is self evident, all applications
      of existing or future technologies in the context of all
      morphs/variations/renditions/forms/flavors of the sequence of
      three steps—Step A, Step B and Step C—with and without Step D, are
      included in the scope of this Patent Application. Notably, Step B
      and Step C by themselves or together in any sequence, whether or
      not preceded by Step A and succeeded by Step D are also included
      in the scope of this Patent Application. Step A by itself is
      covered in the Patent Application only to the extent that it is
      relevant to medically perpetual persistence of essential human
      life as detailed in this Patent Application, as well as to the
      form of connection outlined in (and therefore may be lawfully
      expanded or extrapolated on as being included in this Patent
      Application's scope) Step 1 of “Specific steps in invention”. Step
      A and elsewhere in this Patent Application and to the application
      of interbrain communicating technologies described in “Technology
      supported interbrain communication” and elsewhere in this Patent
      Application. In extension, of “Specific steps in invention” Step 2
      and Step 3 by themselves or together in any sequence, whether or
      not preceded by Step 1 and succeeded by Step 4 are also included
      in the scope of this Patent Application. Step 1 by itself is
      covered only to the extent that it is relevant to medically
      perpetual persistence of essential human life as detailed in this
      Patent Application as well as to the form of connection outlined
      in (and therefore may be lawfully expanded or extrapolated on as
      being included in this Patent Application's scope) that Step 1 of
      “Specific steps in invention” and elsewhere in this Patent
      Application and to the application of interbrain communicating
      technologies described in “Technology supported interbrain
      communication” and elsewhere in this Patent Application. However
      the technologies themselves, to the extent not discussed in this
      Patent Application and to the extent not applied towards all
      morphs/variations/renditions/forms/flavors of one or more of the
      three steps below (Step A [except when Step A is excluded from the
      Patent Application's scope as described above]. Step B and Step C,
      in any sequence, with or without Step D) would be outside the
      scope of this Patent Application. Again, the novelty and hence the
      scope of this Patent Application is not limited to the application
      of the supporting technologies towards the steps below and
      (application) to the steps in “Specific steps in invention”, but
      importantly includes the steps themselves. The novelty of the
      steps is MORE significant than the novelty of the application of
      the technologies themselves towards manifesting those steps.
      However, the fact that the invention entails the use of technology
      as a necessary aspect of each of the four steps contributes to
      enabling the invention's lawful patentability.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] A. Mary-I's brain is linked to one other brain, or multiple
      other brains.<br>
      <br>
      [Key Feasibility Control Applied, Appropriately
      Extrapolated—(iii.)] (Ref. “Key Feasibility Controls”)<br>
      <br>
      B. Mary-I learns (using a combination of (various levels of)
      conscious-, various levels of subconscious-, and (various levels
      of) unconscious-initiatives with technology support) to use other
      brain(s), towards forming one integrated, augmented brain (or a
      combination of communicating integrated, augmented brain systems)
      containing one integrated, augmented, logical center of
      consciousness (or a combination of communicating, integrated,
      augmented, logical centers of consciousness, only one of which
      would have authority over the set of participating brains in that
      particular augmented, integrated, logical center of consciousness,
      at any one time). Each integrated, augmented, logical center of
      consciousness would comprise of in whole or in (typically the
      most) part, the logical center of consciousness (hence include an
      appropriate fraction of the consciousness component therein of the
      associated brain) of each individual constituent brain, and
      (typically) an additional minor consciousness component (that may
      preferably be reduced or eliminated for the integrated, augmented
      consciousness to maintain acceptable fidelity to the logical
      integration of the original set of consciousnesses) originally
      associated with none of the constituent brains. Each integrated,
      augmented, logical center of consciousness will be physically
      located across one or up to all of the individual single original
      centers of consciousness in each constituent brains—preferably
      (for upcoming (per Step C) Mary-II-B's logistical convenience) in
      exactly one of the constituent brains' centers of
      consciousness—and only one integrated, augmented, logical center
      of consciousness may control a constituent brain at any one point
      of time, even though that brain may be part of multiple separate
      integrated, augmented, logical centers of consciousness. As part
      of that learning Mary-I would consciously, subconsciously and
      unconsciously adequately recognize herself (inclusive of all, most
      or an acceptable extent of her key original memories) using the
      (and each, when multiple) integrated, augmented, logical center(s)
      of consciousness—hence the logical center(s) of consciousness in
      the other brain(s). That recognition would alternatively be, at
      Mary-I's conscious/subconscious/unconscious initiative/will, using
      some/all the centers of consciousness (i.e. at will, including her
      original own and the other(s) and separately using only the
      other(s) and not her original own). As indicated at the top of
      “B”, at the end of this step will be formed one integrated,
      augmented brain (or a combination of communicating integrated,
      augmented brain systems) including Mary-I's brain, containing one
      integrated, augmented, logical center of consciousness (or a
      combination of communicating, integrated, augmented, logical
      centers of consciousness, only one of which would have authority
      over the set of participating brains in that particular augmented,
      integrated, logical center of consciousness, at any one time).<br>
      <br>
      [Key Feasibility Controls Applied, Appropriately
      Extrapolated—(i.), (ii.), (iii.), (v.)] (Ref. “Key Feasibility
      Controls”)<br>
      <br>
      C. Mary-I chooses a logical center of consciousness if multiple
      individual logical centers of consciousness have been created in
      step B., “relocates” to it, logically disassociates from Mary-I's
      original brain (i.e. from the original center of consciousness of
      Mary-I) (Note—while a physical disassociation from Mary-I's brain
      is not mandatory, that will typically ultimately follow), and
      therefore manifests Mary-II-B within that chosen logical center of
      consciousness. The logical center of consciousness would ideally
      be located physically in just one of those other (i.e. non-Mary-I)
      brains—hence in the center of consciousness therein that one
      brain—for enhanced logistical convenience of Mary-II-B (but could
      in principle be located in more than one of those brains as well,
      as long as they're logically linked forming one integrated,
      augmented, center of consciousness). At the and of that transfer
      Mary-I's brain will be logically, and in practice often
      physically, disassociated from the integrated, augmented, logical
      center of consciousness that Mary-II-B has relocated to.<br>
      <br>
      [Key Feasibility Controls Applied, Appropriately
      Extrapolated—(i.), (ii.), (iii.), (iv.), (v.). The notable
      inclusion of (iv.) is relevant for reasons of the reduction (by
      way of disassociation from the original brain (hence from the
      center of consciousness therein)) of the augmented, integrated,
      logical brain (hence of the augmented, integrated, logical center
      of consciousness) of Step B] (Ref. “Key feasibility controls”)<br>
      D. For essential immortality of Mary-I, Mary-II-B will repeat
      steps A, B and C at an appropriate time prior to the physical
      death of Mary-II-B's (new) body. The cycle of 4 steps is repeated
      for as long as Mary-I is wished to be kept alive.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] To clarify scope, while the manifestation of Mary-II-B is
      complexly covered within the scope of this Patent Application, the
      manifestation of Mary-II-A in itself is not covered in the scope
      of this Patent Application as long the scope of this Patent
      Application detailed in the rest of this section (“Fair scope of
      invention”) is otherwise rigorously applied—to rephrase, the use
      of morphs/variations/renditions/forms/flavors of the stated
      four-step process towards the creation of Mary-II-A is covered in
      this Patent Application's scope.<br>
      <br>
      Proof of
      Feasibility/Tangibility/Concreteness/Originality/Innovation, Hence
      Patentability<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The sections “Key feasibility controls” and “What is self
      identity and how is that relevant to perpetual persistence of
      life?” outline the primary bases of feasibility. Additional
      feasibility considerations are in the sections “Recommendations”,
      “Deliberations &amp; clarifications” and “Technology enabled
      interbrain communication”. “Specific steps in invention” and “Fair
      Scope of invention” make explicit application of the bases of
      feasibility surmised in “Key feasibility controls”.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The proof of tangibility is of course in the perpetual
      continuity of life this invention achieves.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The proof of concreteness is in the specific four steps
      listed in the sections “Fair Scope of invention” and “Specific
      steps in invention”.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The proof of originality and innovation is of course in the
      very fact that feasible, tangible and concrete perpetual
      persistence of essential human life constitutes this invention,
      because perpetual persistence of human life has never been
      possible yet in any other invention by humankind.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] While the novelty of the overall four steps of the
      invention is substantially more significant than the novelty of
      the application of the technologies themselves as part of the
      invention towards manifesting those steps, the integration of such
      appropriate technologies as a necessary aspect of each of the four
      steps of the invention, therefore and otherwise rendering the
      overall invention original, innovative, feasible, tangible and
      concrete, contributes to enabling the invention's lawful
      patentability. Additional details on feasibility could be provided
      upon request—reflecting that it is appropriate to neither limit
      the applicable technologies nor immediately build a physical
      prototype because:<br>
      <br>
      Many different technology options are currently feasible for this
      invention, with and/or without the relevant follow up
      insignificant (and/or optionally significant), time spanning,
      observation and analysis, whereby the immediate patentability of
      this invention remains entirely undiminished, and is in fact
      augmented, by such follow up—and other technical considerations.<br>
      <br>
      A complete physical prototype would be feasible if sufficient
      funding, time and direct and/or at least indirect public will (for
      example, but not limited to, in terms of a commercial end user
      market for the invention) are confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      The immediate building of a physical prototype is as unnecessary
      to affirming the validity (i.e. originality, novelty, feasibility,
      tangibility and concreteness)—and hence the patentability—of this
      invention as would be, for example, for any other entirely
      unrelated invention (not in the scope of this Patent Application)
      whose originality, novelty, feasibility, tangibility and
      concreteness are entirely self evident, yet building a physical
      prototype would require the availability of funds, time and/or at
      least indirect public will.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recommendations</b><br>
      <br>
      [0064] It is important to note that as part of the applicant's
      considerations on quick implementation feasibility the applicant
      emphasizes on the following—<br>
      <br>
      Recommends that consciousness be preferably transferred across
      existing brains of reasonable maturity. Of course the more similar
      the second brain is to Mary-I's original brain (if largely
      “regular”), the better would the quality of Mary-II-B be—and if
      Mary-I's original brain is less than regular (e.g. from a
      congenital- or injury induced hardware shortcoming) then the
      target brain to transfer to should ideally be regular. Of course
      the younger the second individual would be, generally the better,
      in order to increase the likelihood of minimizing the frequency of
      such transfers (including, but not limited to, by delaying the
      onset of normal “old age” post transfer). If inter-brain
      communication is aggressively tuned per the direction outlined in
      this Patent Application, the applicant infers that the creation of
      Mary-II-B will begin being possible any time within 8 or 10 years.<br>
      <br>
      Includes the possibility of rendering consciousness transfer
      across clones, which in principle would be the ideal form of
      consciousness transfer. That is because the technology to create
      clones is available today, and it would be supportive of this
      invention to create a young Mary-II-B when Mary-I has already
      reached a relatively senior age.<br>
      Strictly excludes fancy considerations like transferring to a
      computer. That is not practical simply because the inherent
      hardware design of the modern day computer vastly reduces the
      likelihood of the hardware being able to sufficiently
      multi-process with extremely low consumption of energy to render
      the computer portable and otherwise feasible. In short, the modern
      day computer is completely counter to hosting cognition even
      remotely as optimally as human cognition in the human brain—the
      best modern day supercomputer does unacceptably more work than the
      human brain would for the same job.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Deliberations &amp; Clarifications</b><br>
      <br>
      [0068] Important considerations in this invention are the
      following—<br>
      <br>
      a. The same brain and body resources cannot be set to be
      simultaneously controlled by two separate logical consciousness
      centers. At most only one logical center of consciousness can take
      control at any one time. In extension, there can at one point be
      only one (integrated) logical (i.e. constituent components not
      physically delinked) center of consciousness as far as self
      identity is concerned. Refer “f.” below.<br>
      b. It is not necessary for every bit of information in Mary-I's
      brain to be transferred to the second human. That is because human
      memory and personality are both plastic and are changeable. As
      long as a reasonable amount of information is transferred that
      would enable Mary-II-B to acceptably recognize herself, that would
      constitute a good start. Innate human cognitive capabilities would
      then naturally do the needful to attempt to build up a new memory
      bank and personality using that information. With the passage of
      time as newer and faster information transfer techniques are
      developed, Mary-II-B's brain (excluding prior information already
      in the second brain) would more closely represent Mary-I's brain
      at the time of transfer.<br>
      <br>
      c. The technology to clone any human organ is already available
      today. Therefore, if the center of consciousness (namely the
      centromedian nucleus and allied components) for any human brain
      were cloned and connected in parallel to the same endpoints in the
      rest of that specific brain (namely sending nerve fibers to the
      cerebral cortex, putamen, caudate, collateral fibers etc. and
      receiving nerve fibers from the spinothalamic tract, cerebral
      cortex, superior colliculus, reticular formation, globus pallidus,
      vestibular nuclei etc.), would the sense of “I” be adequately
      realized in the cloned center of consciousness such that the two
      parallel centers of consciousness could operate in the following
      ways?<br>
      1. As one combined augmented logical center of consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      2. As two separate logical centers of consciousness where each
      center remains aware of the other center and complete control of
      the resources (and hence of one's consciousness, and hence, by
      definition, of one's self identity) by any one center at one time
      is taken by voluntary joint consensus.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The applicant infers that the answer to both is “Yes”.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] As an extension, “1,” would be possible differently if the
      cloned center of consciousness were not just connected at the ends
      with the original but entirely merged with the original.<br>
      <br>
      d. If, in addition to the center of consciousness, the rest of the
      entire brain were cloned too, such that initially each component
      still remained functionally part of the corresponding original
      brain such that the entire brain functioned as a “super” brain
      with one consciousness, and then if the two sets of components
      were separated to form two separate exactly similar brains, would
      the original single sense of consciousnesses be copied in both
      brains and if so how would it be in relation to the original
      single sense of identity?<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Obviously, with no physical connection between the two
      brains, the hitherto similar manifestations of the same
      consciousness would thenceforth develop into two distinct flavors
      of consciousnesses in separate ways from the point of separation.
      The original sense of self identity could remain in any one of the
      two brains, but never in both the physically disconnected brains
      at the same time. To rephrase, Mary-II-B can be manifested in at
      most one of the two physically disassociated brains.<br>
      <br>
      e. Mary-I should select the individual to transfer to well in
      advance of her anticipated death, and effect transfer of all
      meaningful long term memory in advance. Following that, Mary-I
      should periodically transfer further long term memory since
      accumulated. Ideally this whole process should be undertaken with
      at least two geographically apart individuals to minimize the risk
      or not ultimately having any individual available to transfer to
      just prior to Mary-I's death.<br>
      <br>
      f. Could Mary-I be transferred to multiple third party brains? The
      applicant infers that the answer is “NO” as far as Mary-II-B, but
      ‘yes’ in the context if Mary-II-A. There HAS to be at most one
      single logical (i.e. constituent physical components not delinked)
      center of consciousness where one can acceptably-self-identifiably
      transfer to at any one point of time. Therefore, while it is
      possible for multiple brains to function together as a whole (as
      earlier detailed), there HAS to be only one logical center of
      consciousness for them all as far as acceptable
      self-identification. That integrated logical center of
      consciousness doesn't have to necessarily physically be entirely
      in any one of the linked multiple brains, but suitably distributed
      across them all—non-functional individually but functional as a
      whole. Therefore when the physical link between the brains is
      broken—the actual transfer (towards Mary-II-B) would AT BEST be in
      only one brain—the other physically delinked brains can AT BEST
      have COPIES (towards Mary-II-A, that, as earlier elaborated, would
      not be acceptably-self-identifiable) of that original identity
      where SEPARATE, independent development would proceed from that
      point of physical disassociation. AT WORST, the transfer wouldn't
      happen at all, and the original individuals would just be left
      with new memories that they'd recognize as not theirs (since the
      memories would not involve them, but primarily Mary-I, and
      secondarily some of the other people in the set). What would NOT
      HAPPEN is Mary-II-B's manifestation in more than one separate
      brains.<br>
      <br>
      g. Could, following a transfer, Mary-I separately sense herself
      being present in both her original brain and in the second brain
      that is no longer connected to her own still alive brain? This is
      an extension of sub-query “d.” and “f.” above, and the answer is
      “No”—she can be transferred as Mary-II-B to another brain while
      still alive, as long as she volunteers to let her own brain's
      center of consciousness give up control of her consciousness to
      the second brain's center of consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      h. In the context of a brain that has been devoid of all forms of
      external input to it since inception, would that brain have
      medically wake and sleep cycles, and if so would the brain have
      dreams in those sleep cycles? Extending upon the behavior of a
      human baby in the womb, it can be reasonably presumed that the
      brain probably would have sleep and wakefulness cycles, simply
      because that property appears to be genetically so entrenched in
      the system that it would manifest itself regardless of input. As
      far as dreams—the applicant infers that an entirely-input-devoid
      brain does not logically appear to be capable of any cogitation
      because there would be no basic rules framework in the brain's
      memory database that can be used to cogitate with—and since
      cognition appears to be logically impossible, dreams in the way we
      know it appear to be impossible as well. In other words, there
      would potentially be no meaningful difference between that brain's
      state of wakefulness and sleep/dreams. However, this inference is
      not directly related to this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technology Enabled Interbrain Communication</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0082] The applicant infers that it is feasible to have two
      separate brains (learn to) communicate ((at least) initially with
      active conscious will, to enable the brains learn to recognize the
      signals and hence the communications mechanism) in a micro-focused
      electromagnetic communications environment of multiple
      simultaneous signals of the appropriate strengths and frequencies
      focused at equivalent brain components in the two brains, as
      briefly expounded in the following paragraph. Although
      neurotransmitters could potentially be used to render the process
      more potent, the applicant deems that essentially unnecessary
      given that the electromagnetic signals received would anyway
      enable the natural generation of the appropriate neurotransmitters
      as the brains deem necessary to process those signals.
      Essentially, the detected output signals from the relevant
      components of one brain would need to be appropriately modulated
      and micro-focused on the appropriate input components of the other
      brain. That modulated input would be in the form of ultra-low
      voltage signals at compatible frequencies and strengths (and
      duration for transfer effectiveness (because transfer will not
      always be real time, but suitably time lagged mandated by the
      complexity (i.e. relevant ranges of frequency and strength mapped
      to physiological zones) of the “sending” brain's emanated signals,
      the fuzzy logic feedback learning based, identification of the
      “receiving” brain's internal physiological locations, modulated
      receiving frequency and strength)). It needs be noted that each of
      the two brains would alternately be the sending and receiving
      brain, for purposes of familiarization of the data contents,
      initially towards the objective of creating the integrated brain
      system with one center of consciousness, then for Mary-I to
      transfer onto the other brain towards creating Mary-II-B (and both
      brains will have already previously agreed to this transfer so
      that transfer would typically not need to be consequent to a new
      decision after the creation of the integrated brain). For speedier
      and greater practical effectiveness,
      brain-physiologically-functionally meaningful ranges of signals
      detected in the “sending” brain should be modulated at
      meaningfully comparable strengths, frequencies and durations at
      the “receiving” brain at the latter's corresponding
      physiologically-functional reasonably equivalent micro locations,
      over electromagnetic waves at least at the “receiving” brain and
      preferably also detected as electromagnetic waves in the “sending”
      brain (since electromagnetic waves would enable optimizing (the
      process of) interbrain signal interactivity over a meaningfully
      variable range of modulated strengths, frequencies and relevant
      physiological locations at the “receiving” brain in the context of
      the counterparts of the “sending” brain). Extreme accuracy of
      physiological locations will not be important (only) at the
      commencement of communications, just reasonable micro-focus on
      output/input brain components, as signal attributes can
      subsequently be tuned from the feedback of the participating
      individuals as well as automatically directly from the neuronal
      responses at the receiving brain, and furthermore the brains would
      learn to recognize the signals and optimally adjust for the best
      sensing and interpretation of the signals. Operations research,
      numerical analysis and stochastic techniques, coupled with neural
      networks would optionally enable identifying the participant set
      specific fine tuned communication signal parameters, including,
      and of course not limited to, the component micro 3D coordinates
      internal to the corresponding brains. The logistical flexibility
      of using wireless electromagnetic waves at both the sending and
      receiving brains as elaborated in this section would enable the
      aforementioned computation premised search-and-find-for-optimality
      micro focus to be extended to if necessary the individual neurons,
      even to the level of the individual dendrite and axon (and allied)
      connections per neuron, but in the most part that would not be
      necessary because (a) there is sufficient neuronal redundancy of
      distribution of the same bit of information and (b) the equivalent
      location neuron counts across different brains would be
      substantially different so a super-micro-mapping would be
      inapplicable. The micro-focus process can even be expanded upon at
      the end (i.e. after appropriate focus maximization with
      electromagnetic devices) using atomic- and/or molecular particle
      based sensing devices, but that too would not be necessary in the
      most part. Search and find would essentially need to be targeted
      on the maximum feedback from participants and more importantly on
      the maximum automated neural responses at the receiving brain
      corresponding to the signal received from the output counterpart,
      at the sending brain, upon commencing the process at the
      approximate focused locations of known input/output counterparts,
      and honing in with the stated mathematically optimized techniques
      premised on the nature of non-optimized (only to reduce the search
      time—search without mathematical optimization would also work but
      would take longer, potentially infinitely longer in a few cases)
      searches until the maximal feedback from the participants and more
      importantly the maximal neuronal responses at the receiving brain
      is obtained that would indicate a successful link for that
      specific micro-component input output pair at the corresponding
      brains. Again, the data transfer needs preferably be in both
      directions (either simultaneously and/or alternately) so the
      sending brain receives real time feedback from the receiving brain
      and adjust suitably. Furthermore, and separately, and as indicated
      elsewhere in this Patent Application, from a brain learning and
      managing perspective, the data transfer needs preferably be in
      both directions (again either simultaneously and/or alternately).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As also indicated elsewhere in this Patent Application, as
      part of the connection process, the two linked brains are to be
      alternately (and sometimes jointly) rendered asleep or otherwise
      non-willed to allow each brain to learn to be aware of and
      function with the memory banks and consciousness components of the
      other brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] While electrodes could be useful for physiological zone
      counterpart mapping at the brains, they aren't necessary and are
      not recommended for this invention, because of the need to
      participant-specific-variably-micro-“search”-and-“find” optimized
      input/output brain coordinates, which would be best possible with
      micro coordinate focused electromagnetic signals—that can (unlike
      with electrodes) be easily refocused anywhere—of the relevant
      frequencies, strengths and durations. Hyper fine tuned (per the
      above techniques) parallel connections of the consciousness- and
      memory bank relevant corresponding components (supported by the
      pertinent functional/communications accessories of course) in the
      two brains would be an additional consideration. Focus should
      primarily be on the regular communications channels internal to
      the brain (i.e. generally excluding the external input path
      components, for speed) so that key input information is laid down
      in a way that the receiving brain deems optimal, rather than using
      attempted “forced” communications via channels not ordinarily used
      by the human brain which could result in the information not being
      stored properly.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] To the extent necessary, a chemical connection with
      neurotransmitters, as well as a direct, neuronal connection could
      and should also optionally be considered, as a catalyst to
      manifesting and optimizing inter-brain communication.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Although memory (and hence also the additional allied) data
      transfer is from a memory subcomponent buildup (i.e. bottom up)
      perspective (whereby the memory subcomponents are acquired with
      equal or more priority as/than are the higher memories that those
      subcomponents make), alternative consideration would be to allow
      the sending brain to consciously (and separately with altered,
      typically diminished, and at times raised levels of consciousness)
      “load” (i.e. become aware of to a degree of clarity that may be
      perceived by the (other) brain connected to this brain) relevant
      memories from its data bank that that brain deems relevant to the
      transfer and then enable only those memories to be transferred to
      the other brain. The advantage of this process would be that
      information would be relatively easily recognized by the receiving
      brain. The shortcoming would be that the process would be slow,
      often not include much of the memory (because of the sending
      brain's need to selectively load a memory first), and needs to be
      appropriately set up to not compromise or otherwise hinder
      creating the integrated, augmented, logical center of
      consciousness—i.e. the center of consciousness of the receiving
      brain must be suitably tuned to not simply consider the perceived
      (by it—the receiving brain) memory uploaded by (and at) the
      sending brain akin to just seeing new images and store that
      information (in it—the receiving brain) without, attempting to
      integrate with the sending brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Again, the key here for feasibility would be not to
      reinvent the wheel, but provide a supporting environment (that can
      be easily optimized per feedback from the two awake brains)
      conducive to enabling the brains' neurons to do what is natural to
      them—optimally integrate and communicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Any interbrain communication already patented, or otherwise
      not patentable, today is excluded from the scope of originality of
      this section, but such technologies are firmly denied the right to
      be applied to any aspect described as being within the scope of
      this Patent Application (Ref. “Fair scope of invention” and
      “Specific steps in invention”) without permission from this
      inventor.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Albeit already adequately clear above in this section
      appropriate additional technical elaborations on the above
      connection technologies may be provided with the non-Patent
      Application.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SPECIAL ADVANTAGES OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0090] This approach is in principle a guarantee to perpetual
      continuity of life, provided of course that a transfer is done
      prior to Mary-I's death. Even terminal physical ailments in Mary-I
      would not be impediments to that continuity, as long as Mary-I's
      brain is still reasonably functional. In fact even mental illness
      too would be naturally corrected as long as the transfer is done
      to a brain without mental illness.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] This invention pertains not to the speed of the process or
      emphasize on specific transfer mechanisms, but is the process
      itself. With time, as the transfer techniques speed up, the
      procedure can be applied for emergency circumstances when the
      Mary-I assesses a high likelihood of imminent death, for example
      when in an airplane that is about to crash, etc. In such
      scenarios, Mary-I would immediately wirelessly functionally
      integrate with the other brain located elsewhere outside the risk
      zone, rendering her brain and the new brain a single functional
      entity and “transfer” over.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The invention can subsequently be easily extended to
      primates or even animals of lower cognitive abilities.<br>

      PCT/IB2009/052355 filed with RO/IB on 3 Jun. 2009 (hereinafter

      <br>
      [0100] Not only would the invention enable human lifespan to be
      extended without limit for a healthy individual—it would in most

      disability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTIVE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0101] This section highlights, and explains the reasoned
      feasibility of, some of the deliberated core technology approaches
      towards practically achieving IBC towards the stated perpetual
      persistence of human life objectives of the cited invention. For
      the reader's maximum comprehension of the most significant core
      aspects of the aforesaid IBC technologies, technical terms and
      non-essential technical details have been largely excluded from
      this section.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Governing Premises of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0102] As indicated in the original patent application, the
      invention's key objective is for perpetual persistence of human
      life to happen neither by attempting in futile to perpetually
      extend the life of the human body (which will never succeed) nor
      by attempting to merely create a biological “clone” of the entire
      human body or of the memory contents, as even theoretically exact
      biological clones would still be mere copies of, and not, the
      original and therefore (clones) would have the critical
      shortcoming of NOT being able to allow the original human deem the
      clone as herself/himself (i.e. the biological clone will NOT have
      the same, but will instead have a mere copy of, the sense of “I”
      that the original human will have) notwithstanding that that
      original human and others around that clone would correctly
      identify the clone as an accurate copy of that individual;
      therefore the original human would remain as mortal as ever with
      the aforementioned futile attempts at human lifespan extension
      regardless of whether or not her/his biological clone is created.
      Instead the invention aims to enable perpetual persistence of
      human life by transferring the brain's “self identity” (i.e.
      “consciousness” of the self, inclusive of consciousness-,
      subconscious- and unconscious awareness components) and allied
      essential and non-essential memory data (with that “self identity”
      and memory data, et al together constituting the same, not merely
      a copy of the, sense of “I”) to another brain, and in time from
      that second brain to yet another brain and so on in perpetuity. As
      indicated above, the phrase “consciousness” of the self purports
      to include not just conscious awareness of the self, but self
      awareness at the sub- and unconscious levels as well. One of the
      fundamental inferences, and therefore one among the core
      proofs/justifications/validations and governing premises and key
      feasibility controls, of/in the invention, is that any
      individual's specific self identity—therefore the specific “sense
      of I” originally belonging to that individual—could never be
      merely copied to be “active” while the original self identity is
      already still active, but can in principle be only transferred to
      (i.e. be rendered “active” in) only one logical center of
      consciousness (e.g. in one brain (or equivalent)). Another of the
      fundamental inferences of/in, and one of the key feasibility
      controls and governing premises of, the invention is that such
      “self identity” data is never tied to any specific brain (or
      other) hardware—in other words any brain is no more than a
      provisional holding/containing environment for, and is not itself
      (and is not uniquely necessary to hold/contain), the self identity
      of the individual who has that brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Another fundamental governing premise and a key feasibility
      control is that the entire original contents of any human brain
      are not necessary to uniquely and adequately define (i.e. uniquely
      identify the external manifestations of the functioning of) that
      brain—and therefore on extension (uniquely identify) the human who
      has that brain. Therefore, the entirety of a brain's conscious-,
      subconscious- and unconscious memory data would not need to be
      transferred to the brain of another human for adequately
      “transferring” the self identify of the particular human who
      has/had that (first) brain. Explained simply, just as when a human
      loses a limb (or surgically adds new limb(s), or grows massive
      quantities of new cells across the body as anyway naturally
      happens to extremely significant extents to every healthy human
      across the lifetime of that human) the remainder (or the partly or
      fully upgraded augmented rendition) of the human still remains
      uniquely and reasonably adequately identifiable (both to that
      specific individual's own self and to others) as being no other
      than that same original individual and appropriately functioning
      with/or without added prosthetics, and similarly just as when
      portions of a human's brain are lost to TBI (traumatic brain
      injury) or to surgery (or massive quantities of new brain cells
      are added to the brain as naturally happens to very significant
      extents to every healthy human brain across the lifetime of that
      brain) the remainder (or the updated partly or fully augmented
      rendition) of that human brain can still remain uniquely and
      reasonably adequately identifiable (both to that specific
      individual's own self and to others) as belonging to (i.e.
      manifesting) that same original individual and appropriately
      functioning without the individual's losing self identity (except
      in rare situations when conscious self identity is lost when the
      brain is too damaged, yet even then aspects of the
      sub-/unconscious identity and other functions of that brain often
      still remain sub-/unconsciously identifiable to the self, and
      consciously to others) with or without corrective/other
      alterations to the brain, the quality of the success of self
      identity transfer, hence the degree of effective perpetual
      persistence of life—i.e. the quality of effective biological
      immortality—of that specific human, would essentially be a
      function of the extent of the memories, primarily those related to
      conscious cognition and secondarily also including those that are
      not (namely sub- and unconscious memory data), defining that human
      that are transferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] This premise is further justified by the fact that albeit
      every human's conscious and subconscious (and to relevant extents
      unconscious) memory contents are substantially different from the
      corresponding renditions 1 minute or 30 days or 1 year or
      10-/20-/50 years ago by way of considerable alterations—primarily
      additive, secondarily modifying and/or subtractive—to the
      conscious-, subconscious- and unconscious memory content, each of
      the varying renditions of that same human's overall memory content
      essentially fully retains her/his identifying (both to that
      specific individual's own self and to others) uniqueness and to
      appropriate extents her/his adequacy of functioning.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Restating the above further, even when a huge volume of new
      memory content is added, and in most cases when much of the memory
      content is modified or lost, the person is able to
      consciously/subconsciously/unconsciously recognize herself/himself
      as being the same original person, as too do others around that
      person.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] While the conscious aspects of memory (i.e. declarative
      memory (comprising of episodic and semantic memory)) would
      constitute the most prominent parameters uniquely defining any
      particular human's self identity, the sub- and unconscious memory
      components, learnt (i.e. procedural memory) and otherwise (i.e.
      genetically pre-existing sub-/unconscious “memories”, i.e.
      genetically pre-programmed neural attributes), not entirely or
      even at all related to conscious behavior, also contribute to
      uniquely defining that human's self identity—for example by way or
      the manner the human walks, laughs or otherwise interacts with
      society, other unique behavior or mannerisms of that individual,
      and even less significant, involuntary aspects as how that
      particular human breathes, etc. In other words, the identifying
      signature; of not just the brain's conscious and sub-/unconscious
      “memories” but even of the peripheral nervous system, including
      both its somatic and autonomic components—the latter's both
      parasympathetic and sympathetic categories—contribute to that
      human's self identity, although to a considerably lesser extent
      than the conscious memories. Therefore while IBC on conscious
      memory components would be the overwhelming core aspect of this
      invention, IBC on sub-/unconscious memories would also have a
      role, and to a very minor extent even IBC relevant to the
      peripheral nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] It is important to note that the objectives of the IBC
      would include both to “transfer” (as in copy) memory data as well
      as to “transfer” (as in move) self identity. See the four steps
      listed in the original patent application (Ref. section “Specific
      steps in invention” on pages 10-16 of that original patent
      application) body for details.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] For purposes of this invention, the areas of the brain that
      would be primarily, but not only, focused on towards enabling
      direct IBC with would be the memory and cognition sites in the
      telencephalon and diencephalon of the prosencephalon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Feasibility of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0109] The original patent application cited in this section lists
      a total of five (5) key bases of feasibility of the invention
      (Ref. section “Key feasibility controls” on pages 8-10 of that,
      patent application). Those details are not comprehensively
      reiterated in this section; some of them have been (e.g. in
      section “Governing premises of invention” of this section, and in
      this section).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The feasibility of IBC itself has been covered at length in
      this section.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Albeit, owing to the complexity of the core innovations
      constituting the invention, the latter's proof of feasibility
      cannot be comprehensively expressed in simple terms (the entirety,
      not mere portions, of the original patent application requires the
      reader's meticulous, competent comprehension towards her/his
      comprehensive technical understanding of why and how the invention
      is feasible inclusive, and because of, its innovations), surmised
      below is the proof of the invention's feasibility in stripped
      down, simple, non-comprehensive terms constituting another legal
      proof of the invention's feasibility without detailing on the
      innovation aspects of the invention (other than naturally
      reflecting the cogently compelling innovation quantum extant in
      the following core approach itself towards enabling perpetual
      persistence of human life):<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Brain neurons are already naturally highly versatile to
      essentially unlimited extents in terms of their ability to
      directly link up to (using newly generated intermediate neuronal
      pathways and/or existing neuronal pathways), and therefore
      communicate with, other already existing appropriate neurons in
      that brain, so there's no reason why, with the right, “reasonable”
      technology “aid” (i.e. with IBC), the neurons of one brain
      wouldn't naturally be able to directly link up and communicate
      with appropriate neurons of another brain. Such forms of neuronal
      communication are also already noted for example with transplanted
      organs/limbs.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Every healthy human brain naturally grows, at the
      appropriate time points in its lifetime (i.e. ranging from a very
      young age from before birth up to an elderly age), massive
      quantities of new neurons and integrate such neurons into that
      (regularly upgrading) brain causing almost every anatomical area
      of the brain to grow physically larger than it was before (as
      happens when the brain is still young) or (at least) be modified
      even when not physically larger (as happens both in young and
      older ages), allowing the original memory content and new memory
      content and (other) brain functions to continue to be
      appropriately integrated across that
      being-continually-physically-upgraded brain (with all earlier and
      newer memory data accessible as usual), and the brain still
      continues to have a single “logical” (as opposed to physical, as
      various physical locations in that brain are necessarily involved)
      center of consciousness—i.e. a well integrated single self
      identity continues to manifest (where the sub-components of self
      identity from the integrated memory data are all duly integrated,
      yet are still appropriately duly separately present for easy
      natural separate access willfully or otherwise). It is also
      scientifically well recognized that the extent and efficiency of
      the process of the overall memory encoding and retrieval and other
      capabilities of any brain can generally be substantially increased
      by deliberate natural effort/exercises in the brain. Therefore
      there's no reason why, with IBC and some deliberate natural
      effort/exercises in two brains, the same cannot happen with those
      two different brains—forming one integrated, single, “logical”
      brain (as opposed to one physical brain, since two physical brains
      are involved) with integrated memory data (i.e. combined memory
      data from the two brains, yet all memory data individually
      accessible post integration) and an integrated, single logical
      center of consciousness (and a well integrated single self
      identity formed of the two separate self identities (per the
      memory data) in the original two separate brains, yet those two
      separate component self-identities still appropriately duly
      separately present for easy natural separate access willfully or
      otherwise).<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Because of the typically considerable multi-redundancy of
      both data storage and functionality within any healthy human
      brain, including the ability of the human brain to adjust to new
      data and develop functions anew when necessary, the healthy human
      brain is reasonably capable of appropriately adequately
      functioning even when portions of any of its functional/anatomical
      areas are naturally discarded or even suitably removed surgically.
      Therefore there's no reason why the integrated, single, “logical”
      brain of the above paragraph cannot have the first physical brain
      physically removed from it (by terminating the IBC following the
      conclusion of the action surmised in the above paragraph) with no
      loss to the integrated memory data and the integrated single self
      identity in the second brain. As indicated in the above paragraph
      the integrated single self identity and integrated memory data
      will already include memory and self identity from the first brain
      (integrated with, yet accessible separate from, the second brain's
      original memory and self identity), per this invention's
      objective.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The memory data contents of any healthy brain are being
      constantly increased (and to a certain extent modified or lost)
      across the lifetime of the brain; yet there is no loss to self
      identity (even if normal multiple (i.e. varied flavors of)
      “personalities” are present, which is a very common normal
      phenomenon for most humans). Therefore there's no reason why the
      integrated memory data in the second brain post-IBC-termination of
      the above paragraph would in any way compromise the integrated
      single self identity (duly composed of the two separate original
      self identities, each individually accessible at the integrated
      will of that integrated single self identity). As indicated above
      in the earlier two paragraphs the integrated single self identity
      in the second brain will have self identity from the first brain
      along with the self identity that the second brain originally had.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Feasibility of Interbrain Communication (IBC)</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0116] The feasibility of IBC is analyzed in this section under
      two sub-sections, one on the specific areas of the brain to focus
      IBC on, and the other on the specific technology particulars to
      use for such IBC. Some readers might prefer to review the IBC
      technology subsection before reviewing the subsection on brain
      areas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Specific Areas of the Brain to Focus IBC On</b><br>
      <br>
      [0117] The essential approach in the invention is a 1:1
      component-mapped IBC simultaneously for all IBC-relevant
      components of count n in the two brains, where n&lt;N, N being the
      count of all (i.e. inclusive of non-IBC-relevant) corresponding
      components in each of two brains. Additional considerations are to
      simultaneously, spanning all n components, have grouped m:m, m:M
      or M:m IBC, where m&lt;M&lt;n&lt;N with the groups being
      functionally relevant, to allow greater efficiency yet ensuring
      that IBC data integrity would remain as good as in the 1:1
      architecture because any irrelevant input signal (from the other
      brain) received over IBC at any member subcomponent of any group
      of m or M components would be automatically recognized and
      discarded by the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The brain areas listed in this subsection include a
      majority, but not all, of the core areas to focus IBC on. Certain
      areas of the brain are mentioned more than once appropriate to
      their functional relevance to IBC. The areas are not listed in any
      particular sequence, other than by and large listing the IBC
      relevant components in the prosencephalon (constituted by the
      telencephalon and diencephalon, not necessarily covered in that
      order), mesencephalon and rhombencephalon in that order.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Before getting into IBC details per the above ordering it
      may be noted that the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus,
      precuneus and other areas of the prosencephalon play significant
      roles in declarative memory; hence those regions would be highly
      relevant to IBC. The basal ganglia and the cerebellum have roles
      in procedural memory and hence are IBC relevant, albeit not to the
      extent of the brain components associated with declarative memory.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The neocortex (neopallium), hippocampus and amygdala of the
      telencephalon and the thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus and
      epithalamus of the diencephalon are among brain areas to be
      importantly considered for IBC. The neopallium subcomponents
      frontal cortex (specifically including and necessarily not limited
      to its prefrontal cortex), parietal cortex, anterior cingulate and
      parts of another component of the telencephalon—the basal
      ganglia—would be of high IBC significance.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Sections of the limbic system, namely the thalamus
      (including but not limited to the centromedian nucleus), amygdala,
      hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, limbic cortex, anterior thalamic
      nuclei, mamillary body, fornicate gyrus (inclusive of, but not
      limited to, its cingulate gyrus and the inferior parahippocampal
      gyrus), fornix, dentate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, and its other
      constituents would be among IBC priorities. It might be noted that
      there is not a universally accepted defined set of constituents of
      the limbic system.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The amygdala, for its role in modulating memory
      particularly but not limited to in the context of emotions, would
      have its IBC priority in this order: cortical nucleus, central
      nucleus, medial nucleus, basolateral nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Dentate gyrae, deemed part of the hippocampal formation,
      would be IBC relevant because neurogenesis occurs here allowing
      the formation of new memories, for example for the possible
      distinction between multiple memories of similar incidents.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The thalamus forms thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits that
      are deemed critical to consciousness, and its role towards
      appropriate inter-brain memory data interchange with IBC towards
      individuality manifestation for perpetual persistence of human
      life would be vital. Among the most pertinent areas of the
      thalamus would be the centromedian nucleus (part of the
      intralaminar nucleus), also known as the centrum medianum
      (Cm-Pf/CM). The CM is known to have both excitatory (e.g. over
      acetylcholine) and inhibitory (e.g. over Gamma-Aminobutyric acid
      (GABA)) effect on the, corpus striatum. The medial dorsal nucleus
      is part of the thalamus and is connected to the limbic system and
      to the prefrontal cortex, and it has key roles in memory, abstract
      cognition, planning et al and will be part of IBC considerations.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The hippocampus is among the most important components
      relevant to memory formation, and would be a key IBC factor. It is
      believed that with the passage of time long term memories are
      formed outside the hippocampus. The key circuitry for the
      hippocampus involves receiving input from the relatively
      superficial layers (EC2, EC3) of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and
      sending output to the deeper layers of the EC. The cornus ammonis
      3 (CA3) area of the hippocampus receives input from EC2 as well as
      from the dentate gyrus (DG, deemed part of the hippocampal
      formation as indicated previously in this section), while the
      cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) receives input from EC3 as well as from
      cornus ammonis 3 (CA3) (through the fibers of the “Schaffer
      collaterals”). The perforant pathway connects the entorhinal
      cortex to all the CA components of the hippocampus, as well as to
      both the subiculum and the dentate gyrus areas of the hippocampus.
      CA1 also receives input from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus.
      Output from the CA1 goes to the deeper layers of the EC, either
      directly or via the subiculum (which is part of the hippocampus).
      This is represented in the circuit diagram in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] It is deemed that areas of the neopallium (a.k.a.
      neocortex/cerebral cortex/isocortex) and the hippocampus
      synchronize information and functioning in the theta frequency for
      various cognitive operations, including but not limited to for
      working memory activities.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Therefore the theta frequency would be an IBC
      synchronization basis for those components across the two brains.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] As has been mentioned in greater detail in the IBC
      technology section of this section, this invention deems it
      meaningful to tap directly into the signals at inter-hemispheric
      neuronal pathways for IBC towards easier access into the
      respective hemispheres. Important among such IBC relevant
      inter-hemispheric neuronal connections are the corpus callosum,
      the anterior commissure and the hippocampal commissure (also known
      as the commissure of fornix).<br>
      <br>
      [0129] The parahippocampal gyrus surrounds the hippocampus and is
      one among gyri that are part of the temporal lobe of the cerebral
      cortex (neopallium), and it is relevant to encoding and retrieving
      memory, hence pertinent to IBC. The parahippocampal cortex is a
      specific area combining the (medial) fusiform face area (FFA) and
      part of the (posterior) parahippocampal gyrus. The FFA complements
      the function of the PPA (which is part of the parahippocampal
      gyrus) in that the former is functional in the context of
      recognizing faces, while the latter is functional for scene
      recognition.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] As with the entire above portion of this subsection, unless
      otherwise mentioned, all the components listed below in the
      remainder of this subsection would play a role in IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Included in the (anterior) parahippocampal gyrus are both
      the entorhinal and perihinal cortices, both of which merit IBC.
      Forming the primary input to the hippocampus the entorhinal cortex
      (EC) (Brodmann areas 28 and 34) preprocesses the signals input to
      the hippocampus (for familiarity/recognition). Data connection
      with the EC is with the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, the
      perihineal cortex, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The fornix of brain is a route for signals to the septal
      nuclei and mammillary bodies from the hippocampus, and deemed to
      be relevant to memory, hence is compatible to IBC considerations.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] The mammillary bodies are material to IBC in that, among
      other functions, they route signals to the thalamus (via the
      mammillo-thalamic tract) from the hippocampus and amygdala, and
      are believed to have a role in recognition memory and smell
      memory.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The Papez circuit (FIG. 4)—a key circuit of the limbic
      system deemed significant to long term declarative memory encoding
      and (deemed by some) to control emotion—surmises some of the
      overall key connections of relevance to encoding memory, and hence
      its components are IBC pertinent.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The orbitofrontal cortex consists of Brodmann areas 11, 47
      and 10 in humans, and is involved in decision making. It merits
      IBC considerations.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The medial temporal lobe (MTL) overall is thought to be
      associated with declarative memory, awareness and learning and
      would be relevant to IBC. Old memories are distinguished from new
      by the MTL regardless of consciousness state. Along the same
      lines, learning is facilitated by the MTL regardless of conscious
      awareness.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The basal ganglia is (are) highly germane to IBC, including
      but not limited to in the context of procedural memory. It is part
      of the telencephalon and is primarily comprised of the subthalamic
      nucleus, paleostriatum (a.k.a. globus pallidum), striatum (a.k.a.
      striate nucleus) and the substantia nigra. The caudate nucleus,
      which is part of the striatum, has learning and memory function.
      The putamen, which too is part of the striatum, has a role in
      various forms of learning, in particular but not limited to
      category learning, and although the exact functional
      specialization of the putamen is unknown the fact that it is
      connected to key brain areas and therefore and otherwise is deemed
      important to learning renders it notably IBC relevant to the
      project. The subthalamic nuclei, which are part of the basal
      ganglia, will also be specifically considered for IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The primary motor cortex, which is part of the frontal lobe
      of the cerebral cortex, works along with the pre-motor cortex
      (Brodmann area 6) towards planning and making decisions. The
      supplementary motor cortex is relevant to memory and learning. The
      primary-, pre- and supplementary motor cortices will all be part
      of the IBC scope because the motor skills that they relate to
      would constitute part of the self identity signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The superior frontal gyrus—a major component of the
      cerebral cortex and an important IBC focus—has a key role in self
      awareness. Importantly, the inferior frontal gyrus is associated
      with verbal skills (Brodmann areas 44 and 45 constitute Broca's
      area for syntactic/semantic and phonological processing) and on
      selective decision making, hence it has IBC relevance vis-à-vis
      speech and decision signatures. While the superior- and inferior
      frontal gyri would be relatively important IBC candidates of the
      project, the middle frontal gyrus would be less so. The fusiform
      gyrus, by use of its FFA (Fusiform Face Area), would be a notable
      IBC candidate, for the reason of its playing an important role in
      recognizing faces and other objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Several among Brodmann areas associated with the temporal
      lobe would be appropriately assessed for IBC considerations. For
      example, BA20 (deemed to be associated with recognition memory),
      BA34 (also part of the entorhinal area), etc are relevant in that
      context.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The precuneus of the parietal lobe would have IBC relevance
      on account of its role in episodic memory, consciousness and
      self-awareness.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] Among the other areas of the parietal lobe, the primary
      somatosensory cortex (S1, comprised of BA3-1) and the posterior
      parietal cortex would be low-to-moderately meaningful candidates
      for IBC on account of the individual identifying signatures they
      enable in the context of processing sensory and allied stimuli.
      The former is significant vis-à-vis sensing touch and other
      stimuli, and the latter enables planning by appropriately
      integrating motor and sensory functions. The postcentral gyms of
      the parietal lobe has functions that have some similarity to those
      of the posterior parietal gyrus, and would be a moderate IBC
      candidate for the project.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The insular cortex has several significant roles, including
      awareness of the body's internals, awareness of the self and
      control of emotions, control of motor functions, etc. and it would
      be an IBC candidate.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The cingulate cortex would be of IBC relevance, and
      appropriate of its segments—subgenual area 25 (BA25) (plays a role
      in the hippocampus pertinent to memory), anterior cingulate
      (essential to working memory), retrosplenial cortex (RSC)
      (relevant to memory)—would be given due IBC consideration. Both
      the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the retrosplenial cortex
      are critical to spatial navigation, with the former focusing more
      on spatially interpreting the immediate local visual data while
      the latter on placing that data in the overall spatial context.
      The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) effects cognition,
      while the ventral ACC is pertinent to emotion—so while both would
      be IBC candidates the former would be relatively more significant.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Brodmann areas 41, 42 and 22p (essentially comprising the
      primary auditory cortex and Wernicke's area) of the superior
      temporal gyrus would be IBC considered. The inferior- and middle
      temporal gyri would be relevant to some extent in as much as their
      visual processing (i.e. visual memory) signatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The mesocortical-, mesolimbic- and nigrostriatal dopamine
      pathways would be IBC contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) of the basal forebrain
      is deemed relevant to attention, and hence would be material to
      IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The temporal neocortex would be looked at for IBC, being
      where long term memory of the initial temporary memory is formed
      at the hippocampus.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] The mesencephalon (mid brain)'s tectum has functions
      related to auditory (inferior colliculus of the tectum) and visual
      information processing (superior colliculus of the tectum),
      allowing it to carry information processing signatures (as
      different individuals would uniquely differently process the same
      visual/auditory information) that would uniquely identify a
      specific individual, rendering the mesencephalon moderately
      relevant to IBC. Much of the mesencephalon other than the tectum
      is the cerebral peduncle, which is often defined as being
      inclusive of the midbrain pretectum, tegmentum, and the crus
      cerebri.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The metencephalon and myelencephalon—of the
      rhombencephalon—would not be a priority for IBC but they would not
      be entirely excluded, because the sub- and un-conscious memory
      signatures they carry are unique to identifying specific humans.
      Of these two, the pons and cerebellum in the metencephalon have
      reasonable IBC relevance. Listed below are some of the functional
      areas where such signatures exist. The pons routes certain sensory
      data between the cerebellum and the cerebrum, and the pontine
      tegmentum of the pons has a role in REM sleep (and therefore in
      consciousness). The density of
      P-(ponto-geniculate-occipital)-waves in the pontine tegmentum
      increases following memory training activity, hence the inference
      that the P-waves are, and hence the pons is, relevant to learning.
      The parabrachial nucleus (PbN) has a role in taste sensation,
      including for signals received from the nucleus of the solitary
      tract (NTS). The pons also has a role in the synchrony between
      respiration and cardiac activity characteristics, thereby
      indirectly constituting one among brain centers associated with
      involuntary identifying signatures pertinent to IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The cerebellum carries memory signatures by virtue of its
      important role in procedural memory, hence is relevant to IBC, in
      that it, among others, contributes to motor control with
      perception of sensory data, by enabling a coordinated integration
      of data exchange between the motor cortex of the cerebrum and
      spinocerebellar tract. The cerebellum in particular the
      neocerebellum—also has cognitive functions including but not
      limited to attention, of some IBC pertinence.<br>

      <b>IBC Technology</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> [0152] i. Core Approach</b><br>
      <br>
      [0153] For purposes of IBC quality and efficiency, every effort
      would be taken to refrain from reinventing “the wheel” from ground
      up, but rather by letting the brains maximally naturally
      communicate and acquire data content by themselves from each other
      in a signaling technology environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] IBC would be an optimized functional and physical (i.e.
      anatomical) integrative process. In other words, IBC will be
      undertaken based primarily on anatomically equivalent locations of
      the two brains, the selection of which (locations) would be
      suitably optimized or modified based on functional equivalence, as
      precise functional equivalence might not always be identifiable by
      only anatomical or only functional equivalence alone. Towards that
      integrative process, to identify the approximate functionally
      equivalent locations, the two brains would be subject to a very
      wide range of categories of external stimuli (e.g. static and
      video images, language- and non-language audio and video (examples
      of language related video would be written text, video of people
      speaking, visually symbolic language), simple through complex
      logic processing scenarios that would evoke both
      regular-data-memory and logical-ability-(i.e. unique logic
      signature)-memory, olfactory input, tactile input (including but
      not limited to when combined with language), other memory evoking
      and allied memory relevant external input, etc) and internal
      stimuli (i.e. primarily electrical and electromagnetic (and
      optionally biochemical) stimuli applied internally directly into
      locations of anatomical relevance (including but not limited to
      information already publicly known on elaborate input/output sites
      of various neuronal circuits in the human brain) coupled with the
      aforementioned earlier-stage location conclusions consequent to
      the external stimuli) and the corresponding integrated locations
      and the respective brainwave frequencies would be noted. Those
      integrated locations in the two brains would then be identified
      with increasing accuracy in several stages by iterating the above
      process multiple times. Then IBC would be established between the
      two brains at those locations at (or otherwise
      compatible/synchronized to) the appropriate wave frequencies
      (including but not limited to in synchronized theta (4-7 Hz) and
      alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency ranges, given that those frequencies are
      deemed highly relevant to memory encoding and retrieval),
      strengths and durations—including but not limited to as a variable
      sequence of “signal bursts” of electromagnetic and/or electrical
      signals, while noting that IBC would (also) be appropriately
      directed to the respective input/output neural circuit areas—i.e.
      the output of a component of one brain fed to the input of the
      equivalent component in the other brain (instead of and/or in
      parallel addition to naturally feeding that output to the
      equivalent component in the same brain itself as well) and vice
      versa. The beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (&gt;30 Hz) frequencies would
      also be used for IBC, both when those are the base frequencies of
      the corresponding brainwaves at those locations as well as
      otherwise for augmenting IBC efficiency and quality. The
      categories of synchronizing the IBC signal with the brains that
      would be considered would be in-phase synchronization where there
      would he no phase shift and the frequencies match, out-of-phase
      synchronization where there would be a phase shift that could be
      greater than zero and less than half of the phase, anti-phase
      synchronization where the frequencies would be the same but there
      would be a half-phase shift, only-frequency-synchronization where
      the phases could be anything but the frequencies match, partial
      synchronization where in a large group of neurons some (typically
      the majority) would operate in synchrony but the rest wouldn't and
      the whole group would still maintain the overall synchrony,
      coincidental synchronization where there would be no uniform
      frequency or phase but nevertheless the probability would remain
      high that specific events (e.g. overall group of maximum or
      minimum spikes, etc) of the operations would match the
      corresponding events of the other, virtual modulated
      synchronization where the frequencies would be in integral
      multiples and therefore in a virtual phase. The reason for the
      need to consider all the above frequencies and phases is that two
      brains will not necessarily operate in the exact same frequencies
      and phases even at the earlier mentioned considerably precisely
      identified functionally equivalent sites: hence optimal
      frequency-phase-intensity-duration combination(s) corresponding to
      various functionally equivalent sites across the two brains would
      need to be identified specific to those two brains.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] As mentioned above, external stimulus alone would not be
      adequate to evoking a sufficiently large domain of memory. The
      reason for that is that large chunks of memory would not have been
      originally created based on external stimulus alone, because much
      of such memory would have been formed consequent to logically
      variably internally processing (often involving a huge array and
      layers of internal logical processing and memory accesses)
      complex-external-input with already existing internal conscious-,
      subconscious- and unconscious memory data, hence such memory
      couldn't ordinarily be invoked by external input alone. Another
      reason for the need for direct internally applied memory retrieval
      triggers is that even for memories that have been formed primarily
      (Note: ordinarily it cannot be only) based on external input alone
      it would not be always practicable to select, all possible
      relevant combinations of external input as memory retrieval
      triggers to retrieve those memories, simply because such external
      input combination possibilities are too huge and too varied for
      different people. Accordingly, some of the memory would need to be
      accessed by direct internal stimulus to (i.e. internal signaling
      at—typically but not always necessarily electrical or
      electromagnetic) specific functional locations in the brain
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] The synchrony in the partial and coincidental
      synchronization categories, among others, would be determined
      specifics of with appropriate numerical analysis, Fourier
      transform, and other processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Neuronal synchronization between the two brains would be
      across a massive count of neurons in each at the same time, over
      artificial chemical and/or electrical “synapses” located between
      each end of the virtual electromagnetic and/or electrical (and/or
      chemical) communications (for IBC) channel and the group of
      neurons at the two brains. All that would essentially be
      necessary, with relative technical ease, is to electrically detect
      the real (i.e. neuronal) action potential at the final (group of)
      neuron(s) in the pre-synaptic end(s) in one brain at the point it
      is connected to one (outbound) end of the IBC channel and transmit
      that electrical voltage—not at all necessarily at the
      neuron-typical +70 mV but at an appropriate (other) voltage—signal
      to the artificial synapse(s) at the other (inbound) end of the IBC
      channel connecting the other brain, which would result in the
      artificial synapse(s) at that inbound end of the IBC channel
      releasing the appropriate neurotransmitters (for an artificial
      chemical synapse) causing the triggering of, or simply
      electrically (for an artificial electrical synapse) directly
      triggering, an action potential in the first (group of) neuron(s)
      connected to the IBC channel at that receiving end, which should
      result in the natural chemical and/or electrical synaptic
      communication down the IBC link from one brain to the other, and
      back in a similar process.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] These artificial synapses would be created to function at
      the appropriate oscillation frequencies pertinent to the
      categories of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons in the IBC link.
      Artificial synapses would be complimented by appropriate natural
      synapses that would (naturally) develop during IBC. It is to be
      noted that in the context of IBC these natural synapses are those
      that newly develop between neurons at either of the two brains to
      facilitate IBC per the brains' natural tendency to transfer,
      receive and assimilate information. While largely, other than the
      artificial and natural long-/short term synapses, the remainder of
      the two brains at the two ends would not need to be
      physiologically modified too much, some IBC effectiveness- and
      efficiency enhancing techniques, in part listed below in the
      remainder of this section, would be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] The corpus callosum is deemed in this invention an optional
      and/or complementing location for IBC connections. The reason for
      that is that because the corpus callosum already appropriately
      reaches into the depths of the two hemispheres of each brain,
      accessing those hemispherical depths would be appropriately
      relatively easier by directly accessing the corpus callosum
      itself. The specific connection points on the corpus callosum to
      enable IBC at would be identified in a mechanism using external
      and internal input to the two brains and determining which
      neuronal areas of the corpus callosum activate and integrating
      that information and the corpus callosum's already known
      anatomical (including circuitry) information with the
      corresponding activation and anatomical information for the
      remainder of the brain. That overall mechanism would be similar to
      that for identifying IBC connection points in the remainder of the
      brain as described in this section.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] The anterior commissure which links the two cerebral
      hemispheres, albeit to an overall extent considerably lower than
      that for the corpus callosum, would be another area to focus IBC
      at, with proceedings as with the corpus callosum. Focus on the
      anterior commissure would be primarily, but not limited to, in the
      context of the temporal lobes and the amygdala pair, with those
      being among the primary brain components relevant to IBC that they
      connect across the two hemispheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] In a manner similar to that for the corpus callosum and the
      anterior commissure, the hippocampal commissure (a.k.a. commissure
      of fornix) is important in as much as the hippocampus, because it
      in effect connects the hippocampus across the two hemispheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] For IBC between equivalent components in the two brains it
      would not be necessary for those equivalent corresponding
      components to be linked in entirety or even to a highly major
      extent. When the entirety of two equivalent components in the two
      brains are not directly linked, the communication bandwidth
      available to the aforementioned directly linked subset of
      components would be used by the entirety of those equivalent
      components to communicate with, wherein data in the non-linked
      portions of the equivalent components of the brains would pass
      through the linked portions. In fact extreme accuracy in
      identifying IBC-relevant equivalent components/locations in the
      brains would not be necessary—reasonable accuracy would
      suffice—the equivalent components of each brain would know to
      filter in and filter out relevant and irrelevant signals from the
      corresponding equivalent and non-equivalent sections respectively
      of the other brain towards IBC. In fact irrelevant signals
      exchanged between even equivalent components across the brains
      would be similarly naturally discarded. However, the efficiency
      and to a certain extent the integrity (i.e. inclusive of quality)
      of information transferred (i.e. the extent to which relevant data
      is not excluded from transfer, and corruption is minimized of pre-
      and/or post-transferred data) over IBC would be increased with
      greater accuracy in connecting equivalent locations. A
      communicating “band” of reasonably high bandwidth, typically using
      an appropriately large count of virtual synapses, between
      reasonably equivalent brain components should be sufficient for
      IBC. Data would be exchanged across those bands between the
      equivalent areas of the two brains, somewhat akin to, but less
      extensively than, how the corpus callosum assists the two
      hemispheres of a brain to communicate. Just as any healthy brain
      continually naturally learns how to optimally use the corpus
      callosum depending on the content and other circumstances of the
      inter-hemispheric data transfer, the two brains linked for IBC
      would also naturally learn—with the appropriate technology
      assistance in the directions outlined in this section and in the
      original patent application—how to optimize the use of that IBC
      channel. In other words, IBC would happen, albeit inefficiently
      arid inadequately, towards the invention's objective of perpetual
      persistence of human Life, even with a relatively rudimentary IBC
      communications channel. Yet the more advanced the IBC mechanism
      per the directions outlined in this section and in the original
      patent application, the more efficient and adequate IBC would be
      towards the invention's objective of perpetual persistence of
      human life. The novelty/tangibility/etc—hence the patentability—of
      the invention is not only in the technology of the IBC mechanism
      towards that objective, but also significantly in the very fact
      that perpetual persistence of human life can at all be plausibly
      feasibly attained with IBC regardless of howsoever rudimentary
      (i.e. nevertheless always constituting the invention's use of the
      technology “tool” IBC) or sophisticated that IBC mechanism is.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Illustratively expanding with an example on the point of
      patent law on the logic of patentability of any invention, an
      ordinary nail in itself is not novel/tangible/etc as an
      invention—hence not patentable—any longer, but even if that
      ordinary nail with nothing else could be innovatively used for any
      purpose that newly achieves an extraordinarily significant,
      meaningful human objective even if a significant quantity of
      natural human biology constitutes a major proportion
      (hypothetically, even if as high as or higher than 99.99% as long
      as that proportion is less than 100%) of the overall technology
      process of attaining that objective, the use of that simple nail
      to at all enable that objective would constitute a patentable
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Various categories of event related potential (ERP)—namely
      potentials measured in the brains consequent to perception,
      cognition et al (as part of the earlier discussed overall process
      of external and internal input towards determining equivalent
      locations in the two brains for IBC)—would be used to identify the
      IBC relevant functionally equivalent locations in the two brains.
      Such ERPs would include, but wouldn't be limited to, N100, N400,
      P300 (P3), SPS (P600), ELAN (early left anterior negativity), late
      positive potential (LPP), etc. LPP is deemed relevant in the
      context of managing emotions, and is therefore deemed pertinent in
      the emotional memory signature transfer context of IBC. ERP P200
      (P2) is deemed significant to the process of intent, and therefore
      and otherwise in memory. N270, N430 are deemed pertinent to
      conflict identification and processing. P3a and P3b are
      cognitively important in that while the former is associated with
      setting attention to something of adequate newness the latter
      occurs when unlikely events related to the task already being
      processed occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Since EEGs contain information from several ERPs and other
      signals that are superimposed, thereby muffling the independent
      ERPs, it would be necessary to suitably process the EEGs with
      Independent Component Analysis (ICA), (Multi-way/Kernel) Principal
      Component Analysis (PCA) (including the Karhunen-Loève theorem
      rendition). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARFAC) a.k.a. Canonical
      Decomposition, Tucker Decomposition, Adomain Decomposition Method
      (ADM) for solving partial and ordinary non-linear differential
      equations using non-numerical techniques. Domain Decomposition
      Methods (DDM), Cholesky Decomposition, Largest Lyapunov Exponent
      (LLE), Hurst Exponent, Higher Order Spectra (HOS), et al.<br>

      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0166] Signal enhancing techniques need be suitably applied to
      render IBC faster and more adequate. Techniques surmised below
      would be among those that would be considered towards that
      objective.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Embryonic and adult stem cells as well as progenitor cells
      enabling the growth of new neurons would enhance IBC connectivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] The CREB (cAMP response element binding) protein, deemed
      relevant in the formation of long term memories, would be assessed
      for optimized use at both the sending and receiving brains in the
      project. The memory augmenting effect of pregnenolone sulfate
      injected into the limbic system would be a factor considered
      towards expediting IBC. The memory consolidation effect of
      down-regulating NR3A NMDAR(NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor)s
      would be assessed, in particular, but not limited to, because it
      is understood that NR3A—a type of NMDAR—causes resistance to the
      formation of long term memories by way of reducing synaptic
      plasticity, (reducing) synaptic counts and (reducing) synaptic
      densities. PolyADP-ribosylation would be looked at in terms of
      maximizing long term memory formation. The interaction between
      NMDA receptors and D1 receptors would also be studied in the
      context of long term memory formation. Also would be assessed the
      effect (on long term memory) of the induction of AMPA receptors
      into synapses. Further assessment would be on the relevance (to
      working memory) of hippocampus dependent, configuration-relational
      (CR) synchrony in the thereabouts of the theta frequency across
      the temporal and occipital lobes and non-CR
      (non-hippocampal-dependent) maintenance across the parietal and
      frontal lobes, and the effect that alpha oscillations have on LTP.
      The effect of dopamine on LTP would also be considered. The effect
      of CAM kinase II on hippocampal LTP would be assessed. It is
      deemed that theta rhythms and interactions between theta and alpha
      rhythms are critical to encoding and recalling memory. Therefore
      substantial focus would be on theta and alpha synchronization for
      optimized IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] The significance of the MEF2C (MADS box transcription
      enhancer factor 2, polypeptide C a.k.a. Myocyte-specific enhancer
      factor 2C) protein to learning in the context of IBC would be
      investigated. In particular, the deemed reduction of memory (and
      therefore learning) abilities in specific areas of the brain,
      including but not limited to the hippocampus, (despite a possible
      consequent) associated increase in the synaptic densities, by
      under-expressing (i.e. reducing) MEF2C would be looked into.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] Dendritic spines are deemed to be extremely significant to
      memory. In part because they're based on actin, they are highly
      plastic—i.e. they change their shape and size (and count) quickly,
      in particular the former (i.e. shape) which can change in seconds.
      The key types of receptors that dendritic spines express are
      receptors for glutamate and receptors for BDNF (Brain-derived
      Neurotrophic Factor). Examples of glutamate receptors are NMDAR,
      AMPAR, etc. Dendritic spines are deemed to be highly significant
      to cognition and short term memory as well, not just long term
      memory. Accordingly, a brain's ability to communicate effectively
      and fast would be directly dependent on the efficacy of its use of
      dendritic spines. The efficiency (i.e. speed) and extent of IBC
      would be significantly a function of the optimal production and
      use of dendritic spines in both brains (Note: not necessarily only
      the use of existing dendritic spines, but the use of dendritic
      spines specifically created to enable IBC be more efficient and
      effective).<br>
      <br>
      [0171] The role of specific neuropeptides towards augmented
      neuronal interconnectivity would be analyzed, including but not
      limited to<br>
      <br>
      Galanin: Of the three receptor classes GALR1, GALR2 and GALR3 (all
      of the G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) class), significant would
      be GALR3 which is deemed relevant to memory and cognition. Galanin
      coexists with the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.<br>
      Neuropeptide Y: This neuropeptide coexists with the
      neurotransmitter norepinephrine (noradrenalin), GABA, epinephrine
      (adrenalin), and it is deemed to play a role in memory.<br>
      Substance P: This coexists with the neurotransmitters
      acetylcholine and serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine). It is
      specifically associated with pain reception. Artificially induced
      pain, at various locations, to various degrees and for varying
      durations, would be considered as an IBC enhancing factor for this
      project.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] As indicated earlier in this section, the optimal
      production and use of dendritic spines would be critical to
      optimal IBC, so that huge volumes of memory (and related) data are
      transferred fast and without compromising the integrity of that
      data. Of high relevance in this context are the spine apparatus
      (endoplasmic reticulum) found inside some dendritic spines and the
      synaptopodin protein that constitutes an important part of the
      spinal apparatus. The factors that affect the
      morphology/morphogenesis of dendritic spines would be suitably
      used towards the production and use of dendritic spines for IBC.
      Such factors include, but aren't limited to, receptors, proteins
      for scaffolding, cytoplasmic kinases, enzymes, special proteins
      and chemicals, and electrical, magnetic and other stimulants, et
      al. For example, in addition to the AMPA receptor, NMDA receptor
      etc the SIGMA1 receptor (present at the endoplasmic reticulum)
      that encodes calcium signaling is deemed to be relevant to
      dendritic spine creation; enzymes, amino acids and tumor
      suppressor proteins like Scribble modulates the expression of
      dendritic spines; melatonin affects spine density; the GluN class
      (including but not necessarily limited to the GluN2B class) of
      NMDA receptors are deemed to be highly relevant to affecting
      dendritic spines in the hippocampus and cortex and thereby affect
      learning—optimally increasing GluN2B for example could augment IBC
      efficiency; protein kinase (a.k.a. phosphotransferase, which are
      enzyme(s) that function to transfer phosphate group(s)) that rely
      on Calmodulin (calcium binding protein) are also deemed important
      for dendritic spines in the context learning and therefore to IBC;
      etc. The effect of three of four classes of the oligopeptide
      angiotensin—namely classes II, III and IV—would be looked into in
      as much as enhancing adequate growth of dendritic spines and
      therefore of the efficacy of IBC. The extent to which the ABI
      family of genes is able to affect actin polymerization and
      therefore (its receptors) affect dendritic spine formation would
      be a consideration in the project. Estrogen would be looked into
      in as much as its ability to optimize the morphology of dendritic
      spines, and therefore its use in IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] The molecular mechanism of storing memory would be
      appropriately IBC relevant. An overall mechanism of interest is
      the strengthening of synapses by creating proteins of the likes of
      Lypla, Cam Kinase, et al. The creation of those proteins happens
      by the relevant RNA that is otherwise blocked (from creating those
      proteins) with wrapping proteins, which are degenerated or broken
      down when new signals arrive freeing up the RNA to create the
      strengthening proteins. The use of this and allied mechanisms
      would improve IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] The absence of the chloride channel CIC-2 in nerve cells
      has been found to make them more excitable, hence in principle
      more capable of either transmitting or inhibiting information (the
      latter when such neurons are “inhibitory”), rendering that a
      possible means of controlling IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] The extent of glutamate released and reabsorbed (post
      signaling) would be a factor to be considered on how effectively
      neurons communicate with each other in the IBC context.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Advanced non-rigid ultra-thin electrodes in the 100 to 500
      micrometer thickness range that are better able to mould to the
      human brain and transmit information much better than common rigid
      electrodes have already been developed, and these would if
      necessary assist in IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] Special DNA segments, called “enhancer regions”, are known
      to cause the release of specific RNA called “enhancer RNA” (eRNA)
      to release proteins that would augment the creation of synapses
      across neurons post stimulation, thereby enabling learning, making
      this of relevance to enhancing IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] The significance of “mirror neurons” that fire both when a
      human performs a task and the human watches another human perform
      a task, would be considered in the IBC context. The limbic
      striatum has been determined to be significant to implicit
      learning, and hence would be given due focus vis-à-vis IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] The effects of the hunger hormone ghrelin, produced in the
      stomach and pancreas, on memory and learning (by influencing the
      hippocampus) is of some relevance to IBC. Ghrelin is known to
      augment dendritic spine formation in the hippocampus and (thereby
      and/or otherwise) affect long term potentiation (LTP). IBC
      learning could be expedited and rendered more effective with the
      optimal administration of ghrelin.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The effect of neuron-to-glial-cell communication is
      pertinent, and would be specifically analyzed, in the context of
      enhancing neuron-to-neuron communication from the IBC perspective.
      The mechanisms of such neuron-to-glial-cell communication would
      include but not be limited to the neuron's synaptic and
      non-synaptic releases of specialized signaling chemicals, as well
      as other chemicals (e.g. neurotransmitters, ions, etc released
      into the glia) that ultimately boost neuron-to-neuron
      communication. Of particular interest would include, but not be
      limited to, the use of the calcium ions in the 3-way communication
      between glial cells and post- and pre-synaptic neurons. The glial
      cells of the greatest significance in this context are the
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of the CNS. Astrocytes are known
      to be able to regulate synaptic plasticity, not only as small
      groups on a single synapse but as larger communicating groups of
      astrocytes that combined affect a network of neurons. Astrocytes
      are known to be able to generate Ca&lt;2+&gt; signaling in
      response to neuronal activation, and its activity can be mediated
      by suitable agonists and antagonists, among others, thereby
      enabling an element of synaptic transmission control for use in
      IBC. Of secondary significance would be the ependymal cells and
      radial glia of the CNS. Schwann cells of the PNS, and to some
      extent even the role of microglia would be of some significance.
      Of added pertinence would be the role of P2X- and P2Y
      purinoceptors in the communication between glial and neuron cells
      using nucleotides, where gliotransmitter ATP plays a role. In
      addition, of interest would be determining if ephrin ligands and
      eph receptors could be optimally utilized towards neuron-glia
      communication, for enhancing IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and/or allied
      technologies would be considered for IBC towards live observation
      of chemical synapse operation where necessary.<br>

      (PCDHGA11), Protocadherin gamma-B7 (PCDHGB7), Protocadherin
      gamma-A12 (PCDHGA12), Protocadherin beta-13 (PCDHB13).

      would be investigated for relevance to neuron-to-neuron
      communication for IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] The effect of L-serine and other amino acids on aspects of
      neuronal growth, hence neuronal communication, would be IBC
      pertinent.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] The use of light sensitive ion channels called
      Channelrhodopsins (Chr) towards selectively switching off areas of
      the brain as part of discerning activation for data transmission
      would be looked into in the IBC context. ChR2 could be among the
      more promising in that context, with the other options being ChR1
      and VChR1—all of them being sensitive to the cations K&lt;+&gt;,
      Na&lt;+&gt;, H&lt;+ and Ca&gt;&lt;++&gt;. Similarly haldosporin
      (NpHR) is a light sensitive ion channel that is sensitive to only
      anion (i.e. negative) chloride ions. ChR2 is sensitive to blue
      light (maximum absorption at wavelength 480 nm), while VChR1 is
      sensitive to yellow and could potentially trigger neurons around
      580 nm. The use of the Arch and Mac genes, to switch off neurons
      when exposed to yellow and blue lights respectively, is another
      effective option, whereby those genes could be loaded onto viruses
      and inserted into neurons without affecting their operations, and
      when those neurons are exposed to blue or yellow light energy
      producing proteins in the cells are inhibited, resulting in the
      overall temporary deactivation of the neuron, constituting an IBC
      managing mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      The Reversibility and Multi-Candidature Capabilities of Self
      Identity Transfer<br>
      <br>
      [0188] With the feasibility of IBC already logically established
      across the above and earlier sections of this section, this
      section is not directly on IBC's feasibility but instead on some
      additional highly significant features of the invention, in the
      context of IBC.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Here's the gist, followed by summary elaborations:<br>
      <br>
      [0190] Self identity transfer would be reversible, as long as the
      first human's body is still alive. That reversibility would be
      possible both at the end of Step 2 (when the self identity of the
      first human would be provisionally present in both brains (i.e.
      when the entire “transfer” of self identity (i.e. rendering self
      identity present in the second brain along with in the first brain
      and then removing it from the first brain) will have yet not
      happened, only “transfer” in the sense of its provisional presence
      in both brains will have happened)) or if elected at the end of
      Step 3 (when the self identity of the first human would be present
      in the second brain only).<br>
      <br>
      [0191] The memory data that would be copied to the second brain as
      part, of Step 2 could be separately copied to the brains of
      multiple people as a separate set of Steps 1 &amp; 2 for each,
      without undertaking Step 3 for any of them. The first person's
      self identity would remain not fully transferred (i.e. not
      rendered first present in the second brain along with in the first
      brain and then removed from the first brain) until Step 3 is
      completed with any one of them, so there'd be no loss of self
      identity from the first brain regardless of undertaking Step 2 for
      several different memory-recipient brains. Because Step 3 wouldn't
      mandatorily need to be undertaken immediately after Step 2, this
      would enable a choice of candidates to transfer to over Step 3 at
      the later time when the decision to transfer self identity over
      Step 3 is taken. That choice would be meaningful because external
      circumstances might render some of the memory recipient brains
      (i.e. those for which Step 1 and Step 2 will have been done)
      subsequently unavailable/unsuitable when Step 3 is decided.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] As may be expressly inferred from the IBC details in this
      section, the actual IBC link would not need to be over physical
      wires, and could be entirely over wireless if so chosen.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] It may be importantly noted that IBC proceedings in the
      invention would first be undertaken to comprehensively complete
      memory transfer activities (i.e. undertaken primarily as part of
      Step 2 of the four steps of the invention)—a process that would
      take time and therefore would need to be commenced adequately in
      advance of the actual physical body-death of the first human and
      (as an added procedural bonus) wouldn't require continuous IBC
      connectivity (i.e. it could be done in several separate sequential
      IBC sessions/phases) since memory data once transferred and stored
      in the second brain wouldn't ordinarily need to be
      retransferred—and only the core self-identity “transfer” (i.e.
      Step 3 of the invention) (that would not necessitate much memory
      data (re)transfer, optionally other than for some new latest
      and/or earlier memory data if so elected) would be left as the
      final, separate, IBC activity to be undertaken within a short span
      of time typically not long before the actual physical body-death
      of the first human. Because this step would be separate, there
      would be no need for the two human brains to remain IBC
      (re)connected until just before the point of that quick self
      identify transfer, thereby allowing the humans complete freedom to
      go about their own separate lives following conclusion of the
      memory data transfer of Step 2, until just before the decision is
      taken for self identity to be transferred from the first human to
      the second. Appropriate of the already previously created
      artificial and natural synapses and other hardware connectivity
      “ports” created for IBC would then be quickly reused to
      reestablish IBC towards that final step, to transfer self
      identity. Also, importantly, because largely no new
      artificial/natural synapse or other “port” hardware would need to
      be created for Step 3 of the invention, and since that final act
      (per Step 3) of self identity “transfer” would essentially
      constitute enabling access to
      already-transferred-and-stored-memory at the second brain,
      temporary simultaneous presence in both brains of the
      intended-to-be transferred self identity (i.e. the logical
      unification of the two logical centers of consciousness in the two
      brains into a single one), and then “switching off” the first
      brain's component of self identity, the process of self identity
      transfer would be reversible as long as the first body is
      physically alive.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Furthermore, multiple candidates for self identity transfer
      could be readied in advance (by completing extensive memory
      transfer to each) to reasonably ensure the availability of at
      least, one candidate when self identity transfer is finally
      elected.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] These reversibility and multi-candidature aspects of self
      identity transfer would be of enormously significant practical
      benefit, as they would allow anticipatory full transfer (or
      simultaneous presence in two brains in preparation for full
      transfer) of self identity (i.e. in reasonable anticipation of
      possible physical death of the first body, for example if the
      first human is at the end stages of any terminal illness and
      therefore the body is likely to die in the imminent/near future,
      or if that first human is on an airplane that develops critical
      engine failure en route and appears unlikely to be able to land
      safely, so self identity is quickly simultaneously established in
      the second brain (i.e. simultaneous to that self identity also
      remaining in that human's own brain) over wireless IBC (to prevent
      disease transmission in the first example (of the terminally ill
      person), and wireless IBC would anyway be logistically mandatory
      in the second example (of the airline passenger)) for any one of
      multiple candidates who is healthy and who is then safely on the
      ground or elsewhere not on that particular airplane, and that self
      identity is either deliberately not fully transferred—if
      ever—until at the last, moment to maximally wait to complete Step
      3 to be sure on the likelihood of any impending physical
      body-death or transferred anyway without waiting further,
      completing Step 3), and then if so elected reverse the process
      later while still in the simultaneous-self-identity-in-two-brains
      stage (i.e. with Step 3 in progress but not completed) or even at
      a post transfer stage (i.e. with Step 3 completed) should the
      anticipated physical death of the body doesn't actually happen
      (e.g. if the person in the above first example somehow recovers
      from that terminal illness, or if the airplane in the above second
      example is able to land safely). As indicated above, even if self
      identity is fully transferred, as long as the first body is still
      alive self identity can be transferred back in a mechanism similar
      to but significantly less cumbersome than how the identity was
      transferred out in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Minimalism Option of Self Identity Transfer</b><br>
      <br>
      [0196] An optional, overall much faster but less comprehensive,
      form of perpetual persistence of life with this invention using
      IBC would be to in large part forego the extensive non-essential
      memory transfer component, and undertake primarily just the self
      identity transfer component (inclusive of the fundamental, core
      essential memory absolutely mandatory for self identity transfer)
      over IBC. Post self identity transfer the individual would still
      be consciously able to recognize herself/himself in the second
      brain and also retain the minimal core sub-/unconscious memory
      (e.g. behavioral) traits and “adjust” into a modified, yet always
      acceptable (see the final two items of “Feasibility of invention”
      earlier in this section), rendition of herself/himself with
      selections of the already preexisting memory data in the second
      brain, albeit that second brain would lack most of the
      non-essential memory data that was present in the first brain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0197] IBC is logically reasonably feasible substantially
      exceeding the thresholds necessary for medically perpetual
      persistence of essential human life. That feasibility can be
      practically demonstrated by implementing the enablement principles
      outlined in the original patent application and in this section,
      in an R &amp; D process that would take its due resources and
      time.<br>

      [0199] Towards creating the integrated, augmented, single, logical
      center of consciousness, each of the 7 brains within the dashed
      box has in this example been shown to be linked only to Mary-I's
      brain. However, in reality some links could also be chosen to be
      among themselves (i.e. contained within the dashed box) and not
      all need to be directly linked to Mary-I. Ultimately, upon
      delinking them all, ordinarily at most one brain could have
      Mary-II-B, and the rest Mary-II-A.<br>
      <br>

      [0201] In this example, the 7 brains in the dashed box are
      selectively directionally interlinked among themselves and with
      Mary-I's brain, towards the formation of the integrated, single,
      logical, augmented center of consciousness. Note that the
      directions indicate information transport (hence consciousness
      transport prospect) direction. Again, upon delinking, ordinarily
      at most ONE Mary-II-B brain may be formed, and at the rest at most
      Mary-II-A. Some can choose to retain solely their original

      [0002] This invention relates to a system and method of recording,
      sharing, and storing data and materials for selective retrieval.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0003] While much debate goes on about the reality and future of
      human immortality, the latest thinking not only points to its
      possibility, but almost inevitable probability. To understand the
      probability of human immortality in one form or another, let's
      start with the discovery and assertion of Francis Crick, the
      co-discoverer of DNA, who says this about human consciousness (or
      the “soul”) in his seminal book The Astonishing Hypothesis: The
      Scientific Search for the Soul:<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The astonishing Hypothesis is that “You,” your joys and
      your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of
      personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the
      behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Nothing more hopeful has ever come out of human existence
      than expressed in the quote above. What Francis Crick has pointed
      out is that, as humans, we will no longer need to rely on the
      existing 3 biological form we have taken to prolong our existence.
      Why? If our consciousness can be understood to be “the behavior of
      a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules,”
      then who is to say that this assembly of nerve cells and their
      associated molecules cannot be recreated or duplicated and then
      maintained to sustain our consciousness forever, thus enabling us
      to live forever? Who is to say that this behavior of a vast
      assembly of nerve cells and molecules cannot be achieved and
      maintained in some electronic or electro-biological form?<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Ray Kurzweil, of Kurzweil Industries, has authored numerous
      books on the future development of the human race and on how
      technology will soon enable us to live forever. To his credit, he
      is widely known to have predicted the fall of Communism in Eastern
      Europe in his hooks; and there are many other predictions by him
      that have come truth. Bill Gates declares Ray Kurzweil to be the
      best person I know at predicting the future of artificial
      intelligence.”<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Here is the prediction of Ray Kurzweil about how technology
      will usher in human immortality in his best-selling book The
      Singularity Is Near:<br>
      <br>
      [0008] . . . within several decades information-based technologies
      will encompass all human knowledge and proficiency, ultimately
      including the pattern-recognition power, problem-solving skills,
      and emotional and moral intelligence of the human brain itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] . . . We will gain power over our fates. Our immortality
      will be in our own hands. We will be able to live as long as we
      want . . . . We will fully understand human thinking and will
      vastly extend and expand its reach. By the end of this century,
      the non-biological portion of our intelligence will be trillions
      of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human
      intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] [When we reach the state of Singularity,] it will
      represent: the culmination of the merger of our biological
      thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world
      that is still human but that transcends our biological mots. There
      will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and
      machine or between physical and virtual reality. If you wonder
      what will remain unequivocally human in such a world, it's simply
      this quality: ours is the species that inherently seeks to extend
      its physical and mental reach beyond current limitations.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Essentially, these two experts, along with numerous others,
      have pointed to one unavoidable course of human development: our
      biological existence will soon be augmented or replaced by a
      non-biological or electro-biological existence, in one way or
      another, which may well usher in the age of immortality.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0012] Essentially, Immordata is a method, a process, and a venue
      for our customers to store their electronic and biological data,
      as well as personal physical artifacts and biological data, for
      the purpose of creating an immortal consciousness, to share
      personal and communal information with others, to build virtual
      and permanent personal and collective identities, and to prepare
      for the possible and probable human immortality where evocation of
      personal and communal consciousness and information is required.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0025] Here is the detailed description of how the Immordata will
      work, referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers
      refer to like components, a selective storage and retrieval system
      is shown at 100 in FIG. 1. The selective storage and retrieval
      system includes a network 102 operatively connected to a database
      103. One or more users 101, such as a User A 101A, a User B 101B,
      a User C 101C, and a User N 101N, are in communication via a
      network with a network engine 102. The network engine 102 may
      include a website, one or more servers operating the networking
      website, or any other device or application capable of providing
      networking services via the network 102. The users 101 can access
      the services provided by the network engine via the network 102.
      Optionally, one or more of the users 101 may be able to access the
      network engine 103 directly.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The users 101 can access the network engine 102 via a
      computing device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, a cellular
      telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a set top box, and
      so forth. The users 101 can view data about social network members
      via the network engine 102, enter data about themselves and
      possibly others, join network groups, and so forth. The users 101
      are typically members of a networking website associated with the
      network engine 102, for example, and thus include the network
      members.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Immordata Process, Method, and Other Elements:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0027] 1. Immordata customers enter the website by using the
      process detailed below:<br>
      1.1. When customers enter the Immordata website, Immordata's home
      page will greet them, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      1.2. Immordata customers will sign in by using the sign-in website
      set up for the customers, where customers will need to use a User
      Name or an Email Address and also a User Password in order to
      enter the website, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      2. The Immordata Website: Immordata will establish the website for
      data storage, data sharing, and the building of Immordata
      individuals, families, communities, cities, states, ethnicities,
      countries, the United Nations, and possibly the entire immordata
      humanity:<br>
      2.2. Web portals will be established as portals for customers to
      enter 1201, store, update, and share their written, audio, video,
      and all other electronic and personal data via the web interface,
      as shown in FIG. 12 at 1205. The data will be segmented into three
      distinct categories as shown in FIG. 12 at 1204: 1) one for public
      sharing, so others may have access to various published data, 2)
      one for sharing only within circles of family, friends, or any
      other community, and 3) one for private documentation that will
      only be viewed by each individual who enters the data and can be
      brought up as permitted by the executors of Immordata in the
      future for eventual establishment of individual immortality, as
      authorized by the individual in legal agreements.<br>
      2.3. Data submitted for publication will be subjected to data
      administrators' censorship as in FIG. 12 at 1220 and 1222. Once
      the submitted data passes censorship, the data will be published
      either to the general Internet public 1214 or to communities 1221
      lithe submitted data does not pass censorship, the data will be
      permanently deleted 1218 and 1229 and the customer will be
      notified 1210.<br>
      2.4. Customers will be reminded to store their data permanently
      1211 and customers can then submit data for permanent storage as
      in FIG. 12 at 1213 and 1215, but customers must sign up for
      financing plan, as shown at 1216, 1217 and 1223. If the financing
      plan is set up, then data is stored permanently 1213 and 1215<br>
      2.5. The websites will also enable our customers to build their
      communities 1226 as specified below, be they families,
      communities, races, ethnicities, countries, or all of humanity. As
      shown in FIG. 12, customers will be able to share their personal
      information to build communities of their own as they see fit at
      1202. The data for these communities can be permanently stored or
      not, depending on the agreements between Immordata and these
      communities.<br>
      2.6. The websites will also direct our customers to store their
      Personal Physical Artifacts in storage centers across the globe in
      secure, locked-down, fire-proof, and quake-resistant facilities
      and the websites will also direct customers to store biological
      materials in biological storage in Immordata biological storage
      centers across the globe in secure lockdown, fire-proof, and
      quake-resistant facilities as shown in FIG. 12 at 1203 and 1225.
      Customers will be required to set up a financing plan 1224. If the
      customer does not have a financing plan set up, the customer will
      be rejected and notified 1227; if the customer has a financing
      plan, then the customer will be able to store physical artifacts
      and biological materials 1230 and the customer will be notified of
      the storage 1228.<br>
      3. Immordata process and method: This is the process and method
      for customers to store their daily activities, memories, feelings,
      emotions, and reflections, etc. Furthermore, Immordata customers
      will be able to save their personal physical artifacts and
      biological data as instructed by Immordata. The process and
      methods are listed below and shown in FIG. 4:<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Data Category 1: Diaries Eternal<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Data Category 2: Audios Eternal<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Data Category 3: Visuals Eternal<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Data Category 4: Other Personal Electronic Data<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Data Category 5: Personal Artifacts Eternal<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Data Category 6: Biological Data Eternal<br>
      <br>
      3.1. Immortal Individuals:<br>
      <br>
      [0034] 3.1.1. Immortal Written Entries: this is probably the best,
      the most direct, and the most intimate way to record one's
      consciousness for eternity. Customers' written entries of their
      memories and feelings, completed daily or otherwise, shall be
      stored permanently, to be used by our customers to build their own
      eternal consciousness and to build immortal communities of various
      kinds and sizes. As shown below, the contents of the immortal
      written entries will be categorized into three: 1) Public, 2)
      Access Only for Families and Friends and Communities, and 3)
      Private. This function and the categorization will define all
      other data below to be stored with Immordata as shown in FIG. 5.
      The descriptions of the three categories will be further defined
      later in this patent application.<br>
      <br>
      3.1.2. Immortal Audios: This shall be the voice recordings of our
      customers or other sounds and voices; the data is less direct, but
      it has dimensions unavailable in written words; it also records
      our biological vocal dimension and enriches the contents of the
      recorded consciousness. The contents of this kind of data will
      also have three categories: Public, or Access Only for Families
      and Friends and Communities, or Private. The audio recordings
      shall be stored permanently, to be used by our customers to build
      their own eternal consciousness and to build immortal communities
      of various kinds and sizes. Immordata customer will enter, modify,
      or retrieve their data by using the Immordata website as shown in
      FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      3.1.3. Immortal Visuals: These are pictures or videos of
      customers; this data adds an even richer form of recording our
      consciousness, especially when we are recorded to discuss our
      memories, feelings, emotions, and reflections, or when they record
      other activities and observations. It also adds physical
      dimensions unavailable in audio and written recordings. The
      contents of this kind of data will also have three categories:
      Public, or Access Only for Families and Friends and Communities,
      or Private. These data elements are valuable in case our
      immortality may require sonic physical dimensions to establish our
      immortality. The visual recordings shall be stored permanently to
      be used by our customers to build their own eternal consciousness
      and to build immortal communities of various kinds and sizes.
      Immordata customer will enter, modify, or retrieve their data by
      using the Immordata website as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      3.1.4. Other Electronic immortal Data: Customer may record any
      other electronic data they deem necessary to record their
      consciousness, such as medical records, publications of relevant
      subjects or events, or whatever electronic data. This data will
      enrich recordings of customers' consciousness. The contents of
      this kind of data will also have three categories: Public, or
      Access Only for Families and Friends and Communities, or Private.
      These recordings shall be stored permanently to be used by
      customers to build their own eternal consciousness and to build
      immortal communities of various kinds and sizes. Immordata
      customer will enter, modify, or retrieve their data by using the
      Immordata website as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      3.1.5. Immortal Personal Artifacts: This will be a collection of
      personal physical artifacts, in limited spaces, to aid in the
      revival of personal consciousness of our customers. These personal
      physical artifacts, be they scrapbooks, old photos, letters, small
      collections, samples of any materials things with personal
      connections, will be stored permanently for customers, to be used
      by our customers to build their own eternal consciousness and to
      build immortal communities of various kinds and sizes. Immordata
      customer will enter, modify, or retrieve their data by using the
      Immordata website as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
      3.1.6. Biological Data Eternal: This will be a collection of
      personal biological data, to aid in the revival of personal
      consciousness of our customers. This personal biological data,
      whatever form it may take (DNA, tissue, MRI, etc.), will be stored
      permanently for customers, to be used by our customers to build
      their own eternal consciousness and to build immortal communities
      of various kinds and sizes. Immordata customer will be able to
      update their biological information continuously. The process for
      biological data storage is shown in FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      3.2. Immortal Families: The data for the Immordata Families can be

      <br>
      3.7. Immortal Humanity:<br>
      <br>
      [0039] 3.7.1. This is far-sighted, but if the Singularity occurs,
      as predicted by Ray Kurzweil, the entire Singularity may use the
      Immordata website and process to share their data, activities,
      news, thoughts, knowledge, photos, videos, physical artifacts, or
      any other such information as specified in the content categories
      later in this application and record their activities, thoughts,
      feelings, visuals, voices, and all other information as specified
      in the content categories later in this application.<br>
      <br>
      3.7.2. Were that to happen, the Singularity may use the Immordata
      website and its process for whatever purposes, but within the
      confines of the law at the time when the Singularity occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In FIG. 11, there is a preliminary webpage that enables
      Immordata customers to form their Immortal Families, Communities,
      Neighborhoods, Groups, Cities, Countries, Ethnicities.
      States/Provinces/Prefectures, United Nations, or whatever
      community, or the Singularity, as shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In FIG. 12, a high-level flow chart delineates the process
      that governs the operations of Immordata process.<br>
      <br>
      4. The Data Base Storage: Data storages will be established to
      permanently and securely store our customers' data resulting from
      our customers' writings, recordings, and collections.<br>
      <br>
      4.1. Electronic data will be stored at the secure sites. Security
      will be of the uttermost importance, so the data storage will be
      established in the most secure locations.<br>
      <br>
      4.1.1. Legal agreements will be established with customers on how
      data is to be shared or protected, and on how the eventual data
      will be used to establish individual immortality by using the data
      of their consciousness. The latest technology is available to
      store electronic data for thousands of years, and future
      technology will avail itself to preserve the data permanently.<br>
      <br>
      4.1.2. Data Integrity: Immordata will establish a process in which
      the data will be stored permanently; Immordata will make sure
      Immordata data will forever be securely stored and will be safe to
      retrieve by ensuring all technological updates for the data
      storage.<br>
      <br>
      4.2. Physical collections of Immordata customers will be stored in
      secured, fire-proof, water-proof, quake-resistant, and
      damage-proof storage facilities, to aid in the eventual evocation
      or retrieval of the consciousness data, in order to establish
      individual immortality by using their data of their consciousness.
      Security will be of the uttermost importance, so the data storage
      will be established in the most secure location.<br>
      <br>
      4.3. Biological data: In case the future requires biological data,
      permanent DNA data and other biological data will be stored to
      enable customers to store their biological data, in case the
      eventual building of individual immortality needs the biological
      data. At the suitable time, Immordata may choose to form its own
      biological data storage company, so our customers will trust that
      their biological data is secure with Immordata, like the other
      data they have storied with Immordata,<br>
      <br>
      4.4. Financing Plan:<br>
      <br>
      [0041] 4.4.1. A financing plan will be established as an option
      for Immordata customers to enable the permanent data storage,
      until such a time as it is viable to transfer the Immordata from
      storage to a non-biological or altered biological form to let it:
      live permanently. The financial cost for permanent storage of all
      this data will be born by the principal amount in the form of an
      endowment and the resulting interest, as established by the
      financing plan.<br>
      <br>
      4.4.2. Some of the Immordata costs will be borne by the income
      from advertising revenues as part of the Immordata is made public
      for viewing, discussion, and exchange.<br>
      <br>
      5. Evocation of Immordata to Build Immortal Individuals, Families,
      or Communities of Varying Scales<br>
      <br>
      [0042] 5.1. immordata will select an executive committee of the
      best scientists, community leaders, and prominent citizens in the
      world and form the Immordata Congress, whose responsibility is to
      assess the maturity of the technology to build and sustain
      immortal individuals in the future. The structure and
      decision-making process shall be determined by Immordata.<br>
      5.2. The decision of the Immordata Congress will be the decision
      Immordata will follow to evoke the private and public data to
      build immortal individuals.<br>
      5.3. The process to execute this decision will be outline by the
      Immordata Board of Directors and its executive officers, to be
      detailed in its company charter.<br>
      5.4. Immordata shall abide by all laws in the community in which
      it operates for all its operations and activities, without
      exception.<br>
      <br>
      Further Definition of Immordata Contents:<br>
      <br>
      [0043] This section is to detail some of the contents of the
      immordata, but not exclusively, so the patent's utility and its
      ease of application can be easily understood.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 1. Life Story: Below is a potential but not exhaustive list

      2. Feelings, Emotions, Thoughts, or any other mental activity or
      state: Immordata customers can use the Immordata website and
      databases to build their consciousness; that is, everyone can
      continuously make entries under each feeling, emotion, and thought
      in the categories (though not exclusive) listed below. This will
      enrich the volume of the consciousness, making sure that your
      consciousness is entirely you, beautifully you, and glorious you,
      rich, plentiful, detailed, and fully dimensioned. Furthermore, all
      the rich experiences, emotions, wisdom, and knowledge, etc., will
      build a collective human consciousness that is more interactive
      than otherwise possible. The vision is that, as an aggregate
      whole, this collective human consciousness, as supported by the
      individual consciousness, will evolve into something far greater
      than anything that we have thus far witnessed in human
      civilization. And, if we have the far-reaching vision of billions
      of years from now, we will need this collective human
      consciousness and knowledge to jump out of this universe, as this
      universe is, based on scientific consensus, to collapse in one way
      or another. If that is to happen, the most probable way to escape
      this universe is the electronic collective consciousness that
      Immordata and its customers and users will be able to start
      building.<br>
      2.1. Below is a list of possible but not exhaustive feelings,
      memories, emotions, thoughts, etc., which an Immordata customer
      can record and store:<br>

      Immordata customer<br>
      2.2. At the same time, Immordata customers can keep an Immordata
      diary, making daily entries and going back to the entries to make
      updates. This will be convenient and will help Immordata customers
      to build a habit of daily entries, which will enable the Immordata
      customers to detail their daily activities, feeling, emotions,
      reflections, etc., on a daily basis, thus making the collection of
      Immordata detailed, complete, rich, and comprehensive.<br>
      <br>
      3. Building a Future:<br>
      <br>
      [0044] 3.1. Community Forming: Using existing data, Immordata
      customers can build their communities of various kinds and levels,
      such as families, neighborhoods, cities, counties, states,
      provinces, prefectures, cantons, countries, or even the virtual
      United Nations.<br>
      3.2. Explorations of New Frontiers: Using existing data, Immordata
      customers can explore new potentials that are not yet thought of
      by the greatest theorists. But the data stored and operated by
      Immordata will build a base for them to spring from and provide a
      venue for such explorations.<br>
      <br>
      The Different Levels of Data Storage:<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Immordata data will be categorized into three different
      databases, as shown in FIG. 12: public data, limited-access data,
      and private data (1204), to be detailed below. The purpose of
      three different levels of data is that some Immordata data can be
      shared with the public; some may be shared only with families,
      friends, or authorized legal entities; but some will be private to
      the individuals only, and, as such, should be use only to be
      evoked at such a time as deemed appropriate by Immordata and the
      Immordata Congress to build individual immortality when such
      technology avails itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 1. The Public Immordata Data: Immordata customers will
      store data here that, is made public to varying groups:<br>
      1.1. Data public to everyone: This is the kind of data the
      Immordata customers will choose to be made public to anyone
      browsing the Immordata public information areas.<br>
      1.2. Data to be shared only with varying circles: This is the kind
      of data the Immordata customers will choose to be made available
      only to people he/she will give consent to, such as friends,
      families, special groups, clubs, organizations, or whomever.<br>
      2. The Confidential Immordata Data for Families, Friends, Groups,
      and Communities of Their Choice: Immordata customers will store
      data here that will be shared with families and friends or
      authorized legal entities, such as doctors and lawyers, who have
      access to it. The data will not be available to the general
      public, but will be shared among Immordata customers who are
      granted the access by the Immordata customer, so that data can be
      shared within limited circles. The access can be granted or
      revoked by the Immordata customer who has created the data, but
      Immordata and the Immordata Congress will have the ultimate
      decision on whether the access should be granted, based on the
      power it is granted by the concurrent law.<br>
      3. The Private Immordata Data: Immordata customers will store data
      here that is guarded and will not be shared with anyone, as in the
      case of lawyer-client or physician-patient privileges, to be only
      used to build immortality for Immordata customers. Even when such
      information is used to build immortality for Immordata customers,
      this information will be used only for the immortal individual,
      not shared with anyone else in any situation for any purpose. It
      shall never be made public forever. This database is the crux of
      the trust between Immordata and its customers, without which
      Immordata cannot function or survive as a viable venue, method, or
      process to store our customers' data for purposes of immortality.<br>
      <br>
      How It Benefits Mankind<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The benefits of the present invention are many:<br>
      <br>
      1. Learning Forever<br>
      <br>
      [0047] 1.1. In the electronic form this Immordata existence will
      enable every consciousness or soul to learn forever, when the
      technology makes it possible for the immortal consciousness or
      soul to be live again.<br>
      1.2. The assumption is that all human short comings of the mind
      are rooted in the fact that the biological and neurological mind
      was constrained and confined within the biological boundaries of
      the human brain. A fully developed mind, in a form other than
      biological, will transcend its biological roots and rise above
      them to great heights of enlightenment, understanding,
      capabilities, and unlimited achievements.<br>
      <br>
      2. Full Utilization of Latent Human Intelligence:<br>
      <br>
      [0048] 2.1. We know much knowledge, wisdom, and creativity pass
      with the passing of a great mind or any mind. The recording or
      storage of these great minds could prevent such passing or loss.
      Just imagine, how many more ideas were still floating in
      Einstein's mind when he passed? And how many patent examiners like
      Einstein have passed without: writing down his or her great ideas?
      What would have happened if Leonardo de Vinci had written down his
      helicopter idea in more detail before his passing? Could the
      modern helicopter have been invented centuries earlier? Just
      imagine all the great ideas and minds of the billions of humans
      that have not been made known. How do we know those hidden or
      private ideas will not transform humanity entirely? What if
      suddenly we can harvest all those ideas and communicate all those
      ideas to each other for further advances? Could the human
      civilization see quantum leaps forward as a result?<br>
      2.2. I think it is a sure bet that, with the establishment of
      Immordata and later the evocation of Immordata to form immortal
      individuals and communal human immortality, this sea of knowledge,
      the vast collection of ideas, the immense wisdom, the endless
      scientific and technological know-how, and all that the human
      minds possess will make the human race not only a better race, but
      also a far more powerful race, enabling it: to achieve things one
      cannot even possibly imagine at this point in time.<br>
      <br>
      3. Next Stage of Human Development<br>
      <br>
      [0049] 3.1. Humans will probably no longer form prejudices related
      to physical attributes because the ultimate existence is in the
      realm of bio-electronics or some other advanced form.<br>
      3.2. It is possible that all souls will be connected in some form,
      thus forming a collective consciousness, which, as a part of the
      collective whole, is far more powerful, potent, productive, and
      beneficial than otherwise.<br>
      3.3. The probable immortal world in a form other than biological,
      such as the Singularity, also has a higher level or survivability,
      if we are to survive the disintegration of the universe in, say,
      30 billion years, or in any length of time in which our universe
      will last.<br>
      3.4. This immortal world will enable souls or consciousness to
      continue to learn.<br>
      3.5. Because of this continuous learning, the souls and
      consciousnesses will evolve into higher beings with higher moral
      standards and better understanding, thus improving the souls and
      consciousnesses. Because of all that development, evil spirits and
      debased souls will transform to become better souls and
      consciousnesses.<br>
      3.6. Souls and consciousness will then command vast reservoirs of
      knowledge, thus being able to make better decisions, make new
      discoveries, improve the world tremendously, and eventually even
      find ways to survive the collapse of this universe and transport
      into another universe, were that to happen, to continue the human
      race and the human consciousness.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0005] The inventor shows that human soul is only the information
      in human brain. He offers a new method for re-writing the human
      brain on electronic chips. This method allows for the modeling of
      a human soul in order to achieve immortality. This method does not
      damage the brain but works to extend and enhance it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0006] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0007] Immortality is the most cherished dream and the biggest
      wish of any person. People seldom think about it while they are
      still young, healthy, and full of energy. But when they get some
      incurable disease or become old, then there is no bigger wish for
      them than to live longer, put off the inevitable end. And no
      matter what heavenly existence in the after-life is promised to
      them by religion, the vast majority of people want to stay and
      enjoy life here, on Earth, as long as possible. The inventor shows
      a real immortality can be only electronically.<br>
      <br>
      Medical Science and the Issue of Immortality<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A great many of doctors and scientists are currently
      working on the problems of health and longevity. Substantial means
      are spent on it, about 15-25% of all human labor and resources.
      There are certain achievements in this direction: we have created
      wonderful medications (e.g. antibiotics); conquered many diseases;
      learnt to transplant human organs; created an artificial heart,
      kidneys, lungs, limbs; learnt to apply physiological solutions
      directly into the blood stream, and to saturate blood with oxygen.
      We have gotten inside the most sacred organ—the human brain, even
      inside its cells. We can record their signals, we can agitate some
      parts of the brain by electric stimuli inducing a patient to
      experience certain sensations, images, and hallucinations.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] We can attribute the fact that the average life span has
      increased two times in the last two hundred years to the
      achievements of modern medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] But can medical science solve the problem of immortality?
      Evidently, it cannot. It cannot do that in principle. This is a
      dead-end direction in science. Maximum it can achieve is
      increasing the average life expectancy another 5-10 years. An
      average person will be expected to live 80 years instead of 70.
      But what kind of person will it be? A very old one, capable of
      only existing and consuming, whose medical and personal care will
      demand huge funds.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The proportion of the elderly and retirees has increased
      steeply in the last 20-30 years and continues to grow depleting
      the pension funds and pressuring the younger generation to support
      them. So it is hard to say whether the modern success of medicine
      is a blessing or a curse from the point of view of the entire
      humankind, even though it is definitely a blessing from the point
      of view of a separate individual.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Humanity as a whole, as a civilization, needs active, able
      to work and creative members, generating material wealth and
      moving forward technology and science, not the elderly retirees
      with their numerous ailments and a huge army of those tending to
      them. It dreams not of the immortality of an old person, but of
      the immortality of youthfulness, activity, creativity, enjoying
      life.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Now there are signs of a breakthrough, but not in the
      direction the humankind has been working on all along, since the
      times of the first sorcerers to modern-day highly-educated
      doctors. Striving to prolong his biological existence, man has
      been chiseling, so to speak, at the endless stone wall. All he has
      been able to accomplish is only a dent in that wall—increased life
      expectancy, conquering some diseases, relieving suffering. As a
      payoff, the humanity has received a huge army of pensioners and
      retirees and gigantic expenditure on their upkeep.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Of course, one can continue chiseling at the dent in the
      wall further on, make it somewhat bigger, aggravating side
      effects. But we are already approaching the biological limit, when
      the cause of death and feeblemindedness is not a certain disease
      which can be conquered, but general deterioration of the entire
      organism, its decay on the cellular level, when the cells stop to
      divide. A live cell is a very complex biological formation. In its
      nucleus it has DNA—biological molecules consisting of tens of
      thousands of atoms connected between themselves with very fragile
      molecular links. Suffice it to say, that temperature fluctuation
      of only a few degrees can ruin these links. That is why a human
      organism maintains a certain temperature—36.7 C. Raising this
      temperature only 2-3 degrees causes pain, and 5-7 degrees leads to
      death. Maintaining the existence of human cells also presents a
      big problem for humanity involving food, shelter, clothes and
      ecologically clean environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Nevertheless, human cells cannot exist eternally even under
      ideal conditions. This follows from the atomic-molecular theory.
      Atoms of biological molecules permanently oscillate and interact
      with each other. According to the theory of probability, sooner or
      later the impulses of adjacent atoms influencing the given atom,
      add up, and the atom acquires enough speed to break loose from its
      atomic chain, or at least to transfer into the adjacent position
      (physicists say that the impulse received by the atom has
      surpassed the energy threshold which retains the atom in its
      particular place in the molecular chain). It also means that the
      cell containing this atom has been damaged and cannot any longer
      function normally. Thus, for example, we get cancer cells which
      cannot fulfill their designated functions any more and begin to
      proliferate abnormally fast and ruin human organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This process accelerates manifold when a person has been
      exposed to a strong electromagnetic radiation, for instance,
      Roentgen or X-rays, a high-frequency electric current or
      radioactive materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Actually, the process of deforming of the hereditary DNA
      molecule under the influence of weak cosmic rays can take place
      from time to time, leading sometimes to birth defects, or it may
      turn out to be useful for the survival properties. And this plays
      a positive role for a particular species of plants or animals
      contributing to their adaptability to the changed environment and
      their survival as a species. But for a particular individual such
      aberration is a tragedy as a rule, since the overwhelming majority
      of such cases are birth defects, with only few cases of useful
      mutations. And human society in general is suspicious of people
      who are radically different in their looks or abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>

      information in human brain. He offers a method for re-writing the
      human brain on electronic chips. This method allows for the

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INNOVATION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> 1. Brief Description of Previous Works by the Inventor</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0032] In a series of articles (see referenced list at the end)
      the inventor shows that the purpose of Nature is to create Super
      Intelligence (SI). With its ability to understand the Universe,
      advanced entities with SI Power will be able to survive major
      cataclysms. There is the Law of Increasing Complexity (in
      opposition to the Entropy Law—increasing chaos). This Law created
      biological intelligence (people). Human have since became a
      sovereign entity on the Earth and in Nature above all other
      creatures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Electronic Immortality. Advantages of Electronic Existence</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0033] In the noted works the author has shown that the problem of
      immortality can be solved only by changing the biological human
      into an artificial form. Such an immortal person made of chips and
      super-solid material (the E-man, as was called in his articles)
      will have incredible advantages in comparison to conventional
      people. An E-man will need no food, no dwelling, no air, no sleep,
      no rest, and no ecologically pure environment. His brain will work
      from radio-isotopic batteries (which will work for decades) and
      muscles that will work on small nuclear engines. Such a being will
      be able to travel into space and walk on the sea floor with no
      aqualungs. He will change his face and figure. He will have
      super-human strength and communicate easily over long distances to
      gain vast amounts of knowledge in seconds (by re-writing his
      brain). His mental abilities and capacities will increase millions
      of times. It will be possible for such a person to travel huge
      distances at the speed of light. The information of one person
      like this could be transported to other planets with a laser beam
      and then placed in a new body.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Such people will not be awkward robots as in the movies. An
      artificial person will have the opportunity to choose his or her
      face, body and skin. It will also be possible for them to
      reproduce and then avoid any period of adolescence including the
      need for education. It will be impossible to destroy this entity
      with any kind of weapons, since it will be possible to copy the
      information of their minds and than keep such information backed
      up in separate distant locations. As was written in the science
      fiction book, “The Price of Immortality”, by Igor Getmansky
      (Moscow, Publish House ECSMO, 2003, Russian) an artificial person
      will have all of these super-human abilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. What are Men and Intelligent Beings</b><br>
      <br>
      [0035] All intelligent creatures have two main components: 1.
      Information about their environment, about their experience of
      interacting with nature, people, society (soul) and 2. Capsule
      (shell), where this information is located (biological brain,
      body). The capsule supports existence and stores information and
      programs for all of its operations. The capsule also allows the
      creature to acquire different sensory information (eyes, ear,
      nose, tongue and touch) and it moves to different locations in
      order to interact with the environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The main component of an intelligent being is information
      (soul). The experiences and knowledge accumulated in the soul
      allows the entity to interact more efficiently in nature in order
      to survive. If the being has more information and better
      operational programs (ability to find good solutions), then it is
      more likely thrive.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] For an intelligent being to save its soul it must solve the
      problem of individual immortality. Currently man creates a soul
      for himself by acquiring knowledge from parents, educational
      systems, employment and life experiences. When he dies, most
      knowledge is lost except for a very small part which is left
      through works, children and apprentices. Billions of people have
      lived on Earth, however, we know comparatively little about
      ancient history. Only after the invention of written language did
      people have the capacity to easily save knowledge and pass it on
      to the next generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As discussed earlier, the biological storage (human brain)
      of our soul (information) is unreliable. The brain is difficult to
      maintain and requires food, lodging, clothes, a good environment
      and education, etc. To support the brain and body, humans spend
      about 99% of their time and energy, and eventually what knowledge
      is gained is taken to the grave in death.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] There is only one solution to this problem—re-write all of
      the brain information (our soul) in more strongly based storage.
      We must also give the soul the possibility to acquire and
      manipulate information from the world. This means we must give
      sensors to the soul so it may have communication and contact with
      people and other intelligent beings. We must give the soul a
      mobile system (for example, legs), systems for working (hands),
      etc. thus giving the soul a new body in which to LIVE.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The reader may ask—these ideas seem interesting, but how
      does one we re-write a human soul to live within a new carrier,
      for example, in electronic chips?<br>
      <br>
      4. The Main Problem With Electronic Immortality—Re-Writing Brain
      Information (Soul) to Electronic Chips is That it's Impossible to
      do This With Current Technology<br>
      <br>
      [0041] At present scientists are working to solve this problem.
      They know that the brain has about 15 billion neurons, and every
      neuron has about ten connections to neighboring neurons. Neurons
      gain signals from neighboring neurons, produce signals and then
      send these signals to others neurons. As a result, humans are able
      to think and find solutions. On the bases of this way of thinking,
      humans can come to solutions without exact data. (Concepts of
      brain were described in my previous articles. For example, see
      “Locate God in Computer-Internet Networks” or “Science, Soul,
      Heaven and Supreme Mind”. See also my articles on the Internet and
      references at end of this article.).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Scientists are learning how to take individual neurons on
      micro-electrodes and record their impulses. The ideas of
      scientists are very simple—study how single neurons and small
      neuronal network work and then model them by computer. They
      hypothesize that if we can model 15 billion neurons in a computer
      they will learn how the brain works, and then they will have
      Artificial Intelligence equaling the human brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In my previous work I show this as a dead-end direction for
      Human Immortality. It's true that we'll create an Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) that will be more powerful than the human mind.
      However, it will be HIS AI, and a NEW entity altogether. Our
      purpose is focused on preserving the CONCRETE PERSON now (more
      exactly—his SOUL) in a new body in order to achieve immortality.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Why is it impossible to directly write the information of
      the human brain onto a chip? Because the human brain is constantly
      changing and neurons permanently change their states. Imagine you
      want to record the state of a working computer chip. The chip has
      millions of logical elements which change their state millions of
      times per second. It is obvious that if you write in series (one
      after other) the current state of the chip (it is impossible to
      instantly write ALL states of the chip's elements). To instantly
      write all neurons one would need to insert a microelectrode into
      EVERY neuron, this would destroy the human brain before the
      writing was complete.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] I offered another method for the solution of the Main
      Problem of Immortality.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Modeling of Soul for a Concrete Person</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0046] As said, straight re-writing of a human mind (human soul)
      to chips is very complex. Straight re-writing is not possible in
      the near future. All scientific works studying the work of human
      brains at the present time are useless for the main problem of
      immortality. They are also unworkable for the problem of
      artificial intelligence (AI) in the near term, because the brain
      solves problems by way of general estimations. AI solves problems
      based on more exact computation and logical data.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] To solve the Main Problem of Immortality (MPI) the author
      offers a method of “MODELLING SOUL” of a concrete person. This
      method does not require interventions into the brain of a given
      person. This method may be applied IMMEDIATELY at the present
      time. But an accurate modeling is needed depending on the modeling
      period.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Before describing this method, let us analyze the human
      soul and what components are important for each person and his
      environment. All information in the human brain (soul) may be
      separated in two unequal groups: 1. the Memory (permanent
      knowledge) about the person's life (all that has been seen, heard,
      made, felt, people which he has met, his (her) behaviors,
      opinions, wishes, dreams, programs of activity, etc.),
      environment, and 2. Methods of processing this information, i.e.
      producing new solutions and new behaviors based on this knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The first part (knowledge) is very large. It fills most of
      the memory and remains relatively constant (you remember your
      life, history and you can only fill it by what was in the past).
      The second part (methods for deciding, producing solutions based
      in your knowledge) is relatively small and constantly changing
      because of new information, facts and life experiences.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] However, the most important part of a human soul can be
      written without any problem now. Industry is producing cheap
      micro-video recorders as small as a penny, microphones at grain
      size, and micro-sensors for vital signs (breathing, palpitation,
      blood pressure, skin resistance, perspiration, movement of body
      parts, etc.). These measurements allow for easy recording of not
      only the physical state, but of his moral state (joy, pleasure,
      grief, trouble, anxiety, nervousness, etc). For example, lie
      detectors are able to define not only the state of a man, but also
      the truth of his words. Now we can measure and record brain
      commands and we can produce small cards with four gigabytes of
      memory.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] It would be easy to attach a video recorder and microphone
      to a man's forehead and then attach sensors to the body and record
      all that he sees, hears, speaks, his feelings, reactions, and
      activity. And then re-write this information into a personal hard
      drive (long-term memory of high capacity storage) at the end of
      each day. As a result, there is a record of the most important
      part our soul—history of life, feelings, environment, behaviors
      and actions. This would be more detailed than what is captured by
      the real man, because the humans forget many facts, feelings,
      emotions, and personal interactions. The electronic memory would
      not forget anything in the past. It would not forget any person or
      what they were doing.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] But what about the second smaller part of the human
      soul—producing solutions based on personal knowledge—perhaps asks
      the meticulous reader.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] This could be restored by using past information from the
      real man in similar situations. Moreover, an electronic man could
      analyze more factors and data in order to throw-out and exclude
      actions and emotions that happened under bad conditions. The
      electronic man (named E-being in my previous works) would have a
      gigantic knowledge base and could in a matter of second (write to
      his brain) produce the right answer, much faster than his
      biological prototype. That means he would not have the need for
      the second smaller part of memory.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Considering the environment and friends, the following is
      an important part of a man's soul: his relationship with parents,
      children, family, kin, friends, known people, partners and
      enemies. This part of his soul will be preserved more completely
      than even his prototype. Temporary factors will not influence his
      relationship with his enemy and friends as would happen with his
      former prototype.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] There is one problem which may be troubling for some: if we
      were to record every part of a person's life, how do we keep
      intimate moments a secret? There are (will be) ways to protect
      private information which could be adapted from current usage, for
      example, the use of a password (known only by you). Also there may
      be some moments you choose not to record information or decide to
      delete the information from memory.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The offered system may become an excellent tool for defense
      again lies and false accusations. You may give the password in one
      given moment of your life, which proves your alibi or absence from
      the accusations.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Some people want to have better memory. Video takes 95% of
      storage capacity, sound takes 4% and the rest takes 1%. In usual
      situations, video can record only separate pictures, sound only
      when it appears. This type of recording practice decreases the
      necessary memory by tens of times. But every 1.5-2 years chip
      storage capacity doubles. There are systems which will compress
      the information and then may select to record the most important
      information (as is done in the human brain). During your life, the
      possibility to record all information will be available for all
      people. This type of recording apparatus will be widely available
      and inexpensive. It's possible now. The most advanced video
      recorder or DVD writes more information than a CD.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] This solution (recording of human souls) is possible and
      must be solved quickly. By mass production (large productions) the
      apparatus will become inexpensive. The price will drop to about
      $300-1,000. If we work quickly we can begin recording and then
      more fully save our souls. The best solution is to begin recording
      in children when they become aware of “I”. But middle and older
      people should not delay. Unrecorded life periods may be restored
      by pictures, memories, notes, diaries and documents. Soul recovery
      will only be partial but it's better than nothing.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] These records will also be useful in your daily life. You
      can restore recorded parts of your life, images of people,
      relatives, and then analyze and examine your actions for
      improvement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Disadvantages of Biological Men and Biological Society</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0060] People understand Darwin's law, “survival of the fittest”.
      For a single person, this law is the struggle for his/her personal
      existence (life, well-being, satisfaction of requirements, pride,
      etc.). In a completely biological world built on Darwinian law the
      strongest survives and reaches his goal. Though they may be
      intelligent, humans are members of the animal world. They operate
      as any other animal in accordance with animal instincts of
      self-preservation. If one is poor, at first he struggles for food
      (currently half of world's population is starving), dwelling, and
      better living conditions. When one reaches material well-being, he
      may struggle for money, job promotion, reputation, renown, power,
      attractive women (men), and so on. Most people consider their
      activities (include official work) in only one way—what will I
      receive from it? Only a small number of people are concerned with
      the idea of sacrificing themselves to the well-being (seldom
      giving up their life) of society at large.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As a result, we see human history as a continuation of
      wars, dictatorships, and repression of people by power. Dictators
      kill all dissidents and opponents. Most people try to discriminate
      against opponents and play dirty against their enemy. There are
      murders, rapes, violence, robbery, underhand actions, fraud, and
      lying at all levels of society especially in lesser developed
      countries. Each person only cares for himself and his family and
      does not care how his actions effect other people or society.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Democratic countries try to cultivate a more civilized
      society. They create laws, courts, and have police. Dictator
      regimes, on the other hand, make only the law they want. I could
      give thousands of examples to verify this concept. But hundreds of
      millions of people are killed by war, aggressive campaigns,
      repressions, genocides, and thousands of criminals in the everyday
      world are a good illustration of this.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The human brain allows us to reach great success in science
      and technology. However, as a biological heritage, struggling for
      his INDIVIDUAL existence in a bloody, dangerous world, humans
      spend much of their resources on mutual extermination of
      intelligent beings. Moreover, humans have created ever powerful
      weapons (for example, nuclear and hydrogen bombs), which could
      wipe out humanity. In time, existence may depend on the volition
      of one man—perhaps the dictator of a nuclear state.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The second significant drawback to the biological body—is
      that it spends 99.99% of its effort and resources simply to
      support existence. Such as food, lodgings, clothing, sex,
      entertainment, relaxation, environment, ecological compatibility.
      Only a very small part is uses for scientific development and new
      ideas and technology. The reader may see something wrong here.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] States use a parentage of their revenue for research into
      science and technology. This percent is used NOT for NEW ideas,
      but is used to commercialize modern processes All research is
      included in the state budget under the name, “Science and New
      Technology”. But much of this research has little relation to real
      new scientific progress. Even it the US, states spend only a small
      part of the assigned money on new science because state officers
      do not understand the research. People, organizations, and
      companies fight for a piece of the pie. Geniuses are rare and
      usually don't have the capacity to move forward because they must
      promote and pay for new ideas from their own empty packets.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Yet, science and technology has seen success. Most
      advancement (90%) was made recently in the 20th century, when
      governments started to finance a few scientific projects (compared
      with the millions of years of human existence). However, our
      current knowledge and new technologies are far from what we will
      eventually have. The first government of an industrialized country
      to understand and realize the leading role of new science and
      innovation will become powerful.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Electronic Society</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0067] The electronic society will be a society of clever
      electronic beings (or E-being, as they named in my articles). Most
      of the reasons and stimulus which incite men to crime, will be
      absent in E-beings. E-beings will not need food, shelter, sex,
      money, or ecology, which are the main factors in crime. E-people
      will not have intense infatuations or be distracted by behaviors,
      because they will have vast knowledge about the open electronic
      society. Their main work will be in science, innovations, and
      technologies. They will save their mental capacity for the
      production of chips and bodies, scientific devices, experimental
      equipments, space ships and space station, etc. They will need a
      number of robots, which do not need a big brain. It is likely they
      will award these robots better minds and memory. It is also likely
      that E-man will unite in a common distributed hyper-brain, which
      will become a sovereign of the Universe (God).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Nature is infinite and the development of a Super Brain
      (God) will not be limited. On the other hand, biological people
      will have limited mental capabilities. It will be difficult for
      them to image and predict the development and activity of Super
      beings, which we will generate.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Many, especially religious people, object because they say
      electronic beings will not have human senses such as love,
      sympathy, kindness, humanism, altruism, and the capacity to make
      mistakes, etc. E-beings are not people. Look back at human
      history. Human history shows that kindness played a very small
      role in human life. All human history is the history of human
      vices and human blood: struggle for power, authority, impact,
      money, riches, territory, and states. All human history is filled
      with fraud, underhanded actions, and trickery. Ordinary people
      were only playthings, flock of sheep for the tyrants and
      dictators.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Some people object that with an electronic face humans will
      loss the joy of sex, alcohol, narcotics, appreciation of art,
      beauty, nature, etc. My answer to this question is in my article
      “Science, Soul, Heaven, and Supreme Mind”
      (http://Bolonkin.narod.ru). The brief answer is that electronic
      humans will enjoy all this in a virtual world or virtual paradise.
      Time will run millions of times faster in the virtual World. E-man
      will spend a few seconds of real time and live millions of years
      in the paradise. He will enjoy any delight imaginable, include sex
      with any beautiful women (or handsome men), feel the emotions of
      any commander, leader, criminal, or even a dog.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. Lot (Fortune) of Humanity</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0071] Biological humanity will be gradually transformed to
      electronic beings. Old people, when their biological bodies can
      not support their brains, will continue their existing in
      electronic bodies after death. They will become young, handsome,
      robust, and. Fertility in biological men will decrease.
      Birth-rates are less than death-rates in many civilized countries
      now (for example in France). Population growth is mainly supported
      by emigration from lesser developed countries. When education
      levels increase, birth-rates will fall.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] For a time, biological and electronic people will exist
      together. However the distance between their capabilities will
      increase very quickly. Electronic people will reproduce (multiple)
      by coping, learn instantly, and will not need food or dwellings.
      They will work full days in any condition such as in space or on
      the ocean floor. They will gain new knowledge in a short time.
      They will pass this knowledge on to others who do not have enough
      time. The distance between biological and artificial intellects
      will reach a wide margin so that biological people will not
      understand anything about new science as monkeys do not understand
      multiplication now even after much explanation.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] It is obvious, clever people will see that there will be a
      huge difference between the mental abilities of biological and
      electronic entities. They will try to transfer into electronic
      form and the ratio between biological and electronic entity will
      quickly change in electronic favor. A small number of outliers
      will continue to live in their biological body in special
      enclaves. They will not have industrial power or higher education
      and will begin to degrade.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Naysayers may promote laws against transferring into an
      electronic man (as cloning is forbidden now in some states).
      However, who would renounce immortality for themselves, especially
      while they are young and healthy? One may denounce immorality as
      blasphemy, but when your (parents, wife, husband, children) die,
      especially if you are near death yourself, one comes to understand
      that life is extremely important. The possibility to live forever,
      to gain knowledge that improves life, will also allow one to
      become a sovereign force in the Universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] We summarize all said in the following steps and devices:<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention resulted from my combining God's gift of
      reincarnation with love.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] In Chapter 4 of the London translation of the Holy Bible,
      paragraph 8 says "He that loveth not knowth not God; for God is
      love." and paragraph 16 says "And we have known and believed the
      love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in
      love dwelleth in God, and God in him."<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The scope and extent of my invention is defined in the
      following claim:<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] This invention resulted from my combining Einstein's Theory
      of Relativity and Newton's Second Law of Physics.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Reincarnation is defined in Webster's Third New
      Inernational Dictionary as "rebith". Thus my invention is a
