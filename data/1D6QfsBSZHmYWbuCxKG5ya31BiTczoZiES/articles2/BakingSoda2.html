      Even the most aggressive cancers which have metastasized have been
      reversed with baking soda cancer treatments. Although chemotherapy
      is toxic to all cells, it represents the only measure that
      oncologists employ in their practice to almost all cancer
      patients. In fact, 9 out of 10 cancer patients agree to
      chemotherapy first without investigating other less invasive
      options.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors and pharmaceutical companies make money from it. That’s
      the only reason chemotherapy is still used. Not because it’s
      effective, decreases morbidity, mortality or diminishes any
      specific cancer rates. In fact, it does the opposite. Chemotherapy
      boosts cancer growth and long-term mortality rates and oncologists
      know it.<br>
      <br>
      A few years ago, University of Arizona Cancer Center member Dr.
      Mark Pagel received a $2 million grant from the National
      Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of personalized
      baking soda cancer treatment for breast cancer. Obviously there
      are people in the know who have understood that sodium
      bicarbonate, that same stuff that can save a person’s life in the
      emergency room in a heartbeat, is a primary cancer treatment
      option of the safest and most effective kind.<br>
      <br>
      Studies have shown that dietary measures to boost bicarbonate
      levels can increase the pH of acidic tumors without upsetting the
      pH of the blood and healthy tissues. Animal models of human breast
      cancer show that oral sodium bicarbonate does indeed make tumors
      more alkaline and inhibit metastasis. Based on these studies, plus
      the fact that baking soda is safe and well tolerated, world
      renowned doctors such as Dr. Julian Whitaker have adopted
      successful cancer treatment protocols as part of an overall
      nutritional and immune support program for patients who are
      dealing with the disease. The Whitaker protocol uses 12 g (2
      rounded teaspoons) of baking soda mixed in 2 cups water, along
      with a low-cal sweetener of your choice. (It’s quite salty
      tasting.) Sip this mixture over the course of an hour or two and
      repeat for a total of three times a day. One man claims he has
      found a cure for cancer using baking soda and molasses and
      actually successfully treated his own disease by using baking
      soda.<br>
      <br>
      When taken orally with water, especially water with high magnesium
      content, and when used transdermally in medicinal baths, sodium
      bicarbonate becomes a first-line medicinal for the treatment of
      cancer, and also kidney disease, diabetes, influenza and even the
      common cold. It is also a powerful buffer against radiation
      exposure, so everyone should be up to speed on its use.
      Everybody’s physiology is under heavy nuclear attack from strong
      radioactive winds that are circling the northern hemisphere.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Robert J. Gillies and his colleagues have already demonstrated
      that pre-treatment of mice with baking soda results in the
      alkalinization of the area around tumors. The same researchers
      reported that bicarbonate increases tumor pH and also inhibits
      spontaneous metastases in mice with breast cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is Baking Soda?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Baking soda is a white crystalline solid that appears as fine
      powder. It is also called cooking soda, bread soda and bicarbonate
      of soda. Its chemical name is sodium bicarbonate or sodium
      hydrogen carbonate.<br>
      <br>
      Baking soda is different from washing soda (sodium carbonate)
      although they share the same slightly salty and alkaline taste.<br>
      <br>
      This widely used soda is commonly dissolved in mineral water and
      used as a leavening agent in baking. It works as a leavening agent
      by neutralizing the acidic components of batter. The
      neutralization releases carbon dioxide and leads to the “raising”
      or expansion of baked foods.<br>
      <br>
      Baking soda has also been used to soften vegetable and to
      tenderize meat.<br>
      <br>
      As a household chemical, baking soda is used as a cleaning agent.
      It is included in toothpastes for similar reasons where it serves
      as an antiseptic, acid-neutralizer, whitening agent and
      plaque-removing agent as well as a cleaning agent.<br>
      <br>
      Other common personal hygiene products in which baking soda can be
      found include deodorants and shampoos.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Baking Soda and pH Medicine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The pH of our tissues and body fluids is crucial and central
      because it affects and mirrors the state of our health or our
      inner cleanliness. The closer the pH is to 7.35-7.45, the higher
      our level of health and wellbeing. Staying within this range
      dramatically increases our ability to resist acute illnesses like
      colds and flues as well as the onset of cancer and other diseases.
      Keeping our pH within a healthy range also involves necessary
      lifestyle and dietary changes that will protect us over the long
      term while the use of sodium bicarbonate gives us a jump-start
      toward increased alkalinity.<br>
      <br>
      The pH scale is like a thermometer showing increases and decreases
      in the acid and alkaline content of fluids. Deviations above or
      below a 7.35-7.45 pH range in the tightly controlled blood can
      signal potentially serious and dangerous symptoms or states of
      disease. When the body can no longer effectively neutralize and
      eliminate the acids, it relocates them within the body’s
      extra-cellular fluids and connective tissue cells directly
      compromising cellular integrity. Conversely when the body becomes
      too alkaline from too much bicarbonate in the blood, metabolic
      alkalosis occurs, which can lead to severe consequences if not
      corrected quickly.<br>
      <br>
      Jon Barron presents a way of looking at pH that opens up one of
      the major benefits of alkaline water:<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen ions tie up oxygen. That means that the more acid a
      liquid is, the less available the oxygen in it. Every cell in our
      body requires oxygen for life and to maintain optimum health.
      Combine that with what we know about hydrogen ions and we see that
      the more acid the blood (the lower its pH), the less oxygen is
      available for use by the cells. Without going into a discussion of
      the chemistry involved, just understand that it’s the same
      mechanism involved when acid rain “kills” a lake. The fish
      literally suffocate to death because the acid in the lake “binds
      up” all of the available oxygen. It’s not that the oxygen has gone
      anywhere; it’s just no longer available. Conversely, if you raise
      the pH of the lake (make it more alkaline), oxygen is now
      available and the lake comes back to life. Incidentally, it’s
      worth noting that cancer is related to an acid environment (lack
      of oxygen)–the higher the pH (the more oxygen present in the cells
      of the body), the harder it is for cancer to thrive.<br>
      <br>
      Understanding this is important for two reasons: (1) it reveals
      one of the primary benefits of alkaline water–more “available”
      oxygen in the system and (2) it explains why alkaline water helps
      fight cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Baking Soda Can Help “Cure” Cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Basically, malignant tumors represent masses of rapidly growing
      cells. The rapid rate of growth experienced by these cells means
      that cellular metabolism also proceeds at very high rates.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, cancer cells are using a lot more carbohydrates and
      sugars to generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine
      triphosphate).<br>
      <br>
      However, some of the compounds formed from the energy production
      include lactic acid and pyruvic acid. Under normal circumstances,
      these compounds are cleared and utilized as soon as they are
      produced. But cancer cells are experiencing metabolism at a much
      faster rate. Therefore, these organic acid accumulate in the
      immediate environment of the tumor.<br>
      <br>
      The high level of extracellular acidity around the tumor is one of
      the chief driving force behind the metastasis of cancer tumors.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, cancer cells need an acidic environment to grow and
      spread rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      Some cancer experts, therefore, believe that by buffering the
      tumor microenvironment with an alkalizing compound, the pH of
      tumors can be raised enough to starve them and stop their growth
      and spread.<br>
      <br>
      Curiously, this rather simple solution to cancer has been proven
      right.<br>
      <br>
      What is even more remarkable is that there is no need to cook up
      some fancy synthetic drug to lower the acidity in the immediate
      environment of the tumor. A simple, commonly obtained compound
      like sodium bicarbonate will do.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, it is desirable to deliver the sodium bicarbonate as
      close to the tumor as possible since its pH-raising effect is
      needed in the microenvironment of the tumor. Therefore, directly
      injecting sodium bicarbonate in the tumor site is considered a
      better solution than oral administration. However, oral sodium
      bicarbonate is just safer and can be readily used at home.<br>
      <br>
      A 2009 study published in the journal, Cancer Research, is among
      the first to confirm that the alkalinizing effect of sodium
      bicarbonate can indeed stop cancer.<br>
      <br>
      By injecting sodium bicarbonate into a group of mice, the authors
      of the study were able to determine how the growth and spread of
      cancer tumors were effected by raising the pH of the organ
      affected by the cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The study results showed that baking soda indeed raised the pH and
      reduced spontaneous metastases in mice induced with breast cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also determined that sodium bicarbonate works by
      raising the pH outside cells and not within cells. This is an
      important finding because it suggests that sodium bicarbonate does
      not interfere with cellular metabolism even as it makes the
      microenvironment unconducive for tumor growth.<br>
      <br>
      Other findings from this study show that baking soda:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced the involvement of the lymph node on
      the transport of cancer cells<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does not lower the levels of circulating tumor
      cells<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced the involvement of the liver and,
      therefore, the spread of tumor cells to other organs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhibit the colonization of other organs by
      circulating tumor cells<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Baking Soda Formula for Cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To make the baking soda natural cancer remedy at home, you need
      maple syrup, molasses or honey to go along with the baking soda.<br>
      <br>
      In Dr. Sircus’ book, he documented how one patient used baking
      soda and blackstrap molasses to fight the prostate cancer that had
      metastasized to his bones. On the first day, the patient mixed 1
      teaspoon of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of molasses in a cup of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      He took this for another 3 days after which his saliva pH read 7.0
      and his urine pH read 7.5.<br>
      <br>
      Encouraged by these results, the patient took the solution 2 times
      on day 5 instead of once daily. And from day 6 – 10, he took 2
      teaspoons each of baking soda and molasses twice daily.<br>
      <br>
      By the 10th day, the patient’s pH had risen to 8.5 and the only
      side effects experienced were headaches and night sweat (similar
      to cesium therapy).<br>
      <br>
      The next day, the patient had a bone scan and too other medical
      tests. His results showed that his PSA (prostate-specific antigen,
      the protein used to determine the severity of prostate enlargement
      and prostate cancer) level was down from 22.3 at the point of
      diagnosis to 0.1.<br>
      <br>
      Another baking soda formula recommends mixing 90 teaspoons of
      maple syrup with 30 teaspoons of baking soda.<br>
      <br>
      To do this, the maple syrup must be heated to become less viscous.
      Then the baking syrup is added and stirred for 5 minutes until it
      is fully dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      This preparation should provide about 10-day worth of the baking
      soda remedy. 5 – 7 teaspoons per day is the recommended dose for
      cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      Care should be taken when using the baking soda remedy to treat
      cancer. This is because sustaining a high pH level can itself
      cause metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalance. These can
      result in edema and also affect the heart and blood pressure.<br>
      <br>
      One does not have to be a doctor to practice pH medicine. Every
      practitioner of the healing arts and every mother and father needs
      to understand how to use sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate
      deficiency is a real problem that deepens with age so it really
      does pay to understand and appreciate what baking soda is all
      about.<br>

      University of Arizona Cancer Center member Mark “Marty” Pagel,
      PhD, will receive a $2 million grant from the National Institutes
      of Health to study the effectiveness of personalized baking soda
      therapy to treat breast cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The grant will be used to help refine a new magnetic resonance
      imaging method for measuring pH, or acid content, of a tumor that
      has been discovered in a patient but not yet treated. By measuring
      the acid content of the tumor, doctors can monitor the
      effectiveness of personalized treatments such as baking soda on
      both tumors and healthy tissue, and even predict the effectiveness
      of chemotherapies before the patient starts the medication.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pagel, a member of the UACC’s Cancer Imaging program and an
      associate professor of biomedical engineering, has worked
      extensively on this research, collaborating with Ian Robey,
      assistant professor of research at the UACC, and clinical
      collaborators Alison Stopeck, MD, Setsuko Chambers, MD, and Phil
      Kuo, MD, PhD.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Pagel credits the Community Foundation of Southern Arizona and
      the Phoenix Friends of the Arizona Cancer Center with the generous
      gifts that allowed him and his team to lay the groundwork for the
      research that led to the NIH grant<br>

      One man claims he has found a cure for cancer and actually
      successfully treated his own by using baking soda.<br>
      <br>
      Vernon Johnston was diagnosed with stage IV aggressive prostate
      cancer which metastasized to his bones. He initially turned to
      Cesium, but ended up using a baking soda molasses protocol as a
      natural cure which eliminated his cancer and has worked for
      hundreds of others.<br>
      <br>
      Johnston says "it is very important for those of us who have done
      or are doing this [baking soda cancer cure] that we focus on an
      Alkaline Diet. At the very least, for those of us who are
      recovering I suggest a diet of at least 80% Alkaline and 20%
      Acidic..."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Protocol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1) Buy Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda OR Bob's Red Mill Aluminum
      Free Baking Soda. (Arm &amp; Hammer is supposedly aluminum free
      also.&nbsp; Arm &amp; Hammer was used in this protocol.)<br>
      <br>
      2) Buy Black Strap molasses OR Organic Maple syrup, Grade B.<br>
      <br>
      3) Buy pH test strips; strips don't run and are easy to use.&nbsp;
      Litmus paper may also be used along with the strips. <br>
      <br>
      4) Buy a good brand of potassium.<br>
      <br>
      5) Mix 1 teaspoon baking soda &amp; 1 teaspoon molasses/syrup in 1
      cup water.<br>
      <br>
      (May be warmed in a pan for dissolving, but this isn't required;
      room temperature is fine.&nbsp; If you heat it, heat on low.&nbsp;
      Heat the water and baking soda together, turn off heat, and then
      add the molasses or syrup. Don't use a microwave!)<br>
      <br>
      6) Drink this solution once a day for 5 days. <br>
      <br>
      (Always drink the solution 2 hours before or after a meal.)<br>
      <br>
      7) Test your pH often; both your saliva and your urine.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      (The pH must be brought to the normal/alkaline level which is 7.2
      - 7.5.&nbsp; This level should cause cancer cells to go dormant;
      and a level of 8.0 - 8.5 should kill them; and so it is advisable
      to bring your pH level to 8.0 - 8.5 for 4 to 5 days ONLY, and then
      lower again to normal.)<br>
      <br>
      8) On day 6, mix 2 teaspoons baking soda &amp; 2 teaspoons
      molasses/syrup in 1 cup water; drink twice a day.&nbsp; Continue
      this formula through day 7.<br>
      <br>
      (You may begin to feel a little nauseous or queasy, and your stool
      may become yellowish.&nbsp; This is expected. Something good is
      happening in your body - something bad to the cancer.&nbsp; Also,
      your lips may tingle and you may get Oxygen Euphoria and even a
      slight headache.&nbsp; This is expected and may eventually
      lessen.)<br>
      <br>
      9) On day 8, drink the mixture 3 times a day through day 11.<br>
      <br>
      (You may get some diarrhea and feel a little weak.&nbsp; This is
      expected.&nbsp; But taking potassium daily while on this BAKING
      SODA CURE should lessen your loss of energy.&nbsp; You should take
      a high dosage of potassium daily with this cure.&nbsp; On day 9 or
      10 of this dosage, you may get night sweats.&nbsp; This is
      expected.&nbsp; What you are doing right now is getting your pH to
      8.0 - 8.5 and (more or less) holding that for a few days.&nbsp; If
      you feel the side effects are too strong, you may always go back
      to taking the mixture twice a day, and when the symptoms lessen,
      go back to 3 times a day.&nbsp; Experimentation is fine - listen
      to your body; it will tell you when to back off.)<br>
      <br>
      10) On day 12, if you believe you're cured, you can stop taking
      the BAKING SODA CURE.&nbsp; But if you think you ever need a
      "tune-up" for cancer at any time, repeat all the above
      steps.&nbsp; If you're cancer free, it is advisable to use 2
      teaspoons baking soda and only one teaspoon molasses/syrup in 1
      cup of water once or twice daily for 7 days: i.e., if you're only
      trying to raise your pH to the alkaline range of 7.2 - 7.5. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The external pH of solid tumors is acidic as a consequence of
      increased metabolism of glucose and poor perfusion. Acid pH has
      been shown to stimulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis in
      vitro and in cells before tail vein injection in vivo. The present
      study investigates whether inhibition of this tumor acidity will
      reduce the incidence of in vivo metastases. Here, we show that
      oral NaHCO(3) selectively increased the pH of tumors and reduced
      the formation of spontaneous metastases in mouse models of
      metastatic breast cancer. This treatment regimen was shown to
      significantly increase the extracellular pH, but not the
      intracellular pH, of tumors by (31)P magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy and the export of acid from growing tumors by
      fluorescence microscopy of tumors grown in window chambers.
      NaHCO(3) therapy also reduced the rate of lymph node involvement,
      yet did not affect the levels of circulating tumor cells,
      suggesting that reduced organ metastases were not due to increased
      intravasation. In contrast, NaHCO(3) therapy significantly reduced
      the formation of hepatic metastases following intrasplenic
      injection, suggesting that it did inhibit extravasation and
      colonization. In tail vein injections of alternative cancer
      models, bicarbonate had mixed results, inhibiting the formation of
      metastases from PC3M prostate cancer cells, but not those of B16
      melanoma. Although the mechanism of this therapy is not known with
      certainty, low pH was shown to increase the release of active
      cathepsin B, an important matrix remodeling protease.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>BACKGROUND:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The glycolytic nature of malignant tumors contributes to high
      levels of extracellular acidity in the tumor microenvironment.
      Tumor acidity is a driving force in invasion and metastases.
      Recently, it has been shown that buffering of extracellular
      acidity through systemic administration of oral bicarbonate can
      inhibit the spread of metastases in a mouse model for metastatic
      breast cancer. While these findings are compelling, recent
      assessments into the use of oral bicarbonate as a cancer
      intervention reveal limitations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We posited that safety and efficacy of bicarbonate could be
      enhanced by dichloroacetate (DCA), a drug that selectively targets
      tumor cells and reduces extracellular acidity through inhibition
      of glycolysis. Using our mouse model for metastatic breast cancer
      (MDA-MB-231), we designed an interventional survival study where
      tumor bearing mice received bicarbonate, DCA, or DCA-bicarbonate
      (DB) therapies chronically.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dichloroacetate alone or in combination with bicarbonate did not
      increase systemic alkalosis in mice. Survival was longest in mice
      administered bicarbonate-based therapies. Primary tumor
      re-occurrence after surgeries is associated with survival rates.
      Although DB therapy did not significantly enhance oral
      bicarbonate, we did observe reduced pulmonary lesion diameters in
      this cohort. The DCA monotherapy was not effective in reducing
      tumor size or metastases or improving survival time. We provide in
      vitro evidence to suggest this outcome may be a function of
      hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      DB combination therapy did not appear to enhance the effect of
      chronic oral bicarbonate. The anti-tumor effect of DCA may be
      dependent on the cancer model. Our studies suggest DCA efficacy is
      unpredictable as a cancer therapy and further studies are
      necessary to determine the role of this agent in the tumor
      microenvironment.<br>

            Stage IV Protocol</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Webster Kehr</b><br>
        <b>Independent Cancer Research Foundation, Inc</b></div>
      <b>.<br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When dealing with cancer, someone in the family should be
      designated as the “cancer guru” in the family. This person should
      become an expert in the main protocol!!! For example, they should
      study this article, and the articles it links to, several times to
      make sure they understand this protocol.<br>
      <br>
      For example, I have received many emails from people who describe
      the cancer protocol they are using. In some cases, they will only
      be using the Dirt Cheap Protocol, and they will only be using 3 or
      4 of these items!! Someone didn’t do their homework! I can’t tell
      you how many times I have seen this!!<br>
      <br>
      If this is the main protocol a cancer patients uses, the person
      should use 14 or more of the items in this protocol EVERY DAY, not
      one or two or even six. However, they should only use one of the
      highly alkaline protocols per day.<br>
      <br>
      Also, cancer patients new to the CancerTutor website should first
      look at the left side-bar in the section on “Types of Cancer.” The
      article for the type of cancer the patient is dealing with will
      mention the recommended protocol to use for that type of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Almost all of the “Type of Cancer” articles will recommend one of
      the three major protocols: the Cellect-Budwig protocol, the Cesium
      Chloride protocol (i.e. the Alkaline protocol) or the Photon
      Protocol.<br>
      <br>
      This Dirt Cheap Protocol should not be a substitute for any of the
      three major protocols just mentioned unless the cancer patient
      cannot afford the recommended protocol. The exception is the
      Photon Protocol in which the Dirt Cheap Protocol is included
      because of synergy.<br>
      <br>
      The Photon Protocol is effectively the Dirt Cheap Protocol with a
      custom liver flush or generic liver flush (to kill the microbes
      and parasites in the organs to allow the immune system to recover
      much quicker) and a Photon device to energize the cells which were
      weakened by the microbes and parasites in the organs (which is the
      second half of this immune building technique).<br>
      <br>
      Also, this protocol is based on solid cancer theory. After each
      item there is a section called: “How This Treatment Works” which
      explains how each protocol helps the cancer patient deal with
      their cancer. Several of its component parts have cured cancer by
      themselves!!<br>
      <br>
      Fighting cancer is like fighting a fire!! You need enough fire
      trucks which are working together. Just like any fire is trying to
      spread, cancer is usually trying to spread!! Just like a fire
      department has to bring enough fire trucks, a cancer patient needs
      to have enough cancer treatments that work together.<br>
      <br>
      When using this protocol as the main cancer treatment, use at
      least 14 of the items in this protocol EVERY DAY, including the
      Kelmun!!<br>
      <br>
      Let me repeat that to make sure you understand!!!!<br>
      <br>
      When using this protocol as the main cancer treatment, use at
      least 14 of the items in this protocol EVERY DAY, including the
      Kelmun (if that is the alkaline protocol)!!<br>
      <br>
      Also, for very advanced cancer patients, sometimes one of the
      three major cancer treatments just mentioned is combined with the
      Dirt Cheap Protocol. However, when doing this there are two rules
      that must be followed:<br>
      <br>
      First, only ONE of the highly alkaline protocols should be used
      per day. This generally means that the Kelmun Protocol, Stevia and
      asparagus should NOT be used on the same day. Only one of these
      items per day.<br>
      <br>
      Second, if the main protocol uses the Budwig protocol, none of the
      elements of the Dirt Cheap Protocol should be used within 3 hours
      of the Budwig protocol, on both sides of the Budwig. This is
      because the Budwig is sensitive to anti-oxidants and most of the
      elements of the Dirt Cheap Protocol are anti-oxidants. But the 3
      hour gap will eliminate any conflicts.<br>
      <br>
      “Secret Product” is likely the single best treatment mentioned on
      this page. It should be combined with MSM/LIPH and MSM/Vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      Let me say it again: every cancer patient on the Dirt Cheap
      Protocol, if they can afford it, should use the “Secret Product”
      (2 pills a day) and either the MSM/LIPH and MSM/Vitamin C protocol
      (see the left side-bar under “Supplemental Treatments”).<br>
      <br>
      However, the person who supports the Cellect-Budwig protocol does
      not want anyone using any other treatments (including anything
      from the Dirt Cheap Protocol). So do not add things to the
      Cellect-Budwig protocol from this article.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Vitamin D or Vitamin D3 should be taken by every
      human being, with or without cancer, as it is critical for many
      biochemical reactions in the body. For cancer, D3 should be
      combined with MSM because it also kill microbes and the MSM will
      help the D3 get inside the cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      WARNING #1: There is a special article on this website which has
      some significant warnings and a lot of good, high level advice.
      The article is called the “first email” article. If there is
      redundancy then it is a really important item!! Here is a link to
      it:<br>
      First Email Article (Must Read)<br>
      <br>
      WARNING #2: Pregnant women should only use half of the regular
      dose of the Kelmun. Everything else can be used in full doses. You
      don’t want the baby to have too high levels of alkalinity.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the components in this protocol it is rated as a “Stage
      IV Protocol”, the highest rating!!<br>

      <br>
      Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) commonly called baking soda is a
      natural substance used in the human body within the bloodstream to
      regulate pH as a counterbalance to acid build up, which is
      critical to life. It affects the pH of cells and tissues, balances
      cell voltage, and increases CO2 which helps with oxygenation.
      Sodium Bicarbonate is a powerful medical tool that everyone would
      benefit by knowing more about.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium Bicarbonate can be used as a first line of defence for a
      vast range of sickness including, cancer, flu, diabetes, kidney
      disease and even the common cold. Sodium Bicarbonate can be used
      in many forms whether transdermally in a bath, orally or nebulised
      for lung conditions. It is so powerful in it's ability to detox
      that it can even be used against radiation exposure.<br>

      <br>
      This is the first medical review of sodium bicarbonate in the
      history of medicine and it will change the way we think about
      baking soda, change the way we practice medicine and change the
      way we take care of our children. Our lives are made easier by
      sodium bicarbonate and that easing of the way extends to health
      and medical care and can even save our lives if we have cardiac,
      cancer or kidney disease.<br>
      <br>
      Today, June 2, the Sodium Bicarbonate book, is available in the
      often requested hard copy version, is now on sale on Amazon and I
      invite all my readers to purchase a copy so we can push the book
      onto the bestseller list. Clearly, this is a great addition to
      everyone’s library and makes a wonderful gift because it brings
      people into awareness of a substance that can ease their aches and
      pains and even save lives like it does routinely in the emergency
      and intensive care wards.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium bicarbonate (Baking Soda) helps to save countless lives
      every day.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Boris Veysman specialist in emergency medicine at the Robert
      Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey describes one
      emergency room experience:<br>
      <br>
      “The emergency department is always noisy, but today the triage
      nurse is yelling "not breathing," as she runs toward us pushing a
      wheelchair.&nbsp; A pale, thin woman is slumped over and looking
      gray. Without concrete proof of a "Do Not Resuscitate" order,
      there’s no hesitation. Click, klang, and the patient has a tube
      down her throat within seconds. I do the chest compressions. On
      the monitor, she is flat-lining — no heartbeat. I synchronize my
      words with the compressions and call out for an external
      pacemaker. Pumping … thinking: Cardiac standstill … after walking
      in … with cancer … on chemo. This resuscitation isn’t by the book.
      "Get two amps of bicarbonate," I say to the intern. The jugular
      line takes seconds, and I flush it with sodium bicarbonate. This
      probably will correct the blood’s extreme acidity, which I suspect
      is driving up the potassium. The external pacemaker finally
      arrives. Potent electric shocks at 80 beats per minute begin to
      stimulate her heart. The vitals stabilize.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium bicarbonate is an emergency room intensive care medicine
      that can be used in cancer treatment as well as in fighting the
      symptoms of the flu. It is not a substitute for dietary
      corrections that leads one eventually into a healthy alkaline
      existence but it can be used quite effectively to change the
      terrain of tissues and cells quickly.<br>
      <br>
      I start this landmark medical book with the words above. We are
      talking about serious medicine when we talk about sodium
      bicarbonate. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) lives up to the
      image on the Arm and Hammer’s box, it is the ultimate heavy-weight
      workhorse medicine that every healthcare professional and parent
      should be knowledgeable about and routinely use.<br>
      <br>
      Everyone should know how to wield the mighty muscle (the famous
      Arm and Hammer logo is the appropriate image for sodium
      bicarbonate) of baking soda; knowing intimately its power and
      flexibility of application. Like magnesium chloride administration
      possibilities are versatile: intravenous, oral, transdermal, in
      lotions and baths, via catheter; it can also be vaporized directly
      into the lungs and be used in enemas and douches.<br>
      <br>
      Bicarbonate is present in all body fluids and organs and plays a
      major role in the acid-base balances in the human body.
      Bicarbonate deficiencies spell big trouble for human physiology
      when the vascular system begins to deteriorate as less oxygen is
      delivered to the cells. Bicarbonate deficiency is synonymous with
      carbon dioxide deficiencies, which occur in everyone who does not
      exercise properly. Bicarbonate is the wonderful medicine it is
      because it turns into carbon dioxide in the stomach, which drives
      bicarbonates into the blood.<br>
      <br>
      One of the greatest secrets in medicine is that bicarbonate and
      carbon dioxide are really two forms of the same thing and change
      into each other at the speed of light in the blood. One of the
      greatest tragedies of our time is brewing around the insanity of
      governments and their paid scientists and health officials, who
      are scaring the wits out of everyone with fear of carbon dioxide
      and the taxes they want to place on its production.<br>
      <br>
      Plants love carbon dioxide; we love carbon dioxide (it’s what
      makes exercise so healthy) but others hate it because they can
      sell their souls and make money by deceiving everyone about it.
      The real danger coming out of the coal stacks of the world is not
      the carbon dioxide but the huge tonnage of mercury that is
      released into the air each day, which I calculate to be about 20
      tons.<br>
      <br>
      Learn a system of medicine that is safe, simple and affordable.<br>
      <br>
      They have never proven that it is the carbon dioxide that is
      driving global warming and in fact we also have cooling from solar
      dimming, solar radiance decreasing, and increased volcanic
      activity, which can have heating effects on the planet from below
      and cooling effects from above as tremendous amounts of ash gets
      thrown high into the air.<br>
      <br>
      Baking soda is an essential medicine and is probably one of the
      most useful substances in the world. No wonder the pharmaceutical
      companies do not want doctors or anyone else to know much about
      it! Sodium Bicarbonate is an important medicine – of the safest –
      and it is essential when treating cancer, kidney and other
      diseases.<br>
