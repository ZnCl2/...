        Abstract ---&nbsp; A method for producing gold nanoparticles is
        disclosed. When gold salt solution is mixed with an absorbent,
        gold in the form of complexes is adsorbed onto the surface of
        the absorbent. The gold-loaded absorbent, after being separated
        from the solution by screening, filtration, settling or other
        methods, is ashed to form ashes. The ashes contain gold
        nanoparticles and impurities such as oxides of sodium, potassium
        and calcium. The impurities can be removed by dissolution using
        dilute acids. The relatively pure gold nanoparticles are
        obtained after the impurities are removed. Activated carbon or
        gold-adsorbing resin can be used as the absorbent. Silver or
        platinum group metal nanoparticles can also be produced by this
        method. </p>

        nanosilver, a method of manufacturing nanosilver-coated
        antibacterial fiber, and antibacterial fiber manufactured
        thereby. Nanosilver having a size of 5 nm or less can be
        produced on a mass scale by applying an electric field of 10,000
        to 300,000 volts (DC) across two Ag electrode plates equipped in
        a water electrolysis system and allowing only a microcurrent to
        flow between the electrode plates. The nanosilver-coated,
        antibacterial fiber is manufactured by applying a aqeous
        solution of the nanosilver to the surface of the synthetic
        fibers, adsorbing the nanosilver onto the cloth using a process
        selected from the group consisting of thermal fixation, high
        frequency radiation, bubbling, and combinations thereof; and
        conducting a post-finishing at 160 to 200 DEG C. And thus, an
        antibacterial fiber manufactured thereby may be a fundamental
        solution to the synthetic fiber's problems, that is, poor
        perspiration functionality and the generation of statistic
        electricity. </p>

        Abstract --- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a method of
        producing silver nanoparticles (average grain size 1 to 20 mm)
        for a silver paste having a good specific resistance of a
        hardening film at a high yield by a chemical reduction process.

        SOLUTION: More than stoichiometerically excessive ammonia water
        is added to an aqueous silver nitrate solution to form a silver
        complex and the silver nanoparticles are produced by reduction
        with an aqueous formalin solution at &gt;=0.90 in the ratio of
        the solvent and water at temperature 20 to 40[deg.]C in a methyl

        Abstract --- The invention provides new types of plasmon-driven
        growth mechanism for silver nanostructures involving the fusion
        of triangular nanoprisms. This mechanism, which is plasmon
        excitation-driven and highly cooperative, produces bimodal
        particle size distributions. In these methods, the growth
        process can be selectively switched between bimodal and unimodal
        distributions using dual beam illumination of the nanoparticles.
        This type of cooperative photo-control over nanostructure growth
        enables synthesis of monodisperse nanoprisms with a preselected
        edge length in the 30-120 nm range simply by using one beam to
        turn off bimodal growth and the other (varied over the 450-700
        nm range) for controlling particle size. </p>

        and to obtain a dispersed solution comprising the Ag
        nanoparticles. <br>
        SOLUTION: The Ag nanoparticles with a particle diameter of 1 to
        20 nm comprising the ammine complex of silver nitrate as a
        dispersing agent can be obtained by mixing silver nitrate, a
        reducing agent which does not show reducibility in an organic

        In this method, a solution of
        (Cu(C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;5&lt;/SUB&gt;,

or
(Au(C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;5
&lt;/SUB&gt;is








        dissolved in a coordinating solvent, such as a primary,
        secondary, or tertiary amine; primary, secondary, or tertiary
        phosphine, or alkyl thiol, to produce a mesityl precursor
        solution. This solution is subsequently injected into an organic
        solvent that is heated to a temperature greater than
        approximately 100 DEG C. After washing with an organic solvent,
        such as an alcohol (including methanol, ethanol, propanol, and
        higher molecular-weight alcohols), oxide free coinage NP are
        prepared that could be extracted with a solvent, such as an
        aromatic solvent (including, for example, toluene, benzene, and
        pyridine) or an alkane (including, for example, pentane, hexane,
        and heptane). Characterization by UV-Vis spectroscopy and
        transmission electron microscopy showed that the NPs were
        approximately 9.2+-2.3 nm in size for Cu DEG , (no surface oxide
        present), approximately 8.5+-1.1 nm Ag DEG spheres, and
        approximately 8-80 nm for Au DEG . </p>

        Abstract --- The invention is a novel photo-induced method for
        converting large quantities of silver nanospheres into
        nanoprisms, the nanoprisms formed by this method and
        applications in which the nanoprisms are useful. Significantly,
        this light driven process results in a colloid with a unique set
        of optical properties that directly relate to the nanoprism
        shape of the particles. Theoretical calculations coupled with
        experimental observations allow for the assignment of the
        nanoprism plasmon bands and the first identification of two
        distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances for a nanoparticle.
        Finally, unlike the spherical particles from which they derive
        and which Rayleigh light scatter in the blue, these nanoprisms
        exhibit scattering in the red, permitting multicolor diagnostic
        labels based not only on nanoparticle composition and size but
        also on shape. </p>

        SOLUTION: This manufacturing method comprises, when

        in a solvent, employing an insoluble salt of a silver halide
        (particularly silver chloride or silver bromide) for the silver

        presence of a protective agent consisting of a compound soluble
        in a solvent and having a ligating property to silver. A
        preferable protective agent is a thiol like thiocholine bromide.
        Then, a monodisperse liquid of the silver nanoparticles is
        obtained, which are dispersed in the solvent while being coated
        and protected by the protective, agent. </p>
