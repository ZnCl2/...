      And then many sick and maimed came to Jesus, asking him. "if you
      know all things, tell us, why do we suffer with these grievous
      plagues? Why are we not whole like other men? Master, heal us,
      that we too may be made strong, and need abide no longer in our
      misery. We know that you have it in your power to heal all manner
      of disease. Free us from Satan and from all his great afflictions.
      Master, have compassion on us."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered- "Happy are you that you hunger for the truth,
      for I will satisfy you with the bread of wisdom. Happy are you,
      that you knock, for I will open to you the door of life. Happy are
      you, that you would cast off the power of Satan, for I will lead
      you into the kingdom of our Mother's angels, where the power of
      Satan cannot enter."<br>
      <br>
      And they asked him in amazement: "Who is our Mother and which her
      angels? And where is her kingdom?"<br>
      <br>
      "Your Mother is in you, and you in her. She bore you she gives you
      life. It was she who gave to you your body, and to her shall you
      one day give it back again. Happy are you when you come to know
      her and her kingdom; if you receive your Mother's angels and if
      you do her laws. I tell you truly, he who does these things shall
      never see disease. For the power of our Mother is above all. And
      it destroys Satan and his kingdom, and has rule over all your
      bodies and all living things.<br>
      <br>
      "The blood which runs in us is born of the blood of our Earthly
      Mother. Her blood falls from the clouds; leaps from the womb of
      the earth; babbles in the brooks of the mountains; flows wide in
      the rivers of the plains; sleeps in the lakes; rages mightily in
      tempestuous seas.<br>
      <br>
      "The air which we breathe is born of the breath of our Earthly
      Mother. Her breath is azure in the heights of the heavens; soughs
      in the tops of the mountains; whispers the leaves of the forest;
      billows over the cornfields; slumbers in the deep valleys, burns
      hot in the desert.<br>
      <br>
      "The hardness of our bones is born of the bones of our Earthly
      Mother, of the rocks and of the stones. They stand naked to the
      heavens on the tops of mountains; are as giants that lie sleeping
      on the sides of the mountains, as idols set in the desert, and are
      hidden in the deepness of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      "The tenderness of our flesh is born of the flesh of our Earthly
      Mother; whose flesh waxes yellow and red in the fruits of the
      trees, and nurtures us in the furrows of the fields.<br>
      <br>
      "Our bowels are born of the bowels of our Earthly Mother, and are
      hid from our eyes, like the invisible depths of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      "The light of our eyes, the hearing of our ears, both are born of
      the colors and the sounds of our Earthly Mother; which enclose us
      about, as the waves of the sea a fish, as the eddying air a bird.<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you in very truth, Man is the Son of the Earthly Mother,
      and from her did the Son of Man receive his whole body, even as
      the body of the newborn babe is born of the womb of his mother. I
      tell you truly, you are one with the Earthly Mother; she is in
      you, and you in her. Of her were you born, in her do you live, and
      to her shall you return again. Keep, therefore, her laws, for none
      can live long, neither be happy, but he who honors his Earthly
      Mother and does her laws. For your breath is her breath; your
      blood her blood; your bone her bone; your flesh her flesh; your
      bowels her bowels; your eyes and your ears are her eyes and her
      ears.<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you truly, should you fail to keep but one only of all
      these laws, should you harm but one only of all your body's
      members, you shall be utterly lost in your grievous sickness, and
      there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I tell you, unless
      you follow the laws of your Mother, you can in no wise escape
      death. And he who clings to the laws of his Mother, to him shall
      his Mother cling also. She shall heal all his plagues, and he
      shall never become sick. She gives him long life, and protects him
      from all afflictions; from fire, from water, from the bite of
      venomous serpents. For your Mother bore you, keeps life within
      you. She has given you her body, and none but she heals you. Happy
      is he who loves his Mother and lies quietly in her bosom. For your
      Mother loves you, even when you turn away from her. And how much
      more shall she love you, if you turn to her again? I tell you
      truly, very great is her love, greater than the greatest of
      mountains, deeper than the deepest seas. And those who love their
      Mother, she never deserts them. As the hen protects her chickens,
      as the lioness her cubs, as the mother her newborn babe, so does
      the Earthly Mother protect the Son of Man from all danger and from
      all evils.<br>
      <br>
      "For I tell you truly, evils and dangers innumerable lie in wait
      for the Sons of Men. Beelzebub, the prince of all devils, the
      source of every evil, lies in wait in the body of all the Sons of
      Men. He is death, the lord of every plague, and taking upon him a
      pleasing raiment, he tempts and entices the Sons of Men. Riches
      does he promise, and power, and splendid palaces, and garments of
      gold and silver, and a multitude of servants, all these; he
      promises renown and glory, fornication and lustfulness, gluttony
      and wine-bibbing, riotous living, and slothfulness and idle days.
      And he entices every one by that to which their heart is most
      inclined. And in the day that the Sons of Men have already become
      the slaves of all these vanities and abominations, then in payment
      thereof he snatches from the Sons of Men all those things which
      the Earthly Mother gave them so abundantly. He takes from them
      their breath, their blood, their bone, their flesh, their bowels,
      their eyes and their ears. And the breath of the Son of Man
      becomes short and stifled, full of pain and evil-smelling, like
      the breath of unclean beasts. And his blood becomes thick and
      evil-smelling, like the water of the swamps; it clots and
      blackens, like the night of death. And his bone becomes hard and
      knotted; it melts away within and breaks asunder, as a stone
      falling down upon a rock. And his flesh waxes fat and watery; it
      rots and putrefies, with scabs and boils that are an abomination.<br>
      <br>
      And his bowels become full with abominable filthiness, with oozing
      streams of decay; and multitudes of abominable worms have their
      habitation there. And his eyes grow dim, till dark night enshrouds
      them, and his ears become stopped, like the silence of the grave.
      And last of all shall the erring Son of Man lose life. For he kept
      not the laws of his Mother, and added sin to sin. Therefore, are
      taken from him all the gifts of the Earthly Mother: breath, blood,
      bone, flesh, bowels, eyes and ears, and after all else, life, with
      which the Earthly Mother crowned his body.<br>
      <br>
      "But if the erring Son of Man be sorry for his sins and undo them,
      and return again to his Earthly Mother; and if he do his Earthly
      Mother's laws and free himself from Satan's clutches, resisting
      his temptations, then does the Earthly Mother receive again her
      erring Son with love and sends him her angels that they may serve
      him. I tell you truly, when the Son of Man resists the Satan that
      dwells in him and does not his will, in the same hour are found
      the Mother's angels there, that they may serve him with all their
      power and free utterly the Son of Man from the power of Satan.<br>
      <br>
      "For no man can serve two masters. For either he serves Beelzebub
      and his devils or else he serves our Earthly Mother and her
      angels. Either he serves death or he serves life. I tell you
      truly, happy are those that do the laws of life and wander not
      upon the paths of death. For in them the forces of life wax strong
      and they escape the plagues of death."<br>
      And all those round about him listened to his words with
      amazement, for his word was with power, and he taught quite
      otherwise than the priests and scribes.<br>
      <br>
      And though the sun was now set, they departed not to their homes.
      They sat round about Jesus and asked him: "Master, which are these
      laws of life? Rest with us awhile longer and teach us. We would
      listen to your teaching that we may be healed and become
      righteous."<br>
      And Jesus himself sat down in their midst and said: "I tell you
      truly, none can be happy, except he do the Law."<br>
      <br>
      And the others answered: "We all do the laws of Moses, our
      lawgiver, even as they are written in the holy scriptures."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered: "Seek not the law in your scriptures, for the
      law is life, whereas the scripture is dead. I tell you truly,
      Moses received not his laws from<br>
      <br>
      God in writing, but through the living word. The law is living
      word of living God to living prophets for living men. In
      everything that is life is the law written. You find it in the
      grass, in the tree, in the river, in the mountain, in the birds of
      heaven, in the fishes of the sea; but seek it chiefly in
      yourselves. For I tell you truly, all living things are nearer to
      God than the scripture which is without life. God so made life and
      all living things that they might by the everlasting word teach
      the laws of the true God to man. God wrote not the laws in the
      pages of books, but in your heart and in your spirit. They are in
      your breath, your blood, your bone; in your flesh, your bowels,
      your eyes, your ears, and in every little part of your body. They
      are present in the air, in the water, in the earth, in the plants,
      in the sunbeams, in the depths and in the heights. They all speak
      to you that you may understand the tongue and the will of the
      living God. But you shut your eyes that you may not see, and you
      shut your ears that you may not hear. I tell you truly, that the
      scripture is the work of man, but life and all its hosts are the
      work of our God. Wherefore do you not listen to the words of God
      which are written in His works? And wherefore do you study the
      dead scriptures which are the work of the hands of men?"<br>
      <br>
      "How may we read the laws of God elsewhere than in the scriptures?
      Where are they written? Read them to us from there where you see
      them, for we know nothing else but the scriptures which we have
      inherited from our forefathers. Tell us the laws of which you
      speak, that hearing them we may be healed and justified."<br>
      <br>
      Jesus said: "You do not understand the words of life, because you
      are in death. Darkness darkens your eyes and your ears are stopped
      with deafness. For I tell you, it profits you not at all that you
      pore over dead scriptures if by your deeds you deny him who has
      given you the scriptures.<br>
      <br>
      I tell you truly, God and his laws are not in that which you do.
      They are not in gluttony and in wine-bibbing, neither in riotous
      living, nor in lustfulness, nor in seeking after riches, nor yet
      in hatred of your enemies. For all these things are far from the
      true God and from his angels. But all these things come from the
      kingdom of darkness and the lord of all evils. And all these
      things do you carry in yourselves; and so the word and the power
      of God enter not into you, because all manner of evil and all
      manner of abominations have their dwelling in your body and your
      spirit. If you will that the living God's word and his power may
      enter you, defile not your body and your spirit; for the body is
      the temple of the spirit, and the spirit is the temple of God.
      Purify, therefore, the temple, that the Lord of the temple may
      dwell therein and occupy a place that is worthy of him.<br>
      <br>
      "And from all temptations of your body and your spirit, coming
      from Satan, withdraw beneath the shadow of God's heaven.<br>
      <br>
      "Renew yourselves and fast. For I tell you truly, that Satan and
      his plagues may only be cast out by fasting and by prayer. Go by
      yourself and fast alone, and show your fasting to no man. The
      living God shall see it and great shall be your reward. And fast
      till Beelzebub and all his evils depart from you, and all the
      angels of our Earthly Mother come and serve you. For I tell you
      truly, except you fast, you shall never be freed from the power of
      Satan and from all diseases that come from Satan. Fast and pray
      fervently, seeking the power of the living God for your healing.
      While you fast, eschew the Sons of Men and seek our Earthly
      Mother's angels, for he that seeks shall find.<br>
      <br>
      "Seek the fresh air of the forest and of the fields, and there in
      the midst of them shall you find the angel of air. Put off your
      shoes and your clothing and suffer the angel of air to embrace all
      your body. Then breathe long and deeply, that the angel of air may
      be brought within you. I tell you truly, the angel of air shall
      cast out of your body all uncleannesses which defiled it without
      and within. And thus shall all evil-smelling and unclean things
      rise out of you, as the smoke of fire curls upwards and is lost in
      the sea of the air. For I tell you truly, holy is the angel of
      air, who cleanses all that is unclean and makes all evil-smelling
      things of a sweet odor. No man may come before the face of God,
      whom the angel of air lets not pass. Truly, all must be born again
      by air and by truth, for your body breathes the air of the Earthly
      Mother, and your spirit breathes the truth of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      "After the angel of air, seek the angel of water. Put off your
      shoes and your clothing and suffer the angel of water to embrace
      all your body. Cast yourselves wholly into his enfolding arms, and
      as often as you move the air with your breath, move with your body
      the water also. I tell you truly, the angel of water shall cast
      out of your body all uncleannesses which defiled it without and
      within. And all unclean and evil-smelling things shall flow out of
      you, even as the uncleannesses of garments washed in water flow
      away and are lost in the stream of the river. I tell you truly,
      holy is the angel of water who cleanses all that is unclean and
      makes all evil-smelling things of a sweet odor. No man may come
      before the face of God whom the angel of water lets not pass. in
      very truth, all must be born again of water and of truth, for your
      body bathes in the river of earthly life, and your spirit bathes
      in the river of life everlasting. For you receive<br>
      ￼your blood from our Earthly Mother and the truth from our
      Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      "Think not that it is sufficient that the angel of water embrace
      you outwards only. I tell you truly, the uncleanness within is
      greater by much than the uncleanness without. And he who cleanses
      himself without, but within remains unclean, is like to tombs that
      outwards are painted fair, but are within full of all manner of
      horrible uncleannesses and abominations. So I tell you truly,
      suffer the angel of water to baptize you also within, that you may
      become free from all your past sins, and that within likewise you
      may become as pure as the river's foam sporting in the sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      "Seek, therefore, a large trailing gourd, having a stalk the
      length of a man; take out its inwards and fill it with water from
      the river which the sun has warmed. Hang it upon the branch of a
      tree, and kneel upon the ground before the angel of water, and
      suffer the end of the stalk of the trailing gourd to enter your
      hinder parts, that the water may flow through all your bowels.
      Afterwards rest kneeling on the ground before the angel of water
      and pray to the living God that he will forgive you all your past
      sins, and pray the angel of water that he will free your body from
      every uncleanness and disease. Then let the water run out from
      your body, that it may carry away from within it all the unclean
      and evil-smelling things of Satan. And you shall see with your
      eyes and smell with your nose all the abominations, and
      uncleannesses which defiled the temple of your body; even all the
      sins which abode in your body, tormenting you with all manner of
      pains. I tell you truly, baptism with water frees you from all of
      these. Renew your baptizing with water on every day of your fast,
      till the day when you see that the water which flows out of you is
      as pure as the river's foam. Then betake your body to the coursing
      river, and there in the arms of the angel of water render thanks
      to the living God that he has freed you from your sins. And this
      holy baptizing by the angel of water is: Rebirth unto the new
      life. For your eyes shall henceforth see, and your ears shall
      hear. Sin no more, therefore, after your baptism, that the angels
      of air and of water may eternally abide in you and serve you
      evermore.<br>
      <br>
      "And if afterward there remain within you aught of your past sins
      and uncleannesses, seek the angel of sunlight. Put off your shoes
      and your clothing and suffer the angel of sunlight to embrace all
      your body. Then breathe long and deeply, that the angel of
      sunlight may be brought within you. And the angel of sunlight
      shall cast out of your body all evil-smelling and unclean things
      which defiled it without and within. And all unclean and
      evil-smelling things shall rise from you, even as the darkness of
      night fades before the brightness of the rising sun. For I tell
      you truly, holy is the angel of sunlight who cleans out all
      uncleannesses and makes all evil-smelling things of a sweet odor.
      None may come before the face of God, whom the angel of sunlight
      lets not pass. Truly, all must be born again of sun and of truth,
      for your body basks in the sunlight of the Earthly Mother, and
      your spirit basks in the sunlight of the truth of the Heavenly
      Father.<br>
      <br>
      "The angels of air and of water and of sunlight are brethren. They
      were given to the Son of Man that they might serve him, and that
      he might go always from one to the other.<br>
      <br>
      "Holy, likewise, is their embrace. They are indivisible children
      of the Earthly Mother, so do not you put asunder those whom earth
      and heaven have made one. Let these three brother angels enfold
      you every day and let them abide with you through all your
      fasting.<br>
      <br>
      "For I tell you truly, the power of devils, all sins and
      uncleannesses shall depart in haste from that body which is
      embraced by these three angels. As thieves flee from a deserted
      house at the coming of the lord of the house, one by the door, one
      by the window, and the third by the roof, each where he is found,
      and whither he is able, even so shall flee from your bodies all
      devils of evil, all past sins, and all uncleannesses and diseases
      which defiled the temple of your bodies. When the Earthly Mother's
      angels enter into your bodies, in such wise that the lords of the
      temple repossess it again, then shall all evil smells depart in
      haste by your breath and by your skin, corrupt waters by your
      mouth and by your skin, by your hinder and your privy parts. And
      all these things you shall see with your eyes and smell with your
      nose and touch with your hands. And when all sins and
      uncleannesses are gone from your body, your blood shall become as
      pure as our Earthly Mother's blood and as the river's foam
      sporting in the sunlight. And your breath shall become as pure as
      the breath of odorous flowers; your flesh as pure as the flesh of
      fruits reddening upon the leaves of trees; the light of your eye
      as clear and bright as the brightness of the sun shining upon the
      blue sky. And now shall all the angels of the Earthly Mother serve
      you. And your breath, your blood, your flesh shall be one with the
      breath, the blood and the flesh of the Earthly Mother, that your
      spirit also may become one with the spirit of your Heavenly
      Father. For truly, no one can reach the Heavenly Father unless
      through ￼the Earthly Mother. Even as no newborn babe can
      understand the teaching of his father till his mother has suckled
      him, bathed him, nursed him, put him to sleep and nurtured him.
      While the child is yet small, his place is with his mother and he
      must obey his mother. When the child is grown up, his father takes
      him to work at his side in the field, and the child comes back to
      his mother only when the hour of dinner and supper is come. And
      now his father teaches him, that he may become skilled in the
      works of his father. And when the father sees that his son
      understands his teaching and does his work well, he gives him all
      his possessions, that they may belong to his beloved son, and that
      his son may continue his father's work. I tell you truly, happy is
      that son who accepts the counsel of his mother and walks therein.
      And a hundred times more happy is that son who accepts and walks
      also in the counsel of his father, for it was said to you: 'Honor
      thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon this
      earth.' But I say to you, Sons of Man: Honor your Earthly Mother
      and keep all her laws, that your days may be long on this earth,
      and honor your Heavenly Father that Eternal Life may be yours in
      the heavens. For the Heavenly Father is a hundred times greater
      than all fathers by seed and by blood, and greater is the Earthly
      Mother than all mothers by the body. And dearer is the Son of Man
      in the eyes of his Heavenly Father and of his Earthly Mother than
      are children in the eyes of their fathers by seed and by blood and
      of their mothers by the body. And more wise are the words and laws
      of your Heavenly Father and of your Earthly Mother than the words
      and the will of all fathers by seed and by blood, and of all
      mothers by the body. And of more worth also is the inheritance of
      your Heavenly Father and of your Earthly Mother, the everlasting
      kingdom of earthly and heavenly life, than all the inheritances of
      your fathers by seed and by blood, and of your mothers by the
      body.<br>
      <br>
      "And your true brothers are all those who do the will of your
      Heavenly Father and of your Earthly Mother, and not your brothers
      by blood. I tell you truly, that your true brothers in the will of
      the Heavenly Father and of the Earthly Mother will love you a
      thousand times more than your brothers by blood. For since the
      days of Cain and Abel, when brothers by blood transgressed the
      will of God, there is no true brotherhood by blood. And brothers
      do unto brothers as do strangers. Therefore, I say to you, love
      your true brothers in the will of God a thousand times more than
      your brothers by blood.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      FOR YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS LOVE.<br>
      FOR YOUR EARTHLY MOTHER IS LOVE. FOR THE SON OF MAN IS LOVE.<br>
      <br>
      "It is by love, that the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother
      and the Son of Man become one. For the spirit of the Son of Man
      was created from the spirit of the Heaven Father, and his body
      from the body of the Earthly Mother. Become, therefore, perfect as
      the spirit of your Heavenly Father and the body of your Earthly
      Mother are perfect. And so love your Heavenly Father, as he loves
      your spirit. And so love your Earthly Mother, as she loves your
      body. And so love your true brothers, as your Heavenly Father and
      your Earthly Mother love them. And then your Heavenly Father shall
      give you his holy spirit, and your Earthly Mother shall give you
      her holy body. And then shall the Sons of Men like true brothers
      give love one to another, the love which they received from their
      Heavenly Father and from their Earthly Mother; and they shall all
      become comforters one of another. And then shall disappear from
      the earth all evil and all sorrow, and there shall be love and joy
      upon earth. And then shall the earth be like the heavens, and the
      kingdom of God shall come. And then shall come the Son of Man in
      all his glory, to inherit the kingdom of God. And then shall the
      Sons of Men divide their divine inheritance, the kingdom of God.
      For the Sons of Men live in the Heavenly Father and in the Earthly
      Mother, and the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother live in
      them. And then with the kingdom of God shall come the end of the
      times. For the Heavenly Father's love gives to all life
      everlasting in the kingdom of God. For love is eternal. Love is
      stronger than death.<br>
      <br>
      "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have
      not love, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
      Though I tell what is to come, and know all secrets, and all
      wisdom; and though I have faith strong as the storm which lifts
      mountains from their seat, but have not love, I am nothing. And
      though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give all my
      fire that I have received from my Father, but have not love, I am
      in no wise profited. Love is patient, love is kind. Love is not
      envious, works not evil, knows not pride; is not rude, neither
      selfish; is slow to anger, imagines no mischief; rejoices not in
      injustice, but delights in justice. Love defends all, love
      believes all, love hopes all, love bears all; never exhausts
      itself; but as for tongues they shall cease, and, as for
      knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we have truth in part, and
      error in part, but when the fullness of perfection is come, that
      which is in part shall be blotted out. When a man was a child he
      spoke as a child, understood as a child, thought as a child; but
      when he became a man he put away childish things. For now we see
      through a glass and through dark sayings. Now we know in part, but
      when we are come before the face of God, we shall not know in
      part, but even as we are taught by him. And now remain these
      three: faith and hope and love; but the greatest of these is love.<br>
      <br>
      "And now I speak to you in the living tongue of the living God,
      through the holy spirit of our Heavenly Father. There is none yet
      among you that can understand all this of which I speak. He who
      expounds to you the scriptures speaks to you in a dead tongue of
      dead men, through his diseased and mortal body. Him, therefore,
      can all men understand, for all men are diseased and all are in
      death. No one sees the light of life. Blind man leads blind on the
      dark paths of sins, diseases and sufferings; and at the last all
      fall into the pit of death.<br>
      <br>
      "I am sent to you by the Father, that I may make the light of life
      to shine before you. The light lightens itself and the darkness,
      but the darkness knows only itself, and knows not the light. I
      have still many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them
      yet. For your eyes are used to the darkness, and the full light of
      the Heavenly Father would make you blind. Therefore, you cannot
      yet understand that which I speak to you concerning the Heavenly
      Father who sent me to you. Follow, therefore, first, only the laws
      of your Earthly Mother, of which I have told you. And when her
      angels shall have cleansed and renewed your bodies and
      strengthened your eyes, you will be able to bear the light of our
      Heavenly Father. When you can gaze on the brightness of the
      noonday sun with unflinching eyes, you can then look upon the
      blinding light of your Heavenly Father, which is a thousand times
      brighter than the brightness of a thousand suns. But how should
      you look upon the blinding light of your Heavenly Father, when you
      cannot even bear the shining of the blazing sun? Believe me, the
      sun is as the flame of a candle beside the sun of truth of the
      Heavenly Father. Have but faith, therefore, and hope, and love. I
      tell you truly, you shall not want your reward. If you believe in
      my words, you believe in him who sent me, who is the lord of all,
      and with whom all things are possible. For what is impossible with
      men, all these things are possible with God. If you believe in the
      angels of the Earthly Mother and do her laws, your faith shall
      sustain you and you shall never see disease. Have hope also in the
      love of your Heavenly Father, for he who trusts in him shall never
      be deceived, nor shall he ever see death.<br>
      <br>
      "Love one another, for God is love, and so shall his angels know
      that you walk in his paths. And then shall all the angels come
      before your face and serve you. And Satan with all sins, diseases
      and uncleannesses shall depart from your body. Go, eschew your
      sins; repent yourselves; baptize yourselves; that you may be born
      again and sin no more."<br>
      <br>
      Then Jesus rose. But all else remained sitting, for every man felt
      the power of his words. And then the full moon appeared between
      the breaking clouds and folded Jesus in its brightness. And sparks
      flew upward from his hair, and he stood among them in the
      moonlight, as though he hovered in the air. And no man moved,
      neither was the voice of any heard. And no one knew how long a
      time had passed, for time stood still.<br>
      <br>
      Then Jesus stretched out his hands to them and said: "Peace be
      with you." And so he departed, as a breath of wind sways the green
      of trees.<br>
      <br>
      And for a long while yet the company sat still and then they woke
      in the silence, one man after another, like as from a long dream.
      But none would go, as if the words of him who had left them ever
      sounded in their ears. And they sat as though they listened to
      some wondrous music.<br>
      <br>
      But at last one, as it were a little fearfully, said: "How good it
      is to be here." Another: "Would that this night were everlasting."
      And others: "Would that he might be with us always." "Of a truth
      he is God's messenger, for he planted hope within our hearts." And
      no man wished to go home, saying: "I go not home where all is dark
      and joyless. Why should we go home where no one loves us?"<br>
      <br>
      And they spoke on this wise, for they were almost all poor, lame,
      blind, maimed, beggars, homeless, despised in their wretchedness,
      who were only borne for pity's sake in the houses where they found
      a few day's refuge. Even certain, who had both home and family,
      said: "We also will stay with you." For every man felt that the
      words of him who was gone bound the little company with threads
      invisible. And all felt that they were born again. They saw before
      them a shining world, even when the moon was hidden in the clouds.
      And in the hearts of all blossomed wondrous flowers of wondrous
      beauty, the flowers of joy.<br>
      <br>
      And when the bright sunbeams appeared over the earth's rim, they
      all felt that it was the sun of the coming kingdom of God. And
      with joyful countenances they went forth to meet God's angels.<br>
      <br>
      And many unclean and sick followed Jesus' words and sought the
      banks of the murmuring streams. They put off their shoes and their
      clothing, they fasted, and they gave up their bodies to the angels
      of air, of water, and of sunshine. And the Earthly Mother's angels
      embraced them, possessing their bodies both inwards and outwards.
      And all of them saw all evils, sins and uncleannesses depart in
      haste from them.<br>
      <br>
      And the breath of some became as stinking as that which is loosed
      from the bowels, and some had an issue of spittle, and
      evil-smelling and unclean vomit rose from their inward parts. All
      these uncleannesses flowed by their mouths. In some, by the nose,
      in others by the eyes and ears. And many did have a noisome and
      abominable sweat come from all their body, over all their skin.
      And on many limbs great hot boils broke forth, from which came out
      uncleannesses with an evil smell, and urine flowed abundantly from
      their body; and in many their urine was all but dried up and
      became thick as the honey of bees; that of others was almost red
      or black, and as hard almost as the sand of rivers. And many
      belched stinking gases from their bowels, like the breath of
      devils. And their stench became so great that none could bear it.<br>
      <br>
      And when they baptized themselves, the angel of water entered
      their bodies, and from them flowed out all the abominations and
      uncleannesses of their past sins, and like a falling mountain
      stream gushed from their bodies a multitude of hard and soft
      abominations. And the ground where their waters flowed was
      polluted, and so great became the stench that none could remain
      there. And the devils left their bowels in the shape of
      multitudinous worms which writhed in impotent rage after the angel
      of water had cast them out of the bowels of the Sons of Men. And
      then descended upon them the power of the angel of sunshine, and
      they perished there in their desperate writhings, trod underfoot
      by the angel of sunshine. And all were trembling with terror when
      they looked upon all these abominations of Satan, from which the
      angels had saved them. And they rendered thanks to God who had
      sent his angels for their deliverance.<br>
      <br>
      And there were some whom great pains tormented, which would not
      depart from them; and knowing not what they should do, they
      resolved to send one of them to Jesus, for they greatly wished he
      should be with them.<br>
      <br>
      And when two were gone to seek him, they saw Jesus himself
      approaching by the bank of the river. And their hearts were filled
      with hope and joy when they heard his greeting, "Peace be with
      you." And many were the questions that they desired to ask him,
      but in their astonishment they could not begin, for nothing came
      into their minds. Then said Jesus to them: "I come because you
      need me." And one cried out: "Master, we do indeed, come and free
      us from our pains."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus spoke to them in parables: "You are like the prodigal
      son, who for many years did eat and drink, and passed his days in
      riotousness and lechery with his friends. And every week without
      his father's knowledge he incurred new debts, and squandered all
      in a few days. And the moneylenders always lent to him, because
      his father possessed great riches and always paid patiently the
      debts of his son. And in vain did he with fair words admonish his
      son, for he never listened to the admonitions of his father, who
      besought him in vain that he would give up his debaucheries which
      had no end, and that he would go to his fields to watch over the
      labor of his servants. And the son always promised him everything
      if he would pay his old debts, but the next day he began again.
      And for more than seven years the son continued in his riotous
      living. But, at last, his father lost patience and no more paid to
      the moneylenders the debts of his son. "if I continue always to
      pay," he said, "there will be no end to the sins of my son." Then
      the moneylenders, who were deceived, in their wrath took the son
      into slavery that he might by his daily toil pay back to them the
      money which he had borrowed. And then ceased the eating and
      drinking and the daily excesses. From morning until night by the
      sweat of his face he watered the fields, and all of his limbs
      ached with the unaccustomed labor. And he lived upon dry bread,
      and had naught but his tears with which he could water it. And
      three days after he suffered so much from the heat and from
      weariness that he said to his master: 'I can work no more, for all
      my limbs do ache. How long would you torment me?' 'Till the day
      when by the labor of your hands you pay me all your debts, and
      when seven years are passed, you will be free.' And the desperate
      son answered weeping: 'But I cannot bear so much as seven days.
      Have pity on me, for all my limbs do burn and ache.' And the
      wicked creditor cried out: 'Press on with the work; if you could
      for seven years spend your days and your nights in riotousness,
      now must you work for seven years. I will not forgive you till you
      pay back all your debts to the uttermost drachma.' And the son,
      with his limbs racked with pain, went back despairing to the
      fields to continue his work. Already he could hardly stand upon
      his feet because of his weariness and of his pains, when the
      seventh day was come -- the Sabbath day, in which no man ￼works in
      the field. Then the son gathered the remnant of his strength and
      staggered to the house of his father. And he cast himself down at
      his father's feet and said: 'Father, believe me for the last time
      and forgive me all my offenses against you, I swear to you that I
      will never again live riotously and that I will be your obedient
      son in all things. Free me from the hands of my oppressor. Father,
      look upon me and upon my sick limbs, and harden not your heart.'
      Then tears came into his father's eyes, and he took his son in his
      arms, and said: 'Let us rejoice, for today a great joy is given
      me, because I have found again my beloved son, who was lost.' And
      he clothed him with his choicest raiment and all the day long they
      made merry. And on the morning of the morrow he gave his son a bag
      of silver that he might pay to his creditors all that he owed
      them. And when his son came back, he said to him: 'My son, do you
      see that it is easy, through riotous living, to incur debts for
      seven years, but their payment is difficult by the heavy labor of
      seven years.' 'Father, it is indeed hard to pay them, even for
      seven days.' And his father admonished him, saying: 'For this once
      alone has it been permitted you to pay your debts in seven days
      instead of seven years, the rest is forgiven you. But take heed
      that in the time to come you do not incur more debts. For I tell
      you truly, that none else but your father forgives you your debts,
      because you are his son. For with all else you would have had to
      labor hard for seven years, as it is commanded in our laws.'<br>
      <br>
      My father, I will henceforth be your loving and obedient son, and
      I will not any more incur debts, for I know that their payment is
      hard.'<br>
      <br>
      "And he went to his father's field and watched every day over the
      work of his father's laborers. And he never made his laborers work
      hard, for he remembered his own heavy labor. And the years passed,
      and his father's possessions increased ever more and more beneath
      his hand, for the blessing of his father was upon his labor. And
      slowly he gave back tenfold to his father all that he had
      squandered in the seven years. And when his father saw that his
      son used well his servants and all his possessions, he said to
      him: 'My son, I see that my possessions are in good hands. I give
      you all my cattle, my house, my lands and my treasures. Let all
      this be your heritage, continue increasing it that I may have
      delight in you.' And when the son had received his inheritance
      from his father, he forgave their debts to all his debtors who
      could not pay him, for he did not forget that his debt also had
      been forgiven when he could not pay it. And God blessed him with
      long life, with many children and with much riches, because he was
      kind to all his servants and to all his cattle."<br>
      <br>
      Then Jesus turned to the sick folk and said: "I speak to you in
      parables that you may better understand God's word. The seven
      years of eating and drinking and of riotous living are the sins of
      the past. The wicked creditor is Satan. The debts are diseases.
      The heavy labor is pains. The prodigal son, he is yourselves. The
      payment of the debts is the casting from you of devils and
      diseases, and the healing of your body. The bag of silver received
      from the father is the liberating power of the angels. The father
      is God. The father's possessions are earth and heaven. The
      servants of the father are the angels. The father's field is the
      world, which is changed into the kingdom of the heavens, if the
      Sons of Man work thereon together with the angels of the Heavenly
      Father. For I tell you, it is better that the son should obey his
      father and keep watch over his father's servants in the field,
      than that he should become the debtor of the wicked creditor and
      toil and sweat in serfdom to repay all his debts. it is better,
      likewise, if the Sons of Man also obey the laws of their Heavenly
      Father, and work together with his angels upon his kingdom, than
      that they should become the debtors of Satan, the lord of death,
      of all sins and all diseases, and that they should suffer with
      pains and sweat till they have repaid all their sins. I tell you
      truly, great and many are your sins. Many years have you yielded
      to the enticings of Satan. You have been gluttonous, wine-bibers
      and gone a-whoring, and your past debts have multiplied. And now
      you must repay them, and payment is difficult and hard. Be not,
      therefore, already impatient after the third day, like the
      prodigal son, but wait patiently for the seventh day which is
      sanctified by God, and then go with humble and obedient heart
      before the face of your Heavenly Father, that he may forgive you
      your sins and all your past debts. I tell you truly, your Heavenly
      Father loves you without end, for he also allows you to pay in
      seven days the debts of seven years. Those that owe the sins and
      diseases of seven years, but pay honestly and persevere till the
      seventh day, to them shall our Heavenly Father forgive the debts
      of all these seven years.<br>
      <br>
      "If we sin for seven times seven years?" asked a sick man who
      suffered horribly. "Even in that case the Heavenly Father forgives
      you all your debts in seven times seven days.<br>
      <br>
      "Happy are those that persevere to the end, for the devils of
      Satan write all your evil deeds in a book, in the book of your
      body and your spirit. I tell you truly, there is not one sinful
      deed, but it is written, even from the beginning of the world,
      before our Heavenly Father. For you may escape the laws made by
      kings, ￼but the laws of your God, these may none of the Sons of
      Man escape. And when you come before the face of God, the devils
      of Satan bear witness against you with your deed, and God sees
      your sins written in the book of your body and of your spirit and
      is sad in his heart. But if you repent of your sins, and by
      fasting and prayer you seek the angels of God, then each day that
      you continue to fast and to pray, God's angels blot out one year
      of your evil deeds from the book of your body and your spirit. And
      when the last page is also blotted out and cleansed from all your
      sins, you stand before the face of God, and God rejoices in his
      heart and forgets all your sins. He frees you from the clutches of
      Satan and from suffering; he takes you within his house and
      commands that all his servants, all his angels serve you. Long
      life does he give you, and you shall never see disease. And if,
      thenceforward, instead of sinning, you pass your days in doing
      good deeds, then the angels of God shall write all your good deeds
      in the book of your body and of your spirit. I tell you truly, no
      good deed remains unwritten before God, not from the beginning of
      the world. For from your kings and your governors you may wait in
      vain for your reward, but never do your good deeds want their
      reward from God.<br>
      <br>
      "And when you come before the face of God, his angels bear witness
      for you with your good deeds. And God sees your good deeds written
      in your bodies and in your spirits, and rejoices in his heart. He
      blesses your body and your spirit and all your deeds, and gives
      you for a heritage his earthly and heavenly kingdom, that in it
      you may have life everlasting. Happy is he who can enter into the
      kingdom of God, for he shall never see death."<br>
      <br>
      And a great silence fell at his words. And those that were
      discouraged took new strength from his words and continued to fast
      and to pray. And he who had spoken the first, said to him: "I will
      persevere to the seventh day." And the second, likewise, said to
      him: "I also will persevere to the seven times seventh day."<br>
      <br>
      Jesus answered them: "Happy are those that persevere to the end,
      for they shall inherit the earth."<br>
      <br>
      And there were many sick among them tormented with grievous pains,
      and they hardly crawled to Jesus' feet. For they could no longer
      walk upon their feet. They said: "Master, we are grievously
      tormented with pain; tell us what we shall do." And they showed
      Jesus their feet in which the bones were twisted and knotted and
      said: "Neither the angel of air, nor of water, nor of sunshine has
      assuaged our pains, notwithstanding that we baptized ourselves,
      and do fast and pray, and follow your words in all things."<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you truly, your bones will be healed. Be not discouraged,
      but seek for cure nigh the healer of bones, the angel of earth.
      For thence were your bones taken, and thither will they return."<br>
      <br>
      And he pointed with his hand to where the running of the water and
      the sun's heat had softened to clayey mud the earth by the edge of
      the water. "Sink your feet in the mire, that the embrace of the
      angel of earth may draw out from your bones all uncleanness and
      all disease. And you will see Satan and your pains fly from the
      embrace of the angel of earth. And the knots of your bones will
      vanish away, and they will be straightened, and all your pains
      will disappear."<br>
      <br>
      And the sick followed his words, for they knew that they would be
      healed.<br>
      <br>
      And there were also other sick who suffered much from their pains,
      howbeit, they persisted in their fasting. And their force was
      spent, and great heat tormented them. And when they would have
      risen from their bed to go to Jesus, their heads began to turn, as
      if it were a gusty wind which shook them, and as oft as they tried
      to stand upon their feet they fell back to the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Then Jesus went to them and said: "You suffer, for Satan and his
      diseases torment your bodies. But fear not, for their power over
      you will quickly end. For Satan is like a choleric neighbor who
      entered his neighbor's house while he was absent, intending to
      take his goods away to his own house. But some told the other that
      his enemy was ravaging within his house, and he came back to his
      house, running. And when the wicked neighbor, having gathered
      together all that pleased him, saw from afar the master of the
      house returning in haste, then he was very wroth that he could not
      take all away, and set to breaking and spoiling all that was
      there, to destroy all. So that even if the things might not be
      his, the other might have nothing. But immediately the lord of the
      house came in, and before the wicked neighbor fulfilled his
      purpose, he took him and cast him out of the house. I tell you
      truly, even so did Satan enter your bodies which are the
      habitation of God. And he took in his power all that he wished to
      steal: your breath, your blood, your bone, your flesh, your
      bowels, your eyes, and your ears. But by your fasting and your
      prayer, you have called back the lord of your body ￼and his
      angels. And now Satan sees that the true lord of your body
      returns, and that it is the end of his power. Wherefore, in his
      wrath he gathers his strength once again, that he may destroy your
      bodies before the coming of the lord. It is for this that Satan
      torments you so grievously, for he feels that the end is come. But
      let not your hearts tremble, for soon will the angels of God
      appear, to occupy again their abodes and rededicate them as
      temples of God. And they will seize Satan and cast him from your
      bodies with all his diseases and all his uncleannesses. And happy
      will you be, for you will receive the reward of your
      steadfastness, and you will never see disease."<br>
      <br>
      And there was among the sick, one that was more tormented by Satan
      than all the others. And his body was as parched as a skeleton,
      and his skin yellow as a falling leaf. He was so weak already that
      he could not, even upon his hands, crawl to Jesus, and cried only
      to him from afar: "Master, have pity on me, for never has man
      suffered, not from the beginning of the world, as I do suffer. I
      know that you are indeed sent by God, and I know that if you will,
      you can straightway cast out Satan from my body. Do not the angels
      of God obey God's messenger? Come, Master, and cast out Satan from
      me now, for he rages angrily within me and grievous is his
      torment."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered him: "Satan torments you thus greatly because
      you have already fasted many days, and you do not pay to him his
      tribute. You do not feed him with all the abominations with which
      you hitherto defiled the temple of your spirit. You torment Satan
      with hunger, and so in his anger he torments you also. Fear not,
      for I tell you, Satan will be destroyed before your body is
      destroyed; for while you fast and pray, the angels of God protect
      your body, that Satan's power may not destroy you. And the anger
      of Satan is impotent against the angels of God."<br>
      <br>
      Then they all came to Jesus and with loud cries besought him
      saying: "Master, have compassion on him, for he suffers more than
      we all, and if you do not at once cast Satan out of him, we fear
      he will not live until tomorrow."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered them: "Great is your faith. Be it according to
      your faith, and you shall see soon, face to face, the frightful
      countenance of Satan, and the power of the Son of Man. For I will
      cast out from you the powerful Satan by the strength of the
      innocent lamb of God, the weakest creature of the Lord. For the
      holy spirit of God makes more powerful the weakest than the
      strongest."<br>
      <br>
      ￼And Jesus milked an ewe which was feeding among the grass. And he
      put the milk upon the sand made hot by the sun, saying: "Lo, the
      power of the angel of water has entered this milk. And now the
      power of the angel of sunshine will enter it also."<br>
      <br>
      And the milk became hot by the strength of the sun.<br>
      <br>
      "And now the angels of water and of sun will join with the angel
      of air." And lo, the vapor of the hot milk began to rise slowly
      into the air.<br>
      <br>
      "Come and breathe in by your mouth the strength of the angels of
      water, of sunshine, and of air, that it may come into your body
      and cast out the Satan from you."<br>
      <br>
      And the sick man whom Satan tormented did breathe within himself,
      deeply, the rising whitish vapor.<br>
      <br>
      "Straightway will Satan leave your body, since for three days he
      starves and finds no food within you. He will come out of you to
      satisfy his hunger by the hot steaming milk, for this food finds
      favor in his sight. He will smell its smell, and will not be able
      to resist the hunger which has tormented him three days already.
      But the Son of Man will destroy his body, that he may torment none
      else again."<br>
      <br>
      Then the sick man's body was seized with an ague, and he retched
      as though he would vomit, but he could not. And he gasped for air,
      for his breath was spent. And he fainted on the lap of Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      "Now does Satan leave his body. See him." And Jesus pointed to the
      sick man's opened mouth.<br>
      <br>
      And then they all saw with astonishment and terror that Satan was
      coming out from his mouth in the shape of an abominable worm,
      straight towards the steaming milk. Then Jesus took two sharp
      stones in his hands and crushed the head of Satan, and drew out
      from the sick man all the body of the monster which was almost as
      long as the man. When the abominable worm came out of the sick
      ￼man's throat, he recovered at once his breath, and then all his
      pains ceased. And the others looked with terror at the abominable
      body of Satan.<br>
      <br>
      "See, what an abominable beast you carried and nourished in your
      body for long years. I have cast it out of you and killed it that
      it may never again torment you. Give thanks to God that his angels
      have made you free, and sin no more, lest Satan return to you
      again. Let your body be henceforth a temple dedicated to your
      God."<br>
      <br>
      And they were all amazed at his words and at his power. And they
      said: "Master, you are indeed God's messenger, and do know all
      secrets."<br>
      <br>
      "And you," answered Jesus, "be true Sons of God, that you also may
      partake in his power and in the knowledge of all secrets. For
      wisdom and power can come only from the love of God. Love,
      therefore, your Heavenly Father and your Earthly Mother with all
      your heart, and with all your spirit. And serve them, that their
      angels may serve you also. Let all your deeds be sacrificed to
      God. And feed not Satan, for the wages of sin is death. But with
      God lies the reward of the good, his love, which is knowledge and
      power of eternal life."<br>
      <br>
      And they all knelt down to give thanks to God for his love.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus departed, saying: "I will come again to all who persist
      in prayer and fasting 'til the seventh day. Peace be with you."<br>
      <br>
      And the sick man from whom Jesus had cast out the Satan, stood up,
      for the strength of life had come back to him. He breathed out
      deeply, and his eyes became clear, for every pain had left him.
      And he cast himself down upon the ground where Jesus had stood,
      and he kissed the print of his feet and he wept.<br>
      <br>
      And it was by the bed of a stream, many sick fasted and prayed
      with God's angels for seven days and seven nights. And great was
      their reward, because they followed Jesus' words. And with the
      passing of the seventh day, all their pains left them. And when
      the sun rose over the earth's rim they saw Jesus coming towards
      them from the mountain, with the brightness of the rising sun
      about his head.<br>
      <br>
      "Peace be with you."<br>
      <br>
      And they said no word at all, but only cast themselves down before
      him, and touched the hem of his garment in token of their healing.<br>
      <br>
      "Give thanks not to me, but to your Earthly Mother, who sent you
      her healing angels. Go, and sin no more, that you may never again
      see disease. And let the healing angels become your guardians."<br>
      <br>
      But they answered him: "Whither should we go, Master, for with you
      are the words of eternal life? Tell us, what are the sins which we
      must shun, that we may nevermore see disease?"<br>
      <br>
      Jesus answered: "Be it so according to your faith," and he sat
      down among them, saying:<br>
      <br>
      "It was said to them of old time, 'Honor thy Heavenly Father and
      thy Earthly Mother, and do their commandments, that thy days may
      be long upon the earth.' And next afterward was given this
      commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,' for life is given to all by
      God, and that which God has given, let not man take away. For I
      tell you truly, from one Mother proceeds all that lives upon the
      earth. Therefore, he who kills, kills his brother. And from him
      will the Earthly Mother turn away, and will pluck from him her
      quickening breasts. And he will be shunned by her angels, and
      Satan will have his dwelling in his body. And the flesh of slain
      beasts in his body will become his own tomb. For I tell you truly,
      he who kills, kills himself, and whoso eats the flesh of slain
      beasts, eats of the body of death. For in his blood every drop of
      their blood turns to poison; in his breath their breath to stink;
      in his flesh their flesh to boils; in his bones their bones to
      chalk; in his bowels their bowels to decay; in his eyes their eyes
      to scales; in his ears their ears to waxy issue. And their death
      will become his death. For only in the service of your Heavenly
      Father are your debts of seven years forgiven in seven clays. But
      Satan forgives you nothing and you must pay him for all. 'Eye for
      eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot; burning for
      burning, wound for wound; life for life, death for death.' For the
      wages of sin is death. Kill not, neither eat the flesh of your
      innocent prey, lest you become the slaves of Satan. For that is
      the path of sufferings, and it leads unto death. But do the will
      of God, that his angels may serve you on the way of life. Obey,
      therefore, the words of God: 'Behold, I have given you every herb
      bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
      tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
      shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every
      fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth,
      wherein there is breath of life, I give every green herb for meat.
      Also the milk of every thing that moveth and liveth upon earth
      shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given unto
      them, so I give their milk unto you. But flesh, and the blood
      which quickens it, shall ye not eat. And, surely, your spurting
      blood will I require, your blood wherein is your soul; I will
      require all slain beasts, and the souls of all slain men. For I
      the Lord thy God am a God strong and jealous, visiting the
      iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
      fourth generation of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto
      thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Love the
      Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
      all thy strength: this is the first and greatest commandment.' And
      the second is like unto it: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' There
      is none other commandment greater than these."<br>
      <br>
      And after these words they all remained silent, save one, who
      called out: "What am I to do, Master, if I see a wild beast rend
      my brother in the forest? Shall I let my brother perish, or kill
      the wild beast? Shall not I thus transgress the law?"<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered: "It was said to them of old time: "All beasts
      that move upon the earth, all the fish of the sea, and all the
      fowl of the air are given into thy power." I tell you truly, of
      all creatures living upon the earth, God created only man after
      his image. Wherefore beasts are for man, and not man for beasts.
      You do not, therefore, transgress the law if you kill the wild
      beast to save your brother's life. For I tell you truly, man is
      more than the beast. But he who kills the beast without a cause,
      though the beast attack him not, through lust for slaughter, or
      for its flesh, or for its hide, or yet for its tusks, evil is the
      deed which he does, for he is turned into a wild beast himself.
      Wherefore is his end also as the end of the wild beasts."<br>
      <br>
      Then another said: "Moses, the greatest in Israel, suffered our
      forefathers to eat the flesh of clean beasts, and forbade only the
      flesh of unclean beasts. Why, therefore, do you forbid us the
      flesh of all beasts? Which law comes from God? That of Moses, or
      your law?"<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered: "God gave, by Moses, ten commandments to your
      forefathers. 'These commandments are hard,' said your forefathers,
      and they could not keep them. When Moses saw this, he had
      compassion on his people, and would not that they perish. And then
      he gave them ten times ten commandments. For he whose feet are
      strong as the mountain of Zion, needs no crutches; but he whose
      limbs do shake, gets further having crutches, than without them.
      And Moses said to the Lord: 'My heart is filled with sorrow, for
      my people will be lost. For they are without knowledge, and are
      not able to understand thy commandments. They are as little
      children who cannot yet understand their father's words. Suffer,
      Lord, that I give them other laws, that they may not perish. If
      they may not be with thee, Lord, let them not be against thee;
      that they may sustain themselves, and when the time has come, and
      they are ripe for thy words, reveal to them thy laws.' For that
      did Moses break the two tablets of stone whereon were written the
      ten commandments, and he gave them ten times ten in their stead.
      And of these ten times ten the Scribes and Pharisees have made a
      hundred times ten commandments. And they have laid unbearable
      burdens on your shoulders, that they themselves do not carry. For
      the more nigh are the commandments to God, the less do we need;
      and the farther they are from God, then the more do we need.
      Wherefore are the laws of the Pharisees and Scribes innumerable;
      the laws of the Son of Man seven; of the angels three; and of God
      one.<br>
      <br>
      "Therefore, I teach you only those laws which you can understand,
      that you may become men, and follow the seven laws of the Son of
      Man. Then will the unknown angels of the Heavenly Father also
      reveal their laws to you, that God's holy spirit may descend upon
      you, and lead you to his law."<br>
      <br>
      And all were astonished at his wisdom, and asked him: "Continue,
      Master, and teach us all the laws which we can receive."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus continued: "God commanded your forefathers: 'Thou shalt
      not kill.' But their heart was hardened and they killed. Then
      Moses desired that at least they should not kill men, and he
      suffered them to kill beasts. And then the heart of your
      forefathers was hardened yet more, and they killed men and beasts
      likewise. But I do say to you: Kill neither men, nor beasts, nor
      yet the food which goes into your mouth. For if you eat living
      food, the same will quicken you, but if you kill your food, the
      dead food will kill you also. For life comes only from life, and
      from death comes always death. For everything which kills your
      foods, kills your bodies also. And everything which kills your
      bodies kills your souls also. And your bodies become what your
      foods are, even as your spirits, likewise, become what your
      thoughts are. Therefore, eat not anything ￼which fire, or frost,
      or water has destroyed. For burned, frozen and rotted foods will
      burn, freeze and rot your body also. Be not like the foolish
      husbandman who sowed in his ground cooked, and frozen, and rotten
      seeds. And the autumn came, and his fields bore nothing. And great
      was his distress. But be like that husbandman who sowed in his
      field living seed, and whose field bore living ears of wheat,
      paying a hundredfold for the seeds which he planted. For I tell
      you truly, live only by the fire of life, and prepare not your
      foods with the fire of death, which kills your foods, your bodies
      and your souls also."<br>
      <br>
      "Master, where is the fire of life?" asked some of them. "In you,
      in your blood, and in your bodies."<br>
      <br>
      "And the fire of death?" asked others.<br>
      <br>
      "It is the fire which blazes outside your body, which is hotter
      than your blood. With that fire of death you cook your foods in
      your homes and in your fields. I tell you truly, it is the same
      fire which destroys your foods and your bodies, even as the fire
      of malice, which ravages your thoughts, ravages your spirits. For
      your body is that which you eat, and your spirit is that which you
      think. Eat nothing, therefore, which a stronger fire than the fire
      of life has killed. Wherefore, prepare and eat all fruits of
      trees, and all grasses of the fields, and all milk of beasts good
      for eating. For all these are fed and ripened by the fire of life;
      all are the gift of the angels of our Earthly Mother. But eat
      nothing to which only the fire of death gives savor, for such is
      of Satan."<br>
      <br>
      "How should we cook our daily bread without fire, Master?" asked
      some with great astonishment.<br>
      <br>
      "Let the angels of God prepare your bread. Moisten your wheat,
      that the angel of water may enter it. Then set it in the air, that
      the angel of air also may embrace it. And leave it from morning to
      evening beneath the sun, that the angel of sunshine may descend
      upon it. And the blessing of the three angels will soon make the
      germ of life to sprout in your wheat. Then crush your grain, and
      make thin wafers, as did your forefathers when they departed out
      of Egypt, the house of bondage. Put them back again beneath the
      sun from its appearing, and when it is risen to its highest in the
      heavens, turn them over on the other side that they be embraced
      there also by the angel of sunshine, and leave them there until
      the sun be set. For the angels of water, of air, and of sunshine
      fed and ripened the wheat in the field, and they, likewise, must
      prepare also your bread. And the same sun which, with the fire of
      life, made the wheat to grow and ripen, must cook your bread with
      the same fire. For the fire of the sun gives life to the wheat, to
      the bread, and to the body. But the fire of death kills the wheat,
      the bread, and the body. And the living angels of the living God
      serve only living men. For God is the God of the living, and not
      the God of the dead.<br>
      <br>
      "So eat always from the table of God: the fruits of the trees, the
      grain and grasses of the field, the milk of beasts, and the honey
      of bees. For everything beyond these is of Satan, and leads by the
      way of sins and of diseases unto death. But the foods which you
      eat from the abundant table of God give strength and youth to your
      body, and you will never see diseases For the table of God fed
      Methuselah of old, and I tell you truly, if you live even as he
      lived, then will the God of the living give you also long life
      upon the earth as was his.<br>
      <br>
      "For I tell you truly, the God of the living is richer than all
      the rich of the earth, and his abundant table is richer than the
      richest table of feasting of all the rich upon the earth. Eat,
      therefore, all your life at the table of our Earthly Mother, and
      you will never see want. And when you eat at her table, eat all
      things even as they are found on the table of the Earthly Mother.
      Cook not, neither mix all things one with another, lest your
      bowels become as steaming bogs. For I tell you truly, this is
      abominable in the eyes of the Lord.<br>
      <br>
      "And be not like the greedy servant, who always ate up, at the
      table of his lord, the portions of others. And he devoured
      everything himself, and mixed all together in his gluttony. And
      seeing that, his lord was wroth with him, and drove him from the
      table. And when all had ended their meal, he mixed together all
      that remained upon the table, and called the greedy servant to
      him, and said: 'Take and eat all this with the swine, for your
      place is with them, and not at my table.'<br>
      <br>
      "Take heed, therefore, and defile not with all kinds of
      abominations the temple of your bodies. Be content with two or
      three sorts of food, which you will find always upon the table of
      our Earthly Mother. And desire not to devour all things which you
      see around you. For I tell you truly, if you mix together all
      sorts of food in your body, then the peace of your body will
      cease, and endless war will rage in you. And it will be blotted
      out even as homes and kingdoms divided against themselves work
      their own destruction. For your God is the God of peace, and does
      never help division. Arouse not, therefore, against you the wrath
      of God, lest he drive you from his table, and lest you be
      compelled to go to the table of Satan, where the fire of sins,
      diseases, and death will corrupt your body.<br>
      <br>
      "And when you eat, never eat unto fullness. Flee the temptations
      of Satan, and listen to the voice of God's angels. For Satan and
      his power tempt you always to eat more and more. But live by the
      spirit, and resist the desires of the body. And your fasting is
      always pleasing in the eyes of the angels of God. So give heed to
      how much you have eaten when your body is sated, and always eat
      less by a third.<br>
      <br>
      "Let the weight of your daily food be not less than a mina, but
      mark that it go not beyond two. Then will the angels of God serve
      you always, and you will never fall into the bondage of Satan and
      of his diseases. Trouble not the work of the angels in your body
      by eating often. For I tell you truly, he who eats more than twice
      in the clay does in him the work of Satan. And the angels of God
      leave his body, and soon Satan will take possession of it. Eat
      only when the sun is highest in the heavens, and again when it is
      set. And you will never see disease, for such finds favor in the
      eyes of the Lord. And if you will that the angels of God rejoice
      in your body, and that Satan shun you afar, then sit but once in
      the day at the table of God. And then your days will be long upon
      the earth, for this is pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. Eat
      always when the table of God is served before you, and eat always
      of that which you find upon the table of God. For I tell you
      truly, God knows well what your body needs, and when it needs.<br>
      <br>
      "From the coming of the month of Ijar, eat barley; from the month
      of Sivan, eat wheat, the most perfect among all seed-bearing
      herbs. And let your daily bread be made of wheat, that the Lord
      may take care of your bodies. From Tammuz, eat the sour grape,
      that your body may diminish and Satan may depart from it. In the
      month of Elul, gather the grape that the juice may serve you as
      drink. In the month of Marchesvan, gather the sweet grape, dried
      and sweetened by the angel of sun, that your bodies may increase,
      for the angels of the Lord dwell in them. You should eat figs rich
      in juice in the months of Ab and Shebat, and what remain, let the
      angel of sun keep them for you; eat them with the meat of almonds
      in all the months when the trees bear no fruits. And the herbs
      which come after rain, these eat in the month of Thebet, that your
      blood may be cleansed of all your sins. And in the same month
      begin to eat also the milk of your beasts, because for this did
      the Lord give the herbs of the fields to all the ￼beasts which
      render milk, that they might with their milk feed man. For I tell
      you truly, happy are they that eat only at the table of God, and
      eschew all the abominations of Satan. Eat not unclean foods
      brought from far countries, but eat always that which your trees
      bear. For your God knows well what is needful for you, and where
      and when. And he gives to all peoples of all kingdoms for food
      that which is best for each. Eat not as the heathen do, who stuff
      themselves in haste, defiling their bodies with all manner of
      abominations.<br>
      <br>
      "For the power of God's angels enters into you with the living
      food which the Lord gives you from his royal table. And when you
      eat, have above you the angel of air, and below you the angel of
      water. Breathe long and deeply at all your meals, that the angel
      of air may bless your repasts. And chew well your food with your
      teeth, that it become water, and that the angel of water turn it
      into blood in your body. And eat slowly, as it were a prayer you
      make to the Lord. For I tell you truly, the power of God enters
      into you, if you eat after this manner at his table. But Satan
      turns into a steaming bog the body of him upon whom the angels of
      air and water do not descend at his repasts. And the Lord suffers
      him no longer at his table. For the table of the Lord is an altar,
      and he who eats at the table of God is in a temple. For I tell you
      truly, the body of the Son of Man is turned into a temple, and his
      inwards into an altar, if he does the commandments of God.
      Wherefore, put naught upon the altar of the Lord when your spirit
      is vexed, neither think upon any one with anger in the temple of
      God. And enter only into the Lord's sanctuary when you feel in
      yourselves the call of his angels, for all that you eat in sorrow,
      or in anger, or without desire, becomes a poison in your body. For
      the breath of Satan defiles all these. Place with joy your
      offerings upon the altar of your body, and let all evil thoughts
      depart from you when you receive into your body the power of God
      from his table. And never sit at the table of God before he call
      you by the angel of appetite.<br>
      <br>
      "Rejoice, therefore, always with God's angels at their royal
      table, for this is pleasing to the heart of the Lord. And your
      life will be long upon the earth, for the most precious of God's
      servants will serve you all your days: the angel of joy.<br>
      <br>
      "And forget not that every seventh day is holy and consecrated to
      God. On six days feed your body with the gifts of the Earthly
      Mother, but on the seventh day sanctify your body for your
      Heavenly Father. On the seventh day eat not any earthly food, but
      live only on the words of God, and be all the day with the angels
      of the Lord in the kingdom of the Heavenly Father. And on the
      seventh day let the angels of God build the kingdom of the heavens
      in your body, as you labor for six days in the kingdom of the
      Earthly Mother. And let not food trouble the work of the angels in
      your body throughout the seventh day. And God will give you long
      life upon earth, that you may have life everlasting in the kingdom
      of the heavens. For I tell you truly, if you see not diseases any
      more upon earth, you will live for ever in the kingdom of the
      heavens.<br>
      <br>
      "And God will send you each morning the angel of sunshine to wake
      you from your sleep. Therefore, obey your Heavenly Father's
      summons, and lie not idle in your beds, for the angels of air and
      water await you already without. And labor all day long with the
      angels of the Earthly Mother that you may come to know them and
      their works ever more and more well. But when the sun is set, and
      your Heavenly Father sends you his most precious angel, sleep,
      then take your rest, and be all the night with the angel of sleep.
      And then will your Heavenly Father send you his unknown angels,
      that they may be with you the livelong night. And the Heavenly
      Father's unknown angels will teach you many things concerning the
      kingdom of God, even as the angels that you know of the Earthly
      Mother, instruct you in the things of her kingdom. For I tell you
      truly, you will be every night the guests of the kingdom of your
      Heavenly Father, if you do his commandments. And when you wake up
      upon the morrow, you will feel in you the power of the unknown
      angels. And your Heavenly Father will send them to you every
      night, that they may build your spirit, even as every day the
      Earthly Mother sends you her angels, that they may build your
      body. For I tell you truly, if in the daytime your Earthly Mother
      folds you in her arms, and in the night the Heavenly Father
      breathes his kiss upon you, then will the Sons of Men become the
      Sons of God.<br>
      <br>
      "Resist day and night the temptations of Satan. Wake not by night,
      neither sleep by day, lest the angels of God depart from you.<br>
      <br>
      "And take no delight in any drink, nor in any smoke from Satan,
      waking you by night and making you to sleep by day. For I tell you
      truly, all the drinks and smokes of Satan are abominations in the
      eyes of your God.<br>
      <br>
      "Commit not whoredom, by night or by day, for the whoremonger is
      like a tree whose sap runs out from its trunk. And that tree will
      be dried up before its time, nor will it ever bear fruit.
      Therefore, go not a-whoring, lest Satan dry up your body, and the
      Lord make your seed unfruitful.<br>
      <br>
      "Shun all that is too hot and too cold. For it is the will of your
      Earthly Mother that neither heat nor cold should harm your body.
      And let not your bodies become either hotter or colder than as
      God's angels warm or cool them. And if you do the commandments of
      the Earthly Mother, then as oft as your body becomes too hot, will
      she send the angel of coolness to cool you, and as oft as your
      body becomes too cold, will she send you the angel of heat to warm
      you again.<br>
      <br>
      "Follow the example of all the angels of the Heavenly Father and
      of the Earthly Mother, who work day and night, without ceasing,
      upon the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth. Therefore,
      receive also into yourselves the strongest of God's angels, the
      angel of deeds, and work all together upon the kingdom of God.
      Follow the example of the running water, the wind as it blows, the
      rising and setting of the sun, the growing plants and trees, the
      beasts as they run and gambol, the wane and waxing of the moon,
      the stars as they come and go again; all these do move, and do
      perform their labors. For all which has life does move, and only
      that which is dead is still. And God is the God of the living, and
      Satan that of the dead. Serve, therefore, the living God, that the
      eternal movement of life may sustain you, and that you may escape
      the eternal stillness of death. Work, therefore, without ceasing,
      to build the kingdom of God, lest you be cast into the kingdom of
      Satan. For eternal joy abounds in the living kingdom of God, but
      still sorrow darkens the kingdom of death of Satan. Be, therefore,
      true Sons of your Earthly Mother and of your Heavenly Father, that
      you fall not as slaves of Satan. And your Earthly Mother and
      Heavenly Father will send you their angels to teach, to love, and
      to serve you. And their angels will write the commandments of God
      in your head, in your heart, and in your hands, that you may know,
      feel, and do God's commandments.<br>
      <br>
      "And pray every day to your Heavenly Father and Earthly mother,
      that your soul become as perfect as your Heavenly Father's holy
      spirit is perfect, and that your body become as perfect as the
      body of your Earthly Mother is perfect. For if you understand,
      feel, and do the commandments, then all for which you pray to your
      Heavenly Father and your Earthly Mother will be given you. For the
      wisdom, the love, and the power of God are above all.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father: Our
      Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
      day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
      debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
      evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for
      ever. Amen.<br>
      <br>
      "And after this manner pray to your Earthly Mother: Our Mother
      which art upon earth, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, and
      thy will be done in us, as it is in thee. As thou sendest every
      day thy angels, send them to us also. Forgive us our sins, as we
      atone all our sins against thee. And lead us not into sickness,
      but deliver us from all evil, for thine is the earth, the body,
      and the health. Amen.<br>
      <br>
      And they all prayed together with Jesus to the Heavenly Father and
      to the Earthly Mother.<br>
      <br>
      And afterwards Jesus spoke thus to them: "Even as your bodies have
      been reborn through the Earthly Mother's angels, may your spirit,
      likewise, be reborn through the angels of the Heavenly Father.
      Become, therefore, true Sons of your Father and of your Mother,
      and true Brothers of the Sons of Men. Till now you were at war
      with your Father, with your Mother, and with your Brothers. And
      you have served Satan. From today live at peace with your Heavenly
      Father, and with your Earthly Mother, and with your Brothers, the
      Sons of Men. And fight only against Satan, lest he rob you of your
      peace. I give the peace of your Earthly Mother to your body, and
      the peace of your Heavenly Father to your spirit. And let the
      peace of both reign among the Sons of Men.<br>
      <br>
      "Come to me, all that are weary and that suffer in strife and
      affliction! For my peace will strengthen you and comfort you. For
      my peace is exceeding full of joy. Wherefore do I always greet you
      after this manner: 'Peace be with you!' Do you always, therefore,
      so greet one another, that upon your body may descend the peace of
      your Earthly Mother, and upon your spirit the peace of your
      Heavenly Father. And then you will find peace also among
      yourselves, for the kingdom of God is within you. And now return
      to your Brothers with whom hitherto you were at war, and give your
      peace to them also. For happy are they that strive for peace, for
      they will find the peace of God. Go, and sin no more. And give to
      every one your peace, even as I have given my peace unto you. For
      my peace is of God. Peace be with you."<br>
      <br>
      And he left them.<br>
      <br>
      And his peace descended upon them; and in their heart the angel of
      love, in their head the wisdom of law, and in their hands the
      power of rebirth, they went forth among the Sons of Men, to bring
      the light of peace to those that warred in darkness.<br>
      <br>
      And they parted, wishing one to another:<br>
      <br>
      "PEACE BE WITH YOU."<br>

      <br>
      I have to begin this preface with a great confession: this is not
      my first translation of Book Two of the Essene Gospel of Peace; it
      is my second. The first effort took many years to complete, and it
      was composed painstakingly and literally, with hundreds of cross
      references and abundant philological and exegetical footnotes.
      When it was finished, I was very proud of it, and in a glow of
      self-satisfied accomplishment, I gave it to my friend, Aldous
      Huxley, to read. Two weeks later, I asked him what he thought of
      my monumental translation. "It is very, very bad, he answered. "It
      is even worse than the most boring treatises of the patristics and
      scholastics, which nobody reads today. It is so dry and
      uninteresting, in fact, that I have no desire to read Book Three."
      I was speechless, so he continued. "You should rewrite it, and
      give it some of the vitality of your other books -make it
      literary, readable and attractive for twentieth century readers.
      I'm sure the Essenes did not speak to each other in footnotes! In
      the form it is in now, the only readers you will have for it may
      be a few dogmatists in theological seminaries, who seem to take
      masochistic pleasure in reading this sort of thing. However," he
      added with a smile, "you might find some value in it as a cure for
      insomnia; each time I tried to read it I fell asleep in a few
      minutes. You might try to sell a few copies that way by
      advertising a new sleep remedy in the health magazines - no
      harmful chemicals, and all that."<br>
      <br>
      It took me a long time to recuperate from his criticism. I put
      aside the manuscript for years. Meanwhile, I continued to receive
      thousands of letters from many readers from all parts of the world
      of my translation of Book One of the Essene Gospel of Peace,
      asking for the second and third books promised in the preface.
      Finally, I got the courage to start again. The passing of the
      years had mellowed my attitude and I saw my friend's criticism in
      a new light. I rewrote the entire manuscript, treating it as
      literature and poetry, coming to grips with the great problems of
      life, both ancient and contemporary. It was not easy to be
      faithful to the original, and at the same time to present the
      eternal truths in a way that would appeal to twentieth century
      man. And yet, it was vitally important that I try; for the
      Essenes, above all others, strove to win the hearts of men through
      reason, and the powerful and vivid example of their lives.<br>
      <br>
      Sadly, Aldous is no longer here to read my second translation. I
      have a feeling he would have liked it (not a single footnote!),
      but I will have to leave the final judgment to my readers. If
      Books Two and Three will become as popular as Book One, my efforts
      of many, many years will be amply rewarded.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      There are three paths leading to Truth. The first is the path of
      the consciousness, the second that of nature, and the third is the
      accumulated experience of past generations, which we receive in
      the shape of the great masterpieces of all ages. From time
      immemorial, man and humanity have followed all three paths.<br>
      <br>
      The first path to Truth, the path of the consciousness, is that
      followed by the great mystics. They consider that the
      consciousness is the most immediate reality for us and is the key
      to the universe. it is something which is in us, which is us. And
      throughout the ages the mystics have made the discovery that the
      laws of human consciousness contain an aspect not found in the
      laws governing the material universe.<br>
      <br>
      A certain dynamic unity exists in our consciousness, where one is
      at the same time many. it is possible for us to have
      simultaneously different thoughts, ideas, associations, images,
      memories and intuitions occupying our consciousness within
      fragments of a minute or a second, yet all this multiplicity will
      still constitute only a single dynamic unity. Therefore the laws
      of mathematics, which are valid for the material universe and are
      a key to its understanding, will not be valid in the field of
      consciousness, a realm where two and two do not necessarily make
      four. The mystics also found that measurements of space, time and
      weight, universally valid in nature and throughout the material
      universe, are not applicable to the consciousness, where sometimes
      a few seconds seem like hours, or hours like a minute.<br>
      <br>
      Our consciousness does not exist in space and therefore cannot be
      measured in spatial terms. It has its own time, which is very
      often timelessness, so temporal measurements cannot be applied to
      Truth reached by this path. The great mystics discovered that the
      human consciousness, besides being the most immediate and the
      inmost reality for us, is at the same time our closest source of
      energy, harmony and knowledge. The path to Truth leading to and
      through the consciousness produced the great teachings of
      humanity, the great intuitions and the great masterpieces
      throughout the ages. Such then is the first path to or source of
      Truth, as the Essene traditions understand and interpret it.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the magnificent original intuitions of the great
      masters often lose their vitality as they pass down the
      generations. They are very often modified, distorted and turned
      into dogmas, and all too frequently their values become petrified
      in institutions and organized hierarchies. The pure intuitions are
      choked by the sands of time, and eventually have to be dug out by
      seekers of Truth able to penetrate into their essence.<br>
      <br>
      Another danger is that persons following this path to Truth, the
      path of the consciousness - may fall into exaggerations. They come
      to think that this is the only path to Truth and disregard all
      others. Very often, too, they apply the specific laws of the human
      consciousness to the material universe where they lack validity,
      and ignore the laws proper to the latter sphere. The mystic often
      creates for himself an artificial universe, farther and farther
      removed from reality, till he ends by living in an ivory tower,
      having lost all contact with reality and life.<br>
      <br>
      The second of the three paths is the path of nature. While the
      first path of the consciousness starts from within and penetrates
      thence into the totality of things, the second path takes the
      opposite way. Its starting point is the external world. it is the
      path of the scientist, and has been followed in all ages through
      experience and through experiment, through the use of inductive
      and deductive methods.<br>
      <br>
      The scientist, working with exact quantitative measurements,
      measures everything in space and time, and makes all possible
      correlations.<br>
      <br>
      With his telescope he penetrates into far-distant cosmic space,
      into the various solar and galactic systems; through spectrum
      analysis he measures the constituents of the different planets in
      cosmic space; and by mathematical calculation he establishes in
      advance the movements of celestial bodies. Applying the law of
      cause and effect, the scientist establishes a long chain of causes
      and effects which help him to explain and measure the universe, as
      well as life.<br>
      <br>
      But the scientist, like the mystic, sometimes falls into
      exaggerations. While science has transformed the life of mankind
      and has created great values, for man in all ages, it has failed
      to give entire satisfaction in the solution of the final problems
      of existence, life and the universe. The scientist has the long
      chain of causes and effects secure in all its particles, but he
      has no idea what to do with the end of the chain. He has no solid
      point to which he may attach the end of the chain, and so by the
      path to Truth through nature and the material universe he is
      unable to answer the great and eternal questions concerning the
      beginning and end of all things.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest scientists recognize that in the metaphysical field
      beyond the scientific chain there is something else - continuing
      from the end of that chain. However, there are also the dogmatic
      scientists who deny any other approach to Truth than their own,
      who refuse to attribute reality to the facts and phenomena which
      they cannot fit neatly into their own categories and
      classifications.<br>
      <br>
      The path to Truth through nature is not that of the dogmatic
      scientist, just as the first path is not that of the one-sided
      mystic. Nature is a great open book in which everything can be
      found, if we learn to draw from it the inspiration which it has
      given to the great thinkers of all ages. if we learn her language,
      nature will reveal to us all the laws of life and the universe.<br>
      <br>
      It is for this reason that all the great masters of humanity from
      time to time withdrew into nature: Zarathustra and Moses into the
      mountains, Buddha to the forest, Jesus and the Essenes to the
      desert-and thus followed this second path as well as that of the
      consciousness. The two paths do not contradict one another, but
      harmoniously complete one another in full knowledge of the laws of
      both. It was thus that the great teachers reached wonderful and
      deeply profound truths which have given inspiration to millions
      through thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      The third path to Truth, is the wisdom, knowledge and experience
      acquired by the great thinkers of all ages and transmitted to us
      in the form of great teachings, the great sacred books or
      scriptures, and the great masterpieces of universal literature
      which together form what today we would call universal culture.<br>
      <br>
      In brief, therefore, our approach to Truth is a threefold one:
      through consciousness, nature and culture.<br>
      <br>
      In the following chapters we shall follow this threefold path
      leading to Truth and shall examine and translate some of the great
      sacred writings of the Essenes.<br>
      <br>
      There are different ways of studying these great writings. One
      way-the way of all theologians and of the organized Churches-is to
      consider each text literally. This is the dogmatic way resulting
      from a long process of petrification, by which truths are
      inevitably transformed into dogmas.<br>
      <br>
      When the theologian follows this most easy but one-sided path, he
      runs into endless contradictions and complications, and he reaches
      a conclusion as far removed from the truth as that of the
      scientific interpreter of these texts who rejects them as entirely
      valueless and without validity. The approaches of the dogmatic
      theologian and the exclusivist scientist represent two extremes.<br>
      <br>
      A third error is to believe, as do certain symbolists, that these
      books have no more than a symbolic content and are nothing more
      than parables. With their own particular way of exaggeration these
      symbolists make thousands of different and quite contradictory
      interpretations of these great texts.<br>
      <br>
      The spirit of the Essene traditions is opposed to all three of
      these ways of interpreting these ageless writings and follows an
      entirely different approach.<br>
      <br>
      The Essene method of interpretation of these books is, on the one
      hand, to place them in harmonious correlation with the laws of the
      human consciousness and of nature, and, on the other, to consider
      the facts and circumstances of the age and environment in which
      they were written. This approach also takes into account the
      degree of evolution and understanding of the people to whom the
      particular master was addressing his message.<br>
      <br>
      Since all the great masters had to adapt their teaching to the
      level of their audience, they found it necessary to formulate both
      an exoteric and esoteric teaching. The exoteric message was one
      comprehensible to the people at large and was expressed in terms
      of various rules, forms and rituals corresponding to the basic
      needs of the people and the age concerned. Parallel with this, the
      esoteric teachings have survived through the ages partly as
      written and partly as unwritten living traditions, free from
      forms, rituals, rules and dogmas, and in all periods have been
      kept alive and practiced by a small minority.<br>
      <br>
      It is in this spirit of the interpretation of the Truth that the
      Essene Gospel of Peace will be translated in the following pages.
      Rejecting the dogmatic methods of literal and purely scientific
      interpretation as well as the exaggeration of the symbolists, we
      shall try to translate the Essene Gospel of Peace in the light of
      our consciousness and of nature, and in harmony with the great
      traditions of the Essenes, to whose brotherhood the authors of the
      Dead Sea Scrolls themselves belonged.<br>

      <br>
      And Mount Sinai was altogether in smoke because the Lord descended
      upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a
      furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.<br>
      <br>
      And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
      and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount: and Moses
      went up.<br>
      <br>
      And the Lord called unto Moses out of the mountain, saying, Come
      unto me, for I would give thee the Law for thy people, which shall
      be a covenant for the Children of Light.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses went up unto God. And God spake all these words, saying,<br>
      <br>
      I am the Law, thy God, which hath brought thee out from the depths
      of the bondage of darkness.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt have no other Laws before me.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not make unto thee any image of the Law in heaven above
      or in the earth beneath. I am the invisible Law, without beginning
      and without end.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not make unto thee false laws, for I am the Law, and
      the whole Law of all laws. If thou forsake me, thou shalt be
      visited by disasters for generation upon generation.<br>
      <br>
      If thou keepest my commandments, thou shalt enter the Inftnite
      Garden where stands the Tree of Life in the midst of the Eternal
      Sea.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not violate the Law. The Law is thy God, who shall not
      hold thee guiltless.<br>
      <br>
      Honor thy Earthly Mother, that thy days may be long upon the land,
      and honor thy Heavenly Father, that eternal life be thine in the
      heavens, for the earth and the heavens are given unto thee by the
      Law, which is thy God.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet thy Earthly Mother on the morning of the Sabbath.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Earth on the second morning.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Life on the third morning.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Joy on the fourth morning.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Sun on the fifth morning.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Water on the sixth morning,<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt greet the Angel of Air on the seventh morning-<br>
      <br>
      All these Angels of the Earthly Mother shalt thou greet, and
      consecrate thyself to them, that thou mayest enter the Infinite
      Garden where stands the Tree of Life.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt worship thy Heavenly Father on the evening of the
      Sabbath.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt commune with the Angel of Eternal Life on the second
      evening.<br>
      <br>
      T'hou shalt commune with the Angel of Work on the third evening.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt commune with the Angel of Peace on the fourth evening.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt commune with the Angel of Power on the fifth evening,<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt commune with the Angel of Love on the sixth evening.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt commune with the Angel of Wisdom on the seventh
      evening.<br>
      <br>
      All these Angels of the Heavenly Father shalt thou commune with,
      that thy soul may bathe in the Fountain of Light, and enter into
      the Sea of Eternity.<br>
      <br>
      The seventh day is the Sabbath: thou shalt remember it, keep it
      holy. The Sabbath is the day of the Light of the Law, thy God. In
      it thou shalt not do any work, but search the Light, the Kingdom
      of thy God, and all things shall be given unto thee.<br>
      <br>
      For know ye that during six days thou shalt work with the Angels,
      but the seventh day shalt thou dwell in the Light of thy Lord, who
      is the holy Law.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not take the life from any living thing. Life comes
      only from God, who giveth it and taketh it away.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not debase Love. It is the sacred gift of thy Heavenly
      Father.<br>
      <br>
      Thou Shalt not trade thy Soul, the priceless gift of the loving
      God, for the riches of the world, which are as seeds sown on stony
      ground, having no root in themselves, and so enduring but for a
      little while.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not be a false witness of the Law, to use it against
      thy brother: Only God knoweth the beginning and the ending of all
      things, for his eye is single, and he is the holy Law.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's possessions. The Law giveth
      unto thee much greater gifts, even the earth and the heavens, if
      thou keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses heard the voice of the Lord, and sealed within him the
      covenant that was between the Lord and the Children of Light.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
      tablets of the Law were in his hand.<br>
      <br>
      And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the
      writing of God, graven upon the tablets.<br>
      <br>
      And the people knew not what became of Moses, and they gathered
      themselves together and brake off their golden earrings and made a
      molten calf. And they worshipped unto the idol, and offered to it
      burnt offerings.<br>
      <br>
      And they ate and drank and danced before the golden calf, which
      they had made, and they abandoned themselves to corruption and
      evil before the Lord.<br>
      <br>
      And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that
      he saw the calf, and the dancing, and the wickedness of the
      people: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of
      his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.<br>
      <br>
      And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
      people, Ye have sinned a great sin, ye have denied thy Creator. I
      will go up unto the Lord and plead atonement for thy sin.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, thou hast seen
      the desecration of thy Holy Law. For thy children lost faith, and
      worshipped the darkness, and made for themselves a golden calf.
      Lord, forgive them, for they are blind to the light.<br>
      <br>
      And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, at the beginning of time was
      a covenant made between God and man, and the holy flame of the
      Creator did enter unto him. And he was made the son of God, and it
      was given him to guard his inheritance of the firstborn, and to
      make fruitful the land of his Father and keep it holy. And he who
      casteth out the Creator from him doth spit upon his birthright,
      and no more grievous sin doth exist in the eyes of God.<br>
      <br>
      And the Lord spoke, saying, Only the Children of Light can keep
      the Commandments of the Law. Hear me, for I say thus: the tablets
      which thou didst break, these shall nevermore be written in the
      words of men. As thou didst return them to the earth and fire, so
      shall they live, invisible, in the hearts of those who are able to
      follow their Law. To thy people of little faith, who did sin
      against the Creator, even whilst thou stood on holy ground before
      thy God, -I will give another Law. It shall be a stem law, yea, it
      shall bind them, for they know not yet the Kingdom of Light.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses hid the invisible Law within his breast, and kept it for
      a sign to the Children of Light. And God gave unto Moses the
      written law for the people, and he went down unto them, and spake
      unto them with a heavy heart.<br>
      <br>
      And Moses said unto the people, these are the laws which thy God
      hath given thee.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt have no other gods before me. <br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. <br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. <br>
      <br>
      Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <br>
      <br>
      Honor thy father and thy mother.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not kill.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not steal.<br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. <br>
      <br>
      Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, nor thy neighbor's
      wife, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.<br>
      <br>
      And there was a day of mourning and atonement for the great sin
      against the Creator, which did not end. And the broken tablets of
      the Invisible Law lived hidden in the breast of Moses, until it
      came to pass that the Children of Light appeared in the desert,
      and the angels walked the earth.<br>

      <br>
      And it was by the bed of a stream, that the weary and afflicted
      came again to seek out Jesus. And like children, they had
      forgotten the Law; and like children, they sought out their father
      to show them where they had erred, and to set their feet again
      upon the path. And when the sun rose over the earth's rim they saw
      Jesus coming toward them from the mountain, with the brightness of
      the rising sun about his head.<br>
      <br>
      And he raised his hand and smiled upon them, saying, "Peace be
      with you."<br>
      <br>
      But they were ashamed to return his greeting, for each in his own
      way had turned his back on the holy teachings, and the Angels of
      the Earthly Mother and the Heavenly Father were not with them. And
      one man looked up in anguish and spoke: "Master, we are in sore
      need of your wisdom. For we know that which is good, and yet we
      follow evil. We know that to enter the kingdom of heaven we must
      walk with the angels of the day and of the night, yet our feet
      walk in the ways of the wicked. The light of day shines only on
      our pursuit of pleasure, and the night falls on our heedless
      stupor. Tell us, Master, how may we talk with the angels, and stay
      within their holy circle, that the Law may burn in our hearts with
      a constant flame?"<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus spoke to them:<br>
      "To lift your eyes to heaven<br>
      When all mens' eyes are on the ground,<br>
      Is not easy.<br>
      To worship at the feet of the angels<br>
      When all men worship only fame and riches,<br>
      <br>
      Is not easy.<br>
      But the most difficult of all<br>
      Is to think the thoughts of the angels,<br>
      To speak the words of the angels,<br>
      And to do as angels do. "<br>
      <br>
      And one man spoke: "But, Master, we are but men, we are not
      angels. How then can we hope to walk in their ways? Tell us what
      we must do."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus spoke:<br>
      <br>
      "As the son inherits the land of his father,<br>
      So have we inherited a Holy Land<br>
      From our Fathers.<br>
      T'his land is not a field to be ploughed,<br>
      But a place within us<br>
      Where we may build our Holy Temple.<br>
      And even as a temple must be raised,<br>
      Stone by stone,<br>
      So will I give to you those stones<br>
      For the building of the Holy Temple;<br>
      That which we have inherited<br>
      From our Fathers,<br>
      And their Fathers' Fathers."<br>
      <br>
      And all the men gathered around Jesus, and their faces shone with
      desire to hear the words which would come from his lips. And he
      lifted his face to the rising sun, and the radiance of its rays
      filled his eyes as he spoke:<br>
      <br>
      "The Holy Temple can be built<br>
      Only with the ancient Communions,<br>
      Those which are spoken,<br>
      Those which are thought,<br>
      And those which are lived.<br>
      For if they are spoken only with the mouth,<br>
      They are as a dead hive<br>
      Which the bees have forsaken,<br>
      That gives no more honey.<br>
      Communions are a bridge<br>
      Between man and the angels,<br>
      And like a bridge,<br>
      Can be built only with patience,<br>
      Yea, even as the bridge over the river<br>
      Is fashioned stone by stone,<br>
      As they are found by the water's edge.<br>
      <br>
      And the Communions are fourteen in number<br>
      <br>
      As the Angels of the Heavenly Father<br>
      Number seven,<br>
      And the Angels of the Earthly Mother<br>
      Number seven.<br>
      And just as the roots of the tree<br>
      Sink into the earth and are nourished,<br>
      And the branches of the tree<br>
      Raise their arms to heaven,<br>
      So is man like the trunk of the tree,<br>
      With his roots deep<br>
      In the breast of his Earthly Mother,<br>
      And his soul ascending<br>
      To the bright stars of his Heavenly Father.<br>
      And the roots of the tree<br>
      Are the Angels of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And the branches of the tree<br>
      Are the Angels of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      And this is the sacred Tree of Life<br>
      Which stands in the Sea of Eternity.<br>
      <br>
      The first Communion is with the Angel of Sun<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Sun,<br>
      She who cometh each morning<br>
      As a bride from her chamber,<br>
      To shed her golden light on the world.<br>
      O thou immortal, shining, swift-steeded<br>
      Angel of the Sun!<br>
      There is no warmth without thee,<br>
      No fire without thee,<br>
      No life without thee.<br>
      As green leaves of the trees<br>
      Do worship thee,<br>
      And through thee is the tiny wheat kernel<br>
      Become a river of golden grass,<br>
      Moving with the wind.<br>
      Through thee is opened the flower<br>
      In the center of my body.<br>
      Therefore will I never hide myself<br>
      From thee.<br>
      Angel of Sun,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      Enter the holy temple within me<br>

      Who fills the dry well to overflowing.<br>

      Water of Life<br>
      From the heavenly sea<br>
      The waters run and flow forward<br>
      From the never-failing springs.<br>
      In my blood flow<br>
      A thousand pure springs,<br>
      And vapors, and clouds,<br>
      And all the waters<br>
      That spread over all the seven Kingdoms.<br>
      All the waters<br>
      The Creator hath made Are holy.<br>
      The voice of the Lord<br>
      Is upon the waters:<br>
      The God of Glory thundereth;<br>
      The Lord is upon many waters.<br>
      Angel of Water,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      Enter the blood that flows through me,<br>
      Wash my body in the rain<br>
      That falls from heaven,<br>
      And give me the Water of Life.<br>
      <br>
      The third Communion is with the Angel of Air<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Air,<br>
      Who spreads the perfume<br>
      Of sweet-smelling fields,<br>
      of spring grass after rain,<br>
      of the opening buds of the<br>
      Rose of Sharon.<br>
      We worship the Holy Breath<br>
      Which is placed higher<br>
      Than all the other things created.<br>
      For, lo, the eternal and sovereign Luminous space,<br>
      Where rule the unnumbered stars,<br>
      Is the air we breathe in<br>
      And the air we breathe out.<br>
      And in the moment betwixt the breathing in<br>
      And the breathing out<br>
      Is hidden all the mysteries of the Infinite Garden.<br>
      Angel of Air,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      Enter deep within me,<br>
      As the swallow plummets from the sky,<br>
      That I may know the secrets of the wind<br>
      And the music of the stars.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth Communion is with the Angel of Earth<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Earth,<br>
      She who brings forth corn and grapes<br>
      From the fulness of the earth,<br>
      She who brings children<br>
      From the loins of husband and wife.<br>
      He who would till the earth,<br>
      With the left arm and the right,<br>
      Unto him will she bring forth<br>
      An abundance of fruit and grain,<br>
      Golden-hued plants<br>
      Growing up from the earth<br>
      During the spring,<br>
      As far as the earth extends,<br>
      As far as the rivers stretch,<br>
      As far as the sun rises,<br>
      To impart their gifts of food unto men.<br>
      This wide earth do I praise,<br>
      Expanded far with paths,<br>
      The productive, the full-bearing,<br>
      Thy Mother, holy plant!<br>
      Yea, I praise the lands<br>
      Where thou dost grow<br>
      Sweet-scented swiftly spreading,<br>
      The good growth of the Lord.<br>
      He who sows corn, grass and fruit,<br>
      Soweth the Law.<br>
      And his harvest shall be bountiful,<br>
      And his crop shall be ripe upon the hills<br>
      As a reward for the followers of the Law,<br>
      The Lord sent the Angel of Earth,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother<br>
      To make the plants to grow,<br>
      And to make fertile the womb of woman,<br>

      The laughter of children.<br>

      <br>

      <br>
      The Angel of Life,<br>
      She who gives strength and vigor to man.<br>

      How then can the candle give a steady flame?<br>
      Go, then, toward the high-growing trees,<br>
      And before one of them which is beautiful,<br>
      High-growing and mighty,<br>
      Say these words:<br>
      'Hail be unto thee! O good, living tree,<br>
      Made by the Creator!'<br>
      Then shall the River of Life<br>
      Flow between you and your Brother,<br>
      The Tree,<br>
      And health of the body,<br>
      Swiftness of foot,<br>
      Quick hearing of the ears,<br>
      Strength of the arms<br>
      And eyesight of the eagle be yours.<br>
      Such is the Communion<br>
      With the Angel of Life,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother.<br>
      <br>
      The sixth Communion is with the Angel of Joy<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Joy,<br>
      She who descends upon earth<br>
      To give beauty to all men.<br>
      For the Lord is not worshipped with sadness,<br>
      Nor with cries of despair.<br>
      Leave off your moans and lamentations,<br>
      And sing unto the Lord a new song:<br>
      Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.<br>
      Let the heavens rejoice<br>
      And let the earth be glad.<br>
      Let the field be joyful,<br>

      The mountains and the hills<br>
      Shall break forth before you into singing.<br>
      Angel of Joy,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      I will sing unto the Lord<br>
      As long as I live:<br>
      I will sing praise to my God<br>
      While I have my being.<br>
      <br>
      The seventh Communion is with Our Earthly Mother<br>
      <br>
      Our Earthly Mother,<br>
      She who sends forth her Angels<br>
      To guide the roots of man<br>
      And send them deep into the blessed soil.<br>
      We invoke the Earthly Mother!<br>
      The Holy Preserver!<br>
      The Maintainer!<br>
      It is She who will restore the world!<br>
      The earth is hers,<br>
      And the fulness thereof the world,<br>
      And they that dwell therein.<br>
      We worship the good, the strong,<br>
      The beneficent Earthly Mother<br>
      And all her Angels,<br>
      Bounteous, valiant,<br>
      And full of strength;<br>
      Welfare-bestowing, kind,<br>
      And health-giving.<br>
      Through her brightness and glory<br>
      Do the plants grow up from the earth,<br>
      By the never-failing springs.<br>
      Through her brightness and glory<br>
      Do the winds blow,<br>
      Driving down the clouds<br>
      Towards the never-failing springs.<br>
      The Earthly Mother and I are One.<br>
      I have my roots in her,<br>
      And she takes her delight in me<br>
      According to the Holy Law. "<br>
      <br>
      Then there was a great silence, as the listeners pondered the
      words of Jesus. And there was new strength in them, and desire and
      hope shone in their faces. And then one man spoke: "Master, we are
      filled with eagerness to begin our Communions with the Angels of
      the Earthly Mother, who planted the Great Garden of the Earth. But
      what of the Angels of the Heavenly Father, who rule the night? How
      are we to talk to them, who are so far above us, who are invisible
      to our eyes? For we can see the rays of the sun, we can feel the
      cool water of the stream where we bathe, and the grapes are warm
      to our touch as they grow purple on the vines. But the Angels of
      the Heavenly Father cannot be seen, or heard, or touched. How then
      can we talk to them, and enter their Infinite Garden? Master, tell
      us what we must do."<br>
      <br>
      And the morning sun encircled his head with glory as Jesus looked
      upon them and spoke:<br>
      <br>
      "My children, know you not that the Earth<br>
      And all that dwells therein<br>
      Is but a reflection of the<br>
      Kingdom of the Heavenly Father?<br>
      And as you are suckled and comforted<br>
      By your mother when a child,<br>
      But go to join your father in the fields<br>
      When you grow up,<br>
      So do the Angels of the Earthly Mother<br>
      Guide your steps<br>
      Toward him who is your Father,<br>
      And all his holy Angels,<br>
      That you may know your true home<br>
      And become true Sons of God.<br>
      While we are children,<br>
      We will see the rays of the sun,<br>
      But not the Power which created it;<br>
      While we are children,<br>
      We will hear the sounds of the flowing brook,<br>
      But not the Love which created it;<br>
      While we are children,<br>
      We will see the stars,<br>
      But not the hand which scatters them<br>
      Through the sky,<br>
      As the farmer scatters his seed.<br>
      Only through the Communions<br>
      With the Angels of the Heavenly Father,<br>
      Will we learn to see the unseen,<br>
      To hear that which cannot be heard,<br>
      And to speak the unspoken word.<br>
      <br>
      The first Communion is with the Angel of Power<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Power,<br>
      Who fills the sun with heat,<br>
      And guides the hand of man<br>
      In all his works.<br>
      Thine, O Heavenly Father!<br>
      Was the Power,<br>
      When thou didst order a path<br>
      For each of us and all.<br>
      Through thy power<br>
      Will my feet tread the<br>
      Path of the Law;<br>
      Through thy power<br>
      Will my hands perform thy works.<br>
      May the golden river of power<br>
      Always flow from thee to me,<br>
      And may my body always turn unto thee,<br>
      As the flower turns unto the sun.<br>
      For there is no power save that<br>
      From the Heavenly Father;<br>
      All else is but a dream of dust,<br>
      A cloud passing over the face of the sun.<br>
      There is no man that hath power<br>
      Over the spirit;<br>
      Neither hath he power in the day of death.<br>
      Only that power which cometh from God<br>
      Can carry us out from the City of Death.<br>
      Guide our works and deeds,<br>
      O Angel of Power,<br>
      Holy messenger of the Heavenly -Father!<br>
      <br>
      The second Communion is with the Angel of Love<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Love,<br>
      Whose healing waters flow<br>
      In a never-ending stream<br>
      From the Sea of Eternity.<br>
      Beloved, let us love one another:<br>
      For love is of the Heavenly Father,<br>
      And every one that loveth<br>
      Is born of the Heavenly Order<br>
      And knoweth the Angels.<br>
      For without love,<br>
      A man's heart is parched and cracked<br>
      As the bottom of a dry well,<br>
      And his words are empty<br>
      As a hollow gourd.<br>
      But loving words are as a honeycomb<br>
      Sweet to the soul;<br>
      Loving words in a man's mouth<br>
      Are as deep waters,<br>
      And the wellspring of love<br>
      As a flowing brook.<br>
      Yea, it was said in the ancient of days,<br>
      Thou shalt love thy Heavenly Father<br>
      With all thy heart,<br>
      And with all thy mind,<br>
      And with all thy deeds,<br>
      And thou shalt love thy brothers<br>
      As thyself<br>
      The Heavenly Father is love;<br>
      And he that dwelleth in love<br>
      Dwelleth in the Heavenly Father,<br>
      And the Heavenly Father in him.<br>
      He that loveth not is as a wandering bird<br>
      Cast out of the nest;<br>
      For him the grass faileth<br>
      And the stream has a bitter taste.<br>
      And if a man say,<br>
      I love the Heavenly Father<br>
      But hate my brother,<br>
      He is a liar:<br>
      For he that loveth not his brother<br>
      Whom he hath seen,<br>
      How can he love the Heavenly Father<br>
      Whom he hath not seen?<br>
      By this we know the Children of Light:<br>
      Those who walk with the Angel of Love,<br>
      For they love the Heavenly Father,<br>
      And they love their brethren,<br>
      And they keep the Holy Law.<br>
      Love is stronger<br>
      Than the currents of deep waters:<br>
      Love is stronger than death.<br>
      <br>
      The third Communion is with the Angel of Wisdom<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Wisdom,<br>
      Who maketh man free from fear,<br>
      Wise of heart,<br>
      And easy of conscience:<br>
      Holy Wisdom,<br>
      The Understanding that unfolds,<br>
      Continuously,<br>
      As a holy scroll,<br>
      Yet does not come through learning.<br>
      All wisdom cometh<br>
      From the Heavenly Father,<br>
      And is with him for ever.<br>
      Who can number the sand of the sea,<br>
      And the drops of rain,<br>
      And the days of eternity?<br>
      Who can find out the height of heaven,<br>
      And the breadth of the earth?<br>
      Who can tell the beginning<br>
      Of wisdom?<br>
      Wisdom hath been created<br>
      Before all things.<br>
      He who is with out wisdom<br>
      Is like unto him that saith to the wood,<br>
      'Awake', and to the dumb stone,<br>
      'Arise, and teach!'<br>
      So are his words empty,<br>
      And his deeds harmful,<br>
      As a child who brandishes his father's sword<br>
      And knoweth not its cutting edge.<br>
      But the crown of wisdom<br>
      Makes peace and perfect health<br>
      To flourish,<br>
      Both of which are the gifts of God.<br>
      O thou Heavenly Order!<br>
      And thou, Angel of Wisdom!<br>
      I will worship thee and<br>
      The Heavenly Father,<br>
      Because of whom<br>
      The river of thought within us<br>
      Is flowing towards the<br>
      Holy Sea of Eternity.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth Communion is with the Angel of Eternal Life<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Eternal Life,<br>
      Who brings the message of eternity<br>
      To man.<br>
      For he who walks with the Angels<br>
      Shall learn to soar<br>
      Above the clouds,<br>
      And his home shall be<br>
      In the Eternal Sea<br>
      Where stands the sacred Tree of Life.<br>
      Do not wait for death<br>
      To reveal the great mystery;<br>
      If you know not your Heavenly Father<br>
      While your feet tread the dusty soil,<br>
      There shall be naught but shadows for thee<br>
      In the life that is to come.<br>
      Here and now<br>
      Is the mystery revealed.<br>
      Here and now<br>
      Is the curtain lifted.<br>
      Be not afraid, O man!<br>
      Lay hold of the wings of the<br>
      Angel of Eternal Life,<br>
      And soar into the paths of the stars,<br>
      The moon, the sun,<br>
      And the endless Light,<br>
      Moving around in their<br>
      Revolving circle forever,<br>
      And fly toward the Heavenly Sea Of Eternal Life.<br>
      <br>
      The fifth Communion is with the Angel of Work<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Work,<br>
      Who sings in the humming of the bee,<br>
      Pausing not in its making of golden honey;<br>
      In the flute of the shepherd,<br>
      Who sleeps not lest his flock go astray;<br>
      In the song of the maiden<br>
      As she lays her hand to the spindle.<br>
      And if you think that these<br>
      Are not as fair in the eyes of the Lord<br>
      As the loftiest of prayers<br>
      Echoed from the highest mountain,<br>
      Then you do indeed err.<br>
      For the honest work of humble hands<br>
      Is a daily prayer of thanksgiving,<br>
      And the music of the plough<br>
      Is a joyful song unto the Lord.<br>
      He who eats the bread of idleness<br>
      Must die of hunger,<br>
      For a field of stones<br>
      Can yield only stones.<br>
      For him is the day without meaning,<br>
      And the night a bitter journey of evil dreams.<br>
      The mind of the idle<br>
      Is full of the weeds of discontent;<br>
      But he who walks with the<br>
      Angel of Work<br>
      Has within him a field always fertile,<br>
      Where corn and grapes<br>
      And all manner of sweet-scented<br>
      Herbs and flowers grow in abundance.<br>
      As ye sow, so shall ye reap.<br>
      The man of God who has found his task<br>
      Shall not ask any other blessing.<br>
      <br>
      The sixth Communion is with the Angel of Peace<br>
      <br>
      The Angel of Peace,<br>
      Whose kiss bestoweth calm,<br>
      And whose face is as the surface<br>
      Of untroubled waters,<br>
      Wherein the moon is reflected.<br>
      I will invoke Peace,<br>
      Whose breath is friendly,<br>
      Whose hand smooths the troubled brow.<br>
      In the reign of Peace,<br>
      There is neither hunger nor thirst,<br>
      Neither cold wind nor hot wind,<br>
      Neither old age nor death.<br>
      But to him that hath not peace in his soul,<br>
      There is no place to build within<br>
      The Holy Temple;<br>
      For how can the carpenter build<br>
      In the midst Of a whirlwind?<br>
      The seed of violence can reap<br>
      Only a harvest of desolation,<br>
      And from the parched clay<br>
      Can grow no living thing.<br>
      Seek ye then the Angel of Peace,<br>
      Who is as the morning star<br>
      In the midst of a cloud,<br>
      As the moon at the full,<br>
      As a fair olive tree budding forth fruit,<br>
      And as the sun shining on the temple<br>
      Of the most High.<br>
      Peace dwells in the heart of silence:<br>
      Be still, and know that I am God.<br>
      <br>
      The seventh Communion is with the Heavenly Father<br>
      <br>
      The Heavenly Father,<br>
      Who is,<br>
      Who was, and<br>
      Who ever shall be.<br>
      O Great Creator!<br>
      Thou didst create the Heavenly Angels,<br>
      And thou didst reveal the<br>
      Heavenly Laws!<br>
      Thou art my refuge and my fortress,<br>
      Thou art from everlasting.<br>
      Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place<br>
      In all generations.<br>
      Before the mountains were brought forth,<br>
      Or ever thou hadst formed the earth,<br>
      Even from everlasting to everlasting,<br>
      Thou art God.<br>
      Who hath made the waters,<br>
      And who maketh the plants?<br>
      Who to the wind<br>
      I Hath yoked the storm-clouds,<br>
      The swift and even the fleetest?<br>
      Who, O Great Creator!<br>
      Is the fountain of Eternal Life<br>
      Within our souls?<br>
      Who hath made the Light and the Darkness?<br>
      Who hath made sleep<br>
      And the zest of the waking hours?<br>
      Who spread the noontides<br>
      And the midnight? Thou,<br>
      O Great Creator!<br>
      Thou hast made the earth By thy power,<br>
      Hath established the world By thy wisdom,<br>
      And hath stretched out the heavens By thy love.<br>
      Do thou reveal unto me, O Heavenly Father,<br>
      Thy nature,<br>
      Which is the power of the<br>
      Angels of thy Holy Kingdom.<br>
      Immortality and the Heavenly order<br>
      Hast thou given, O Creator,<br>
      And the best of all things, Thy Holy Law!<br>
      I will praise thy works<br>
      With songs of thanksgiving,<br>
      Continually,<br>
      In all the generations of time.<br>
      With the coming of day<br>
      I embrace my Mother,<br>
      With the coming of night,<br>
      I join my Father,<br>
      And with the outgoing<br>
      Of evening and morning<br>
      I will breathe Their Law,<br>
      And I will not interrupt these Communions Until the end of time "<br>
      <br>
      And over heaven and earth was a great silence, and the peace of
      the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother shone over the heads of
      Jesus and the multitude.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>FROM THE ESSENE BOOK OF JESUS</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>THE SEVENFOLD PEACE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      And seeing the multitudes, Jesus went up into a mountain, and his
      disciples came unto him, and all those who hungered for his words.
      And seeing them gathered, he opened his mouth and taught them,
      saying:<br>
      <br>
      "Peace I bring to thee, my children,<br>
      The Sevenfold Peace<br>
      Of the Earthly Mother<br>
      And the Heavenly Father.<br>
      Peace I bring to thy body,<br>
      Guided by the Angel of Power; Peace I bring to thy heart,<br>
      Guided by the Angel of Love; Peace I bring to thy mind,<br>
      Guided by the Angel of Wisdom. Through the Angels of<br>
      Power, Love and Wisdom,<br>
      Thou shalt travel the Seven Paths<br>
      Of the Infinite Garden,<br>
      And thy body, thy heart and thy mind<br>
      Shall join in Oneness<br>
      In the Sacred Flight to the Heavenly Sea of Peace.<br>
      <br>
      Yea, I tell thee truly,<br>
      The paths are seven<br>
      Through the Infinite Garden,<br>
      And each must be traversed<br>
      By the body, the heart and the mind As one,<br>
      Lest thou stumble and fall<br>
      Into the abyss of emptiness.<br>
      For as a bird cannot fly with one wing,<br>
      So doth thy Bird of Wisdom<br>
      Need two wings of Power and Love<br>
      To soar above the abyss<br>
      To the Holy Tree of Life.<br>
      <br>
      For the body alone<br>
      Is an abandoned house seen from afar:<br>
      What was thought beautiful<br>
      Is but ruin and desolation<br>
      When drawing near.<br>
      Are body alone<br>
      Is as a chariot fashioned from gold,<br>
      Whose maker sets it on a pedestal,<br>
      Loath to soil it with use.<br>
      But as a golden idol,<br>
      It is ugly and without grace,<br>
      For only in movement<br>
      Doth it reveal its purpose.<br>
      Like the hollow blackness of a window<br>
      When the wind puts out its candle,<br>
      Is the body alone,<br>
      With no heart and no mind<br>
      To fill it with light.<br>
      <br>
      And the heart alone<br>
      is a sun with no earth to shine upon,<br>
      A light in the void,<br>
      A ball of warmth drowned<br>
      In a sea of blackness.<br>
      For when a man doth love,<br>
      That love turneth only to<br>
      Its own destruction<br>
      When there is no hand to stretch forth<br>
      In good works,<br>
      And no mind to weave the flames of desire<br>
      Into a tapestry of psalms.<br>
      Like a whirlwind in the desert<br>
      Is the heart alone,<br>
      With no body and no mind<br>
      To lead it singing<br>
      through the cypress and the pine.<br>
      And the mind alone<br>
      Is a holy scroll<br>
      Which has worn thin with the years,<br>
      And must be buried.<br>
      The truth and beauty of its words<br>
      Have not changed,<br>
      But the eyes can no longer read the faded letters,<br>
      And it falleth to pieces in the hands.<br>
      So is the mind without the heart<br>
      To give it words,<br>
      And without the body<br>
      To do its deeds.<br>
      For what availeth wisdom<br>
      Without a heart to feel<br>
      And a tongue to give it voice?<br>
      Barren as the womb of an aged woman<br>
      Is the mind alone,<br>
      With no heart and no body To fill it with life.<br>
      <br>
      For, lo, I tell thee truly,<br>
      The body and the heart and the mind<br>
      Are as a chariot, and a horse, and a driver.<br>
      The chariot is the body,<br>
      Forged in strength to do the will<br>
      of the Heavenly Father<br>
      And the Earthly Mother.<br>
      The heart is the fiery steed,<br>
      Glorious and courageous,<br>
      Who carries the chariot bravely,<br>
      Whether the road be smooth,<br>
      Or whether stones and fallen trees<br>
      Lie in its path.<br>
      And the driver is the mind,<br>
      Holding the reins of wisdom,<br>
      Seeing from above what lieth<br>
      On the far horizon,<br>
      Charting the course of hoofs and wheels.<br>
      Give ear, O ye heavens,<br>
      And I will speak;<br>
      And hear, O earth,<br>
      The words of my mouth.<br>
      My doctrine shall drop as the rain,<br>
      My speech shall distil as the dew,<br>
      As the small rain<br>
      Upon the tender herb,<br>
      And as the showers upon the grass.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who is strong in body,<br>
      For he shall have oneness with the earth.<br>
      Thou shalt celebrate a daily feast<br>
      With all the gifts of the Angel of Earth:<br>
      The golden wheat and corn,<br>
      The purple grapes of autumn,<br>
      The ripe fruits of the trees,<br>
      The amber honey of the bees.<br>
      Thou shalt seek the fresh air<br>
      of the forest and of the fields,<br>
      And there in the midst of them<br>
      Shalt thou find the Angel of Air.<br>
      Put off thy shoes and clothing<br>
      And suffer the Angel of Air<br>
      To embrace all thy body.<br>
      Then shalt thou breathe long and deeply,<br>
      That the Angel of Air<br>
      May be brought within thee.<br>
      Enter into the cool and flowing river<br>
      And suffer the Angel of Water<br>
      To embrace all thy body.<br>
      Cast thyself wholly into his enfolding arms,<br>
      And as often as thou movest the air with thy breath,<br>
      Move with thy body the water also.<br>
      Thou shalt seek the Angel of Sun,<br>
      And enter into that embrace<br>
      Which doth purify with holy flames.<br>
      And all these things are of the<br>
      Holy Law of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      She who did give thee birth.<br>
      He who hath found peace with the body<br>
      Hath built a holy temple<br>
      Wherein may dwellforever<br>
      The spirit of God.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who is wise in mind,<br>
      For he shall create heaven.<br>
      The mind of the wise<br>
      Is a well-ploughed field,<br>
      Which giveth forth abundance and plenty.<br>
      For it thou showest a handful of seed<br>
      To a wise man,<br>
      He will see in his mind's eye<br>
      A field of golden wheat.<br>
      And if thou showest a handful of seed<br>
      To a fool,<br>
      He will see only that which is before him,<br>
      And call them worthless pebbles.<br>
      And as the field of the wise man<br>
      Giveth forth grain in abundance,<br>
      And the field of the fool<br>
      Is a harvest only of stones,<br>
      So it is with our thoughts.<br>
      As the sheaf of golden wheat<br>
      Lieth hidden within the tiny kernel,<br>
      So is the kingdom of heaven<br>
      Hidden within our thoughts.<br>
      If they be filled with the<br>
      Power, Love and Wisdom<br>
      of the Angels of the Heavenly Father,<br>
      So they shall carry us<br>
      To the Heavenly Sea.<br>
      But if they be stained<br>
      With corruption, hatred and ignorance,<br>
      They shall chain our feet<br>
      To pillars of pain and suffering.<br>
      No man can serve two masters;<br>
      Neither can evil thoughts abide in a mind<br>
      Filled with the Light of the Law.<br>
      He who hath found peace with the rnind<br>
      Hath leamed to soar beyond<br>
      The Realm of the Angels.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who is pure in heart,<br>
      For he shall see God.<br>
      For as the Heavenly Father hath given thee<br>
      His holy spirit,<br>
      And thy Earthly Mother hath given thee<br>
      Her holy body,<br>
      So shall ye give love<br>
      To all thy brothers.<br>
      And thy true brothers are all those<br>
      Who do the will of thy Heavenly Father<br>
      And thy Earthly Mother.<br>
      Let thy love be as the sun<br>
      Which shines on all the creatures of the earth,<br>
      And does not favor one blade of grass<br>
      For another.<br>
      And this love shall flow as a fountain<br>
      From brother to brother,<br>
      And as it is spent,<br>
      So shall it be replenished.<br>
      For love is eternal.<br>
      Love is stronger<br>
      Than the currents of deep waters.<br>
      Love is stronger than death.<br>
      And if a man hath not love,<br>
      He doth build a wall between him<br>
      And all the creatures of the earth,<br>
      And therein doth he dwell<br>
      In loneliness and pain.<br>
      Or he may become as an angry whirlpool<br>
      Which sucks into its depths<br>
      All that floats too near.<br>
      For the heart is a sea with mighty waves,<br>
      And love and wisdom must temper it,<br>
      As the warm sun breaks through the clouds<br>
      And quiets the restless sea.<br>
      He who hath found peace with his brothers<br>
      Hath entered the kingdom of Love,<br>
      And shall see God face to face.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who doth build on earth<br>
      The kingdom of heaven,<br>
      For he shall dwell in both worlds.<br>
      Thou shalt follow the Law of the Brotherhood,<br>
      Which saith that none shall have wealth,<br>
      And none shall be poor,<br>
      And all shall work together<br>
      In the garden of the Brotherhood.<br>
      Yet each shall follow his own path,<br>
      And each shall commune with his own heart.<br>
      For in the Infinite Garden<br>
      There are many and diverse flowers:<br>
      Who shall say that one is best<br>
      Because its color is purple,<br>
      Or that one is favored<br>
      Because its stalk is long and slender?<br>
      Though the brothers<br>
      Be of different complexion,<br>
      Yet do they all toil<br>
      In the vineyard of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And they all do lift their voices together<br>
      In praise of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      And together they break the holy bread,<br>
      And in silence share the holy meal<br>
      Of thanksgiving.<br>
      There shall be no peace among peoples<br>
      Til there be one garden of the brotherhood<br>
      Over the earth.<br>
      For how can there be peace<br>
      When each man pursueth his own gain<br>
      And doth sell his soul into slavery?<br>
      Thou, Child of Light,<br>
      Do ye gather with thy brothers<br>
      And then go ye forth<br>
      To teach the ways of the Law<br>
      To those who would hear.<br>
      He who hath found peace<br>
      With the brotherhood of man<br>
      Hath made himself<br>
      The co-worker of God<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who doth study the Book of the Law,<br>
      For he shall be as a candle<br>
      In the dark of night,<br>
      And an island of truth<br>
      In a sea of falsehood<br>
      For know ye, that the written word<br>
      Which cometh from God<br>
      Is a reflection of the Heavenly Sea,<br>
      Even as the bright stars<br>
      Reflect the face of heaven.<br>
      As the words of the Ancient Ones<br>
      Are etched with the hand of God<br>
      On the Holy Scrolls,<br>
      So is the Law engraved on the hearts of the faithful who do study
      them.<br>
      For it was said Of old,<br>
      That in the beginning there were giants<br>
      In the earth,<br>
      And mighty men which were of old,<br>
      Men Of renown.<br>
      And the Children of Light<br>
      Shall guard and preserve<br>
      Their written word,<br>
      Lest we become again as beasts,<br>
      And know not the Kingdom of the Angels.<br>
      Know ye, too,<br>
      That only through the written word<br>
      shalt thou find that Law<br>
      Which is unwritten,<br>
      As the spring which floweth from the ground<br>
      Hath a hidden source in the secret depths beneath the earth<br>
      The written Law<br>
      Is the instrument by which<br>
      The unwritten Law is understood,<br>
      As the mute branch of a tree<br>
      Becomes a singing flute<br>
      In the hands of the shepherd.<br>
      Many there are<br>
      Who would stay in the tranquil<br>
      Valley of ignorance,<br>
      Where children play<br>
      And butterflies dance in the sun<br>
      For their short hour of life.<br>
      But none can tarry there long,<br>
      And ahead rise the somber<br>
      Mountains of learning.<br>
      Many there are<br>
      Who fear to cross,<br>
      And many there are<br>
      Who have fallen bruised and bleeding<br>
      From their steep and rugged slopes.<br>
      But faith is the guide<br>
      Over the gaping chasm,<br>
      And perseverance the foothold In the jagged rocks.<br>
      Beyond the icy peaks of struggle<br>
      Lies the peace and beauty<br>
      Of the Infinite Garden of Knowledge,<br>
      Where the meaning of the Law<br>
      Is made known to the Children of Light.<br>
      Here in the center of its forest<br>
      Stands the Tree of Life<br>
      Mystery of mysteries.<br>
      He who hath found peace<br>
      With the teachings of the Ancients,<br>
      Through the light of the mind,<br>
      Through the light of nature,<br>
      And through the study of the Holy Word,<br>
      Hath entered the cloud-filled<br>
      Hall of the Ancients,<br>
      Where dwelleth the Holy Brotherhood,<br>
      of whom no man may speak.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body.<br>
      <br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who knoweth his Earthly Mother,<br>
      For she is the giver of life.<br>
      Know that thy Mother is in thee,<br>
      And thou art in her.<br>
      She bore thee<br>
      And she giveth thee life.<br>
      She it was who gaveth thee thy body,<br>
      And to her shalt thou one day<br>
      Give it back again.<br>
      Know that the blood which runs in thee<br>
      is born of the blood<br>
      Of thy Earthly Mother.<br>
      Her blood falls from the clouds,<br>
      Leaps up from the womb of the earth,<br>
      Babbles in the brooks of the mountains,<br>
      Flows wide in the rivers of the plains,<br>
      Sleeps in the lakes,<br>
      Rages mightily in the tempestuous seas.<br>
      Know that the air which thou dost breathe<br>
      Is born of the breath<br>
      Of thy Earthly Mother.<br>
      Her breath is azure<br>
      In the heights of the heavens,<br>
      Soughs in the tops of the mountains,<br>
      Whispers in the leaves of the forest,<br>
      Billows over the cornfields,<br>
      Slumbers in the deep valleys,<br>
      Bums hot in the desert.<br>
      Know that the hardness of thy bones<br>
      Is born of the bones<br>
      Of thy Earthly Mother,<br>
      Of the rocks and of the stones.<br>
      Know that the tenderness of thy flesh<br>
      Is born of the flesh<br>
      Of thy Earthly Mother,<br>
      She whose flesh waxeth yellow and red<br>
      In the fruits of the trees.<br>
      The light of thy eyes,<br>
      The hearing of thy ears,<br>
      These are born<br>
      Of the colors and the sounds<br>
      Of thy Earthly Mother,<br>
      Which doth enclose thee about,<br>
      As the waves of the sea enclose a fish,<br>
      As the eddying air a bird.<br>
      I tell thee in truth,<br>
      Man is the Son<br>
      Of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And from her did the Son of Man<br>
      Receive his whole body,<br>
      Even as the body of the newborn babe<br>
      Is born of the womb of his mother.<br>
      I tell thee truly,<br>
      Thou art one with the Earthly Mother;<br>
      She is in thee, and thou art in her.<br>
      Of her wert thou born,<br>
      In her dost thou live,<br>
      And to her shalt thou return again.<br>
      Keep, therefore, her laws,<br>
      For none can live long,<br>
      Neither be happy,<br>
      But he who honors his Earthly Mother<br>
      And keepeth her laws.<br>
      For thy breath is her breath,<br>
      Thy blood her blood,<br>
      Thy bone her bone,<br>
      Thy flesh her flesh,<br>
      Thy eyes and thy ears<br>
      Are her eyes and her ears.<br>
      He who hath found peace<br>
      With his Earthly Mother<br>
      Shall never know death.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Blessed is the Child of Light<br>
      Who doth seek his Heavenly Father,<br>
      For he shall have eternal life.<br>
      He that dwelleth in the secret place<br>
      Of the Most High<br>
      Shall abide under the shadow<br>
      of the Almighty.<br>
      For he shall give his Angels charge over thee,<br>
      To keep thee in all thy ways.<br>
      Know ye that the Lord hath been<br>
      Our dwelling place<br>
      In all generations.<br>
      Before the mountains were brought forth,<br>
      Or ever he had formed<br>
      The earth and the world,<br>
      Even from everlasting to everlasting,<br>
      Hath there been love<br>
      Between the Heavenly Father<br>
      And his children.<br>
      And how shall this love be severed?<br>
      From the beginning<br>
      Until the ending of time<br>
      Doth the holy flame of love<br>
      Encircle the heads<br>
      Of the Heavenly Father<br>
      And the Children of Light:<br>
      How then shall this love be extinguished?<br>
      Ye that love thy Heavenly Father,<br>
      Do ye then his bidding:<br>
      Walk ye with his Holy Angels,<br>
      And find thy peace with his Holy Law.<br>
      For his Law is the entire Law:<br>
      Yea, it is the Law of laws.<br>
      Through his Law he hath made<br>
      The earth and the heavens to be one;<br>
      The mountains and the sea<br>
      Are his footstools.<br>
      With his hands he hath made us<br>
      And fashioned us,<br>
      And he gaveth us understanding<br>
      That we may learn his Law.<br>
      He is covered with Light<br>
      As with a garment:<br>
      He stretcheth out the heavens<br>
      Like a curtain.<br>
      He maketh the clouds his chariot;<br>
      He walketh upon the wings of the wind.<br>
      He sendeth the springs into the valleys,<br>
      And his breath is in the mighty trees.<br>
      In his hand are the deep places of the earth:<br>
      The strength of the hills is his also.<br>
      The sea is his,<br>
      And his hands formed the dry land.<br>
      All the heavens declare the Glory of God,<br>
      And the firmament showeth his Law.<br>
      And to his children<br>
      Doth he bequeath his Kingdom,<br>
      To those who walk with his Angels,<br>
      And find their peace with his Holy Law.<br>
      Wouldst thou know more, my children?<br>
      How may we speak with our lips<br>
      That which cannot be spoken?<br>
      It is like a pomegranate eaten by a mute:<br>
      How then may he tell of its flavor?<br>
      If we say the Heavenly Father<br>
      Dwelleth within us,<br>
      Then are the heavens ashamed;<br>
      If we say he dwelleth without us,<br>
      It is falsehood.<br>
      The eye which scanneth the far horizon<br>
      And the eye which seeth the hearts of men<br>
      He maketh as one eye.<br>
      He is not manifest,<br>
      He is not hidden.<br>
      He is not revealed,<br>
      Nor is he unrevealed.<br>
      My children, there are no words<br>
      To tell that which he is!<br>
      Only this do we know:<br>
      We are his children,<br>
      And he is our Father.<br>
      He is our God,<br>
      And we are the children of his pasture,<br>
      And the sheep of his hand.<br>
      He who hath found peace<br>
      With his Heavenly Father<br>
      Hath entered the Sanctuary<br>
      of the Holy Law,<br>
      And hath made a covenant with God<br>
      Which shall endure forever.<br>
      Know this peace with thy mind,<br>
      Desire this peace with thy heart,<br>
      Fulfill this peace with thy body,<br>
      Though heaven and earth may pass away,<br>
      Not one letter of the Holy Law<br>
      Shall change or pass away.<br>
      For in the beginning was the Law,<br>
      And the Law was with God,<br>
      And the Law was God.<br>
      May the Sevenfold Peace<br>
      Of the Heavenly Father<br>
      Be with thee always. <br>

      Now we have proudly separated ourselves from Nature, and the
      spirit of Pan is dead. Men's souls are scattered beyond the hope
      of unity, and the sword of formal creeds sharply separates them
      everywhere. To live in harmony with the Universe made life the
      performance of a majestic ceremony; to live against it was to
      creep aside into a cul de sac. Yet, even now, whispers of change
      are stealing over the face of the world once more. Like another
      vast dream beginning, man's consciousness is slowly spreading
      outwards once again. Some voice from the long ago is divinely
      trumpeting across our little globe. To that voice, I dedicate this
      book. -- E.B.S.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>PREFACE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This third book of the Essene Gospel of Peace is a collection of
      texts of great spiritual, literary, philosophical and poetical
      value, created by two powerful, interwoven streams of tradition.<br>
      <br>
      Chronologically, the first is the stream of traditions to which
      the Hebrew people were exposed in the Babylonian prison, dating
      from the Gilgamesh Epics to the Zend Avesta of Zarathustra. The
      second is the stream of traditions flowing with poetical majesty
      through the Old and New Testaments, dating from the ageless Enoch
      and the other Patriarchs, through the Prophets and on to the
      mysterious Essene Brotherhood.<br>
      <br>
      In the buried library of the Essene Brotherhood at the Dead Sea,
      where the greatest number of scrolls were found, the texts of
      these two streams of traditions were very much interwoven. They
      follow each other in a strange succession: the powerful cubistic
      simplicity of the first juxtaposed with the majestic,
      expressionist poetry of the second.<br>
      <br>
      The original texts of this collection may be classified into three
      approximate groups: about seventy percent of them are completely
      different from the ancient Sacred Books of the Avestas and the Old
      and New Testaments; twenty percent are similar, and ten percent
      are identical.<br>
      <br>
      My desire in presenting this collection was to abstain from dry
      philological and exegetical interpretations, and instead to
      concentrate on their spiritual and poetical values, more
      attractive to twentieth century man. I tried to follow the style
      of my French translation of the first book of the Essene Gospel of
      Peace, which has now been published in seventeen languages, and
      has been distributed in over 200,000 copies.*<br>
      <br>
      I hope this Book Three will be as successful as Book One, and thus
      continue to bring these ageless inspirations to our disoriented
      century, guiding us, per secula seculorum, toward greater and
      greater light. -- EDMOND BORDEAUX SZEKELY<br>
      <br>
      * As of this printing in 1986, Book One of The Essene Gospel of
      Peace has been published in twenty-five languages, and distributed
      in over one million copies.<br>

      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      From the remote ages of antiquity a remarkable teaching has
      existed which is universal in its application and ageless in its
      wisdom. Fragments of it are found in Sumerian hieroglyphs and on
      tiles and stones dating back some eight or ten thousand years.
      Some of the symbols, such as for the sun, moon, air, water and
      other natural forces, are from an even earlier age preceding the
      cataclysm that ended the Pleistocene period. How many thousands of
      years previous to that the teaching existed is unknown.<br>
      <br>
      To study and practice this teaching is to reawaken within the
      heart of every man an intuitive knowledge that can solve his
      individual problems and the problems of the world.<br>
      <br>
      Traces of the teaching have appeared in almost every country and
      religion. Its fundamental principles were taught in ancient
      Persia, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, Palestine, Greece and many
      other countries. But it has been transmitted in its most pure form
      by the Essenes, that mysterious brotherhood which lived during the
      last two or three centuries B.C. and the first century of the
      Christian era at the Dead Sea in Palestine and at Lake Mareotis in
      Egypt. In Palestine and Syria the members of the brotherhood were
      known as Essenes and in Egypt as Therapeutae, or healers.<br>
      <br>
      The esoteric part of their teaching is given in the Tree of Life,
      the Essene Communions with the Angels, and the Sevenfold Peace,
      among others. The exoteric or outer teaching appears in Book One
      of "The Essene Gospel of Peace" and the recently discovered Dead
      Sea Scrolls.<br>
      <br>
      The origin of the brotherhood is said to be unknown, and the
      derivation of the name is uncertain. Some believe it comes from
      Esnoch, or Enoch, and claim him to be their founder, their
      Communions with the angelic world having first been given to him.<br>
      <br>
      Others consider the name comes from Esrael, the elects of the
      people to whom Moses brought forth the Communions at Mount Sinai
      where they were revealed to him by the angelic world.<br>
      <br>
      But whatever their origin, it is certain that the Essenes existed
      for a very long time as a brotherhood, perhaps under other names
      in other lands.The teaching appears in the Zend Avesta of
      Zarathustra, who translated it into a way of life that was
      followed for thousands of years. it contains the fundamental
      concepts of Brahmanism, the Vedas and the Upanishads; and the Yoga
      systems of India sprang from the same source. Buddha later gave
      forth essentially the same basic ideas and his sacred Bodhi tree
      is correlated with the Essene Tree of Life. In Tibet the teaching
      once more found expression in the Tibetan Wheel of Life.<br>
      <br>
      The Pythagoreans and Stoics in ancient Greece also followed the
      Essene principles and much of their way of life. The same teaching
      was an element of the Adonic culture of the Phoenicians, of the
      Alexandrian School of Philosophy in Egypt, and contributed greatly
      to many branches of Western culture, Freemasonry, Gnosticism, the
      Kabala and Christianity. Jesus interpreted it in its most sublime
      and beautiful form in the seven Beatitudes of the Sermon on the
      Mount.<br>
      <br>
      The Essenes lived on the shores of lakes and rivers, away from
      cities and towns, and practiced a communal way of life, sharing
      equally in everything. They were mainly agriculturists and
      arboriculturists, having a vast knowledge of crops, soil and
      climatic conditions which enabled them to grow a remarkable
      variety of fruits and vegetables in comparatively desert areas and
      with a minimum of labor.<br>
      <br>
      They had no servants or slaves and were said to have been the
      first people to condemn slavery both in theory and practice. There
      were no rich and no poor amongst them, both conditions being
      considered by them as deviations from the Law. They established
      their own economic system, based wholly on the Law, and showed
      that all man's food and material needs can be attained without
      struggle, through knowledge of the Law.<br>
      <br>
      They spent much time in study both of ancient writings and special
      branches of learning, such as education, healing and astronomy.
      They were said to be the heirs of Chaldean and Persian astronomy
      and the Egyptian arts of healing. They were adept in prophecy for
      which they prepared by prolonged fasting. in the use of plants and
      herbs for healing man and beast they were likewise proficient.<br>
      <br>
      They lived a simple regular life, rising each day before sunrise
      to study and commune with the forces of nature, bathing in cold
      water as a ritual and donning white garments. After their daily
      labor in the fields and vineyards they partook of their meals in
      silence, preceding and ending them with prayer. In their profound
      respect for all living things they never touched flesh foods, nor
      did they drink fermented liquids. Their evenings were devoted to
      study and communion with the heavenly forces.<br>
      <br>
      Evening was the beginning of their day, and their Sabbath, or holy
      day, began on Friday evening, the first day of their week. This
      day was given to study, discussion, the entertaining of visitors
      and the playing of certain musical instruments, relics of which
      have been discovered.<br>
      <br>
      Their way of life enabled them to live to advanced ages of 120
      years or more and they were said to have marvelous strength and
      endurance. In all their activities they expressed creative love.<br>
      <br>
      They sent out healers and teachers from the brotherhoods, amongst
      whom were Elijah, John the Baptist, John the Beloved and the great
      Essene Master, Jesus.<br>
      <br>
      Membership in the brotherhood was attainable only after a
      probationary period of a year and three years of initiatory work,
      followed by seven more years before being admitted to the full
      inner teaching.<br>
      <br>
      Records of the Essene way of life have come down to us from the
      writings of their contemporaries. Pliny the Roman naturalist,
      Philo the Alexandrian philosopher, Josephus the Roman historian,
      Solanius and others, spoke of them variously as "a race by
      themselves, more remarkable than any other in the world," "the
      oldest of the initiates, receiving their teaching from Central
      Asia," "teaching perpetuated through an immense space of ages,"
      "constant and unalterable holiness."<br>
      <br>
      Some of the outer teaching is preserved in Aramaic text in the
      Vatican in Rome. Some in Slavic text was found in the possession
      of the Habsburgs in Austria and said to have been brought out of
      Asia in the thirteenth century by Nestorian priests fleeing the
      hordes of Genghis Khan.<br>
      <br>
      Echoes of the teaching exist today in many forms, in certain
      rituals of the Masonic order, in the symbol of the seven-branched
      candlestick, in the greeting "Peace be with you," used from the
      time of Moses, and even in the seven days of the week, which have
      long since lost their original spiritual meaning.<br>
      <br>
      From its antiquity, its persistence through the ages, it is
      evident the teaching could not have been the concept of any
      individual or any people, but is the interpretation, by a
      succession of great Teachers, of the Law of the universe, the
      basic Law, eternal and unchanging as the stars in their courses,
      the same now as two or ten thousand years ago, and as applicable
      today as then.<br>
      <br>
      The teaching explains the Law, shows how man's deviations from it
      are the cause of all his troubles, and gives the method by which
      he can find his way out of his dilemma.<br>

      Be not ungrateful to thy Creator,<br>

      The law is living word of living God<br>

      In the forest creatures and the fishes of the sea;<br>
      But it is found chiefly in thyselves.<br>
      All living things are nearer to God<br>

      The sinews of his thighs are knit together.<br>
      His bones are as tubes of brass,<br>
      His limbs are like bars of iron.<br>

      Who lifteth up his voice in full accord with the Law.<br>
      That place is holy whereon one of the Brothers<br>
      Soweth the most Of corn, of grass, of fruit:<br>
      Where he watereth that ground which is dry,<br>
      Or draineth the too wet soil<br>
      For the earth hath been given unto the keeping<br>
      Of the Children of Light,<br>
      That they treasure and care for it,<br>
      And bring from its depths only that<br>
      Which is for the nourishment of the body.<br>
      Blessed are the Children of Light<br>
      Whose joy is in the work of the Law,<br>
      Who labor in the Garden of the Brotherhood by day,<br>
      And join the Angels of the Heavenly Father by night.<br>
      From their lips is the story told,<br>
      Which doth serve as a teaching for the sons of men:<br>
      It is said that the trees went forth on a time<br>
      To anoint a king over them;<br>
      And they said unto the olive tree,<br>
      "Reign thou over us."<br>
      But the olive tree said unto them,<br>
      "Should I leave my fatness,<br>
      Wherewith by me they honor God and man,<br>
      And go to be promoted over the trees?"<br>
      And the trees said to the fig tree,<br>
      "Come thou, and reign over us.<br>
      But the fig tree said unto them,<br>
      "Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit,<br>
      And go to be promoted over the trees?"<br>
      Then said the trees unto the vine,<br>
      "Come thou, and reign over us.<br>
      And the vine said unto them,<br>
      "Should I leave my wine,<br>
      Which cheereth God and man,<br>
      And go to be promoted over the trees?"<br>
      A man of the Law who fulfills his tasks<br>
      Does not need further blessings.<br>

      I will invoke the Angel of Peace,<br>
      Whose breath is friendly,<br>
      Whose hand is clothed in power.<br>
      In the reign of Peace, there is neither hunger nor thirst,<br>
      Neither cold wind nor hot wind,<br>
      Neither old age nor death.<br>
      In the reign of Peace,<br>
      Both animals and men shall be undying,<br>
      Waters and plants shall be undrying,<br>
      And the food of life shall be never-failing.<br>
      It is said that the mountains<br>
      Shall bring peace to the people,<br>
      And the little hills, righteousness.<br>
      There shall be peace<br>
      As long as the sun and moon endure,<br>
      Throughout all generations.<br>
      Peace shall come down like rain upon mown grass,<br>

      In the reign of Peace shall the Law grow strong,<br>
      And the Children of Light shall have dominion<br>
      From sea to sea, unto the ends of the earth.<br>
      The reign of Peace hath its source<br>
      In the Heavenly Father;<br>

      He maketh the outgoings of morning and evening<br>
      To rejoice in the Light,<br>
      He bringeth to earth the river of the Law,<br>
      To water and enrich it,<br>
      He maketh soft the earth with showers;<br>
      They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness,<br>
      And the little hills rejoice on every sidle.<br>
      The pastures are clothed with flocks;<br>
      The valleys also are covered over with corn;<br>
      They shout for joy, they also sing. O Heavenly Father!<br>
      Bring unto thy earth the reign of Peace!<br>
      Then shall we remember the words of him who taught of old the
      Children of Light:<br>
      I give the peace of thy Earthly Mother<br>
      To thy body,<br>
      And the peace of thy Heavenly Father To thy spirit.<br>
      And let the peace of both<br>
      Reign among the sons of men.<br>
      Come to me all that are weary,<br>
      And that suffer in strife and affliction!<br>
      For my peace will strengthen thee and comfort thee.<br>
      For my peace is exceeding full of joy.<br>
      Wherefore do I always greet thee after this manner:<br>
      Peace be with thee!<br>
      Do thou always, therefore, so greet one another,<br>
      That upon thy body may descend<br>
      The Peace of thy Earthly Mother,<br>
      And upon thy spirit<br>
      The Peace of thy Heavenly Father.<br>
      And then wilt thou find peace also among thyselves,<br>
      For the Kingdom of the Law is within thee.<br>
      And return to thy Brothers<br>
      give thy peace to them also,<br>
      For happy are they that strive for peace,<br>
      For they will find the peace of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      And give to every one thy peace,<br>

      There are strange and wondrous works,<br>

      There are yet hid greater things than these be,<br>
      For we have seen but a few of his works:<br>
      The Heavenly Father hath made all things.<br>
      Ae beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars,<br>
      Give light in the highest places of the Heavenly Sea.<br>
      Sentinels of the most High, they stand in their order,<br>
      And never faint in their watches.<br>
      Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it;<br>
      Very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof<br>
      It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle,<br>
      And the hands of the most High have bended it.<br>
      By his Law he maketh the snow to fall apace,<br>
      And sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.<br>
      Through this the treasures are opened,<br>
      And clouds fly forth as fowls.<br>
      By his great power he maketh the clouds firm,<br>
      And the hailstones are broken small.<br>
      At his sight the mountains are shaken,<br>
      And at his will the south wind bloweth.<br>
      The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble:<br>
      So doth the northerm storm and the whirlwind:<br>
      As birds flying he scattereth the snow,<br>
      And the eye marvelleth<br>
      At the beauty of the whiteness thereof,<br>
      And the heart is astonished at the raining of it.<br>
      So do the heavens declare the glory of God,<br>
      And the firmament showeth his handiwork.<br>
      Who hath made the waters,<br>
      And who maketh the plants?<br>
      Who to the wind hath yoked the storm-clouds,<br>
      The swift and even the fleetest?<br>
      Who, O Heavenly Father,<br>
      Is the creator of the holy Law within our souls?<br>
      Who hath made the light and the darkness?<br>
      Who hath made sleep and the zest of the waking hours?<br>
      Who gave the recurring sun and stars<br>
      Their undeviating way?<br>
      Who established that whereby the moon doth wax<br>
      And whereby she waneth?<br>
      Who, save thee, Heavenly Father,<br>
      Hath done these glorious things!<br>

      In all generations.<br>
      Before the mountains were brought forth,<br>
      Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,<br>
      Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art the Law.<br>
      Thy name is Understanding,<br>
      Thy name is Wisdom,<br>
      Thy name is the Most Beneficent,<br>
      Thy name is the Unconquerable One,<br>
      Thy name is He Who maketh the true account,<br>
      Thy name is the All-seeing One,<br>
      Thy name is the Healing One,<br>
      Thy name is the Creator.<br>
      Thou art the Keeper,<br>
      Thou art the Creator and the Maintainer;<br>
      Thou art the Discerner and the Spirit.<br>
      Thou art the Holy Law.<br>
      These names were pronounced<br>
      Before the Creation of this Heaven,<br>
      Be-fore the making of the waters and of the plants,<br>
      Before the birth of our holy Father Enoch.<br>
      Before the beginning of time,<br>
      The Heavenly Father planted the holy Tree of Life,<br>
      Which standeth forever in the midst of the Eternal Sea<br>
      High in its branches sings a bird,<br>
      And only those who have journeyed there,<br>
      And have heard the mysterious song of the bird,<br>
      Only those shall see the Heavenly Father.<br>
      They shall ask of him his name,<br>
      And he shall answer, I am that I am,<br>
      Being ever the same as the Etemal I am.<br>
      O thou Heavenly Father!<br>
      How excellent is thy name in all the earth!<br>
      Thou hast set thy glory above the heavens.<br>

      The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained,<br>
      What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<br>
      Yet thou hast made a covenant<br>
      With the Children of Light,<br>
      And they walk with thy holy Angels;<br>
      Thou hast crowned them with glory and honor,<br>
      Thou madest them to have dominion<br>
      Over the works of thy hands,<br>
      And gavest unto them<br>
      The task of nourishing and protecting<br>

      Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br>
      If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there;<br>
      If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.<br>
      If I take the wings of the morning,<br>
      And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,<br>
      Even there shall thy hand lead me,<br>
      And thy right hand shall hold me.<br>
      If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me,<br>

      Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee<br>
      But the night shineth as the day:<br>

      So panteth my soul after thee, O God.<br>
      My soul thirsteth for the living Heavenly Father.<br>

      One thing have I desired of the Law,<br>
      That I will seek after:<br>
      That I may dwell in the house of the Law<br>
      All the days of my life,<br>
      To behold the beauty of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      Those who dwell in the secret place of the most High<br>
      Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br>

      And under his wings shall we trust;<br>
      His truth shall be our shield and buckler.<br>
      We shall not be afraid for the terror by night,<br>
      Nor for the arrow that flieth by day,<br>
      Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness,<br>
      Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.<br>

      Neither shall any plague come nigh our dwelling,<br>

      Go towards the high growing Trees,<br>
      And before one of them<br>
      Which is beautiful, high growing and mighty,<br>
      Say thou these words:<br>
      Hail be unto Thee!<br>
      O good living Tree,<br>
      Made by the Creator.<br>
      In the days of old, when the Creation was young,<br>
      The earth was filled with giant trees,<br>
      Whose branches soared above the clouds,<br>
      And in them dwelled our Ancient Fathers,<br>
      They who walked with the Angels,<br>
      And who lived by the Holy Law.<br>
      In the shadow of their branches all men lived in peace,<br>
      And wisdom and knowledge was theirs,<br>
      And the revelation of the Endless Light.<br>
      Through their forests flowed the Eternal River,<br>
      And in the center stood the Tree of Life,<br>
      And it was not hidden from them.<br>
      They ate from the table of the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And slept in the arms of the Heavenly Father,<br>
      And their covenant was for eternity with the Holy Law.<br>
      In that time the trees were the brothers of men,<br>
      And their span on the earth was very long,<br>
      As long as the Eternal River,<br>
      Which-flowed without ceasing<br>
      From the Unknown Spring.<br>
      Now the desert sweeps the earth with burning sand,<br>
      The giant trees are dust and ashes,<br>
      And the wide river is a pool of mud.<br>
      For the sacred covenant with the Creator<br>
      Was broken by the sons of men,<br>
      And they were banished from their home of trees.<br>
      Now the path leading to the Tree of Life<br>
      Is hidden from the eyes of men,<br>
      And sorrow fills the empty sky<br>
      Where once the lofty branches soared.<br>
      Now into the burning desert<br>
      Come the Children of Light,<br>
      To, labor in the Garden of the Brotherhood.<br>
      The seed they plant in the barren soil<br>
      Will become a mighty forest,<br>
      And trees shall multiply<br>
      And spread their wings of green<br>
      Until the whole earth be covered once again.<br>
      The whole earth shall be a garden,<br>
      And the tall trees shall cover the land<br>
      In that day shall sing the Children of Light a new song:<br>
      My brother, Tree!<br>
      Let me not hide myself from thee,<br>
      But let us share the breath of life<br>
      Which our Earthly Mother hath given to us.<br>
      More beautiful than the finest jewel<br>
      Of the rugmaker's art,<br>
      Is the carpet of green leaves under my bare feet;<br>
      More majestic than the silken canopy of the rich merchant,<br>
      Is the tent of branches above my head,<br>
      Through which the bright stars give light.<br>
      The wind among the leaves of the cypress<br>
      Maketh a sound like unto a chorus of angels.<br>
      Through the rugged oak and royal cedar<br>
      The Earthly Mother hath sent a message of Eternal Life<br>
      To the Heavenly Father.<br>
      My prayer goeth forth unto the tall trees:<br>
      And their branches reaching skyward<br>
      Shall carry my voice to the Heavenly Father.<br>
      For each child thou shalt plant a tree,<br>
      That the womb of thy Earthly Mother<br>
      Shall bring forth life,<br>
      As the womb of woman doth bring forth life.<br>
      He who doth destroy a tree<br>
      Hath cut off his own limbs.<br>
      Thus shall sing the Children of Light,<br>
      When the earth again shall be a garden:<br>
      Holy Tree, divine gift of the Law!<br>
      Thy majesty reunites all those<br>
      Who have strayed from their true home,<br>
      Which is the Garden of the Brotherhood.<br>
      All men will become brothers once again<br>
      Under thy spreading branches.<br>
      As the Heavenly Father hath loved all his children,<br>
      So shall we love and care for the trees<br>
      That grow in our land,<br>
      So shall we keep and protect them,<br>
      That they may grow tall and strong,<br>
      And fill the earth again with their beauty.<br>
      For the trees are our brothers,<br>

      Hail to our holy Father Enoch!<br>
      Hail to the whole of Holy Creation that was, that is, or ever
      shall be!<br>
      We sacrifice unto the bright and glorious stars,<br>
      We sacrifice unto the sovereign sky,<br>
      We sacrifice unto boundless time,<br>
      We sacrifice unto the good Law<br>
      Of the worshipers of the Creator,<br>
      Of the Children of Light<br>
      Who labor in the Garden of the Brotherhood;<br>
      We sacrifice unto the way of the Holy Law.<br>
      We sacrifice unto all the Holy Angels<br>
      Of the world unseen;<br>
      We sacrifice unto all the Holy Angels Of the material world.<br>

      We give thanks unto the God of the Angels,<br>
      We give thanks unto the Lord of Light,<br>
      For his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
      To him who alone doeth great wonders,<br>
      To him that by wisdom made the heavens,<br>
      To him that stretched out the earth above the waters,<br>
      To him that made great lights in the heavens,<br>
      To him that made the sun to rule by day,<br>
      And the moon and stars to rule by night,<br>
      Give unending praise and thanksgiving,<br>
      For his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
      And we do worship the ancient and holy religion,<br>
      Which was instituted at the Creation,<br>
      Which was on the earth in the time of the Great Trees;<br>
      The holy religion of the Creator,<br>
      The resplendent and the glorious,<br>
      Revealed unto our Father Enoch.<br>
      We do worship the Creator,<br>
      And the Fire of Life<br>
      And the good Waters which are Holy,<br>
      And the resplendent Sun and the Moon,<br>
      And the lustrous, glorious Stars;<br>
      And most of all we do worship the Holy Law,<br>
      Which the Creator, our Heavenly Father,<br>
      Hath given to us.<br>
      It is the Law which maketh holy our dwelling place,<br>
      Which is the wide green earth.<br>
      Praise ye the Law!<br>
      The Law healeth the broken in heart,<br>
      And bindeth up their wounds.<br>
      Great is the Law, and of great power;<br>
      The understanding of the Law is infinite.<br>
      The Law lifteth up the meek,<br>
      And casteth the wicked down to the ground.<br>
      Sing unto the Law with thanksgiving,<br>
      Sing praise upon the harp unto the Law,<br>
      Which covereth the heaven with clouds,<br>
      Which prepareth rain for the earth,<br>
      Which maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.<br>
      We praise aloud the well-thought Thought,<br>
      The Word well-spoken,<br>
      And the Deed well-done.<br>
      We will come to thee, O ye bountiful immortals!<br>
      We will come to thee, extolling and invoking thee,<br>
      Angels of the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother!<br>
      We do worship the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Order,<br>
      The Creator of all good creatures of the earth.<br>
      And we do worship the utterances of our Father Enoch,<br>
      And his ancient, pure religion,<br>
      His faith and his lore, older than the beginning of time.<br>
      We will sing unto the Law as long as we live,<br>
      We will sing praise unto our Heavenly Father<br>
      While we have our being,<br>
      While the Garden of the Brotherhood doth endure.<br>
      Our Communions with the Angels shall be sweet;<br>
      We will be glad in the Law.<br>
      Bless thou the Law, O my soul.<br>
      Praise ye the Holy Law.<br>
      The Children of Light love the Law,<br>
      Because the Law heareth our voices<br>
      And our supplications.<br>
      An all-hearing ear hath the Law inclined unto us,<br>
      Therefore will we call upon the Law as long as we live.<br>
      The Law hath delivered our souls from death,<br>
      Our eyes from tears, and our feet from falling.<br>
      We will walk before the Law in the land of the living:<br>
      In the paths of the Infinite<br>
      Garden of the Brotherhood.<br>
      The days of the sons of men are as grass;<br>
      As flowers of the field, so they flourish.<br>
      For the wind passeth over them, and they are gone:<br>
      But the mercy of the Law is from everlasting<br>
      To everlasting upon them that follow it.<br>
      Bless the Heavenly Father, all ye his Angels;<br>
      Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.<br>
      Bless the Lord, all his works,<br>
      In all places of his dominion:<br>
      Bless the Lord, O my soul.<br>
      O Heavenly Father, thou art very great!<br>
      Thou art clothed with honor and majesty.<br>
      Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment,<br>
      Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain,<br>
      Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters,<br>
      Who maketh the clouds his chariot,<br>
      Who walketh upon the wings of the wind,<br>
      Who maketh his Angels spirits,<br>
      His Children of Light a flaming fire<br>
      To kindle the Truth in the hearts of the sons of men,<br>
      Who laid the foundations of the earth.<br>
      Bless the Heavenly Father, O my soul!<br>

      Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.<br>
      Lord, hear my voice!<br>
      Hear my prayer, O Lord,<br>
      And let my cry come unto thee.<br>
      Hide not thy face from me<br>
      In the day when I am in trouble;<br>
      Incline thine ear unto me;<br>
      In the day when I call answer me speedily.<br>
      For my days are consumed like smoke,<br>
      And my bones are burned as a hearth.<br>
      My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;<br>
      So that I forget to eat my bread.<br>
      By reason of the voice of my groaning<br>
      My bones cleave to my skin.<br>
      I am like a pelican of the wilderness;<br>
      I am like an owl of the desert.<br>
      I watch, and am as a sparrow,<br>
      Alone upon the house top.<br>
      My days are like a shadow that declineth;<br>
      And I am withered like grass.<br>
      O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:<br>
      The heavens are the work of thy hands.<br>
      They shall perish, but thou shalt endure.<br>
      The first step taken<br>
      By the soul of the wicked man,<br>
      Laid him in the evil thought hell.<br>
      The second step take<br>
      By the soul of the wicked man,<br>
      Laid him in the evil word hell.<br>
      The third step taken<br>
      By the soul of the wicked man,<br>
      Laid him in the evil deed hell.<br>
      The fourth step taken<br>
      By the soul of the wicked man,<br>
      Laid him in endless darkness.<br>
      I know that thou canst do all things,<br>
      And that no purpose of thine-can be restrained.<br>
      Now mine eye seeth thee,<br>
      Wherefore I abhor myself,<br>
      And repent in dust and ashes.<br>
      For the wicked sons of men<br>
      Have sinned against themselves,<br>
      And their hell of evil thoughts, evil words and evil deeds<br>
      Is a hell of their own making.<br>
      But my anguish and my bitter tears<br>
      Are for our ancient fathers,<br>
      Who sinned against the Creator,<br>
      And were banished<br>
      From the Holy Kingdom of the Great Trees.<br>
      Wherefore I weep, and hide my face in sorrow,<br>
      For the beauty of the Lost Garden,<br>
      And the vanished sweetness of the song of the Bird,<br>
      Who sang in the branches of the Tree of Life.<br>
      Have mercy upon me, O God,<br>
      And cleanse me from my sin.<br>
      The joy of our hearts is ceased,<br>
      Our dance is turned into mourning.<br>
      The crown is fallen from our head:<br>
      Woe unto us, that we have sinned!<br>
      For this our heart is faint,<br>
      For these things our eyes are dim.<br>
      Thou, O Heavenly Father, remainest forever,<br>
      Thy throne from generation to generation.<br>
      Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,<br>
      And forsake us so long time?<br>
      Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,<br>
      Renew our days as of old.<br>
      Where there is no righteousness or compassion,<br>
      There wild beasts of the desert shall lie;<br>
      And their houses shall be full of doleful creatures.<br>
      And owls shall dwell there,<br>
      And satyrs shall dance there.<br>
      And the wild beasts shall cry in their desolate houses.<br>
      Wash me, O Lord, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
      Make me to hear joy and gladness;<br>
      Hide thy face from my sins,<br>
      And blot out all mine iniquities.<br>
      Create in me a clean heart, O God,'<br>
      And renew a right spirit within me.<br>
      Cast me not away from thy presence;<br>
      And take not thy holy spirit from me.<br>
      Restore unto me the joy of thy Infinite Garden,<br>
      And uphold me with thy Holy Angels.<br>
      Let me drive away all evil things<br>
      And all uncleanness,<br>
      From the fire, the water,<br>
      The earth, the trees,<br>
      From the faithful man and the faithful woman,<br>
      From the stars, the moon, the sun,<br>
      From the boundless Light,<br>
      And from all good things,<br>
      Made by thee, O Heavenly Father,<br>
      Whose offspring is the Holy Law.<br>
      By the rivers of Babylon,<br>
      Where we sat down, yea, we wept,<br>
      When we remembered Zion.<br>
      We hanged our harps upon the willows.<br>
      How shall we sing the Lord's song in a wicked land?<br>
      If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,<br>
      Let my right hand forget her cunning.<br>
      If I do not remember thee,<br>
      Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth;<br>
      For Babylon is the slavery in the world,<br>
      And Zion is the freedom in the Brotherhood.<br>
      O Lord, to thee will I cry!<br>
      For the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness,<br>
      And the flame hath burned All the trees of the field.<br>
      The beasts of the field cry also unto thee:<br>
      For the rivers Of waters are dried up,<br>
      And the fire hath devoured<br>
      The pastures of the wilderness.<br>
      Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble:<br>
      For the d'ay of the Lord cometh,<br>
      For it is nigh at hand;<br>
      A day of darkness and gloominess,<br>
      A day of clouds and of thick darkness,<br>
      A day when the earth shall quake,<br>
      And the heavens shall tremble.<br>
      The sun and the moon shall be dark,<br>
      And the stars shall withdraw their shining.<br>
      Out of the depths will we cry unto thee, O Lord!<br>
      Lord, hear thou our voices!<br>

      And look upon the earth beneath:<br>
      For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,<br>
      And the earth shall wax old like a garment,<br>
      And they that dwell therein<br>
      Shall die in like manner:<br>
      But my Kingdom shall be for ever,<br>
      And my Law shall not be abolished.<br>
      And in that day hell shall enlarge herself,<br>
      And open her mouth without measure:<br>
      And the glory, the pride and the pomp of the wicked<br>
      Shall descend into it.<br>
      And the mean man shall be brought down,<br>
      And the mighty man shall be humbled<br>
      As the fire devoureth the stubble,<br>
      And the flame consumeth the chaff;<br>
      So their root shall be as rottenness,<br>
      And their blossom shall go up as dust.<br>
      Because they have cast away<br>
      The Holy Law of the Heavenly Order,<br>
      And despised the word of the Children of Light.<br>
      And in that day, one will look unto the land<br>

      And the light in the heavens shall be darkened.<br>
      The leaders of the people shall cause them to err,<br>
      And they that are led of them shall be destroyed.<br>

      Woe unto those who lust after the things of the world,<br>
      And corrupt themselves with wrongdoing,<br>
      Who err in vision, and stumble in judgment:<br>
      For they are a rebellious people, a lying people,<br>
      People who will not hear the Law of the Lord:<br>
      Which say to the seers, see not,<br>
      And to the Prophets, prophesy not unto us right things,<br>

      that lay field to field,<br>
      Till there be no place that a man may be alone<br>
      In the midst of the earth!<br>
      Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning,<br>

      With scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.<br>

      The city of confusion is broken down:<br>
      Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.<br>
      There is a crying and wailing in the streets:<br>
      All joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.<br>

      That he who fleeth from the noise of the fear<br>

      The ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly,<br>
      And the highways shall lie waste.<br>

      That the mountains might flow down at thy presence<br>
      When thy hand showed forth the power of thy Law<br>

      We are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,<br>
      Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<br>
      We trust in vanity, and speak lies;<br>
      Our feet run to evil,<br>
      Wasting and destruction are in our paths.<br>
      We grope for the wall like the blind,<br>
      We stumble at noon day as in the night,<br>
      We are in desolate places as dead men.<br>
      But now, O Heavenly Father, thou art our father:<br>
      We are the clay, and thou our potter,<br>
      And we are all thy people.<br>
      Thy holy cities are a wilderness,<br>
      Thy forests are consumed,<br>
      All thy earth is a desolation.<br>
      Our holy and beautiful house<br>
      Where our fathers praised thee,<br>
      Is burned up with fire.<br>
      Even the ancient lore of our Father Enoch<br>
      Is trampled in the dust and ashes.<br>

      It was without form, and void;<br>
      And the heavens, and they had no light.<br>
      I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled,<br>
      And all the hills moved lightly.<br>
      I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,<br>
      And all the birds of the heavens<br>
      I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,<br>
      And all the cities thereof were broken down<br>
      At the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger.<br>
      For thus hath the Lord said,<br>
      The whole land shall be desolate;<br>
      Yet will I not make a full end.<br>
      Behold, the hand of the Law is not shortened,<br>
      That it cannot save;<br>
      Neither is the ear of the Law heavy,<br>
      That it cannot hear:<br>
      From out of the desert shall I bring forth a seed,<br>
      And the seed shall be planted<br>
      In the Garden of the Brotherhood,<br>
      And it shall flourish,<br>
      And the Children of Light shall cover the barren land<br>
      With tall grass and trees bearing fruit.<br>
      And they shall build the old waste places:<br>
      They shall repair the waste cities<br>
      The desolations of many generations.<br>
      They shall be called the repairers of the breach,<br>
      And the restorers of paths to dwell in.<br>
      They shall be a crown of glory on the head of the Lord<br>
      And a royal diadem in the hand of the Law.<br>
      The wilderness and the solitary place<br>
      Shall be glad for them,<br>
      And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.<br>
      It shall blossom abundantly,<br>
      And rejoice even with joy and singing.<br>
      The eyes of the blind shall be opened,<br>
      And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped<br>
      Then shall the lame man leap as an hart<br>
      And the tongue of the dumb shall sing<br>
      For in the wilderness shall waters break out,<br>
      And flowing streams in the desert.<br>
      And the parched ground shall become a pool,<br>
      And the thirsty land springs of water.<br>
      And an highway shall be there, and a way,<br>
      And it shall be called the Way of the Law:<br>
      The unclean shall not pass over it,<br>
      But it shall be for the Children of Light<br>
      To cross over the Eternal River unto the hidden place<br>
      Where standeth the Tree of Life.<br>
      And the children of men shall return to the earth,<br>
      And come unto the Infinite Garden<br>
      With songs and everlasting joy upon their heads:<br>
      They shall obtain joy and gladness,<br>
      And sorrow and sighing shall flee away,<br>
      And it shall come to pass in the last days,<br>
      That the mountain of the Lord's house<br>
      Shall be established in the top of the mountains,<br>
      And shall be exalted above the hills;<br>
      And all the sons of men of the earth shall flow unto it.<br>
      And many people shall go and say,<br>
      'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,<br>
      To the tabernacle of the Holy Law,<br>
      And the Holy Angels will teach us<br>
      of the ways of the Heavenly Father<br>
      And the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And we will walk in the paths of the righteous:<br>
      For out of the Garden of the Brotherhood<br>
      Shall go forth the Law,<br>
      And the word of the Lord from the Children of Light.<br>
      And the Lord shall judge among the nations,<br>
      And shall rebuke many people:<br>
      And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,<br>
      And their spears into pruning hooks:<br>
      Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br>
      Neither shall they learn war any more.<br>
      Hear the voices of the Brothers,<br>
      Which cry aloud in the wilderness:<br>
      Prepare ye the way of the Law!<br>
      Make straight in the desert a highway for our God!<br>
      Every valley shall be exalted,<br>
      And every mountain and hill shall be made low:<br>
      And the crooked shall be made straight,<br>
      And the rough places plain:<br>
      And the voice of the Heavenly Father shall be heard:<br>
      1, even I, am the Law; and beside me there is no other.<br>
      Yea, before the day was I am he:<br>
      And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.<br>
      Hearken unto me, O Children of Light!<br>
      I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br>
      Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth,<br>
      And my right hand hath spanned the heavens.<br>
      Hearken unto me, O Children of Light!<br>
      Ye that know righteousness,<br>
      My children in whose hearts is my Law:<br>
      Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:<br>
      The mountains and the hills<br>
      Shall break forth before you into singing,<br>
      And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br>
      Arise, shine, O Children of Light!<br>
      For my Light is come upon thee,<br>
      And thou shalt make the Glory of the Law<br>
      To rise upon the new earth!<br>

      <br>
      It was in 1928 that Edmond Bordeaux Szekely first published his
      translation of Book One of The Essene Gospel of Peace, an ancient
      manuscript he had found in the Secret Archives of the Vatican as
      the result of limitless patience, faultless scholarship, and
      unerring intuition, a story told in his book, The Discovery of the
      Essene Gospel of Peace. The English version of this ancient
      manuscript appeared in 1937, and ever since, the little volume has
      traveled all over the world, appearing in different languages, and
      gaining every year more and more readers, until now, still with no
      commercial advertisement, over a million copies have been sold in
      the United States alone. It was not until almost fifty years after
      the first French translation that Book Two and Book Three
      appeared, and these also have now become classics of the Essene
      literature.<br>
      <br>
      Book Four, The Teachings of the Elect, will come as a surprise to
      those readers who are aware of Dr. Szekely's death in 1979. if I
      were also a philologist, or scholar, or archeologist, I might be
      able to provide some explanation. But I am only his faithful
      famulus amanuensis, and the instructions he left me were clear and
      explicit: "Two years after my death, you shall publish Book Four
      of The Essene Gospel of Peace. " That was all, and I am now
      carrying out his wish.<br>
      <br>
      This Book Four, The Teachings of the Elect, represents yet another
      fragment of the complete manuscript which exists in Aramaic in the
      Secret Archives of the Vatican and in old Slavonic in the Royal
      Library of the Habsburgs (now the property of the Austrian
      government). As to the reason for the delay in its publication, I
      can only surmise that Dr. Szekely wanted the vivid reality of
      these ageless truths to stand alone, unobscured even by the
      presence of the translator. He did say in his Preface to the first
      London edition of Book One in 1937 that "we have issued this part
      before the rest, because it is the part of which suffering
      humanity has most need today." Perhaps, in the same way, the
      troubled world of forty-four years later needs this fourth volume
      of The Essene Gospel of Peace.<br>
      <br>
      Again the words of Dr. Szekely: "We have nothing to add to this
      text. It speaks for itself. The reader who studies the pages that
      follow with concentration, will feel the eternal vitality and
      powerful evidence of these profound truths which mankind needs
      today more urgently than ever before."<br>
      <br>
      "And the truth shall bear witness of itself."<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>THE ESSENE COMMUNIONS</b><br>

      <br>
      And it came to pass that Jesus gathered the Sons of Light by the
      shore of the river, to reveal to them that which had been hidden;
      for the space of seven years had passed, and each one was ripe for
      truth, as the flower opens from the bud when the angels of sun and
      water bring it to its time of blossoming.<br>
      <br>
      And all of them were unlike one to the other, for some were of
      age, and some had still the dew of youth on their cheeks, and some
      had been raised according to the traditions of their fathers, and
      others knew not who their father and mother had been. But all
      shared in a clearness of eye and a suppleness of body, for these
      were signs that for seven years they had walked with the angels of
      the Earthly Mother and obeyed her laws. And for seven years the
      unknown angels of the Heavenly Father had taught them through
      their sleeping hours. And now was the day come when they would
      enter the Brotherhood of the Elect and learn the hidden teachings
      of the Elders, even those of Enoch and before.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus led the Sons of Light to an ancient tree by the side of
      the river, and there he knelt at the place where the roots,
      gnarled and hoary with age, spread over the river edge. And the
      Sons of Light knelt also, and they did touch with reverence the
      trunk of the ancient tree, for it was taught to them that the
      trees are the Brothers of the Sons of Men. For their mother is the
      same, the Earthly Mother, whose blood runs in the sap of the tree
      and in the body of the Son of Man. And their father is the same,
      the Heavenly Father, whose laws are written in the branches of the
      tree, and whose laws are engraved in the forehead of the Son of
      Man.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus reached out his hands to the tree, and said: "Behold,
      the Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the Eternal Sea.
      Look not only with the eyes of the body, but see with the eyes of
      the spirit the Tree of Life at a source of running streams; at a
      living spring in a land of drought. See the eternal garden of
      wonders, and at its center the Tree of Life, mystery of mysteries,
      growing everlasting branches for eternal planting, to sink their
      roots into the stream of life from an eternal source. See with the
      eyes of the spirit the angels of day and the angels of night which
      protect the fruits with flames of Eternal Light burning every way.<br>
      <br>
      "See, oh Sons of Light, the branches of the Tree of Life reaching
      toward the kingdom of the Heavenly Father. And see the roots of
      the Tree of Life descending into the bosom of the Earthly Mother.
      And the Son of Man is raised to an eternal height and walks in the
      wonders of the plain; for only the Son of Man carries in his body
      the roots of the Tree of Life; the same roots that suckle from the
      bosom of the Earthly Mother; and only the Son of Man carries in
      his spirit the branches of the Tree of Life; the same branches
      that reach to the sky, even so to the kingdom of the Heavenly
      Father.<br>
      <br>
      "And for seven years have you labored throughout the day with the
      angels of the Earthly Mother; and for seven years you have slept
      in the arms of the Heavenly Father. And now your reward shall be
      great, for it shall be given unto you the gift of tongues, that
      you may draw to you the full power of your Earthly Mother, and
      have command over her angels and dominion over all her kingdom;
      and that you may draw to you the blinding glory of your Heavenly
      Father, that you may command his angels and enter into life
      everlasting in the heavenly kingdoms.<br>
      <br>
      "And for seven years these words were not given unto you, for he
      who uses the gift of tongues to seek after riches, or to hold sway
      over his enemies, he shall no longer be a Son of Light, but a
      whelp of the devil and a creature of darkness.<br>
      <br>
      For only the pure water can mirror forth the light of the sun; and
      that water which has become dank with filth and murk can reflect
      nothing. And when the body and the spirit of the Son of Man have
      walked with the angels of the Earthly Mother and the Heavenly
      Father for seven years, then is he like the running river under
      the noonday sun, mirroring forth dazzling lights of brilliant
      jewels.<br>
      <br>
      " Hear me, Sons of Light, for I will impart to you the gift of
      tongues, that by speaking to your Earthly Mother in the morning,
      and to your Heavenly Father in the evening, you may go closer and
      closer to oneness with the kingdoms of earth and heaven, that
      oneness for which the Son of Man is destined from the beginning of
      the times.<br>
      <br>
      "I will make known unto you deep and mysterious things. For I tell
      you truly, all things exist by God and there is none beside him.
      Direct your hearts, therefore, that you may walk on the right
      paths, where his presence is.<br>
      <br>
      "When you open your eyes in the morning, even then before your
      body has been called by the Angel of Sun, say to yourselves these
      words, letting them echo in your spirit; for words are like dead
      leaves when there is no life in them of the spirit. Say, then,
      these words: 'I enter the eternal and infinite garden of mystery,
      my spirit in oneness with the Heavenly Father, my body in oneness
      with the Earthly Mother, my heart in harmony with my Brothers, the
      Sons of Men, dedicating my spirit, my body, and my heart to the
      holy, pure and saving Teaching, even that Teaching which of old
      was known to Enoch.'<br>
      <br>
      "And after these words have entered into your spirit, on the first
      morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'The Earthly Mother and I
      are one. Her breath is my breath; her blood is my blood; her bone,
      her flesh, her bowels, her eyes and ears, are my bone, my flesh,
      my bowels, my eyes and ears. Never will I desert her, and always
      will she nourish and sustain my body.' And you will feel the power
      of the Earthly Mother flowing through your body like the river
      when it is swollen with rains and courses mightily with a great
      noise.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the second morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Earth, make fruitful my seed, and with your power give life to
      my body.' Even as your seed creates new life, so courses through
      the earth the seed of the angel of Earth: in the grass, in the
      soil, in all living things that grow from the soil. Know, oh Sons
      of Light, that the same angel of Earth that makes your seed into
      sons also makes the tiny acorn into this mighty oak, and makes the
      seed-bearing wheat to grow for bread for the Son of Man. And the
      seed of your body need not enter the body of woman to create life;
      for the power of the angel of Earth can create the life of the
      spirit within, as well as the life of the body without.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the third morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Life, enter with strength the limbs of my body.' And with these
      words embrace the Tree of Life, even as I embrace this brother
      oak, and you will feel the power of the angel of Life flow to your
      arms, and to your legs, and to all the parts of your body, as the
      sap flows in the tree in the spring, even as it runs out of the
      trunk, so will the angel of Life flood your body with the power of
      the Earthly Mother.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the fourth morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of joy, descend upon earth, pouring forth beauty and delight to
      all the children of the Earthly Mother and the, Heavenly Father.'
      And you will go forth into the fields of flowers after rain and
      give thanks to your Earthly Mother for the sweet odor of blossoms;
      for I tell you truly, a flower has no other purpose than to bring
      joy to the heart of the Son of Man. And you will listen with new
      ears to the song of the birds, and see with new eyes the colors of
      the sun in its rising and its setting; and all these gifts of the
      Earthly Mother will cause joy to well forth within you, as a
      spring wells forth of a sudden in a barren place. And you shall
      know that no one comes before the Heavenly Father that the angel
      of joy lets not pass; for in joy was the earth created, and in joy
      did the Earthly Mother and the Heavenly Father give birth to the
      Son of Man.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the fifth morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Sun, enter my body and let me bathe in the fire of life.' And
      you will feel the rays of the rising sun enter into the center
      point of your body, there in the center where the angels of day
      and of night mingle, and the power of the sun shall be yours to
      direct to any part of your body, for the angels dwell therein.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the sixth morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Water, enter my blood and give the Water of Life to my body.'
      And you will feel, like the rushing current of the river, the
      power of the angel of Water enter your blood, and like the
      rivulets of a stream, send the power of the Earthly Mother through
      your blood to all the parts of your body. And it shall be for
      healing, for the power of the angel of Water is very great, and
      when you speak to her, she will send her power wherever you
      command, for when the angels of God dwell within the Son of Man,
      are all things possible.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the seventh morning after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Air, enter with my breath and give the Air of Life to my body.'
      Know, oh Sons of Light, that the Angel of Air is the messenger of
      the Heavenly Father, and no one comes before the face of God that
      the angel of Air lets not pass. For we do not think of the angel
      of Air when we breathe, for we breathe without thought, as the
      sons of darkness live their lives without thought. But when the
      power of life enters into your words and into your breathing, then
      for every time you invoke the Angel of Air, so do you also invoke
      the unknown angels of the Heavenly Father; and you will go closer
      and closer to the heavenly kingdoms.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the Sabbath evening, say these words: 'The Heavenly Father
      and I are One.' And close your eyes, Sons of Light, and in sleep
      enter into the unknown realms of the Heavenly Father. And you will
      bathe in the light of the stars, and the Heavenly Father will hold
      you in his hand and cause a spring of knowledge to well up within
      you; a fountain of power, pouring forth living waters, a flood of
      love and of all-embracing wisdom, like the splendor of Eternal
      Light. And one day the eyes of your spirit shall open, and you
      shall know all things.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the first evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Eternal Life, descend upon me and give eternal life to my
      spirit.' And close your eyes, Sons of Light, and in sleep
      contemplate the oneness of all life everywhere. For I tell you
      truly, in the daylight hours are our feet on the ground and we
      have no wings with which to fly. But our spirits are not tied to
      the earth., and with the coming of night we overcome our
      attachment to the earth and join with that which is eternal. For
      the Son of Man is not all that he seems, and only with the eyes of
      the spirit can we see those golden threads which link us with all
      life everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the second evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Creative Work, descend upon earth and give abundance to all the
      Sons of Men.' For this most powerful of the angels of the Heavenly
      Father is the cause of movement, and only in movement is life.
      Work, Sons of Light, in the garden of the Brotherhood to create
      the kingdom of the heavens upon earth. And as you work, so will
      the angel of Creative Work nurture and ripen the seed of your
      spirit, that you may see God.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the third evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Peace,
      peace, peace, Angel of Peace, be always everywhere.' Seek the
      angel of Peace in all that lives, in all you do, in every word you
      speak. For peace is the key to all knowledge, to all mystery, to
      all life. Where there is no peace, there does Satan reign. And the
      sons of darkness covet most of all to steal from the Sons of Light
      their peace. Go, therefore, on this night to the golden stream of
      light that is the garment of the angel of Peace. And bring back to
      the morning the peace of God that surpasses understanding, that
      with this perfect peace you may comfort the hearts of the Sons of
      Men.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the fourth evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Power, descend on me and fill with power all my deeds.' I tell
      you truly, just as there is no life on earth without the sun, so
      there is no life of the spirit without the Angel of Power. What
      you think and what you feel, these are like the dead scriptures,
      which are only words on a page, or the dead speech of dead men.
      But the Sons of Light will not only think, will not only feel, but
      will also do, and their acts will fulfill their thoughts and
      feelings, as the golden fruit of summer gives meaning to the green
      leaves of spring.<br>
      <br>
      'And on the fifth evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Love, descend on me and fill with love all my feelings.' For it
      is by love that the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother and the
      Son of Man become one. Love is eternal. Love is stronger than
      death. And every night should the Sons of Light bathe in the holy
      water of the angel of Love, that with the morning he may baptize
      the Sons of Men with kind deeds and gentle words. For when the
      heart of the Son of Light is bathed in love, only kind and gentle
      words speak forth.<br>
      <br>
      "And on the sixth evening after Sabbath, say these words: 'Angel
      of Wisdom, descend on me and fill with wisdom all my thoughts.'
      Know, Sons of Light, that your thoughts are as powerful as the
      bolt of lightning that stabs through th6 storm and splits asunder
      the mighty tree. It was for this that you have waited seven years
      to learn how to speak with the angels, for you know not the power
      of your thoughts. Use, then, wisdom in all you think and say and
      do. For I tell you truly, that which is done without wisdom is as
      a rider less horse, mouth foaming and eyes wild, running crazed
      into a yawning chasm. But when the angel of Wisdom governs your
      deeds, then is the path to the unknown realms established, and
      order and harmony govern your lives.<br>
      <br>
      "And these are the communions with the angels which are given to
      the Sons of Light, that with bodies purified by the Earthly Mother
      and spirits purified by the Heavenly Father, they may command and
      serve the angels, continually, from period to period, in the
      circuits of the day, and in its fixed order; with the coming of
      light from its source and at the turn of evening and the outgoing
      of light, at the outgoing of darkness and the coming in of day,
      continually, in all the generations of time.<br>
      <br>
      "The truth is born out of the spring of Light, falsehood from the
      well of darkness. The dominion of all the children of truth is in
      the hands of the Angels of Light so that they may walk in the ways
      of Light.<br>
      <br>
      "Blessings on all the Sons of Light who have cast their lot with
      the Law, that walk truthfully in all their ways. May the Law bless
      you with all good and keep you from all evil, and illumine your
      hearts with insight into the things of life and grace you with
      knowledge of things Eternal."<br>
      <br>
      And the crescent moon of peace rose over the mountain and slivers
      of light shone in the waters of the river. And the Sons of Light
      as one man knelt in reverence and thanksgiving for the words of
      Jesus, as he taught them in the ancient ways of their fathers,
      even as Enoch was taught of old.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus said: "The Law was planted to reward the Children of
      Light with healing and abundant peace, with long life, with
      fruitful seed of everlasting blessings, with eternal joy in
      immortality of Eternal Light.<br>
      <br>
      "With the coming of day I embrace my Mother, with the coming of
      night I join my Father, and with the outgoing of evening and
      morning I will breathe their Law, and I will not interrupt these
      Communions until the end of time." <br>

      <div align="center"><b>THE GIFT OF LIFE IN THE HUMBLE GRASS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      It was in the month of Thebt, when the earth was covered with
      shoots of young grass after the rains, and the covering of emerald
      green was tender as the fine down of a baby chick. And it was on a
      bright sun-filled morning that Jesus gathered the new Brothers of
      the Elect round about him, that they might hear with their ears
      and understand with their hearts the teachings of their fathers,
      even as it was taught to Enoch of old.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus sat beneath a gnarled and ancient tree, holding in his
      hands a small earthen pot; and in the pot was growing tender grass
      of wheat, the most perfect among all seed bearing herbs. And the
      tender grass within the pot was radiant with life, even as the
      grass and plants which covered the hills far into the distant
      fields and beyond. And Jesus stroked the grass in the pot with the
      hands, even as gently as he would touch the head of a little
      child.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus said: "Happy are you, Sons of Light, for you have
      entered into the deathless way and you walk in the path of truth,
      even as did your fathers of old, who were taught by the Great
      Ones. With the eyes and ears of the spirit do you see and hear the
      sights and sounds of the kingdom of the Earthly Mother: the blue
      sky where dwells the angel of Air, the foaming river where flows
      the angel of Water, the golden light which streams from the angel
      of Sun. And I tell you truly, all these are within you as well as
      without; for your breath, your blood, the fire of life within you,
      all are one with the Earthly Mother.<br>
      <br>
      But of all these, and more, that most precious gift of your
      Earthly Mother is the grass beneath your feet, even that grass
      which you tread upon without thought. Humble and meek is the angel
      of Earth, for she has no wings to fly, nor golden rays of light to
      pierce the mist. But great is her strength and vast is her domain,
      for she covers the earth with her power, and without her the Sons
      of Men would be no more, for no man can live without the grass,
      the trees and the plants of the Earthly Mother. And these are the
      gifts of the angel of Earth to the Sons of Men.<br>
      <br>
      "But now I will speak to you of mysterious things, for I tell you
      truly, the humble grass is more than food for man and beast. it
      hides its glory beneath a lowly aspect, as it was told of a ruler
      of old that he visited the villages of his subjects disguised as a
      beggar, knowing they would tell many things to such a one, but
      would fall down in fear before their King. So does the humble
      grass hide its glory under its coat of humble green, and the Sons
      of Men walk on it, plough it, feed it to their beasts, but know
      not what secrets are hidden within it, even those secrets of
      everlasting life in the heavenly kingdoms.<br>
      <br>
      "But the Sons of Light will know what lies hidden in the grass,
      for it is given to them to bring comfort to the Sons of Men. Even
      so are we taught by the Earthly Mother with this -little handful
      of wheat in a simple pot, even the same earthen pot you use to
      drink milk and gather the honey of bees. Now the pot is filled
      with black soil rich with old leaves and moist with the dew of
      morning, even that most precious gift of the angel of Earth.<br>
      <br>
      "And I did moisten a handful of wheat, that the angel of Water
      entered into it. The angel of Air did also embrace it, and the
      angel of Sun, and the power of the three angels awakened also the
      angel of Life within the wheat, and sprout and root were born in
      each grain.<br>
      <br>
      "Then I put the awakened wheat into the soil of the angel of
      Earth, and the power of the Earthly Mother and all her angels
      entered into the wheat, and when the sun had risen four times the
      grains had become grass. I tell you truly, there is no greater
      miracle than this."<br>
      <br>
      And the Brothers looked with reverence at the tender blades of
      grass in the hands of Jesus, and one asked him: "Master, what is
      the secret of the grass you hold in your hands? Why is it
      different from that grass that covers the hills and the
      mountains?" <br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered "It is not different, Son of Light. All grass,
      all trees, all plants, in every part of the world, all are part of
      the kingdom of the Earthly Mother. But I have separated in this
      pot a small portion of your Mother's kingdom, that you may touch
      her with the hands of the spirit, and that her power may enter
      into your body.<br>
      <br>
      "For I tell you truly, there is a Holy Stream of Life which gave
      birth to the Earthly Mother and all her angels. Invisible is this
      Stream of Life to the eyes of the Sons of Men, for they walk in
      darkness and see not the angels of the day and of the night that
      surround them and hover over them. But the Sons of Light have
      walked for seven years with the angels of the day and of the
      night, and now they are given the secrets of communion with the
      angels. And the eyes of your spirit shall be opened, and you will
      see and hear and touch the Stream of Life that gave birth to the
      Earthly Mother. And you will enter the Holy Stream of Life, and it
      will carry you with infinite tenderness to everlasting life in the
      kingdom of your Heavenly Father."<br>
      <br>
      "How shall we do this, Master?" some asked in amazement. "What
      secrets must we know to see and hear and touch this Holy Stream of
      Life?".<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus did not answer. But he placed his two hands around the
      growing blades of grass in the pot, gently, as if it were the
      forehead of a little child. And he closed his eyes, and around him
      were waves of light, shimmering in the sun, as the summer heat
      makes the light to tremble under a cloudless sky. And the Brothers
      knelt and bowed their heads in reverence before the power of the
      angels which poured forth from the sitting figure of Jesus; and
      still he sat in silence, with his hands closed as if in prayer
      around the blades of grass.<br>
      <br>
      And no one knew if an hour had passed, or a year, for time stood
      still and it was as if all creation held its breath. And Jesus
      opened his eyes, and the scent of blossoms filled the air as Jesus
      spoke: "Here is the secret, Sons of Light; here in the humble
      grass. Here is the meeting place of the Earthly Mother and the
      Heavenly Father; here is the Stream of Life which gave birth to
      all creation; I tell you truly, only to the Son of Man is it given
      to see and hear and touch the Stream of Life which flows between
      the Earthly and Heavenly Kingdoms. Place your hands around the
      tender grass of the angel of Earth, and you will see and hear and
      touch the power of all the angels."<br>
      <br>
      And one by one, each of the Brothers sat in reverence before the
      power of the angels, holding in his hands the tender grass. And
      each one felt the Stream of Life enter his body with the force of
      a rushing stream after a spring storm. And the power of the angels
      flowed into their hands, up into their arms, and shook them
      mightily, even as the wind of the north shakes the branches of
      trees. And all of them wondered at the power in the humble grass,
      that it could contain all the angels, and the kingdoms of the
      Earthly Mother and the Heavenly Father. And they sat before Jesus,
      and were taught by him.<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus said: "Behold, Sons of Light, the lowly grass. See
      wherein are contained all the angels of the Earthly Mother and the
      Heavenly Father. For now have you stepped into the Stream of Life,
      and its currents will carry you in time to everlasting life in the
      kingdom of your Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      "For in the grass are all the angels. Here is the angel of Sun,
      here in the brightness of the green color of the blades of wheat.
      For no one can look upon the sun when it is high in the heavens,
      for the eyes of the Son of Man are blinded by its radiant light.
      And it is for this that the angel of Sun turns to green all that
      to which she gives life, that the Son of Man may look upon the
      many and various shades of green and find strength and comfort
      therein. I tell you truly, all that is green and with life has the
      power of the angel of Sun within it, even these tender blades of
      young wheat.<br>
      <br>
      "And so does the angel of Water bless the grass, for I tell you
      truly, there is more of the angel of Water within the grass than
      any of the other angels of the Earthly Mother. For if you crush
      within your hands the grass, you will feel the water of life,
      which is the blood of the Earthly Mother. And all through the days
      when you touch the grass and enter into the Stream of Life, do you
      give to the soil a few drops of water, that the grass may be
      renewed by the power of the Angel of Water.<br>
      <br>
      "Know, also, that the angel of Air is within the grass, for all
      that is living and green is the home of the angel of Air. Put your
      face close to the grass, breathe deeply, and let the angel of Air
      enter deep within your body. For she abides in the grass, as the
      oak abides in the acorn, and as the fish abides in the sea.<br>
      <br>
      "The angel of Earth is she who gives birth to the grass, even as
      the babe in the womb lives from the nourishment of his mother, so
      does the earth give of itself to the grain of wheat, causing it to
      shoot forth to embrace the angel of Air. I tell you truly, each
      grain of wheat that bursts forth upward to the sky is a victory
      over death, where Satan reigns. For Life always begins again.<br>
      <br>
      "It is the angel of Life that flows through the blades of grass
      into the body of the Son of Light, shaking him with her power. For
      the grass is Life and the Son of Light is Life, and Life flows
      between the Son of Light and the blades of grass, making a bridge
      to the Holy Stream of Light which gave birth to all creation.<br>
      <br>
      "And when the Son of Light holds between his hands the blades of
      grass, it is the angel of joy which fills his body with music. To
      enter into the Stream of Life is to be one with the song of the
      bird, the colors of the wild flowers, the scent of the sheaves of
      grain, newly turned over in the fields. I tell you truly, when the
      Son of Man feels not joy in his heart, he labors for Satan and
      brings hope to the sons of darkness. There is no sadness in the
      kingdom of Light, only the angel of Joy. Learn, then, from the
      tender blades of grass the song of the angel of joy, that the Sons
      of Light may walk with her always and so comfort the hearts of the
      Sons of Men.<br>
      <br>
      "The Earthly Mother is she who provides for our bodies, for we are
      born of her, and have our life in her. So does she provide for us
      food in the very blades of grass we touch with our hands. For I
      tell you truly, it is not only as bread that wheat may nourish us.
      We may eat also of the tender blades of grass, that the strength
      of the Earthly Mother may enter into us. But chew well the blades,
      for the Son of Man has teeth unlike those of the beasts, and only
      when we chew well the blades of grass can the angel of Water enter
      our blood and give us strength. Eat, then, Sons of Light, of this
      most perfect herb from the table of our Earthly Mother, that your
      days may be long upon the earth, for such finds favor in the eyes
      of God.<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you truly, the angel of Power enters into you when you
      touch the Stream of Life through the blades of grass. For the
      angel of Power is as a shining light that surrounds every living
      thing, just as the full moon is encircled by rings of radiance,
      and as the mist rises up from the fields when the sun climbs in
      the sky. And the angel of Power enters into the Son of Light when
      his heart is pure and his desire is only to comfort and teach the
      Sons of Men. Touch, then, the blades of grass, and feel the angel
      of Power enter the tips of your fingers, flow upwards through your
      body, and shake you till you tremble with wonder and awe.<br>
      <br>
      "Know, also, that the angel of Love is present in the blades of
      grass, for love is in the giving, and great is the love given to
      the Sons of Light by the tender blades of grass. For I tell you
      truly, the Stream of Life runs through every living thing, and all
      that lives, bathes in the Holy Stream of Life. And when the Son of
      Light touches with love the blades of grass, so do the blades of
      grass return his love, and lead him to the Stream of Life where he
      may find life everlasting. And this love never exhausts itself,
      for its source is in the Stream of Life which flows into the
      Eternal Sea, and no matter how far does the Son of Man stray from
      his Earthly Mother and his Heavenly Father, the touch of the
      blades of grass will always bring a message from the angel of
      Love; and his feet shall bathe again in the Holy Stream of Life.<br>
      <br>
      "Lo, it is the angel of Wisdom that governs the movement of the
      planets, the circle of the seasons, and the orderly growth of all
      living things. So does the angel of Wisdom ordain the communion of
      the Sons of Light with the Stream of Life, through the tender
      blades of grass. For I tell you truly, your body is holy, because
      it bathes in the Stream of Life, which is Eternal Order.<br>
      <br>
      "Touch the blades of grass, Sons of Light, and touch the angel of
      Eternal Life. For if you look with the eyes of the spirit, you
      will truly see that the grass is eternal. Now it is young and
      tender, with the brightness of the newborn babe. Soon it will be
      tall and gracious, as the sapling tree with its first fruits. Then
      it will yellow with age, and bow its head in patience, as lies the
      field after the harvest. Finally, it will wither, for the small
      earthen pot cannot contain the full lifespan of the wheat. But it
      does not die, for the brown leaves return to the angel of Earth,
      and she holds the plant in her arms and bids it sleep, and all the
      angels work within the faded leaves and lo, they are changed and
      do not die but rise again in another guise. And so do the Sons of
      Light never see death, but find themselves changed and risen to
      everlasting Life.<br>
      <br>
      "And so does the angel of Work never sleep, but sends the roots of
      the wheat deep into the angel of Earth, that the shoots of tender
      green may overcome death and the reign of Satan. For life is
      movement, and the angel of Work is never still, even does he labor
      without ceasing in the vineyard of the Lord. Close your eyes when
      you touch the grass, Sons of Light, but fall not asleep, for to
      touch the Stream of Life is to touch the eternal rhythm of the
      everlasting kingdoms, and to bathe in the Stream of Life is to
      feel more and more the power of the angel of Work within you,
      creating on earth the kingdom of Heaven.<br>
      <br>
      "Peace is -the gift of the Stream of Life to the Sons of Light.
      Wherefore do we always greet each other, 'Peace be with you. Even
      so does the grass greet your body with the kiss of Peace. I tell
      you truly, Peace is not just the absence of war, for very quickly
      can the peaceful river turn into a raging torrent, and the same
      waves that lull the boat can quickly break it to pieces against
      the rocks. So does violence lie in wait for the Sons of Man, when
      they keep not the vigil of Peace. Touch the blades of grass, and
      thereby touch the Stream of Life. Therein you will find Peace, the
      Peace built with the power of all the angels. Even so with that
      Peace will the rays of Holy Light cast out all darkness.<br>
      <br>
      "When the Sons of Light are one with the Stream of Life, then will
      the power of the blades of grass guide them to the everlasting
      kingdom of the Heavenly Father. And you shall know more of those
      mysteries which is not yet time for you to hear. For there are
      other Holy Streams in the everlasting kingdoms; I tell you truly,
      the heavenly kingdoms are crossed and crossed again by streams of
      golden light, arching far beyond the dome of the sky and having no
      end. And the Sons of Light shall travel by these streams for ever,
      knowing not death, guided by the eternal love of the Heavenly
      Father. And I tell you truly, all these mysteries are contained in
      the humble grass, when you touch it with tenderness and open your
      heart to the angel of Life within.<br>
      <br>
      "Gather, then, the grains of wheat and plant them in small earthen
      pots; and every day with glad heart commune with the angels, that
      they may guide you to the Holy Stream of Life, and you may bring
      back from its eternal source comfort and strength for the Sons of
      Men. For I tell you truly, all that you learn, all that your eyes
      of the spirit see, all that your cars of the spirit hear, all this
      is as a hollow reed in the wind if you do not send forth a message
      of truth and light to the Sons of Men. For by the fruit do we know
      the worth of the tree. And to love is to teach without end,
      without ceasing. For so were your fathers taught of old, even our
      Father Enoch. Go now, and peace be with you."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus held forth the little pot with the blades of young
      grass, as if in blessing, and walked toward the sun-filled hills,
      along the shore of the river, as was the custom of all the
      Brothers. And the others followed, each holding to him the words
      of Jesus, as it were a precious jewel within his breast.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>THE SEVENFOLD PEACE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      "Peace be with you," spoke the Elder in greeting to the Brothers
      who had gathered for the teachings<br>
      <br>
      "Peace be with you," they answered; and they walked together along
      the bank of the river, for so was their custom when an Elder
      taught the Brothers, that they might share the teachings with the
      angels of the Earthly Mother: of air, of sun, of water, of earth,
      of life, and of joy.<br>
      <br>
      And the Elder said to the Brothers: "I would speak to you of
      peace, for of all the angels of the Heavenly Father, peace is that
      for which the world most yearns, as a tired babe longs to put his
      head on his mother's breast. It is the lack of peace that troubles
      the kingdoms, even when they are not at war. For violence and
      warfare may reign in a kingdom even when the sounds of clashing
      swords are not heard. Though no armies march one against the
      other, still there is no peace when the Sons of Men walk not with
      the angels of God. I tell you truly, many are those who do not
      know peace; for they are at war with their own body; they are at
      war with their thoughts; they have no peace with their fathers,
      their mothers, their children; they have no peace with their
      friends and neighbors; they know not the beauty of the Holy
      Scrolls; they labor not through the day in the kingdom of their
      Earthly Mother; nor do they sleep at night in the arms of their
      Heavenly Father. Peace reigns not within them, for ever do they
      thirst for that which in the end brings only misery and pain, even
      those trappings of riches and fame which Satan uses to tempt the
      Sons of Men; and they live in ignorance of the Law, even that Holy
      Law by which we live: the path of the angels of the Earthly Mother
      and the Heavenly Father."<br>
      <br>
      "How, then, may we bring peace to our brothers, Master?" asked
      some of the Elder, "for we would that all the Sons of Men share in
      the blessings of the angel of Peace."<br>
      <br>
      And he answered: "Truly, only he who is at peace with all the
      angels can shed the light of peace on others. Therefore, first be
      at peace with all the angels of the Earthly Mother and the
      Heavenly Father. For the winds of a storm stir and trouble the
      waters of the river, and only the stillness that follows can calm
      them once again. Take care when your brother asks you for bread,
      that you give him not stones. Live first in peace with all the
      angels, for then your peace will be as a fountain that does
      replenish itself with the giving, and the more you give, so the
      more you will be given, for such is the Law.<br>
      <br>
      "Three are the dwellings of the Son of Man, and no one may come
      before the face of God who knows not the angel of Peace in each of
      the three. These are his body, his thoughts, and his feelings.
      When the angel of Wisdom guides his thoughts, when the angel of
      Love purifies his feelings, and when the deeds of his body reflect
      both love and wisdom, then does the angel of Peace guide him
      unfailingly to the throne of his Heavenly Father. And he should
      pray without ceasing that the power of Satan with all his diseases
      and uncleannesses may be cast out of all of his three dwellings;
      that Power and Wisdom and Love may reign in his body, his
      thoughts, and his feelings.<br>
      <br>
      "First shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own body; for his
      body is as a mountain pond that reflects the sun when it is still
      and clear; but when it is full of mud and stones, it reflects
      nothing. First must Satan be cast out of the body, that the angels
      of God may enter again and dwell therein. Truly, no peace can
      reign in the body unless it is as a temple of the Holy Law.
      Therefore, when he who suffers with pains and grievous plagues
      asks for your help, tell him to renew himself with fasting and
      with prayer. Tell him to invoke the angel of sun, the angel of
      water, and the angel of air, that they may enter his body and cast
      out of it the power of Satan. Show him the baptism within, and the
      baptism without. Tell him always to eat of the table of our
      Earthly Mother, spread with her gifts: the fruits of the trees,
      the grasses of the fields, the milk of beasts good for eating, and
      the honey of bees. He shall not invoke the power of Satan by
      eating the flesh of beasts, for he who kills, kills his brother,
      and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts, eats the body of death.
      Tell him to prepare his food with the fire of life, not the fire
      of death, for the living angels of the living God serve only
      living men.<br>
      <br>
      "And though he sees them not, and hears them not, and touches them
      not, still is he every moment surrounded by the power of God's
      angels. While his eyes and ears are closed by ignorance of the Law
      and thirst for the pleasures of Satan, he will not see them, nor
      hear them, nor touch them. But when he fasts and prays to the
      living God to cast out all the diseases and uncleannesses of
      Satan, then will his eyes and ears be opened, and he will find
      peace.<br>
      <br>
      "For not only he suffers who harbors the diseases of Satan within
      him, but his mother, his father, his wife, his children, his
      companions, these suffer also, for no man is an island unto
      himself, and the powers that flow through him, whether they be of
      the angels or of Satan, truly these powers do unto others for good
      or for evil.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to our body the
      angel of Life to dwell therein for ever.'<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own thoughts; that
      the angel of Wisdom may guide him. For I tell you truly, there is
      no greater power in heaven and earth than the thoughts of the Son
      of Man. Though unseen by the eyes of the body, yet each thought
      has mighty strength, even such strength as can shake the heavens.<br>
      <br>
      "For to no other creature in the kingdom of the Earthly Mother is
      it given the power of thought, for all beasts that crawl and birds
      that fly, live not of their own thinking but of the one Law that
      governs all. Only to the Sons of Men is it given the power of
      thought, even that thought that can break the bonds of death. Do
      not think because it cannot be seen, that thought has no power. I
      tell you truly, the lightning that cleaves the mighty oak, or the
      quaking that opens up cracks in the earth, these are as the play
      of children compared with the power of thought. Truly each thought
      of darkness, whether it be of malice, or anger, or vengeance,
      these wreak destruction like that of fire sweeping through dry
      kindling under a windless sky. But man does not see the carnage,
      nor does he hear the piteous cries of his victims, for he is blind
      to the world of the spirit.<br>
      <br>
      "But when this power is guided by holy Wisdom, then the thoughts
      of the Son of Man lead him to the heavenly kingdoms and thus is
      paradise built on earth; then it is that your thoughts uplift the
      souls of men, as the cold waters of a rushing stream revive your
      body in the summer heat.<br>
      <br>
      "When first a fledgling bird tries to fly, his wings cannot
      support him, and he falls again and again to earth. But he tries
      again and one day he soars aloft, leaving earth and his nest far
      behind. So is it with the thoughts of the Sons of Men. The longer
      he walks with the angels and keeps their Law, so do the stronger
      his thoughts become in holy Wisdom. And I tell you truly, that day
      will come when his thoughts will overcome even the kingdom of
      death and soar to everlasting life in the heavenly kingdoms; for
      with their thoughts guided by holy Wisdom do the Sons of Men build
      a bridge of light thereby to reach God.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to our thoughts
      the angel of Power, that we may break the bonds of death.<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own feelings; that
      his family may delight in his loving kindness, even his father,
      his mother, his wife, his children, and his children's children.
      For the Heavenly Father is a hundred times greater than all
      fathers by seed and by blood, and the Earthly Mother is a hundred
      times greater than all mothers by the body, and your true brothers
      are all those who do the will of your Heavenly Father and of your
      Earthly Mother, and not your brothers by blood. Even so, shall you
      see the Heavenly Father in your father by seed, and your Earthly
      Mother in your mother by the body, for are not these also children
      of the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother? Even so shall you
      love your brothers by blood as you love all your true brothers who
      walk with the angels, for are not these also children of the
      Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother? I tell you truly, it is
      easier to love those newly met, than those of our own house, who
      have k nown our weaknesses, and heard our words of anger, and seen
      us in our nakedness, for they know us as we know ourselves, and we
      are ashamed. Then shall we call on the angel of Love to enter into
      our feelings, that they be purifiers And all that was before
      impatience and discord, will turn to harmony and peace, as the
      parched ground drinks in the gentle rain and becomes green and
      soft, tender with new life.<br>
      <br>
      "For many and grievous are the sufferings of the Sons of Men when
      they cleave not to the angel of Love. Truly, a man without love
      casts a dark shadow on everyone he meets, most of all those with
      whom he lives; his harsh and angry words fall on his brothers like
      fetid air rising from a stagnant pool. And he suffers most who
      speaks them, for the darkness that encloses him invites Satan and
      his devas.<br>
      <br>
      "But when he calls on the angel of Love, then is the darkness
      dispersed, and the light of sunshine streams from him, and the
      colors of the rainbow swirl about his head, and gentle rain falls
      from his fingers, and he brings peace and strength to all those
      who draw near to him.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to those of our
      seed and of our blood the angel of Love, that peace and harmony
      may dwell in our house for ever.'<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with other Sons of Men, even
      with the Pharisees and priests, even with beggars and the
      homeless, even with kings and governors. For all are Sons of Men,
      whatever be their station, whatever be their calling, whether
      their eyes have been opened to see the heavenly kingdoms, or
      whether they yet walk in darkness and ignorance.<br>
      <br>
      "For the justice of men may reward the undeserving and punish the
      innocent, but Holy Law is the same for all, whether beggar or
      king, whether shepherd or priest.<br>
      <br>
      "Seek peace with all the Sons of Men, and let it be known of the
      Brothers of Light, that we have lived according to the Holy Law
      since the time of Enoch of old, and before. For we are not rich,
      neither are we poor. And we do share all things, even our garments
      and the tools we use to till the soil. And together we work in the
      fields with all the angels, bringing forth the gifts of the
      Earthly Mother for all to eat.<br>
      <br>
      "For the strongest of the angels of the Heavenly Father, the angel
      of Work, blesses each man who works in the way best for him, for
      then shall he know neither want nor excess. Truly is there
      abundance for all men in the kingdoms of the Earthly Mother and
      the Heavenly Father when each man works at his task; for when a
      man shirks his task, then another must take it up, for we are
      given all things in the kingdoms of heaven and earth at the price
      of labor.<br>
      <br>
      "Always have the Brothers of Light lived where rejoice the angels
      of the Earthly Mother: near rivers, near trees, near flowers, near
      the music of birds; where sun and rain may embrace the body, which
      is the temple of the spirit. Nor do we have ought to do with the
      edicts of rulers; neither do we uphold them, as our law is the Law
      of the Heavenly Father and the Earthly Mother; neither do we
      oppose them, for no one rules save by the will of God. Rather do
      we strive to live according to the Holy Law and strengthen always
      that which is good in all things; then will the kingdom of
      darkness be changed to the kingdom of light; for where there is
      light, how then can darkness remain?<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to all humankind
      the angel of Work, that having a holy task we should not ask for
      any other blessing.'<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with the knowledge of the
      ages past; for I tell you truly, in the Holy Scrolls is a treasure
      a hundred times greater than any of jewels and gold in the richest
      of kingdoms, and more precious, for surely they contain all the
      wisdom revealed by God to the Sons of Light, even those traditions
      which came to us through Enoch of old, and before him on an
      endless path into the past, the teachings of the Great Ones. And
      these are our inheritance, even as the son inherits all the
      possessions of his father when he shows himself to be worthy of
      his father's blessing. Truly, by studying the teachings of ageless
      wisdom do we come to know God, for I tell you truly, the Great
      Ones saw God face to face; even so, when we read the Holy Scrolls
      do we touch the feet of God.<br>
      <br>
      "And when once we see with the eyes of wisdom and hear with the
      cars of understanding the ageless truths of the Holy Scrolls, then
      must we go among the Sons of Men and teach them, for if we
      jealously hide the holy knowledge, pretending that it belongs only
      to us, then we are as one who finds a spring high in the
      mountains, and rather than let it flow into the valley to quench
      the thirst of man and beast, buries it under rocks and dirt,
      thereby robbing himself of water, as well. Go among the Sons of
      Men and tell them of the Holy Law, that they may thereby save
      themselves and enter the heavenly kingdoms. But tell them in words
      they may understand, in parables from nature that speak to the
      heart, for the deed must first live as desire in the awakened
      heart.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to our knowledge
      the angel of Wisdom, that we may walk in the paths of the Great
      Ones who have seen the face of God.<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with the kingdom of his
      Earthly Mother, for none can live long, neither be happy, but he
      who honors his Earthly Mother and does her laws. For your breath
      is her breath; your blood her blood; your bone her bone; your
      flesh her flesh; your bowels her bowels; your eyes and your ears
      are her eyes and her ears.<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you truly, you are one with the Earthly Mother; she is in
      you, and you in her. Of her were you born, in her do you live, and
      to her shall you return again. it is the blood of our Earthly
      Mother which falls from the clouds and flows in the rivers; it is
      the breath of our Earthly Mother which, whispers in the leaves of
      the forest and blows with a mighty wind from the mountains; sweet
      and firm is the flesh of our Earthly Mother in the fruits of the
      trees; strong and unflinching are the bones of our Earthly Mother
      in the giant rocks and stones which stand as sentinels of the lost
      times; truly, we are one with our Earthly Mother, and he who
      clings to the laws of his Mother, to him shall his Mother cling
      also.<br>
      <br>
      "But there will come a day when the Son of Man will turn his face
      from his Earthly Mother and betray her, even denying his Mother
      and his birthright. Then shall he sell her into slavery, and her
      flesh shall be ravaged, her blood polluted, and her breath
      smothered; he will bring the fire of death into all the parts of
      her kingdom, and his hunger will devour all her gifts and leave in
      their place only a desert.<br>
      <br>
      "All these things will he do out of ignorance of the Law, and as a
      man dying slowly cannot smell his own stench, so will the Son of
      Man be blind to the truth: that as he plunders and ravages and
      destroys his Earthly Mother, so does he plunder and ravage and
      destroy himself. For he was born of his Earthly Mother, and he is
      one with her, and all that he does to his Mother9 even so does he
      do to himself.<br>
      <br>
      "Long ago, before the Great Flood, the Great Ones walked the
      earth, and the giant trees, even those which now are no more than
      legend, were their home and their kingdom. They lived many score
      of generations, for they ate from the table of the Earthly Mother,
      and slept in the arms of the Heavenly Father, and they knew not
      disease, old age, nor death. To the Sons of Men did they bequeath
      all the glory of their kingdoms, even the hidden knowledge of the
      Tree of Life which stands in the middle of the Eternal Sea. But
      the eyes of the Sons of Men were blinded by the visions of Satan,
      and by promises of power, even that power which conquers by might
      and by blood. And then did the Son of Man sever the golden threads
      that bound him to his Earthly Mother and his Heavenly Father; he
      stepped from the Holy Stream of Life where his body, his thoughts,
      and his feelings were one with the Law, and began to use only his
      own thoughts, his own feelings, and his own deeds, making hundreds
      of laws, where before there was only One.<br>
      <br>
      "And so did the Sons of Men exile themselves from their home, and
      ever since have they huddled behind their stone walls, hearing not
      the sighing of the wind in the tall trees of the forests beyond
      their towns.<br>
      <br>
      "I tell you truly, the Book of Nature is a Holy Scroll, and if you
      would have the Sons of Men save themselves and find everlasting
      life, teach them how once again to read from the living pages of
      the Earthly Mother. For in everything that is life is the law
      written. It is written in the grass, in the trees, in rivers,
      mountains, birds of the sky and fishes of the sea; and most of all
      within the Son of Man. Only when he returns to the bosom of his
      Earthly Mother will he find everlasting life and the Stream of
      Life which leads to his Heavenly Father; only then may the dark
      vision of the future come not to pass.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to the kingdom
      of our Earthly Mother the angel of joy, that our hearts may be
      full of singing and gladness as we nestle in the arms of our
      Mother.<br>
      <br>
      'At last, shall the Son of Man seek peace with the kingdom of his
      Heavenly Father; for truly, the Son of Man is only born of his
      father by seed and of his mother by the body, that he may find his
      true inheritance and know at last that he is the Son of the King.<br>
      <br>
      "The Heavenly Father is the One Law, who fashioned the stars, the
      sun, the light and the darkness, and the Holy Law within our
      souls. Everywhere is he, and there is nowhere he is not. All in
      our understanding, and all we know not, all is governed by the
      Law. The falling of leaves, the flow of rivers, the music of
      insects at night, all these are ruled by the Law.<br>
      <br>
      "In our Heavenly Father's realm there are many mansions, and many
      are the hidden things you cannot know of yet. I tell you truly,
      the kingdom of our Heavenly Father is vast, so vast that no man
      can know its limits, for there are none. Yet the whole of his
      kingdom may be found in the smallest drop of dew on a wild flower,
      or in the scent of newly-cut grass in the fields under the summer
      sun. Truly, there are no words to describe the kingdom of the
      Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      "Glorious, indeed, is the inheritance of the Son of Man, for to
      hirn only is it given to enter the Stream of Life which leads him
      to the kingdom of his Heavenly Father. But first he must seek and
      find peace with his body, with his thoughts, with his feelings,
      with the Sons of Men, with holy knowledge, and with the kingdom of
      the Earthly Mother. For I tell you truly, this is the vessel which
      will carry the Son of Man on the Stream of Life to his Heavenly
      Father. He must have peace that is sevenfold before he can know
      the one peace which surpasses understanding, even that of his
      Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      "After this manner, therefore, pray to your Heavenly Father, when
      the sun is high at midday: 'Our Father who art in heaven, send to
      all the Sons of Men your angel of Peace; and send to your kingdom,
      our Heavenly Father, your angel of Eternal Life, that we may soar
      beyond the stars and live for ever."<br>
      <br>
      And then the Elder was quiet, and a great stillness stole over the
      Brothers, and no one wished to speak. The shadows of late
      afternoon played on the river, still and silvery as glass, and in
      the darkening sky could faintly be seen the filigree crescent moon
      of peace. And the great peace of the Heavenly Father wrapt them
      all in deathless love.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>THE HOLY STREAMS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Into the innermost circle have you come, into the mystery of
      mysteries, that which was old when our father Enoch was young and
      walked the earth. Around and around have you come on your journey
      of many years, always following the path of righteousness, living
      according to the Holy Law and the sacred vows of our Brotherhood,
      and you have made of your body a holy temple wherein dwell the
      angels of God. Many years have you shared the daylight hours with
      the angels of the Earthly Mother; many years have you slept in the
      arms of the Heavenly Father, taught by his unknown angels. You
      have learned that the laws of the Son of Man are seven, of the
      angels three, and of God, one. Now you shall know of the three
      laws of the angels, the mystery of the three Holy Streams and the
      ancient way to traverse them; so shall you bathe in the light of
      heaven and at last behold the revelation of the mystery of
      mysteries: the law of God, which is One.<br>
      <br>
      Now in the hour before the rising of the sun, just before the
      angels of the Earthly Mother breathe life into the still sleeping
      earth, then do you enter into the Holy Stream of Life. It is your
      Brother Tree who holds the mystery of this Holy Stream, and it is
      your Brother Tree that you will embrace in your thought, even as
      by clay you embrace him in greeting when you walk along the lake
      shore. And you shall be one with the tree, for in the beginning of
      the times so did we all share in the Holy Stream of Life that gave
      birth to all creation. And as you embrace your Brother Tree, the
      power of the Holy Stream of Life will fill your whole body, and
      you will tremble before its might. Then breathe deeply of the
      angel of air, and say the word "Life" with the outgiving of
      breath. Then you will become in truth the Tree of Life which sinks
      its roots deep into the Holy Stream of Life from an eternal
      source. And as the angel of sun warms the earth, and all the
      creatures of land and water and air rejoice in the new day, so
      will your body and spirit rejoice in the Holy Stream of life that
      flows to you through your Brother Tree.<br>
      <br>
      And when the sun is high in the heavens, then shall you seek the
      Holy Stream of Sound. in the heat of noontide, all creatures are
      still and seek the shade; the angels of the Earthly Mother are
      silent for a space. Then it is that you shall let into your ears
      the Holy Stream of Sound; for it can only be heard in the silence.
      Think on the streams that are born in the desert after a sudden
      storm, and the roaring sound of the waters as they rush past.
      Truly, this is the voice of God, if you did but know it. For as it
      is written, in the beginning was the Sound, and the Sound was with
      God, and the Sound was God. I tell you truly, when we are born, we
      enter the world with the sound of God in our ears, even the
      singing of the vast chorus of the sky, and the holy chant of the
      stars in their fixed rounds; it is the Holy Stream of Sound that
      traverses the vault of stars and crosses the endless kingdom of
      the Heavenly Father. It is ever in our ears, so do we hear it not.
      Listen for it, then, in the silence of noontide; bathe in it, and
      let the rhythm of the music of God beat in your ears until you are
      one with the Holy Stream of Sound. It was this Sound which formed
      the earth and the world, and brought forth the mountains, and set
      the stars in their thrones of glory in the highest heavens.<br>
      <br>
      And you shall bathe in the Stream of Sound, and the music of its
      waters shall flow over you; for in the beginning of the times so
      did we all share in the Holy Stream of Sound that gave birth to
      all creation. And the mighty roaring of the Stream of Sound will
      fill your whole body, and you will tremble before its might. Then
      breathe deeply of the angel of air, and become the sound itself,
      that the Holy Stream of Sound may carry you to the endless kingdom
      of the Heavenly Father, there where the rhythm of the world rises
      and falls.<br>
      <br>
      And when darkness gently closes the eyes of the angels of the
      Earthly Mother, then shall you also sleep, that your spirit may
      join the unknown angels of the Heavenly Father. And in the moments
      before you sleep, then shall you think of the bright and glorious
      stars, the white, shining, far-seen and far-piercing stars. For
      your thoughts before sleep are as the bow of the skilful archer,
      that sends the arrow where he wills. Let your thoughts before
      sleep be with the stars; for the stars are Light, and the Heavenly
      Father is Light, even that Light which is a thousand times
      brighter than the brightness of a thousand suns. Enter the Holy
      Stream of Light, that the shackles of death may loose their hold
      for ever, and breaking free from the bonds of earth, ascend the
      Holy Stream of Light through the blazing radiance of the stars,
      into the endless kingdom of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      Unfold your wings of light, and in the eye of your thought, soar
      with the stars into the farthest reaches of heaven, where untold
      suns blaze with light. For at the beginning of the times, the Holy
      Law said, let there be Light, and there was Light. And you shall
      be one with it, and the power of the Holy Light Stream will fill
      your whole body, and you will tremble before its might. Say the
      word "Light," as you breathe deeply of the angel of air, and you
      will become the Light itself; and the Holy Stream will carry you
      to the endless kingdom of the Heavenly Father, there losing itself
      in the eternal Sea of Light which gives birth to all creation. And
      you shall be one with the Holy Stream of Light, always before you
      sleep in the arms of the Heavenly Father.<br>
      <br>
      I tell you truly, your body was made not only to breathe, and eat,
      and think, but it was also made to enter the Holy Stream of Life.
      And your ears were made not only to hear the words of men, the
      song of birds, and the music of falling rain, but they were also
      made to hear the Holy Stream of Sound. And your eyes were made not
      only to see the rising and setting of the sun, the ripple of
      sheaves of grain, and the words of the Holy Scrolls, but they were
      also made to see the Holy Stream of Light. One day your body will
      return to the Earthly Mother; even also your ears and your eyes.
      But the Holy Stream of Life, the Holy Stream of Sound, and the
      Holy Stream of Light, these were never born, and can never die.
      Enter the Holy Streams, even that Life, that Sound, and that Light
      which gave you birth; that you may reach the kingdom of the
      Heavenly Father and become one with him, even as the river empties
      into the far distant sea.<br>
      <br>
      More than this cannot be told, for the Holy Streams will take you
      to that place where words are no more, and even the Holy Scrolls
      cannot record the mysteries therein.<br>
