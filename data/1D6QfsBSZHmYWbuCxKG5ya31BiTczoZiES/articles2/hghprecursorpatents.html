      <br>
      Summary of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is to provide a
      growth-promoting preparation and a H-OL double-uplifting system to
      solve the above technical problems.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the above purpose, the present invention adopts the
      following technical solutions:<br>
      <br>
      A growth-promoting preparation and H-OL double-incends system is
      characterized in that the growth-promoting preparation is composed
      of zinc gluconate, alpinia, bio-calcium carbonate, L-lysine
      hydrochloride, and taurine, and each The weight ratio of the
      ingredients is 1:55:46:11:6. This growth-promoting preparation is
      combined with the application of the H-OL double-incendence system
      in promoting the growth of adolescents.<br>
      <br>
      The H-OL double-incendence system is an effective combination of
      the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system and the OL
      chondrocyte activation therapy after accurate detection of the
      cause, judging the increase potential, and differently increasing
      the development plan.<br>
      <br>
      The steps of the diagnosis and treatment of the H-OL double-incend
      system are as follows: using the X-ray method and the lateral
      position, if necessary, adding an oblique slice, to understand the
      growth and development status of the skeleton according to the
      conditions of the epiphyseal line, the epiphysis, and the
      skeleton; the epiphyseal line is close A black shadow of the
      femoral head. It belongs to a type of cartilage. After puberty
      begins to develop, it gradually begins to ossification. When it is
      completely ossified, people stop growing. The step of this
      examination is to select some sites to take X-rays, and then the
      professional doctor will measure according to the appearance of
      your bones. The pelvic pelvis will observe the skeletal osseous
      situation and determine the bone age. From the front to the back,
      the degree of ossification will be from low to high. From the
      anterior tibial superiorus to the posterior tibial superiorus and
      combined with the size of the epiphysis (whether the bilateral hip
      joints are normal, whether the size of the bilateral femoral head
      tibias is normal), the width of the epiphyseal line, and the
      degree of closure of the epiphyseal line, etc. Make evaluation
      conclusions! In the differential diagnosis should pay attention
      to: (1) the distal humerus see the fracture line, such as the
      fracture line in the metaphyseal end of the site should be
      supracondylar fracture; such as in the iliac lower growth plate
      and metaphysis Separation for the whole scorpion.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the normal elbow shaft, the longitudinal axis of
      the proximal humerus can pass through the center of the radial
      head. Can be seen in the supracondylar fracture: metaphyseal
      imitation of the visible fracture line; full septum separation:
      the metaphysis see the "board sign" or "angle sign", the elbow
      visible ring swelling; (3) proximal humerus The longitudinal axis
      is not seen through the center of the radial head; the external
      skull of the cuboid is swollen, tender, and often touches the
      fracture block; elbow dislocation: the posterior elbow triangle
      disappears; (4) &lt;1 year old baby with small zygomatic bone The
      head has not yet appeared. The above method is not applicable. It
      is often misdiagnosed as dislocation of the elbow joint. This case
      is first considered as full separation.<br>
      <br>
      Through the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system,
      high-concentration nanometer series of traditional Chinese
      medicine prescriptions and the above-mentioned growth promoting
      preparations are used; the natural secretion of auxin is
      stimulated, pituitary cells are stimulated and repaired, and a
      large number of osteoblasts are continuously generated, thereby
      prolonging the length of long bones, and simultaneously enhancing
      the The uptake and use of important elements such as sodium,
      potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and sulfur promote the metabolism
      of the human body and allow the body to grow naturally.<br>
      <br>
      Through OL chondrocyte activation therapy, the motility of human
      osteoblasts, chondrocytes and tendon bursa cysts is stimulated to
      continuously divide and proliferate under the action of human
      growth hormone, accumulate in the space of long bones, and promote
      osteoarticular cartilage and osteophyte. Cartilage growth, long
      bone growth. And can further extend the growth cycle of iliac
      cartilage, postpone the closing time of the epiphyseal line, so as
      to achieve the purpose of efficient, rapid, sustained, stable and
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      The beneficial effects of the present invention: a
      growth-promoting preparation and a H-OL double-increased system,
      which adopts the HGH pituitary natural stimulation system, adopts
      a high-concentration nanometer-based traditional Chinese medicine
      prescription and the above-mentioned growth-promoting preparation,
      and stimulates the human body through OL chondrocyte activation
      therapy The activity of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and tendon
      bursa cells stimulates the natural secretion of auxin, stimulates
      and repairs the pituitary cells, and continues to produce a large
      number of osteoblasts, thereby prolonging the length of long
      bones. This therapy is mainly applied to males and females.
      Increased adolescence, increased adolescence, increased adulthood,
      precocious puberty, dwarfism, short stature, and stunted growth
      have a good therapeutic effect.<br>

      ...I actually tried the Ultra Lab HGC, for a short time period of
      3 months. I had a back problem. It miraculously healed. It hurt
      like it had just been injured, and then healed. The same thing
      with my knees, which I had injured more than a decade before -
      they hurt like I had just injured them all over again and then
      healed. I have had zero problems with either since 2003, they were
      permanently and lastingly healed.<br>
      <br>
      I was worried about side effects from a product that powerful and
      stopped taking it, not realizing it would soon be gone. The
      benefits lasted until now (and are still lasting.) If you look on
      the web, the product that worked was "500 sub lingual pellets",
      the 126 tablet version you can actually find pictures of now was
      not as good, and now the product is entirely gone...<br>
      <br>
      Here is the ingredient list for the real, (500 pellet) version of
      <b>Ultra Lab HGC</b>.<br>
