        <b>Jeremy Howell</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The gift given by the wise men to the baby Jesus probably came
      across the deserts from Oman. The BBC's Jeremy Howell visits the
      country to ask whether a commodity that was once worth its weight
      in gold could be reborn as a treatment for cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Oman's Land of Frankincense is an 11-hour drive southwards from
      the capital, Muscat.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the journey is through Arabia's Empty Quarter - hundreds
      of kilometres of flat, dun-coloured desert. Just when you are
      starting to think this is the only scenery you will ever see
      again, the Dhofar mountains appear in the distance.<br>
      <br>
      On the other side are green valleys, with cows grazing in them.
      The Dhofar region catches the tail-end of India's summer monsoons,
      and they make this the most verdant place on the Arabian
      peninsula.<br>
      <br>
      Warm winters and showery summers are the perfect conditions for
      the Boswellia sacra tree to produce the sap called frankincense.
      These trees grow wild in Dhofar. A tour guide, Mohammed Al-Shahri
      took me to Wadi Dawkah, a valley 20 km inland from the main city
      of Salalah, to see a forest of them.<br>
      <br>
      "The records show that frankincense was produced here as far back
      as 7,000 BC," he says. He produces an army knife. He used to be a
      member of the Sultan's Special Forces. With a practised flick, he
      cuts a strip of bark from the trunk of one of the Boswellia sacra
      trees. Pinpricks of milky-white sap appear on the wood and, very
      slowly, start to ooze out.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first cut. But you don't gather this sap," he says.
      "It releases whatever impurities are in the wood. The farmers
      return after two or three weeks and make a second, and a third,
      cut. Then the sap comes out yellow, or bright green, or brown or
      even black. They take this."<br>
      <br>
      Shortly afterwards, a frankincense farmer arrives in a pick-up
      truck. He is white-bearded, wearing a brown thobe and the
      traditional Omani, paisley-patterned turban.<br>
      <br>
      He is 67-year-old Salem Mohammed from the Gidad family. Most of
      the Boswellia sacra trees grow on public land, but custom dictates
      that each forest is given to one of the local families to farm,
      and Wadi Dawkah is his turf.<br>
      <br>
      He has an old, black, iron chisel with which he gouges out clumps
      of dried frankincense.<br>
      <br>
      "We learnt about frankincense from our forefathers and they learnt
      it from theirs" he says. "The practice has been passed down
      through the generations. We exported the frankincense, and that's
      how the families in Dhofar made their livings."<br>
      <br>
      And what an export trade it was. Frankincense was sent by camel
      train to Egypt, and from there to Europe. It was shipped from the
      ancient port of Sumharan to Persia, India and China. Religions
      adopted frankincense as a burnt offering.<br>
      <br>
      That is why, according to Matthew's Gospel in the Bible, the Wise
      Men brought it as a gift to the infant Jesus. Gold: for a king.
      Frankincense: for God. Myrrh: to embalm Jesus' body after death.<br>
      <br>
      The Roman Empire coveted the frankincense trade. In the first
      century BCE, Augustus Caesar sent 10,000 troops to invade what the
      Romans called Arabia Felix to find the source of frankincense and
      to control its production. The legions, marching from Yemen, were
      driven back by the heat and the aridity of the desert. They never
      found their Eldorado.<br>
      <br>
      Oman's frankincense trade went into decline three centuries ago,
      when Portugal fought Oman for dominance of the sea routes in the
      Indian and the Pacific Oceans.<br>
      <br>
      The Haffa souk in Salalah<br>
      Salalah's Haffa souk: The place to buy Omani brands such as Royal
      Hougari<br>
      <br>
      Nowadays, hardly any Omani frankincense is exported. Partly, this
      is because bulk buyers, such as the Roman Catholic Church, buy
      cheaper Somalian varieties. Partly, it is because Omanis now
      produce so little.<br>
      <br>
      "Years ago, 20 families farmed frankincense in this area," says
      Salem Mohammed Gidad. "But the younger generation can get
      well-paid jobs in the government and the oil companies, with
      pensions. Now, only three people still produce frankincense around
      here. The trade is really, really tiny!"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cancer hope</b><br>
      <br>
      But immunologist Mahmoud Suhail is hoping to open a new chapter in
      the history of frankincense.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have observed that there is some agent within
      frankincense which stops cancer spreading, and which induces
      cancerous cells to close themselves down. He is trying to find out
      what this is.<br>
      <br>
      "Cancer starts when the DNA code within the cell's nucleus becomes
      corrupted," he says. "It seems frankincense has a re-set function.
      It can tell the cell what the right DNA code should be.<br>
      <br>
      "Frankincense separates the 'brain' of the cancerous cell - the
      nucleus - from the 'body' - the cytoplasm, and closes down the
      nucleus to stop it reproducing corrupted DNA codes."<br>
      <br>
      Working with frankincense could revolutionise the treatment of
      cancer. Currently, with chemotherapy, doctors blast the area
      around a tumour to kill the cancer, but that also kills healthy
      cells, and weakens the patient. Treatment with frankincense could
      eradicate the cancerous cells alone and let the others live.<br>
      <br>
      The task now is to isolate the agent within frankincense which,
      apparently, works this wonder. Some ingredients of frankincense
      are allergenic, so you cannot give a patient the whole thing.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Suhail (who is originally from Iraq) has teamed up with medical
      scientists from the University of Oklahoma for the task.<br>
      <br>
      In his laboratory in Salalah, he extracts the essential oil from
      locally produced frankincense. Then, he separates the oil into its
      constituent agents, such as Boswellic acid.<br>
      <br>
      "There are 17 active agents in frankincense essential oil," says
      Dr Suhail. "We are using a process of elimination. We have cancer
      sufferers - for example, a horse in South Africa - and we are
      giving them tiny doses of each agent until we find the one which
      works."<br>
      <br>
      "Some scientists think Boswellic acid is the key ingredient. But I
      think this is wrong. Many other essential oils - like oil from
      sandalwood - contain Boswellic acid, but they don't have this
      effect on cancer cells. So we are starting afresh."<br>
      <br>
      The trials will take months to conduct and whatever results come
      out of them will take longer still to be verified. But this is a
      blink of the eye in the history of frankincense.<br>
      <br>
      Nine thousand years ago, Omanis gathered it and burnt it for its
      curative and cleansing properties. It could be a key to the
      medical science of tomorrow.<br>

        Studies on Frankincense and Cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>History:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Frankincense trees were considered extremely valuable during
      ancient times and their location was often a matter of state
      secret. Egyptians used the incense to fumigate their homes, for
      ritual incense and the oil for cosmetics. It was used as a holy
      anointing oil and as a general cure-all for all diseases. It was
      also used to enhance meditation and elevate spiritual
      consciousness. History shows it was used for embalming and as a
      perfume AND formed an important part of the Sabbath day offering.
      Frankincense or olibanum was mentioned inthe Scriptures over 50
      times and is found in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
      Chronicles, Nehemiah,Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Matthew, and
      Revelations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Actions:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The actions of frankincense include anti-inflammatory,
      anti-tumoral, immune-stimulant, antidepressant and muscle
      relaxing. It stimulates the limbic system as well as the
      hypothalamus, pineal and pituitary glands. It is strongly
      anti-viral, antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, antiseptic and
      expectorant oil. Frankincense has the ability to relax and
      revitalize at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Research:</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Cancer Research Using Frankincense</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>There are a few researchers studying the effects of
      frankincense on various cancers with some degree of success. In
      vitro effects show inhibition or stimulation of cell proliferation
      depending on the concentration of frankincense oil in the growth
      media.<br>
      <br>
      A recent study conducted at the University of Oklahoma showed that
      frankincense kills bladder cancer cells without harming
      surrounding tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Studies are showing frankincense to be a strong immune-stimulant
      with some claiming that frankincense has the ability to repair
      DNA.<br>
      <br>
      A Chinese study conducted in 2000, indicated that Boswellia has
      “anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor activities.” These boswellic
      acids from frankincense inhibited “a variety of malignant cells”
      in people suffering from leukemia and brain tumors.<br>
      <br>
      The Cancer Research Institute of the University of Nevada treated
      cervical cancer with frankincense, in which “there was 72%
      inhibition and growth of non-cancerous cells.”<br>
      <br>
      Other studies have shown that boswellic acids from frankincense
      exert anti-prolifertive activity toward a variety of malignant
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Another study showed that boswellic acids are potent apoptotic
      agents to cancer cells and another one shows that Boswellic acids
      from frankincense gum exhibit potent cytotoxic activity againstCNS
      tumors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why Hasn’t the General Public Heard about This?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It sounds incredulous but the anti-cancerous effects of
      frankincense has been known for thousands of years. Does it work
      for everyone? No, but compared to the effects of chemotherapy,
      frankincense DOES show great promise now and in the future.
      Frankincense will never be promoted for the breakthrough that it
      is because there is no money to be made in its promotion.
      Frankincense is expensive in comparison to other therapeutic grade
      oils but “cheap” in comparison to drugs like chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have observed and do agree that there is some agent
      within frankincense which stops cancer spreading, and which
      induces cancerous cells to close themselves down. Immunologist
      Mahmoud Suhail is quoted "Cancer starts when the DNA code within
      the cell's nucleus becomes corrupted. It seems frankincense has a
      re-set function. It can tell the cell what the right DNA code
      should be. Frankincense separates the 'brain' of the cancerous
      cell - the nucleus - from the 'body' - the cytoplasm, and closes
      down the nucleus to stop it reproducing corrupted DNA
      codes."--Currently, with chemotherapy, doctors blast the area
      around a tumour to kill the cancer, but that also kills healthy
      cells, and weakens the patient. Treatment with frankincense could
      eradicate the cancerous cells alone and let the others live.The
      task now is to isolate the agent within frankincense which,
      apparently, works this wonder<br>
      <br>
      <b>History Medical Research (Bosellia serrata)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Ayurvedic medicine Indian frankincense (Boswellia serrata),
      commonly referred to as "dhoop," has been used for hundreds of
      years for treating arthritis, healing wounds, strengthening the
      female hormone system, and purifying the atmosphere from
      undesirable germs. The use of frankincense in Ayurveda is called
      "dhoopan". In Indian culture, it is suggested that burning
      frankincense everyday in house brings good health.<br>
      <br>
      Standardized preparations of Indian frankincense from Boswellia
      serrata are being investigated in scientific studies as a
      treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and osteoarthritis. Initial clinical
      study results indicate efficacy of incense preparations for
      Crohn's disease. For therapy trials in ulcerativecolitis, asthma,
      and rheumatoid arthritis there are only isolated reports and pilot
      studies from which there is not yet sufficient evidence of safety
      and efficacy. Similarly, the long-term effects and side effects of
      taking frankincense has not yet been scientifically investigated.
      Boswellic acid in vitro antiproliferative effects on various tumor
      cell lines (such as melanoma, glioblastomas, liver cancer) are
      based on induction of apoptosis. A positive effect has been found
      in the use of incense on the accompanying specimens of brain
      tumors, although in smaller clinical trials. Some scientists say
      the results are due to methodological flaws. The main active
      compound of Indian incense is viewed as being boswellic acid.<br>
      <br>
      As of May 2008 FASEB Journal announced that Johns Hopkins
      University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have determined
      that frankincense smoke is a psychoactive drug that relieves
      depression and anxiety in mice. The researchers found that the
      chemical compound in censole acetate is responsible for the
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      In a different study, an enriched extract of "Indian Frankincense"
      (usually Boswellia serrata) was used in a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of patients with
      osteoarthritis. Patients receiving the extract showed significant
      improvement in their arthritis in as little as seven days. The
      compound caused no major adverse effects and, according to the
      study authors, is safe for human consumption and long-term use.<br>
      <br>
      The study was funded by a company which produces frankincense
      extract, and that the results have not yet been duplicated by
      another study.<br>
      <br>
      In a study published in March 2009 by the University of Oklahoma
      Health Sciences Center it was reported that"Frankincense oil
      appears to distinguish cancerous from normal bladder cells and
      suppress cancer cell viability<br>
      <br>
      <b>Study: Frankincense may fight some cancers</b><b><br>
      </b><b>January 31, 2006</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>A Virginia Tech scientist says frankincense oil might be
      useful in treating malignant melanoma -- an aggressive cancer that
      attacks humans and equines.<br>
      <br>
      Approximately 54,000 malignant melanoma cases are diagnosed
      annually, according to the American Cancer Society, and there are
      many similarities between malignant melanoma in horses and
      malignant melanoma in people.<br>
      <br>
      Recognizing the opportunity for translational research, John
      Robertson, a professor in the Virginia-Maryland Regional College
      of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech, has been studying the
      disease and an experimental treatment involving frankincense oil.<br>
      <br>
      Frankincense is a botanical oil distillate made from fermented
      plants that contains boswellic acid, a component known to have
      anti-neoplastic properties.<br>
      <br>
      During a recent presentation before a regional meeting of the
      American Cancer Society in Roanoke, Va., Robertson -- director of
      the college's Center for Comparative Oncology -- said he's found
      the oil has fairly selective anti-tumor activity and doesn't
      appear to disrupt normal cells."I think this research on
      frankincense oil suggests that this ancient medicine may have
      significant modern uses for chemotherapy of non-resectable
      malignancies," said Robertson.<br>

      </b>Muscat: Omani researchers at the University of Nizwa have
      succeeded in producing a medicinally important compound from Omani
      frankincense, luban, for breast cancer treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ahmad Sulaiman Al Harrasi, holder of the University’s Chair of
      Oman’s Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, said
      researchers have succeeded in isolating and enhancing the
      percentage of AKBA found in the resin of Omani frankincense.<br>
      <br>
      AKBA (beta-boswellic acid, keto-beta-boswellic acid, and
      acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid) has been indicated in apoptosis,
      or death of cancer cells, in particular brain tumours and cells
      affected by leukaemia or colon cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Al Harrasi pointed out that the research was done under the
      chairmanship of Oman Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products
      at the Nizwa University and was funded jointly by the Oman
      Research Council and Nizwa University,<br>
      <br>
      This discovery, the Nizwa University scientist says, will play a
      vital medicinal as well as economic role. “AKBA is very costly,”
      he said, explaining the economic benefits to the country.<br>
      <br>
      Omani media have claimed that a “cure” for cancer had been found,
      which Al Harrasi denies.<br>
      <br>
      “We would like to dispel certain misgivings regarding our
      discovery,” Dr Al Harrasi told Gulf News over the phone from
      Nizwa, about 160km northwest of Muscat.<br>
      <br>
      “We have not discovered a breast cancer cure and it is not from
      oil as reported in some media and being circulated on WhatsApp as
      well as social media,” he added<br>
      <br>
      The Assistant Dean for Scientific Studies and Research in Nizwa
      University also clarified that the compound had not been tested on
      humans. “We experimented on various cancer cell alliances for our
      research,” he clarified, adding that their experiments on several
      cancer cells showed positive results.<br>
      <br>
      He also revealed that patent registration process was under
      process and 60 to 70 per cent of work was done. “The draft [for
      patent] has been accepted,” he said<br>

      <b>Frankincense oil - a potential treatment option for bladder
        cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An enriched extract of the Somalian Frankincense herb Boswellia
      carteri has been shown to kill off bladder cancer cells.
      Frankincense oil is prepared from aromatic hardened gum resins
      obtained by tapping Boswellia trees. One of the main components of
      frankincense oil is boswellic acid, a component known to have
      anti-neoplastic properties. Research presented in the peer
      reviewed journal, BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine found
      that&nbsp; Frankincense oil might represent an alternative
      intravesical agent for bladder cancer treatment.<br>
      <br>
      HK Lin and his team, from the University of Oklahoma Health
      Sciences Center and Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, set out to
      evaluate frankincense oil for its anti-tumour activity in bladder
      cancer cells. The authors investigated the effects of the oil in
      two different types of cells in culture: human bladder cancer
      cells and normal bladder cells. The team found that frankincense
      oil is able to discriminate between normal and cancerous bladder
      cells in culture, and specifically kill cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Within a range of concentration, frankincense oil suppressed cell
      viability in bladder transitional carcinoma J82 cells but not in
      UROtsa cells. Comprehensive gene expression analysis confirmed
      that frankincense oil activates genes that are responsible for
      cell cycle arrest, cell growth suppression, and apoptosis in J82
      cells. However, frankincense oil-induced cell death in J82 cells
      did not result in DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis.<br>

      New salts or ion-pair complexes obtained by a reaction between
      boswellic acids or selectively enriched
      3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) or
      11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (KBA) compounds obtained through a new
      improved process, and an organic amine, more particularly with
      glucosamine. These salts or ion pair complexes are useful in
      nutraceuticals and in food supplements for anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic treatment of joints and cancer prevention or cancer
      therapeutic agents. These salts or ion pair complexes could also
      be used in cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition for external
      treatment of body parts or organs to treat inflammatory diseases
      or cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to novel salts or ion pair complexes
      of substituted/unsubstituted boswellic acid with certain organic
      bases particularly though not exclusively with glucosamine. This
      invention also includes an improved process for selectively
      enriching 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid and
      11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid hereinafter referred as (AKBA) and
      (KBA) respectively from an extract containing a mixture of
      boswellic acids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Inflammation is a critical protective biological process
      triggered by irritation, injury or infection, characterized by
      redness and heat, swelling, loss of function and pain. In addition
      to the foregoing induced conditions, inflammation can also occur
      due to age related factors. Life expectancy of general population
      has increased dramatically during the past few decades due to
      efficient control of infectious diseases and better access to
      nutritious food. This positive enhancement in life span coupled
      with changing environmental conditions elevated the incidence of
      chronic age-related diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, cancer,
      cardiovascular diseases, etc. Chronic inflammatory condition and
      cancer have become emerging health concerns in a number of
      countries across the globe and for people among all cultures.
      Arthritis is one of the most debilitating diseases of modem times.
      The quality of life for sufferers of these two diseases and their
      families is severely affected. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs are most commonly used remedies for rheumatic diseases.
      Presently, there has been a tremendous surge in demand for natural
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because of their
      established safety and efficacy, through decades of usage by
      various cultures.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The inflammatory and carcinogenesis processes are known to
      be triggered by increased metabolic activity of arachidonic acid.
      Arachidonic acid diverges down into two main pathways during this
      process, the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways.
      The COX pathways lead to prostaglandin and thromboxane production
      and the LOX pathways leads to leukotrienes (LTS) and hydroxyl
      eicosatetetraenoic acid (HETEs). These classes of inflammatory
      molecules exert profound biological effects, which enhance the
      development and progression of human cancers,<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Leukotrienes and 5(S)-HETE are important mediators for
      inflammatory, allergic and obstructive process. Leukotrienes
      increase micro vascular permeability and are potent chemotactic
      agents. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase indirectly reduces the
      expression of TNF-[alpha] (a cytokine that plays a key role in
      inflammation). 5-Lipoxygenase is therefore the target enzyme for
      identifying inhibitors, which have potential to cope with a
      variety of inflammations and hypersensitivity-based human diseases
      including asthma, arthritis, bowel diseases such as ulcerative
      colitis and circulatory disorders such as shock and ischaemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Similarly prostaglandins are intercellular messengers that
      are produced in high concentration at the sites of chronic
      inflammation and are capable of causing vasodilation, increased
      vascular permeability and sensitizing pain receptors. The
      pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE2) are produced by inducible
      isoform cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The prostaglandins that are
      important in gastrointestinal and renal function are produced by
      the constitutively expressed isoform, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
      COX-1 is the protective housekeeper isoform and it regulates
      mucosal cell production of mucous that provides a barrier between
      the acid and pepsin present in gastric secretions. Non-selective
      COX inhibitors thus produce serious side effects. Scientists
      around the world are thus investing a major effort in identifying
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase
      and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes. As both COX-2 and 5-LOX are commonly
      expressed in any kind of inflammatory condition, efforts are
      currently being focused to obtain the so called dual acting
      anti-inflammatory drugs that are able to inhibit both COX-2 and
      5-LOX enzymes. Unfortunately, the odds of finding a new dual
      acting natural NSAID that can truly alleviate the symptoms of
      inflammatory diseases are very thin. Hence, the researchers
      conceived the idea that using a combination of drugs, one having
      the COX-2 inhibitory activity and the other having 5-LOX
      inhibitory activity, as the next best option.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition
      that affects the lubricating mechanism and cushioning of joints.
      As a result of this autoimmune disease the bone surfaces are
      destroyed, which leads to stiffness, swelling, fatigue and
      crippling pain. Osteoarthritis is the common form of arthritis and
      results primarily from progressive degeneration of cartilage
      glycoaminoglycons. The damage is often compounded by a diminished
      ability to restore and repair joint structures including
      cartilage. The smooth surface of the cartilage becomes hard and
      rough creating friction. As a result of this the joint gets
      deformed, painful and stiff. Studies have indicated that over 40
      million Americans have osteoarthritis, including 80% of persons
      over the age of 50. The major focus for osteoarthritis treatment,
      should therefore involve agents that not only stimulate the
      production of biological substances necessary for regeneration of
      cartilage cells and proper joint function but also diminish pain
      inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide a salt or ion pair complex as a dietary supplement, that
      exhibits anti-arthritic properties without deleterious side
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0008] Boswellic Acids</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] Gum resin of Boswellia species known as Indian frankincense
      has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in Traditional
      Ayurvedic Medicine in India. Ancient Ayurvedic texts described its
      therapeutic use. Clinical trails performed by CSIR laboratories in
      India have shown fair to excellent results in 88% of the patients,
      with no adverse side effects (Singh, G. B., Status report,
      anti-inflammatory drugs from plant sources, 1982). A randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials on patients with
      osteo-arthritis of knee exhibited statistically significant
      improvement in the pain, decreased swelling and increased knee
      flexion etc. (Kimmatkar, Phytomedicine, 2003, 10, 3-7), The
      therapeutic effects shown by Boswellia serrata extract were
      comparable to those exhibited by sulfasalazine and mesalazine in
      patients with ulcerative colitis. (Gupta, I., et al., Eur. J. Med.
      Res., 1998, 3, 511-14 and Gerhardt, H., et. al., Gastroenterol.,
      2001, 39, 11-17). The source of anti-inflammatory actions has been
      attributed to boswellic acids (Safayhi, H., et al., Planta Medica,
      1997, 63, 487-493 and J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1992, 261,
      1143-46, both the journals published from USA), a group of
      triterpene acids isolated from the Boswellia resin (Pardhy, R. S.,
      et al., Indian J. Chem., 1978, 16B, 176-178). These compounds
      exert anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase
      (5-LOX). The boswellic acids also gained prominence recently for
      their antiproliferative actions. Boswellic acids inhibited several
      leukemia cell lines in vitro and inhibited melanoma growth and
      induced apoptosis (Hostanska, K., et al., Anticancer Res., 2002,
      22(5), 2853 -62). The acetyl boswellic acids were found to be
      unique class of dual inhibitors of human topoisomerases I and II a
      (Syrovets, T. et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 2000, 58(1), 71-81).
      Immunomodulatory activity of boswellic acids had been reported by
      Sharma et al. in Phytotheraphy Research, 1996, 10, 107-112,
      published from USA. A detailed study on the structural
      requirements for boswellic acids indicated that of all the six
      acids, 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid, hereinafter
      referenced as AKBA shows most pronounced inhibitory activity
      against 5-LOX (Sailer, E. R., et al., British J. Pharmacology,
      1996, 117, 615-618). AKBA acts by unique mechanism, in which it
      binds to 5-LOX in a calcium-dependent and reversible manner and
      acts as a non-redox-type, non-competitive inhibitor (Sailer, E.
      R., et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1998, 256, 364-368). The AKBA or a
      plant extract or composition containing it was reported to be
      effective for topical application, as an agent to soften lines
      and/or relax the skin (Alain, M., et. al., U.S. patent application
      No. 2004/0166178, dated Aug. 26, 2004). AKBA has thus become the
      subject of intensive research for its potential for the treatment
      of chronic inflammatory disorders.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0010] Glucosamine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Glucosamine is a natural substance found in high quantities
      in joint structures. The main function of glucosamine in joint
      structures is to produce cartilage components necessary for
      maintaining and repair joint tissue. Glucosamine stimulates the
      formation of joint structural components such as collagen, the
      protein of the fibrous substances that holds the joints together
      and helps to build-up the cartilage matrix, Collagen is the main
      component of the shock-absorbing cushion called articular
      cartilage. It is also a necessary nutrient in the production of
      synovial fluid. Some people may lose the ability with age to
      produce glucosamine, thereby inhibiting the grpwth of cartilage
      destroyed during wear and tear in osteoarthritis patients
      (Towheed, T. E., Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2003, 49, 601-604).
      When taken orally as a dietary supplement in the form of
      glucosamine sulfate, it has been shown to exert protective effect
      against joint destruction and is selectively used by joint tissues
      to promote healthy joint function and show potential therapeutic
      effect in osteoarthritis (Perry, G. H., et al., Ann. Rheum. Dis.,
      1972, 31, 440-448).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Several double-blind studies with glucosamine sulfate
      showed therapeutic effects comparable to or even better than non
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in relieving the symptoms of
      osteoarthritis (Vaz, A. L., Curr. Med, Res. Opin., 1982, 8,
      145-149; D'Ambrosia, E. D., et al., Pharmatherapeutica, 1982, 2,
      504-508 and Tapadinhas, M. J., et al., Pharmatherapeutica, 1982,
      3, 157-168). The NSAIDs offer only symptomatic relief, whereas
      glucosamine addresses the root cause of osteoarthritis disease. It
      support body's natural ability to tackle the disease on its own by
      providing the building blocks to many structural components such
      as glucosaminoglycons to repair the damage caused by
      osteoarthritis. Glucosamine hydrochloride is used for this study.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] The organic solvent extract of the gum resin of Boswellia
      serrata contain a total of six boswellic acids and two timcallic
      acids. These acids are shown in FIG. 1, and are represented by B1,
      B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, T1, T2 and T3. Studies have indicated AKBA as
      the most potent an anti-inflammatory agent among all the boswellic
      acids. The concentration of AKBA, indicated as B2 in the FIG. 1,
      amounts only in the range of 1-10% in the extract, but most often
      it is in the range of 2-3%. The potential usefulness of boswellic
      acids in general and AKBA in particular can be a great incentive
      to take-up further development of these compounds in all possible
      aspects.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention is aimed at selective enrichment of
      active compounds, KBA and AKBA to a therapeutically useful range
      such as 30% to 100% from natural Boswellia extract using a new
      improved process and then converting the enriched compounds to a
      salt or ion pair complex with enhanced solubility and improved
      therapeutic efficacy for use as an anti-arthritic dietary
      supplement. The salt or ion pair combination may be accomplished
      by using an acid function of the boswellic acid and an amine
      function from amino organic compounds, especially glucosamine.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The enrichment of AKBA from natural Boswellia extract was
      already described in international patent application (PCT #WO
      03/074063, dated. 12th September 2003) and also in US patents
      (application #20030199581, publication dated 23 Oct. 2003 and
      application #20040073060, publication dated 15 Apr. 2004). The
      processes described in these patents involve multi-step procedures
      and requires tedious work-up and chromatographic purifications.
      The present invention is an improved method, where in the
      acetylation and allylic oxidation steps are conducted in a single
      pot. This process eliminates the need for labor-intensive work-up
      following acetylation and time consuming product drying before
      proceeding to the oxidation step, as required by the processes
      reported in the patents and journal articles. This process also
      efficiently utilizes the un-reacted pyridine and acetic anhydride
      from the acetylation step to form highly active oxidizing systems
      such as CrO3/pyridine and CrO3/acetic anhydride. The present
      invention effectively reduces the overall reaction time for
      peracetylation and the oxidation steps. The new process eliminates
      the presence of possible chromium impurities in the KBA/AKBA
      enriched (30-40%) product by acid/base treatment without any need
      for chromatography.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A fraction enriched to 30-40% 11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid
      (KBA), can be accomplished by subjecting the crude mixture to
      basic treatment, followed by filtration and acidification of the
      mother liquor, and then separation of the white solid by
      filtration and drying, It was then reacetylated to obtain 30-40%
      AKBA enriched fraction, The fractions enriched to higher
      percentage (40-100%) of KBA and AKBA can be obtained by applying
      chromatographic methodology on hydrolysis mixture and
      re-acetylation mixture, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] An ionic salt or ion pair complex of boswellic acids
      containing AKBA in the range of 5 to 100% can be obtained by using
      appropriately enhanced boswellic compound and a suitable amine
      compound and adopting the representative procedure given in the
      examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] This invention relates to novel salts or ion pair complexes

      <br>
      [0025] We have disclosed a simple method by which salts or
      ion-pair complexes of boswellic acids with hetero-atom bases (also
      referred to as 'organic base') can be made for their inclusion in
      dietary or pharmaceutical compositions that provide reduction in
      inflammation and other health benefits. These salts or ion pair
      complexes are made by simple acid-base reaction, as shown in eq,
      1, between an organic acid (RCOOH) and an organic base (NR4R5R6).<br>
      <br>
      RCOOH+NR4R5R6-&gt;RCOO&lt;-+&gt;NHR4R5R6 (equation 1)<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The new composition according to this invention may be
      prepared by the following processes:<br>
      <br>
      (a) By reacting boswellic acids or ketoboswellic acid or acetyl
      ketoboswellic acid with organic base.<br>
      (b) By in situ generation of organic free base and reacting with
      boswellic acids or ketoboswellic acid or acetyl ketoboswellic
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In the first process, stoichiometric equivalents of the
      reactants are mixed to obtain the desired salts or ion pair
      complexes. Preferably, the reaction is initiated by the slow
      addition of organic free base, particularly, glucosamine free base
      to an aqueous methanolic solution of boswellic acids. Boswellic
      acids (48% by HPLC) may be obtained by a known process of
      extraction from the gum resin of Boswellia serrata. Glucosamine
      free base may be liberated from glucosamine hydrochloride by
      anionic exchange resin treatment. The enriched 11-ketoboswellic
      acid or 3-O-acetyl-11-ketoboswellic acid (30%-100%) was obtained
      from the gum-resin of Boswellia serrata using an improved method

      [0036] 1a). Single Pot Conversion of Boswellia Extract into AKBA
      Enriched Fraction:<br>
      <br>
      [0037] To a solution of Boswellia serrata extract (85%, 10 kg,) in
      pyridine (5.4 L), in a 100 L all glass reactor equipped with a
      water-cooled reflux condenser, was added acetic anhydride (4.2 L)
      at room temperature and the mixture was subjected to heating at
      60-65[deg.] C. under stirring. After 3 h, the mixture was cooled
      to ambient temperature and diluted with acetic acid (24 L) and
      acetic anhydride (24 L). The contents were cooled and treated
      slowly with chromium trioxide (6.4 kg) while maintaining the
      temperature under 40[deg.] C. The stirring was continued for
      another 2 h after the addition, and then the mixture was poured
      into ice water and the contents were mixed thoroughly. The solid
      was filtered, washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven to
      obtain a residue (14 kg). The HPLC analysis of the crude product
      showed complete conversion of boswellic acids B1, B4 and B6 to B2
      (AKBA).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] 1b). Isolation of 30-40%
      3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid: The above crude reaction
      mixture (5 kg) was added to 4N hydrochloric acid (45 L) and heated
      at 60[deg.] C. for 4 h. The mixture was cooled to ambient
      temperature and filtered. The precipitate was washed with 4N HCl,
      followed by water and dried in a vacuum oven to obtain AKBA
      enriched to 30-40% (2.8 kg).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] 1c). Isolation of 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid:
      The above, enriched compound (500 g) was subjected to silica
      column chromatography using 5% to 30% ethyl acetate/hexane
      mixtures. The fractions were monitored by TLC and those containing
      AKBA (30%-60%) were combined and subjected crystallization in
      hexane and ethyl acetate mixtures to obtain fractions enriched up
      to 85% AKBA, Repeated crystallization in the same solvent system
      yielded AKBA enriched up to 100%.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] 1d). Isolation of 11-keto-[beta]-bowellic acid:
      Alternatively, the crude mixture was dissolved in methanol and
      subjected to base treatment (8N KOH), The precipitate was
      separated by filtration and discarded. The mother liquor was
      acidified and the off-white precipitate was filtered, washed with
      water and dried under vacuum to obtain 30-40% ketoboswellic acid
      (KBA). The 11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid mixture (200 g) obtained
      was adsorbed on 250 g of silica gel and subjected column
      chromatography over 500 g of silica. The column was eluted with
      hexane, 10% ethyl acetate/hexane, 20% ethyl acetate/hexane and 30%
      ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures. The fractions were monitored by TLC
      and the fractions containing 11-keto-p-boswellic acid were
      combined and evaporated and the residue was subjected to repeated
      crystallization from ethyl/hexane mixtures to obtain pure
      11-keto-[beta]-boswellic acid (45 g, 95-100%. purity).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] 1e). In a further variation of the process mentioned in
      example 1a, the addition of acetic anhydride was eliminated.
      Instead the peracetylated mixture was diluted with 20 L of acetic
      acid and treated with CrO3 (6.4 kg) in 100 L of acetic acid. The
      reaction mixture was quenched with excess water after 24 h, and
      processed as described in example 1a,<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION : </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Boswellia serrata is a large, branching, deciduous tree,
      which grows abundantly in the dry, hilly parts of India. The gum
      resin exudate of this tree, known in the vernacular as"Salai
      guggal", has been used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine for the
      management of arthritis, respiratory diseases, and liver
      disorders.<br>
      <br>
      The major use of Boswellia serrata in modern medicine is as an
      anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory pharmacological agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The active principles found in the gum resin, specifically
      a combination of boswellic acids, have emerged as effective
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAID's) with broad
      biological activities and also a low ulcerogenic index. Compared
      experimentally with the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone,
      boswellic acids did not produce injury to the gastrointestinal
      mucosa. The most popular NSAID, aspirin, although much better
      tolerated than its parent compound salicylates, still has serious
      side effects, e. g. gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding which
      limit its long-term use. In addition, aspirin is contraindicated
      in patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria (in general
      allergic reactions), and should be administered with caution in
      children and teenagers due to the risk of Reye syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      [00005] One way in which to explain how boswellic acids function
      as NSAIDs in the treatment of inflammatory conditions is to
      compare these natural compounds to aspirin without the typical
      gastrointestinal irritation. Similar to aspirin, boswellic acids
      inhibit the pathway leading from arachidonic acid (a derivative of
      our body's phospholipids) to its metabolic derivatives called
      leukotrienes and prostaglandins.<br>
      <br>
      An excess of leukotrienes and prostaglandins may be responsible,
      directly or indirectly, for the classic signs of inflammation ;
      redness (due to dilated vessels), swelling (due to the blood
      vessels leaking out), pain (due to activation of the pain
      receptors) and increased heat over the affected part of the body.
      The specific biochemical mechanism of boswellic acids differs from
      that of aspirin, however both compounds result in the diminishment
      of the mediators of inflammation, leukotrienes or prostaglandins,
      and the inflammation is subdued.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Studies designed to determine the anti-inflammatory
      mechanism of boswellic acids indicate that their primary mode of
      action involves the inhibition of 5lipoxygenase, the key enzyme
      responsible in the formation of leukotrienes.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, boswellic acids do not appear to impair the
      peroxidation of arachidonic acid by iron and ascorbate. These
      results suggest that boswellic acids are safe, specific, non-redox
      inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis that operate through a well
      defined mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] One of the most interesting properties of boswellic acids
      is their anticomplementary activity. In in vitro experiments
      boswellic acids prevented a wellknown
      inflammatory"chain-reaction"involving several protein compounds
      collectively known as"complement". This is due to the inhibition
      of an enzyme that activates one of the components of complement,
      C3 convertase. The domino effect of the complement in the course
      of rheumatoid arthritis (or a similar chronic inflammatory
      process) leads to a subsequent elevation of the enzymes (e. g.
      cathepsins, glucuronidase and human leukocyte elastase (HLE))
      causing excessive catabolism (wasting) of the joint-forming
      glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans.<br>
      <br>
      This tissue destructive process leads to continuously worsening
      joint disfigurement, pain, and limited mobility. As a consequence
      of complement-mediated tissue destruction, there is an increased
      release of markers (metabolites) of the connective tissue, e. g.
      hydroxyproline, hexosamine and uronic acid. Boswellic acids have
      been found to decrease the levels of tissue destructive enzymes
      and also of the levels of urinary hydroxyproline, hexosamine and
      uronic acid in the acute and chronic phases of experimental
      arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] There are four major b-boswellic acids involved in the
      inhibition of 5lipoxygenase and related anti-inflammatory events.
      These are: b-Boswellic Acid (BBA), Acetyl-b-Boswellic Acid (ABBA),
      11-keto-b-Boswellic Acid (KBBA), Acetyl-11- keto-b-Boswellic
      (AKBBA), listed here in the order of increasing anti-inflammatory
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Boswellic acids have been found to be effective in
      alleviation of numerous inflammatory conditions, including,
      rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A standardized extract of boswellic acids (200 mg tid) was
      evaluated in a four week double blind, cross-over trial in 30
      patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The mean arthritic
      score (sum of symptoms) and the biochemical index of inflammation
      in the group receiving boswellic acids came down significantly
      after the treatment. However, when the placebo was substituted
      (crossover), the subjective and objective indices of arthritis
      rose again. (See Majeed, M, Badmaev, V, Gopinathan, S, Rajendran,
      R, Norton, T. Boswellin The Anti-inflammatory Phytonutrient.
      Nutriscience Publishers, Inc. Piscataway, N. J. 1996. pp. 78.)
      [0011] In another 20 patient, double blind, crossover study a
      boswellia gum resin extract (200 mg tid) combined in an
      herbomineral formula was evaluated in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis and separately in osteoarthritis. Active and placebo
      treatments were given for a period of three months. After a
      washout period of two weeks, the regimens were crossed-over. The
      three month active therapy resulted in a significant decrease in
      severity of pain, morning stiffness, improved joint mobility
      score, grip strength score and the overall disability score
      compared to the placebo group. The biochemical index of
      inflammation was also significantly improved due to the treatment.

      Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Cross-Over Study. Ind J
      Pharmacol. 1992 ; 24: 98-101.) [0012] Ulcerative colitis is an
      example of a chronic inflammatory process in the bowel, which may
      be caused and/or aggravated by excessive leukotriene production.<br>
      <br>
      Effects of Boswellia serrata gum resin (350 mg thrice daily for 6
      weeks) vs. the NSAID sulfasalazine was studied in patients with
      ulcerative colitis. The tested parameters, including stool
      properties, istolopathology of rectal biopsies, and blood
      biochemistry improved after treatment with the gum resin. As a
      result of the treatment, 82% of patients went into remission, as
      compared to a 75% remission rate obtained with sulfasalazine. (See
      Gupta, 1, Parihar, A, Malhotra, P, Singh, GB, Ludtke, R, Safayhi,
      H, Ammon, HP. Effects of Boswellia serrata gum resin in patients
      with ulcerative colitis. Eur J Med Res. 1997 Jan; 2 (1) : 37-43.)
      [0013] Boswellic acids were also tested in the management of
      asthma, since a new generation of anti-asthmatic drugs is based on
      the premise of being leukotriene inhibitors. In a double blind,
      placebo-controlled study 40 patients with a several years'history
      of bronchial asthma were treated with 300 mg tid of boswellia gum
      resin for a period of six weeks. Seventy percent of the patients
      responded to the treatment as evidenced by a reduction in dyspnea,
      ronchi, and number of attacks, improvement in lung tests and blood
      biochemistry. Only 27% of the patients receiving placebo showed
      clinical improvement. (See Gupta, 1, Gupta, V, Parihar, A, Gupta,
      S, Ludtke, R, Safayhi, H, Ammon, HP. Effects Of Boswellia Serrata
      Gum Resin In Patients With Bronchial Asthma: Results Of A
      Double-Blind, Placebo<br>
      Controlled, 6-Week Clinical Study. Eur J Med Res. 1998; 3:
      511-514.) [0014] Finally, boswellic acids also have use in the
      veterinary field. Several veterinarians found success using
      boswellic acids in the treatment of chronic inflammatory
      conditions in horses such as stifle problems, sore backs, bowed
      tendons and bone spurs. In addition, a preliminary study of
      boswellic acids in aging pet dogs and cats showed beneficial
      effects in alleviating arthritic conditions. (See Majeed, M,

      25% boswellic acids) and Boswellin Forte (standardized for 40%
      boswellic acids).<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the minimum amount of each boswellic acid that
      must be present in these grades is:<br>
      Boswellin Forte Boswellin BBA min. 11.0% 6.0% ABBA min. 8.0% 4.0%
      KBBA min. 7.0% 3.0% AKBBA min. 4.0% 1.5% [0016] Please note that,
      of course, every acid may not be present in its minimum amount as
      the required total percentages of boswellic acids (40% and 25%)
      would not be met if this occurred.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Such non-water soluble mixtures of BBA, ABBA, KBBA, and
      AKBBA boswellic acids can be used as a pharmaceutical. Since the
      ancient times, frankincense has been used in the preparation of
      cosmetics and perfumes, and also as a fixative in perfumes, soaps,
      creams, lotions and detergents. Frankincense is a common name for
      Boswellia gum resin, and Boswellia gum resin is a raw source from
      which boswellic acids are extracted. The stabilizing effect of
      frankincense in cosmetic preparations is directly related to the
      biological properties of boswellic acids. The anti-inflammatory
      properties of boswellic acids can also yield an interesting
      applications for topical and cosmetic use of the extract of
      Boswellia serrata. Boswellia cream for the management of
      inflammatory conditions has been available for several years in
      the US market. Its therapeutic composition includes, roughly 5 wt.
      % boswellic acids, 0.025 wt. % capsaicin, an extract of Capsicum
      annum fruits, and 10 wt. % methyl salicylate.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] However, a problem associated with these formulations is
      that they are not soluble in water. Therefore, there is a great
      need in the field for water soluble boswellic acid mixtures and
      salts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION : </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] The new water-soluble composition can be formed through a
      method comprising the steps of: (a) dissolving mixtures of
      boswellic acids in a water and alcohol solution to form a mixture;
      (b) adding one or more alkali salts to the mixture to form a salt
      solution; (c) filtering the solution to separate un-reacted alkali
      salt from a filtrate; and (d) recovering the soluble boswellic
      acid mixture from the filtrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Additionally, the new composition can be formed by using
      super critical carbon dioxide. The new composition can be used to
      alleviate numerous inflammatory conditions, including, but not
      limited to, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, colon cancer,
      prostate cancer and breast cancer, and a broad range of
      neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and
      Parkinson's disease. It can also be used in the prevention and
      treatment of cardiovascular conditions such as stroke, coronary
      artery disease or thrombophlebitis. The composition can be
      administered parenterally, orally, or topically.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DISCLOSURE : </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] As stated above, the composition can be formed by (a)
      dissolving mixtures of boswellic acids in a water and alcohol
      solution to form a mixture, (b) adding one or more alkali salts to
      the mixture to form a salt solution, (c) filtering the salt
      solution to separate un-reacted alkali salt from a filtrate, and
      (d) recovering the soluble boswellic acid mixture from the
      filtrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Preferably, though, the method involves (a) dissolving
      boswellin forte in a water and 5% methanol solution to form a
      mixture, (b) adding one or more potassium salts to the mixture to
      form a salt solution and then stirring the salt solution at room
      temperature, (c) filtering the solution with a nutsche filter to
      separate un-reacted potassium salts from a filtrate, (d)
      recovering the soluble boswellic acid mixture from the filtrate,
      (e) drying the filtrate with a vacuum drier at a temperature of no
      more than 50 C, and (f) powdering the filtrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] More preferably, the filtrate can be dried through
      concentrating the filtrate free of the solvent to obtain a solid,
      wherein this step also further comprises dissolving the obtained
      solid in water to obtain a secondary mixture, charcoalizing the
      secondary mixture, filtering the charcoalized secondary mixture
      and spray-drying the resulting product.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Additionally, it is also possible to use the super critical
      carbon dioxide method of obtaining the boswellic acid mixture.
      Such a process would comprise the steps of (a) dissolving a
      mixture of boswellic acids, preferably boswellin forte, in a water
      and alcohol solution to form a mixture, (b) adding one or more
      alkali salts to the mixture to form a salt solution, (c) treating
      the salt solution with supercritical carbon dioxide, (d) allowing
      the supercritical carbon dioxide to evaporate to leave an
      oleoresin, (e) passing an alcohol solution of the oleoresin
      through a column packed with an anion exchange resin, and (f)
      collecting the soluble boswellic acid mixture from the eluent.
      Furthermore, it is preferred that the treatment of the salt
      solution take place for at least 10 hours and that the alcohol
      solution be 5% methanol and 95% water. Suitable resins include
      Amberjet 4200 (cl), Amberlite IRA 410, Amberlite IRA 900, Dowex
      1x2-100, Dowex 22cl, Dowex Marathon A2, Dowex MSA 1, Dowex 550 A,
      all of which are Rohm-Haas or Dow products. The oleoresin is
      preferably passed through the resin at a rate of 20-50 L per hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The processes described above produce a water soluble
      composition, preferably comprising at least 12.5% by weight of the
      alkali salt of BBA, at least 9.57% by weight of the alkali salt of
      ABBA, at least 8.15% by weight of the alkali salt of KBBA, and at
      least 3.72% by weight of the alkali salt of AKBBA, the remainder
      of the water soluble composition being organic acids or matter,
      and the alkali salts thereof. This composition of boswellic acids
      is suitable for the treatment of many inflammatory conditions
      including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, colon cancer,
      prostate cancer and breast cancer, and a broad range of
      neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and
      Parkinson's disease. It can also be used in the prevention and
      treatment of cardiovascular conditions such as stroke, coronary
      artery disease or thrombophlebitis.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The composition may be administered to the subject orally,
      parenterally, or topically. For preparing pharmaceutical
      compositions containing compounds of the invention, inert,
      pharmaceutical acceptable carriers are used. The pharmaceutical
      carrier can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations
      include, for example, powders, tablets, dispersible granules,
      capsules, creams, and cachets.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A solid carrier can be one or more substances which can
      also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants,
      suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it
      can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is
      generally a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the
      finely divided active component. In tablets, the active compound
      is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties
      in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Powders and tablets preferably contain between about 5% to
      about 70% by weight of the active ingredient. Suitable carriers
      include, for example, magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate,
      talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl
      cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax,
      cocoa butter and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions can
      include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating
      material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active
      component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a
      carrier, which is thus in association with it. In a similar
      manner, cachets are also included. Tablets, powders, cachets, and
      capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral
      administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Liquid pharmaceutical compositions include, for example,
      solutions suitable for oral or parenteral administration, or
      suspensions, and emulsions suitable for oral administration.
      Sterile water solutions of the active component or sterile
      solutions of the active component in solvents comprising water,
      ethanol, or propylene glycol are examples of liquid compositions
      suitable for parenteral administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Sterile solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active
      component in the desired solvent system, and then passing the
      resulting solution through a membrane filter to sterilize it or,
      alternatively, by dissolving the sterile compound in a previously
      sterilized solvent under sterile conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared
      by dissolving the active compound in water or other appropriate
      solvents and adding suitable flavorants, coloring agents,
      stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions
      for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active
      component in water together with a viscous material such as
      natural or synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium
      carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the
      pharmaceutical formulation art. Preferably, the pharmaceutical
      composition is in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition
      is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of
      the boswellic acid mixtures. The unit dosage form can be
      a-packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities
      of the preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and
      powders in vials or ampules. The unit dosage form can also be a
      capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate
      number of any of these packaged forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The specific dosages employed, however, can be varied
      depending upon the requirements of the patient, and the severity
      of the condition being treated. The preferred dosage of the alkali
      boswellic acid salts given is 50-800 mg per day. More preferably,
      the dosage is 100-600 mg per day. Even more preferred is a dosage
      of 150-300 mg per day. Most preferred is a dosage of about 200 mg
      per day, which is preferably administered by doses of 200 mg of
      the boswellic acid salt composition 3 times a day. The
      determination of optimum dosages for a particular situation is
      within the skill of the art.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An initial batch of 1 kg Potassium Boswellin was prepared using
      40% Boswellin Forte material (see Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      Potassium Boswellin and Boswellin 40% were then orally
      administered to two human volunteers who had spent the previous 16
      hours fasting. 1 gram of Potassium Boswellin was given to
      Individual A and 1 gram of Boswellin 40% was given to Individual
      B. Both the Potassium Boswellin and the Boswellin 40% were
      suspended in 35 mi of milk and given to the subjects to consume. 5
      ml of blood was withdrawn from the volunteers at intervals of
      5,10,20,40,80, and 160 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The blood samples were collected into sterile centrifuge tubes and
      left for 120 minutes to retract the clot. The samples were then
      centrifuged to separate the serum. The serum was transferred to
      sterile 2 mi vials and stored at 0 C-4 C overnight.<br>
      <br>
      The serum samples were then brought to room temperature. 1 ml of
      the serum was placed into a 10 ml stoppered volumetric flask and 1
      ml of 3 N HCI was added to it. This mixture was then sonicated for
      20 minutes to free the boswellic acid. The volume of the mixture
      was then brought to 10 ml with methanol and the resulting solution
      was sonicated for 10 minutes to extract the boswellic acids and to
      precipitate the serum proteins. This prepared sample was then
      transferred into capped centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4,000
      rpm for 10 minutes. The serum proteins were precipitated as
      sediment and the clear supernatant was filtered through No. 1
      filter paper.<br>
      <br>
      The clear supernatants were then subjected to a HPLC assay, the
      results of which are shown in Figures 2-5. As can be plainly seen,
      the serum with Potassium Boswellin shows that a greater amount of
      boswellic acids have been absorbed by the subject's bloodstream,
      thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the present invention.<br>

      The invention relates to a novel and improved nanoparticulate form
      of a frankincense gum extract, containing, inter alia, Boswellic
      acids and/or their derivatives. The nanoparticles have
      advantageous properties for use in the treatment of inflammatory
      diseases. Surprisingly, these advantages are obtained both in
      topical application and oral administration. When used in topical
      formulations, the nanoparticles are better absorbed by the skin
      than are known, tacky extracts, and they are thus suitable for the
      treatment, for example, of neurodermatitis and/or actinic
      keratosis and/or basal cell carcinoma and/or epithlioma and/or
      squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. For example, in soft gel
      capsules that dissolve in the small intestine, the nanoparticles
      have much improved bioavailability, which also considerably
      improves oral administration for treatment of inflammatory
      conditions. Finally, the nanoparticles can also be used for
      coating stents and implants.<br>

      [0003] The invention relates to a new and improved nanoparticulate
      form of a Olibanumextraktes (incense extract) containing, among
      other boswellic acids and / or derivatives thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The dissolved Olibanumextrakt embedded in spherical particles
      having a three-dimensional size in the nanometer (nm) range.<br>
      <br>
      The so-called nanoparticles have advantageous properties in terms
      of a use for treating inflammatory diseases.<br>
      Surprisingly these advantages are obtained both for a topical, an
      oral administration as well as a surface coating of implants.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoparticles are absorbed better when used in topical
      formulations of the skin known as sticky extracts and thus
      suitable for the treatment of, for example, atopic dermatitis and
      / or actinic keratosis and / or basal cell carcinoma and / or
      squamous and / or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in enteric softgels show the olibanum nanoparticles
      significantly improved bioavailability, which also improves oral
      use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions significantly.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, Olibanum nanoparticles can also be used for coating of
      implants (vessel joint, bone, tooth) and surgical sutures.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] state of the art early in oriental folk medicine is the use
      of incense, primarily in India and in the Near East, for the
      treatment of various diseases, especially inflammation and
      rheumatic joint diseases known.<br>
      Even in recent times several medical applications have been found
      for incense or Olibanumextrakte and especially for boswellic acids
      and their derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      Inflammatory responses are measures of the organism, which serve
      to remove the damaging tissue damages by causing foreign bodies or
      the damaged part of the tissue repair and replace tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, inflammation is a physiological process.<br>
      <br>
      However, there are a number of situations in which functions of
      organs are disturbed by inflammatory processes, especially when
      they are shooting or chronic.<br>
      <br>
      Inflammation is triggered by the release of so-called biochemical
      mediators of inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      There are two types of different inflammatory mediators that are
      involved in the formation and maintaining inflammatory
      prostaglandins and leukotrienes.<br>
      <br>
      The current therapy of inflammation occurs with drugs that are
      predominantly in a position called the arachidonic acid cascade,
      namely to block the part of the leads to the formation of
      Prostaglandiene.<br>
      <br>
      The drugs used are among the steroidal and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs is associated with
      significant side effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The anti-inflammatory effect of boswellic acids has been
      repeatedly published (Safayhi, H., et.<br>
      AI, Planta Medica 63, 487-493, 1997. J. Pharmacol. And Exp Ther,
      261, 1143-46, 1992). Sashwati et al investigated by screening the
      human genome, the genetic basis of the anti-inflammatory effect of
      Boswellia in microvascular endothelial cells and found an
      inhibition of 5 -lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of
      leukotrienes. The research revealed that
      3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid is the most potent as
      5-lipoxygenase inhibitor among the boswellic acids.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the boswellic acids prevented the TNF-alpha-induced
      expression of metalloproteinases and of mediators of apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      It was also the expression of&nbsp; VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 suppresses
      Olibanumextrakte.<br>
      <br>
      This research showed that Olibanumextrakt by influencing the
      mechanisms of inflammation Signalmecha anti-inflammatory effect
      (Sashwati, R., et al, DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY:. VoI 24, Number 4,
      2005).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] EP 552 657 A1 discloses that pure boswellic acid, the
      physiologically compatible salts borrowed, derivatives thereof and
      salts of derivatives or a herbal preparation containing boswellic
      acid can fight inflammation, caused by increased leukotriene
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      It is suggested in the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases,
      epidermal lesions, allergic and chronic asthma, Endoxinschock,
      inflammatory bowel disease and chronic hepatitis with these
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] WO 90/01937 reports that a-and ss-Boswelliaacetat
      Boswelliaacetat and its analogs inhibit topoisomerase I and
      topoisomerase II.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, this document proposes to use the compounds for the
      treatment of various cancers.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] WO 97/07796 uses boswellic acid, a physiologically
      acceptable salt, derivative, a salt of said derivative or a
      boswellic acid-containing herbal preparation for the prophylaxis
      and / or the control of diseases that are caused by increased
      Leukozytenelastaseoder Piasminaktivität.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, this document proposes to use the compounds in the
      treatment of diseases such as emphysema, acute respiratory
      distress syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cystic
      fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid
      arthritis, and also to inhibit the growth and metastasis of many
      cancers.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] WO 02/15916 discloses Dihydroboswelliasäuren,
      physiologically acceptable salts thereof, and hydrogenated
      extracts of boswellia.<br>
      <br>
      It is proposed to use these compounds for prophylactic and / or
      therapeutic treatment of adverse physical and psychological
      conditions, especially of somatic, psychosomatic and mental
      disorders such as inflammatory processes, which are caused by
      increased leukotriene formation, Leukozytenelastaseoder
      Piasminaktivität.<br>
      The above diseases are, for example inflammatory joint diseases,
      epidermal lesions, allergic and chronic asthma, endotoxin,
      inflammatory bowel disease, chronic hepatitis, pulmonary
      emphysema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock lung, cystic
      fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid
      arthritis as well as specific tumors and tumor metastases.<br>

      [0015] DE 101 21 252 A1 describes the treatment of acne, a
      hormone-induced inflammatory skin disease, the use of lipoxygenase
      inhibitors alone or in combination with other lipoxygenase
      inhibitors or with other anti-acne agents in a suitable
      pharmaceutical composition, in particular by oral and / or
      locally-applied topically.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In the publication U.S. 2004/0166178 A1 discloses the use
      of 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid is described in a formulation
      for topical application for relaxation of the skin and for the
      treatment of facial wrinkles.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In summary it can be said that incense and Olibanumextrakte
      is known as a traditional natural remedies or medicines to treat
      various physical and mental conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the versatility of the applicability of the good effect
      coupled with reduced side effects, there is a great need to
      provide Olibanumextrakte in an improved form, and this improved
      formulation for as many applications, such as topical and oral
      administration as well as for coating implants and should be
      suitable for surgical sutures.<br>

      constitutionalis, endogenous eczema Besnier-prurigo) is a chronic
      or chronically relapsing, in their morphological aspect and
      overall process quite different types of inflammatory skin disease
      which is accompanied by severe itching.<br>
      <br>
      The eczema is hereditary and often occurs together with other
      atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis
      and allergic bronchial asthma on.<br>
      <br>
      Biochemically is neurodermatitis a fault in the humoral and
      cellular immunity, the infection is associated with a high
      activity of the skin.<br>
      <br>
      The current treatment of these inflammatory skin disorder is often
      performed by means of the external application of glucocorticoids
      in the form of ointments or creams.<br>
      <br>
      This inflammatory activity is indeed reduced, but the treatment is
      associated with significant side effects with cortisone.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The incidence of "light skin cancer," meaning Kanzerosen as
      actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas
      and squamous fall, takes explosively in the temperate latitudes.<br>
      <br>
      The "light skin cancer" is ten times more common than melanoma,
      the skin cancer known as black. Every seven years, double the
      number of cases. One of the causes is sun exposure and skin damage
      caused by UV radiation and the frequent use of tanning beds.<br>
      <br>
      The actinic keratoses are now no longer classified as a
      precancerous condition, but as an early cancer.<br>
      Approximately every second German has over 60 years due to many
      years of UV light exposure to actinic keratoses.<br>
      <br>
      Most actinic keratoses persist as long Carinoma in situ, whereas
      20% show spontaneous remission or develop into invasive carcinomas
      spinozelläre.<br>
      <br>
      There are now following therapeutic options: 1 Surgical removal
      (eg As excision, curettage, cryosurgery), with mostly 100%
      remissions are obtained. However, there remain scars and
      surrounding skin areas that were indeed exposed to the same UV
      exposure, remain untreated.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;2 Chemotherapies (eg As 5-fluorouracil or podophyllin) reach
      up to 85% remissions and can be applied areally.<br>
      However, they must be carried out over weeks, are painful and can
      leave scars and pigmentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] 3 Photodynamic Therapy: After photosensitization by 5 -
      aminolevulinic acid cream light to destroy the tumor cells.
      Remissions and good cosmetic results can be achieved. For this,
      the procedure is painful phototoxic reactions are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] 4 Immunomodulators: For example, with imiquimod or
      diclofenac as a cream or gel remissions in up to 80% of cases can
      be achieved and the actinic keratoses can be removed without
      leaving any scars. The treatment is repeated, but it takes at
      least 12 weeks and requires a high level of patient compliance.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In the above-mentioned skin diseases is a high inflammatory
      activity with activation of inflammatory mediators, such as
      prostaglandins and the 5-lipoxygenase. In the skin lesions can be
      as in the basal cell carcinoma, squamous and squamous skin cells
      degenerate prove. By antiphlogistic drugs that interfere with the
      prostaglandin, such as diclofenac, remission can be achieved, but
      these drugs are known side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Boswellic acids that occur from Olibanumharz in the extract have
      anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and cytostatic effects.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-inflammatory action based on inhibition of
      5-lipoxygenase, in an essential enzyme for the synthesis of
      leukotrienes (see, for B. Safayhi et al., Mol Pharm 47, 1212-1216,
      1995. Sailer et al, Arch Pharm 329, 54-56, 1996) and the
      inhibition of leukocyte elastase, as described in EP 854 709th<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, boswellic acids have a cytostatic effect.<br>
      <br>
      It is reported more recently, of chemopreventive and therapeutic
      effects of acetyl-keto-boswellic acids in the treatment of various
      cancers.<br>
      <br>
      This seems to be the inhibition of topoisomerase-1, alpha
      TopoisomeraseIl and induction of apoptosis through activation of
      caspase-3 and -8 play a key role by boswellic acids (Jian-Jun Liu,
      et. AI., Intern. J. of Molecular Medicine 10:. 501-505, 2002, Shao
      et al, Planta Medica 64, 328-331, 1998). These effects appear to
      be suitable as boswellic acids for treatment of tumors, as
      described in EP 871 437<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Treatment of inflammatory and malignant skin diseases
      Olibanumextrakten and / or boswellic acids and derivatives thereof
      is generally known in the prior art. However, arises with the
      topical use of the extracts, the problem that they are typically
      sticky and thus have the property not to be absorbed by the skin
      and therefore can not operate in the deeper skin layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] There is therefore a need, extracts of frankincense in a
      form more available for topical applications to provide that
      optimally penetrate into the skin to the skin in order to be
      pharmacologically active either topically or systemically.<br>
      <br>
      Vascular disease<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Atherosclerosis is the cause of heart attacks, strokes and
      peripheral vascular occlusive disease of the extremities and is a
      chronic inflammatory fibroproliferative disease of the arterial
      wall, which is associated with an impaired immune response.<br>
      Inflammatory processes, the inner wall of arteries, the intima,
      disturbed in their integrity and particularly loaded vessel
      sections, for example on vessel bifurcations occur injuries and
      lacerations of the intima.<br>
      Inflammatory cells in the lesions themselves are deposited as
      monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and
      neutrophils.<br>
      Mast cells are transformed by taking up oxidized low-density
      lipoproteins (LDL) in foam cells and to form the "lipid core" of
      the so-called plaques, inflammatory ulcers in the vessel wall.<br>
      Reduce by chronic inflammation with activation of
      metalloproteinases, enzymes, connective tissue and collagen, the
      connective tissue sheath layer of the plaques is injured and the
      lipid-containing core of the plaques come in contact with the
      coagulation system of the blood, it forms very quickly
      Gerinnungspfropf which closes the vessel .<br>
      This process occurs in a coronary artery that supplied by the
      vascular portion of the heart muscle dies from lack of oxygen. A
      heart attack is the result. Atherosclerotic processes in the brain
      that trigger strokes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The inflammation of the vessel wall are activated by
      inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes
      released. Leukotrienes are formed via the 5-lipoxygenase cascade
      of inflammation. It has been shown that 5-lipoxygenase expressed
      in increasing concentrations at various stages of atherosclerosis
      in the arterial wall (Spanbroek, R.; PNAS, Vol 100, No. 3,
      1238-1243, 2003). The authors proposed a new model of
      atherosclerosis in which mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase
      inflammatory activity in the vessel wall is the cause of the
      progression of atherosclerotic lesions.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Inflammatory markers in the blood of patients with
      atherosclerosis have elevated levels of C-reactive protein,
      interleukin 116, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a
      reduced antioxidant capacity, increased lipid peroxidation and
      increased homocysteine ??concentrations.<br>
      In the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease with
      statins, that lipid-lowering drugs, in addition to a reduction of
      the anti-inflammatory effects LDLCholesterinspiegels a reduction
      was observed with the C-reactive protein concentration.<br>
      This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in the risk
      of sudden cardiac death and stroke and the significant decrease in
      the lipid core forming lipoproteins (LDL) and inflammatory
      activity has been attributed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The treatment of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease is
      classically with medications such as statins, beta-blockers, ACE
      inhibitors, and acetylsalicylic acid, which all require
      considerable side effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Olibanumextrakte point, as explained in detail above,
      anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects on cytostatic,
      which is also known from the prior art.<br>
      These effects make the extracts useful in the treatment of
      inflammatory processes and vascular proliferative diseases,
      arteriosclerosis, and side effects of conventional drugs can be
      avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] However, there is a need, extracts of frankincense in a
      more bioavailable form for oral administration to provide.
      implants<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As an example, stents: percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA) of blood vessels, especially the coronary artery
      angioplasty (PTCA) is a very common way to eliminate strictures or
      stenoses, which obstruct the blood supply of human organs.<br>
      <br>
      Endovascular stents are used as a scaffold in order to prevent a
      sudden arterial occlusion in the angioplasty.<br>
      Stents may also reduce the restenosis rates as compared with a
      conventional balloon angioplasty.<br>
      <br>
      Restenosis after stent implantation, however, provide at rates
      20-30% remains a Problern in coronary arteries dar.<br>
      Restenosis is the result of massive blood vessel damage with
      induction of inflammation and endothelial cell proliferation
      stimuli for the use of a stent.<br>
      <br>
      Rates of restenosis following stent implantation are also from the
      stent design and material dependent.<br>
      From WO 90/13332 and WO 91/12779 stent has become known, which are
      coated with anti-inflammatory drugs gerinnungsund to reduce
      restenosis rates.<br>
      <br>
      The erfolgversprechensten drugs that may reduce restenosis rates
      effective agents include rapamycin (sirolimus (R)) and paclitacel
      (Taxol (R)).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic which has both
      anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties.<br>
      It prevents smooth muscle cell proliferation and reduces the
      inflammatory response induced by stent implantation by inhibition
      of proinflammatory cytokines (Suzuki et al., Circulation 104 (10),
      1188-1193, 2001).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] One of the disadvantages of the currently discussed eluting
      stents is the delayed epithelialization of the stent inner
      surface, so that the antithrombotic therapy to prevent must be
      in-stent thrombosis significantly prolonged time. There is thus a
      need to provide an alternative means which is suitable to coat
      stents.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The object of the invention is therefore to provide
      Olibanumextrakt in a form which can be used in pharmaceutical and
      / or cosmetic and / or for the coating of the implant surface, and
      thereby improves the corresponding means.<br>
      <br>
      This improvement should be guaranteed for different application
      forms such as topical and oral administration.<br>
      In the area of ??topical application is to be achieved in that the
      or can be absorbed by the skin, the active compounds of the
      Olibanumextrakts better.<br>
      <br>
      In the oral administration of Olibanumextrakt the active
      ingredient to be more bioavailable.<br>
      <br>
      In the application for the coating of surfaces of implant
      treatment of vascular disease is to be provided for example by
      means of a stent in the form Olibanumextrakt within which makes
      the coating of the stent with the active compound or compounds of
      Olibanumextrakt possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] These objects are achieved by the subject matter of the
      claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Surprisingly it was found that Olibanumextrakte in
      nanoparticulate form are perfectly suitable, on the one hand in
      formulations for topical administration and the other in
      formulations for oral administration significantly improve their
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      When applied topically, the active ingredient (or active
      ingredients) is much better absorbed by the skin than is the case
      with the use of conventional extracts.<br>
      <br>
      For oral administration, preferably in enteric soft gel capsules,
      the bioavailability of the active substance (or substances) is
      considerably improved.<br>
      <br>
      It was also found that Olibanumextrakte in nanoparticulate form
      are an excellent way to coat implants such as stents or other
      (port system, joint prostheses, Herzschrittmaeher, dental pins,
      screws, plates, Kirschner wires).<br>
      <br>
      Also has been found out that surgical sutures (eg As
      polyethylene), and indwelling indwelling, vascular catheters can
      be coated with Olibanumextrakt-Nanopartikenl.<br>
      <br>
      The devices mentioned can cause foreign body reactions in the
      human body, which may be associated with inflammation and even
      with Granulombildungen.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, it has been found that the coating of the device
      with OlibanumNanopartikeln prevent foreign body reaction or can be
      counteracted.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, it has proved advantageous to add as additive to
      Olibanumextrakt storage solutions for biological materials in
      nanoparticulate form.<br>
      <br>
      These can be used in transport solutions for organs, as used for
      example in organ transplantation.<br>
      [0038] Olibanumextrakt can be obtained by, for example, ethanol,
      methanol, ether or chloroform extraction extraction of resin of
      olibanum. Preferably, such extracts are lipophilic.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the
      Olibanumextrakt with acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid is enriched ss.<br>

      acid ss-containing plant extracts.<br>
      Also suitable are hydrogenation products of other ingredients of
      the incense, such as from the other Tirucallensäure or
      triterpenoid compounds, salts or derivatives thereof as well as
      plant extracts containing these compounds.<br>
      According to the invention are suitable as an additive continue

      Also suitable are hydrogenation of ss-boswellic acid,
      Boswelliasäureformiat ss, ss-boswellic acid, acetyl-ss-boswellic
      acid, but also of the boswellic acids and derivatives of boswellic
      acids, which are described in DE-A 42 01 903, of which reference
      is made to the will.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] boswellic acids, in particular acetyl-11-keto-boswellic ss
      can, in a known manner to be obtained from boswellic
      acid-containing plants.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable Boswelliaarten are: Boswellia serrata, Boswellia carteri,

      The compounds useful according to the invention can be obtained by
      hydrogenation, preferably by catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogenation of these compounds is carried out in a manner
      known in the art, preferably so that the backbone of the compound
      is selectively hydrogenated.<br>
      <br>
      Such a method is described for example in WO 02 / 15916th<br>
      <br>
      [0044] For the preparation of the inventive pharmaceutical
      composition may further contain a hydrated plant extract is from
      incense, for example, ethanol, methanol, chloroform extraction,
      ether extraction, or obtained may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The Olibanumextrakte used in the invention include, in

      content enriched.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In accordance with the invention physiologically acceptable
      salts, especially the sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium and
      calcium salts of the above compounds are understood.<br>
      <br>
      Derivatives such as in particular Ci-C6 - alkyl esters of
      Dihydroboswelliasäure understood, in which the carboxyl group of
      the Dihydroboswelliasäure was esterified with a corresponding
      alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      Such Dihydroboswelliasäurealkylester are for example the methyl
      ester, ethyl ester, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl
      esters and the tertButylester Dihydroboswelliasäuren.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Herbal preparations that can be used for the preparation of the
      novel Olibanumextrakte are commercially available, for example
      from the company PL-Thomas, New Jersey under the name 5-Loxin
      (TM).<br>
      This is a standardized Olibanumextrakt of Boswellia serrata, at
      least 30% of the acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid contains.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] According to the invention, however, can also
      Olibanumextrakte and their hydrogenation products are used by
      other preparations, in particular according to the invention can
      also hydrogenation synthetically manufactured or natural way
      derived ingredients of incense, especially
      acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and / or 11 -
      beta.-keto-boswellic acid and / or ss-boswellic acid, optionally
      in admixture with a-und/oder yBoswelliasäure and / or several of
      the derivatives according to the invention are preferably used the
      boswellic acid, as described above, to produce the drug.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] According to the invention, the medicament in addition to
      the herein defined, based on incense ingredients or other active
      ingredients, especially other herbal ingredients contained.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] According to the invention is brought into a
      nanoparticulate form with one or more of the optional additives
      described above, the Olibanumextrakt.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the nanoparticles have a size in the range of 30 to
      400 nm, preferably 60 to 200 nm, more preferably from 100 to 200
      nm.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art will vary depending on use of the
      medicine anvisierter known per se and suitably produce
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Since the Olibanumextrakt, especially the hydrogenated
      Olibanumextrakt and especially the hydrogenated boswellic acids
      and their derivatives and salts have a very low toxicity, their
      compatibility is generally good.<br>
      Your dosage can be easily selected by the treating physician
      according to the severity of the condition being treated and other
      factors such as the duration of the disease, possible known
      incompatibilities of the patient's general condition of the
      patient, etc..<br>
      <br>
      The drug according to the invention can be formulated so that it
      is in unit doses one or more times daily, in particular mono-to
      four times a day can be administered.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] For topical application, the inventive nanoparticles can be
      incorporated into dermatocosmetic ointment bases, which can be
      applied several times daily to the affected skin.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive pharmaceutical compositions may be, for example, in
      solid, semisolid, or liquid form.<br>
      Suitable creams, ointments, gels, lotions, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] For oral administration come into consideration tablets,
      granules, capsules, solutions, etc., which include
      pharmaceutically acceptable additives in addition to the invention
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the pharmaceutical compositions may be in a manner
      known in the art as liquid compositions for oral administration.<br>
      <br>
      Preference for oral administration enteric softgels are thin.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The invention is not to be bound by the following
      statement, but probably have the novel nanoparticles of the active
      substance (or substances) in enteric softgels to a significantly
      improved bioavailability, since the nanoparticles probably similar
      transport mechanisms in the intestine as the
      Phosphatidylcholinmatrix triglycerides are absorbed via
      chylomicrons.<br>
      <br>
      Other examples of suitable formulations and methods for their
      preparation can be found in DE-A 44 44 288 and DE-A 44 45 728, to
      the extent fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Finally, the invention nanoparticles of the active
      ingredient (or ingredients) for coating medikamenteneluierenden
      implants, such as stents, are suitable.<br>
      <br>
      By the inhibitory effect on the proliferation of smooth muscle
      cells in the vessel wall and by inhibiting the inflammatory
      processes counteract the novel nanoparticles of in-stent
      restenosis.<br>
      <br>
      According to the international medical literature, it comes with
      the conventional stent within the first six months in 30% of cases
      a stent closure or to an in-stent stenosis.<br>
      <br>
      For nanoparticles coated with the inventive stent is a high
      probability that this closure rate can be significantly reduced.<br>

      [0057] Example 1:<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Use of the nanoparticles according to the invention as a
      topical cream to treat inflammatory skin diseases,<br>
      <br>
      [0059] 1-5% (relative to the ointment base) of the novel
      nanoparticles are applied morning and evening to the affected skin
      and gently massaged.<br>
      <br>
      Inflammation is a visible reduction in pilot studies in actinic
      keratosis, eczema and psoriasis already detectable after one week.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the inflammatory lesions were completely healed after
      a treatment period of 6 weeks at a cohort of 5 patients with
      actinic keratoses in 3 patients.<br>
      <br>
      In one patient the result was confirmed histologically.<br>
      <br>
      In 2 patients, the skin lesions were significantly improved.<br>

      nanoparticles were prepared as described in Example 1 above, is
      applied. In addition, activation was:<br>
      <br>
      [0063] 1 A soft laser, 785 nm, laser shower (from MKW Laser
      System) with 14 x 10 mW power, 5 minutes in direct skin contact

      [0064] 2 With water-filtered infrared-A (from Hydrosun) for 20 min
      at 30 cm distance, two per week, performed once. The infrared
      activation of nanoparticles according to the invention was carried
      out 2 times a week.<br>
      By activation with infrared led to a much faster effect.<br>
      <br>
      The postulated mechanism could be a direct activation of boswellia
      triterpenes by energy absorption and improve the penetration
      properties of the skin by a low-thermal radiation.<br>
