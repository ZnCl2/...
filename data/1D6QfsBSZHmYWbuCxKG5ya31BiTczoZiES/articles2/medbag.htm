                    Decay</font></b><b><br>
                  by Christian Nordqvist</b> <br>
                Editor: Medical News Today</p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A new chewing gum containing good
            bacteria which prevent harmful bacteria from destroying our
            teeth has been developed by scientists working for BASF GmbH
            and OrganoBalance GmbH. There is also a good chance good
            bacteria could be added to deodorants to eliminate BO (body
            odour). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The company says that as well as
            chewing gum to protect teeth, it is looking into developing
            toothpastes and mouthwashes which contain this friendly
            bacteria. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The bacteria is called
            Lactobacillus, and is usually found in yoghurt. The
            scientists discovered a new strain, called L. anti-caries. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans),
            a harmful type of bacteria, sticks to the surface of the
            teeth and converts sugar into acids which eat away at the
            enamel. L. anti-caries makes S. mutans clump together so
            that it cannot stick to your teeth. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">BASF researchers say tests have
            shown their chewing gum managed to reduce S. mutans levels
            in the mouth to one-fiftieth of what they were. The company
            hopes to have the first oral hygiene products containing L.
            anti-caries on the market next year. Stefan Marcinowski,
            Executive Director of Research, BASF, did not say whether
            the products would first appear as chewing gums, toothpastes
            or mouthwashes. <br>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Plants actually use gravity for
            their growth, rather than just overcoming it. Gravity
            provides the driving force for a two-way elevator formed by
            separate liquid columns, where the downward flowing side
            carries a concentrated and therefore heavier form of the
            lighter ascending liquid. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Evaporation does the trick,
            concentrating the mineral content of the sap by getting rid
            of the pure H2O while keeping the minerals. The heavy
            descending liquid and the ascending new sap form a loop
            where water molecules, in what is described as a rubber-band
            effect, are able to lift the ascending column by negative
            pressure at the top. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A first set of observations about
            sleeping in a slightly inclined position (head up, feet
            down, five degrees) rather than in our traditional perfectly
            horizontal beds, seems to confirm that the human organism
            requires gravitational pull to function in an optimal
            manner. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Positive health effects were
            observed for those sleeping in the inclined position. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Start at a six inch incline until
            you are comfortable with the changes, then go for the full 8
            inch incline. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Complete spinal cord injuries
            dating back as much as 18 years can be reversed to some
            degree by simply tilting a bed and altering the posture
            while seated! </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">My discovery is in how gravity
            drives the cerebrospinal fluid, in a simple flow and return
            system, inducing some nerve regeneration, and also appears
            to facilitate effective guidance to regenerating nerves,
            much the same as how gravity induces and guides direction to
            seedlings </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This is achieved by altering
            posture to make use of gravity and can repair a significant
            amount of the damage in complete / incomplete spinal cord
            injuries. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">However, this does not solely
            relate to spinal function and a vast amount of other
            benefits have been reported, namely restored bowel and
            bladder function, increased metabolism, reductions in
            infections, visual improvements and in particular addresses
            the problem of urinary infections by assisting the renal
            function, muscular atrophy, and osteoporosis have responded
            well to this intervention. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A general decrease in pain has
            been noted by some people that have already taken part in
            the pilot study. However, during nerve regeneration /
            redirection, people have reported a temporary increase in
            pain. Spasm and general muscle tension is improved
            significantly also. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">One of the first things you
            should notice is an improvement in body temperature. Instead
            of cold hands and feet, you will find that you have nice
            warm hands and warm feet. Goose bumps occur, finger / toe
            nails and hair grows more profusely. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Toe nails, when they are in poor
            condition, have been reported to shed and a new nail grows
            which is stronger and smoother than the old nails that have
            been lost in two cases. </p>

              <p><b>Cashew Based Skin Cream to Resolve Skin Cancer and
                  Warts</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It was during Rolando de la Cruz'
            work as a barber that he became familiar with various skin
            problems suffered by his clientele: "Many of the people who
            came to me for haircuts suffered fungal infections and other
            skin diseases. Thats when I began thinking about how I
            could help treat their ailments." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">His invention is a skin cream
            called DeBCC, which is used for the treatment of basal cell
            carcinoma (BCC), the most common type of skin cancer. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The cream contains a formulation
            of cashew nut extracts and other Philippine herbs. "By mere
            application of the cream, with no radical and unacceptable
            surgeries or procedures, 14 patients with skin cancer were
            cured in 16 weeks. No recurrences were reported," De la Cruz
            said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">De la Cruz said he discovered the
            health properties of DeBCC through an "accident." "I was a
            young boy then and I was eating cashew seeds when I felt a
            burning sensation. In tears, I ran to my mother, who told me
            in Kapampangan that it is the cashew seeds I had chewed
            that had burnt me," De la Cruz said with a smile as he
            recalled how his mother taught him that cashew nuts produce
            heat. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In high school, De la Cruz said
            he had a classmate who underwent treatment for warts on the
            neck: "My classmate told me he could not stand the pain of
            the wart-removal treatment which involved heat. He said it
            was painful even with anesthesia. It was then that I
            recalled the cashew incident." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">His innovation was to develop a
            cream from cashew nut extracts to treat patients with the
            skin condition. Using the cashew cream, De la Cruz said, a
            patient barely feels pain: "Parang kagat lang ng langgam (it
            is just like an ant bite)." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Besides DeBCC, De la Cruzs magic
            touch was acknowledged for his Amazing Touch product, which
            offers natural, non-surgical removal of warts, moles and
            other skin growths using cashew nut extracts. RCC Amazing
            Touch International Inc. was established in March 1997 as a
            one-stop shop for skin and hair care treatment. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"Proven to be safe and effective
            with no side effects, it is relatively painless, bloodless
            and scar-less, and requires no anesthesia," De la Cruz said
            of his products. <br>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The skin is the largest organ in
            our body. It provides protection against heat, cold, light,
            and infection. It is made up of two major layers, the
            epidermis and the dermis, and various types of cells. The
            epidermis which is the outer layer of the skin is composed
            of three layers of cells â€“ flat, scaly shells on the
            surface called squamous cells, round cells called basal
            cells, and melanocytes, cells that provide the skin its
            color and protect against skin damage. The inner layer of
            the skin, the dermis, contains nerves, blood vessels, and
            sweat glands. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Each year, millions of people all
            over the world are diagnosed with the most common forms of
            skin cancer â€“ basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
            carcinoma, and melanoma. World cancer societies says tens of
            millions of new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed each
            year. Sunlight provides much of what is beneficial and even
            necessary to life and good health, but tanning and burning
            are not among these benefits. Sunburn and ultraviolet (UV)
            light can damage the skin and this damage can lead to skin
            cancer. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Over the past decade, researchers
            have discovered that exposure to ultraviolet radiation is
            the single most important cause of skin cancer, especially
            when the exposure results in sunburn and blistering. Other
            less common causes of skin cancer are repeated exposure to
            x-ray, coal tar, arsenic, and other industrial compounds.
            Fortunately, there are ways to prevent most skin cancers and
            to detect them early when they do arise. When treated early,
            the vast majority of these cancers are curable. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A skin cancer cream known as the
            DeBCC was developed and studied by Philippine General
            Hospital (PGH) doctors in partnership with a famous inventor
            and won the top prize during the 93rd annual convention of
            the Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons
            held in New Orleans, Louisiana, the most prestigious forum
            for the presentation of research and innovations in surgical
            treatment in the world. The Philippine entry, the DeBCC,
            formulated from the extract of cashew nuts, was voted the
            "Best Scientific Exhibit for 2007." The invention had
            previously won gold medals from the Archimedes Inventors
            show in Moscow in 2005 and the International Inventorâ€™s
            Forum in Nuremberg, Germany also in 2005, and the Diamond
            and Overall Inventorâ€™s Awards for 2006 at the British
            Invention show in 2006. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">These honors are testimony to the
            determination of the team of Drs. Eric S.M. Talens, Daniel
            de la Paz, Orlando O. Ocampo, Porfirio P. Tica, Horacio
            Estradato, and inventor Rolando de la Cruz to formulate and
            discover alternative treatments for common ailments that
            offer more cost-effective local options, with the ultimate
            objective of improving healthcare in the Philippines. </p>

              <p><b>Larry O'Hanlon</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Scientists aren't sure how some
            clays kill bacteria. Metals in the clay may be the active
            ingredients. Or the highly charged molecular surfaces of the
            clay minerals may tear up bacterial cells. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Your doctor may one day prescribe
            dirt, if new research into a few potent antibacterial clays
            is successful. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Plenty of clays are already on
            the market, touted as cures for various ailments. But few
            have any clinical data to back them up. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">That began to change five years
            ago when the late French humanitarian worker Line Brunet de
            Courssou reported that a French clay called Agricur was
            effective against the flesh-eating disease Buruli ulcer in
            Africa's Ivory Coast. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Now an interdisciplinary team of
            microbiologists and mineralogists is trying to figure out
            exactly how the clay cures. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"They would mix clay with water
            and make a paste and put it on the horrible wounds," says
            clay mineral researcher Associate Professor Lynda Williams
            of Arizona State University. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">When daily applications of the
            clay caused too much pain and appeared not to help, another
            French clay was used. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"It was the second clay that
            killed [the bacteria], although the clays are
            mineralogically identical," Williams says. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">That's where Williams and
            colleagues such as microbiologist Assistant Professor
            Shelley Haydel were able to begin research supported by the
            US National Institutes of Health into what makes one clay
            toxic to bacteria and the other harmless. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The first results of their work
            will be presented later this month at the meeting of the
            Geological Society of America in Denver. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"We're not just buying this
            healing stuff," says Williams of the popular and unproven
            use of all sorts of clays for questionable medical purposes.
            "We're trying to understand." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A range of clays</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The researchers used several
            different clays, including sterile sand and the French clay
            used in the Ivory Coast, to see how well they killed a broad
            spectrum of bacteria. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Several different kinds of
            well-known, dangerous bacteria - Salmonella typhimurium,
            Streptococcus sp, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas stutzeri
            - were exposed to the clays. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"We found that bacterial cultures
            lost 90-99% of viability within 24 hours of exposure to the
            French Agricur clays," reports US Geological Survey
            researcher David Metge, who collaborated with Williams,
            Haydel and others. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"These results contrasted to only
            10-40% of reduced viability caused by other clays or sterile
            sand." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The trick now, of course, is
            figuring out exactly how the clay is killing the
            microorganisms, says Williams. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">One possibility is that metals in
            the clay are the active ingredients. Or it could be that the
            highly charged molecular surfaces of the clay minerals tear
            up bacterial cells. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Either way, clays would probably
            be a lot harder for bacteria to evolve defences against, as
            is happening with the accidental breeding of 'super bugs by
            the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterial products. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Unlike antibiotics, clay minerals
            almost certainly kill bacteria by a physical not biochemical
            process, says mineralogist Professor Ross Giese of the State
            University of New York in Buffalo, who is not directly
            involved in Williams' project. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Once researchers figure out the
            mechanism behind the killer clays, cheaper treatments for
            Buruli ulcer and other diseases may follow. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The World Health Organization
            (WHO), recently labeled Buruli ulcer an emerging public
            health threat. The disfiguring disease is increasingly
            common among children in central and western Africa. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">If one of the Buruli's rural
            victims is fortunate enough to get medical help, the
            infected tissue is generally cut out, which sometimes means
            amputation. There is no other WHO-approved treatment. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But clay therapy is reported to
            have cured more than 50 cases of Buruli ulcer to date, the
            team reports. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"It not only stops the infection,
            but allows the body to regenerate tissues," says Giese. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The Holy Grail in all this is if
            you could figure this out, it opens up a whole new world of
            fighting pathogenic bacteria." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A long history</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Clays have long been used for
            stomach aches, paper processing, sealing wells and other
            applications. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But the long history of bogus
            clay cures and the fact that clay has such lowly origins has
            made clay research proposals a hard sell to funding
            agencies, Giese says. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The previous uses have been low
            tech," he says, adding that clay particles are truly
            nature's own nanotechnology. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"I think that if clay was not
            synonymous with mud and dirt, we would be much further
            along." </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Scientists have found a
            surprising way to turn off the process that creates fat
            cells – at least in mice. Results show growing mice exposed
            every day to a very slight vibration grew up leaner. This
            ScienCentral video explains more. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Good Vibrations</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The young mice in Clinton Rubin's
            lab don't look like they're exercising; they're just nosing
            around a plastic tub looking either for something to eat or
            a way out. But, these mice will grow up leaner than a
            similar group of mice elsewhere in the lab. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The difference is that these mice
            are spending 15 minutes a day for 15 weeks being vibrated
            ever so slightly in a tub that rests on a platform that
            looks like a giant pizza box attached to electronics. The
            vibrations are very slight, so slight many people can't feel
            the vibration, only hear the hum. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In tests at his lab at Stony
            Brook University lab, Rubin and his team showed that after
            the vibration regimen, the mice had 28 percent less fat in
            their torsos than another group of the same kind of mice who
            ate the same amount of food, and had the same amount of
            exercise. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Writing in the Proceedings of the
            National Academy of Sciences, Rubin explained that the
            vibrations, "also reduced key risk factors in the onset of
            type II diabetes." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rubin explains that his interest
            is in how physical signals – outside influences of
            mechanical, electrical and thermal signals – can influence
            the body. While his research has centered on bones, that
            work has taken a temporary detour into fat because both bone
            cells and fat cells, along with muscle, come from the same
            stem cells. Stem cells are special cells the body generates
            that can then turn into other cells as the body needs them.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rubin describes the physical
            signals impact on the body as similar to a truck driving
            over the bridge and temporarily slightly deforming the
            bridge. He says, "What happens (in the body) is the bones
            are actually (slightly) deformed (through exercise). Our
            studies are really looking at and our focus has always been
            on how these little distortions or loads in the bone signal
            cells to stimulate adding bone or to take it away." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">He says they began studying fat
            when, "We thought that 'hey' if these mechanical signals are
            actually stimulating stem cells to become bone cells, maybe
            they're not becoming fat cells." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">What is noteworthy is how little
            vibration is needed to coax the stem cells in these growing
            mice to produce bone, instead of fat. Rubin says it's about,
            "one one-thousandth of the magnitude of a signal you might
            get while you're running." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rubin sums up the research as
            trying to test if the stem cells can be influenced. He says,
            "We're thinking of these (stem) cells, these precursors to
            fat or to bone having to make a choice… The evidence is
            there that we are helping the stem cells make that
            decision." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rubin is quick to point out that
            they were not studying whether vibrations could burn any fat
            that's already present, but instead to inhibit production of
            new fat cells. He says that's important because, "If you
            never allow fat cells to be established, you can't get fat."
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The research could have
            implications in cases such as preventing childhood obesity,
            an increasingly common situation that's been blamed on
            eating habits and lack of exercise. He says, "if we could
            suppress the formation of fat cells, we could actually
            suppress the incidence of obesity. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rubin cautions that the research
            does not mean it's time to go for a ride on your washing
            machine or seek out other mechanical vibrations. He warns
            vibrations can cause many kinds of medical problems.
            Instead, especially for adults who already have pounds they
            need to shed, the best way to lose that fat is through the
            basics, diet and exercise. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This research was published
            online the week of October 22, 2007 in the Proceedings of
            the National Academy of Sciences and was funded through
            grants from the National Institutes of Health, NASA and with
            a W.H. Coulter Translational Research Award. <br>

              <p><b>Herbal Extract Found To Increase Lifespan</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><i>ScienceDaily</i> (Dec. 10,
            2007) — The herbal extract of a yellow-flowered mountain
            plant indigenous to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia
            increased the lifespan of fruit fly populations, according
            to a University of California, Irvine study. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Flies that ate a diet rich with
            Rhodiola rosea, an herbal supplement long used for its
            purported stress-relief effects, lived on an average of 10
            percent longer than fly groups that didn’t eat the herb. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">“Although this study does not
            present clinical evidence that Rhodiola can extend human
            life, the finding that it does extend the lifespan of a
            model organism, combined with its known health benefits in
            humans, make this herb a promising candidate for further
            anti-aging research,” said Mahtab Jafari, a professor of
            pharmaceutical sciences and study leader. “Our results
            reveal that Rhodiola is worthy of continued study, and we
            are now investigating why this herb works to increase
            lifespan.” </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In their study, the UC Irvine
            researchers fed adult fruit fly populations diets
            supplemented at different dose levels with four herbs known
            for their anti-aging properties. The herbs were mixed into a
            yeast paste, which adult flies ate for the duration of their
            lives. Three of the herbs – known by their Chinese names as
            Lu Duo Wei, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and San Zhi Pian – had no
            effect on fruit fly longevity, while Rhodiola was found to
            significantly reduce mortality. On average, Rhodiola
            increased survival 3.5 days in males and 3.2 days in
            females. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rhodiola rosea, also known as the
            golden root, grows in cold climates at high altitudes and
            has been used by Scandinavians and Russians for centuries
            for its anti-stress qualities. The herb is thought to have
            anti-oxidative properties and has been widely studied. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Soviet researchers have been
            studying Rhodiola since the 1940s on athletes and
            cosmonauts, finding that the herb boosts the body’s response
            to stress. And earlier this year, a Nordic Journal of
            Psychiatry study on people with mild-to-moderate depression
            showed that patients taking a Rhodiola extract called SHR-5
            reported fewer symptoms of depression than did those who
            took a placebo. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Jafari said she is evaluating the
            molecular mechanism of Rhodiola by measuring its impact on
            energy metabolism, oxidative stress and anti-oxidant
            defenses in fruit flies. She is also beginning studies in
            mice and in mouse and human cell cultures. These latter
            studies should help understand the benefits of Rhodiola seen
            in human trials. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Study results appear in the
            online version of Rejuvenation Research. Jeffrey Felgner,
            Irvin Bussel, Anthony Hutchili, Behnood Khodayari, Michael
            Rose and Laurence Mueller of UC Irvine participated in the
            study. Sun Ten Inc. provided the herbs. </p>

              <p><b>Dandelion Root ---&nbsp; Cancer Cure? At No Cost!</b>
              </p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Every week around 10,000 people
            die of cancer. Government figures show the death rate for
            cancer deaths has not changed in the last 10 years. Chemo
            and radiation only save around 10% of the people treated. So
            this shows our doctors don't have much to work with. As this
            article goes on, I will explain how to prepare this plant
            and how much to take. There is nothing to buy. For some
            reason, the Lord has picked me to carry these words to you.
            I am only the delivery boy, and none of this is my idea. I
            do believe every word I write here, and I'm living proof it
            works. The cost of printing is my thanks to God for giving
            me back my life and health. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A little over three years ago I
            was about done in with cancer. One morning as I was waking
            up and hoping the end would come soon, a voice came to me
            and said. "You have to do something about your prostate
            cancer. Take the root of the dandelion. Don't expect a
            miracle. It took you a long time to get in this condition."
            The voice was gone. I thought the voice was kidding to use
            the dandelion. When this voice tells you to do something,
            you do it. You must do it, like writing this article. It is
            the last thing I ever expected to do. Then I thought he
            didn't tell me how much to take or how to prepare it. As
            soon as you could blink an eye. I knew how much to take, how
            to prepare it, and it would take 4 to 6 months to cure me. I
            also knew I wasn't to make a penny on it. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">As soon as I got around that
            morning, I dug some roots and started to prepare it. About a
            week l! ater I started taking it. Three weeks later the pain
            in my back and side was gone and my bowels had improved.
            Five and one half months later they could find no cancer
            problem in me at all. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I, then wanted to find someone
            else to try it, and that was the biggest problem yet. Nobody
            seems to want to help. When I told doctors, they just smiled
            as if I was nuts. Finally, I was telling a friend about it
            and he said he had a friend that was dying of lung cancer.
            He had it in both lungs and was bed ridden. They were
            tapping his lungs. He had been given 4 to 6 weeks to live.
            After he had been on this powder about six weeks, he was up
            and around doing his chores and driving his car. He went to
            his doctor's office, and the doctors could not believe it.
            They took him to the hospital and gave him a CAT scan. They
            found no cancer lesions in his lungs and said it was a
            miracle. I then put an ad in The Northwest Herald offering
            it free, and four people's aid they would try it. Slowly one
            person told another and it spread. There was a fair amount
            of people taking it for different kinds of cancer and
            several for other things. For instance, a man lost the use
            of his immune system and was told he wouldn't be able to
            work again for three years, in six months he is now working
            ? days and feeling better. I know this is not a cure all. It
            won't help everyone or all kinds of cancer. I know it is not
            a cure for skin cancer and it hasn't had luck with brain
            tumors. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There is a doctor in Boston,
            Massachusetts that has developed a vaccine that is doing
            great things. This has been successful with prostate, colon,
            breast, liver and best of all with lung cancer. Five people
            have taken it for lung cancer and all five have been cured
            once. The immune system controls the cancer cells in your
            body. As long as the immune system is healthy, you don't
            usually have a cancer problem. When your immune system gets
            run down, it loses control of the cancer cells, and they
            start eating live cells and this is what they call cancer.
            This powder made from dandelion root has something in it
            that builds up the blood and the immune system. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">When the immune system is built
            up so far, it gets back control of cancer cells, and they do
            an about face and start cleaning up the mess they've made.
            This is why you must have a fair appetite because your body
            must build itself up and be healthy if your immune system is
            going to be strong. This will not work for people that have
            lost their appetite or are on CHEMO. Doctors try to blast
            the cancer out of your body with Chemo or radiation. By
            doing so, it destroys your immune system and appetite. These
            are the most important things your body needs to beat
            cancer. Operations also knock the immune system haywire.
            This is why so many people that have operations for cancer
            find that a short time later it has spread somewhere else. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Many of the worst diseases that
            have plagued the world have been cured quite easily. When I
            was a boy, women dreaded the goiter more than cancer. A
            little iodine in the diet cured that. For hundred of years
            the most dreaded diseases was leprosy and lockjaw. A doctor
            found he could produce penicillin from moldy bread and could
            cure them and many more things. How long has moldy bread
            been around? I'm sure scientists will find many uses for the
            powder made from the root of the dandelions besides cancer.
            I have already found it builds up the blood so you heal much
            faster. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">To make the powder from the
            dandelion root you must follow my directions to the letter.
            Any changes and it won't work. Dig a handful of dandelion
            roots any time of the year, it doesn't matter. Cut the
            leaves off just below the crown. DO NOT WASH. Then they must
            be dried around 100 degrees. I do it in an incubator with no
            water. You can also dry them under a heat light bulb if you
            raise or lower it so it's 100 degrees. You can also use the
            sun or put them in the attic if it's not too hot. It takes
            about 5 or 6 days in the incubator. I have not done this all
            the way under the heat light. When you break a root and it
            snaps it is ready to powder. Take an old iron frying pan and
            a clean hammer. Take one root at a time and place in the
            frying pan and start tapping. Don't hit hard or it will fly
            all over the place. I put my hand around the root to keep
            most of it in the pan. If it sticks to the hammer and pan,
            and doesn't crumble in your fingers, it isn't dry enough.
            Keep it up until you have enough to start. It takes about 20
            minutes to ? hour to prepare enough for a week. When you get
            used to it you can go much faster. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I have an old vessel that
            druggists used to pound pills, this goes much faster. DO NOT
            USE AN ELECTRIC GRINDER, it won't work if you do. You lose
            too much of the good part in dust. You must do it as I have
            said or don't do it at all. I've tried shortcuts, but it
            seems someone was looking over my shoulder, and I know when
            I made a mistake. I'm just an old farmer and not a
            scientist, so I wouldn't know the correct amount to take on
            my own. Now take a little over one half teaspoon once a day
            at any time and mix it with water, orange juice, etc.. Do
            not use in soft drinks, liquor, or anything hot. When mixed,
            use it all. Don't let it stand around. Keep the power in a
            dry place. After taking it three or four days, you will feel
            good, but nothing else. That is because your blood is
            building up. When you blood is happy, you're happy. In most
            cases, this will build your immune system in from three days
            to three weeks to the point it takes back control of cancer
            cells and thus the cancer stops spreading. In most cases it
            is going to help. There is no body feeling as it works. You
            just feel a little better each week. After three weeks most
            of the pain will be gone in your back and you know it's
            working if you had pain there like I did. If you have bone
            cancer in the spine, it will take three months to work. This
            is not an overnight cure. It took a while to get in this
            condition and it will take a while for your body to heal.
            The sooner you start, the quicker you will be over cancer.
            Young people heal faster than old people, but it will help
            at any age. I know because I'm 80 and have been taking it
            for over three years. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">No cancer has come back and no
            side effects except when my body has had enough, it lets me
            know by getting heart burn. Then I back off some. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Some people get stomach aches
            when they need less. It also means your cancer is under
            control and you don't need as much. You will also find you
            probably won't catch a cold while you are taking it full
            strength. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The biggest enemy for this root
            is Chemo. The stronger the Chemo, the less chance the power
            has to help you as Chemo tears your immune system and
            appetite down, two of the most important things you need to
            cure cancer. There is only a ten percent chance Chemo will
            cure you. With no chemo, your chances are 75 to 80% but you
            must take it every day. Don't let your doctor give you that
            old treat if you turn him down that goes, "If you want to
            throw your life away, I can't stop you". Just remember that
            90% of the people that take his advice and take chemo are in
            the cemetery. Don't blame the doctor, he is doing his best
            with what he has to work with or you could ask for a written
            guarantee. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I have only mentioned cancers
            that I know people have had and used this root. It should
            help pancreas cancer if taken before the appetite is gone
            and most body cancer. This is food, not a drug. It shouldn't
            interfere with medicine your doctor may be giving you. Only
            two doctors have told patients to keep taking the power when
            they have made a miracle recovery. The rest of the doctors
            have run the power down and blasted the people even if the
            cancer has disappeared. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The medical world is not going to
            accept this easily. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Going back to not washing the
            roots and leaving a little soil on them, it is for your own
            good. A good bit of immunity comes from the soil, it starts
            as soon as you are born. Your fingers touch something, and
            you put them in your mouth. A little dirt at first, and more
            as you grow older and start crawling. Then everything you
            touch goes in the mouth. When children go outside to play
            and when they come in, they are the dirtiest around the
            mouth and hand. The hands go in their mouths no matter how
            dirty they are. Many diseases and bacteria live in the
            ground, but they don't seem to cause any trouble but it does
            build up the immune system. Some animals can't live if they
            can't eat a certain amount of soil. If you read this article
            over, you will see it! all goes back to common sense. I wish
            all of you people with cancer and other problems the best. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The dandelion root power you can
            buy at a Health Food Store is not made the same way. It is
            not known to help cancer. </p>

              </p>
              <p><b>Author Unknown</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">It is found that mixture of Honey
            and Cinnamon cures most of the diseases. Honey is produced
            in most countries of the world. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Ayurvedic as well as Yunani
            medicine have been using honey as a vital medicine for
            centuries. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Scientists of today also accept
            honey as a "Ram Ban" (very effective) medicine for all kinds
            of diseases. Honey can be used without any side effects for
            any kind of diseases. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Today's science says that even
            though honey is sweet, if taken in the right dosage as a
            medicine, it does not harm diabetic patients. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Weekly World News, a magazine in
            Canada, on its issue dated 17 January, 1995 has given the
            following list of diseases that can be cured by Honey and
            Cinnamon as researched by western scientists. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">HEART DISEASES: Make a paste of
            honey and cinnamon powder, apply on bread, chappati, or
            other bread, instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly
            for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries
            and saves the patient from heart attack. Also those who
            already had an attack, if they do this process daily, they
            are kept miles away from the next attack. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Regular use of the above process
            relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In
            America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated
            patients successfully and have found that as age the
            arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged;
            honey and cinnamon revitalizes the arteries and veins. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">INSECT BITES: Take one part honey
            to two parts of lukewarm water and add a small teaspoon of
            cinnamon powder, make a paste and massage it on the itching
            part of the body slowly. It is noticed that the pain recedes
            within a minute or two. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">ARTHRITIS: Arthritis patients may
            take daily, morning and night, one cup of hot water with two
            spoons of honey and one small teaspoon of cinnamon powder.
            If taken regularly even chronic arthritis can be cured. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In a recent research conducted at
            the Copenhagen University, it was found that when the
            doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one
            tablespoon Honey and half teaspoon Cinnamon powder before
            breakfast, they found that within a week out of the 200
            people so treated practically 73 patients were totally
            relieved of pain and within a month, mostly all the patients
            who could not walk or move around because of arthritis
            started walking without pain. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">HAIR LOSS: Those suffering from
            hair loss or baldness, may apply a paste of hot olive oil,
            one tablespoon of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder
            before bath and keep it for approx. 15 min. and then wash
            the hair. It was found to be effective even if kept on for 5
            minutes. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">BLADDER INFECTIONS: Take two
            tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in
            a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the
            germs in the bladder. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">TOOTHACHE: Make a paste of one
            teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and
            apply on the aching tooth. This may be applied 3 times a day
            till the tooth stops aching. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">CHOLESTEROL: Two tablespoons of
            honey and three teaspoons of Cinnamon Powder mixed in 16
            ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol patient, was
            found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10%
            within 2 hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, if
            taken 3 times a day, any Chronic cholesterol is cured. As
            per information received in the said journal, pure honey
            taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">COLDS: Those suffering from
            common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm
            honey with 1/4 spoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This
            process will cure most chronic cough, cold and clear the
            sinuses. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">INFERTILITY: Yunani and Ayurvedic
            Medicine have been using honey for thousands of years to
            strengthen the semen of men. If impotent men regularly take
            two tablespoon of honey before going to sleep, their problem
            will be solved. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In China, Japan and Far-East
            countries, women, who do not conceive and need to strengthen
            the uterus, have been taking cinnamon powder for centuries.
            Women who cannot conceive may take a pinch of cinnamon
            powder in half teaspoon of honey and apply it on the gums
            frequently throughout the day, so that it slowly mixes with
            the saliva and enters the body. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A couple in Maryland, USA, had no
            children for 14 years and had lost hope of having a child of
            their own. When told about this process, husband and wife
            started taking honey and cinnamon as stated above; the wife
            conceived after a few months and had twins at full term. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">UPSET STOMACH: Honey taken with
            cinnamon powder cures stomachache and also clears stomach
            ulcers from the root. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">GAS: According to the studies
            done in India &amp; Japan, it is revealed that if honey is
            taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">IMMUNE SYSTEM: Daily use of honey
            and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and
            protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks.
            Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and
            iron in large amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the
            white blood corpuscles to fight bacteria and viral diseases.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">INDIGESTION: Cinnamon powder
            sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food,
            relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">INFLUENZA: A scientist in Spain
            has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient, which
            kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from flu. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">LONGEVITY: Tea made with honey

            tea. Drink 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 times a day. It keeps the skin
            fresh and soft and arrests old age. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Life spans also increases and
            even a 100 year old, starts performing the chores of a
            20-year-old. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">PIMPLES: Three tablespoons of
            Honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste. Apply this
            paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next
            morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks, it
            removes pimples from the root. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">SKIN INFECTIONS: Applying honey
            and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts
            cures eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">WEIGHT LOSS: Daily in the morning
            1/2 hour before breakfast on an empty stomach and at night
            before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in
            one-cup water. If taken regularly it reduces the weight of
            even the most obese person. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Also, drinking of this mixture
            regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body
            even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">CANCER: Recent research in Japan
            and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the
            stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients
            suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one
            tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for
            one month 3 times a day. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">FATIGUE: Recent studies have
            shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather
            than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior
            citizens, who take honey and cinnamon power in equal parts,
            are more alert and flexible. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Dr. Milton who has done research
            says that a half tablespoon honey taken in a glass of water
            and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, taken daily after
            brushing and in the afternoon at about 3.00 p.m. when the
            vitality of the body starts to decrease, increases the
            vitality of the body within a week. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">BAD BREATH: People of South
            America, first thing in the morning gargle with one teaspoon
            of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water. So their
            breath stays fresh throughout the day. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">HEARING LOSS: Daily morning and
            night honey and cinnamon powder taken in equal parts restore
            hearing. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Natural silicate materials,
            including zeolite clinoptilolite, have been shown to exhibit
            diverse biological activities and have been used
            successfully as a vaccine adjuvant and for the treatment of
            diarrhea. We report a novel use of finely ground
            clinoptilolite as a potential adjuvant in anticancer
            therapy. Clinoptilolite treatment of mice and dogs suffering
            from a variety of tumor types led to improvement in the
            overall health status, prolongation of life-span, and
            decrease in tumors size. Local application of clinoptilolite
            to skin cancers of dogs effectively reduced tumor formation
            and growth. In addition, toxicology studies on mice and rats
            demonstrated that the treatment does not have negative
            effects. In vitro tissue culture studies showed that finely
            ground clinoptilolite inhibits protein kinase B (c-Akt),
            induces expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 tumor
            suppressor proteins, and blocks cell growth in several
            cancer cell lines. These data indicate that clinoptilolite
            treatment might affect cancer growth by attenuating survival
            signals and inducing tumor suppressor genes in treated
            cells. </p>

            Dr Kelton Tremellen, who conducted the study, says while
            infertility has often been seen as a women's issue, men's
            infertility accounts for more than 50 per cent of in-vitro

          <p style="text-align: left;">Eighty-year-old Ram Rati
            considers sand an essential part of her daily diet and eats
            it before breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rati, who lives in Chinhar in
            Lucknow, told Asian News International: "When young, I tried
            it for fun once. Since then, I am used to it. My brothers
            and relatives pestered me to quit it but it was all in vain.
            I eat on an average around one or one-and-a-half kilos of
            sand per day." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Shikha, Rati's granddaughter,
            said: "The doctor said if she has no health problems, let
            her eat. We think it suits her health." </p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Scientists have pinpointed an
            unlikely potential weapon in the war against obesity -
            seaweed. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">They found rats given fucoxanthin
            --- a pigment in brown kelp --- lost up to 10% of their body
            weight, mainly from around the gut. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">They hope fucoxanthin can be
            developed into a slimming supplement or a drug that targets
            harmful fat. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The Hokkaido University research
            was presented to an American Chemical Society meeting in San
            Francisco. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The problem remains that
            medication, however good, will only ever plaster over the
            cracks </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Brown kelp, Undaria pinnatifida,
            is a key ingredient of Japanese miso soup. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But the researchers said drinking
            large quantities of the soup in an effort to lose weight
            would have little effect. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Fucoxanthin is tightly bound to
            proteins in the seaweed and not easily absorbed in its
            natural form. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Double effect</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The researchers, led by Dr Kazuo
            Miyashita, said it might take another three to five years
            before a slimming pill based on fucoxanthin was available to
            the public. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The compound is found at high
            levels in several different types of brown seaweed. But it
            is absent from green and red seaweeds, which are also used
            in Asian cooking. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Dr Miyashita's team studied the
            effects of fucoxanthin on more than 200 rats and mice. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">They found it fought flab on two
            fronts. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In obese animals, the compound
            appeared to stimulate a protein called UCP1 which causes fat
            to be broken down. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The protein is found in a type of
            fat called white adipose tissue, which is responsible for
            the thickening of the girth dubbed "middle-age spread". </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Research has shown that excess
            amounts of fat around the midriff are particularly linked to
            heart disease and diabetes. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The pigment also caused the liver
            to produce a compound called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),
            which can help cut levels of "bad" cholesterol associated
            with obesity and heart disease. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">No adverse side effects were seen
            in the animals used in the study. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Lifestyle key</b> </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Dr Ian Campbell, medical director
            of the charity Weight Concern, said a 5% to 10% weight loss
            was comparable with existing anti-obesity drugs. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But he added: "We don't know in
            how many humans this would be achieved, nor for how long. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The possibility of it being
            side-effect free is attractive but it is a long way away
            from being anything resembling an anti-obesity pill. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The problem remains that
            medication, however good, will only ever plaster over the
            cracks. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The hard fact is that only a
            significant change in lifestyle will ever achieve long-term
            meaningful weight loss and it is here that we should be
            focusing our efforts." </p>

              <p><b>Kim Tae-gyu</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A team of South Korean scientists
            on Sunday claimed to have created a ``cellular fountain of
            youth,’’ or a small molecule, which enables human cells to
            avoid aging and dying. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The team, headed by Prof. Kim
            Tae-kook at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
            Technology, argued the newly-synthesized molecule, named
            CGK733, can even make cells younger. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The findings were featured by the
            Britain-based Nature Chemical Biology online early today and
            will be printed as a cover story in the journal’s offline
            edition early next month. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``All cells face an inevitable
            death as they age. On this path, cells became lethargic and
            in the end stop dividing but we witnessed that CGK733 can
            block the process,’’ Kim said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``We also found the synthetic
            compound can reverse aging, by revitalizing
            already-lethargic cells. Theoretically, this can give youth
            to the elderly via rejuvenating cells,’’ the 41-year-old
            said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Kim expected that the
            CGK733-empowered drugs that keep cells youthful far beyond
            their normal life span would be commercialized in less than
            10 years. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Other researchers here heaped
            praises on the discovery but they were cautious about the
            practical therapeutic application of the new substance. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``Obviously, it is an innovative
            finding. But we need to see whether or not CGK733 could
            really rejuvenate cells inside human bodies without
            generating side effects,’’ Prof. Kim Sung-hoon at Seoul
            National University said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Prof. Kim Tae-kook, however, is
            confident about the commercial viability of CGK733,
            believing the efficiency of the material was created using
            state-of-the-art magnetic nano-probe technology. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``We have the magnet-associated
            technology to identify molecular targets inside living
            cells, which allowed us to examine the mechanisms of CGK733
            directly,’’ Kim said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``Unlike other research teams
            that must make candidates materials for drugs without being
            able to see their intra-cell activities, we know the precise
            mechanism of CGK733. So we have the better chance of making
            a success of the substance,’’ he continued. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, Kim basked in global
            recognition last June when he and his associates developed a
            technology dubbed MAGIC, short for magnetism-based
            interactive capture. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">MAGIC uses fluorescent materials
            to check whether any drug can mix with targeted proteins
            inside the cell. The results were globally recognized by
            being printed by the U.S.-based journal Science at the time.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">``MAGIC is kind of a source
            technology to see inside cells. Based on the method, we also
            found a pair of promising substances that can deal with
            cancers,’’ Kim said. </p>

                    Kittens</font></b> </p>
              <p><b>by</b> </p>
              <p><b>Jane Bunce</b></p>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A COMMON parasite can increase a
            women's attractiveness to the opposite sex but also make men
            more stupid, an Australian researcher says. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">About 40 per cent of the world's
            population is infected with Toxoplasma gondii, including
            about eight million Australians. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Human infection generally occurs
            when people eat raw or undercooked meat that has cysts
            containing the parasite, or accidentally ingest some of the
            parasite's eggs excreted by an infected cat. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The parasite is known to be
            dangerous to pregnant women as it can cause disability or
            abortion of the unborn child, and can also kill people whose
            immune systems are weakened. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Until recently it was thought to
            be an insignificant disease in healthy people, Sydney
            University of Technology infectious disease researcher Nicky
            Boulter said, but new research has revealed its
            mind-altering properties. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"Interestingly, the effect of
            infection is different between men and women,'' Dr Boulter
            writes in the latest issue of Australasian Science magazine.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"Infected men have lower IQs,
            achieve a lower level of education and have shorter
            attention spans. They are also more likely to break rules
            and take risks, be more independent, more anti-social,
            suspicious, jealous and morose, and are deemed less
            attractive to women. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"On the other hand, infected
            women tend to be more outgoing, friendly, more promiscuous,
            and are considered more attractive to men compared with
            non-infected controls. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"In short, it can make men behave
            like alley cats and women behave like sex kittens''. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Dr Boulter said the recent Czech
            Republic research was not conclusive, but was backed up by
            animal studies that found infection also changes the
            behaviour of mice. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The mice were more likely to take
            risks that increased their chance of being eaten by cats,
            which would allow the parasite to continue its life cycle. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Rodents treated with drugs that
            killed the parasites reversed their behaviour, Dr Boulter
            said. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Another study showed people who
            were infected but not showing symptoms were 2.7 times more
            likely than uninfected people to be involved in a car
            accident as a driver or pedestrian, while other research has
            linked the parasite to higher incidences of schizophrenia. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The increasing body of evidence
            connecting Toxoplasma infection with changes in personality
            and mental state, combined with the extremely high incidence
            of human infection in both developing and developed
            countries, warrants increased government funding and
            research, in particular to find safe and effective
            treatments or vaccines,'' Dr Boulter said. </p>

            </center>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A new device that promotes
            bone-cell formation may be fore runner to therapies for
            humans. Queensland University of Technology graduate Dr.
            Gwynne Hannay has promoted bone cell growth in vitro by
            replicating mechanical and electrical growth stimuli. "I
            have taken bone cells and put them in the physical
            environment they would experience in the body, and then
            varied the stimulants to extract a beneficial environment
            for tissue growth," said Hannay. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The most beneficial environment
            was one in which both kinds of stimuli, mechanical and
            electrical, were applied together. This produced a
            synergistic effect, where the results were greater with both
            stimuli than the sum of the results of each stimulus applied
            alone. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"Previous research has looked at
            both of these stimulants individually, but not together,
            neglecting the fact that both are occurring in normal
            healthy bone during fracture healing," said Hannay. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Normal bone fractures in healthy
            young people can take six to eight weeks to heal. This
            process can take longer in older people. "We find bones can
            get half way through the healing process but won't heal
            properly and with an aging population this is a growing
            problem," said Hannay. He believes his invention might be
            able to “significantly reduce the healing time” of fractures
            and broken bones. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"In the future we might be able
            to make a device utilizing these combined stimulants that
            could be attached to the body and help heal the bone,” said
            Hannay. This therapy could be used for breaks that do not
            heal properly in elderly people, as well as to speed up the
            recovery process. </p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A chance discovery by a Berkshire
            allotment-holder that a plant widely available in garden
            centres has the same effect on men as Viagra has been
            confirmed by experts at one of the world's leading botanical
            institutions. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The plant is winter-flowering
            heather, and botanists at the Royal Botanic Gardens,
            Edinburgh, many of them heather experts who have recognised
            the source of its active ingredient, now expect it to be the
            next must-have plant in British gardens. Demand is already
            high. Nurseries and garden centres in some areas are having
            trouble finding sufficient supplies as word spreads of the
            plant's unexpected properties. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A spokesman for Wyevale Garden
            Centres, which has 106 UK branches, said: "At first, it was
            just a trickle of inquiries, but now stores are virtually
            being besieged each weekend. We have had men buying dozens
            of the plants and, at one store in Croydon, there were men
            old enough to know better fighting over the last remaining
            trays." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The latest gardening craze was
            triggered by a discovery by a 55-year-old furniture
            restorer, Michael Ford, on his allotment. He was always
            experimenting with drinks made from different plants and one
            day he tried an infusion from his winter-flowering heather.
            He said: "The effect was almost immediate. I had to stay in
            my potting shed for an hour or so before I could decently
            walk down the street." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">He then contacted the Royal
            Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, famous for their work with the
            heather family, to see if they could offer an explanation.
            They could. Botanist Alan Bennell said: "This first surfaced
            when East European chemists reported finding a Viagra-type
            chemical in the floral tissues of winter-flowering heaths.
            They were able to isolate measurable amounts of material
            that is an analogue of the active principle in Viagra." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Winter-flowering heather, he
            explained, belongs to the genus Erica, a close relative of
            our own native heather. He said: "As yet, the active
            ingredient has not been found in these British forms, but it
            is proving to be most concentrated in many of the widely
            available hybrids sold as winter-flowering heather in garden
            centres. Particularly potent are forms of Erica carnea, the
            Alpine heather, whose range extends into the Balkans. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">"The work of these biochemists
            and physiologists - much of it disrupted and lost during the
            ravages of war - is now coming to light." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">From the limited amount of
            information available, it is suggested the Viagra-analogue
            is best extracted by steeping the detached small flowers in
            neat alcohol. An infusion of about 20g of flowers in 100ml
            of fluid liberates the active principle. A quality
            full-strength vodka (at least 40 per cent) is also
            effective. Mr Bennell added: "There is some confusion
            whether oral consumption or topical application is more
            effective." </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">But not everyone is happy about
            this new discovery. One woman shopping at a Wyvales in
            Dorking yesterday said: "It's amazing. My husband has never
            shown any interest in gardening before, but now he's out
            there night and day fussing over his heathers. Frankly, I
            preferred it when he left the garden to me and wasn't so
            frisky." </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>A group
            of phytochemical compounds extracted from whole germinated
            or not germinated black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) and/or
            their dry milled fractions such as seed coats or hulls and
            cotyledons is described. These phytochemicals are classified
            as phenolics, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, coumarins,
            and tannins, triterpenes such as saponins, phytosterols and
            other antioxidant compounds that proved to be effective to
            decrease cancer proliferation of hormone dependent mammary
            (MCF-7), hormone independent hepatic (HepG2) and colon
            (Caco2) cancer cells. They also effectively protect against
            chemical damage induced with DMBA and furthermore prevented
            cancer induced by this chemical in Wistar rats and also
            reduced tumor size when consumed after tumor detection.
            Methanol, acetone, ethanol, water and mixtures of these
            solvents were used to obtain the extracts from raw, cooked,
            and germinated black beans of different varieties, both from
            the whole grain and the hulls. The black bean malting
            process produced extracts rich in aglycone forms of the
            previous mentioned compounds that were more biologically
            active against MCF-7 cancer cell proliferation. Both raw
            extracts, C-18 HPLC refined extracts and fractionated
            extracts may be used in the treatment, prophylaxis,
            amelioration or defense against a variety of hormone
            dependent and independent cancers. The extracts and
            compounds have additional utilities, e.g., lower cholesterol
            or lower oxidation of LDL and/or inhibit cholesterol
            synthesis (or the enzyme therefor) and/or reduce liver
            fibrosis and/or reduce symptoms of menopause and/or
            stimulate calcium absorption and/or have estrogenic activity
            such as feminizing estrogenic activity and/or are
            antioxidants, for instance, as an active ingredient in a
            nutritional supplement and/or as a food, cosmetic or
            pharmaceutical antioxidants or colorants. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">A traditional folk remedy, known
            among people in Mississippi’s hill country for at least a
            century, may provide some relief without all the worries of
            DEET and other harsh chemicals. The National Center for
            Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi
            have isolated compounds in the American beautyberry plant,
            Callicarpa americana, that may keep chomping insects away.
            “My grandfather would cut branches with the leaves still on
            them and crush the leaves, then he and his brothers would
            stick the branches between the harness and the horse to keep
            deerflies, horseflies and mosquitoes away,” said Charles T.
            Bryson, an ARS botanist in Stoneville, Miss. “I was a small
            child, maybe 7 or 8 years old, when he told me about the
            plant the first time. For almost 40 years, I’ve grabbed a
            handful of leaves, crushed them and rubbed them on my skin
            with the same results.” Bryson told his supervisor about the
            folklore repellent, and in 2004 the USDA-ARS at the UM
            natural products research center began investigating the
            beautyberry plant as a potential natural insect repellent.
            Charles Cantrell, an ARS chemist in Oxford, and Jerry Klun,
            an ARS entomologist in Beltsville, Md., confirmed that the
            natural remedy wards off biting insects, such as ticks, ants
            and mosquitoes: “I’ve rubbed the leaves on my arms, and it
            works,” Cantrell said. </p>
