      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Carey Lea</span> discovered the
      preparation of so-called "allotropic" and "intermediate" silver in
      1889 while he was studying reductions of silver nitrate.
      "Allotropic" is however a misnomer, . In 1925, Dr. Richard
      Zsigmondy, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Göttingen,
      received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his study of Lea's
      "allotropic" silver under the ultramicrosope. Dr. Zsigmondy found
      that such silver actually was a monoatomic colloid of ordinary
      silver, not another isotope.<br>
      <br>
      Lea determined that silver occurs in "allotropic", "intermediate",
      and ordinary forms. Ordinary silver is protean in nature. The
      aqueous solutions are colloidal monoatoms, and give perfectly
      clear solutions. The several forms of "allotropic" silver (a-Ag)
      dry with their particles in optical contact with each other, thus
      forming continuous films that are beautifully colored, perfect
      mirrors. Strong acids and pressure will convert a-Ag to the normal
      form. There are three forms of a-Ag, and all are unstable.<br>
      <br>
      There is also a very stable "intermediate form" of silver (i-Ag)
      which is easy to prepare. It occurs as bright gold-yellow or green
      crystals with a metallic luster. Treatment with a very dilute
      solution of ferric chloride will enhance the appearance of its
      foliar structure, interpenetrating with plant-like ramifications,
      or fine acicular crystals up to 1 inch long.<br>
      <br>
      Intermediate silver is hard, tough, and unaffected by pressure. It
      is nearly as indifferent to oxidizing and chlorizing agents as is
      normal silver. Intermediate silver can be formed from the
      allotropic varieties by light, heat, or chemical action.<br>

      "... The form of allotropic silver which I have obtained may be
      classified as follows : --<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      A. Soluble, deep red in solution, mat lilac, blue, or green whilst
      moist, brilliant bluish metallic when dry.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      B. Insoluble, derived from A, dark reddish brown whilst moist,
      when dry somewhat resembling A.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      C. Gold, silver, dark broze whilst wet, when dry exactly
      resembling gold in burnished lumps. Of this form there is a
      variety which is copper-colord. Insoluble in water, appears to
      have no corresponding soluble form. <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      All these forms have several remarkable properties in common :<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      I. That of drying with their particles in optical contact and
      consequently, forming a continuous film...<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      II. The halogen reaction ... very beautiful color reactions are
      obtained...<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      III. The action of acids ... instantly convert the allotropic
      forms of silver into normal gray silver... absolutely without the
      separation of gas...<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      IV. Physical Condition ... All these allotropic forms of silver
      are easily reduced to an impalpable powder...<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. Soluble Allotropic Silver</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      A solution of ferrous citrate added to one of a silver salt
      produces instantly a red liquid (Ferrous sulfate gives the same
      reaction but is less advantageous). These red solutions may either
      exhibit tolerable permanency or may decolorize, letting fall a
      black precipitate. It is not necessary to prepare the ferrous salt
      in an isolated form, a mixture of ferrous sulfate and sodium
      citrate answers perfectly.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      When however concentrated solutions are used with a large excess
      of ferrous sulfate and a still larger one of alkaline citrate, the
      liquid turns almost completely black. It should be stirred very
      thoroughly for several minutes to makes sure that the whole of the
      precipitated silver citrate is acted upon by the iron. After
      standing for 10 or 15 minutes, the liquid may be decanted and will
      leave a large quantity of a heavy precipitate of fine lilac-blue
      color. It is best to adhere closely to certain proportions:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Of a 10% solution of silver, 200 cc may be placed in a
      precipitating jar. In another vessel are mixed 200 of a 30%
      solution of ferrous sulfate and 280 cc of a 40% solution of sodic
      citrate.( The same quantity of ferrous sulfate or of sodic citrate
      in a larger quantity of water will occasion much loss of the
      silver product). I think some advantage is gained by neutralizing
      the ferrous solution, which has a strong acid reaction, with the
      solution of sodium hydroxide: as much may be added as will not
      cause a permanent precipitate. To the quantities already given,
      about 50 cc of 10% soda solution. The reaction takes place equally
      well without the soda, but I think the product is a little more
      stable with it. ) The mixed solution is to be added at once to the
      silver solution.<br>
      <br>
      The beautiful lilac shade of the precipitate is rather ephemeral.
      It remains for some time if the precipitate is left under the
      mother water, but when thrown upon a filter, it is scarcely
      uncovered before the lilac shade disappears and the precipitate
      takesa deep blue color, without losing its solubility. It may be
      washed either on a filter or by decantation, with any saline
      solution in which it is insoluble and which does not affect it too
      much. On the whole, ammonium nitrate does best, but sodic nitrate,
      citrate, or sulfate may be used, or the corresponding ammonia
      salts. Although in pure water the precipitate instantly dissolves
      with an intense blood red color, the presence of 5 or 10% of any
      of these salts renders it perfectly insoluble. I have usually
      proceeded by adding to the precipitate ( after decanting the
      mother water as completely as possible...), a moderateamount of
      water; for the above quantities about 150 cc. Much less would
      dissolve the precipitate but for the salts present: this much will
      dissolve the greater part but not the while, which is not
      necessary. A little of a saturated solution of ammonium nitrate is
      to be added, just enough to effect complete precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      As the material appears continually to change, the amount of
      washing needed must depend upon the object in view. If wanted for
      analysis, the washing must be repeated many times until a ferric
      salt ceases to come away, but no amount of washing will eliminate
      it entirely. After 7 or 8 solutions in pure water and as many
      precipitations, the material is to be filtered and then the
      ammonium nitrate washed out with 95% alcohol until the filtrate
      leaves nothing on evaporation. The substance at this point is
      still soluble in water, though much less so than at first. During
      the washing the solubility slowly but steadily diminishes, a fact
      rendered noticeable by less and less ammonium nitrate being needed
      to precipitate it from its solution...<br>
      <br>
      ... The freshly precipitated material dissolves to a blood red
      liquid, by great dilution yellowish red. The purified substance
      gives a darker red solution, which with dilution remains still red
      ...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Insoluble Form of the
        Foregoing</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The solution of the blue product just described is influenced in a
      remarkable way by the addition of almost any neutral substance. So
      far I hve not found any that does not precipitate it. Not only
      saline solutions do this, but even a solution of gum arabic.<br>
      <br>
      Neutral salts may precipitate the silver in either a soluble or an
      insoluuble form. Alkaline sulfates, nitrates and citrates throw
      down the soluble form, magnesium sulfate, cupric sulfate, ferrous
      sulfate, nickel sulfate, potassium bichromate and ferrocyanide,
      barium nitrate, even silver nitrate and other salts throw down a
      perfectly insoluble form. The soluble form cosntitutes a bluish or
      bluish black precipitate; the insoluble, a purple brown, which by
      repeated washings continually darkens.<br>
      <br>
      What is very curiosu is that the insoluble form may be made to
      return to the soluble condition. many substances are capable of
      effecting this change. Sodium borate does so, produing a brown
      solution, potassium and sodium sulfate produce a yellowish red
      solution and ammonium sulfate a red one. None of these solutions
      has the same blood-red color as the original solution; the form of
      silver seems to change with the slightest change of ondition.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions used must be extremely dilute, otherwise the silver,
      though rendered soluble in pure water by them, will not dissolve
      in the solution itself, a singular complication of effects... The
      insoluble substance also is readily soluble in ammonia. The
      solution has a fine red color, and not the yellowish red of the
      sodium sulfate solution.<br>
      <br>
      Most neutral salts act in one or another ways just described,
      precipitating the solution of the blue substance A in either the
      soluble or the insoluble form, the latter soluble in ammonia, but
      sodium nitrite is an exception; its solution effects an entire
      change and renders the substance wholly insoluble, probably
      reconverting it to normal silver...<br>

      <br>
      ... The two insoluble forms of allotropic silver which I have
      described as B and C; B, bluish green, C rich golden color, show
      the following curious reaction. A film of B, spread on glass and
      heated in a water stove to 100 C for a few minutes becomes
      superficially bright yellow. A similar film of the gold-colored
      substance C treated in the same way, acquires a blue bloom. In
      both case it is the surface only that changes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Sensitiveness to Light</span> --
      All these forms of silver are acted upon by light. A and B acquire
      a brownish tinge after some hours' exposure to sunlight. With C
      the case is quite different, the color changes from that of red
      gold to that of pure yellow gold... Complete exhaustion of air and
      light is certainly favorable to permanence...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Specific gravity</span> -- The
      allotropic forms of silver show a lower specific gravity that that
      of normal silver.<br>
      <br>
      In determining the s.g. it was found essential to keep the s.g.
      bottle after placing the material in it for some hours under
      vauum. Films of air attach themselves obstiantely to the surfaces
      and esape but slowly even in vacuo.<br>
      <br>
      ... Blue substance B gave sp.gr. 9.58 and the yellow substance C,
      sp.gr. 8.51. The sp.gr. of normal silver after melting is 10.5.
      That of finely divided silver is 10.62 ...<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Relations of the Yellow to the
        Blue Forms</span> -- ... In previous papers there has been
      described a crystalline state intermediate between these active
      forms and ordinary silver, which intermediate condition, while
      retaining the bright yellow color of the active form is nearly as
      indiferrent to reagents as ordianry silver. Into this intermediate
      state both the yellow and blue forms are capable of passing, and
      apparently the intermediate states of both kinds of allotropic
      silver are identical: the intermediate form of blue silver is
      yellow. Thus when lumps of blue silver are heated in a test tube
      to about 180 C they assume a gold color and luster. The same
      changes take place at the same temperature when films of blue
      silver are placed in a hot air bath...<br>
      <br>
      Blue silver can be converted into yellow at ordinary temperatures
      and consequently with retention of its active properties. This is
      accomplished through the delivery of sulfuric acid. When a
      solution of silver is obtained by the action of sodium hydroxide
      and dextrine on silver nitrate (*) it appears to contain the blue
      variety, for if allowed to precipitate spontaneously by long
      standing, or if precipitated by acetic acid, dilute nitric acid,
      or by many neutral substances, it gives a form of silver which is
      dark red while moist and dries with a blue surface color. (It is
      always a little difficult to characterize these substances by
      their colors since the surface color which they show when dry is
      mostly complementary to their color when wet. The surface color is
      much the more characteristic, I have adopted the course of naming
      them by that.<br>
      <br>
      (*) 40 gr each of naOH and of yellow or brown dextrine (not white)
      are dissolved in 2 liters water and 28 gr Ag-Nitrate in solution
      are added in small quantities in turn, with frequent stirring, so
      that several hours shall lapse before the last portion is added.
      The solution is always slightly turbid when viewed by reflected
      light, by which it shows a beautiful deep green color. By
      transmitted light it is deep red, and when diluted, absolutely
      transparent. By diminishing the proportion of silver nitrate to
      one-half, a solution nearly or quite clear by reflected as well as
      by transmitted light is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The behavior of the red solution obtained by soda and dextrine
      with dilute sulfuric is very interesting and instructive. When 100
      cc of solution are poured into 100 cc of water to which 3 cc
      sulfuric acid has been added, a dark red precipitate falls which,
      when dry, especially in films, is blue. The mixed liquid from
      which the precipitate is formed is acid. Increasing the proportion
      of acid to 4, 5 and 6 cc successivley, the substance obtained has
      a green surface color becoming more yellowish green in proportion
      as the acid is increased in quantity. With 7-1/2&nbsp; the
      substance no longer dries green but yellow. Increased proportions
      of acid produces substances drying with a coppery shade.<br>
      <br>
      It will be seen that from a single solution, and using one
      substnace only as a precipitant, we can obtain the whole range of
      different forms of allotropic silver, simply by varying the
      proportions of the precipitant.<br>
      <br>
      That these forms of silver should subsist in the presence of
      sulfuric acid in excess is remarkable. For the most part the
      presence of this acid tends to quickly convert allotropic to
      ordinary silver. For example, bright yellow allotropic silver
      obtained with ferrous tartrate was washed on a filter with water
      containing 1/500 its volume of sulfuric acid: in two hours the
      entire mass was converted into gray ordinary silver.<br>
      <br>
      ...The substances precipitated with the least acid, have a very
      splendid luster, and this luster diminshes steadily as the
      proportion of acid is increased...<br>
      <br>
      But we can also obtain the converse of this reaction. Just as the
      solution which naturally would yield the blue product, can be made
      to yield the yellow by the presence of excess of strong acid, so
      the solution which normally yields the yellwo substance, may be
      made to produce blue ( or rather green ) silver by adding alkali.
      Thus a mixture of dilute solutions of ferrous sulfate and of
      Rochelle salt added to mixed solutions of silver nitrate and of
      Rochelle salt rsults in the formation of fold-colored silver. But
      if we add a little sodium hydroxide to the iron solution or the
      silver mixture, we shall get a bluish green product, whose
      properties show that it belongs to the blue class and not to the
      yellow...<br>
      <br>
      There is a well marked tendency of acids to give rise to the
      formation of the yellow product and of alkalies to the blue. But
      this is a tendency only. Both substances can be produced from
      neutral solutions, and slight changes are sufficient to alter the
      product formed. Thus, ferrous tartrate, in dilute solution acting
      on silver tartrate gives rise to the formation of the gold-colored
      substance, but when citrates are substituted, the blue substance
      is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Action of Light on Blue Silver</span>
      -- This action differs with different varieties; it was more
      especially exmained with the form that is obtained from the&nbsp;
      soda dextrine silver solution already described by pouring the
      solution into an equal bulk of water to which sulfuric acid had
      been added in the proportion of 4 cc per 100 cc water. This form
      was selected because it is easy to obtain with great constancy of
      result, and because it is one of the forms of blue silver most
      sensitive to light.<br>
      <br>
      Exposed to light, this substance first becomes more distinctly
      blue, losing a slight greensih shade. With continued exposure it
      passes to a yellow-brown shade. and finally to a perfectly pure
      golden-yellow of great brilliancy and luster. The last is the
      intermediate or crystalline form.<br>
      <br>
      The action of light on this form of silver is remarkable in this
      respect, that its first effect is to increase the sensitiveness to
      reagents.<br>
      <br>
      This result was so unexpected and a priori so improbable, that it
      was subjected to the most careful verification before being
      accepted... Upon this form of silver light has a reversing action,
      first exalting its sensitiveness, then completely destroying it...
      [ like silver bromide ]<br>
      <br>
      Three of the principal modes of formation of allotropic silver
      are:<br>
      <br>
      (1) reduction of silver citrate or tartrate by ferrous nitrate or
      tartrate;<br>
      (2) acting on silver nitrae or oxide by dextrine and fixed
      alkaline hydroxide;<br>
      (3) acting on silver nitrate or carbonate by tannin and fixed
      alkali carbonates. <br>
      <br>
      Now if in either of these cases we interrupt the action before it
      is complete by adding an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid we
      shall obtain a dark chestnut-brown or sometimes purple-brown
      substance which on examination proves to be a mixture of silver
      subchloride and protochloride. When, after complete removal of the
      excess hydrochloric by boiling with distilled water, the substance
      is treated with cold dilute nitric acid, that portion of the
      subchloride which is not combined with the normal chloride is
      broken up and there remains protochloride of a very rich and
      intense rose-color. It is perhaps the best means for obtaining
      silver protochloride... Hydrochloric acid, though without action
      on ordinary silver, is capable of forming a variable quantity of
      protochloride when placed in contact with allotropic silver.<br>
      <br>
      I have not met with any exception to this general principle that
      when a reaction leading to the formation of allotropic silver is
      interrupted by the addition of hydrochloric acid, subchloride is
      abundantly formed as one of the products.<br>
      <br>
      In all such cases the reduction is evidently indirect. The silver
      does not lose at once the whole of its oxygen, but appearently
      passes through an intermediate form, prodbably Ag4O, the reduction
      of which tends to the formation of allotropic silver.<br>

      The three forms of allotropic silver which were described in the
      June number of this Journal -- the blue soluble and the blue and
      the yellow insoluble -- are not to be understood as the only forms
      which exist, but as the best marked only. The substance is protean
      and exhibits other modification not yet studied. No other metal
      than silver appears to be capable of assuming such a remarkable
      variety of appearances. Every color is represented. I have
      obtained metallic silver blue, green ( many shades of both ), red,
      yellow and purple, In enumerating these colors I do not refer to
      interference colors produced superficially by reagents, also
      wonderfully brilliant, but to body colors....<br>
      <br>
      Two of the insoluble forms of allotropic silver, the gold-colored
      and the blue, show in many respects a close relationship and
      almost identical reactions... Blue allotropic silver (dark red
      when moist, becoming blue in drying ) is very stable. It may be
      exposed for weeks in a moist state on a filter, or be placed in a
      pasty condition in a corked vial and so kept moist for months,
      without alteration.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The gold-colored form on the contrary tends constantly to revert
      to ordinary silver. This is especially the case when it is moist,
      so that from the time of its formation, it must be separated from
      its mother water and washed as rapidly as possible, otherwise it
      loses its brilliancy and purity of color and changes to a dark
      dull gray form of normal silver. On the filter, its proper color
      is black with a sort of yellow shimmer ( the gold color appearing
      as it dries ) often, especially if allowed to become uncovered by
      the water during washing, it will change superficially to gray
      (When well washed this form can be preserved for a time in the
      moist condition in a corked vial). But if the washing is done
      rapidly with the aid of a vacuum filter, the allotropic silver
      obtained, when allowed to dry in lumps, or brushed on paper or
      glass, is at least equal to pure gold in color and brilliancy...<br>
      <br>
      When gold-colored allotropic silver is gently heated in a test
      tube it undergoes a remarkable change in cohesion. Before heating
      it is brittle and easily reduced to fine powder. After heating it
      has greatly increased in toughness and cannot be pulverized at
      all.<br>
      <br>
      Both the gold-yellow and the blue forms resemble normal silver in
      disengaging oxygen from hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      Many substances which react little if at all with ordinary silver,
      attack the gold-colored and the blue allotropic silver with
      production of very beautiful colors due to the formation of thin
      films and resulting interference of two reflected rays. In my
      previous papers I called this the "halogen reaction" because first
      obtained by the action of halogens... But many other reagents will
      produce the same or similar effects. These are:<br>
      <br>
      Sulfides -- Paper brushed over with either the gold, the
      copper-colored, or the bluish green substance exposed to the vapor
      of ammonium sulfide, or immersed in a dilute solution of it,
      assume beautiful hues, though less brilliant than those obtained
      in other ways.<br>
      <br>
      Potassium permanganate -- in dilute solution produces blue, red
      and green colors.<br>
      <br>
      Potassium ferricyanide -- in moderately strong solution gradually
      attacks allotropic silver with production of splendid blue, purple
      and green coloration.<br>
      <br>
      Phosphorus acid -- produces gradually a rather dull coloration.<br>
      <br>
      The color reaction is produced finely by substances which readily
      part with a halogen such as ferric and cupric chlorides, sodium
      hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid to which potassium bichromate has
      been added, and corresponding bromine and iodine compounds... I
      obtained effects of the same sort but in much weaker degree with
      alkaline haloids. But with purer products, the results have been
      different. There is at first some darkening, but no true color
      reaction and the allotropic silver appears to be gradually
      converted into normal, so that it is no longer capable of giving
      the brilliant color reaction with potassium ferricyanide, but,
      like normal silver, takes a pale and faint coloration only.<br>
      <br>
      The perchlorides of platinum, gold, and tin do not give the color
      reaction, though by analogy one would expect that they should,
      since they can lose chlorine with formation of a lower chloride.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Action of Light</span> -- in a
      previous paper was mentioned the remarkable fact that the gold-
      and copper-colored forms of allotropic silver can be converted
      first into yellow and finally into white normal silver by the
      continued action of light. Earlier specimens of the blue form
      became brown by exposure, but purer one since obtained are
      likewise converted into yellow by exposure, becoming continually
      lighter as the action is continued. The conversion from the darker
      shades to a bright yellow with full metallic luster is very easy,
      but [ unstable ]. Since then I have obtained the gold-colored
      silver in a more sensitive form, giving a perfectly white product
      by exposure for half that time.<br>
      <br>
      The white silver thus obtained has all the character of ordinary
      silver and does not show the color reaction with ferric and cupric
      chloride, potassium ferrocyanide, etc. Just in proportion to the
      exposure to light, the ability to give this color reaction
      diminishes, so that after a day's exposure, when the exposed part
      has become bright yellow, the color reagents scarcely affect this
      yellow, whilst the protected part becomes intense blue, purple, or
      green. In this way it is easy to observe the gradual effect of
      light as it changes the allotropic silver into ordinary silver.<br>

            Produced on Allotropic Silver by iodine.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Allotropic silver, in its moist and plastic state, may be bruished
      over paper and gives on drying a continuous and brilliant coating
      resembling metalic leaf. When a small crystal of iodine is placed
      on paper that has been this coated, rings of remarkable beauty are
      obtained. A funnel or beaker should be inverted over the paper to
      prevent distortion by currents of air [ unless desired --
      controlled air flow produces beautiful patterns ]<br>
      <br>
      That iodine is capable of producing interference rings ( Nobili's
      rings ) on metalic surfaces has long been known, and Robert Hunt
      has described their formation on surfaces of normal silver... The
      contrast between the pale and faded-looking products produced on
      normal silver, and the lustrous and glowing hues given by the
      allotropic, is very striking. One cannot help wishing that this
      splendid coloration could be made to do service for obtaining
      natural colors by photographic processes.<br>
      <br>
      As to the durability of these products... protected from light and
      air they endure for several months at least. Both the bluish green
      insoluble silver B, and the gold-colored C produce these effects;
      the gold-colored is the better suited of the two...<br>
      <br>
      The general properties of this substance can be much better
      observed in the thin films obtained by brushing the moist
      substance over paper than in lumps. The films thus obtained are
      bright metallic green, and this green evidently results from a
      mixture of blue and yellow... When the films are examined by
      normal light reflected from them at a large incidence with the
      normal and a Nicol's prism or an achromatized prism of calc-spar
      is interposed between the film and the eye, it becomes at once
      apparent that the blue and yellow light are oppositely polarized.
      The yellow light is polarized in the plane of incidence, and the
      blue light perpendicularly to that plane. All specimens show the
      yellow light, but the quantity of blue light is very variable and
      is directly connected with the amount of washing applied to the
      precipitate. The more it is washed the more yellow predominates.
      To see the blue form in its full beauty, a little of the red
      solution may be precipitated with a very little magnesium or
      aluminum sulfate and filtered. As soon as the liquid has drained
      off and without any washing, the deep bronze-colored substance is
      to be brushed on paper. On drying it has all the appearance of a
      bright blue metal with a remarkable luster. The mirrors obtained
      on glass are so beautiful and so perfect that it seems as if this
      property might have useful applications...<br>
      <br>
      Crystalization -- On one occasion this substance was obtained in a
      crystaline form. Some crude red solution had been set aside in a
      corked vial. Some weeks after, it was noticed that the solution
      had become decolorized, with a crystaline deposit... [ consisting
      ] of short black needles and thin prisms. Evidently the saline
      matters present had balanced the silver so nearly as not to cause
      an immediate precipitation, but a very gradual one only. The
      mother water was decanted, and a few drops of pure water added. No
      sultion took pace: the crystals were therefore of material B, the
      insoluble form. The contact of pure water instantly destroyed the
      crystalization and the substance dried with a bright green metalic
      luster. Contact with pure water evidently tends always to bring
      this form of silver into the colloidal state, sometimes soluble
      and sometimes not; whilst the contact with certain neutral salts
      renders it crystaline...<br>
      <br>
      To obtain the substance in a pure condition suitable for analysis,
      it is necessary to choose a precipitant not giving an insoluble
      product with either citric or sulfuric acid. Magnesium sulfate or
      nickel sulfate answers well. A very dilute solution is made of it
      and the red solution of A is to be filtered into it. The
      preipitate soon settles. A large quantity of water is to be poured
      on, and then washing by decantation can be continued to three
      decantations, after which the substance remains suspended. It can
      be made to subside by adding a very small quantity of magnesium
      sulfate ( 0.25 gr/liter is sufficient). The substance may then be
      filtered and washed....<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">C. Gold Yellow and Copper-Colored
        Silver</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It has been long known that golden-yellow specks would
      occasionally show themselves in silver solutions, but could not be
      obtained at will and the quantity was infinitesimal. Probably this
      phenomenon has often led to a supposition that silver might be
      transmuted into gold. This yellow product, however, is only an
      allotropic form of silver, but it has all the color and brilliance
      of gold...<br>

      <br>
      ... In the present case we have to consider three distinct forms
      (1) allotropic, (2) intermediate (3) ordinary silver. We notice
      that (1) can with the utmost facility and in several ways be
      converted into (2) and (3), and that (2) can always be converted
      into (3), but that these transformations can by no possibility be
      reversed. To convert ordinary silver into allotropic we must as a
      first step dissolve it in an acid: that is, convert it from a
      polymerized to an atomic form, and only from this atomic form can
      allotropic be obtained...<br>
      <br>
      [ There may exist ] three possible moleular forms of silver, viz.:
      atomic, molecular and polymerized.,,<br>
      <br>
      Silver may exist in three forms: 1st. Allotropic silver which is
      protean in its nature; may be soluble or insoluble in water, may
      be yellow, red, blue or green, or may have almost any color, but
      in all its insoluble varieties always exhibits plasticity, than
      is, if brushed in a pasty state upon a smooth surface its
      particles dry in contact, and with brilliant metallic luster. It
      is chemically active. 2nd. The intermediate form, which may be
      yellow, or green, always shows metallic luster, but is never
      plastic and is almost as indifferent chemically as white silver.
      3d. Ordinary silver... Further, that alotropic silver can always
      be converted, either into the intermediate form, or directly into
      ordinary silver; that the intermediate form, or directly into
      ordinary silver; that the intermediate form, or directly into
      ordinary silver, that the intermediate form can always be
      converted into ordinary silver, but that these processes can never
      be reversed, so that to pass from ordinary silver to allotropic it
      must first be rendered atomi by combination, and then be brought
      back to the metallic form under condition which chek the atoms in
      uniting. Allotropic silver is affected by all forms of energy, and
      this effect is always in one direction, namely, towards
      condensation...<br>

            Silver, soluble &amp; insoluble forms</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allotropic Silver obtained
            with Dextrine and Alkaline Hydroxide</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      When dextrine is dissolved in a solution of potassium or sodium
      hydroxide and silver nitrate is added, keeping the hydroxide in
      moderate excess, the silver is at first thrown down in the form of
      the well known brown oxide. This brown color presently changes to
      a reddish chocolate shade and at the same time the silver begins
      to dissolve. In a few minutes the whole has dissolved to a deep
      red color, so intense as to be almost black. A few drops poured
      into water give it a splendid red color of perfect transparency.
      Examination with the spectroscope leaves no doubt that we have to
      do with a true solution.<br>
      <br>
      It is interesting to obseve that silver can be held in solution in
      neutral, acid and alkaline liquids. In the first process which I
      which I published, in which silver citrate is reduced by a mixture
      of sodic citrate and ferrous sulfate, the latter may be used
      either in acid solution or it may be first neutralized with
      alkaline hydroxide, so that that form of silver is held in
      solution in either a neutral or an acid liquid. The form that is
      obtained with the aid of dextrine dissolves most freely in the
      strongly alkaline liquid in which it is produced, and when dilute
      nitric or sulfuric acid is added the silver is precipitated. But
      with acetic the precipitation is very incomplete: the solution
      retains a brown color and contains silver. Even the addition of a
      large excess of strong acetic acid fails to throw down any more
      silver. it follows therefore that while this form of silver is
      most freely soluble in a strongly alkaline it is also soluble to
      some extent in one that is either neutral or acid.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate when once formed appears to be almost insoluble. A
      small portion of it stirred up with distilled water gives no
      indication of solution. But if a quantity is thrown is washed on a
      filter, as soon as the mother water is washed out the liquid runs
      through of a muddy red, and if this filtrate be allowed to stand
      it deposits an insoluble portion and then has a fine rose-red
      color and perfect transparency. Notwithstanding the beautiful
      color it contains a trace of silver only, so great is the coloring
      power of the metal. Sometimes if the alkaline stnads for a month
      or two the silver becomes spontaneously insoluble; most of it
      falls to the bottom as a deep red substance, but part remains in
      suspension with a bright brick red color. The difference between
      this and the true solution as originally formed is extremely well
      marked.<br>
      <br>
      Dextrine is a very variable substance and different specimens act
      very differently. Common brown dextrine seems to do better than
      the purified forms.<br>
      <br>
      Convenient proportions are as follows: in two liters of water 40
      grams of sodium hydroxide may be dissolved and an equal quantity
      of dextrine, filtering if necessary. 28 grams of silver nitrate
      are to be dissolved in a small quantity of water and added by
      degrees at intervals. Complete solution readily takes place.
      Although the liquid contains less than 1% of metallic silver it
      appears absolutely black, when diluted, red, by great dilution
      yellowish. With some specimens of dextrine the solution remains
      clear, with others it soon becomes a little turbid.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the most interesting reaction which this solution shows,
      is that with disodic phosphate. A little phosphate is sufficient
      to throw down the whole of the silver although both solutions are
      alkaline. When a gram of phosphate in solution is added to 100 cc
      of silver solution the color becomes bright red, sometimes
      scarlet, and the whole of the silver is presently on the filter
      has precipitated. This precipitate on the filter has a color like
      that of ruby copper, which color it retains during the first
      washing, but after a few hours washing with distilled water the
      color changes to a deep Nile green and at the same time it becomes
      slightly soluble, giving a port wine colored solution. With more
      washing this solubility may disappear.<br>
      <br>
      It is a general fact that all these forms of silver, however
      various their color, have both a body and a surface color and
      these two colors tend always to be complementary. The body color
      is that shown by the precipitate while still moist; it is also
      visible when a thin coat is brushed over paper, a coat so thin
      that light passes through it, is reflected by the paper and
      returned again through the film. But when a thick and opaque film
      is applied, the body color disappears and only the complementary
      surface is visible...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allotropic Silver obtained with
        Tannin and alkaline Carbonates</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Tannin (gallotannic acid) in alkaline solution reduces silver
      nitrate to metallic silver in the allotropic form. Tannin acts
      more strongly than dextrine and therefore does best with
      carbonated alkali, dextrine best with alkaline hydroxide, although
      either substance will produce the reation with either form of
      alkali and, though less advantageously, with ammonia. Tannin with
      sodium carbonate gives a very perfect solution of silver, quite
      free from the turbidity that is apt to characterize the dextrine
      solution. The color of this solution is likewise very intense: one
      containing 1% of silver is quite black, by dilution deep yellowish
      red. It has very much the same characteristics as the preceding,
      bt is rather more stable. To obtain it, 24 grams of dry sodium
      carbonate may be dissolved in 1200 cc of water. A 4% solution of
      tannin is to be made and filtered, of this 72 cc are to be added
      to the solution just named; of silver nitrate, 24 grams dissolved
      in a little water are to be added by degrees. Solution takes place
      almost instantly as each successive portion is added. The solution
      after standing a day or two may be decanted or filtered from a
      small quantity of black precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      When the solution is treated with a very dilute acid, as for
      example, nitric acid diluted with 20 volumes of water, allotropic
      silver is precipitated in the solid form. It dries with a
      brilliant metallic surface color of a shade different from the
      foregoing and somewhat dificult to exactly characterize, a sort of
      bluish-steel gray.<br>
      <br>
      I do not find that blue allotropic ( in which is included the
      green and steel-gray varieties) can be reduced to any one definite
      type. On the contrary, its variations are endless. Slight
      differences in the conditions under which the solutions are formed
      or in the mode of precipitation give quite different products. For
      example, of ten products obtained give quite different products.
      For example, of ten products obtained with tannin and sodium
      carbonate in different proportions, several were easily and
      completely soluble in ammonia, some were slightly soluble and some
      not at all. Some specimens not at all soluble in water become so
      by moistening with dilute phosphoric acid: they did not dissolve
      in the acid but when it was removed they had beceome soluble in
      water. On other specimens phosphoric acid had no such effect. Some
      solutions are scarcely affected by acetic, others are partly
      precipitated, others almost but not quite wholly. The films spread
      on paper vary very much in their relations to light; some are
      readily converted into the yellow intermediate form, whilst others
      are very insensitive. The least sensitive specimens seemed to be
      those for which dilute nitric acid had been used as a precipitant.
      They had a steel-gray color. Precipitation by acetic acid seems to
      tend to a greenish metallic surface color and greater
      sensitiveness. Different specimens also vary very much as to
      permanency; this character is also affected by the amount of
      washing received: thorough washing tends to permanency.<br>
      <br>
      In some ways the blue, gray and green forms seem more closely
      related to the black or dark gray forms of normal silver, for they
      tend in time to pass into them, while on the contrary,&nbsp;
      gold-colored silver, if pure, tends with time to change to bright
      white normal silver on the surface, with dark or even black silver
      underneath.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Action of other Carbonates</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Tannin is capable of producing allotropic silver, not only in the
      presence of the arbonates of potassium and sodium, but also with
      those of lithium and ammonia and also with the carbonates of
      calcium, magnesium, barium and strontium. The action of the last
      named carbonate has been more particularly examined. it yields
      allotropic silver of a dark red color while moist, drying with a
      rich bluish green metallic surface color in thick films, in very
      thin films transparent red. It is probable that the substances
      with which tannin produces these reactions would be further
      reduced by investigation...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nature of the " intermediate
        substance"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It has been mentioned in previous papers that when allotropic
      silver is converted into normal silver by the action of heat it
      passes through a perfectly well marked intermediate state. In this
      state it retains the gold-yellow color and high luster but none of
      the other properties of the original form. Oxidizing and
      chlorizing agents show nearly the same indifference as with
      ordinary silver. While other allotropic silver is soft and easily
      reduced to powder the intermediate substnace is hard and tough.
      When a glass rod is drawn over a film of allotropic silver it
      leaves behind it a white trace of ordinary silver. The
      intermediate substance shows no such reaction: the trace of a
      glass rod does not differ from the rest of the film and even hard
      burnishing produces no change in the color. Continued exposure to
      sublight brings about the same alteration to the intermediate form
      and it takes place spontaneously with time.<br>
      <br>
      At that time no explanation could be found as to the nature of the
      change. It proves however to be a passage into a crystalline form.
      Some films spread on paper were exposed to the action of a very
      dilute solution of ferric chloride. It chanced that one of these
      films had undergone a partial change into the intermediate; the
      unchanged portion was darkened by the ferric solution, while the
      portion that had passed into the intermediate form retained its
      bright gold-yellow color and luster rendering it thus
      distinguishable. The figures which it exhibited were strikingly
      crystaline. One portion showed a foliated struture such as if
      formed by interpenetrating crystals, other parts showed
      ramifications, with something of a plant-like form. Another part
      exhibited a sheaf of acicular cystals nearly parallel in
      direction, half an inch to an inch long and fine as hairs...<br>
      <br>
      This change to the crystaline condition does not seem to be
      peculiar to gold-colored silver...<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      The stable "intermediate form" of silver (i-Ag) is easy to
      prepare. It occurs as bright gold-yellow or green crystals with a
      metallic luster. Treatment with a very dilute solution of ferric
      chloride will enhance the appearance of its foliar structure,
      interpenetrating with plant-like ramifications, or fine acicular
      crystals up to 1 inch long.<br>
      <br>
      Intermediate silver is hard, tough, and unaffected by pressure. It
      is nearly as indifferent to oxidizing and chlorizing agents as is
      normal silver. Intermediate silver can be formed from the
      allotropic varieties by light, heat, or chemical action. The
      simplest preparation is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      "...It is a little curious that its permanency seems to depend
      entirely on details in the mode of preparation. I have found many
      ways of obtaining it, but in a few months the specimens preserved
      changed spontaneously, to normal silver. This happened even in
      well closed tubes. The normal silver produced in this way is
      exquisitely beautiful. It has a pure and perfect white color like
      the finest frosted jewelers' silver, almost in fact exceeding the
      jeweler's best products. I found, however, one process by which a
      quite permanent result could be obtained... <br>
      <br>
      In forming the blue product which I have called A, very
      concentrated solutions were necessary. C on the contrary is best
      obtained from very dilute ones. The following proportions give
      good results:<br>
      <br>
      Two mixtures are required: No. 1 containing 200 cc of a 10%
      solution of silver nitrate, 200 cc of 20% solution of Rochelle
      Salt [Sodium potassium tartrate] and 800 cc of distilled water.
      No. 2, containing 107 cc of a 30% solution of ferrous sulfate, 200
      cc of a 20% solution of Rochelle salt and 800 cc of distilled
      water. The second solution (which must be mixed immediately before
      using only) is poured into the first with constant stirring. A
      powder, at first glittering red, then changing back to black,
      falls, which on the filter has a beautiful bronze appearance.
      After washing it should be removed whilst in a pasty condition and
      spread over watch glasses or flat basins and allowed to dry
      spontaneously. It will be seen that this is a reduction of silver
      nitrate by ferrous sulfate. The metallic silver formed by
      reduction with ferrous citrate and ferrous tartrate is in an
      allotropic condition; with ferrous oxalate this result does not
      seem to be produced.<br>
      <br>
      Although the gold-colored silver (into which the nitrate used is
      wholly converted) is very permanent when dry, it is less so when
      wet. In washing, the filter must be kept always full of water;
      this is essential. It dries into lumps exactly resembling highly
      polished gold... By brushing a thick paste of this substance
      evenly over clean glass, beautiful cold-colored mirrors are
      obtained; the film seems to be entirely continuous and the mirror
      is very perfect.<br>
      <br>
      By continuous washing the precipitate changes somewhat, so that in
      drying it takes on a coppery rather than a golden color, and is
      rather less lustrous, though still bright and brilliant...<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reactions --</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The most characteristic reactions of gold-colored allotropic
      silver are those with the strong acids. When normal silver reduced
      with milk sugar and alkaline hydroxide is left in contact with
      strong hydrochloric acid even for several hours there is no
      action, and the silver after thorough washing dissolves in warm
      dilute nitric acid without residue. With allotropic silver
      similarly treated chloride is always formed. But strong
      hydrochloric acid instantly converts allotropic to ordinary silver
      and consequently only atrace of chloride is produced. By largely
      diluting the acid the conversion is retraded and the proportion of
      chloride is greatly increased. Thus for example when ordinary
      hydrochloric acid is diluted with 50 times its volume of water and
      is made to act on allotropic silver, about one-third is converted
      to chloride. Probably the whole would be but for the simultaneous
      conversion to normal silver. This double action is curious and
      strongly differentiates allotropic from ordinary silver. Even with
      the same acid diluted with 100 volumes of water, there is a
      gradual but complete conversion to white silver accompanied by the
      production of a not inconsiderable quantity of silver chloride.<br>
      <br>
      Neutral chlorides also act strongly upon allotropic silver even
      when much diluted...<br>
      <br>
      Sulfuric acid diluted with 50 volumes of water has no action upon
      n ormal silver. It quickly converts allotropic silver to normal
      but at the same time dissolves a little of it...<br>
      <br>
      Ammonia seems to be without a converting action but dissolves a
      trace. It will be shown in a future paper that there exists a form
      of allotropic silver abundantly soluble in ammonia...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intermediate Form</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Allotropic silver presents itself in an almost endless variety of
      forms and colors... Most of these varieties seem to be capable of
      existing in two conditions, of which one is more active than the
      other.<br>
      <br>
      If we coat a chemically clean glass plate with a film of
      gold-colored allotropic silver, let it dry, first in the air, then
      for an hour or two in a stove at 100 C, and then heat the middle
      of the plate carefully over a spirit lamp, we shall obtain with
      sufficient heat a circle of whitish gray with a bright, lustrous
      golden ring round it, somewhat lighter and brighter than the
      portion of the plate that has not been changed by heat. This ring
      consists of what I propose to call the "intermediate form".<br>
      <br>
      With sulfuric acid diluted with four times its bulk of water and
      allowed to cool, an immersion of one or two seconds converts a
      film on glass or on pure paper wholly to the intermediate form...<br>
      <br>
      Its properties are better seen by using a film formed on pure
      paper, one end of which is heated over a spirit lamp to a
      temperature just below that at which paper scorches. The change is
      sudden and passes over the heated portion like a flash. Examining
      the changed part, we find :<br>
      <br>
      1st. That it has changed from a deep gold to a bright yellow gold
      color.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. When subjected to a shearing stress it does not whiten or
      change color in the slightest degree.<br>
      <br>
      3rd. It is much harder, as is readily perceived in burnishing it.<br>
      <br>
      4th. It no longer shows the color reaction with potassium
      ferricyanide and ferric chloride, changing only by a slight
      deepening of color.<br>
      <br>
      Of these characteristic changes the second is the most remarkable.
      The gold-colored silver in its original condition changes with
      singular facility to white silver; almost any touch, any friction
      or pressure effects the conversion... Heat effects the same change
      but with an intermediate stage at which pressure no longer
      produces any action.<br>
      <br>
      The intermediate form is distinguished from normal silver almost
      solely by its bright yellow color and its higher luster. This last
      difference is very striking when a film on glass is heated in the
      same manner as above. The central parts in changing to white
      silver become wholly lusterless, while the circle of intermediate
      retains all its original luster. Its continuity is so complete,
      that if viewed through glass, it still acts as a mirror.<br>
      <br>
      This change may be either molecular or depend on dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      The latter seems doubtful for the change cannot be brought about
      by dessication...<br>
