      <p>&nbsp;Hydrazine sulfate is a chemical that has been studied as
        a treatment for cancer and as a treatment for the body wasting
        (i.e., cachexia) associated with this disease. <br>
        &nbsp;It has been claimed that hydrazine sulfate limits the
        ability of tumors to obtain glucose, which is a type of sugar
        used by cells to create energy. <br>
        &nbsp;Hydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence
        of lung, liver, and breast tumors in laboratory animals,
        suggesting it causes cancer. <br>
        &nbsp;There is only limited evidence from animal studies that
        hydrazine sulfate has anticancer activity. <br>
        &nbsp;Hydrazine sulfate has shown no anticancer activity in
        randomized clinical trials, and data concerning its
        effectiveness in treating cancer-related cachexia are
        inconclusive. <br>
        &nbsp;Hydrazine sulfate has been marketed in the United States
        as a dietary supplement or a nutraceutical by some companies;
        however, its use as an anticancer drug outside of clinical
        trials has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
        Administration. </p>
      <p><b>General Information</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate has been investigated as an anticancer
        treatment for more than 30 years. It has been studied in
        combination with established treatments as a chemotherapy agent.
        It has also been studied as a treatment for cancer-related
        anorexia (loss of appetite) and cachexia (loss of muscle mass
        and body weight). Similar to other hydrazine compounds, it has a
        core chemical structure that consists of two nitrogen atoms and
        four hydrogen atoms. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate is marketed in the United States as a dietary
        supplement /nutraceutical by some companies. In the United
        States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs.
        Therefore, premarket evaluation and approval by the U.S. Food
        and Drug Administration (FDA) are not required unless specific
        disease prevention or treatment claims are made. The FDA can,
        however, remove from the market dietary supplements that it
        deems unsafe. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer
        treatment outside of clinical trials has not been approved by
        the FDA. The FDA has not approved the use of hydrazine sulfate
        for any medical condition. </p>
      <p>To conduct clinical drug research in the United States,
        researchers must file an Investigational New Drug (IND)
        application with the FDA. To date, the FDA has granted IND
        status to at least three groups of researchers to study
        hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer.[1-3] </p>
      <p>In animal studies, hydrazine sulfate has been added to the
        drinking water or the food supply, or it has been given by
        injection. In clinical trials involving cancer patients,
        hydrazine sulfate has been administered in pills or capsules.
        Reviewed in [4] In the clinical studies conducted thus far, the
        dose and the duration of hydrazine sulfate administration have
        varied. </p>

      <p><b>History</b> </p>
      <p>During the past 90 years, hydrazine compounds have been studied
        in animal cells grown in the laboratory, in live animals, and in
        humans. Reviewed in [1] More than 400 hydrazine analogs (related
        compounds) have been screened for their ability to kill tumors.
        In 1996, a retrospective review of scientific studies in which
        the anticancer activity of hydrazine analogs was investigated
        found that 65 of 82 evaluated compounds showed some anticancer
        activity in xenograft models (tumor cells of one species
        transplanted to another species). Reviewed in [1] Of the 82
        tested compounds, seven showed activity against human tumor
        cells and were, therefore, selected for further testing in pilot
        studies and phase I clinical trials. Reviewed in [1] Among these
        seven compounds, only procarbazine (a methylhydrazine
        derivative, also called ibenzmethyzin or natulan) completed
        preliminary testing in humans. Procarbazine exhibited anticancer
        activity in patients with Hodgkin disease, melanoma, and lung
        carcinoma, and it was ultimately used in several first-line
        treatment regimens in the 1960s.[2,3] Reviewed in [1] In view of
        the initial success with procarbazine, hydrazine sulfate, which
        is similar in chemical composition, was investigated for
        anticancer activity beginning in the 1970s. During this period,
        investigation of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for
        cancer-related cachexia was also initiated. Research on
        hydrazine sulfate both as a single agent and in combination with
        standard chemotherapy regimens continued through the
        mid-1990s.[4-9] </p>
      <p>Although it was proposed in the early 1900s that hydrazine
        compounds are toxic to animals and to humans, they have been
        administered as antidepressant (e.g., iproniazid), chemotherapy
        (e.g., procarbazine), and antituberculosis (e.g., isoniazid)
        drugs. In addition to medicinal uses, hydrazine compounds have
        been used in industry and agriculture as components of rocket
        fuel, as herbicides, and as antioxidants in boiler and
        cooling-tower water. Reviewed in [10-12] Many scientists
        consider hydrazine sulfate and other hydrazine analogs to be
        cancer-causing agents, and they have expressed concern about the
        safety of these compounds.[1,10,12-21] In the 10th Report on
        Carcinogens, hydrazine and hydrazine sulfate are listed by the
        U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National
        Toxicology Program as “reasonably anticipated to be human
        carcinogens.”[22] When the antituberculosis drug isoniazid and
        hydrazine antidepressants are combined with purified DNA in the
        laboratory, they produce hydrogen peroxide and free radicals
        that can damage the DNA.[17,23] Reviewed in [14] Hydrazine
        compounds have been reported to cause mutations and chromosome
        damage in bacteria and in plant and animal cells. Reviewed in
        [10] </p>
      <p>Two mechanisms of action have been proposed for hydrazine
        sulfate to explain its potential antitumor and anticachexia
        properties. Both mechanisms involve the utilization of glucose
        (sugar), which tumors require as a main source of energy for
        growth. In one proposed mechanism, hydrazine sulfate blocks
        gluconeogenesis through inhibition of the enzyme
        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.[24] Reviewed in [25-29]
        Gluconeogenesis is a process by which extra glucose (in addition
        to that obtained from the diet) can be formed in the liver and
        the kidneys from the breakdown products of sugars, lipids
        (fats), and proteins. It has been suggested that cachexia occurs
        because the body must use increasing amounts of energy and other
        resources, including its own protein, to meet the demand for
        glucose by tumors.[24] Reviewed in [25-30] Blocking
        gluconeogenesis and interfering with the supply of nutrients to
        tumors has been proposed as one way to inhibit tumor growth and
        to prevent cachexia.[24] Reviewed in [25-30] </p>
      <p>In the second proposed mechanism, hydrazine sulfate inhibits
        tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha activity.[31-34] TNF-alpha,
        which is also known as cachectin, is one of a number of
        substances normally produced by white blood cells in the body in
        response to infection by microorganisms and in response to other
        stimuli such as tissue damage. Reviewed in [31,32,34-36]
        Higher-than-normal TNF-alpha production has been observed in
        white blood cells obtained from cancer patients. Reviewed in
        [35-37] It has been suggested that higher-than-normal levels of
        TNF-alpha can cause the anorexia, increased energy expenditure,
        and increased muscle protein breakdown seen in cancer patients.
        Reviewed in [31,35-37] Some of the muscle protein breakdown
        products would become available for gluconeogenesis. Inhibition
        of TNF-alpha activity might, therefore, inhibit tumor growth and
        prevent cachexia. </p>

      <p>Hydrazine sulfate has been studied extensively in patients with
        advanced cancer. These studies have evaluated the following: a)
        tumor response and/or survival among patients with various types
        of cancer,[1-13] b) changes in body weight,[1-6,8,10-12,14] c)
        carefully measured quality of life,[4-6,15] and d) changes in
        nutritional or metabolic status.[1,4,12,13,16,17] Clinical
        studies of hydrazine sulfate have been funded by a
        pharmaceutical company,[3] the Russian government,[7,9,10,18]
        and by grants from the National Cancer Institute
        (NCI).[1,2,4-6,8,11,12,15,16] They have also been sponsored by
        the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [5,6] and the
        Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).[4,15] </p>
      <p>The first clinical tests of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment
        for cancer were conducted in the mid-1970s by a pharmaceutical
        company.[3] In an uncontrolled study of 158 patients with
        advanced disease, it was found that 45 of 84 evaluable patients
        had subjective improvements (i.e., the patients reported an
        increase in appetite, a decrease in weight loss, an increase in
        strength, or a decrease in pain) and that 14 had objective
        improvements (i.e., there was measurable tumor regression,
        stable disease, or improvement in a cancer-related disorder) in
        response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. Among the patients
        with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18 months)
        stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor
        regression, although the extent and duration of these
        regressions were not specified. Major weaknesses of this study
        included the absence of a control (i.e., comparison) group and
        the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited patients could
        not be evaluated because of poor prognosis, missing
        documentation, insufficient duration of treatment, and/or
        concurrent therapy (i.e., therapy given at the same time) with
        other anticancer drugs.[3] </p>
      <p>In 1976, Russian investigators reported findings from 95
        patients with advanced cancer who had been treated with
        hydrazine sulfate after all previous therapy (surgery,
        chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) had failed.[9] Three
        partial responses (i.e., reductions in tumor size of greater
        than 50% observed for a period of 4 weeks or more) and no
        complete responses were noted after 1 to 5 months of treatment.
        Tumor regressions of 50% or less and stable disease (i.e.,
        cessation of tumor growth for a period of 1.5 to 2.0 months or
        more) were reported for 16 and 20 patients, respectively. </p>
      <p>In 1981, the same investigators published findings from 225
        patients with advanced disease who had been treated with
        hydrazine sulfate after all previous therapy had failed.[10] It
        appears that the 225 patients described in this second report
        [10] included the 95 patients described in the first report.[9]
        Partial responses and stable disease were reported for 4 and 95
        patients, respectively, after 1 to 6 months of treatment. No
        patient experienced a complete response. Subjective improvements
        in appetite, weight stabilization or gain, pain, fever,
        breathing, and/or mental outlook were reported by 147 patients.
      </p>
      <p>In 1995, the same Russian investigators published findings from
        740 patients with advanced cancer.[7] Once again, it appears
        that 225 of these 740 patients were described in the earlier
        reports.[9,10] Partial responses and stable disease were
        reported for 25 and 263 patients, respectively. Complete
        responses were noted for six patients. Subjective improvements
        in cancer-related symptoms were reported by 344 patients. </p>
      <p>In 1994, the same investigators reported findings from a
        clinical series involving 46 patients with malignant brain
        tumors (38 with glioblastomas, four with astrocytomas, and four
        with meningiomas) and six patients with benign brain tumors.[18]
        These patients were not described in the other reports.[7,9,10]
        All patients in this series appear to have been treated with
        surgery in addition to hydrazine sulfate therapy, and at least
        some of the patients were also treated with radiation therapy.
        Complete or partial regression of neurologic symptoms (e.g.,
        seizures, headaches, sensory and motor disorders, and
        hallucinations) was reported for 73% of the patients. In
        addition, longer-than-average survival was reported for most
        patients. Among the patients with glioblastomas, the increase in
        average survival time was from 6 months to more than 13
        months.[18] </p>
      <p>Evaluation of the findings from these Russian clinical series
        [7,9,10,18] is made difficult by the limited information
        provided about the patients and their treatment histories. In
        addition, insufficient information was given about study design
        and methodology. The absence of control groups; the receipt of
        prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation
        therapy by all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures
        of quality of life are major study weaknesses. Therefore, it is
        difficult to ascribe any of the positive findings to treatment
        with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the previously
        described clinical series, three NCI-funded clinical series
        found no complete responses or partial responses among a total
        of 79 patients treated with hydrazine sulfate.[2,8,11] In
        addition, only temporary, minor improvements in appetite, pain,
        and weight stabilization or gain were reported by the patients
        in these series. A weakness in these three clinical series was
        the absence of control groups. </p>
      <p>Findings from four placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
        trials, however, also fail to support the effectiveness of
        hydrazine sulfate as a cancer treatment in humans.[1,4-6,15] In
        these trials, survival,[1,4-6,15] objective tumor
        response,[1,4,15] and carefully measured quality of life
        [4-6,15] were major endpoints. </p>
      <p>One of the trials involved 65 patients with advanced nonsmall
        cell lung cancer and examined the effects of hydrazine sulfate
        on survival and nutritional status.[1]. In this trial, patients
        received either hydrazine sulfate or placebo in addition to a
        multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen. When all patients were
        evaluated, no improvement in survival was found with hydrazine
        sulfate therapy. In addition, no differences were noted in
        objective tumor response between the hydrazine sulfate group and
        the placebo group. However, on the basis of caloric intake and
        the maintenance of serum albumin levels, the nutritional status
        of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged better
        than that of the patients in the placebo group. However, the
        moderate increases in body weight associated with hydrazine
        sulfate use did not achieve statistical significance. </p>
      <p>A CALGB-sponsored trial also evaluated the use of hydrazine
        sulfate as a treatment for patients with advanced nonsmall cell
        lung cancer.[4,15] In this trial, 266 patients received either
        hydrazine sulfate or placebo in addition to a multiple-drug
        chemotherapy regimen. No differences in survival, objective
        tumor response, anorexia, weight gain or loss, or nutritional
        status were observed between the hydrazine sulfate group and the
        placebo group. However, the quality of life of the patients who
        received hydrazine sulfate was found to be statistically
        significantly worse than that of the patients who received
        placebo. </p>
      <p>The use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for patients with
        nonsmall cell lung cancer was also evaluated in an
        NCCTG-sponsored trial.[6] In this trial, 243 patients were
        randomly assigned to receive either hydrazine sulfate or placebo
        in addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen. No
        statistically significant differences were found between the
        hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with respect to
        either survival or quality of life. </p>
      <p>Another NCCTG-sponsored trial tested hydrazine sulfate alone
        versus placebo in the treatment of 127 patients with metastatic
        colorectal cancer.[5] In this trial, the patients who received
        hydrazine sulfate had, on average, shorter survival than the
        patients who received placebo, a finding that was statistically
        significant. There were no statistically significant differences
        between the hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with
        respect to weight gain or loss, anorexia, or quality of life. </p>
      <p>Four other clinical trials did find some objective evidence of
        benefit with hydrazine sulfate therapy.[12,13,16,17] These
        trials had either nutritional status or metabolic status as the
        primary endpoint. In a placebo-controlled, randomized trial
        involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine sulfate
        was found to improve the abnormal glucose metabolism seen in
        cancer patients.[13] In another placebo-controlled, randomized
        trial that involved 101 patients with advanced cancer and weight
        loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was associated with
        statistically significant improvements in appetite and either
        weight increase or weight maintenance.[12] However, the higher
        average caloric intake observed in this study for patients
        treated with hydrazine sulfate compared with patients treated
        with placebo was not statistically significant.[12] Two other
        clinical studies involving a total of 34 patients with either
        lung cancer or colon cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was
        able to reduce the body protein breakdown associated with cancer
        cachexia.[16,17] In view of the totality of evidence, the
        overall importance of the findings from these four clinical
        trials is not clear. </p>
      <p><b>Human/Clinical Studies</b> </p>
      <p>Most of the information presented here is summarized in a table
        located at the end of this section. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate has been studied extensively in patients with
        advanced cancer. These studies have evaluated the following: a)
        tumor response and/or survival among patients with various types
        of cancer,[1-13] b) changes in body weight,[1-6,8,10-12,14] c)
        carefully measured quality of life,[4-6,15] and d) changes in
        nutritional or metabolic status.[1,4,12,13,16,17] Clinical
        studies of hydrazine sulfate have been funded by a
        pharmaceutical company,[3] the Russian government,[7,9,10,18]
        and by grants from the National Cancer Institute
        (NCI).[1,2,4-6,8,11,12,15,16] They have also been sponsored by
        the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [5,6] and the
        Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).[4,15] </p>
      <p>The first clinical tests of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment
        for cancer were conducted in the mid-1970s by a pharmaceutical
        company.[3] In an uncontrolled study of 158 patients with
        advanced disease, it was found that 45 of 84 evaluable patients
        had subjective improvements (i.e., the patients reported an
        increase in appetite, a decrease in weight loss, an increase in
        strength, or a decrease in pain) and that 14 had objective
        improvements (i.e., there was measurable tumor regression,
        stable disease, or improvement in a cancer-related disorder) in
        response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. Among the patients
        with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18 months)
        stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor
        regression, although the extent and duration of these
        regressions were not specified. Major weaknesses of this study
        included the absence of a control (i.e., comparison) group and
        the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited patients could
        not be evaluated because of poor prognosis, missing
        documentation, insufficient duration of treatment, and/or
        concurrent therapy (i.e., therapy given at the same time) with
        other anticancer drugs.[3] </p>
      <p>In 1976, Russian investigators reported findings from 95
        patients with advanced cancer who had been treated with
        hydrazine sulfate after all previous therapy (surgery,
        chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) had failed.[9] Three
        partial responses (i.e., reductions in tumor size of greater
        than 50% observed for a period of 4 weeks or more) and no
        complete responses were noted after 1 to 5 months of treatment.
        Tumor regressions of 50% or less and stable disease (i.e.,
        cessation of tumor growth for a period of 1.5 to 2.0 months or
        more) were reported for 16 and 20 patients, respectively. </p>
      <p>In 1981, the same investigators published findings from 225
        patients with advanced disease who had been treated with
        hydrazine sulfate after all previous therapy had failed.[10] It
        appears that the 225 patients described in this second report
        [10] included the 95 patients described in the first report.[9]
        Partial responses and stable disease were reported for 4 and 95
        patients, respectively, after 1 to 6 months of treatment. No
        patient experienced a complete response. Subjective improvements
        in appetite, weight stabilization or gain, pain, fever,
        breathing, and/or mental outlook were reported by 147 patients.
      </p>
      <p>In 1995, the same Russian investigators published findings from
        740 patients with advanced cancer.[7] Once again, it appears
        that 225 of these 740 patients were described in the earlier
        reports.[9,10] Partial responses and stable disease were
        reported for 25 and 263 patients, respectively. Complete
        responses were noted for six patients. Subjective improvements
        in cancer-related symptoms were reported by 344 patients. </p>
      <p>In 1994, the same investigators reported findings from a
        clinical series involving 46 patients with malignant brain
        tumors (38 with glioblastomas, four with astrocytomas, and four
        with meningiomas) and six patients with benign brain tumors.[18]
        These patients were not described in the other reports.[7,9,10]
        All patients in this series appear to have been treated with
        surgery in addition to hydrazine sulfate therapy, and at least
        some of the patients were also treated with radiation therapy.
        Complete or partial regression of neurologic symptoms (e.g.,
        seizures, headaches, sensory and motor disorders, and
        hallucinations) was reported for 73% of the patients. In
        addition, longer-than-average survival was reported for most
        patients. Among the patients with glioblastomas, the increase in
        average survival time was from 6 months to more than 13
        months.[18] </p>
      <p>Evaluation of the findings from these Russian clinical series
        [7,9,10,18] is made difficult by the limited information
        provided about the patients and their treatment histories. In
        addition, insufficient information was given about study design
        and methodology. The absence of control groups; the receipt of
        prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation
        therapy by all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures
        of quality of life are major study weaknesses. Therefore, it is
        difficult to ascribe any of the positive findings to treatment
        with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the previously
        described clinical series, three NCI-funded clinical series
        found no complete responses or partial responses among a total
        of 79 patients treated with hydrazine sulfate.[2,8,11] In

        and weight stabilization or gain were reported by the patients
        in these series. A weakness in these three clinical series was
        the absence of control groups. </p>
      <p>Findings from four placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
        trials, however, also fail to support the effectiveness of
        hydrazine sulfate as a cancer treatment in humans.[1,4-6,15] In
        these trials, survival,[1,4-6,15] objective tumor
        response,[1,4,15] and carefully measured quality of life

        on survival and nutritional status.[1]. In this trial, patients

        of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged better

        received hydrazine sulfate was found to be statistically
        significantly worse than that of the patients who received
        placebo. </p>
      <p>The use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for patients with
        nonsmall cell lung cancer was also evaluated in an
        NCCTG-sponsored trial.[6] In this trial, 243 patients were
        randomly assigned to receive either hydrazine sulfate or placebo
        in addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen. No

        versus placebo in the treatment of 127 patients with metastatic
        colorectal cancer.[5] In this trial, the patients who received

        significant. There were no statistically significant differences
        between the hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with
        respect to weight gain or loss, anorexia, or quality of life. </p>
      <p>Four other clinical trials did find some objective evidence of
        benefit with hydrazine sulfate therapy.[12,13,16,17] These
        trials had either nutritional status or metabolic status as the
        primary endpoint. In a placebo-controlled, randomized trial
        involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine sulfate
        was found to improve the abnormal glucose metabolism seen in

        loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was associated with
        statistically significant improvements in appetite and either
        weight increase or weight maintenance.[12] However, the higher
        average caloric intake observed in this study for patients
        treated with hydrazine sulfate compared with patients treated

        lung cancer or colon cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was
        able to reduce the body protein breakdown associated with cancer
        cachexia.[16,17] In view of the totality of evidence, the
        overall importance of the findings from these four clinical
        trials is not clear. </p>
      <p>A search of the PDQ clinical trials database indicates that no
        clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate as a therapy for cancer are
        being conducted at this time. </p>

      <p><b>Adverse Effects</b> </p>
      <p>The side effects associated with hydrazine sulfate use have
        been mainly gastrointestinal and neurologic.[1-12] Nausea and/or
        vomiting, dizziness, and sensory and motor neuropathies have
        been reported.[1-12] The sensory and motor neuropathies have
        included paresthesias (abnormal touch sensations, such as
        burning or prickling, in the absence of external stimuli) of the
        upper and lower extremities (i.e., the arms and the legs,
        including the hands and the feet), polyneuritis (simultaneous
        inflammation of several peripheral nerves), and impaired fine
        motor function (e.g., an impaired ability to write).[2,5,7-9]
        Other side effects have included dry skin and/or itching,
        insomnia, and hypoglycemia.[1,2,7,9] One case of fatal liver and
        kidney failure and one case of severe encephalopathy (an injury
        to the brain) have been associated with the use of hydrazine
        sulfate.[13,14] The former case involved a man aged 55 years
        with squamous cell carcinoma of the maximillary sinus who
        purchased hydrazine sulfate from a source found on the Internet
        and proceeded to take it without medical advice or supervision.
        After 4 months he presented with evidence of renal and liver
        toxicity, which eventually resulted in death. This case
        highlights the danger of accessing materials and medical
        information on the Internet and proceeding with self- medication
        without seeking proper medical advice and supervision.[15] </p>
      <p>The side effects of hydrazine sulfate have been described as
        mild to moderate in severity, and their incidence appears to
        have been low. Most side effects are reported to resolve when
        treatment is stopped. However, limited evidence from animal
        studies suggests that hydrazine sulfate is highly toxic when
        combined with either alcohol or barbiturates.[16-18] Reviewed in

      <p><b>Overall Level of Evidence for Hydrazine Sulfate</b> </p>
      <p>Several clinical case series conducted by Russian investigators
        have indicated that hydrazine sulfate has marginal anticancer
        activity, but these results are considered inconclusive due to
        the lack of control groups and insufficient information provided
        about study methodology. Well-controlled clinical studies
        conducted in the United States have shown no evidence of
        anticancer activity. In addition, evidence concerning the
        effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for
        cancer-related cachexia and anorexia is inconclusive.
        Furthermore, hydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the
        incidence of several types of tumors in animals, and it has been
        classified as a potential carcinogen by the National Toxicology
        Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The
        use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer drug outside the
        context of clinical trials has not been approved by the U.S.
        Food and Drug Administration and, thus, cannot be recommended. </p>

          <b>Saul Green, Ph.D.</b></p>

      <p>Cachexia is the result of a complex array of metabolic
        abnormalities which results in loss of appetite, tissue wasting,
        muscle and visceral organ atrophy, weakness, and loss of fat
        stores. It may be accompanied by energy, anemia, lowered serum
        albumin, lowered immune function, lactic acidosis,
        hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and increased
        gluconeogenesis. These abnormalities alert clinicians to the
        possibility of an underlying disease. </p>
      <p>The relationship between cachexia and cancer has been known for
        some time. [1] Although cachexia is not a universal feature in
        cancer, it occurs frequently in lung, pancreatic, and gastric
        cancer. As a consequence it has been suggested that cachexia may
        contribute to death. [2,3] </p>
      <p>The awareness among oncologists of demonstrable differences
        between cachexia and starvation prompted many researchers to
        investigate the mechanisms underlying cachexia in the hope of
        reversing it. Cachexia is the result of a complex interaction
        between the growing tumor and the host; when the entire tumor is
        removed, normal metabolism and weight gain resume. </p>
      <p>Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from molecules
        which may not be sugars. This synthesis of new glucose takes
        place in tissues like liver and kidney when a high-energy
        compound named phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is synthesized by the
        enzyme PEPCK present in mitochondria. </p>
      <p><b>Enter Hydrazine Sulfate</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate (HS) is an inexpensive common chemical which
        is commercially available for about 11 cents per gram. HS is
        used in the refining of rare metals, in analytical blood tests,
        and as an antioxidant in soldering flux. HS is carcinogenic. It
        induces a range of in vitro genotoxic effects including DNA and
        gene damage in mammalian cells and bacteria, and chromosomal
        aberrations in mammalian cells. [4] In 1968, HS was shown to
        induce lung adenomas, adenocarcinomas and liver cell carcinomas
        in male rats. [5] HS is either genotoxic or a nongenotoxic
        carcinogen, i.e., it acts as a tumor promoter for preexisting
        initiated cells. [6] </p>
      <p>HS produces hypoglycemia in dogs and rabbits. [7] In 1966,
        Brown et al reported that HS caused genetic mutations in normal
        cells and cautioned that if it was used in animals over the long
        term, HS should he considered potentially carcinogenic. [8] </p>
      <p>Joseph Gold, MD, is a general practitioner and the director of
        the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute. Gold postulated that a
        metabolic circuit existed in cancer patients that allows energy
        needed for tumor growth to be drawn from normal metabolic
        pathways. According to Gold, lactic acid from tumor glycolysis,
        amino acids from protein breakdown and glycerol from fat
        mobilization drive gluconeogenic activity which drains away the
        energy which normal anabolic processes need to produce and
        maintain tissue integrity. This alleged "energy short circuit"
        causes cachexia in cancer. If the circuit could be broken,
        cachexia would be overcome and the cancer would he deprived of
        the energy needed to grow. [9] </p>
      <p>In 1966 P. D. Ray first published the results of his studies on
        the effect of L-tryptophane and HS on the formation of
        phosphoenolpyruvate in the gluconeogenesis in rat liver. [10]
        Later he reported effects of various hypoglycemia-inducing
        agents on carbohydrate metabolism in rats. [11] While HS did not
        react directly with PEP, it did inhibit the conversion of
        oxaloacetate to PEP, the high-energy compound considered
        essential for the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis in
        liver and kidney tissue. He found that the enzyme
        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which controlled new
        glucose formation in liver and kidney tissues was inhibited by
        HS. </p>
      <p>When Gold learned of these results, he concluded HS was the
        means to reverse cachexia. He suggested that by feeding HS to
        cancer patients one could block gluconeogenesis without blocking
        normal energy metabolism, thus overcoming cachexia and reversing
        cachexia-dependent tumor progression. </p>
      <p>In 1971 Gold reported that HS inhibited the growth of an
        experimental W-256 tumor in rats. [12] In 1973 he reported HS
        inhibited PEPCK and growth of the tumors Walker 256, B-16
        Melanoma, M-S Lymphosarcoma, and L1210 Leukemia in rats. [13] In
        1974 he studied the relationship between PEPCK inhibition and
        the ability of several known gluconeogenesis inhibitors to
        affect the growth of tumor cells in tissue culture. He reported
        that HS was not toxic for these cells. [14] In 1975 Gold
        reported that HS potentiated standard chemotherapeutic agents
        like cytoxan, mitomycin, methotrexate, and bleomycin, in rats
        and mice. [15] In 1975 he published results of an IND clinical
        trial in which he treated 84 terminal cancer patients with HS.
        The trial lasted one year and was not randomized, double
        blinded, or placebo controlled. The results were: subjective
        improvement, with three-quarters of subjects saying that they
        had better appetite, weight gain, and a general feeling of "well
        being." These effects varied widely in terms of their duration,
        lasting from a few days to several months. The cancer in 14/84
        of the patients "stabilized." (There was no mention of the
        growth of tumors in the rest of the patient group.) There were
        no significant toxic effects due to HS. No attempt was made to
        monitor the ability of the HS to influence glucose metabolism of
        the patients. There were no long-term follow up studies. [16] </p>
      <p><b>More Research</b> </p>
      <p>There followed several randomized, double blinded,
        placebo-controlled clinical trials: Ochoa et al in 1975, [17] H.
        J. Lerner, [18] S. B. Strum et al., [19] and E. Spremulli et al.
        [20] All found HS treatment to be of no value in reducing tumor
        size or in increasing patient survival time. By 1980, Regelson
        had treated 66 advanced-stage cancer patients and examined them
        for subjective and objective responses as Gold had done. [21]
        None of Regelson's patients had objective tumor responses that
        could he attributed to the HS treatment. There were brief
        subjective responses but they were no different from what could
        have been attributed to placebo effect. HS had no effect on
        survival. In 1982 Gold disputed the conclusions of Regelson and
        Ochoa, saying their conclusions were based on "politics" and
        were the result of an Establishment conspiracy to suppress a
        cheap and effective cure for cancer. [22] </p>
      <p>A group in Russia reported results supporting Gold's thesis.
        [23-25] The effects were the same subjective effects that Gold
        reported, i.e., a lessening of pain, fever, hemoptysis, and an
        increased appetite. Filov reported that HS produced a marked
        psychotropic effect in patients which occurred 23 weeks after
        the start of the HS administration. Filov described it as a
        marked "euphoria" and stated that cachectic terminal intestinal
        cancer patients were unable to recognize the reality of their
        conditions. </p>
      <p>In 1984 and 1987 R. T. Cheblowski [26,27] confirmed that both a
        decrease in glucose tolerance and an increase in the rate of
        total glucose production were seen in patients with cachexia. HS
        treatment for one month resulted in improvement in abnormal
        glucose metabolism, weight gain, and increased appetite in some
        patients. </p>
      <p>In 1990 Cheblowski examined the influence of HS on the
        nutritional status and survival in 65 patients with non-small-
        cell lung cancer. [28] The trials were randomized, double
        blinded, and placebo controlled. There was no significant
        difference between HS and placebo groups with respect to
        progress of the cancer or survival rate of the patients. The HS
        treated group did show increased appetite and some weight gain.
        Again HS seemed to induce a state of euphoria in patients which
        caused them to believe that they were being cured. Because of
        modest neurotoxicity of HS, Cheblowski felt that it would not be
        a good candidate for use in long-term treatment until
        appropriate trials for safety were run. Cheblowski concluded,
        "Considering all patients, survival was slightly greater for the
        HS treated group compared with the placebo group, but the
        differences did not achieve statistical significance." More
        studies with better trial design need to be done. </p>
      <p>In June 1994, three papers [29-31] described the effects of
        adding HS to the chemotherapeutic regimens of patients with
        advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and leukemia, advanced
        colorectal cancer, and with newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung
        cancer. All three placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical
        trials yielded results leading authors to conclude: "This study
        demonstrates that there is no benefit from the addition of HS to
        an effective cytotoxic regimen." </p>
      <p><b>A Media Assessment</b> </p>
      <p>In July 1994 Penthouse magazine carried a story by Jeff Kamen
        that proclaimed to its readership, "The Russians are benefiting
        from Dr. Gold's cancer drug, a drug our own government seems
        determined to destroy." Kamen, a freelance writer, not a medical
        research scientist, came to this conclusion after an all-expense
        paid visit to the N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in
        St. Petersburg, Russia, where Gershanovich and Filov, two
        long-time proponents of HS use in cancer, worked. The Russians
        told Kamen that they had treated 1000 cancer patients with HS
        and cured them. Since Kamen believed them, he concluded that the
        truth about HS had been suppressed in the United States by the
        NCI and FDA. </p>
      <p>In this same article, Kamen cited the testimonial of one Dr.
        Joanne Daniloff, Department of Veterinary Medicine of the
        Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. She is quoted as
        saying that after the surgical removal of most of her tumor (a
        glioblastoma multiforme Grade IV), her local physician told her
        that her cancer was incurable She took HS, and the tumor has not
        returned. Dr. Daniloff is quoted as saying, "I have read studies
        that show clear evidence of HS as a chemotherapeutic agent. HS
        alone has been shown to reduce the size of numerous tumors."
        Since Daniloff gave no references for these statements, a
        Medline search was done for the period 1980-1990. No
        publications were found that offer that evidence. A call was
        placed to the Department of Veterinary Medicine on January 2,
        1997, to personally request those references from Dr. Daniloff.
        The personnel department and the secretary of the Department of
        Veterinary Medicine both stated they had no record of such a
        person on their staff. </p>
      <p>Kamen ended his article by announcing that as a result of
        pressure from Congress, the GAO agreed to investigate the NCI's
        conduct regarding clinical trials cited above. In September
        1995, the GAO concluded that the three large randomized,
        placebo-controlled clinical trials that were sponsored by NCI
        were correctly done and that the conclusion that HS was
        ineffective in extending survival in cancer patients were also
        valid. </p>
      <p>In 1996 British medical scientists published two extensive
        reviews on the subject of cancer cachexia. [32] </p>
      <p><b>Death Reported</b> </p>
      <p>In December 2000, the Annals of Internal Medicine published a
        case report of a 55-year-old man with cancer of the sinus near
        his left cheekbone. Instead of undergoing recommended medical
        treatment, he obtained hydrazine sulfate through a Web site and,
        for four months, followed the regimen published on the
        kathykeeton.com Web site. Two weeks later, he was hospitalized
        with signs of kidney and liver failure. Despite intensive
        hospital care, he died within a week [33,34]. </p>
      <p><b>Summary and Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>My review of all the literature (including Gold's) on the
        subject of the efficacy of hydrazine sulphate shows: </p>
      <p>HS has never been shown to act as an anticancer agent <br>
        Patients do not experience remissions or regressions of their
        cancer due to HS treatment <br>
        Patients treated with HS do not live longer than nontreated
        patients. <br>
        Although HS may correct abnormal carbohydrate metabolism in some
        cancer patients, the rationale that it acts as an anticancer
        agent because it deprives cancers of their energy by inhibiting
        formation of glucose from lactic acid (gluconeogenesis) is
        erroneous. <br>
        HS has not been shown to be an effective anticancer agent. <br>
        HS is not risk-free. </p>

              Treatment</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>These Treatments are Different</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>You cannot pick an alternative cancer treatment the same way
        you pick your other medications. Despite the enthusiastic claims
        of well meaning people: </p>
      <p>* Just because an alternative cancer treatment worked for
        someone else, that does not mean it will work for you. <br>
        * Even though there are many viable alternative cancer
        treatments, there isn't a "best" treatment for a certain type or
        stage of cancer. <br>
        * Most alternative cancer treatments only work on a minority of
        the people who try it. </p>
      <p>A person's unique body chemistry seems to be the most important
        consideration in selecting an alternative cancer treatment. Only
        energy medicine offers a selection method that takes body
        chemisrty into account. </p>
      <p><b>What to Do</b> </p>
      <p>Consider taking two treatments, the treatment recommend by
        someone else or selected by your research and the treatment
        indicated by energy medicine testing using the Alternative
        Cancer Treatments Test Kit*. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>Tumors take their energy from glucose and turn it into lactic
        acid which must be broken down by the liver. Unfortunately, the
        liver converts lactic acid to glucose. This cycle is called
        cachexia and is responsible for the wasting away that is typical
        of cancer patients. Hydrazine sulfate is designed to stop this
        wasting away. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate's popularity grew rapidly after the publicity
        generated at the 1974 NHF(National Health Federation) convention
        by Dr. Joseph Gold, director of the Syracuse Cancer Research
        Institute in Syracuse, New York. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate was demonstrating good results, but it was
        getting too popular. The FDA decided to put on the brakes and
        withdrew the INDs (Investigational New Drug number). After that,
        funding dried up, and companies withdrew their interest in
        researching the drug. All of this despite the fact that the drug
        was showing good response in a number of studies. </p>
      <p><b>Development</b> </p>
      <p>In the 1960s Dr. Joseph Gold, director of the Syracuse Cancer
        Research Institute in Syracuse, New York, started looking for a
        way to stop cachexia (see Introduction ). He eventually found
        that hydrazine sulfate blocked a liver enzyme that supports
        cachexia. </p>
      <p><b>Pharmacology</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate blocks a liver enzyme that is needed for the
        liver to support cachexia, the wasting away experienced by most
        advanced cancer patients. </p>
      <p><b>Effectiveness</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate has been used for reducing pain and
        interrupting cachexia. Cachexia stops the wasting away that
        later stage cancer patients experience. Hydrazine sulfate seems
        to be effective regardless of the type of cancer. However,
        hydrazine sulfate does not seem to be effective in removing
        cancer tumors. </p>
      <p><b>Studies</b> </p>
      <p>In 1973 Dr. Joseph Gold, director of the Syracuse Cancer
        Research Institute performed an animal stuy with hydrazine
        sulfate. The results showed that it inhibited the growth of
        several different types of tumors in laboratory animals. It also
        improved the effectiveness of several chemotherapy drugs. </p>
      <p>Dr. Dean Burk, of NCI, called hydrazine sulfate "the most
        remarkable anticancer agent I have come across in my forty-five
        years of experience in cancer." He even detailed some case
        histories of successful treatments with hydrazine sulfate: </p>
      <p>Since April 1, 1973, upwards of 30 cachectic or "terminal"
        cancer patients have been treated with gelatin capsules
        containing 60 mg of hydrazine sulfate three to four times a day
        (at intervals of about 6 hours). Usually within 24-48 hours
        there is a marked return of appetite followed by continued
        increase in weight, remarkably restored physical activity, and
        eventually decrease in tumor size, decrease in pain, and related
        decrease in symptomatology. </p>
      <p>One patient, a young man with Hodgkin's disease, was bedridden
        and severely underweight. After receiving only two doses of
        hydrazine sulfate he was able to get out of bed and care for
        himself. After five days of treatment he actually left the
        hospital for a brief trip. There appeared to be no side effects
        from the low dosage of the drug employed, and one patient who
        had a previously inoperable cancer experienced sufficient tumor
        regression to be operated on. </p>
      <p><b>Another Sloan-Kettering Debacle</b> </p>
      <p>It seems that every alternative cancer treatment study that is
        performed by Sloan-Kettering is run so poorly that no
        conclusions can be made. Here is just another example: </p>
      <p>In September 1973 Dr. Gold joined a research team effort to
        evaluate hydrazine sulfate's effects. However, it turned out
        that many of the patients chosen for the study were within days
        of dying. Also, Sloan-Kettering allegedly did not follow the
        agreed dosages that were to be administered. In 1974
        Sloan-Kettering announced the results of the study, claiming
        that none of the patients had shown a positive response to
        hydrazine sulfate and that some of the patients experienced
        neurotoxic side effects. </p>
      <p><b>Positive Results</b> </p>
      <p>In the Journal Oncology, a study was published by Dr. Golden.
        This study evaluated eighty-four patients with various types of
        advanced cancer who used hydrazine sulfate. 70 percent of the
        patients reported improvements, such as increased strength,
        improved performance, decreased pain, increased appetite, weight
        gain or cessation of weight loss. Also, 17 percent experienced
        measurable improvement such as, tumor regression, disappearance
        of or decrease in cancer-associated disorders, and long-term
        condition stabilization. </p>
      <p><b>Positive Results from Russia</b> </p>
      <p>A study conducted in the Soviet Union confirmed that hydrazine
        sulfate can retard the growth of several types of cancers in
        animals. The study also contained results of forty-eight
        terminal cancer patients who were given hydrazine as a last
        resort. Out of peas 48 cases, tumor growth altered in 15
        percent, and another 20 percent experienced measurable tumor
        regression; 58 percent of the patients reported subjective
        improvements, such as reduction of pain, and increased appetite.
      </p>
      <p><b>A Large Published Study</b> </p>
      <p>A large-scale study of hydrazine sulfate was run in 1979 in
        Russia under the supervision of a Dr. Michael Gershanovich. The
        study ran for four years and included 225 patients. The results
        of the study was published. Summarizing the results make it
        clear that hydrazine sulfate was effective in reversing cachexia
        and producing disease stabilization in late-stage cancer
        patients. <br>
        A Larger Study </p>
      <p>A larger, Soviet study demonstrated the effectiveness of
        hydrazine sulfate in 740 cancer patients most of whom had used
        conventional treatments without success. The types of cancer
        broke down as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;200 lung cancer <br>
        &nbsp;138 cancer of the stomach <br>
        &nbsp;66 breast cancer <br>
        &nbsp;63 Hodgkin's disease <br>
        &nbsp;31 melanoma </p>
      <p>After two to three weeks of therapy, tumor stabilization or
        regression occurred in 50.8 percent of the patients, 46.6
        percent of the patients had improvements, such as decrease in
        fever, reduced respiratory problems, and disappearance of edema.
        Other results included, improved appetite and strength, and
        decrease or elimination of pain. </p>
      <p><b>Fraudulent NCI Testing</b> </p>
      <p>Daniel Haley's brilliant book, Politics in Healing, tells how
        NCI's 1991 clinical trial of the alternative cancer treatment,
        hydrazine sulfate (HS), was rigged to fail. </p>
      <p>A spectacularly promising medicine, HS had shown good results
        in trials at Harbor/UCLA hospital and in Russia. NCI felt
        obligated to test the drug. But there was a catch. </p>
      <p>The drug's discoverer, Dr. Joseph Gold, had found that HS
        reacted badly if patients were taking other drugs, especially
        tranquilizers. Several warnings were given to NCI before it
        began its test. The warnings were explicit. Patients could DIE
        if they were taking tranquilizers. </p>
      <p>It turned out that none of the NCI patients were warned about
        this. It turned out that 94% of those patients were in fact on
        tranquilizers. Barry Tice, an investigator for the US General
        Accounting Office (GAO), looked into the NCI trial of hydrazine
        sulfate after it was over. He called Dr. Gold and told him he
        had found a "smoking gun." There was an internal NCI memo which
        showed that NCI was well aware of the problems involved in the
        drug combinations. The GAO did not back up its own investigator.
        The final GAO report on the NCI clinical trials of hydrazine
        sulfate simply accused NCI of sloppy bookkeeping. </p>
      <p>In the June 1995 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, a
        letter from the NCI was published. The letter stated that NCI
        had omitted mentioning, in its own published account of its
        cancer study, that 94% of the patients had been on
        tranquilizers. But, because this letter did NOT mention how
        dangerous that situation was, it looked like NCI was simply
        admitting to a technical and unimportant mistake. A clerical
        error. </p>
      <p>So what did happen to the patients in the NCI hydrazine sulfate
        study? </p>
      <p>They ALL DIED. </p>
      <p><b>http://alternativecancer.us/hydrazinesulfate.htm</b> </p>
      <p><b>Conclusiveness of Papers</b> </p>
      <p>The conclusions of the majority of research papers written
        about hiders and sulfate shows that it has positive effects for
        treating cancer and most especially for reducing pain and weight
        loss. See studies above. <br>
        Standalone Ability </p>
      <p>Cachexia and is responsible for the wasting away that is
        typical of cancer patients. Hydrazine sulfate is designed to
        stop this wasting away it was not intended as a primary tumor
        biting treatment. However, since there do not seem to be any
        compatibility issues, hydrazine sulfate seems like a good
        candidate as an auxiliary treatment especially when the patient
        is losing weight and in pain. </p>
      <p><b>Ease of Use and Dosage</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate only needs to be taken three times a day in a
        small 60 mg pill. Persons weighing less than 125 lbs. have often
        been advised to switch to a 30 mg pill. </p>
      <p>See the "Hydrazine Sulfate Is an MAOI Avoid These Foods"
        subsection under Side Effects for a list of foods whose intake
        you may want to reduce. </p>
      <p>People who change their eating habits greatly increase the
        effectiveness of the supplements they take. Consider reading the
        "General Diet*" subsection of the Home page. </p>
      <p><b>Side Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Although hydrazine sulfate is generally considered nontoxic
        there are some potential side effects that usually only occur at
        high doses. These side effects include: dizziness, drowsiness,
        mild numbness (particularly of the fingers and toes), nausea and
        mild sensations of itching of the skin. There is actually a
        positive side effect, hydrazine sulfate often produces a mild
        euphoria after two to three weeks of use. Polyneuritis (nerve
        inflammation) sometimes occurs in cases of prolonged and
        continuous treatment. Dr. Gold stated that vitamin B6 can
        alleviate this problem. Taking Hydrazine sulfate and
        tranquilizers during the same time can be fatal. </p>
      <p><b>Hydrazine Sulfate Is a MAOI Avoid These Foods</b> </p>
      <p>Hydrazine Sulfate inhibits an enzyme that breaks down
        monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine). These are
        chemicals used by our brain and effect our mood. MAO inhibitors
        metabolize tyramine, an amino acid. When taking an MAO
        inhibitor, tyramine is not broken down, and eating foods with
        tyramine can raise blood pressure and heart beat and cause
        headaches. Most of the foods containing tayramine are not very
        healthy so it is good to be avoiding them anyway. </p>
      <p>Foods containing tyramine are mostly aged, fermented, or
        pickled, such as most cheeses (except cottage cheese, cream
        cheese, and fresh Mozzerlla), lunch meats, hot dogs, yogurt,
        wines and beers. A more complete list of foods that contain
        tyramine: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dry and fermented sausage (bologna, salami,
        pepperoni, corned beef, and liver), pickled herring and salted
        dried fish, broad beans and pods (lima, fava beans, lentils,
        snow peas, and soy beans), meat extracts, yeast
        extracts/brewer's yeast, beer and ale, red wine (chianti,
        burgundy, sherry, vermouth), sauerkraut, some fruits (bananas,
        avacados, canned figs, raisins, red plums, raspberries,
        pinapples), cultured dairy products (buttermilk, yogurt, and
        sour cream), chocolate, caffeine (coffee, tea, and cola drinks),
        white wine, port wines, distilled spirits, soy sauce, miso,
        peanuts, almonds, beef or chicken liver, herring, meat
        tenderizer, MSG (Accent), pickles, and pumpkin seeds. </p>
      <p>People avoiding tyramine, reduce their intake of high protein
        food that have undergone aging and over-the-counter cold or
        allergy remedy. <br>
        Compatibility </p>
      <p>There are not any known compatibility issues with hydrazine
        sulfate and other cancer treatments or supplements. However,
        taking hydrogen sulfate while taking tranquilizers, can have
        fatal complications. </p>
      <p><b>Year Available</b> </p>
      <p>.Hydrazine sulfate became popular in the 1970s <br>
        Relative Cost per Month </p>
      <p>One hundred 60 mg pills, enough for one month, costs about $30.
      </p>
      <p><b>Testimonials and Belief</b> </p>
      <p>Testimonials can be a very powerful tool to help in the healing
        process because they can boost your belief in a treatment.
        However, reading testimonies is a poor method of making a
        treatment selection. An alternative cancer treatment with only a
        5% success rate can still obtain many genuine and impressive
        testimonials. A selected group of positive testimonials cannot
        compare to a published study were all of the qualified case
        histories are presented, the failures as well as the successes.
      </p>
      <p>For the above reason, it is not a good idea to use testimonials
        to help you select a cancer treatment. Save testimonials for the
        role that they perform the best, bolstering belief after
        treatments have been selected. Using an Alternative Cancer
        Treatment Test kit is a much better method of making the
        treatment decision. </p>

        <p><b>THE TRUTH ABOUT HYDRAZINE SULFATE - DR. GOLD SPEAKS</b> </p>
        <p><b>Dr. Joseph Gold, M.D.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>For some time now I have refrained from making any comments in
        regard to information on the Internet concerning hydrazine
        sulfate. My silence has been occasioned by the hope that our
        federal and prominent private-sector cancer agencies would
        endorse the use of hydrazine sulfate, in the wake of clinical
        trials demonstrating its effectiveness in the treatment of
        cancer. </p>
      <p>But this hasn't happened. Quite the opposite. A casual
        examination of the Internet shows that information in regard to
        hydrazine sulfate is composed of a mixture of “endorsements” of
        hydrazine sulfate from individual patients and their
        advocates—and the seemingly authoritative disparagement of it by
        cancer establishment sources. It is this “condemnation” of
        hydrazine sulfate I wish to address—the scientific gobbledygook
        of so-called studies, side effects, carcinogenicity, toxicity,
        cautions, critiques and inferences woven together by our cancer
        agencies' most talented “spin doctors” into a web of outright
        misrepresentations, deception and scientific fraud. (As an
        example of this fraud, NCI has posted an entry on the Internet,
        “date last modified: 6/18/04,” stating “hydrazine sulfate has
        shown no anticancer activity in randomized clinical trials,”
        which as will be seen is patently untrue and does not reflect
        the ten years of randomized clinical trials performed by
        Harbor-UCLA Medical Center from 1981-1990 and the many
        published, peer-reviewed clinical studies based on that body of
        work.) </p>
      <p>The purpose of this statement is to guide you, step by step,
        through the scientific development of hydrazine sulfate as an
        anticancer agent, the clinical trials—and the high-level
        negative politics which came to surround this drug from the very
        beginning. It will be plainly seen that the cautions against
        this drug presented on the Internet by our highest federal
        health agencies are but an assemblage of misinformation and
        disinformation which acts to discourage this drug's use both by
        individual patients as well as by well-meaning physicians. </p>
      <p>First and foremost, it is important for you to know that,
        contrary to implications made on the Internet, clinical trials
        of hydrazine sulfate have been done and published in
        peer-reviewed medical journals which circulate worldwide. And
        the truth is that every single, informed-consent, controlled
        clinical trial of hydrazine sulfate, performed in accordance
        with internationally accepted criteria and standards of
        scientific conduct—without exception—has indicated efficacy and
        safety of the drug. The only contrary results have been the
        National Cancer Institute-sponsored trials of hydrazine sulfate
        in which incompatible agents (medications) were used with the
        test drug. It must be stressed that no legitimate researcher on
        this planet would ever knowingly use an incompatible agent—or
        one even suspected of incompatibility—in the trial of a test
        drug. Use of an incompatible agent in a drug test, which acts to
        cause a negative study, can only be the result of incompetence
        or deliberateness. </p>
      <p>Secondly, Internet sources have implicated hydrazine sulfate to
        be toxic or carcinogenic. Although hydrazine sulfate is
        carcinogenic—i.e., can cause cancer—in some weanling mice given
        the drug in their drinking water since birth, there has never
        been a case of human cancer reported as a result of HS therapy .
        (In contrast, routinely administered chemotherapy drugs are
        commonly carcinogenic—and can produce up to 26% of “second
        cancers.”) Perhaps more importantly, the influential medical
        journal Annals of Internal Medicine presented a “Brief
        Communication” (and accompanying editorial) in its December 5,
        2000 issue, of a single patient who allegedly died of fatal
        hepatorenal failure as a result of “HS” therapy. The only
        trouble was that no firm evidence was presented in this paper
        that the patient in question ever took hydrazine sulfate. The
        authors of this article stated: “We could not obtain samples of
        the product he [the patient] ingested.” This means there was no
        possibility of a direct examination of what it was the patient
        was taking. The authors further stated: “His blood was not
        tested for the presence of hydrazine.” But there are simple
        spectrofluorometric blood tests that will confirm even the
        smallest residues of hydrazine sulfate ingested even months
        earlier. It must be emphasized that no medical journal on
        earth—of high repute or not—would publish an article and
        editorial based on one case, calling attention of the medical
        profession and public to the potential toxicity of a drug
        gaining in common usage, without incontrovertible, verifiable,
        air-tight evidence that the patient in question ever took the
        drug in the first place. No journal would have the ethical
        recklessness to disseminate an article having far-reaching
        public health consequences, without absolute proof of its basic
        assumptions. But the editors and writers of the Annals—with our
        federal health agencies' knowledge and participation—chose to
        disseminate their reports to the media of the world, to the
        medical profession of every country and to the Internet, where
        the public would be sure to find them. To put this situation in
        its proper context: While Annals chose to issue a “drug warning”
        based on one, single presumptive case of fatal toxicity of HS in
        the 30 years since the drug has been in use, there are tens of
        thousands of authenticated chemotherapy deaths each year . Has
        the Annals, or other medical journals, or our federal health
        agencies, or the prominent private-sector cancer organizations
        ever let the public know this? </p>
      <p>Your life or the life of a loved one or friend may depend on
        your reading, and understanding, the statement below. References
        are used in support of the events, happenings and details of
        this expanded statement. </p>
      <p><b>Scientific Background.</b> Hydrazine sulfate (HS), an
        inexpensive, mass-produced chemical compound used for many
        industrial applications, was first proposed as an anticachexia
        agent based on its inhibition of the gluconeogenic enzyme,
        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP CK).1,2 It was further
        proposed that if tumor energy (ATP) gain and host energy loss
        (resulting from cancer-induced excessive gluconeogenesis) were
        functionally interrelated—as seemed probable—HS could also, by
        indirect and non-toxic means, inhibit tumor growth itself.3
        Early in-vivo studies demonstrated that HS could inhibit weight
        loss (cachexia) and tumor growth in a variety of transplanted
        mouse and rat models, without direct cytotoxicity,2-6 could add
        to the antitumor effects of chemotherapy drugs,7-9 and was free
        of significant side effects.10 These results strongly suggested
        HS as a new means of non-toxic cancer chemotherapy.11,12 </p>
      <p><b>Adverse Politics Begin.</b> Despite this drug's early
        promise, from the very beginning of clinical trials, HS was to
        be met with controversy as a function of government action. On
        March 8, 1976, veteran congressman James M. Hanley (Chair of the
        Post Office and Civil Service Committee and a member of many
        committees and subcommittees) requested a “status report” on HS
        from the director of the National Cancer Institute, our
        country's—and the world's—largest and most influential cancer
        agency. Within two weeks he received a reply which stated:
        “Hydrazine sulfate has been tested in the Soviet Union at the
        Petrov Institute in Leningrad [St. Petersburg ]. In a clinical
        study directed by Dr. Michael Gershanovich, no evidence of
        meaningful anticancer activity was reported. This information
        was communicated to the NCI under the Joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Health
        Agreement of 1972.”13,14 Days later, however, reprints of the
        actual study became available. Its English summary stated:
        “Clinical observations enabled us to state a definite
        therapeutic effect of hydrazine sulfate in patients with
        lymphogranulomatosis [Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas] and
        malignant tumors of various localizations, when other measures
        of specific therapy failed.”15 </p>
      <p>This was exactly opposite of what was communicated to
        Congressman Hanley. In fact, the text stated that because of the
        highly positive findings the study was being immediately
        enlarged. As to whether the NCI response to Congressman Hanley
        represented an innocent error on the part of the NCI or a
        deliberate fabrication, a further letter from the NCI, dated
        June 22, 1976, stated: “An abstract [summary] of the
        Gershanovich study appeared in Cancer Therapy Abstracts (Vol.
        16: No. 4 [19]75-2046), a journal published under contract to
        the NCI.”16 This published abstract antedated the NCI's response
        to Congressman Hanley by six months. Thus, at the time the NCI
        was writing to Congressman Hanley that the Soviet data were
        negative, the NCI already knew these data were positive. </p>
      <p><b>Early Clinical Studies</b>. In 1975 three articles would
        appear in the medical literature, detailing initial clinical
        results with hydrazine sulfate. The first, the Soviet study,15 a
        phase II controlled clinical trial, set forth astonishing
        results in a class of patients termed “factually terminal [stage
        4],” who had become unresponsive, or had failed to respond
        initially, to conventional therapy: 58 percent demonstrated
        anticachexia response (weight gain, performance status
        improvement, normalization of the laboratory indices, etc.), and
        35 percent showed antitumor response (tumor regression or
        stabilization); one year later the initial series of 48 patients
        was enlarged to 95 patients, with essentially the same
        results.17 The second, a pharmaceutical-sponsored IND
        (Investigational New Drug) study of 84 terminal and preterminal
        patients with different types of cancer demonstrated a 59
        percent anticachexia response and a 17 percent antitumor
        response.18 The third, a small study of 29 patients conducted at
        Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, totally uncontrolled for
        patient selection, drug dosage and treatment schedule, and prior
        and concurrent therapy, found no long-term improvements
        (although transient response was recorded).19 On the basis of
        this totally uncontrolled MSKCC trial of 29 patients the
        American Cancer Society, in March 1976, placed HS on its
        “Unproven Methods” list.20 The ACS stated: “After careful study
        of the literature and other available information, the American
        Cancer Society does not have evidence that Hydrazine Sulfate is
        of any objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human
        beings.” In its article, the ACS referenced only the
        uncontrolled MSKCC study, but failed to reference the phase II
        controlled Soviet trial or the (American)
        pharmaceutical-sponsored IND study. (In late 1979 the ACS
        removed HS from its Unproven Methods list, in the wake of
        increasingly positive data on HS.21) </p>
      <p>In March 1979 the Soviet study was enlarged to 225 patients.
        Published as an abstract in the March 1979 Proceedings of the
        American Association for Cancer Research, controlled for patient
        selection and prognosis, performance status, dosage protocol,
        prior and concurrent therapy, the study reported overall results
        of 65 percent anticachexia response and 44 percent antitumor
        response. Anticachexia response was described as “appreciable
        improvement of appetite and general status, disappearance or
        reduction of severe weakness characteristic of the pretreatment
        period, reduction or complete elimination of pain, tendency
        toward normalization of the laboratory findings”; antitumor
        response included tumor regression (“less than 25 to greater
        than 50% of initial tumor volume”) and tumor stabilization (from
        “3-6 months”); side effects included “minimal nausea, dizziness,
        anorexia, polyneuritis (1.7%) [tingling of the fingers]”—and the
        absence of bone marrow depression (“leukopenia and
        thrombocytopenia were not observed”). In this class of patients
        no efficacy and safety findings approaching these had ever
        before been reported. Nevertheless, although arrangements had
        been made through the Soviet and American governments to have
        Dr. Gershanovich come to this country to discuss these results,
        after traveling more than 7,000 miles he was not permitted to
        present his paper orally at the annual scientific meetings of
        the American Association for Cancer Research in New Orleans .
        Asked by the media at this conference whether “consideration
        should not have been given to the fact that [this] Russian trial
        was the first large-scale study of [HS], purporting to show
        significant benefits from its use”—and therefore become subject
        to open discussion by the world oncology community—the program
        chairman of the AACR stated: “The Gershanovich paper is not
        going to be presented, and that's it.”22 (In 1981 the
        Gershanovich data were published as a full-length paper in the
        American peer-reviewed journal, Nutrition and Cancer.23) </p>
      <p>Also in 1979 a negative paper on HS of 25 non-randomized,
        non-blinded, non-controlled, open-study patients would be
        published in the journal Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology,24
        whose editor-in-chief was an NCI official, authored by Dr.
        William Regelson (now deceased) and colleagues from the Medical
        College of Virginia. In this totally unaudited study, 7 of the
        “negative” patients died (of their disease, not from the drug)
        within 11 days of starting HS therapy (1 died on the very first
        day), another was “lost to follow-up” after two weeks, 2 others
        received prior chemotherapy which had not yet cleared, 1
        received concurrent medication shown to be incompatible with HS
        as long as four years previously,8,15,25 and 16 received HS less
        than the required four-week minimum (l patient received HS for
        only 1 day, 9 for 1 week or less, 16 for 2 weeks or less). Of
        the 25 “negative” patients only five could qualify for
        evaluation according to established drug-testing protocol.
        Because only 20 percent of the patients of the study were
        evaluable, it is unclear how this paper achieved publication,
        since it was apparent that it could not have been subject to
        normal, independent peer-review procedures. </p>
      <p><b>The American Medical Association Enters The Fray.</b> In
        January 1980 the Commentary section of the Journal of the
        American Medical Association26 would present another negative
        article on HS, again authored by Dr. Regelson. The JAMA was at
        the time perhaps the most authoritative medical journal in the
        world and its prestigious Commentary section, located at the
        beginning of many issues, was in effect a forum that usually
        addressed an important social or political medical problem or
        question—and was thus a reflection of the views of organized
        medicine at its highest levels. In this Commentary article Dr.
        Regelson stated that he and “others” had performed randomized,
        double-blind studies on HS that were negative. (“In both
        randomized double-blind and nonrandomized studies, our group and
        others have tested hydrazine sulfate in advanced cancer
        patients….”) But the truth was that Dr. Regelson—or “others”—
        never performed any double-blind studies and indeed the only
        study that Dr. Regelson ever performed was the one, previously
        discussed, in which 80 percent of the patients were unevaluable
        and which could not have been published on the basis of
        independent peer-review. In fact Dr. Regelson never once
        mentioned the Gershanovich results—the only truly controlled
        (phase II) clinical trial of HS up to that time (1979), which
        dwarfed all other studies (225/233 evaluable patients) of HS
        combined. (Gershanovich's name did not appear once in the text.)
        Of HS Dr. Regelson only stated: “[Hydrazine sulfate] does
        inhibit the Walker 256 carcinoma [a rat tumor] and has shown
        synergy with chemotherapy in the L 1210 in mice….Where does that
        leave us?” Thus extolling the “double-blind” studies he had
        never published or performed, and omitting any mention of the
        large-scale, positive, controlled Russian trials that had been
        published and performed—Dr. Regelson's Commentary article sent
        an unmistakable message that HS was tantamount to quackery
        medicine, in effect regarded by the cancer establishment (he
        referred to himself as “we members of the Establishment”) as a
        pharmaceutica-non-grata . Equally disconcerting was the fact
        that the editorial staff of the JAMA had apparently not checked
        to ascertain that Dr. Regelson—or “others”—had indeed published
        double-blind studies on HS, in effect that what Dr. Regelson was
        writing was in fact true. JAMA 's failure to perform this most
        elementary task served only to reinforce Dr. Regelson's
        egregiously erroneous “message” to the practitioners of American
        medicine. </p>
      <p><b>Randomized Clinical Trials</b>. In 1981 the American Cancer
        Society began sponsorship of prospectively randomized,
        double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of HS at
        Harbor-UCLA Medical Center under the distinguished leadership of
        well known cancer investigators Drs. Jerome B. Block and Rowan
        T. Chlebowski. (RCTs are considered the “gold standard” of
        clinical testing, since they tend to minimize bias from all
        sources.) In February 1984 these investigators reported27 in the
        respected journal Cancer Research that in a series of 38
        patients with widespread lung, colon, breast, throat and other
        cancers, HS reversed abnormal carbohydrate metabolism associated
        with cancer cachexia. This represented a watershed work, in that
        for the first time it was demonstrated (under double-blind,
        placebo-controlled circumstances) that alteration of abnormal
        host metabolism could result in measurable clinical benefits,
        including weight improvement and stabilization, potentially
        opening the door to a new type of cancer therapy. </p>
      <p>Thus by the middle 1980s dual scientific horizons—the Soviets
        and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center—had emerged, independently
        corroborating one-another's clinical results on HS, the strong
        preponderance of data indicating this drug to represent a
        promising new therapeutic agent. </p>
      <p><b>Politics Deepen </b>. First published in the early 1980s,
        one of the most influential cancer textbooks in the world was
        (and still is) CANCER, Principles &amp; Practice of Oncology,
        whose principal editor was Dr. Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., then
        director of the NCI. In its first edition in 1983 this textbook
        carried a chapter, “Unproven Methods of Cancer Treatment,”
        authored by Dr. Jane E. Henney, deputy director of the NCI (who
        would become Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in
        1998). As expected, Dr. Henney's chapter would not include HS,
        since this drug had been removed from the American Cancer
        Society's Unproven List three years previously and the Soviet
        phase II study of 225 patients had already been published in
        1981 in the American peer-reviewed journal, Nutrition and
        Cancer.23 But in this textbook's second edition, published in
        1985,28 in the wake of further positive clinical studies, Dr.
        Henney's chapter, strangely enough, did include HS. By that time
        the Russian (Soviet) series had been enlarged to 356 patients,29
        reporting essentially the same highly positive results as in
        earlier papers, again in very late stage, refractory patients.
        In her chapter, Dr. Henney characterized these Soviet results—in
        this instance 44 percent antitumor response and 50 percent
        anticachexia response, previously unheard of in this class of
        patients—as merely showing “hints of subjective activity.” And
        although the watershed February 1984 Cancer Research Harbor-UCLA
        article—and its predecessor ASCO abstracts of 198230 and 198331
        —were available to her before the chapter went to press (in her
        chapter Dr. Henney quoted a reference dated April 1984), no
        mention whatsoever was made of the Harbor-UCLA work. </p>
      <p>In subsequent editions of the DeVita textbook Dr. Henney's
        chapter was entirely removed. Nevertheless, a signal was sent to
        the oncology world that the two highest officials of the
        NCI—Drs. DeVita and Henney—had seen fit to characterize HS as an
        “unproven method” at a time when positive data, including
        randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, were
        emergent from unimpeachable clinical sources. </p>
      <p><b>Harbor-UCLA Grant Application To The NCI </b>. On July 1,
        1983 Harbor-UCLA, under the principal investigatorship of Rowan
        T. Chlebowski, M.D., Ph.D., considered one of this country's
        leading authorities in intermediary cancer metabolism, submitted
        a grant application to the NCI to continue its successful,
        initial studies with HS and extend this salient work with the
        performance of an all-important clinical outcome study. Over the
        next few years NCI action would prove disconcerting to the
        Harbor-UCLA investigators. When Chlebowski and his colleagues
        made changes in the application recommended by the NCI study
        section, NCI referred the revised grant application to new and
        sequentially different study sections, which knew less and less
        about it and would demand further changes, until action by a
        third study section—submission to three, successive study
        sections had never before happened to any NCI grant
        application—would demand changes that had nothing to do with the
        original grant application or with changes recommended by the
        first, and primary, study section. In 1985 Dr. Chlebowski
        received notice from the NCI that his grant application had been
        approved but achieved only a “borderline” funding score,
        indicating a substantial uncertainty it would be funded.
        Chlebowski therefore sent an urgent letter to the NCI,32
        requesting “special funding consideration.” </p>
      <p>In his letter Dr. Chlebowski, stated: “Our cumulative data are
        largely in agreement with the over 300 patient Russian
        experience where clinical benefit was observed in approximately
        half the patients receiving hydrazine sulfate therapy.”
        Emphasizing the importance of his research, he stated: “If the
        negative prognostic implications of weight loss in these cancer
        patient populations could be overcome by hydrazine
        sulfate—[which he termed “representative of an entirely new
        class of therapeutic compounds”]—a major therapeutic advance
        applicable to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients would be
        achieved.” </p>
      <p>Chlebowski received no reply to his letter in over a month. A
        copy of his letter was then forwarded to the direct attention of
        Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services, for an
        “unbiased review of the hydrazine sulfate situation and of
        Dr.Chlebowski's letter in particular.”33 Two months later Dr.
        Chlebowski received a “Notice of Grant Award” from the NCI for
        his three-year project, “Glucose Metabolism and Hydrazine in
        Cancer Cachexia,” to begin September 1, 1985. </p>
      <p>In 1987 three papers were published as a result of this new
        (and residual ACS) funding. In February34 Chlebowski and
        colleagues would demonstrate, in a full-length paper, that
        weight maintenance in HS-treated patients was statistically
        associated with an increase in the effectiveness of calories
        ingested, that the mean blood circulatory levels of HS nine
        hours following a standard oral dose (60 mg) ranged from 0 to 89
        ng/ml—average: 45± 16 ng/ml—implying that patients who received
        no benefit from HS may not be absorbing it from their
        gastrointestinal tracts (i.e., patients with near-zero blood
        levels), that side effects were minimal, consisting of low
        levels of nausea, lightheadedness and “less than 1%” peripheral
        neuritis. In August35 Harbor-UCLA investigators, again in a
        full-length paper, demonstrated that HS reduced protein
        breakdown and preserved peripheral (body) muscle mass in
        patients with late stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); it
        was also found that HS acted to maintain serum albumin levels ,
        an important prognosticator of survival in these patients. </p>
      <p>However, in 1987,36 it would be a third paper published only in
        abstract form by the Harbor-UCLA investigators which would prove
        to be most consequential. In this abstract (and in an oral
        presentation at the annual scientific meetings of the American
        Society of Clinical Oncology that year) substantive evidence was
        presented that HS resulted in statistically increased survival
        in a subset of early patients with NSCLC, which had never before
        been reported as a result of drug therapy: HS addition to
        standard chemotherapy resulted in a median survival time of 328
        days, vs. placebo addition to standard chemotherapy which
        resulted in a median survival time of 209 days, the difference
        being statistically significant to the p&lt;.05 level. It was
        the first time that a treatment directed primarily at abnormal
        host metabolism was demonstrated to favorably influence survival
        outcome in patients with malignant disease. </p>
      <p>By the beginning of 1988, prospectively randomized,
        double-blind, placebo-controlled studies had thus indicated that
        HS: (a) normalized abnormal glucose metabolism, (b) resulted in
        increased effectiveness of ingested calories, (c) caused weight
        gain or weight stabilization, (d) reversed protein breakdown and
        muscle wasting, (e) maintained serum albumin levels, and (f)
        resulted in statistically significant survival increase in lung
        cancer patients. However, that same year NCI's Dr. DeVita,
        representing this country's cancer leadership at its highest
        levels, would pronounce HS a “ho-hum idea,” referring to this
        drug as merely “a therapy that gave you plumper people by the
        time they died”37 (and reaffirming his statement made to the
        media in 198l: “We throw away drugs that are better than
        hydrazine sulfate”38). </p>
      <p><b>Multi-Institutional Grant Application to the NCI</b>.
        Recognizing the large therapeutic potential of HS as a result of
        their metabolic and clinical outcome studies, Harbor-UCLA
        investigators undertook to enlarge their work from a
        single-institutional study to a multicentric study and from
        examination of a single tumor type, namely lung, to three tumor
        types: lung, breast and colon. The institutions involved would
        be: Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (study headquarters), Emory
        University Medical Center, University of Toronto Cancer Center,
        Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and M. D. Anderson
        Hospital and Tumor Institute. Among the co-principal
        investigators were some of the most distinguished names in
        cancer medicine and research: Dr. Dan Nixon, Dr. Murray Brennan,
        Dr. G. G. Boyd, and others. Dr. Chlebowski, a most
        experienced—and successful—grant writer, undertook to write the
        initial draft of the multi-institutional grant application, then
        sent it to his colleagues at the cooperating institutions for
        their comments, then revised it according to their
        recommendations. At about the time of publication of the
        Harbor-UCLA outcome study abstract (1987), Chlebowski sent the
        completed multicentric grant application to the NCI. Chlebowski,
        considered a “luminary” in the field of cancer metabolism
        investigation (he was one of thirteen scientists selected by the
        U.S. government to help establish a cancer treatment and
        teaching center in Taipei, Taiwan39 ), was shocked some months
        later to receive notification from the NCI that his grant
        application was not only not approved, but received one of the
        worst scores possible (at the time a perfect score was ‘1,” the
        worst “500”: the number given to his application was 460). In
        giving Chlebowski's multicentric application—written in
        conjunction with some of the country's top research institutes
        and scientists — such a resoundingly high (poor) score, the NCI
        in effect gave indication of its apparent displeasure with
        further, independent trials of HS. Shortly thereafter, NCI — the
        frequent and assertive adversary of HS since 1976 — assumed sole
        control of all further clinical testing of this agent. </p>
      <p><b>Hired-Gun Editorial.</b> But the Harbor-UCLA investigators,
        and HS, would be dealt another surprise at the hands of the
        cancer establishment. In early 1988, after gathering and
        collating all the data from its outcome study, Harbor-UCLA
        sought to publish a full-length paper on this study, detailing
        all study parameters—including patient selection, concurrent
        medication, treatment protocols, methods of study conduct,
        statistical analyses, etc.—in a journal of unquestioned
        reputation. Anticipating no difficulty in this task, Chlebowski
        and his co-workers sent this paper off to a mainstream, well
        regarded, internationally circulated cancer journal, in which
        they had published many times previously. This journal's
        editorial board kept his paper for four months—instead of the
        usual six weeks—and then rejected it. He then submitted the
        paper to the Journal of Clinical Oncology —a journal of the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology —considered by many as the
        emergent, authoritative journal for clinical studies of cancer
        drugs. In early 1989 the JCO agreed to publish the Harbor-UCLA
        paper, with “major revisions,” most of which related to
        methodology and details of statistical analyses. However, each
        time Harbor-UCLA submitted its revisions, the JCO would ask for
        further changes. Finally, in June 1989 Harbor-UCLA received
        final acceptance by the JCO, stating its paper would be
        published in the journal's January 1990 issue. </p>
      <p>But it would not be a “normal” publication. Ordinarily a
        journal submits to the author(s) galley proofs (page proofs) of
        the paper shortly before publication. These proofs are strictly
        of the author(s)' article and are for the express purpose of
        making last minute changes, additions or corrections. No galleys
        or proofs of any other articles or content appearing in the
        journal issue are ever sent to the author(s)—which would be
        considered highly unethical. But when Chlebowski and his group
        received galleys of their article, included in these galleys
        were the galleys of yet another paper—an editorial, “Hazards of
        Small Clinical Trials,” taking aim exclusively at the Chlebowski
        paper and the conclusions reached. Up to this time no journal
        had ever sought to attack its own lead article. Confronted with
        the choice of withdrawing their paper with the understanding
        that the editorial, too, would be withdrawn,40 Chlebowski and
        his group chose rather to go ahead with publication. </p>
      <p>Although in the January 1990 issue of the JCO Chlebowski and
        his group were able to demonstrate unequivocally that HS
        addition to chemotherapy significantly extended the lives of
        NSCLC patients,41 the effect of the editorial (which preceded
        the Chlebowski paper)42 was devastating. Written by Dr. Steven
        Piantadosi of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center (who at the time
        was also a member of FDA's Oncology Drug Advisory Committee
        which recommended to the FDA which cancer drugs to approve and
        which not to approve), the editorial singled out only the HS
        results, shredding the Harbor-UCLA work on the basis that it was
        “too small” a clinical study to be valid. However—and as pointed
        out in a subsequent issue of the JCO43—the Chlebowski trial was
        comprised of 65 patients, considered adequate for any phase III
        single-institution trial, whereas in the same journal issue
        there were trials of 15, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 40, 40, 43, 49, and
        51 patients, and the editorial took issue with none of these or
        the conclusions reached. The effect of this “hired-gun”
        editorial was to dramatically curtail the use of HS in the U.S.,
        and cast a pall over future, independent clinical research with
        HS, discouraging individual researchers and their sponsoring
        institutions from implementing any such undertakings. </p>
      <p>(In contrast, in 1990—the same year as the Piantadosi
        editorial—HS, following approval for use throughout the Soviet
        Union, was named Sehydrin by the nomenclature commission of the
        U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health and, one year later, approved by the
        Pharmacology Committee of the Ministry of Health of Russia [the
        equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration] for general
        oncology use.) </p>
      <p><b>The NCI-Sponsored Studies</b>. In 1988 the NCI announced it
        would sponsor three large-scale multicentric
        (multi-institutional) phase III studies of HS, the first (and
        largest) of which would be conducted under the auspices of the
        Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Cooperative Oncology Group
        of the NCI, headquartered at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla .
        The second and third were conducted by the North Central Cancer
        Treatment Group (NCCTG) headquartered at the Mayo Clinic. NCI's
        Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), headed by Dr. Michael
        Friedman, held the portfolio of the planned HS studies. </p>
      <p>HS is an irreversible and potent MAO (monoamine oxidase)
        inhibitor, a class of compounds that can have potentially deadly
        interactions with other drugs. For over three decades it has
        been known that central nervous system depressants—such as
        barbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol—are incompatible with
        MAO inhibitors and use of the two together could result in
        extremely dangerous effects.44 Because these agents—especially
        tranquilizers—were commonly used as supportive agents in cancer
        patients, CTEP and all study chairs of the planned NCI-sponsored
        studies were alerted that use of HS in conjunction with these
        agents would constitute a clinical hazard,45-47 were advised
        that these supportive agents should be excluded in any study of
        HS (if not, a negative study would result), and were provided
        published and unpublished data8,15,26,48,49 indicating
        deleterious interactions between the two. (For example, one of
        the provided studies indicated that tumor bearing rats given
        either a benzodiazepine tranquilizer or HS suffered no harmful
        effects, whereas when the two types of compounds were given
        together in the same doses, the rats became comatose and a 50%
        to 60% mortality resulted, depending on which benzodiazepine was
        given.) CALGB's reply was that after careful review and
        discussion, “barbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol will not be
        specifically excluded.”50 </p>
      <p>In the June 1994 issue of the JCO, the three NCI-sponsored
        studies were reported as negative.5l-53 Publication of these
        studies was apparently carefully planned, since they appeared
        consecutively —even though they were finished at far different
        intervals (February 1991, October l992, November 1992). The
        first (CALGB) study was finished a year and a half before the
        last studies—and held until the last studies were completed, the
        effect of which was that their simultaneous—and sequential
        —publication might have greater impact. In the largest of these
        studies it was emphasized that “no patients received
        barbiturates and virtually no patients received
        phenothiazine-type tranquilizers with the exception of
        prochlorperazine (Compazine), which was used as a short-term
        anti-emetic [anti-nausea] agent.” No mention was made of use of
        the more powerful benzodiazepine tranquilizers, the implication
        being that the benzodiazepine tranquilizers were not used.
        Tranquilizers were thus indicated as used only sparingly and for
        very short periods of time. Yet another—fourth—article on HS54
        appeared in the same journal issue, an editorial identifying HS
        as a “vampire” and the NCI-sponsored studies as “three stakes in
        the heart of hydrazine sulfate.” </p>
      <p><b>The GAO Investigation.</b> Because of evidence of
        irregularities presented to Congress, the ranking members of the
        Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations
        of the House Government Operations Committee ordered a General
        Accounting Office investigation of the NCI-sponsored HS studies
        (the GAO is the investigative arm of Congress). This
        investigation was commenced in June 1994 under the leadership
        and direction of 28-year veteran investigator Barry D. Tice,
        Assistant Director of the GAO, Health Planning Division. The GAO
        soon learned that far from the exclusion of barbiturates and
        short-term use of only Compazine as a tranquilizer, the CALGB
        study included widespread—and in many cases prolonged—use of a
        spectrum of both phenothiazine tranquilizers as well as the more
        powerful benzodiazepine tranquilizers, with no exclusion of
        barbiturates or restriction on use of alcohol. Among the
        phenothiazine tranquilizers used were: chlorpromazine,
        perphenazine, prochlorperazine and triethylperazine; among the
        benzodiazepine tranquilizers were: alprazolam, clorazepate,
        diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, temazepam
        and triazolam; barbiturates included: pentobarbital,
        phenobarbital, secobarbital and donnatal. These are among the
        most powerful depressants known, with such trade names as
        Thorazine, Compazine, Xanax, Valium, Dalmane, Ativan, Restoril,
        Halcion, Nembutal and Seconal. They are all incompatible—and
        potentially dangerous—with MAO inhibitors. It was ascertained
        that many patients in these studies received both phenothiazines
        and benzodiazepines, and some more than one tranquilizer at a
        time. As a consequence the CALGB was forced to publish a new
        paper clarifying the use of these agents. The new paper55
        specified that 94% of all patients received tranquilizers, half
        receiving the main benzodiazepine tranquilizer used, lorazepam
        (Ativan), on a long-term (&gt;48 hours) basis, that the data
        were not computerized and that information regarding the use of
        concomitant medications “was not complete.” At the end of this
        new paper the authors nevertheless maintained: “The correction
        and clarifications offered here do not change the conclusions
        originally reported from our study.” </p>
      <p>The principal question of this investigation was whether or not
        HS was an MAO inhibitor. If so, the NCI-sponsored studies would
        be, by definition, intrinsically flawed (since tranquilizers
        were known to be incompatible with MAO inhibitors). Despite
        pharmacology textbooks identifying hydrazine as an irreversible
        MAO inhibitor over the past 30 years, the NCI vigorously denied
        to GAO investigators that HS was an MAO inhibitor. On September
        14, 1994 Dr. Michael Friedman, associate director of CTEP and in
        charge of NCI's HS studies, wrote to Dr. Vera A. Gorbunova
        inquiring whether “Russian oncologists restrict the
        coadministration of hydrazine with alcohol, antiemetics,
        tranquilizers and barbiturates.”56 Within three weeks he
        received a reply from Russian oncologist Dr. M. B. Bychkof:
        “Hydrazine sulfate is a modulator of biologic reactions…it
        functions as an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase [MAO] and
        therefore cannot be used in combination with alcohol,
        tranquilizers and barbiturates.”57 Nevertheless Dr. Friedman
        would later write to Barry Tice: “That hydrazine sulfate is an
        MAO inhibitor seems unsupported by our review of the data.” 58 </p>
      <p>Repeatedly asserting that HS was not an MAO
        inhibitor—acknowledgment by NCI of MAO inhibition by HS would be
        tantamount to an admission that NCI wittingly or unwittingly
        used known incompatible agents (“negative bias factors”) in its
        HS studies—and leaving GAO investigators confused59—NCI
        submitted to the GAO60 a series of nine “retrospective analyses”
        alleging that even if there were an incompatibility between HS
        and alcohol, tranquilizers and barbiturates, usage of these
        substances made no difference anyway to the studies' outcome.
        But these retrospective analyses were filled with statistical
        irrationalities and subjected to an outside, independent audit
        by consultant biostatistician Richard D. Wilkins, a former
        senior biostatistician at a major pharmaceutical company. In his
        19-page report, Wilkins summarizes: “The NCI retrospective
        analyses, as presented, cannot statistically substantiate any
        claim that the use of adjunctive tranquilizers and/or
        barbiturates had no (deleterious) effect on hydrazine sulfate
        drug action or on survival outcome.”61 </p>
      <p>On June 5, 1995 the GAO issued its 28-page Final Draft Report62
        of its ten-month investigation which was, in effect, a scathing
        criticism of the NCI-sponsored studies, which GAO investigators
        stated actually contributed to, rather than clarified, the
        controversy surrounding HS. Its title was: “NIH Actions Spur
        Continued Controversy Over Hydrazine Sulfate Therapy.” The
        report stated: “NCI did not conduct adequate oversight of these
        trials. It did not take sufficient measures to appropriately
        address concerns over alleged incompatible agents….The issue of
        possible incompatibility of hydrazine sulfate with certain other
        agents is unsettled….The clinical importance of possible
        interaction between hydrazine sulfate and tranquilizing agents,
        barbiturates, or alcohol has not been determined and the issue
        remains unsettled.” This was circulated as a perfunctory
        courtesy to the Food and Drug Administration, the NCI, the
        Public Health Service and “interested congressional committees”
        before publication as an official document. Two days later, as
        set forth in a published investigative article, NCI
        representatives met with GAO, expressing “grave concern” lest
        the Draft Report be made public, and five days later presented
        GAO with an 8-page memorandum “demand[ing] a major rewrite.”63
        Shortly thereafter Barry Tice was removed from his position as
        lead investigator and relieved of all responsibilities in this
        case. Three months later (September 13, 1995) GAO published its
        official—new—report of its investigation. The new title read:
        “Contrary to Allegation, NIH Hydrazine Sulfate Studies Were Not
        Flawed.”64 </p>
      <p>Tice commented, regarding the changes made in the Draft Report
        : “There weren't that many words changed from our Final Draft
        Report, but…the impact of the changes and few key deletions was
        tremendous. Those changes took NCI almost completely off the
        hook….In my almost 30 years at GAO I was rarely forced to accept
        rewrites or deletions that…significantly altered a report's
        message.” 63 </p>
      <p>Tice retired from his long career at GAO soon after the altered
        GAO report was published. However, he was still haunted by the
        lingering doubt as to whether HS was an MAO inhibitor, on which,
        he knew rested the crux of the entire GAO investigation. As a
        private citizen, using his own stationery, he wrote to Robert M.
        Julien, M.D., Ph.D., of St. Vincent Hospital, Portland, Oregon,
        an acknowledged expert in the field of drug interactions and
        author of the seventh edition of A Primer of Drug Action65—whose
        book he had come across after leaving GAO—asking whether HS was
        an MAO inhibitor.66 Tice received a timely reply indicating HS
        was “an irreversible MAO inhibitor”67 (Dr. Julien's emphasis). </p>
      <p>On October 25, 1999, four years after the NCI had so vigorously
        denied to GAO investigators that HS could be an MAO inhibitor,
        lest the NCI-sponsored studies be termed “intrinsically
        flawed”—four years after the GAO investigation had safely
        passed—NCI issued a multipage newsletter on complementary and
        alternative medicine, discussing HS. Its opening line was:
        “Hydrazine sulfate is an MAO inhibitor….”68 </p>
      <p><b>The FDA.</b> On May 7, 199969 FDA's Pharmacy Compounding
        Advisory Committee (PCAC), convened under the stewardship of Dr.
        Jane E. Henney, newly appointed Commissioner of the FDA (who as
        deputy director of the NCI in 1985 included HS in her chapter28
        on unproven methods, at a time when positive,
        placebo-controlled, double-blind data were reporting efficacy
        and safety of the drug)—met to consider, among other questions,
        the de-listing of HS from the “bulk compounding list.” If HS
        were de-listed, this drug would become virtually unavailable in
        this country. </p>
      <p>Because of excesses taken by the advisory committees (although
        these committees were made up of non-FDA scientists and lay
        people, they were nevertheless sympathetic to FDA concerns and
        frequently presented only those viewpoints sanctioned by the
        FDA), Congress passed the Federal Advisory Committee Act of
        January 26, 1998, which provided that presentations made to the
        advisory committees be “fairly balanced in terms of points of
        view presented” and that “the advice and recommendations of the
        advisory committee will not be inappropriately influenced by the
        appointing authority. ” These two provisions were simply meant
        to safeguard against one-sided presentations and/or actions. </p>
      <p>In flagrant violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of
        January 26, 1998, the “appointing authority” (FDA's Center for
        Drug Evaluation and Research), however, invited only those who
        could speak against HS to its PCAC meeting of May 7, 1999. Three
        outspoken adversaries70,71 of HS gave testimony (in favor of
        de-listing) to the committee, one of whom (charged with a
        “conflict of interest” in his role in the NCI-sponsored HS
        studies72) was not present in person but gave testimony by
        videotape and live telephone-hookup. </p>
      <p>The appointing authority issued no invitations to any qualified
        proponents of HS to give testimony, either in person or by
        videotape or by live telephone-hookup, in favor of HS, and
        thereby balance the “points of view presented,” as required by
        the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1998. As a result the
        committee—sustaining a virtual blackout of information on the
        metabolic and clinical efficacy and safety data of the drug as
        presented in the peer-reviewed journals—voted unanimously, 12-0,
        to recommend the de-listing of HS from the bulk compounding
        list. </p>
      <p>On February 6, 2001, section 353a of the Food and Drug
        Modernization Act of 1997, under which authority the PCAC voted
        its recommendation of May 7, 1999 to de-list HS from the bulk
        compounding list, was declared unconstitutional by a panel of
        three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The FDA
        thereupon petitioned this court for a rehearing en banc (all 11
        justices). The Court unanimously declined to do so. FDA then
        took this matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Justice
        Department arguing the FDA's case. On April 29, 2002 the Supreme
        Court upheld the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in effect
        declaring section 353a—and all action taken under its authority
        (including the recommended de-listing of HS)—null and void. </p>
      <p><b>Academe Joins In </b>. What could not be done to eliminate
        HS by official intimidation, by rigged clinical trials, by GAO
        complicity with the NCI, by one-sided PCAC (FDA) action, our
        cancer leadership sought to accomplish by enlisting what can
        only be termed the academic whoredom of one of this nation's
        premiere medical journals. </p>
      <p>As alluded to previously, in its December 5, 2000 issue, the
        influential medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine,
        published a “Brief Communication” and editorial73,74 alleging
        that HS caused fatal hepatorenal (liver/kidney) toxicity in a
        single patient. There was one thing “wrong,” however. No proof
        was presented that the patient ever took HS. The authors stated:
        “We could not obtain samples of the product he [the patient]
        ingested.” This meant there was no possibility of a direct
        examination of what it was the patient was taking. The authors
        further stated: “His blood was not tested for the presence of
        hydrazine.” But there are simple blood tests that will detect
        even the smallest traces of the drug ingested months earlier. It
        must be emphasized that no medical journal anywhere—of high
        repute or not—would publish an article and editorial based on
        one case, calling attention of the medical profession and public
        to the potential toxicity of a drug gaining in common usage,
        without incontrovertible, verifiable, air-tight evidence that
        the patient ever took the drug in the first place. No journal
        would have the ethical recklessness to disseminate an article
        having far-reaching public health consequences without absolute
        proof of its basic assumptions. In this regard the authors
        wrote: “It is not necessary to be certain that a direct
        cause-and-effect relationship exist between the product and the
        adverse clinical event…to file a [toxicity] report [to the
        FDA].” The authors were in effect stating that it was not
        necessary to know for sure that HS caused the adverse clinical
        event before reporting it to the FDA. The authors then stated:
        “This report [the article and editorial] suggests but does not
        prove that hydrazine sulfate caused the liver and kidney
        failure.” Thus, knowing full well that its position was
        unsubstantiated, the Annals, one of this nation's top medical
        journals, went ahead anyway, disseminating its “drug alert” to
        doctors worldwide, across the Internet and onto the front pages
        of newspapers everywhere—without consideration to the heavy
        price that large numbers of cancer patients, their families and
        loves ones would pay if its message were incorrect. </p>
      <p>To understand the moral turpitude of the Annals' action, it is
        necessary to know that—in contrast to the single, reported,
        presumptive case of fatal HS toxicity (in the drug's 30 years of
        use)—there are tens of thousands of authenticated chemotherapy
        fatalities, deaths from chemotherapy drugs, in this country each
        year . Has the Annals, or other medical journals, or our federal
        health agencies, or the prominent private-sector cancer agencies
        ever let the public know this? </p>
      <p><b>AIDS And Hydrazine Sulfate</b> . The two major causes of
        death (“risk factors”) in AIDS patients are weight loss and
        viral (HIV) replication. In 1987 Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
        received a grant from the U.S. National Institute for Arthritis
        and Infectious Diseases (NIH) to study HS in the treatment of
        AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Prior metabolic studies of
        AIDS patients by Harbor-UCLA had revealed that weight loss was
        dependent on serum albumin levels, such that: patients with
        serum albumin levels equal to or greater than 3.5 g/dL survived
        more than 730 days from diagnosis; patients with serum albumin
        levels less than 3.5 g/dL survived 103 days; and patients with
        serum albumin levels equal to or less than 2.5 g/dL survived
        only 17 days.75 Since HS had been demonstrated to result in
        serum albumin maintenance and weight gain in late stage cancer
        paitents,41 it was reasoned that this treatment might result in
        similar metabolic effects in AIDS patients, with the consequence
        of reversal of disease and/or prognosis. </p>
      <p>Although the Harbor-UCLA grant was funded and preparations for
        the study, including patient accrual, had been in progress, the
        study was never commenced and study funds were returned to the
        National Institute for Arthritis and Infectious Diseases. </p>
      <p>The reason for this action was attributed to the ongoing HS
        controversy. </p>
      <p><b>Fueling The Current Controversy.</b> The present controversy
        surrounding HS is sustained by two “arms.” The first is the
        “difference of opinion” generated by the NCI-sponsored, negative
        HS studies, in contradistinction to the long-term, positive
        studies of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and those headquartered at
        the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology. But the NCI-sponsored
        studies of HS—a potent and irreversible MAO inhibitor— were
        carried out in the presence of incompatible agents. The fact is
        that “every…informed-consent, controlled clinical trial of
        hydrazine sulfate—with the exception of the NCI-sponsored
        studies, confounded by the long-term…use of agents known to be
        incompatible with MAO inhibitors—has demonstrated efficacy and
        safety of the drug.”76 It must be stressed that use of
        incompatible agents in a drug trial—or those even suspected of
        incompatibility—is essentially unknown and violates all accepted
        international principles of drug testing. Thus, no matter what
        credentials NCI brings to its sponsored studies—no matter how
        strenuous its voice to the contrary—the NCI studies are
        scientifically invalid . Use of an incompatible agent in a drug
        test in effect violates every precept of study conduct known to
        science. Nor can the NCI assert that the GAO validated its study
        conclusions. The Final Draft Report of the ten-month GAO
        investigation, altered at the last moment, showed the
        NCI-sponsored studies to be inconclusive, to in fact spur on the
        HS controversy; its lead—30-year veteran—investigator was
        relieved of all further responsibility in this investigation;
        and the GAO report was changed dramatically in support of the
        NCI-sponsored studies. The changes made “took NCI almost
        completely off the hook…” according to the lead investigator,
        Assistant Director of the GAO, Health Planning Division, Barry
        D. Tice.63 </p>
      <p>The second “arm” sustaining the HS controversy is comprised of
        economic factors. Unlike most chemotherapy—and anti-AIDS—drugs
        which are costly, HS is almost without expense. Fine biochemical
        companies manufacture HS in essentially two grades:
        technical—lower purity, and reagent—99+% purity, which is
        considered drug quality. The listed (catalog) cost for reagent
        grade—drug quality—HS is only three-quarters of one cent per
        average human dose (60 mg) administered to a cancer patient. A
        front-page story from the Sunday, January 26, 2003, New York
        Times (“Drug Sales Bring Huge Profits, and Scrutiny, to Cancer
        Doctors”) indicates that “cancer doctors are pocketing hundreds
        of millions of dollars each year by selling drugs to
        patients….Oncologists can make huge sums—often the majority of
        their practice revenue—from the difference between what they pay
        for the drugs [they administer] and what they charge insurers
        and government programs….oncologists in private practice will
        typically make two-thirds of their practice revenue from [this]
        chemotherapy concession.”77 Given the extreme inexpense of HS,
        oncologists are not going to make “the majority of their
        practice revenue,” buying HS at such low prices and reselling it
        to patients, insurers and government programs, no matter how
        high the mark-ups. HS thus represents a formidable economic
        challenge to oncologists, for cancer doctors and those who
        administrate and direct our cancer programs are well aware that
        this drug's routine use may significantly reduce not only
        oncology funding and practice income but may also threaten the
        fiscal machinery of cancer centers, cancer hospitals, cancer
        treatment, cancer care, cancer research, cancer administration
        and cancer pharmaceuticals. </p>
      <p><b>The Toll</b>. More than 1.2 million new cases of cancer are
        reported in the U.S. each year; more than 600,000 Americans die
        from this disease annually. The Petrov (Russian) data,
        corroborated by the Harbor-UCLA data,32,78 indicate that of
        every million late stage cancer patients treated with HS, more
        than half a million would receive measurable symptomatic
        improvement, 400,000 would have their tumors cease growing or
        regress, and some would go on to long term survival. </p>
      <p>If these data are correct—as seems likely—the human toll, in
        terms of needless suffering and/or premature death, because of a
        lack of access to HS therapy, has been 5 million persons in the
        last 10 years in the U.S. alone, many more worldwide. </p>
      <p>The National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug
        Administration, as well as private-sector cohorts, are
        principally responsible for this woeful public health calamity.
        Their sham message to the public—of “validity” of the flawed
        NCI-sponsored studies, of potentially fatal “toxicity” of HS, of
        “validation” by the GAO of the NCI study results—has served to
        deceitfully undermine use of what appropriately controlled
        clinical trials have demonstrated to be a safe and effective
        drug and, in so doing, impose a public health menace on
        significant numbers of cancer patients worldwide. </p>
      <p><b>Concluding Remark</b> . The NCI and FDA have the capacity to
        reverse the present situation with HS. The new leadership of
        these agencies can take measures to encourage competitive
        pharmaceutical sponsorship of this drug—and thus new,
        independent, large-scale, unbiased clinical trials—to explore
        fully its therapeutic dimensions in the treatment of cancer and,
        possibly, AIDS. In so doing, these agencies will move to rectify
        past ethical and scientific deficits and assume new high ground
        in the sponsorship of measures beneficial to the public health
        of peoples everywhere. </p>
      <p><b>Recommendation</b> . For those who may be a candidate for HS
        therapy, we recommend you take a copy of this entire statement
        to your physician, together with a copy of the published,
        controlled clinical trials indicating efficacy and safety of HS,
        which can be found on our website: scri.ngen.com. Your physician
        can then help determine a choice of specific therapy for your
        condition and what role, if any, HS may play in your particular
        therapy. </p>

        Institute and the developer of hydrazine sulfate as an

      <p><b>ADDENDUM.</b> It has come to the attention of the Syracuse
        Cancer Research Institute that the National Cancer Institute has
        placed the following misrepresentations on the Internet on June
        18, 2004, repeated verbatim on March 3, 2005
        (http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/hydrazinesulfate/healthprofessional/allpages/print),
in








        regard to hydrazine sulfate: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) “There is only limited evidence from
        animal studies that hydrazine sulfate has anticancer activity.”
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) “Hydrazine sulfate has shown no
        anticancer activity in randomized clinical trials.” </p>
      <p>The first sentence implies there have been no human studies
        that have demonstrated the anticancer activity of hydrazine
        sulfate. But, as NCI well knows, there have been many controlled
        human studies demonstrating the anticancer activity of hydrazine
        sulfate, dating from as far back as 1975 and published in
        leading peer-reviewed cancer journals which circulate worldwide
        (cited in references 15, 17, 23, 27, 29, 34, 35, 41, 78). </p>
      <p>The second sentence states categorically there have been no
        randomized clinical trials demonstrating the anticancer activity
        of hydrazine sulfate. RCTs represent the “gold standard” of
        clinical trials, in that they are prospectively randomized,
        placebo-controlled, double-blind and thus tend to minimize study
        bias from all sources. But NCI knows there have been four such
        randomized clinical trials demonstrating the anticancer activity
        of hydrazine sulfate (references 27, 34, 35, 41), all of which
        NCI has been aware from the very beginning. </p>
      <p>NCI knows that the above statements it has currently placed on
        the Internet are simply not true. </p>

        &nbsp; <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Many different types of chemical compounds have been used in
        the past to retard or inhibit various tumors in man. More than
        thirty compounds are approved for use in cancer therapy in
        various countries, but the achievement of therapeutic benefit
        has reached a plateau, and the search for antitumor agents
        continues in various directions. </p>
      <p>In 1967, Weitzel and co-workers reported in the Zeitschrift
        fuer Physiologische Chemie, 348, 433-442 that hydrazine acetate
        and sulfate inhibit in vivo the growth of ascites carcinoma and
        sarcoma 180 in the mouse and Walker carcinosarcoma in the rat.
        It is well known that the results from lower animals cannot be
        extrapolated in humans. Indeed, the experience at the U.S.
        National Institutes of Health has been that more than 200 new
        chemotypes having anticancer activity in animals have failed to
        show clinically useful anticancer activity in humans, as shown
        in the following table (Table I was compiled from various
        reports of the U.S. National Cancer Institute): </p>
      <p>In addition, hundreds of analogs of the new and old chemotypes
        have failed to show anticancer activity in man, in spite of good
        antitumor activity in animals. In contrast to the above, only
        about five new chemotype anticancer drugs have reached the
        market in the last 25 years. Hence, early reports that hydrazine
        sulfate had antitumor activity in animals did not serve to
        predict that it might have anticancer activity in humans. </p>
      <p>Because of this poor predictability of animal models, the
        National Cancer Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of
        Health has now abandoned the mouse model after 25 years of
        unproductive trial and is instituting a new in vitro program for
        discovering new antitumor drugs (E. Eckholm, New York Times,
        Dec. 23, 1986, p. C1). </p>
      <p>A total inventory of cancer drugs approved for sale in the
        United States is set forth in Table II, and it will be seen that
        most of these are analogs of other drugs. Table III shows that,
        with one exception, all of the recent New Drug Applications
        filed for anticancer drugs led to unapprovable ratings by the
        U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Table IV shows that the last
        new chemotype which succeeded in the clinic was discovered more
        than 20 years ago. </p>
      <p>A review of the FDA's New Drug Evaluation - Statistical Report
        (March 1986) shows that no novel anticancer drug is pending
        approval at the FDA. </p>
      <p>Table IV lists the anticancer drugs approved in the United
        States. The last non-hormonal anticancer agent to be approved in
        the U.S. was etoposide in 1983. </p>
      <p>The following are the years of discovery of the major
        anticancer drugs on the U.S. market (arbitrarily assumed to be
        one year before the first publication): </p>
      <p>Thus, there have been no new chemotype cytotoxic anticancer
        drugs discovered in the past twenty years. Consequently, there
        remains an unfulfilled need for additional cancer drugs for
        clinical use against tumors in humans. </p>
      <p>Up the present time, it has been generally unrecognized that a
        specific anticachexia agent (by virtue of its ability to
        interrupt those specific thermodynamic metabolic processes
        leading to cancer cachexia) possesses antitumor potential, by
        virtue of a systematic thermodynamic interrelationship between
        tumor progression (tumor energy gain) and cancer cachexia (host
        energy loss); this has been taught in the scientific literature
        since 1974 (J. Gold, Cancer Cachexia and Gluconeogenesis, Ann.
        N.Y. Acad. Sci., 230, 103-110 (1974)). Thus, while it is true
        that any antitumor agent may have anticachexia potential, if
        curative, it is also true that a specific anticachexia agent may
        have potential for increased patient survival. However, it is
        not obvious, nor predictable, from the prior art that hydrazine
        sulfate would possess this potential. </p>
      <p>In 1978, the present inventor was issued U.S. Pat. No.
        4,110,437 for the treatment of cancer cachexia with hydrazine
        sulfate. Investigations were also undertaken to ascertain
        whether hydrazine sulfate could retard tumor growth in humans.
        However, these early studies were inadequate and failed to
        statistically demonstrate antitumor activity. </p>
      <p>A group at Sloan-Kettering concluded after a trial that: "The
        clinical observations recorded in this report fail to support a
        role for hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer agent. We conclude
        that its clinical utilization is not warranted at present and do
        not plan further trials."(Ochoa et al., Cancer Chemotherapy
        Reports, Part 1, Vo. 59, No. 6, Nov./Dec. 1975; pp. 1151-1154).
      </p>
      <p>In addition, a group at the University of Virginia repoted
        that: "Hydrazine sulfate as administered in this series failed
        to demonstrate any objective or subjective antitumor activity
        and no further trials are currently planned."(Lerner and
        Regelson, Cancer Treatment Reports, Vol. 60, No. 7, July 1976,
        pp. 959-966). Another later publication by Regelson et al.
        stated: "In conclusion, we feel that hydrazine sulfate as given
        in this study is an inactive compound."(Cancer Chemother.
        Pharmacol., 3, 121-124, 1979). </p>
      <p>Thus, the prior art taught that hydrazine sulfate appeared to
        be inactive against primary tumor growth in man. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is based on the discovery that hydrazine
        sulfate, when administered parenterally or orally in effective,
        non-toxic amounts to humans with tumors of the lung, prostate,
        breast, ovaries, thyroid, pancreas, lymph, cervix,
        gastrointestinal tract and other sites will significantly
        prolong survival of early-stage human cancer patients, while
        improving the patient's quality of life. <br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        <b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The dosages of hydrazine sulfate employed in the present
        invention can vary from 1 to 5 mg/kg daily, which is well below
        the LD50 and has been found to be well tolerated in the majority
        of early-stage patients so treated for periods of up to four
        years. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the regimen followed is one 60 mg capsule of
        hydrazine sulfate daily for the first three days, then two such
        capsules daily for the next three days, and then three 60 mg
        capsules each day thereafter. In actual practice, patients
        weighing over 130 pounds do well on three or four 60 mg capsules
        daily. For patients weighing less than 100 pounds, the regimen
        followed is preferably one 30 mg capsule of hydrazine sulfate
        daily for the first three days, then two such capsules daily for
        the next three days, and then two or three 30 mg capsules each
        day thereafter. For best results blood levels of hydrazine
        sulfate should be determined on these patients in order to
        establish a most effective non-toxic dose. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate therapy can advantageously be combined with
        other modalities for cancer treatment like chemotherapy,
        immunotherapy, radiation and surgery. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate is most effective when administered usually
        by itself one or two hours before meals in the form of a gelatin
        capsule. If desired, the sulfate can be dissolved or suspended
        in sterile, aqueous, isotonic saline solution and given orally
        and parenterally. Likewise, hydrazine sulfate can be formulated
        with solid carriers such as talc, corn starch or stearic acid
        and compressed into tablets for oral administration. Such
        tablets can be enteric coated with shellac or cellulose acetate
        phthalate in a manner well known to those skilled in the
        pharmaceutical art. </p>
      <p>The efficacy of hydrazine sulfate in prelonging survival in
        early-stage human cancer patients has now been demonstrated for
        the first time in a placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment
        with a statistically significant number of subjects. </p>
      <p>Early-stage human cancer patients are distinguished from
        late-stage human cancer patients on the basis of the nature of
        their symptoms. These symptoms have been quantitatively
        correlated by two recognized methods of categorization: the
        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
        Score (also known as Zubrod's ) and the Karnofsky Rating Scale.
        The relationship between these two methods and the resulting
        division of human cancer patients into early-stage and
        late-stage, as recognized by ECOG and Karnofsky rating criteria,
        is set forth as follows: </p>
      <p>Stage of ECOG Performance Karnofsky Nature of Cancer Status
        Score Rating Symptoms ______________________________________
        Early 0 100 Asymptomatic without physical limitation Early 1
        80-90 Symptomatic, but fully ambulatory Late 2 60-70
        Symptomatic, but in bed less than 50% of day Late 3 40-50
        Symptomatic, in bed more than 50% of day, but not bedridden Late
        4 20-30 Bedridden ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>In the placebo-controlled, double-blind experiemnt referred to
        above, to determine whether hydrazine sulfate treatment is
        associated with a survival benefit (R.T. Chlebowski et al.,
        "Influence of Hydrazine Sulfate on Survival in Non-Small Cell
        Lung Cancer: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial", presented
        at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical
        Oncology, May 17-19, 1987, Atlanta, Georgia), sixty-five
        patients with unresectable, non-small cell lung cancer and no
        prior chemotherapy were randomized to receive combination
        chemotherapy with either hydrazine sulfate or placebo addition
        for a period of up to four years. All received
        Platinol/Velban/Blenoxane (PVB) chemotherapy every 28 days,
        consisting of Platinol 100 mg/m.sup.2 ; Velban 4 mg/m.sup.2,
        days 1 and 2; and Blenoxane 10 units every 8 hours for three
        doses. After the initial three cycles, the Blenoxane was
        discontinued and the Platinol dose was reduced to 50 mg/m.sup.2.
      </p>
      <p>Pre-chemotherapy factors including age, sex, performance status
        (PS), prior weight loss and disease extent were comparable in
        the two groups, with pre-chemotherapy performance status (0-vs.
        2) and prior weight loss (&gt;10%) subsequently influencing
        overall survival (p&lt;0.05). Toxicity was that expected from
        PVB with three patients not continuing hydrazine sulfate because
        of additional nausea. Survival by hydrazine sulfate or placebo
        were: </p>
      <p>Median Survival bv Patient Group Treatment Group All Patients
        PS 0-1 Patients ______________________________________ Hydrazine
        Sulfate 292 days 328 days* Placebo 173 days 209 days
        ______________________________________ Statistical analysis of
        the data was by the generalized Wilcoxon (Breslau) method.
        Comparison of the hydrazine sulfate and placebo groups showed
        statistical significance at the *P&lt;0.01 level. All of the
        survival benefit of hydrazine sulfate was in the performance
        status 0-1 group. For the performance status (PS) 2 patients,
        whose condition was poor, survivals were short (median 132 days)
        and closely comparable whether on placebo or hydrazine sulfate.
        Thus, hydrazine sulfate addition, as an anti-cachexia agent
        directed primarily at correcting abnormal host mechanism,
        significantly increased patient survival in early-stage patients
        with non-small cell lung cancer. </p>
      <p>Specifically, this increased survival time occurred in
        early-stage human cancer patients with Performance Status 0 or 1
        (PS 0-1), whereas late-stage patients (PS 2) did not exhibit
        prolonged survival. </p>
      <p>Several patients with tumors of the prostate, lung, breast,
        ovary, lymph, cervix, thyroid, pancreas and other tumor sites
        were treated with hydrazine sulfate according to the preferred
        regimen previously set forth. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Many different types of chemical compounds have been used in
        the past to retard or inhibit various kinds of tumors. Such
        compounds include insulin, fluorouracil, estrogen, tolbutamide,
        biguanides and nitrogen mustards. However, the degree of
        successful therapy to date has been marginal at best so that the
        search for better and more effective anti-tumor agents
        especially in humans continues at a feverish pace. </p>
      <p>In 1967, Weitzel and co-workers reported in Z. Physiol. Chem.
        348, 433-442 that hydrazine acetate and sulfate inhibit in vivo
        the growth of ascites carcinoma and sarcoma 180 in the mouse and
        Walker carcinosarcoma in the rat. It is well known that such
        encouraging results in lower animals cannot be extrapolated to
        determine what effect the same compounds would have on other
        tumor types or even on the same tumors in humans. Until now,
        hydrazine sulfate in particular has never been used to treat
        cancerous cachexia. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is predicated upon the discovery that hydrazine
        sulfate when administered either orally or parenterally in
        effective, non-toxic amounts to humans afflicted with tumors of
        the prostate, lung, breast, ovaries, thyroid, pancreas, lymph,
        cervix or gastrointestinal tract will restore the strength of
        such patients by reducing the cachexia associated therewith by
        continuing its use even in the absence of tumor reduction. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>The dosages of hydrazine sulfate employed in the present
        invention can vary from 2 to 5 mg/kg daily which is well below
        the LD.sub.50 dosage and has been found to be well tolerated in
        the majority of patients so treated. Preferably, the regimen
        followed is one 60 milligram capsule of hydrazine sulfate daily
        for the first three days, then two such capsules daily for the
        next 3 days and three 60 milligram capsules each day thereafter
        until the patient shows definite signs of improvement. If
        adequate response is observed on two such capsules daily, the
        patient should be maintained on this dosage and not increased.
        In actual practice, patients weighing over 130 pounds do well on
        four 60 milligram capsules daily whereas patients weighing less
        than 100 pounds generally respond on a dosage of 30 milligrams
        administered twice a day. </p>
      <p>Hydrazine sulfate is most effective when administered by itself
        one to two hours before meals in the form of a gelatin capsule.
        If desired, the sulfate can be dissolved or suspended in
        sterile, aqueous, isotonic, saline solution and given orally or
        parenterally. Likewise, hydrazine sulfate can be formulated with
        solid carriers such as talc, corn starch or stearic acid and
        compressed into tablets for oral administration. Such tablets
        can be enteric coated with shellac or cellulose acetate
        phthalate in a manner well known to those skilled in the
        pharmaceutical art. </p>
      <p>Several patients with tumors of the prostate, lung, breast,
        ovary, lymph, cervix, thyroid and pancreas were treated with
        hydrazine sulfate according to the preferred regimen previously
        set forth. Subjective results observed within a week of such
        therapy included restoration of vigor and a sense of well being.
        Objective results included cessation of weight loss and ensuing
        weight gain plus restoration to normal of abnormal blood
        chemistries. Although the tumors in these patients did not
        completely regress, there was a definite, noticeable inhibition
        in the growth of the tumors within 1 to 3 weeks of therapy. In
        each instance, the hydrazine sulfate was given daily for several
        weeks just as insulin is given to a diabetic thus making it
        possible for the patients to endure their affliction and prolong
        their lives. Less than 3% of the patients displayed minor side
        effects including transient gastritis which was quickly relieved
        by reducing the dosage to about one-half for a few days before
        reinstituting full dosage. Beneficial effects were likewise
        observed in the retarding and reducing of cancerous cachexia by
        continuing the use of hydrazine sulfate even in the absence of
        tumor reduction in said patients. </p>
