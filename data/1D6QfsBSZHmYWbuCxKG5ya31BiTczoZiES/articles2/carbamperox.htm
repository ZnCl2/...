      <p>Systematic (IUPAC) name -- hydrogen peroxide; urea <br>
        CAS number&nbsp; 124-43-6 <br>
        PubChem&nbsp; -- 31294 <br>
        Formula&nbsp; -- CH6N2O3 <br>
        Mol. mass&nbsp; -- 94.07 g·mol?1 <br>
        Routes --&nbsp; topical (teeth or mouth) </p>
      <p>Carbamide peroxide, also called urea peroxide, urea hydrogen
        peroxide, and percarbamide, is an oxidising agent, consisting of
        hydrogen peroxide compounded with urea. The molecular formula is
        CH6N2O3, or CH4N2O.H2O2. It is a white crystalline solid that
        releases oxygen in contact with water. </p>
      <p>The chemical is a skin, eye and respiratory irritant. It is
        also corrosive and causes burns. It doesn't hurt at 10%
        concentration (3% hydrogen peroxide equivalent) but it might
        hurt at 35% (12% equivalent), causing white chemical burns on
        skin and gums alike. </p>
      <p>Pure carbamide peroxide has the form of white crystals or
        crystal powder, is slightly soluble in water (0.05 g/mL)[1], and
        contains approximately 35% hydrogen peroxide. </p>
      <p><b>Uses</b> </p>
      <p>Carbamide peroxide is used to </p>
      <p>* whiten teeth [2] [3]; <br>
        * relieve minor inflammation of gums, oral mucosal surfaces and
        lips including canker sores and dental irritation[4]; and to <br>
        * emulsify and disperse ear wax.[4] </p>
      <p>Carbamide peroxide is commonly encountered in cosmetic
        dentistry, where it is used to "bleach" teeth. The active
        ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, which acts to oxidise
        interprismatic extrinsic staining within tooth enamel. There are
        several methods of applying the peroxide gel to the tooth
        ranging from night-guard application at home or in-surgery
        application. The bleaching obtained is proportional to the
        length of time the peroxide is applied to the tooth, and the
        concentration used. The concentration most commonly used for
        tooth whitening purposes is 15%. </p>
      <p>A 10% solution in glycerol is used to treat ulcers and other
        lesions in the mouth. </p>
      <p>A 6.5% concentration solution is used to loosen and remove
        earwax. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Are tray-based teeth whitening systems
              utilizing a 10% carbamide peroxide whitener safe to use?</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>While it is important to know that a teeth whitening system can
        be effective, it is clearly much more important to know that it
        is safe to use. At-home tray-based teeth whitening (teeth
        bleaching) methodology using a 10% carbamide peroxide tooth
        whitener was first introduced to the dental community in a paper
        published in 1989. Since that time numerous of dental studies
        have investigated safety considerations that might be associated
        with the use of this technique. </p>
      <p>This research has led to the general consensus that while this
        technique is not without side effects, dentist-dispensed at-home
        tray-based teeth whitening systems utilizing a 10% carbamide
        peroxide whitener are safe to use. And, in fact, this type of
        whitening system has gained wide acceptance by the dental
        community as a whole. The overwhelming majority of dentists in
        this country do offer tray teeth whitening systems to their
        patients because they know it has been time tested to be both
        safe and effective. </p>
      <p><b>Why should tooth whiteners used with tray-based whitening
          technique be formulated with carbamide peroxide?</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout our text we have made reference to the use of a
        carbamide peroxide whitener with tray-based teeth whitening
        technique. You might ask yourself, what is carbamide peroxide
        and why is it used in tooth whitener formulations? </p>
      <p>As you can discern from its name, carbamide peroxide is a type
        of peroxide. Peroxides are a class of compounds, the most well
        known one probably being hydrogen peroxide. You may already be
        familiar with hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is sold as a
        household antiseptic. Usually it comes in a brown bottle and has
        a concentration of 3%. </p>
      <p>In the case of tooth whiteners it is their peroxide component
        that is their active ingredient. Peroxide molecules break down
        (oxidize) pigmented compounds trapped in a tooth's enamel into
        colorless byproducts, thus producing a lightening effect. As it
        happens, the peroxide that is counted upon to perform this
        oxidation process is hydrogen peroxide. So, right now you may be
        wondering why, since it is hydrogen peroxide that does the work,
        do our pages stress the use of carbamide peroxide tooth
        whiteners? </p>
      <p>At-home tray based teeth whitening products. Carbamide peroxide
        is a compound composed of hydrogen peroxide and urea. In the
        presence of water carbamide peroxide breaks down into its
        component parts, thus providing the hydrogen peroxide needed to
        perform the tooth whitening <br>
        process (the urea plays no role). The reason carbamide peroxide
        is used in whiteners is because it is a relatively more stabile
        molecule than hydrogen peroxide. By using carbamide peroxide in
        their whitener formulations manufacturers can deliver the
        hydrogen peroxide needed to produce the lightening effect yet
        create a product that has a more predictable and longer shelf
        life. </p>
      <p>Along these same lines, when the compound hydrogen peroxide is
        formulated into a whitener it will decompose almost immediately.
        The net result is that it will have finished producing its
        oxidation effects within the first hour of being placed into the
        bleaching tray. In comparison, carbamide peroxide degrades more
        slowly. Studies have shown that a carbamide peroxide tooth
        whitener it will release about 50% of its hydrogen peroxide in
        the first two to four hours and then the remainder over the next
        two to six hours. This slower release of peroxide and creation
        of a more gradual oxidation process is thought to help to
        minimize whitening side effects. </p>
      <p><b>What are the safety concerns associated with the use of 10%
          carbamide peroxide teeth whiteners?</b> </p>
      <p>As we state in our section titled "About at home teeth
        whitening products: Know what you are buying.", all references
        to teeth whiteners <br>
        , bleaches, bleaching agents, bleaching gels, etc... found on
        the pages of this topic refer to 10% carbamide peroxide
        whitening products. With the continued accumulation of data by
        dental researchers over the last 15 years, it has become
        generally accepted by the dental community that 10% carbamide
        peroxide whiteners (when utilized in conjunction with tray-based
        whitening technique) are safe to use (when these products are
        used as directed by both the product's manufacturer and the
        person's dentist). </p>
      <p><b>Will 10% carbamide peroxide teeth whiteners cause cancer?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Concerns have been postulated that teeth whiteners can possibly
        cause cancer of the soft tissues of the mouth. These concerns
        are related to the fact that the peroxide contained in teeth
        whiteners breaks down to form molecules called "free radicals."
        Free radicals are capable of causing cellular damage. </p>
      <p>The appropriate use of dentist-monitored at-home teeth
        whiteners containing 10% carbamide peroxide have not been shown
        to produce a carcinogenic risk. </p>
      <p>* The concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced by these
        whiteners is low, on the order of 3.5%. Studies involving
        hydrogen peroxide at about this same concentration (actually
        3.0%) have not shown a carcinogenic risk. </p>
      <p>* When using custom bleaching trays fabricated by a dentist the
        contact between the tooth whitener and a person's soft tissues
        ("gums") is minimal. </p>
      <p>* One of the human body's main defenses against the adverse
        effects of peroxide is a compound found in saliva. This compound
        has been calculated to be able to effectively neutralize about
        30mg of peroxide in one minute. The typical single application
        of carbamide peroxide tooth whitener is only 3.52 mg. </p>
      <p>* Calculations have estimated that on average the total amount
        of peroxide that a person is exposed to each day when bleaching
        their teeth is less than .1% of the daily production of peroxide
        created by their liver. </p>
      <p><b>Will 10% carbamide peroxide teeth whiteners damage tooth
          enamel?</b> </p>
      <p>Studies evaluating 10% carbamide peroxide whiteners have found
        minimal or no effect on the microhardness or mineral content of
        tooth enamel surfaces. Scanning electron microscope studies of
        the enamel of teeth that have been bleached have typically not
        shown damage either. As a point of comparison, studies have
        shown that exposure to soft drinks and fruit juices can cause
        comparable or greater alteration of tooth enamel than tooth
        whiteners. <br>
        Two clinical cases have been documented in dental literature
        where the use of an over-the-counter teeth whitener has
        adversely affected the enamel of a person's teeth. These cases
        involved whiteners that had either: a high peroxide content, an
        acidic pre-rinse, or the whitener itself was acidic. These
        whiteners were purchased and used without the oversight of a
        dentist. </p>
      <p>The tooth damage caused by these whiteners was irreversible and
        the dental treatment needed to repair the damage involved
        significant effort and cost. If you haven't already, please read
        our discussion titled: "About at home teeth whitening products:
        Know what you are buying." </p>
      <p><b>Will 10% carbamide peroxide teeth whiteners damage the nerve
          in my tooth?</b> </p>
      <p>Research studies and the clinical observation of the dental
        community as a whole have not identified a problem associated
        with the use of dentist-dispensed at-home tray-based teeth
        whitening systems utilizing a 10% carbamide peroxide whitener
        and the health of the nerve tissue found in the user's teeth.
        One study's specific findings were that no one in their 4.5 and
        7-year follow up groups reported requiring root canal treatment
        for any tooth that had received whitening treatments. </p>
      <p><b>Will peroxide-based teeth whiteners damage my existing
          dental restorations?</b> </p>
      <p>At home teeth whitening cannot be expected to lighten fillings.
        Teeth can be whitened using an at-home bleaching system
        employing a 10% carbamide peroxide whitener with little concern
        about significant damage to a person's existing fillings. More
        than 15 years of clinical use of these products has not revealed
        any significant problems or concerns. </p>
      <p>Some studies have suggested that some degree of interaction or
        change might occur with white dental fillings, amalgam dental
        fillings, and some types of dental cements. However, the
        clinical significance of these effects is still considered to be
        inconclusive. (Our "Effects of peroxide whiteners on existing
        dental work." page discusses some of the findings related to the
        effect peroxides can have on various types of dental materials.)
        Your dentist can address any specific concerns you may have
        during your pre-whitening dental examination. </p>
      <p>The main difficulty encountered in conjunction with existing
        dental work is that it does not lighten during the whitening
        process (with the exception that the color of porcelain veneers
        may be affected). This means that pre-existing dental work will
        usually have to be replaced so to match a person's new, post
        bleaching tooth shade. </p>

      <b>Abstract</b> -- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide an improved
      method for bleaching the surface of teeth of a person intending to
      make the appearance of the surface of the teeth beautiful.
      SOLUTION: A prescribed amount of a dental bleaching composition is
      placed in a dental tray, which is then arranged on the tooth
      surface so as to bring a part of the composition into contact with
      a tooth to be bleached. Thereby, the dental tray is arranged on
      the tooth surface. After the passage of a prescribed time, the
      dental tray is removed from the tooth to bleach the tooth. The
      dental bleaching composition comprises about 3 to about 20 wt.%,
      preferably about 4 to about 15 wt.% carbamide peroxide as a dental
      bleaching agent and a matrix material containing about 3.5 to
      about 12 wt.%, preferably about 4.5 to about 10 wt.%
      carboxypolypolymethylene as the matrix material for dispersing the
      bleaching agent therein.; The carboxypolymethylene contained
      therein at the concentration has a high viscosity and is hardened
      when brought into contact with a saliva to form a seal around the
      dental tray. Thereby, the composition is held in a state thereof
      in contact with the tooth surface.

      <b>Abstract</b> -- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To obtain a dentifrice
      composition having an action removing pigmentation of teeth and
      also promoting remineralization of the surface of the teeth.
      SOLUTION: This composition contains 0.1-90wt.% a calcium compound
      (e.g.; hydroxyapatite) and 0.05-10wt.% carbamide peroxide.
      Hydroxyapatite has an action performing remineralization of the
      surface enamel of teeth, carbamide peroxide has an action removing
      pigmentation of teeth and a synergistic effect is exhibited by
      mixing both, then a whitening and a removing action of
      pigmentation of the teeth are exceedingly increased and
      simultaneously a mineralization effect of the surface of the teeth
      is reserved. A mixture of more than two species of tricalcium
      phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium dihydrogen
      phosphate, octacalcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate can be
      used instead of hydroxyapatite as the calcium compound.

      <b>Abstract</b> -- Toothpaste. It comprises carbamide peroxide in
      a proportion between 0.1% and 20% weight/volume, glycerine in a
      proportion between 50% and 110% weight/volume and the thickener is
      a carboxyvinyl polymer in a proportion between 1% and 5%
      weight/volume. The carbamide peroxide is in the same phase as the
      other components of the toothpaste, the pH of which is between 3
      and 6. It has a high antiseptic and whitening power and provides a
      chemicomechanical cleaning, whitening and débridement action with
      the aid of the brushing action. It is especially indicated in the
      prevention and relief of buccopharyngeal conditions and in the
      whitening of the teeth.

      <b>Abstract</b> -- There is disclosed a process and a material for
      brightening teeth. The process comprises the construction of a
      splint around the tooth or teeth to be brightened, followed by the
      insertion within the splint of a brightening agent selected from
      one of many peroxide groups. The splint is constructed so that the
      splint is relatively liquid tight to the gingiva. The brightening
      agent is periodically renewed and can be mixed with various other
      agents to increase the nascent oxygen release aerating factors. In
      one embodiment, the peroxide that is used is a 10% solution of
      carbamide peroxide mixed with a water free gel.<br>
