      “The seaweed very dramatically reduces cow-burped methane to the

          seaweed will make them less gassy — which could be great news

      ..."From the cows, half of the methane emissions is from the
      belching of the animal and the other half is from the manure,"
      said Ermias Kebreab, one of the researchers behind cows consuming
      seaweed and an animal-science professor at the University of
      California-Davis. "You can use additives such as seaweed to try to
      reduce the methane that's belched out of the animal."<br>
      <br>
      Kebreab and his team are demonstrating the seaweed project this
      week and plan to publish preliminary findings in late June and
      begin further tests with additional cattle later this summer.<br>
      <br>
      According to Kebreab, the project is supported by several
      non-profits, including Elm Innovations, an organization out of
      Stanford University. Another contributor is the 11th Hour Project
      — a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, a private foundation
      created by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.<br>
      <br>
      "This is really the first trial on dairy cattle that's been done
      ever in the world," Kebreab said. "From what I've seen so far, it
      seems to work quite well. But there's a lot of stuff we need to do
      before this can be a viable solution."<br>
      <br>
      Based on preliminary findings, Kebreab said a touch of seaweed
      added to the cattle's diet appears to reduce dairy cow's gassiness
      by "well over 30 percent."<br>
      <br>
      Kebreab said the methane emissions could be lowered even more by
      increasing the seaweed concentration used from about 1 percent to
      2 percent of the cow's diet.<br>
      <br>
      The researcher said cows usually consume about 50 pounds of feed
      per day, and the seaweed mixture represents only around half a
      pound of the animal's diet. There's been no drop in milk yields on
      the cows using the seaweed additive.<br>
      <br>
      "You're not changing the main diet of the animal," he said. "It's
      just a matter of mixing the additive to their diet and providing
      the seaweed."..<br>

          These UC Davis scientists hope to find out</b><br>
        <b>By Benjy Egel</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Early indications of a UC Davis study show feeding dairy cows
      seaweed may reduce methane emissions caused by their belching, the
      university announced Thursday.<br>
      <br>
      UC Davis animal science professor Ermias Kebreab and animal
      biology PhD candidate Breanna Roque separated 12 Holstein cows
      into three groups, two of which received different doses of
      seaweed in their feed and one of which got no seaweed at all.<br>
      <br>
      "The numbers we’re seeing are amazing — well beyond the target
      that farmers will need to reach," Kebreab said in a media release.
      "This is a very surprising and promising development."<br>
      <br>
      The two test groups eat seaweed sweetened with molasses for two
      weeks at a time before returning to a normal diet for a week. Each
      cow eats a snack from an open-air device that simultaneously
      measures their breath's methane content. Their milk is also tested
      for yield, flavor and nutritional content throughout the
      experiment...<br>
      <br>
      “Results are not final, but so far we are seeing substantial
      emission reductions," Kebreab said. "This could help California’s
      dairy farmers meet new methane-emission standards and sustainably
      produce the dairy products we need to feed the world.”<br>
      <br>
      An Australian lab found in 2016 that making seaweed two percent of
      a cow's feed could inhibiting gas-producing enzymes and cut
      methane emissions by 99 percent. The UC Davis experiment is the
      first to test the theory on live animals, according to the
      university...<br>

        </b><b>Study: Seaweed in Cow Feed Reduces Methane Emissions
          Almost Entirely</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A recent study by researchers at James Cook University in
      Queensland, Australia, has found a certain type of Australian red
      algae can significantly inhibit methane emissions from cows. Led
      by Professor of Aquaculture Rocky De Nys, researchers found an
      addition of less than 2 percent dried seaweed to a cow’s diet can
      reduce methane emissions by 99 percent. The study was conducted in
      collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
      Research Organization (CSIRO), an Australian federal research
      agency.<br>
      <br>
      Methane is about 25-times more potent than carbon dioxide in a
      100-year time span, and a single cow releases between 70 and 120
      kilograms of methane per year. Burps from cows account for 26
      percent of the United States’ total methane emissions, and the
      U.S. is only the world’s fourth-largest producer of cattle, behind
      China, Brazil, and India. There are currently approximately 1.3 to
      1.5 billion cows roaming the planet.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers started investigating the potential effect of seaweed
      on cows in 2005, when a dairy farmer named Joe Dorgan
      inadvertently conducted an experiment on his herd in Prince Edward
      Island, Canada. Dorgan noticed cows that grazed on washed-up
      seaweed in paddocks along the shore were healthier and more
      productive than those that stayed in the field. He began feeding
      his cows a mixture of local storm-tossed seaweed and found the new
      diet saved him money and induced “rip-roaring heats,” or longer
      cycles of reproductive activity.<br>
      <br>
      Dorgan is not the first farmer to discover the beneficial
      properties of seaweed in farm animals. The practice was used by
      Ancient Greeks in 100 B.C, according to the U.N. Food and
      Agriculture Organization. There are also records of Icelandic
      farmers using kelp and algae to keep livestock healthy and produce
      larger milk yields.<br>
      <br>
      A 2014 study by Canadian researchers Rob Kinley and Alan Fredeen
      confirmed the results of Dorgan’s experiment and found, in
      addition, that “feeding seaweeds and macroalgal products has been
      shown to reduce enteric methane emission from rumen fermentation.”
      In short, seaweed can reduce the amount of methane cows emit into
      the atmosphere with their gas. Kinley joined De Nys in Australia
      two years later to conduct further in vitro tests.<br>
      <br>
      Kinley and De Nys tested 20 different species of seaweed on
      bacteria found in the stomachs of cows. They discovered seaweed
      reduced methane production by up to 50 percent, depending on the
      amount administered. But methane reduction at notable levels
      required high doses of seaweed, almost 20 percent by weight of the
      sample. This large percentage of seaweed would be difficult to
      implement outside of the lab and would likely have a negative
      effect on cow’s digestion.<br>
      <br>
      When the researchers tested a species of red algae called
      Asparagopsis taxiformis that grows off the coast of Queensland,
      Australia, they found it reduced methane production by more than
      99 percent in the lab. In addition, it only required a dose of
      less than 2 percent to work effectively. Upon digestion,
      Asparagopsis produces a compound called Bromoform (CHBR3), which
      interacts with enzymes in ruminant stomachs and halts the cycle of
      methane production before the gas is released into the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      In 2011, Dorgan sold his dairy farm in order to start selling
      seaweed-infused cow feed full-time. The company he part-owns,
      North Atlantic Organics, uses traditional methods of seaweed
      production like hand-raking and solar drying to reduce its carbon
      footprint and ensure the final product is free of additives...<br>

      <br>
      However, researchers and farmers will have to overcome
      considerable roadblocks before the technique can be implemented on
      an industrial scale. Most dairy and cattle operations are located
      inland, far from the sea and its supply of seaweed. More
      importantly, producing enough Asparagopsis to feed even 10 percent
      of Australia’s feedlot and dairy cattle would require upwards of
      15,000 acres of commercial seaweed farms. Wild harvesting could
      work on a farm-by-farm basis, but the practice becomes unfeasible
      on a large scale.<br>
      <br>
      “That is the number one barrier — getting enough seaweed to feed
      to millions of cows,” Kinley said in an interview with Australia’s
      ABC news.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Livestock feed modification is a viable method for reducing
      methane emissions from ruminant livestock. Ruminant enteric
      methane is responsible approximately to 10% of greenhouse gas
      emissions in Australia. Some species of macroalgae have
      antimethanogenic activity on in vitro fermentation. This study
      used in vitro fermentation with rumen inoculum to characterise
      increasing inclusion rates of the red macroalga Asparagopsis
      taxiformis on enteric methane production and digestive efficiency
      throughout 72-h fermentations. At dose levels 1% of substrate
      organic matter there was minimal effect on gas and methane
      production. However, inclusion 2% reduced gas and eliminated
      methane production in the fermentations indicating a minimum
      inhibitory dose level. There was no negative impact on substrate
      digestibility for macroalgae inclusion 5%, however, a significant
      reduction was observed with 10% inclusion. Total volatile fatty
      acids were not significantly affected with 2% inclusion and the
      acetate levels were reduced in favour of increased propionate and,
      to a lesser extent, butyrate which increased linearly with
      increasing dose levels. A barrier to commercialisation of
      Asparagopsis is the mass production of this specific macroalgal
      biomass at a scale to provide supplementation to livestock.
      Another area requiring characterisation is the most appropriate
      method for processing (dehydration) and feeding to livestock in
      systems with variable feed quality and content. The in vitro
      assessment method used here clearly demonstrated that Asparagopsis
      can inhibit methanogenesis at very low inclusion levels whereas
      the effect in vivo has yet to be confirmed.<br>

          Atlantic stormtoss seaweeds on ruminal digestion</b><br>
        <b>R. D. Kinley, A. H. Fredeen</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Feeding seaweeds and macroalgal products has been shown to reduce
      enteric methane emission from rumen fermentation. On Prince Edward
      Island, Canada, stormtoss shoreweed (SHW) consists of variable
      seaweed proportions of Chondrus crispus (Irish moss; IM),
      Laminaria longicruris, and Fucus vesiculosus. The impact of
      invasion by Furcellaria spp. (FF) and its increasing proportion in
      SHW harvests on feeding value has not been evaluated. The aim of
      this study was to determine effects of feeding SHW on ruminal
      fermentation and methane production. Effects were assessed in
      vitro using continuous culture with pooled rumen inocula from
      Holstein cows. In vitro cultures were maintained on 30 g day−1 of
      the dietary dry matter (DM) fed to donor cows and were
      supplemented with FF or IM at 0.14, or SHW at 0.14 (SHW1), 0.28
      (SHW2), or 0.56 (SHW3) g DM day−1. There was little change in pH,
      total volatile fatty acids, or the acetate/propionate ratio due to
      seaweeds. The SHW mix and component seaweeds reduced the
      post-fermentation level of NH3-N suggesting decreased deamination
      of dietary and microbial amino acids. Methane emission was reduced
      on average 12 % with seaweeds and maximally by 16 % with SHW2.
      Reduction in methane production was not induced by impaired
      organic matter (OM) digestibility which averaged 46 %. North
      Atlantic SHW has potential based on in vitro screening at these
      doses to be fed to ruminants with beneficial effects on methane
      production at little cost to dietary digestibility.<br>
