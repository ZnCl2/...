      <b> </b><br>
      The invention relates to specifically relates to a preparation
      method for calcium carbonate whiskers extracted from limestone,
      belonging to the field of inorganic micropowder. According to the
      preparation method, natural limestone is subjected to
      fragmentation and crushing and then mixed with a proper amount of
      water and a surface modifier, and the calcium carbonate whiskers
      with structured morphology can be directly obtained through the
      processes of generation, dissolving, decomposition and
      crystallization of calcium bicarbonate. The preparation method
      comprises the following key technical steps: (1) introducing
      high-pressure CO2 gas into limestone dust suspension with the
      proper amount of the surface modifier so as to convert calcium
      carbonate into water-soluble calcium bicarbonate; and (2)
      controlling decomposition of water-soluble calcium bicarbonate
      under proper reaction conditions so as to allow the calcium
      carbonate whiskers mainly of aragonite structures to be
      precipitated. The preparation method has low requirement on raw
      materials and completes both purification and crystallization in
      the process of preparation; and the calcium carbonate whiskers
      have hydrophobic surfaces, show good dispersibility in matrixes
      like organic solvents and high-molecular resin and are applicable
      to the industrialization fields of paint, plastics, polymer
      composites, etc.<br>

      An inexpensive detergent builder in the form of a selected
      crystalline calcium carbonate is provided. Specifically, the
      crystalline calcium carbonate has a tabular crystalline structure
      with {0,1,0} and {1,1,0} crystallographic indices. The crystalline
      calcium carbonate can be aragonite that has been specially
      modified to a tabular crystalline structure with {0,1,0} and
      {1,1,0} crystallographic indices. The crystalline calcium
      carbonate of the present invention is extremely inexpensive
      because it can be readily formed from inexpensive naturally
      occurring aragonite, and it performs well even when used at large
      median particle sizes.<br>

      PURPOSE:To enable efficiency industrial production of calcium
      carbonate having aragonite crystal form, by blowing CO2 gas into
      an aqueous slurry of Ca(OH)2 under specific condition.
      CONSTITUTION:Calcium carbonate is produced by blowing CO2 gas into
      an aqueous slurry of Ca(OH)2 under the following reaction
      condition. The concentration and temperature of the aqueous slurry
      of Ca(OH)2 are adjusted to 5-40wt.% and 5-60 deg.C, respectively,
      and the slurry is added with an additive and carbonated by
      introducing CO2 gas at a rate of &lt;=4l/min/kg.Ca(OH)2 (in terms
      of 100% CO2). The additive is e.g. phosphoric acid, phosphoric
      acid compound, barium compound and strontium compound. The amount
      of the additive is preferably 0.2-6.0wt.% based on the calcium
      hydroxide and the CO2 concentration of the CO2 gas is preferably
      10-40%.<br>

      PURPOSE:To produce easily aragonite type calcium carbonate having
      superior dispersibility by introducing gaseous CO2 into aq. slurry
      of Ca(OH)2 having a specified concn., temp., and content of
      soluble phosphate. CONSTITUTION:0.1-20wt.% [basing on the amt. of

      terms of tervalent PO4&lt;3-&gt; is added to aq. slurry of Ca(OH)2
      having 5-40wt.% concn. at 5-45 deg.C. A carbonation reaction is
      caused by introducing gaseous CO2 into the slurry to obtain thus

      The present invention relates to the preparation process of high
      purity aragonite type calcium carbonate whisker. The present
      invention prepares aragonite type calcium carbonate whisker with
      lime or slaked lime as main material and magnesium salt as crystal
      salt controlling agent and through a CO2 carbonating process. The
      process features the repeated use of the magnesium salt solution
      and the homogeneous replenishment of lime slurry during
      carbonating reaction. The process has low production cost, less
      environmental pollution and high calcium carbonate whisker yield,
      and the prepared calcium carbonate whisker has high purity and
      high length/diameter ratio. The process is suitable for industrial
      production of calcium carbonate whisker.<br>
