      Since the plasma-generating oven is disposed in the vertical

      </b><b>FULLERENE AND ITS PRODUCTION</b><br>
      PURPOSE: To obtain fullerene with excellent reproducibility in a
      state capable of various operations or controls on a
      room-temperature stage by irradiating high-energy beams to an
      amorphous carbon in vacuum in the presence of an active metal.
      CONSTITUTION: The objective huge fullerene such as onion-like
      graphite is generated from carbon atoms existing near the surface
      layer of amorphous carbon by irradiating electron beams having
      &gt;=1×10&lt;19&gt; e/cm&lt;2&gt; .sec intensity to amorphous
      carbon in a vacuum atmosphere of &lt;=10&lt;-5&gt; Pa in the
      presence of an active metal such as pure Al ultrafine particles of
      about 5-100nm diameter. Alternatively, huge fullerenes such as
      carbon nanocapsule, carbon nanotube or onion-like graphite are
      generated from a carbon source existing the surface layer of
      semi-stable metal oxide particles by irradiating electron beams
      having &gt;=1×10&lt;19&gt; e/cm&lt;2&gt; .sec intensity to
      semi-stable metal oxide particles such as ?-Al2 O3 about 50-200nm
      diameter existing on amorphous carbon in a vacuum atmosphere of
      &lt;=10&lt;-5&gt; Pa.<br>

      </b><b>PRODUCTION OF CARBON CLUSTER C60</b><br>
      PURPOSE:To obtain a carbon cluster C60 of improved purity by
      separating carbon cluster C60 through liquid column chromatography
      from a carbon cluster mixture obtained by extracting soot in an
      exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine with an aromatic
      hydrocarbon. CONSTITUTION:A fuel such as gasoline is burned in the
      cylinder of an internal combustion engine and soot is collected
      from the exhaust gas from an exhaust vent. The soot is then
      extracted with an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene using a
      Soxhlet extractor to obtain a carbon cluster mixture whose content
      is 0.1-5wt.% in the soot. On subjecting the mixture to mass
      spectroscopy, carbon cluster (hereafter, referred to as fullerene)
      C60 and fullerene C70 can be recognized at mass/charge of 720 and
      840, respectively. The mixture is then developed with e.g. hexane
      using liquid column chromatography packed with neutral Al2O3 as
      absorbent to obtain a hexane solution of fullerene C60 followed by
      evaporating the hexane, thus obtaining the objective high-purity
      fullerene C60.<br>

      </b><b>SEPARATION OF FULLERENE C60 AND C70 USING CRYSTALLIZATION</b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention provides a method for separating two
      highly pure fullerenes from a mixture of fullerenes comprising
      crystallizing a first fullerene component and a second futlerene
      component, wherein the phase equilibrium behavior of the mixture
      fed to a crystallizer is characterized by a region(s) where a pure
      fullerene of the two fullerenes or the solid solution or solvate
      thereof can be crystallized out. In particular, the present
      invention provides a method for simultaneously separating two
      highly pure fullerenes from a mixture of fullerenes via
      crystallization, which comprises (i) adjusting the amount of a
      solvent in the mixture fed to a first crystallizer to obtain a
      phase equilibrium behavior such that a first fullerene components
      of the two fullerenes, in the form of a pure crystal, a solid
      solution crystal, or a solvate crystal is obtained during
      crystallization; (ii) adjusting the amount of a solvent in the
      mixture fed to a second crystallizer, operating at a different
      temperature compared to the first crystallizer, to obtain a phase
      equilibrium behavior such that a second fullerene component of the
      two fullerenes, in the form of a pure crystal, a solid solution
      crystal, or a solvate crystal is obtained during crystallization;
      and additionally (iii) purifying the solid solution or the solvate
      into a highly pure fullerene, when the solid product from the
      crystallizers is in the form of a solid solution or a solvate. The
      method according to the present invention allows to obtain up to
      99.99% pure fullerenes, with relatively low production and
      separation cost. The method can be applied for various two
      fullerenes-solvent systems.<br>
