      The present invention relates to a pyramid-shaped subtle energy
      generating device emitting scalar waves, which is characterized by
      winding a coil around quartz in a clockwise direction and putting
      the quartz into a pyramid-shaped body. The device of the present
      invention is configured to generate scalar waves using a scalar
      wave generating coil wound in the opposite direction with the same
      number of windings and right-handed torsion waves using a
      right-handed torsion coil wound clockwise starting at the center
      from free electrons present in a living space. The pyramid-shaped
      body for accumulating the free electrons is made by piling up a
      mixture of 50% minerals such as steel shavings, quartz shavings,
      brass shavings, copper shaving, etc. and 50% polyester resin into
      a pyramid shape to effectively accumulate the free electrons, and
      the accumulated free electrons pass through the coils wound the
      quartz to generate scalar waves and right-handed torsion waves. A
      drawn line is connected to the top of the pyramid-shaped body to
      effectively deliver the generated scalar and right-handed torsion
      waves to a human body. Therefore, the pyramid-shaped subtle energy
      generating device generates the scalar waves not using a man-made
      power source and provides energy beneficial to the human body.<br>

      There is disclosed a new low-level laser therapy apparatus and
      method of treating tissue. The invention includes a laser system
      that uses laser diodes and/or alternatively light emitting diodes
      (LED's), or both, and a digital interface that gives the operator
      the ability to generate sine waves or scalar waves as opposed to
      the simple on/off square waves. The invention also enables the
      operator to modulate not only the frequency, but also other wave
      characteristics such as the amplitude and phase. In one aspect,
      the invention involves modulating the phase relationship between
      multiple waves by taking one channel or wave which is pulsed
      through the laser system and then running a second channel or wave
      in relationship to the first channel, thereby creating a phased
      relationship, which has been discovered to provide a therapeutic
      and quantum healing effect on tissue.; In one exemplary
      embodiment, the laser system of the invention may have a phase
      relationship of approximately 180 degrees which provides a
      beneficial therapeutic and quantum healing effect and, in

      A frequency transfer system for the destruction of pathogens using

      medium contains at least one square wave at a frequency known to
      affect specific pathogens. Additional mathematically congruent
      square waves can also be recorded on the medium for simultaneous
      transmission. The transfer unit contains a coil and an amplifier.
      The coil absorbs the magnetic flux from the electromagnetic square
      waves and outputs scalar square waves. The amplifier increases the
      voltage and reverses the wave polarities to place the greatest
      scalar potentials at the positive node of said output square wave.

      FIELD: radio communications and radiolocation, geological

      is provided with second waveguide and second exciting component;
      exciting components are installed in waveguides which have
      different length and are brought to single plane through their
      open ends and further through return horn to equally shaped adding
      waveguide terminating in horn. Waveguides differ by half-length of
      common radiated electromagnetic wave. In planar-wave approximation
      strength vectors of electric and magnetic fields are oriented in
      longitudinal-scalar electromagnetic wave in open space collinearly
      to vector of electromagnetic energy flux density (S = Ei |Hi| + Hi
      |Ei|).Irrotational electric field of longitudinal electromagnetic
      wave builds up potential difference across open electric conductor
      longitudinally oriented to this field.; Magnetic field of
      longitudinal-scalar electromagnetic wave acts upon moving electric
      charges by force directed along their velocity vector. ^ EFFECT:
      enhanced reliability due to use of irrotational
      longitudinal-scalar electromagnetic waves apart from rotational

      PURPOSE:To generate power in space, etc., without a jet gas by
      installing metal for capacitor and having low magnetism at both
      the ends of an air-core coil respectively, and by generating a
      scalar electromagnetic wave when the winding direction of the coil
      is specified to be electrified. CONSTITUTION:Metal 1 for capacitor
      and having low magnetism is installed at both the ends of an
      air-core coil 2 respectively in charging one side of the metal 1
      for capacitor to plus, the winding direction of the coil 2 is set
      in the direction of winding in which the metal 1 is magnetized to
      S. An AC current is carried into the coil 2. When the electric
      potential of the one-side metal 1 is changed from plus to minus,
      the metal 1 is magnetized to N. Next, when charged fully to minus,
      magnetism is eliminated due to the absence of a material for
      storing magnetic force. Thus, charging from minus to plus, tries
      to enable magnetization to S. Those actions generate monopole
      electromagnetic pattern, plus N, minus S, around the metal 1 to
      generate a scalar electromagnetic wave. Thus, its output is
      utilized as a substitute for a rocket engine, for example, in
      space.<br>

      Information that changes as a function of time is communicated
      from a transmitting site to a receiving site by transmitting a
      signal comprising scalar and vector potentials without including
      ay electromagnetic field. The potentials vary as a function of
      time in accordance with the information.<br>

          <b>INTERACTING COMPLEX ELECTRIC FIELDS AND STATIC ELECTRIC
            FIELDS TO EFFECT MOTION</b></big><br>

      Systems and methods of interacting complex electric fields and
      static electric fields to effect motion are disclosed. An example
      method includes producing an action force having a reaction force
      perpendicular to the action force by interacting a relative
      velocity electric field based on charge of a moving first charged
      object and a static charge on a second charged object in a
      different inertial frame of reference. Another example method
      includes producing an action force having a reaction force
      perpendicular to the action force by interacting an acceleration
      generated electric field based on acceleration of a first charged
      object and a static charge on a second charged object in a
      different inertial frame of reference. Another example method
      includes producing an action force having a reaction force
      perpendicular to the action force by interacting a scalar electric
      potential and static electric field.<br>

          <b>GEOPATHOGEN RADIATION NEUTRALIZER.</b></big><br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DELGADO JUAN IGNACIO JAIME<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      The present invention refers to a neutralizer of geopathogen
      radiations resulting from the subsoil by underground water streams
      or geological faults, as well as radiations produced by the
      different electric devices working at 60 Hz and 50 Hz and the
      conduction lines thereof, also those generated by cellular
      telephony antennas and other types of radio-transmission. The
      present invention consists of a panel located under a bed
      mattress, said panel being a set of elements formed by equidistant
      rectangular coils and quartz-filled fixed magnets that produce a
      scalar magnetic pulsating potential field of low extreme frequency
      ranging from 3 Hz to 11 Hz, including the Schumann frequency. A
      microcontroller device is included, which, by means of program,
      emits the different frequency cycles that are biocompatible with
      the brain and natural resonances characteristics of the human
      being. Under the interference and superposition principle, the
      scalar electromagnetic pulsating potential field of low extreme
      frequency (100 nT of mattress level magnetic flow intensity)
      produces a frequency mixture which results in a dominant pulse
      train of extreme low frequencies, thus achieving the
      neutralization of the harmful frequencies of lower than 3 Hz, as
      well as those of 60 Hz and 50 Hz and higher. The invention
      provides the user a geopathogen radiation-free zone while
      sleeping, thereby attaining a deep rest of high quality, and a
      reestablishment of his vital potentials upon an improved
      production of ATP.<br>
