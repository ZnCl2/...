      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine engine is a type of Rotary engine, invented by
        the Saint-Hilaire family, with patents awarded in 1996 and 2003.
        The engine uses a four-sided articulated rotor that turns within
        a stator, creating regions of increasing and decreasing volumes
        as the rotor turns. The Quasiturbine design can also be used as
        an air motor, steam engine, gas compressor, hot air engine, or
        pump. It is capable of burning fuel using photo-detonation, an
        optimal combustion type. </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine (Qurbine) or Kyotoengine is a pressure driven
        continuous torque deformable spinning wheel; a no-crankshaft
        rotary engine having a 4-faced articulated rotor with a free and
        accessible centre, rotating without vibration or dead time, and
        producing a strong torque at low RPM under a variety of modes
        and fuels. The Quasiturbine can be used as air motor, steam
        engine, Stirling engine, compressor and pump. The Quasiturbine
        is also an optimization theory for extremely compact and
        efficient engine concepts. </p>
      <p><b>How It Works</b> </p>
      <p>In the Quasiturbine engine, the four strokes of a typical cycle
        de Beau de Rochas - Otto cycle are arranged sequentially around
        a near oval, unlike the reciprocating motion of a piston engine.
        In the basic single rotor Quasiturbine engine, an oval housing
        surrounds a four-sided articulated rotor which turns and moves
        within the housing. The sides of the rotor seal against the
        sides of the housing, and the corners of the rotor seal against
        the inner periphery, dividing it into four chambers. In contrast
        to the Wankel engine where the crankshaft moves the rotary
        piston face inward and outward, the Quasiturbine rotor face
        rocks back and forth with reference to the engine radius, but
        stays at a constant distance from the engine center at all time,
        producing only pure tangential rotational forces. Because the
        Quasiturbine has no crankshaft, the internal volume variations
        do not follow the usual sinusoidal engine movement, which
        provides very different characteristics from the piston or the
        Wankel engine. </p>
      <p>As the rotor turns, its motion and the shape of the housing
        cause each side of the housing to get closer and farther from
        the rotor, compressing and expanding the chambers similarly to
        the "strokes" in a reciprocating engine. However, whereas a four
        stroke cycle engine produces one combustion stroke per cylinder
        for every two revolutions, i.e. one half power stroke per
        revolution per cylinder, the four chambers of the Quasiturbine
        rotor generate four combustion "strokes" per rotor revolution;
        this is eight times more than a four-stroke piston engine. </p>

          <b>Quasiturbine Steam Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Advantages</b> </p>
      <p>Quasiturbine engines are simpler, and contain no gears and far
        fewer moving parts. For instance, because intake and exhaust are
        openings cut into the walls of the rotor housing, there are no
        valve or valve trains. This simplicity and small size allows for
        a savings in construction costs. Because its center of mass is
        immobile during rotation, the Quasiturbine tends to have very
        little or no vibration. Due to the absence of dead time between
        strokes, the Quasiturbine can be driven by compressed air or
        steam without synchronized valve, and also with liquid as
        hydraulic motor or pump. Other claimed advantages include high
        torque at low rpm, combustion of hydrogen and compatibility with
        photo-detonation mode in Quasiturbine with carriages, where high
        surface-to-volume ratio is an attenuating factor of the violence
        of the detonation. </p>
      <p><b>History</b> </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine was conceived by a group of 4 researchers lead
        by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist. The
        original objective was to make a turbo-shaft turbine engine
        where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in
        the same plane. In order to achieve this, they had to disconnect
        the blades from the main shaft, and chain them around in such a
        way that a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn,
        and as an engine the following quarter of a turn. </p>
      <p>The general concept of the Quasiturbine was first patented in
        1996. Small pneumatic and steam units are available for
        research, academic training and industrial demonstration.
        Similar combustion prototypes are also intended for
        demonstration. In November 2004, a Quasiturbine engine was
        demonstrated on a go-kart. Precommercial pneumatic and steam
        units are available for sale in 600 cc and 5 liters displacement
        sizes. </p>
      <p><b>Potential Applications</b> </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine's high power-to-weight ratio makes it
        exceptionally suitable for aircraft engine and its no-vibration
        attributes make it suitable for use in, for example: chainsaws,
        powered parachutes, snowmobiles, jet skis and other watercraft,
        aircraft,etc. Variations on the basic Quasiturbine design also
        have applications as air compressors and as turbochargers.
        Rotary expander applications include gas pipeline pressure
        recovery, low thermal heat recovery, heat pumps, pneumatic air
        energy storage and recovery... It is well suitable to recover
        the pressure energy of hydrogen storage while recovering the low
        heat energy generated by fuel cells. </p>
      <p><b>Wankel Comparison</b> </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine is superficially similar to the Wankel engine,
        but is quite distinct from it. The Wankel engine has a single
        rigid triangular rotor synchronized by gears with the housing,
        and driven by a crankshaft rotating at three times the rotor
        speed, which moves the rotor faces radially inward and outward.
        The Wankel attempt to realize the four strokes with a
        three-sided rotor, limits overlapping port optimization, and
        because of the crankshaft, the Wankel has near sinusoidal volume
        pulse characteristics like the piston. The Quasiturbine has a
        four-sided articulated rotor, rotating on a circular supporting
        track with a shaft rotating at the same speed as the rotor. It
        has no synchronization gears and no crankshaft, which allows
        carriage types to shape "almost at will" the pressure pulse
        characteristics for specific needs, including achieving
        photo-detonation. </p>
      <p>The Wankel engine divides the perimeter into three sections
        while the Quasiturbine divides it into four, for a 30% less
        elongated combustion chamber. The Wankel geometry further
        imposes a top dead center residual volume which limits its
        compression ratio and prevents compliance with the
        Pressure-Volume diagram. The Wankel has three 30 degree dead
        times per rotor rotation, while the Quasiturbine has none which
        allows continuous combustion by flame transfer, and allows it to
        be driven by compressed air or steam without synchronized valves
        (also by liquid as a hydraulic motor or pump). During rotation,
        the Wankel apex seals intercept the housing contour at variable
        angles up to from -60 to +60 degrees, while the Quasiturbine
        contour seals are almost perpendicular to the housing at all
        time. While the Wankel engine requires dual (or more)
        out-of-phase rotors for vibration compensation, the Quasiturbine
        is suitable as a single rotor engine, because its center of mass
        is immobile during rotation. While the Wankel shaft rotates
        continuously, the rotor does not, as it stops its rotation (even
        reverses) near top dead center, an important rotor angular
        velocity modulation generating strong internal stresses not
        present in the Quasiturbine. </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine circumvent 3 major Wankel deficiencies: (1)
        The excessive exhaust-intake overlap, Wankel trying to make
        4-stroke with a 3 side rotor, while the Quasiturbine is making 4
        stroke with a 4 side rotor with no overlap. (2) The Wankel
        chamber geometry does not close properly at TDC (unable to
        gather the gas in one location, leaving it spreaded around the
        chamber). This is a similar (or worse) situation as that of a
        flat surface piston with a flat cylinder head (where the gas is
        not gathered in one location - Such a piston geometry is showing
        a similar problem as the Wankel). The Quasiturbine chamber
        closes at TDC in gathering most of the gas in one location, like
        the modern piston does. (3) The Wankel chamber minimum volume is
        not constant as it is reduced during rotation, which prevents
        the applicability of the P-V efficiency diagram. </p>
      <p><b>Photo-Detonation</b> </p>
      <p>Detonation is a phenomenon that occurs when an air/fuel mixture
        is compressed well past the point of thermal-self-ignition. This
        is commonly called knocking in piston engines and is generally
        not desired in conventional sinusoidal pressure pulse type
        engines. Detonation is a very efficient combustion mode, a mode
        that has this far not been successfully exploited in piston or
        Wankel engine designs. Diesel combustion (without detonation) is
        driven by thermal ignition of a fuel pulverized into very hot
        air; gasoline piston engine combustion is driven by a relatively
        slow, controlled, thermal combustion wave through an homogeneous
        mixture; "knocking" detonation also happens in an homogeneous
        mixture, driven by a supersonic shock wave, or ultimately by
        radiation as photo-detonation. </p>
      <p>Supersonic shock wave detonation is accidentally seen in
        gasoline engines, because the vaportzation of micro-droplets is
        only partially completed at the time of maximum compression. To
        actually achieve photo-detonation, a fast and narrow pressure
        pulse like that achieved in the Quasiturbine is necessary to
        rapidly skip straight through the sequence of events
        (thermo-ignition and shock waves), and rapidly access that mode.
        Little information or research is available regarding this
        phenomenon because engineers first need to control the less
        demanding shock wave detonation. Photo-detonation (designation
        specific to fuel mixture) is today mainly a curiosity among
        scientists, but the special pulse characteristics of the
        Quasiturbine will help bring this phenomenon into actual
        application. </p>
      <p>Because the Quasiturbine has no crankshaft and can have
        carriages, the pressure pulse can be shaped like the minuscule
        cursive letter " i ", with a high pressure tip 15 to 30 times
        shorter than the piston or Wankel volume pulse, and with rapid
        linear rising and falling ramps. This kind of pressure pulse is
        self-synchronizing and reduces the immense stresses by
        shortening the high pressure duration. </p>
      <p><b>Efficiency at Low Power</b> </p>
      <p>The modern high-power piston engine in automobiles is generally
        used with only a 15% average load factor. The efficiency of a
        200 kW gas piston engine falls dramatically when used at 20 kW
        because of high vacuum depressurization needed in the intake
        manifold, which vacuum becomes less as the power produced by the
        engine increases. Photo-detonation engines do not need an intake
        vacuum as they take in all the air available, and mainly for
        this reason, efficiency stays high even at low engine power. </p>
      <p>The development of a photo-detonation engine may provide a
        means to avoid that low-power-efficiency penalty; may be more
        environmentally friendly as it will require low octane
        additive-free gasoline or diesel fuel; may be multi-fuel
        compatible, including direct hydrogen combustion; and may offer
        reduction in the overall propulsion system weight, size,
        maintenance and cost. For these reasons it could be better than
        or competitive with hybrid car technology. </p>
      <p><b>Hybrid Alternative</b> </p>
      <p>It is the purpose of the hybrid car concept to avoid the low
        efficiency of the Otto cycle engine at reduced power. There is a
        50% fuel saving potential, of which about half could be
        harvested the hybrid way. But getting extra efficiency this way
        requires additional power components and energy storage, with
        associated counter-productive increases in weight, space,
        maintenance, cost and environmental recycling process. The
        development of a photo-detonation engine like the Quasiturbine
        would provide more direct means to achieve the same or better. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>While most rotary engines use the principle of volume variation
        between a curve and a moving cord of fixed length, this new
        engine concept uses a four degrees of freedom X, Y, .theta.,
        .PHI. rotor, confined inside an internal housing contour, and
        does not require a central shaft or support. The invention is an
        assembly of four carriages supporting the pivots of four
        pivoting blades forming a variable-shape rotor. This rotor rolls
        just like a roller bearing on the surface of an housing internal
        contour wall shaped like a skating rink. During the rotation,
        the rotor pivoting blades align alternatively in a lozenge and a
        square configuration. All ports are radial in the housing and/or
        axial on the lateral side covers. Since the compression and
        expansion strokes start and end simultaneously, an ignition
        flame transfer slot is used to maintain a continuous combustion
        while four strokes are completed in every rotation. A central
        shaft is not needed for the engine to operate, but can be added
        and driven by the blades, through a mechanical arms coupling.
        The device incorporates few parts, does not need a crankshaft or
        a flywheel, and can be made strong enough to meet the criteria
        of photo-detonation and direct hydrogen combustion. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to internal combustion engines
        and relates specifically to a rotary internal combustion engine
        having a four degrees of freedom rotor, confined into a
        calculated housing internal contour wall. As a perfectly balance
        device without crankshaft, this invention is a true rotary
        engine, by opposition to rotary piston engine. This device also
        relates to compressors, and pressure or vacuum pumps. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b> </p>
      <p>Many rotary engine concepts have been proposed including a
        pressure energy converter, rotary engine or compressor as in
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,068,985, 3,996,899; a rotary disk engine as in
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,404,850; a rotary planetary motion engine as in
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,078; a rotary detonation engine as in U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,741,154; a rotary combustion engine as in DE Pat. No.
        2,448,828, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,933,131, 4,548,171, 5,036,809; the
        Wankel type engine as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,228,183, 4,308,002,
        5,305,721, and a continuous combustion engine as in U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,996,899. Most rotary engines, and particularly the Wankel
        and those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,442,257, 3,614,277,
        4,144,866, 4,434,757, DE Pat. No. 3,027,208 are based on the
        principle of volume variation between a curve and a moving cord
        of fixed length as a sliding single piston-object. This
        invention does not use this principle, since the housing contour
        wall has four zones of maximum curvature, and the maximum volume
        as well as the compressed volume, are both located in a minimum
        curvature area. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The object of this invention is to provide a new engine concept
        making use of a four degrees of freedom rotor, confined inside
        an internal housing contour wall, constituting an hybrid
        piston-turbine engine where the rotor acts alternatively and
        similarly as a compressor turbine and a power turbine, unifying
        in one, both of the turbines in a conventional gas turbine
        engine. </p>
      <p>An other object of this invention is to provide a low noise,
        perfectly balanced, zero vibration, low rpm engine, making use
        of a more efficient and less NO.sub.x productive asymmetric
        pressure cycle, giving less time to compression and exhaust
        stroke, and allowing more time and volume to the intake and
        combustion stroke. </p>
      <p>A further object of this invention is to provide a fast
        accelerating, zero dead time engine, and to provide an engine
        almost universal in relation to energy sources, which can run
        efficiently on pneumatic, steam, hydraulic, liquid and gas fuel
        internal combustion, and due to its short pressure peak and cold
        intake area characteristics, is as well suitable for
        photo-detonation mode and pure hydrogen fuel combustion. </p>
      <p>An other further object of this invention is to provide a high
        weight and volume density engine, compressor or pump, without
        need of any valve, check valve or obstruction, and with neither
        a crankshaft or a flywheel. </p>
      <p>In order to achieve those objects, the present invention uses a
        four degrees of freedom rotor X, Y, .theta., .PHI., confined
        into a calculated housing internal contour wall, which does not
        require any central shaft or support for most applications. This
        concept has an optimum efficiency like the piston, because the
        maximum expansion volume at the end of each stroke is exactly
        equal to the volume generated by the movement of the tangential
        surface of push over a rotation. </p>
      <p>The rotor is composed of four inter-linked pivoting blades, the
        pivoted ends of which are supported by a set of four carriages,
        free to rock on those same pivots. The assembly of the four
        blades and four carriages forms the rotor which is confined
        within the housing internal contour wall. Two plane side covers
        close the engine end. Intake, sparkplug and exhaust ports are
        made either radial in the housing, or axial in the side covers,
        or both. </p>
      <p>Sealing with the side covers is effected by a system of linear
        and pellet type seals in contact with the plane side covers, and
        a spring loaded housing contour seal (apex) sitting on each
        carriage located in-between its set of wheels, and always
        perpendicular to the housing contour wall. The chamber is
        defined by two successive contour seals, and extend between the
        housing contour wall, and the related pivoting blade. </p>
      <p>Rotation of the rotor bring successively the pivoting blades
        farther and closer of the housing contour wall, thus producing
        the compression needed by the engine, with possibility of very
        high compression ratio. Since there are four pivoting blades
        simultaneously involved in the four strokes cycle, this engine
        fires four times every revolution, with no dead time. The
        central engine area is empty, but can have a central shaft,
        linked to the four pivoting blades, or hold other devices such
        as an electric generator, a jet blades, a blower or a pump. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>

        apparent when considered in reference to the accompanying

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary rotary internal combustion
        engine according to the present invention is shown and is
        designated generally by reference numeral 10. The rotary engine
        10 includes a housing 11 with a particular internal contour wall
        12 and two lateral plane covers, containing a rotor composed of
        four pivoting blades 13 and four rocking carriages 17 and wheel
        18. Each pivoting blade 13 has a filler tip 14 and a traction
        slot 15, and their two ends pivots 16 sit on their respective
        rocking carriages 17. </p>
      <p>The basic geometry of the rotor is shown on the FIG. 2 blow up,
        for two different rotor angle positions. The rotor is composed
        of four (one more blade 13 is shown due to blow up) pivoting
        blades 13 playing a similar role as the pistons or turbine
        blades, one end of each pivoting blade having a hook pivot 16
        and the other end a cylinder pivot 16. Each pivot 16 sits into
        one of the four rocking carriages 17 (one more carriage 17 is
        shown due to blow up). Each carriage 17 is free to rotate around
        the same pivot 16 in such a way as to be continuously and
        precisely in contact with the housing contour 12. Each rocking
        carriage 17 carries a housing contour seal of one of different
        design 24, 25, 26 midway between the wheel axes 19. The chamber
        is defined by two successive contour seals 24 or 25 or 26, and
        extends between the housing contour wall 12, and the related
        pivoting blade 13. There are four variable volume chambers
        forming two quasi-independent consecutive circuits, each
        producing a compression and an expansion stroke, which start and
        end simultaneously. In the four stroke engine operation, the
        first circuit is used to compress and to expand after
        combustion, the next circuit is used to expel the exhaust and to
        intake the air. </p>
      <p>A central shaft 32 is not needed for the engine to operate.
        However a central shaft 32 can be driven through a set of
        coupling arms 33 as shown in FIG. 2, attached to the blades 13
        by means of the traction slots 15 and through a set of arm
        braces 34, the ends of which are linked to the central shaft.
        Those link braces 34 are also useful to remove the RPM harmonic
        modulation on the shaft. Notice from FIGS. 1 and 2 that the
        central shaft assembly 32, 33, 34 is a sliding plug-in unit,
        easily removed through the back cover central hole 23 without
        dismantling the engine. In some applications, a central bearing
        attachment not shown is used to diminish the load pressure on
        the carriages 17 and against the opposite housing contour wall
        12. When a central bearing is used, carriage wheels 18 can be
        replaced by rubbing pads since their role is then only to
        maintain the carriages 17 properly aligned for adequate contour
        seal 24, 25, 26 angle. No tensioning device has been proven
        necessary to keep all carriages 17 in good contact with the
        housing contour wall 12. </p>
      <p>The assembly of carriage 17 and wheels 18 must be voluminous
        but not necessarily heavy, in order to fill a substantial volume
        in the chamber. Pivoting blades 13 are shaped with a filler tip
        14 to allow the control of the residual volume in the upper and
        lower chambers at maximum pressure square configuration, as seen
        on FIGS. 1. and 2. left. The top of the filler tip 14 must be
        shorten such to permit an adequate compression ratio, and to
        insure that only a fraction of the gas is in the tiny
        interstices at the time of fire. Because the pressure pulse at
        top dead center is much shorter than in piston engine, the shape
        of the combustion chamber is much less critical. Carriage wheels
        18 should be wide to reduce contact pressure with the contour
        wall 12. To distribute wear, the front and back wheels 18 of the
        same carriage 17 are positioned off line with overlapping paths.
        For smoother operation, roller bearing are inserted in the
        blade's 13 hooks pivot 16, to link friction free the cylindrical
        end of each pivoting blade 13 to the carriage 17 pivot surface.
      </p>
      <p>A lateral seal for the low pressure applications is used on
        each side cover 21,22, and is made of a compression ring along
        the pivot 16 path 20. This quasi-elliptical seal is made of a
        slight deformation of a flexible metal sheet jacket (not shown).
        For high-pressure application, standard gate like linear seals
        28 in the rotor blades 13 are provided. At pivots 16, the
        lateral sealing is assumed by a set of arc blade pellets 29,
        circular blade pellets 30, and carriage grooved pellets 31, all
        pressing against the side covers 21, 22. The large blade pellet
        30 gains to have a hole (not shown) in the center to prevent
        pressure push back. </p>
      <p>Spring loaded housing contour seals 24, 25, 26 of different
        possible designs are incorporated in a groove in the carriages
        17 between the axes 19 of the two wheels 18 to insulate the
        chambers. Each housing contour seal 24, 25 26 sits on a rocking
        carriage 17 in such a manner as to be always perpendicular to
        the engine housing contour wall 12. For intermediary pressure
        applications, a sliding gate type seal 24 is used. A butterfly
        type seal 25 suitable for low to moderate pressure applications
        is made of a stack of flat springs, which has the advantage of a
        minimal course during the rotation, but may be subject to
        excessive friction at high pressure. An advanced split contour
        seal 26 design suitable for very demanding applications uses a
        sloped groove in the carriage 17, and the internal chamber
        pressure to help maintaining itself in place at all time. This
        split contour seal design 26 uses the flat springs 27 anchored
        in the carriage 17 wheel area 18 also to oppose the tangential
        force. The split contour seal 26 contact point with the housing
        contour wall 12 is off the carriage 17 groove sloped plane for a
        positive pressure contribution. </p>
      <p>For counter-clockwise rotation as a four strokes combustion
        engine, the four chambers are used in a sole circuit and the
        cycle is: intake, compression, expansion, exhaust. One of the
        left upper ports 37, 38 is fitted with a spark plug. The top
        right port 39 is closed with a removable plug 40. Ports 41, 42
        are intakes from a conventional carburetor or must be fitted
        with a gas or diesel injector. Exhaust is expelled at ports 43,
        44. In order to pass along the flame and make a continuous
        combustion engine, a small channel 36, located along the
        internal housing contour wall 12 next to the spark plug 35 at
        port 37, allows a voluntary flow back of hot gas into the next
        ready-to-fire combustion chamber when each of the contour seals
        24, 25, 26 passes over 36. The amount of flow can be controlled
        by screwing or unscrewing the spark plug 35. This channel 36 is
        called the ignition transfer cavity or slot, and permits
        continuous combustion like in a turbine engine and in the same
        time generates a dynamically enhanced compression ratio in the
        almost ready-to-fire combustion chamber, allowing for a more
        complete and faster combustion. Furthermore, the four housing
        contour seals 24, 25, 26 are at variable distances during
        rotation, such as to permit an additional geometric volume
        pressure enhancement. The additional compression may lead to
        desirable or not photo detonation (kicking) and diesel pressure
        level when a diesel injector is located at spark plug 35
        positions 37 and/or 38. In the ports 38 of the side cover 21,
        22, the spark plug cavity is made large enough to withhold a
        small quantity of hot gas until the next ready to fire mixture
        comes up, which does allow for continuous combustion but without
        the dynamically enhanced compression ratio. Lateral ports 38,
        42, 44 of the side cover 21, 22 offer better air-tight
        conditions while crossing in front of the ports due to the large
        carriage 17 lateral surface. An ignition timing advance can be
        built-in by slightly shifting the effective position of the
        spark plug 35 and/or the channel location 36. By blowing high
        pressurized air into the spark plug holes 37, 38 or into the
        ignition transfer cavity 36, the rotor accelerates until the
        self-starting point is reached. No synchronization of the sparks
        is required, and continuous high-frequency sparks or glow plug
        do. The exhaust in the side covers 21, 22 is progressive through
        a long arc port 44 which could allow, by flowing early exhaust
        through a standard Venturi, to produce a depression helping the
        late exhaust cleanup. This rotary engine 10 can also run as two
        parallel two strokes engine circuits, compression-expansion and
        compression-expansion, by blowing the exhaust with an intake
        mixture available from an external blower as in the conventional
        multi pistons two strokes engines. </p>
      <p>As an additional feature, this rotary engine 10 requires few
        parts compared to a piston engine. Due to the continuous
        combustion and to its self-synchronized capability, this engine
        10 is suitable for applications where high reliability is
        required. Average angular rotation speed of each pivot 16 (back
        and forth) of the pivoting blade 13 is about one third of the
        central shaft 32 RPM, while carriage wheels 18 rotate at 6 times
        the central shaft 32 RPM. This engine 10 central shaft 32
        rotates at only a fraction of the maximum RPM of a piston engine
        except in detonation mode, with an idle under 200 RPM. Having a
        much better torque continuity than the piston engine, this
        engine 10 does require less flywheel effect and less gear box
        ratio for most applications. </p>
      <p>To help cooling and reduce lubrication, at least one of the
        lateral side covers 21, 22 has a large central hole 23 exposing
        the pivoting blades 13 central area of the rotor such that all
        parts of the engine 10 are external, except for the carriage 17
        and wheels 18 which are always in good thermal contact with the
        housing contour 12. A simple way to lubricate is to use a
        mixture of fuel and oil even in the four strokes engine mode,
        but more sophisticated applications could incorporate
        pressurized oil distribution systems. Since the seals are the
        only friction surfaces, the need of lubrication is minimized by
        an optimal choice of anti-friction materials. </p>
      <p>Movement of the wheels 18 on the inner housing wall 12 allows
        for heat transfer and distribution to the whole housing 11. The
        pivoting blades 13 are cooled by lateral contact, and by
        ventilating wings (not shown) located toward the central engine
        area. Since this engine 10 does not have any oil pan or inactive
        room, it is suitable for operation in all orientations, and in
        submerged or hostile environments. Furthermore, due to the
        continuous combustion, this engine 10 can be used under water as
        a self contained pump or jet propulsion unit, or in electrically
        conductive environments. </p>
      <p>In addition to the internal combustion engine, this engine 10
        can be used as a compressed fluid pneumatic, steam, or hydraulic
        energy converter motor. The engine 10 then uses the two quasi
        independent symmetrical chamber circuits in parallel, with all
        port plugs 40 removed. For counter-clockwise rotation, intakes
        are housing ports 37, 41 and exits are ports 39, 43. Torque is
        generated symmetrically in the two opposed expansion chambers
        and adds up, and the rotor is almost self-starting. Except when
        ports are in the sides covers 21, 22, the direction of rotation
        can be reversed by reversing the direction of the flow. When
        used as a flow meter, the device 10 also works in both
        directions. Mechanically driven, this fluid energy converter
        motor 10 becomes a compressor, or a pressure or vacuum pump,
        with the same two quasi independent circuits working their own
        cycle. In compressor mode, this device 10 builds up pressure by
        adding four chamber volumes per revolution and per chamber
        circuit, without making use of a limiting check valve, providing
        that some temporary back flow is acceptable. Total pumped volume
        can reach up to 70% of the contour 12 volume per rotation. The
        housing 11, the pivoting blades 13, and the carriages 17 can be
        made of metal, glass, ceramic or plastic, the later mostly for
        compressor, pump or water hydraulic engine applications. </p>
      <p>Calculation of the SAINT-HILAIRE's (from the name of the
        physicist who made the calculation) housing contour family of
        curves 12 is quite complex. To achieve the desired
        characteristics and to distribute stress and constraints on the
        housing 11, a proper selection of distances between wheel axes
        19 (Distw), wheel diameter 18 (Dw) and carriage 17 height (H)
        must be made. At first it is not obvious that such a contour
        exists, particularly a monotone one without lobes, but it does
        in practice within an interesting range of the deformation
        parameters (P) defined as the ratio of the minimum lozenge
        diagonal (LDmin) to the maximum (LDmax). As the rotor rotates,
        pivoting blades 13 align in a square configuration as in FIG. 1
        and in the left arrangement of FIG. 2, with the upper and lower
        chamber at top dead center. At that moment, the two upper and
        lower carriages 17 tend to align themselves almost horizontally.
        The carriages 17 angle (Gsq) with the horizon in the square
        configuration, determines whether or not the rotor will need a
        central bearing support to stabilize lateral motion. To avoid
        the central support, we have selected for the housing contour 12
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a deformation parameter (P) of 0.800,
        which leads to an angle Gsq of 28.00 degrees. For the current
        case (P=0.800), lozenge corner angle varies from 90.000+/-12.680
        degrees. </p>
      <p>A numerical spreadsheet application has been developed to
        calculate the contour family of curves. The method constrains
        the symmetry of the contour 12 only through the central housing
        axis and first calculates the profile (not a contour at this
        stage) of the centers of the carriage wheels 19. Calculations
        start with an approximate profile of the wheel 19 centers and
        calculate the profile 20 of the carriage pivots 16, which is
        imaged through the lozenge transformation into a quality control
        profile 20 of the pivots 16 about 90 degrees out of phase.
        Profile of the wheel centers 19 are then modified by Monte Carlo
        random perturbations method or convergent algorithm, until those
        two calculated profile 20 of the carriage pivots 16 and the
        profile 20 of quality control pivots 16 become identical and in
        coincidence. Close analytic mathematical match of the profile of
        the wheel centers 19 "cw" has been found to be of the following
        form, with three adjustable parameters (A, B, C): </p>
      <p>Where Z is a generating angle, not the actual angle of the
        profile of the wheel centers 19 position. Error using this
        formula does not exceed 0.4%; a second order correction reduces
        this error by almost ten folds. Exact mathematical profiles do
        not exist except for some particular parameters selection. The
        length of the pivoting blade (Lz for lozenge side) is measured

      <p>For P&lt;0.760, the profile 19 of the wheel centers and of the

        mathematically acceptable, but do generate higher stress on the
        rotor. Housing contours 12 have also been calculated for two
        interesting limit cases: </p>
      <p>a) instead of a carriage 17, only one wheel, centered at the
        pivots 16 of the pivoting blades 13 (distance between wheel axes
        Distw=0, and carriage height H=0); and </p>
      <p>b) no wheel at all, meaning that the pivot 16 of the pivoting
        blade 13 are rubbing on the housing contour wall 12 (additional
        constraint of wheel diameter Dw=0). </p>
      <p>These configurations require in practice a central bearing
        support. </p>
      <p>Final housing contour 12 is the profile of the wheel centers 19
        enlarged by a wheel radius (Dw/2) all around, plus the thickness
        of any replaceable sleeve if used. The selection of an optimum
        contour is done for a high radius angular variation rate near
        top dead center, and such as the final expansion volume is near
        the volume generated by the movement of the variable tangential
        surface of push. Those wheel center 19 profiles and housing
        contours 12 generally look like a rounded corner parallelepiped
        with four zones of maximum curvature, or two lobes with six
        zones of maximum curvature at higher eccentricity, and contrary
        to vane devices these contours 12 allow for high-pressure ratio
        without any intake volume reduction. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine (Qurbine in short) uses a rotor arrangement
        peripherally supported by four rolling carriages, the carriages
        taking the pivoting blade pressure-load of the blades forming
        the rotor, and transferring the load to the opposite internal
        contoured housing wall. The present invention discloses a
        central, annular, rotor support for the rotor geometry defined
        by the pivoting blades and associated wheel-bearings, while
        still maintaining the important center-free engine
        characteristic. The pressure-load on each pivoting blade is
        taken by its own set of wheel-bearings rolling on annular tracks
        attached to the central area of the lateral side covers forming
        part of the stator casing. This central, annular, rotor support
        could generally apply to all the family of Quasiturbine rotor
        arrangements and particularly to the limit case here considered,
        where the previous carriage design is replaced by a cylindrical
        pivoting blade joint as presented in the present patent, and for
        which an efficient solution of the five bodies rotary engine
        sealing problem is given. </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to a perfectly balanced, zero
        vibration, rotary device, and specifically to rotary engines,
        compressors, and pressure or vacuum pumps. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b> </p>
      <p>The patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263 discloses a general rotary
        device called the Quasiturbine (Qurbine in short), which uses
        four pivoting blades and four rolling carriages to make a rotor
        of variable diamond-shaped geometry, the rotor mounted within a
        internal contoured housing wall formed along a Saint-Hilaire
        confinement profile shaped somewhat like a skating rink, the
        sides of the internal contoured housing wall closed by lateral
        side covers. That Quasiturbine device uses four peripheral
        rolling carriages to hold the rotor in place within the internal
        contoured housing wall and to transfer the pivoting blade radial
        load-pressure to the opposite part of the internal contoured
        housing wall, in such a manner as to remove all load pressure
        from the center, making the Quasiturbine a center-free engine.
        U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263 also discloses an effective but simple
        rotor-to-shaft differential linking mechanism and further
        provides a general method for the precise calculation of the
        Saint-Hilaire confinement profile family of curves for the
        internal contoured housing wall. In most rotary engines, the
        sealing at the pivot connection or apex between two adjacent
        blades must be done simultaneously with the internal contoured
        housing wall and also with the two lateral side covers which is
        a critical and difficult five-bodies sealing problem. This
        sealing problem was satisfactorily solved in patent U.S. Pat.
        No. 6,164,263 through a male-female pivot design overlapped by
        the carriage. Results of theoretical simulation and some
        experimental data revealed exceptional engine characteristics
        for the Quasiturbine device, and in particular the possibility
        of a shorter pressure pulse with a linear ramp
        compression-pressure raising-falling slope near top dead center.
      </p>
      <p>In the present context, this invention is not an improvement of
        the Quasiturbine device in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263, but instead
        discloses a "central, annular, rotor support" applicable to all
        the family of Quasiturbine rotor arrangements for similar or
        other applications, where pivoting blades, wheel-bearings, and
        annular tracks are located within the rotor, while maintaining a
        center-free engine characteristic for direct power takeoff. To
        illustrate the central, annular, rotor support, an embodiment of
        the Quasiturbine has been used which employs a rotor made up of
        four blades incorporating simple cylindrical pivoting joints
        between adjacent blades without rolling carriages. The pivoting
        joint includes an underneath holding finger at the male end, and
        efficiently solves the five bodies sealing problem. The device
        of the present invention includes wheel-bearings and lateral
        side covers carrying the annular tracks to take the
        pressure-load applied by the blades. The invention also provides
        a precise parametric calculation method and criteria for unique
        selection of the appropriate Saint-Hilaire confinement profile
        so as to satisfy the optimum engine efficiency of the PV
        (Pressure-Volume) diagram; and this geometry permits the
        Quasiturbine to be scaled-up to provide power in excess of 100
        MW and more. This new rotor arrangement further allows the
        insertion of annular power sleeves each linking each pair of two
        opposite blades with or without clutch centrifuge weights, on
        the external surface of the sleeves. A Modulated Inner Rotor
        Volume (MIRV) allows pumping-ventilating action and is
        particularly useful to cool the 90 interior of the rotor in an
        internal combustion engine mode. The MIRV is also generally
        applicable to the Quasiturbine design disclosed in patent U.S.
        Pat. No. 6,164,263. Finally, on the interior wall of the annular
        power sleeve, differential washers make a tangential linking
        with the power disk and shaft. Due to a shorter confinement time
        and a faster linear ramp compression-pressure raising-falling
        slope, a new combined Otto and Diesel QTIC-cycle mode is made
        possible, and is photo-detonation compatible. </p>
      <p>The following rotary engine prior arts, either ignored the need
        or fail to provide the necessary strong mechanism needed to
        withstand the radial high pressure load on the rotor, fail to
        include a differential compensation device to smooth out the
        power shaft RPM from the strong rotational harmonics generated
        by the rotor components variable angular speeds, and none
        consider the most important engine efficiency criteria for
        rejection or selection of the internal contoured housing wall
        among multiple geometric possibilities, which render most of
        those concepts impracticable as such. Finally, none achieved the
        most useful empty center engine characteristics: Okulov (Pub

      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The object of this invention is to provide a Quasiturbine
        central, annular, rotor support using pivoting blades,
        wheel-bearings, and lateral side covers carrying annular tracks
        (or alternatively the canceling out of the pressure-load in the
        fluid energy converter mode through the annular power sleeves)
        generally applicable to all the family of Quasiturbine rotor
        arrangements and other rotary engines, compressors or pumps, and
        particularly to an embodiment of the Quasiturbine which employs
        four blades incorporating simple cylindrical pivoting joints
        between adjacent blades without carriages, all this while
        maintaining a large empty area in the center of the engine for
        direct power takeoff and preserving most previously claimed
        Quasiturbine characteristics. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a "Saint-Hilaire
        confinement profile calculation method" of the internal
        contoured housing wall appropriate to the chosen Quasiturbine
        design arrangement, minimizing the surface to volume ratio in
        the compression chambers and reducing the flow turbulence. This
        calculation method includes criteria for engine optimum
        confinement profile selection from the family of curves to
        generate the internal contoured housing wall. </p>
      <p>A further object of this invention is to provide a low
        friction, pivoting blade, joint design which is particularly
        suitable for non-metallic material like plastic, ceramic or
        glass, the joint allowing for maximum air-tightness; space for
        gate-type, near zero in-groove movement with single or multiple
        contour seals; higher maximum RPM; and suitable for very
        high-pressure applications with the seals designed accordingly.
        A compression ratio tuner can replace the sparkplug in high
        compression ratio photo-detonation combustion engine mode. </p>
      <p>Another further object of this invention is to provide a
        Modulated Inner Rotor Volume (MIRV) producing annular
        pumping-ventilating action between the inner surfaces of the
        moving pivoting blades and the outer surfaces of the annular
        power sleeves, with or without clutch centrifuge weights. The
        Modulated Inner Rotor Volume (MIRV) is particularly useful to
        cool the interior of the rotor in an internal combustion engine
        mode, while allowing for the insertion of the differential
        washers on the inner surface of the annular power sleeves,
        making a tangential linking with the power disk and shaft. </p>
      <p>Yet another further object of this invention is to provide a
        new combined Otto and Diesel Quasiturbine operation in an
        Internal Combustion QTIC-cycle mode, this due to the possible
        shorter confinement time and the faster linear ramp
        compression-pressure raising-falling slope, which is photo
        detonation compatible. </p>
      <p>In order to achieve these objects, the Quasiturbine rotor
        arrangement makes use of an appropriate internal contoured
        housing wall calculated to receive the present, pivoting blades,
        rotor geometry, with a set of contour and lateral seals (linear
        gate type and pellets) engineered for the selected rotor
        arrangement. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>The U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263 patent disclosed a Quasiturbine
        rotor arrangement using four rolling carriages to take the
        pivoting blade pressure-load and transfer it to the opposite
        internal contoured housing wall. The present invention discloses
        a Quasiturbine rotor arrangement without carriages, where the
        pressure-load on each pivoting blade is taken by its own set of
        wheel-bearings located in a power transfer slot in the inner
        side of blade, the wheel-bearings rolling on annular tracks, one
        track attached to the central area of each lateral side cover.
        This rotor supporting configuration can apply to all the
        Quasiturbine family of designs, and is here illustrated on a
        specific Quasiturbine embodiment without rolling carriages. This
        Quasiturbine rotor arrangement reduces the number of components,
        reduces the friction surface, reduces the total wall surface in
        the compression chambers, and is particularly suitable for
        non-metallic pivoting blades, the blades being made instead from
        material such as plastic, ceramic or glass. Furthermore, this
        rotor arrangement allows for single or multiple contour seals
        with a near zero in-groove movement, and eliminates the need of
        a cooling system for carriages. This invention applies generally
        to rotary engines, compressors, or pressured or vacuum pumps. </p>
      <p>The present Quasiturbine invention is generally referred on
        FIG. 1 as number 10, and comprises a stator casing 12 made of a
        internal contoured housing wall 14 and two lateral side covers
        16, one on each side of the internal contoured housing wall 14,
        and a rotor 18 of four or more pivoting blades 20 confined
        within this casing. Each pivoting blade 20 carries a power
        transfer slot 22 on its inner surface 24 in which wheel-bearings
        26 are located. The lateral side covers 16 each have an annular
        track 28, not necessarily circular, on their inner surface 30 to
        support the wheel-bearings 26 carried by the pivoting blades 20,
        the wheel-bearings rolling on the tracks. Multiple notches 32
        are provided on the external perimeter of the covers 16 where
        cooling fins 34 can be inserted. Liquid cooling is also easily
        feasible. Radial intake 36 and exhaust 38 ports are located in
        the internal contoured housing wall 14, or axial ports 126, 128,
        130, 132 in the lateral side covers 16. In combustion mode, the
        alternate lateral sparkplug or compression ratio tuner is screw
        in port 128, which position can be moved angularly to permit
        proper timing. Intake and exhaust ports may have different
        angular locations for different applications as seen by
        comparing positioning of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. A check-valve port
        40 can be located through each pivoting blade 20 to benefit from
        the centrifuge intake pressure. A compression ratio tuner 42 can
        replace the sparkplug 44 at high compression ratio
        photo-detonation mode. </p>
      <p>One end of each pivoting blade 20 carries a male connector 46
        and the other end carries a complementary female connector 48,
        the male and female connectors of adjacent blades connected to
        provide a low friction pivot joint 50 as shown in FIG. 2. The
        cylindrical male connector 46 carries a contour seal groove 52
        and has a rounded outer portion that acts as a guiding-rubbing
        pad 54 with the internal contoured housing wall 14, with
        provision for a hard metal or ceramic insert in that
        guiding-rubbing area. The pivoting blades 20 also have a lateral
        pellet hole 56 in the male connector 46 at the joints 50, and
        lateral seal grooves 58 along their sides extending between the
        connectors 4648. The set of seals used in the pivoting blades is
        made up of contour seals 60; linear or slightly curved gate-type
        lateral seal 62 (which can be made continuous when located in a
        groove within the lateral side covers 16), and small pellet
        seals 64 in the male connector 46 at the pivoting blade joint
        50. All the seals have a back spring, and in addition the
        contour seal 60 sits on a contour seal damper made of a rubber
        band lying in the bottom of its groove to help extend the seal
        life from hammering against the internal contoured housing wall.
      </p>
      <p>Two annular power sleeves 66, 68 are provided, as shown in FIG.
        3, each linked to the axels 70 of the wheel-bearings 26 in two
        opposed pivoting blade power transfer slots 22 by opposed rings
        72 on each sleeve. The sleeves 66, 68 leave a large circular
        hole in the engine center for the shaft power disk, a direct
        power takeoff or other uses. The annular power sleeves 66, 68
        can carry their own set of lateral side cover seals (not shown)
        to insulate their inward central area from their outward area.
        Furthermore, the inner surface 74 of the annular power sleeves
        66, 68 carries several grooves 76 from which any mechanism
        enclosed by the sleeves can be driven. Clutch centrifuge weights
        78 are located between the inner surface 24 of the pivoting
        blades 20 and the outer surface 80 of the annular power sleeves
        66, 68, a clutch centrifuge weight 78 located adjacent each side
        of each of the power transfer slots 22. A tangential linking on
        the inner surface 74 of the annular power sleeves 66, 68 is made
        of several (from two to twelve or more) differential washers 82
        linking the annular power sleeves 66, 68 to the central power
        disk 84 and the shaft 86. A calculation method for the stator
        casing Saint-Hilaire confinement profile of the internal
        contoured housing wall 14 is disclosed for the chosen
        Quasiturbine rotor arrangement, with a set of optimum engine
        internal contoured housing wall 14 selection criteria </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> shows the four interconnected pivoting blades 20
        in a square configuration within the internal contoured housing
        wall 14, guided by the solid guiding-rubbing pads 54 provided by
        the male connectors 46 at the joints 50 between adjacent blades.
        The wheel-bearings 26 of the blades 20 roll on the annular
        tracks 28 carried by the lateral side covers 16. The port
        locations 36, 38 shown are the ones used when the Quasiturbine
        is operated as a fluid energy converter or compressor. The spark
        plug 44 is positioned as for the internal combustion mode. For
        clarity, the clutch centrifuge weights 78 are not shown on FIG.
        1. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 2</b> shows the four interconnected pivoting blades 20
        in a diamond configuration. FIG. 2 also shows details of the
        interconnecting pivot joint 50 including details of the male 46
        and female 48 connectors; the contour 60 and lateral arched
        seals 62 and pellet seal 64; the wheel-bearings 26 and annular
        track 28 positioning; and the guiding-rubbing action of the pad
        54 in the cylindrical male joints 50. The compression ratio
        tuner 42, the flame transfer slot-cavity 88 and one of the
        pivoting blade check valve ports 40 with the central area are
        shown. The port locations 36, 38 shown in FIG. 2 are the ones
        used when the Quasiturbine is operated in an internal combustion
        engine mode with counterclockwise direction of rotation. FIG. 2
        also shows the Modulated Inner Rotor Volumes (MIRV) 90. Annular
        pumping action is provided by the varying size of the volumes
        90, each located in between the inner surface 24 of the pivoting
        blades 20 and the outer surface 80 of the annular power sleeves
        66, 68. It will be seen that the clutch centrifuge weights 78
        are located within the volumes 90 and move along the outer
        surface 80 of the power sleeves 66, 68. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 3</b> shows details of the Quasiturbine with the
        internal contoured housing wall 14 and two of the pivoting
        blades 20 removed. It also shows details of the clutch
        centrifuge weights 78, which weights could possibly pivot around
        the closest wheel-bearings, the annular power sleeves 66, 68 and
        the differential washers 82 making a tangential linking with the
        power disk 84 and shaft 86. </p>
      <p>The four pivoting blades 20 are attached to one another as a
        chain in forming the rotor 18 and show a variable diamond-shaped
        geometry while moving in a Saint-Hilaire-like confinement
        profile of the internal contoured housing wall 14 calculated to
        confine the rotor 18 at all angles of rotation. Contour seals 60
        between the pivoting blades 20 and the internal contoured
        housing wall 14 are located at each pivot joint 50. The
        expansion or combustion chamber 92 is defined by the volume
        in-between the outer surface 94 of a pivoting blade 20 and the
        inner surface 96 of the internal contoured housing wall 14 and
        extends from one pivot joint contour seal 60 to the next.
        Referring to FIG. 2, as the rotor 18 turns, it does make minimum
        combustion chamber 92 volumes at the top and bottom (TDC), and
        maximum volumes at left and right (BTC). During one rotation,
        each pivoting blade 20 goes through four complete engine
        strokes, so that a total of sixteen strokes are completed in
        every rotation. Furthermore, as an expansion stroke starts from
        a horizontal pivoting blade 20 and ends when it gets vertical,
        the next following pivoting blade 20 is immediately starting a
        new expansion cycle without any dead time, which means that the
        Quasiturbine is a quasi-continuous flow engine at intake and
        exhaust, both of which can be located either radially in the
        internal contoured housing wall 14 or axially in the lateral
        side covers 16. Several removable intake and exhaust plugs 98
        may be used to convert the two parallel compression and
        expansion circuits into a sole serial circuit. The two
        quasi-independent circuits are used in parallel with all plugs
        removed, for operation as a two stroke internal combustion
        engine, fluid energy converter, compressor, vacuum pump and flow
        meter. The two quasi-independent circuits are used in serial by
        plugging intermediate ports, to make a four stroke internal
        combustion engine as shown in the port arrangement of FIG. 2.
        Notice that the intake and exhaust ports have different
        locations for different applications and their position can be
        time advanced or delayed for exhaust and intake as shown in FIG.
        2. The load-pressure force exercised by the compressed fluids on
        each pivoting blade 20 is taken by the wheel-bearings 26 rolling
        on the annular tracks 28 attached to their respective lateral
        side covers 16. With this geometrical arrangement, even with
        heavy pressure-loads on the pivoting blades 20, the
        diamond-shaped deformation of the rotor 18 requires only very
        little energy, and the rubbing pads 54 located in the vicinity
        of the pivot joints 50 and contour seals 60 guide the rotor 18
        during its diamond-shaped deformation. During rotation, the
        wheel-bearings axels 70 are not moving at a constant angular
        velocity and for this reason, a differential linkage must be
        built within the annular power sleeves 66, 68 to drive the power
        disk 84 and shaft 86 at constant angular velocity. </p>
      <p>The stator casing 12 and the lateral side covers 16 are
        centered on the engine rotor axis. The lateral side covers 16
        have annular tracks 28 receiving the wheel-bearings 26 carried
        by the blades 20, which tracks are not necessarily circular.
        FIG. 1 shows a central hole 100 in the lateral side covers 16
        that can be made large enough so that the power disk 84 and the
        differential washers 82 can be slide in-and-out without having
        to dismantle the engine. A cap bearing-holder can be inserted in
        the large side cover hole 100. Intake and exhaust ports 36, 38
        are located either radially in the stator casing 12 or axially
        (not shown) in the lateral side covers 16. For the Modulated
        Inner Rotor Volume (MIRV) 90, the lateral, side covers 16 carry
        a set of ventilation ports 102 for cooling the rotor 18. A
        sparkplug 44 can be located at a variable angle on the top of
        the stator casing 12, and also at bottom (not shown) in the two
        stroke engine mode, and replaced, when in a very high
        compression ratio photo-detonation mode by a small threaded
        piston called a "compression ratio tuner" 42, which can be
        feedback controlled to optimize combustion chamber conditions
        for different fuels or running operation. The surface of contact
        between the stator casing 12 and the lateral side covers 16
        carry a fix gasket 104. </p>
      <p>The annular tracks 28 are circular only if the wheel-bearings
        26 are on the line joining the axis of two successive blade
        pivots. The central opening in the rotor 18 could be made
        smaller or larger by moving the wheel-bearings 26 towards or
        away of the outer surface 94 of the pivoting blades 20, out of
        alignment with pivot joints 50, but then the annular track 28 in
        the side covers 16 will no longer be a perfect circle, but be
        elliptical-like in shape. The wheel-bearings 26 are located on
        each side of the pivoting blade 20 and carry roller or needle
        bearings 106. The blade rubbing pads 54, located in the vicinity
        of the contour seals 60, can be formed by the pivoting blade
        male connector 46 itself, or it can be formed by a little insert
        (not shown) containing the contour seal 60 so as to prevent the
        hardening of the whole pivoting blade 20. In this arrangement,
        hard inserts can, alternatively, be used to make the complete
        pivoting blade joint 50. Pressure in the combustion chamber 92
        does not generate a significant torque around the wheel-bearings
        axles 70 carried by the pivoting blades 20 and consequently the
        combustion chamber pressure has little effect on the rubbing pad
        54 pressure against the internal contoured housing wall 14. The
        rubbing pad pressure is essentially due to the small rotor
        deformation, which is quite independent of the pressure-load.
        However, this same pressure-load gives a great tangential
        rotational force on the whole rotor. The combustion chamber 92
        can be enlarged by cutting the pivoting blade 20 and the very
        high compression ratio photo-detonation mode makes use of a
        "compression ratio tuner" 42 instead of a sparkplug 44. The
        manufacturing method allows for the entire stator casing and
        rotor to be made out of a cylindrical disk, the internal
        contoured housing wall being formed in the interior of the disk
        and the pivoting blades being formed in the outer periphery.
        Alternatively, the internal contoured housing wall 14 can be
        shaped by precision forging and the pivoting blades 20 can be
        metal cast or metal powder pressed. Similar techniques and molds
        will also work for plastic or ceramic. </p>
      <p>The pivoting blades 20 can be made all alike with a male
        connector 46 and a female connector 48 to form the pivot joints
        50. Alternatively, half the blades 20 can have two female
        connectors and the other half two male connectors. A good
        "five-bodies" sealed joint design is quite important and must
        satisfy an extensive force vector analysis. The blade pivot
        joint 50 of the present invention must be strong enough to take
        some load-pressure and all the tangential push-and-pull forces
        of the torque, while allowing independent low-friction
        rotational movement of the two connected pivoting blades 20.
        Simultaneously, the joint must be leak proof within itself, the
        internal contoured housing wall 14 and with the two lateral side
        covers 16. This pivot joint 50 has space, if needed, to enclose
        a bearing to further reduce the required rotor energy
        deformation. Extensive research has led to a double chisel joint
        pivot concept detailed on FIG. 2, where the male connector 46
        has two different contact surfaces 124, 108 of corresponding
        radii on its main body 110 and a finger 112 spaced from the main
        body 110 for use in holding the pivoting blades together. The
        female connector 48 has also two different surfaces 114, 116 of
        corresponding radii located on an extending arm 122, the radii
        surface 114, 116 cooperating with the radii surface 124, 108 on
        the male connector 46 when the arm 122 is mounted between the
        main body 10 and the finger 112, and preventing the connectors
        46, 48 from opening up. As the rotor torque increases, the
        joints 50 get tighter and tighter, and still more leak proof. </p>
      <p>The contour seals 60 are single or multi-pieces drawer type
        seals located in the axial direction along the pivoting blade
        male connector 46 and have a near zero in-groove displacement,
        making a contact angle almost perpendicular to the internal
        contoured housing wall 14 at all times, departing only slightly
        from -6,35 to +6,35 degrees for the selected arrangement.
        Consecutive multiple pieces contour seals (not shown) can be
        used to prevent two successive chambers to be in contact with
        one another at the time the joint 50 passes in front of the
        ports 36, 38. This multi-seals configuration would also insure
        that at least one of the seals is at all times moving inward in
        its groove, while the others may be moving outward. In addition,
        the contour seal sits on a contour seal damper made of a rubber
        band lying in the bottom of its groove 52 or between the springs
        to help extend the seal life from hammering against the internal
        contoured housing wall. The pivoting blades 20 seal with the
        lateral side covers 16, on each side, by a linear or slightly
        curved gate-type lateral seal 62 and a pellet type seal 64 at
        the end of the male connector 46. The seal grooves are at
        different depth levels, so that the pressure gas behind the
        seals cannot propagate. A non-mandatory linear intra-pivot seal
        can be incorporated in the female connector 48 from one lateral
        side cover to the other, if required. When the pivoting blades
        20 are made of smooth or fragile material like plastic, ceramic
        or glass, there is room for a metal insert to be placed at each
        pivoting blade joint 50 for proper movement and friction
        control. When shaped as an arc, the pivoting blade lateral seal
        grooves 58 are easy to make on a lathe. This arched seal,
        positioned near the edge of the outer surface of the pivoting
        blade 20 traps a minimum volume in combustion mode, and being at
        the far reach of the rotor, it keeps the high-pressure in the
        outer area of the covers 16, which reduces the total
        pressure-force on them. A continuous elliptical-like seal,
        shaped like a slightly shrunken confinement internal contoured
        housing wall profile, and incorporated into the lateral side
        covers 16 is also a simple alternative to the multi-components
        lateral seal set described. All seals 60, 62, 64 have a back
        spring to maintain them at all time respectively in contact with
        the internal contoured housing wall 14 and the lateral side
        covers 16. The low-friction wheel-bearings 26, the pivot joint
        50 design, and the described seal set, allow the Quasiturbine to
        withstand high-pressure-load, while maintaining an excellent
        leak proof condition. </p>
      <p>Many Quasiturbines may benefit in having some type of
        centrifuge clutches. The Quasiturbine geometry permits it to
        have the clutch centrifuge weights 78 within the rotor 18, each
        weight located between the wheel-bearings 26 and a blade end,
        in-between the pivoting blades 20 and the outer surface 80 of
        the annular power sleeves 66, 68 within the volumes 90 well
        ventilated by the Modulated Inner Rotor Volume (MIRV) annular
        central pump effect. The clutch centrifuge weights 78 can pivot
        around the wheel-bearings axis 70. As with any centrifuge
        clutches, the weights 78 will contribute slightly to increase
        the rotor inertia. The clutch centrifuge weights 78 can be used
        to drive clutch friction pads (not shown) located either on the
        outer surface 80 of the annular power sleeves 66, 68; or within
        the power disk 84 where the angular rotational speed is uniform;
        or externally to the Quasiturbine. Notice that with such a
        centrifuge clutch in place, a conventional starter must be used
        to drive the Quasiturbine rotor and not the power shaft 86,
        unless some kind of clutch-locking is provided. </p>
      <p>Because each pair of opposed wheel-bearings 26 does not rotate
        at constant angular velocity, two 400 distinct but identical
        central annular power sleeves 66, 68 are used side-by-side along
        the engine axis as shown on FIG. 3, each one linking two
        different opposite wheel-bearings axis 70 by opposed rings 72.
        Each annular power sleeve 66, 68 is in the form of an annular
        ring with the two outer opposed rings 72 on the outer surface 80
        taking the torque from the opposite pivoting blades 20 via the
        wheel-bearings axis 70. As an alternative of the two outer
        opposed mounting rings 72 on the annular power sleeves 66, 68,
        conventional centrifuge clutch pads (not shown) linked to the
        centrifuge weights 78 could be inserted between the two
        consecutive wheel-bearings 26 and the outer surface 80 of the
        annular power sleeves 66, 68. Inside the annular sleeves 66, 68
        are multiple grooves 76 in the inner surface 74 in which the
        differential washers 82 can be attached, via washer pins 118
        thereon. The differential washers 82 are rotably attached to the
        surface of the power disk 84 via power disk pins 120 to link the
        power disk 84, via an oscillating movement of the washers 82
        around the power disk pins 120, to the power sleeves 66, 68. In
        the design shown, the maximum relative angular variation of the
        annular power sleeves 66, 68 is 6.35 degrees ahead and behind
        their respective average angular position, for a maximum
        differential angle of 12.7 degrees, which produces a +/-15
        degrees oscillation of the differential washers 82. In the case
        of the pressurized fluid energy converter mode, like pneumatic
        or steam, where both the upper and lower chambers are
        symmetrically pressurized, the annular power sleeves 66, 68 can
        take and cancel out the mutual pressure-load of the two opposite
        pivoting blades 20, possibly suppressing in this case the need
        to use the wheel-bearings 26 and the lateral side cover annular
        tracks 28. </p>
      <p>To power the shaft 86 by the two side-by-side annular power
        sleeves 66, 68, the shaft power disk 84 or the large diameter
        shaft have multiple radial extending disk pins 120 on which sits
        the set of differential washers 82. Each differential washer 82
        has two opposite radially extending washer pins 118, each one
        fitting into its own internal groove 76 on power sleeve 66, 68
        respectively. The thicker, or wider, that the Quasiturbine
        design is, the greater can be the diameter of the differential
        washers 82, however, fewer differential washers can be setup on
        the circumference of the power disk 84, except if one accepts a
        partial overlapping, which is well possible. Practically, the
        numbers of differential washers 82, the number of power disk
        pins 120 and the corresponding grooves 76 in the power sleeves
        66, 68 can vary from two to twelve or more. In the design shown,
        the differential washers 82 angular oscillation around the disk
        pin 120 is +/-15 degrees, which requires a little play between
        the power disk 84 and the internal surface 74 of the annular
        power sleeves 66, 68 to account for the differential washer
        being slightly off shaft axis during oscillation. Alternatively,
        if the power disk 84 external surface is shaped as part of a
        sphere of the same diameter, the differential washer 82 can sit
        perfectly on it if also shaped accordingly and furthermore,
        since the washer pins 118 on the differential washers 82 need to
        be cylindrical only on a 15 degree arc, the two pins shape can
        be elongated toward the washer center for better strength. Each
        radially extending disk pin 120 can be part of the differential
        washer itself, and can carry a bearing. This set of differential
        washers 82 makes a tangential linking between the two annular
        power sleeves 66, 68 and the unique power disk 84, and
        suppresses the rotational harmonic for a constant and uniform
        rotational speed of the output shaft. Another differential
        design is presented in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263, and most other
        conventional differential designs can work, but the above
        described tangential linking design is more convenient because
        it works at a high radius, where the torque-force is minimal; it
        takes up little space; and it leaves a large central-free engine
        area for power take-off. Furthermore, it allows the large shaft
        diameter or the power disk-shaft 8486 assembly to slide
        in-and-out of the Quasiturbine engine without it being
        disassembled. Like for the Quasiturbine rotor, this differential
        design has a fixed center of gravity during rotation and
        maintains the zero vibration engine characteristics. The power
        disk can hold a conventional feed-through shaft, or can carry,
        or be part of, a very large diameter thin wall tube shaft. This
        tube shaft may enclose a propeller screw for a water jet or
        pumping, or an electrical generator or else. It can also carry
        an axial thrust bearing at least at one end, and an engine crank
        starting device at either ends. </p>
      <p>Each Modulated Inner Rotor Volume (MIRV) 90 is generally
        triangular in shape, each volume formed by the inner surfaces 24
        of adjacent pivoting blades 20 extending from their common pivot
        50 to their respective transfer slots 22 and the outer surface
        80 of the annular power sleeves 66, 68. The volumes 90 vary as
        the rotor 18 rotates. The volumes 90 are forty five degrees out
        of phase with the outer combustion chambers 92, and make an
        integrated efficient annular pump or ventilating device,
        displacing a total of 8 times its volume in every rotation.
        Ventilating ports 102 are located in the lateral side covers 16
        near the external surface of the annular track 28 in the
        vicinity of the wheel-bearings 26 when the rotor is in its
        maximum diamond length configuration. The geometry permits
        pulsing ventilation if all the ventilating ports 102 in the
        lateral side covers 16 are open, or two different one-way
        ventilation circuits in the same or opposed axial direction, if
        proper ventilation ports 102 are selected on both sides of the
        engine. When the side covers 16 have only a
        crossed-symmetrical-through-center set of ventilation ports 102,
        as shown in FIG. 1, entrances occur only from one engine side
        and exits to the other, while consecutive ports on the same side
        covers would make the entrances and exits on the same engine
        side. Using a radial check valve 40 across and through the
        pivoting blade body could allow transfer to-and-from the
        chambers with the central area, which may be of interest for
        example in the Quasiturbine-Stirling-Steam engine, compressor,
        or enhanced mixture intake by the gas centrifuge force through
        the central engine area. The Modulated Inner Rotor Volumes
        (MIRV) 90 forms a well-integrated annular pump and can be used
        as such in many applications, or to ventilate and cool the rotor
        in engine mode. They can also form a second stage low flow
        high-pressure device when in compressor mode, or to provide the
        pressure fluctuation required by a standard carburetor diaphragm
        fuel pump. Furthermore, a very high-pressure can be obtained
        from the scissor-pivoting-blade effect at the joint 50 when the
        guiding male finger 112 moves in and out of position. Similarly,
        other piston-like devices can be incorporated in this scissor
        action to produce high-pressure pumping effect like a Diesel
        fuel pump to drive the fuel injectors. Ultimately, the Modulated
        Inner Rotor Volumes (MIRV) 90 can also be made to work as an
        Inward Rotor Engine Quasiturbine (IREQ), while the Quasiturbine
        outward rotor is used as a compressor, a pump, or for other
        applications. </p>
      <p>A new Quasiturbine Internal Combustion QTIC-cycle mode is made
        possible, combining Otto, Diesel and eventually photo-detonation
        mode. Otto engine cycle intakes and compresses a sub-atmospheric
        manifold pressure air-mixture for uniform combustion, while the
        Diesel engine cycle always intakes and compresses atmospheric
        pressure air-only, which gives a non-uniform injected fuel
        combustion. Due to the possibility of a shorter confinement time
        and a faster linear ramp compression-pressure raising-falling
        slope, the new Quasiturbine Internal Combustion QTIC-cycle mode
        consists of intaking, at atmospheric pressure, a continuous
        air-fuel mixture for uniform combustion, thereby combining Otto
        and Diesel modes. This mode is not possible with a piston
        engine, because the sine-wave shape of the maximum compression
        ratio poorly defines the top dead center by making an
        unnecessary long confinement time, consequently requiring a
        reliable external trigger source such as a sparkplug or a fuel
        injector. The Quasiturbine Internal Combustion QTIC-cycle can
        work at a moderate compression ratio with a sparkplug 44, or
        without it at a very high compression ratio for almost any fuel,
        the photo-detonation being auto synchronized by its very short
        linear ramp pressure pulse tip. A regular piston cannot stand
        photo-detonation because it keeps the mixture confined too long,
        and because the relatively small piston mass required by the
        severe accelerations at both strokes ends prevent making a
        stronger piston. The upward piston momentum aggravates the
        effect of knocking, while the homo-kinetic rotation of the
        Quasiturbine allows for relatively more massive pivoting blades
        making the passage at top dead center almost without momentum
        change. This QTIC-cycle mode only requires a non-synchronized
        fuel pulverization and vaporization in the Quasiturbine
        atmospheric intake continuous airflow, suppressing the need of
        conventional vacuum carburetor or synchronized fuel injector and
        sparkplug timing in photo-detonation mode, and allows for a much
        higher RPM than the conventional mode due to continuous intake
        flow without valve obstruction and faster photo-detonation
        chemistry combustion. The photo-detonation being a fast
        radiative volumetric combustion, it leaves much less unburnt
        hydrocarbon that has plenty of extra time left for completing
        the combustion. Furthermore, due to the possibility of shorter
        confinement time, the combustion chemistry does not have enough
        time-pressure to produce the NO.sub.x before expansion begins,
        producing a cleaner exhaust, including with the hot hydrogen
        combustion in presence of nitrogen. Because of the zero dead
        time, the Quasiturbine can provide continuous combustion by
        using an ignition transfer slot-cavity 88 cut into the internal
        contoured housing wall 14 for flame transfer from one chamber to
        the following one. This ignition flame transfer slot-cavity 88
        also allows the injection of high-pressure hot burning gas into
        the following, ready-to-fire, chamber, producing a dynamically
        enhanced compression ratio, since near top dead center, a little
        volume change in the combustion chamber makes a large change in
        the compression ratio. For better multi-fuel capability, a
        compression ratio tuner 42 made of a simple small threaded
        piston in a tube is used in place of the sparkplug 44, and
        allows compression ratio fine-tuning as needed, and can be
        dynamically feedback controlled. </p>
      <p>The Quasiturbine can be generally used as an engine, compressor
        or pump, and sometimes in a dual mode. To name a few
        applications, it is suitable for small or very large units in
        steam, pneumatic and hydraulic mode (including use in reversible
        waterfall hydroelectric stations), and in a combined
        engine-turbo-pump mode where one intake port and its
        corresponding exhaust port are used in a compressed fluid energy
        converter engine mode while the other intake and exhaust ports
        can be used as a positive or vacuum pump or compressor. The
        Quasiturbine can be used as an internal combustion engine in
        Otto or Diesel in two or four stroke mode. The Quasiturbine
        engines in photo-detonation mode with a high compression ratio
        (20 to 30:1) are particularly suitable for natural gas and other
        fuels that are hard to burn to environmental standards like jet
        fuel or low specific energy gases, in which case the fuel is
        simply mixed to the atmospheric pressure intake without any
        synchronization means. It can be further used in a continuous
        combustion mode with a flame transfer cavity 88 at the forward
        contour seal 60 near top dead center. It can be used in a
        Quasiturbine-Stirling-Steam rotary engine mode with pressurized
        gas or phase change liquid-steam, with the hot poles alternating
        with the cold poles, a device which is reversible and can be
        used as a heat pump. Most of the previous engine modes allow
        operation without a sparkplug (no electromagnetic field), with a
        plastic or ceramic engine bloc and with low noise level, all
        qualities most suitable for low signature stealth military
        operation. Furthermore, those previous modes permit very energy
        efficient operation and more complete internal combustion than
        conventional piston engines to meet the most severe
        environmental standards of the future. The Quasiturbine can also
        be used as an engine to drive a turbo-jet engine-compressor,
        allowing the suppression of the hot-power-turbine and its
        associated limitations in temperature, efficiency and speed. In
        the opened or closed Brayton mode, a cold Quasiturbine can act
        as compressor while a second hot Quasiturbine possibly on the
        same shaft can produce power in a pneumatic mode, in order to
        make a jet engine without jet (no gas kinetic energy
        intermediary transformation is involved, which makes it almost
        insensitive to dust particles). The second hot Quasiturbine can
        be suppressed and the system used as a high flow hot gas
        generator. It can be used in a vacuum engine mode, including
        with imploding Brown gas. Many applications do not require the
        Quasiturbine to have its own power disk 84 and/or shaft 86,
        since the shaft attachment differential washers 82 can be fixed
        directly on the accessory shaft (of a generator, a gearbox, a
        differential shaft, by way of example) and the Quasiturbine
        simply slides over the accessory shaft to mount it without any
        need for shaft alignment. The empty center of the Quasiturbine
        is particularly suitable to locate a propeller therein and makes
        a self-integrated marine jet propulsion system, or a liquid or
        gas turbine-like pump, where the complete engine can be
        submerged. This empty center is also suitable to locate
        electrical components for a lightweight compact electrical
        generator or electrical motor for a compressor or pump. The fast
        acceleration resulting from the absence of the flywheel and the
        high engine specific power density allows the use of the engine
        in strategic applications, as in heavy load soft landing
        parachuting. Improved engine intake characteristics allow the
        Quasiturbine to run better than piston engines in rarefied-air
        as in high altitude airplane operation. Its low sensitivity to
        photo-detonation and potentially oil-free operation make it most
        suitable for hydrogen fuel operation, including with lateral
        intake stratification and natural atmospheric aspiration. Since
        the Quasiturbine has no oil pan and does not require gravity oil
        collection, it can run in all possible orientations, and even
        out in space in micro-gravity. The Quasiturbine has a favorable
        geometry where lubricant is not needed for cooling, where no
        internal parallax forces exist, and where no seal is under
        internal stress and subject to hydrogen fragilisation. Several
        Quasiturbines in different modes can be stacked side-by-side on
        a single common power shaft through simple ratchet coupling for
        torque addition. The Quasiturbine can also be used as a general
        replacement engine, compressor or pump in most present and
        future applications, and with most principles or processes where
        modulated volume is required. </p>
      <p>The internal contoured housing wall 14 is derivate from an
        empirical generating equation of the variable diamond geometry
        of the rotor for all rotation angles. The internal contoured
        housing wall 14 is not unique but part of a family of curves,
        and selection must be done according to an engine efficiency
        criteria. Before calculating the Saint-Hilaire confinement
        profile for the internal contoured housing wall 14, one must
        calculate the blade pivots joint 50 profile curve. Since this
        profile does require only symmetry across the central engine
        axis, any initial arbitrary pivot movement from 0 to 45 degrees
        (or 1/8 of a turn in a non-orthogonal axis situation) does
        determine the complete pivot point curve. This empirical 0 to 45
        degree curve must meet three constraints: be parallel to the
        y-axis at 0 degree angle x-crossing; be matching at the
        diamond-square configuration corners; and furthermore, the slope
        at those corners must be continuous. Assuming Rx the pivot
        profile radius on the x-axis, and Ry the pivot profile radius on
        y-axis, and R45 the pivot profile radius at 45 degrees where the
        rotor is in square configuration, the modified M(.theta.) linear
        radius variation between 0 and 45 degree could be empirically of
        the form (pivot profile, not the actual internal contoured
        housing wall 14): </p>
      <p>Where the modifying parametric function M(.theta.) has the
        form: </p>
      <p>The pivot profile in the 45 (R45) to 90 (Ry) degrees interval
        is simply given by the Pythagoras diamond-lozenge formula. The
        two constants A and P provide a parametric adjustment of the
        radius variation where +/- A controls the amplitude and affects
        mostly the axis areas, and +/-P controls the angular maximum
        variation position and affects the wideness of the overlap zone
        near 45 degree from the x- axis. This empirical representation
        has been found adequate to explore most of the family of pivot
        profiles of interest, including the very high eccentricities
        leading to two lobes confinement profiles. The internal
        contoured housing wall 14 presented in FIGS. 1 and 2 is obtained
        from the pivot concave eccentricity limit profile curve, enlarge
        by the rubbing pad 54 radius all around. This enlargement must
        be perpendicular to the local pivot profile tangency at all
        angles. Furthermore, in order for the engine to be described by
        the most efficient Pressure-Volume PV diagram, the final
        expansion volume of the engine chamber must be equal to the
        volume generated by the variable surface of tangential push,
        which is proportional to the radius difference of two successive
        contour seal 60 positions during rotation. These criteria permit
        to select a subfamily for the optimum engine mode efficient
        internal contoured housing wall 14. A good way to fine-tune the
        value of the A and P parameters is to control the smoothness of
        the calculated confinement wall radius of curvature. This radius
        of curvature continuity can be easily achieved for the no-lobe
        limit case with both A and P positive and less than 0.09, but it
        is not progressive here as other profiles previously reported in
        U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,263. Great care must be taken not to be
        mislead by the appearance of this internal contoured housing
        wall 14 which is far more complex than an ellipse. For the
        example presented here, where the pivot to pivot length is
        L=3.5" and the pivot rubbing pad 47 diameter is D=0.5", the
        internal contoured housing wall 14 radius of curvature in one
        quadrant goes from 2.67" near the x-axis, down to 2.05" near 33
        degrees, up to 4.50" near 65 degree, and finally down again to
        2.60" near the y-axis, which indicates a relative flat zone
        between 33 and 65 degree. This flat zone internal contoured
        housing wall 14 structure is not as obvious in U.S. Pat. No.
        6,164,263, but demands a high precision calculation method. An
        additional interesting exploratory profile parameter is the
        exponent of M(.theta.) in the 0.3 to 3 range, which is not
        detailed here. Notice that the profile complexity depends
        greatly on the selected pivoting blades diamond eccentricity
        (here Ry/Rx=0.8). </p>
      <p>The Saint-Hilaire internal contoured housing wall 14 presented
        on the FIGURES uses nearly the same rotor pivot eccentricity
        (Ry/Rx=0.8) as the Quasiturbine in patent U.S. Pat. No.
        6,164,263. One should notice that increasing the radius of the
        joint-rubbing pad centered on each pivot tends to attenuate the
        high curvature in the corners of the Saint-Hilaire "skating
        rink" confinement profile, but contributes to increase the
        maximum torque, with no net penalty on the specific power and
        weight density of the Quasiturbine, without however achieving as
        stiff a linear ramp pressure that the rolling carriages design
        permits. If the rotor can be made of strong material like steel,
        the pivot rubbing pad 54 radii can be made relatively small and
        lead to the selected internal contoured housing wall 14 shown,
        which is a near optimum Quasiturbine specific power and weight
        density. It is hard to notice by looking at the internal
        contoured housing wall 14 that the radius of curvature
        fluctuates along the profile. Inside the rotor 18, one notices a
        triangular shaped-like chamber making a Modulated Inner Rotor
        Volume (MIRV) 90 in-between the inner surface 24 of the pivoting
        blades 20 and the outer surface 80 of the annular power sleeves
        66, 68 at every rotor pivot 50 location. Changing the shape of
        the rotor 18 for the purpose of producing internal central
        volume variation for an annular pumping application would need
        no rotor rotation, but only a steady on-site "oscillating rotor
        deformation", possibly driven by a rotating external confinement
        profile, or by a x- or y-axes movement. The rotor deformation
        could also be driven from an alternating pressurization of these
        Modulated Inner Rotor Volumes (MIRV) 90, such as to make an
        Internal Rotor. Engine Quasiturbine (IREQ). This calculation
        method does not require profile symmetry through x- and y-axes,
        but only through the central point, which means that the axes
        may not be orthogonal with this same calculation method, in
        which case the confinement profile could be, asymmetrical,
        producing an interesting Quasiturbine with different intake and
        exhaust volume characteristics, and with only minor rotor
        change. </p>
